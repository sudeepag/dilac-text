Mr. Clutchit opened the door, entered
and closed it softly.
Much descriptive genius need not be
wasted in reproducing the picture of the-
premises immediately Loccupied  by the
Clutchits.
The "Hall of Reception " was a square
front room on the first floor of a tenement-
house. At night, by the sudden turning up
of a bed-ounge, it became the sleeping-
chamber of the illustrious pair. The, rear'
room, into which Mr. Clutchit had just es-
caped from the wind, was at once their
private parlor, kitchen, and dining-room.
. The Clutchits always dined at thefashion-
able hour of six, as became people of their
aristocratic lineage and pampered appetites.
The table was spread for the banquet, the
cloth being a copy of an old police Gaete,
Mr. Clutchit's tacked plate being placed
precisely over a cut representing the arrest
of some notorious swindler.
Madame Gringo, se Olutchit, was seated
awaiting his arrival. She was leisurely nib-
bling at a roll and sipping tea from a tin
cup.                       -  -  -1
The honored husband of the, world-re-
nowned Madame threw his hat in a corner
and dropped Iiito his chair, prepared to
anist her in the demolit on ofa tough beef-
steak and rolls.DI

"Ug I no name for it. It's a searcher.

"Dick, I say, people's getting' tired ol

care a fig about what has happened. Nol
even a bite yesterday. It's shameful how
little people care for their future. Only ont

through which the moistute oozed, with Ift

boards which lay loosely upon tht bare
ground in mocking- pretense fort -a floor,
could by any stretch of the imagination be
called a home even for a dog, then it was a
hoes for George Jaffray.
And for two months, the worst and storm-
lest in the year, ever since'they had reached
this the lowest step of their degradation,
ad George Jaffray and his wife found
refuge in this den.
Day after day had he tramped the streets
hungry and xaggad, each day growing more
hopeless anid desperate, each dAy approach-
lag-nearer the tnevitkblebitter end.
Anotaet dafIi% trap eided, bringing him
'ack to his dismal refuge with oaly the
mmory of denial and disappointment-
'h-e mad wind seemed, as it raved and
rhistled past, to mock him in'his despair
-hen for the moment he paused in friont-of
the building, beneath which awaited his
coming the only being in all the wide *ast
city who had clung to him.
"God help me," he muttered as he de-
scended the worn wooden teps leading from
the patenxent down to -the tiineiwracked
door of the cellar. "1Whylshoild I suffer all
this misery IBette die' by tihe haigman's
hand than by this slow terrible, torture of
starvation I"
He pushed open, the door, entered and
closed it. For a second or two he stood
motionless in the darkness.
" Mary 1"0 he called.
No answer came. No sound broke that of
the awful stillness save that of his own
heavy breathing.
"Poor soul, she's asleep. The light has
burned out-burned out as my life willone'
day burn out and be lost in the darkness 'of
death."
He took a. match from, his pocket, and
groped his way to the farther wall.
"Mary I" he called again.
No answer.
a I'll have -a light," he muttered, and
struck the match upon his coat sleeve, and

His halid, thin, roughliike the hand of a
skeleton, with the skin aried aind corrugated
over it, trembled with the coid as he apied
the match to the wick.
"S o  Ican see Iny misery a little plainer.
Ax If it were not plain enough already."
He lifted ,the battle from the barrel, and
turned toward 'what seemed a heap of'rags
in the col-ner fariherest from the door."
"UghI!' it's colder than a landlord's

No sound but that of -his own' voice, ah
that of' the wind.
Over the heap of rags, the pallet upon
which his *ife lay, he stood, then knelt by
hei side, placing the light near him upon
the floor.
"dMary, it is I-George I"
One glance, and the haggard,' famine-

glared as if a inortal agony had con'vulsed
him.
"Dead- dead-dead I" he almost shridked
as he started back from the horrible reality

the frail door crashed open, broken from its

By the dim ligrt of a street lamp, which
flickered in through te new open doorway,

Jaffray's first ipl was. to giv B aa
alarm-to call for assistance; but the thought.
of what would be teresult checle hlim.
To call others in might cause hiz* to be ar.,
rested as the murderer of the. unknown.,
IUs own wrtghoo appearance, and his sur-
roundings, wnuld not plea~d veryp1rongly in
favyr of his innocence or truthfulness. Be.
sidos, he hrew that to believe poverty capa-
ble of copimitting any crime in the eaten.
dar was a cardinal duty of the police.
HoldI he may not yet be dead. Jaffray
bent over the body, and throwing open the
coat and vest, placed his hand dver the
heart.
"There is still life left," Jaifray muir.
inured-" feeble-4h how feeble-yet therI.
is pulsation."

c

In replaping the clothing, and as he with-
drey his hand, his eyes rested upon some-C
thing protruding from: one of the vest
po9kets.
The.moment his flungers closed upon it he
knew by the feeling that it was a roll of bank
notes.
"Money--bank billsI-" fis hand clenchedI
over the little roll like a vice. Then the
thought of his dead wife flashed into hisI
mind. "Poor Mary; these ,would have
saved your life--your life-Too late.-too
late !0 Another thought followed this, upon
whish he acted at once.
He caught the senselfas 'form under the
arms and as carefully as possible dragged it
further nto the darkness of the cellar.
"If I only had a light! Surgly this man
has aqi been robbed. The ruffian, must have
been frightened off, or-"
Silence! He heard the slow tread of sone
one passing upon the pavement above.
"The policeman; much use he is, except
to carry. off the dead after ethe murder's
done.'', The sound of the official's steps died
away, mingling with the far-off noises of the
great etteet beyond. ,.-
Then Jaffray lifted theta wreck of the door4
replaced it'in the opening from the outside,
and Ascending the steps,.hurried down the
narrow street toward the Bowery.
By the light, gleaming -out over the en-
trance to a corner drinking-saloon, he exam-
ined the notes. There were three fiv5-dollar
bills.
Fifteen dollars ! The firstinoney, save per-
hapa 'few shillings, his trembling hands had
grasped in many weeks. His eyeA brighten-
ed. The sight of money in his possession
*as equal to wmonthof surfeit.
Thrusting thenodes hu his pocket, he entered
the salo6n and approached the bir with as
much indifference as in his excited condition
he could assume.'
The saloon was nearly deserted. Two or
three loungers were seated at a table in the
further part of the room lingering over their
last round of drinks, as if loth to leave the
warmth of the place and (begin, their 4ome-
ward tramp through the fierce wind. The

bals of thpe sloon clock marked the h ,M
of twele.
"Bt1randy," said Jaray.
The barkeeper,a young man wiathn'(i
face, high cheek ,bones, a heavy moustache6
keen grey eyes, hair cropped short, aid'with
his shirt sleeves rolled up, handed his cus-
tomer glass and bottle..
As Jaffray raised the glass to his lii-s, he
beheld a smeaT of Mood upon his hand.
The keen-eyed barkeeper noticed it at the
same instant.
To this funetionary, whose liter years had
been passed amid   e,howls and rowdyismi
of east-side gin-shops, the sight of blooA
though niot y any meanson uucnnomgn o0-
currence naturally provoked his curidsity
'out your hand, sir i" he said. o  het
A 1, that brandyis. How'd you cutit I"
"Cut it-no-Only struck it against the
door-post as I came in, that's all" r
Jaffray, shortly.
The barkeeper gave him4 a sharglook e
saw that tes man ,before him, despite the
efforts to conceal his emotion; was laboring
under, the influence of a strong mental z
citeNert. .He noted, too, that the hand,
of his customer, as he held the glass to his
lips, trebled.
"Cold   'nd out," said Jaffra  fter heh d,
drank.
The liquor--and he had taken a tiff dose
of it-seemed to warm him into newlif, 1

drawer and gave Jaffray his change.
Jaffray gathered it up and, shoving it
loosely into the pocket iof his-shabby vast,
with a curt "good night," turned away and
left, the saloon.
"That man's had arough time somewhere.
Lord, how his hand shpok-the hand with

of the men at thg table.

GUROGE JAFFRAY GETS ON TOr OP TIE
CnUsvo
GEORGE JAPPRAY sped on through the
gloom of the night, in defiance of the fierce
wind which seemed to whistle a poverty's
dirge through his threadbare garments. At
last he crossed the street and entered a place
over the door of which, painted upon the
glass, was the sign
"LODGINGS."
'Whatever money he might have with him,
hC'knew that he was in no condition to pre.
sent hmself in a hotel in quest of a room;
his appearance was too suggestive of the
vagabond for-that.'
Having paid the amount demanded as the
price of bed and room for the night, Jaffray
was speedily conducted to them by a half-
asleep, flabby youth, bearing in his grimy
haid a smoky tin lamp.
"Anythin', else," he queried as he placed
the lamp upon the.stand.
NQ ; go I" answered Jaffray.
"D Dy'u want to be called early I"
"Ho; go I I'll call myself ,when I'm
ready-"'
Rum   old rounder, that cove I" mur-
mqured the flabby youth, as he disappeared,
down the dark passage.
Jaffray closed and bolted the door, and
seated himself in the only chair in the nar-
row, cell-like room.

flashing eyes. "DOUBTLkss! He will be

rest for me until my brother's death is aveng-

" In every possible way I will assist you,"
interrupted the banker. "I have been de-
ceived. He has wronged me."
" Wronged you-you out of a few paltry
dollars! Compare that wrong to mine."
"Really, Miss Trainor!"
"Never mind, I came here with .a hope-
faint it is true, that I might be able on my
return hone to bear back to my 'mother
words of cheer concerning Robert's fate;
but I take to her, instead, only ain assur-
ance that our worst fears are realized, and
return to a home that henceforth will be
shadowed with such sorrow as only the
heart of bereaved nidthercan feel. Should
we desire your assistance I will inform you
of It."
Her calmness, suddenly following her
outburst of passion,'so surprised the banker
that he could ontly bow in reply.'
Drawing the veil over her, fade she passed
from the banker's presence,
Mr. Kramnp followed her, closing'the door
behind him.
Jerome Duval was alone.
"So, by this's scoundrel I have been de-
frauded out of twenty-five thousand dollars,
and that girl thinks nothing of it. A woman
is an enigma; no! -she is the epitome of
willful blind stubbornness; my first step in
this affair shall be to put the facts in pos-
session of 9 detective. I will not consult
her-she w6uld muss the whole of it by her
folly."  He touched the bell.
A messenger entered, the banker penned
a note, enclosed it in an envelope, and direct-
ed it.
"Go at once to the police headquarters,
deliver this note, and bring me an answer.
You need not mention the object of your
errand to any one."

Half an hour.latpr the answer came.,
"At ten to-znoromvr Yery wgl. This rnan
who has personated ,bert 'Treinor,,[ anm

His meditation was interrupted by the
entrance of Mr. Kramp with a letter,
"What is thisI"
"A boy brought it; wants a answer,"
grunted the Cashier. The bankei opene4tit.
"Ah, frdus Rogers."'
'Kramp,.does the house owe Rogers any-

"He has been with the house how long?"
"Sevep years."
"Then he should have saved enough to

in form, but still handsome sweet, that's
the term."
"Of course, being a banker's daughter,
she could not be otherwise," interrupted
Duval.
"AgainI You seem to have a strange
dislike to our gods of wealth and their
belongings.".
"I beg pardon.   Accept my second
apology; but really-"
"4Ah, Mr. Glenham, you are hyper-
critical."
"Oh, no. Were I hypercritical I might
say something still more unpleasant; but
his daughter-does she appear in society
often?"
"1 Seldom,"was the Madame's reply.
Mrs. and Miss Trainor, Mr. Glenham-
there just beyond the group around Mr.
Duval, evidently they have just arrived."
"And pray who are they,, Madame Mo-
quard?"
"Very amiable people. Rumor has it
that Miss Trainor is engaged to-." The
reply was unfinished. At that moment
Miss Trainor's face came in full view;
every feature was visible to Glenham.
"My God 2" he almost exclaimed aloud,
"that is the face, the very'face I"
"What is it, Mr. GlenhamI Are you
ill?"
"No, no.   A momentary surprise-a
case of mistaken identity, nothing more I
assure-you."
Madame Moquard gave him    a sharp,
penetrating glance.
"It is the reality of the fce photo-
graphed upon the carte-d&amp;-visite which I
found in the pocket of the dying man on
that terrible night," he said to himself,
"and why has fate led her here to 'my
presenceI" Then aloud:
"Madame Moquard, do you know Miss
-Miss Trainoer's given name?"
"Louise, I believe."
The mystery was out. 'Now Glenham
understood it all. Ths wasLouise Train-
or, the sister of the dead stranger. The
letter beginning yitb ".Dear Iobert," and
signed "Louise,w" was herlast letter to her
brother,'Robert Trainor, and he, looking
In3

then upon her, remembered the words he
uttered when he had read the letter in
that obscure lodging-house in the Bowery
on the night he fled away from the Pell
street cellar
"Out of thousands bearing those names,
Louise and Robert, in this 'vast city, I
might, in ten years' search, happen to find
them."
Glenham, now that the mystery of the
identity of the man to whose terrible mis-
fortune hie'owed his present position, and
that of the sister within his reach, re-
solved to avoid her ; why, will be revealed
hereafter.
" There, Mr. Glenham, isn't he perfectly
handsome? DI'ye see I" broke in Madame
Moquard, pointing to a distinguished look-
ing individual just entering.  "Not to
know him is to argue yourself a stran-
ger-"
"To fashionable religion," interrupted
Glenham.. "Yes; I see him and know
him. He is the Reverend Mr. Pawridge,
who gets ten thousand a year for his good
looks and his capacity for teaching his
high-toned congregation how not to be
followers of the Nazarene."
" Madame the Countess Moquardl -it
was St. Leon who spoke, havee you-a
moment to spare ,"
"Certainly, if Mr. Glonham will accept
-my apologies for deserting him."
f Certainly, for a moment," replied Glen-
ham, smiling.
St. Leon and Madame Moquard bowing,
passed on a few steps and were soon ap-
parently in earnest conversation.
"That Countess is another social riddle
I shall solve one of these days," mentally
noted Glenham. "I think, Robert Glen-
ham," he said to himself, "it will be bet.
ter for you to disappear from this scene."
In pursuance of this mental resotvo he
slowly pushed his way through the "Con-
stantly moving throng in the drawing-
rooms carefully avoiding, though through
no special feeling of fear, the groups'sdr.
rounding Jerome Duval; or wlire Ara-
bella had at that instant taken Miss Train.

"Dear lar. Pawridge," he heard.
Then he saw the handsome clerical
humbug gently stroke his whiskers and
smile, and bow, and reply to the flashily
dressed young lady who had addressed
him. "Ah, Miss Ebbetts-ah-1am happy
to meet you--ahI What a scene this is!
Friendly, kindly intercourse; love-all ex-
emplifying human love, Miss Ebbetts!
Ah--there is my good friend-dear me,
Mrs. Shrugg, I am happy-."
Glenham heard no more. Had he fol-
lowed his mental inclining by a physical
illustration he would have administered
to the reverend disciple of love a sound
kicking.  But he continued his way
towards the door.
CHAPTER XV-
"RIGHT IN THE MInDLE OF THE BUNJA-
LOO," AS INTERPRETED BY 31R. CLUTCH-
IT-WITH THE REVEREND MR. PAW-;
RIDGE'S ACTION THEREON.
WHILE the Reverend Mr. Pawridge was
in the act of explaining to Mrs. Shrugg,
her daughter, Arabella, and her brother,
-m. Namby Shrugg, the reason ofjthe
absence of' Mrs. Pawridge from these
scenes of dazzling light and human love,
there ame an unlooked for interruption.
The cry of "Put him out" was heard
in the hall. 'Then, "How did he get in "
" He's coming up 1" " Where are the ser-
vuntsI" "Theruffian!1"1
Immediately, thereafter a voice broke
-out in song. The voice was not operatic
'y 'any means. It lacked culture slightly,
and the- higher -notes were somewhat
cracked.
From the bustle and confusion it was
evident the singer was bilariously obsti-
nate.,                             ,
" Wout you be quiet!"
 R-r-r-r-erise up Wil-li-am' Rer-r-r-
eriley and come er-eralong with me," ral"
lied the voice.
"Get thepolice!"
"Lemma alone; I'm a gen'l'man and a
child of song!"

BETWEEN TH

"Then upon the hot, perfumed air ar
the sound of a slight scuffle, and present-
ly in the broad arched doorway stood the
obstreperously inclined child of song, ha t
in hand, facg the high and mighty guests
of the blue-blooded Shruggs.
The child of song was Mr. Clutchit,
with the wink of inebriation in his eye-
and the blush of hot whiskey, not to speak
of other fluids, upon his nose.
"Who is he?.1" was the general murmur
pervading the astonished throng, for they
saw by his apparel he was not one of their-
"set.
"Lays andgenelmen-spologise--brupt,
perence-buz 'fac' is (hic) friend o? minez
ere  (hic)-~ I
The hicepough suddenly changed the eur-
rent of his mind and he burst out once
more as a- child of song, and entered, or
rather waved into the room.   Out' he
roared the fragment of an old army chant:
"Nght in the midAle of (hic) the Bunjaloo,
Oh (hie) I love ,Marja(o an ashe lovesh me,
Dunjtloo (hic), Btinjaloo."
At this precise period of his harmonic
exiltation St.' Leon, who, had advanced
nearest him, suddenly amid divers screams
from the' women, grasped Clutehit by the
back of the neck, and was in the' act of
running him  out when .the voice of the'
Reverend Mr. Pawridge was heard.
"Let him go, my friendd..
St. Leon loosened his hold, and' Clutch-
it, in no wise abashed,,faced him.
"Whar-yer-er- jays and gen'men.
" Right in the middle hic) of the ,unjaloo,
Bunjaloo-"
"My friend," said the Reverend. Paw-
ridge, placinghishandgently upon Clutph-
'it's shoulder. "My 4ear friend, permit me
to speak a word 'to you in private, Will
you oblige me I"
Clutchit stared at the reverend gentle-
man and then burst into a roaring laugh,
which was suddenly terminated byva hip-
cough which v7ry nearly made lim dislo-
cgte bis necir.  -- .
" Thas good. I lie) knowae   -p
it, aizza Porrige. Shertenly IMl spl'n.

Mum's the word. I know (hic) you; so-so
(hic) does Mizzus Porrige."
"The fellow's crazy!!" exclaimed one of
the blue bloods at a distance.
"Be careful, Mr. Pawridge, the wretch
may do you some injury!"
And the women added a little chorus of
exclamations expressive of their regard
for the safety of their dear pastor,
"Have no fear," said the reverend gen-
tleman, with a majestic wave of his hand.
"9Words of love will conquer even the
tiger; this is merely a man-"
Right in the (hi) middle of the'Bunjaloo,
added Clutchit-
"Now, this way, my friend, this way;
one word in private, and then we will, if
you desire it, return together ; there, tak e
my arm. My friends," and the pastor
looked around with the same sort of smile
with which every Sabbath morning he
leaned over his pulpit and begun his ser-
mon. "My friends, you see kindness be-
getteth confidence, confidence bringeth
love, and love conquers all. Be kind to
the erring. We are none of us more than
human; we all have our likings-"
"Bour (hic) sour for me," put in Clutch-
it.
"And our dislikes," continued Paw-
ridge, placing his arm tenderly within
that of Clutchit's. "Come, my friend."
Clutchit made no resistance. He mere-'
ly hiccoughed a guttural reference to the
bulojaloo, and with that mysterious and in-
e*plicable swing to his legs which only a
wholly drunken man can successfully ac-
complish, went with his clerical conduct-
or. .
"You need not follow me, friends," re-
marked Mr. Pawridge.. "I will merely
adcompany my good friend , bel9w stairs.
Perhaps some refreshment may restore
him-ah."
No one followed; but the incident af-
forded the throng matter for gossip during
his absence.
Down the broad stairs, at the rear, into
the then dimly lighted basement hall went
Sthe pair.

'Facing them was the heavy door leading
out into the street area.
" Whe.-er-er goin'?" queried Mr. Clutch&amp;
it, thickly.
" Merely where we will not be dis-
turbed," replied Mr. Pawridge,inhis mild"
est accents. He glanced around. There
were none of the servants visible. He
drew the bolt, and opening the door wide
turned to Clutchit, who, by his extreme
quietude, was evidently under the im-
pression that preparations were being
made to invigorate his system with a dose
of bourbon, if nothing better. He was
mentally deciding whether he would take
it hot or cold when his cogitation - was
rudely disturbed.
Mr. Pawridge bad grasped him by the
coat collar with a ferocious grip, and be-
gan bombarding him with a fierce sue
cession of kicks, each one of which almost
lifted him from the floor and towards the
open door.
"You infernal, drunken vagabond, get
out of here (kick). Follow (kick) me, will
you (kick). I understand it (kick) all
(double kick, supplemented with a sound-
ing cuff upon Clutchit's ear from his left
hand), you beast 1'I More kicks, which
brought the. -astnished 'Clutchit to the
threshold. The tremendous assault, so
unexpected,and from such a source, al-
mioDt sobered Clutchit.
" What 've I doke (hie), eh I Godelmi-

Ing with a 'k ik.
"Is--this-wa. what (ie) you-.-call-
call love for a feller, kickin' a drunken
man? Wus than kickin' a cripple."
Mr. Pawridge made no reply to this save
with 4 last and overwhelming kick which
landed- Cltchit on his hands and knees in
the middle of the area. -"There, damn
ou,'? and then Mi. Pawridge in'ediately
added, mentally, "IMay the Lord forgive
the oath."
Clutchit groaned and &amp; ore ,-Mr. iPa-
ridge closed the door,' revolted It, and
turned towards the stairs' just as ydung
Shrugg 'and two or three .of the -guests

were descending them, having been sent
as a committee at the earnest intercession
of the ladies to ascertain the safety of
their dear apostle of love.
" AhI my friends," this in his bland
pulpit tone, "that poor inebriated brother
has this moment departed in peace and full
of the-of the beneficence of love toward
all men, toward you and toward me."
And then they ascended the stairs, while
Mr. Clutchit in the area was gathering
himself into an upright position and mak-
ing his way into the street, tolerably so-
ber, and vowing all sorts of dire and pain-
ful vengeance upon Pawridge.
"lHe's a nice Apostle, he is," muttered
Clutchit. "If some of them women he's
after, and some of the men them women
belongs to knew what an infernal hypo-
crite he is, there wouldn't be any use of
his wife putting me on his track. I didn't
want to spy him, but now, by the jump-
ing Jehosophat, I'll follow him-sober,
too."
CHAPTER XVI.
LOUISE TRAINOR FINDS A CLUE-ST. LEON.
THERE were tlkee persons at that fite
of the Shrugg'b who were far more
troubled, mentally, than either Mr. Clutch-
it or the Reverend Mr. Pawridge, but
upon either of their faces were the masks
of content, or happiness,. or peacefulness,
behind which the babbling throng could
not see. ,
Why should they not hide their face?7Far
better as it is that we all should hide from
the world, from our friends, the troubles of
our lives. Each has his or her own griefs,
anxieties, and daily torments to battle
with, and certainlyis notrefreshed by hav-
ing added to the number, those of others.
Robert Glenham, when he returned to
his hotel, was full of thought, of schemes,
of fancies, concerning the future of the
course he had marked out for himself..
To-night he had been brought face to face

THE CRUSTS.

with Jerome Duval, and there had arisen
before him the fair face and features of

those strange mysteries of life step-by step

of that awful night, and so fix upon him
even the robbery of the helpless victim,
there would be but one more step-the
scaffold. Circumstantial evidence hangs
more men than absolute fact. Fact in
testimony is no more nor less than itself,
it is hard, plain, and absolute; it suggests
nothing to come, and out of it is born no
mystery; circumstantial evidence, vague,
a thing of hints, inuendoes, surprises, and
never complete, a romance and suggestion,
always pointing to something yet unre-
vealed.
Should Jerome Duval recognize him-
there was but little fear of that, however
-but should he, would not that recogm-
tion reopen investigation and so lead to
the forging, despite himself, link by link,
ofa chain of circumstantial evidence which
would drag him down to disgrace?9
He shuddered as his imagination con-
ceived the bare possibility of such a re-
sult.

Never since the hour she had confronted
the stranger in the banking-house of
Jerome Duval had she ceased racking her
mind with the terrible thought. Yet she
had made no outward demonstration of
her intent, or of her mental trouble since
that day. She, too, wore her mask.

stereotyped smile-wasmentallysuffering.

ness, had almost absolute control, over

him, yet the thoughts of the past, of , his
treatment of-his dead daughter and of the
terrible ordeal to which the unexpected
revelation of her death and, as he bnagin-
ed, that of her husband had subjected him
would obtrude themselves.
So far as his conscience was concerned,
is trouble would have been exceedingly
alight, but it.was that intense fear of so-
ciety getting at the facts; of a raking up
of all the old stories of Jaffray's elopement
with his daughter.
There was the real fear of Duval.
From his remaining daughter, Edith, he
had concealed the skeleton in his house
with care and caution until that unlucky
day.
When Edith, by the confession of her
mother, had acquainted herself with all'
the details of the wrong done her sister, a
sister whom she had never remembered,
nor of whom had she ever before heard,
she scarcely knew what course to take.
She would not abandon her mother, yet
she had resolved to remain no longer be-
neath her father's roof if a plausible excuse
could be found for making her home else-
where.
The mother broached the subject to
Duval. He was inflexibly opposed to any
such arrangement.
"What you know You know," said he
to Edith one day; "what else there may
be of our family matters and our troubles
in the past that you do not know, I do
not care to have you learn abroad. Your
home is a palace, Edith; all that my-
wealth can bring you, you well know, is
yours; but to leave my roof to reside
elsewhere is the satisfaction of a foolish
freak I will not permit."
The mother's influence, like his, though
on the wane with the poor girl, for a while
held her in check, but not long.
At several reunions, parties, and in their
box at the opera, she had met Madame the
Countess Moquard. Sometimes that'superb
woman was accompanied by St. Leon, to
whoi Edith had taken an unaccountable
dislike; sometimes with Madame were
other lights of society.

37

One evening, while as yet undetermined
by what ,means, she should get beyond
and out of the dark shadows of selfishness
and pride, and away from the mockeries
which surrounded her in her own home, a
party of young ladies, many of them her
former class-mates in the Spingler Insti-
tute, was made up to attend the opera
'' Traviata" being the attraction with Gaz-
zaniga, then at the height of her popular-
ity, and Brignoli.
Through the invitation of one of the
ladies, Glenham was one of the gentlemen
selected to accompany them.
This brought about an introduction to
Edith of the "grave, quiet, thoughtful
man-so gentlemanly, so reserved, so
polite, and so polished," as one of, the
young ladies in,-her enthusiastic admira-
tion described him to another.
So, by one of the trifling chances of his
every-day life, Glenham found himself in
conversation with the young sister of his
dead wife, the daughter of his bitterest
enemy.
Could that young girl have known to
whom she was speaking, with whom she
was so pleasantly chatting upon the opera,
what might have been the result ?
Had that meetingg not have occurred,
this story might have ended here.
CHAPTER XVI.
ST. LEON5 S TORY--WHEN AND WHERE
sT. LEON MET MADAME THE "COUNTESS"
MOQUARD.
ONE evening, two years prior to the
occurrence of the terrible death of George
Jaffray's wife in the Pell street basement,
St. Leon,-then a stranger in the city, was
standing in front of the main entrance to
an uptown hotel, then newly erected,
looking out upon the crowds which were
passing to and fro along the wide pave-
ment. He was upon the point of starting
off, having lighted a fresh cigar, for a
stroll up the street.
At that moment his attention was at-
tracted by the appearance of a woman in

I


ni

BETWEEN THE CRUSTS.

the passing throng. To him her walk and
demeanor, although she was alone, did
not seem in keeping with what he suppos-
ed might be her calling.
As she turned her face momentarily
toward him, the glaring light of the hotel
gave him a full view of her features. She
was not what he would call beautiful, but
she was handsome; her features were regu-
lar, and he saw none of the hard lines and
traces upon them which indicated a life
passed in dissipation. As she passed she
merely glanced at him, as any lady might,
in common with the rest of the group
upon the steps.
A sudden whim, an unconquerable im-
pulse, induced him to follow her. She
crossed the next corner and, discov-
ering that she was followed, changed her
apparent intention of turning and contin-
ued down the avenue.
Reaching a quiet portion of the street
he came beside her. She looked up, and
as he saw no expression indicating an ob-
jection to his movements, he addressed
her with some common-place phrase by
the way of introducing himself.
She replied pleasantly, yet with some-
thing of reserve. With this introduction
they walked on slowly. Her language, as
they grew more familiar, betrayed a de-
gree of culture and modesty of expression
indicating that the social position from
which she had fallen might have been
above the ordinary level.
Down the avenue they walked until
they reached Twelfth street. By this
time much of her reserve had vanished,
and the two chatted as volubly as if they
were old acquaintances now met after a
long separation.
She informed him that she resided in
St. Mark's Place. He offered his services to
escort her a portion or all the way home,
as she was alone. Jestingly she placed her
arm within his, she felt safer, she said, and
it looked more respectable.
At this moment they came opposite a
fine large residence; she glanced toward
it, then turned her face from it and shud-
dered as if she had caught sight of some

: horrible phantom. He felt her hand con-
vulsively tighten its clasp upon his arm.
He questioned her as to the cause of her
strange emotion; she gave him an evasive
answer, and for a while she appeared de-
pressed. Her gaiety had partially vanish-
ed. Reaching the house in St. ,eark's Place
he paused upon the steps.
His curiosity was piqued to learn the
cause of the sudden change in her demean-
or when opposite that mysterious build-
ing. For the deep and strange interest he
felt in regard to this woman, he could not
account, and he was inclined to laugh at
himself for it. It was the fascination of
the hour he thought,
St. Leon became a constant visitor, and
once or twice escorted her to the theatre.
He discovered that when there was work
in that line, she earned a living by making
artificial flowers, or gave lessons in music.
One day, and despite himself he knew it
would be the inevitable conclusion of the
intimacy out of which lhad grown up for
her an unconquerable love, he proposed
marriage. At first she firmly refused, but
this only the more determined him; at last
she yielded. She then told him the story of
her life. In that he learned that with all
her brilliance and undoubted intellect she
had been the victim of that one great mis-
take -of womankind.
This occurred one year prior to this
meeting with St. Leon, who was about to
become her husband. She was then a
scholar at the Spingler Institute, and rare-
ly missed a day in her regular attendance.
Her parentswere wealthy, though not what
the ton of society would regard as rich,
and resided in New Orleans, and had sent
her to NewYork to complete her education.
There were only her and her sister, three
years younger than herself, for the parents
to idolize. Their every wish had been
gratified, and their future bade fair to be
bright and happy. Both sisters attended
the school, but in different departments.
One day she noticed a gentleman stand-
ing near the steps of the boarding-house
which adjoined the Institute as she came
out with one of her companions. When ho

38

BETWEEN TH
eaughtlier glance momentarily fixed upon
his he raised his hat slightly and smiling-
ly bowed.
The man was well dressed, good look-
ig, and there was an expression of earnest
admiration and respect upon his counte-
nance which the woman could not fail to
notice. She passed on to go out. Next
mornng he was there again, and again
smiled and bowed. For three or four days
this continued, when one afternoon, hap-
pening to go out -earlier than usual she
saw him evidently waiting for her. Then
he saluted her. She hesitated. He found
his advantage in that hesitation, and for
the first time spoke to her, she was fright-
ened, but the apparent sincerity and re-
spect inhis tone reassured her. He walked
beside her to the corner of University
place, but in that interview made no ad-
vances to excite a suspicion. Besides, why
should she suspect, knowing no evil her-
self? A day or two after this she saw him
again, and in return for his bow he receiv-
ed from her a smile of recognition and a
nod. There, thus meeting almost daily,
these simple recognitions merged into
short walks together.
He played a sure game.
From short walks their intimacy grew
into longer strolls, step by step by his spe-
cious artifices he led her to love him, he
promising, entreating, filling her imagina-
tion with dreams of future bliss. While
withhim her home and parents were for-
gotten; When at home he and his protesta-
tions occupied her mind.
She became frequently absent from her
recitations, wenVtoff for long rambles in the
parks and through the bye streets, until
one afternoon she went with him to Tay-
or's. There for the first time he prevailed
upon her to drink a glass of wine, then
another, and yet another.
All the while his serpent tongue beguil-
ing her deeper into the toils. Dazed, be-
wildered by the strange excitement of the
wine, she accompanied him from the saloon
-and she then realized the extent of her
error.
Under various pretexts through all their'

E CRUSTS.                          39
acquiintance he had persuaded her not to
reveal their intimacy to her parents.
Go.back to the Institute to remain she
could not. Go home she dared not, wouki
not. Two or three times she met this
man. He laughed at her, then threatened
her, cowardly scoundrel that he was.
Then she secured 1;oard and apartments
in St. Mark's place. Until this her remit-
tances had come regularly for her from
home. Then they failed. For the first
few ihonths she had a hard struggle
with poverty. Here the thread of her
story is taken up by St Leon, who had
become fascinated with her. He heard
her story, trusted her, married her, and
they took up their abode at a hotel.
Among the few trinkets and keepsakes
she possessed at the time of their mar-
riagehe had noticed the carte de visited por-
trait of a young man. Questioning her
in reference to it, he found that she al-b
ways evaded direct reply, and not desir-
ing to cause her pain, he finally ceased
his inquiries. But he impressed upon his
memory the features of the portrait. He
trusted her and loved her as a man
should do.
Some weeks after their marriage, re-
turning homeward one evening from Nib-
lo's Garden, St. Leon suddenly pro-
posed a walk up Broadway instead of the
usual carriage ride. Strolling on up they
reached Grace church, then crossed over
toward the Astor Place hotel.
As they stepped upon the. curbstone,
her arm resting lovingly in his, she sud-
denly started, partially drew back, and
he felt her hand grasp his arm in the
same convulsive effort as it did on the
evening when- they  passed the insti-
tute.
As he looked up to see the cause of
her strange terror, he beheld only one
person, a young man, well dressed, smok-
ing a cigar and standing in the entrance"
to the hotel.
One glance was sufficient, the face was
the original of the face of the carte de
visit he had seen in her possession.
The man was in the act of bowing in a


BETWEEN THE CRUSTS.

mocking manner when his eye caught
that of St. Leon; on the instant he disap-
peared into the hotel.
St. Leon made no comment then, but
arrived at their hotel he at once told her
he recognized the person on the steps of
the St. Denis as the original of the por-
trait, and demanded who he was, and
why his appearance had such an effect
upon her.
She revealed the secret, for she said
that further concealment might bring
upon her distrust, and a suspicion of her
fidelity. He took the portrait. Upon the
back of it was written the name "Mo-
quard."
CHAPTER XVIIL
ST. LEON AND HIS LITTLE TROUBLE.
APTER all, the secret which she revealed
to him concerning the man of whose fea-
tures St. Leon caught a glimpse as he
suddenly disappeared from the entrance
of. the Astor Place Hotel was scarcely
more in its revealment than a realization
of what he had suspected. He knew
there was a mystery connected with his
life; he knew before they were married
that whatever it might be it would sooner
or later be unveiled.
" Moquard !",
That was the name.
The man whom he saw in that single
glance was evidently a man of the town;
in dress, in manner; the mocking siile,
the easy graceful gesture as the stranger
half saluted his wife was convincing proof
to him of a previous intimacy, perhaps
closer than she was willing to acknowl-
edge.
She confessed enough, however. Enough
to show that she had loved before.
The carte de visite he retained.
It was St. Leon's nature to be an adven-
turer.  A man who never fought with
lifek or fortune, but one who through his
shrewdness almost invariably contrived to
keep side by side, a boon companion, with
both luck and fortune.
His sudden affection for her was real.

It was perhaps the, first time in his life
he had ever become infatuated with aught
of womankind.
An adventurer himself, a yreyer upon
society, and always ready to plunder it by
any trick or device which his fertile brain
might suggest, even in the very height of
his infatuation was not blindly led by it
into absolute faith and trust in the honesty
and fidelity of the woman he had married.
He suspected she might betray him at
any moment. Her past life, despite her
plausible and certainly pathetic story of
her early life, had not been pure; the sud-
den trembling and exhibition of fear at
the sight of the strange man---the original
of the face upon the carte de visite-were
to St. Leon evidences of a deeper mystery
in regard to him than she had cared to
confess.
Did she still, despite her story and
statement to the contrary, know the resi-
dence of this man "Moquard?1"
After his discovery, on the evening in
question, of the relation of this man Mo-
quard, he narrowly watched his wife's
movements with a wary eye. He wanted
to believe in her, wanted to believe that
there was one person who could be true
and constant, and thus set at naught his
doctrine that society-mankind-were but
a crowd of vultures and kites, and that
deceit, knavery, and cunning were a part of
their nature.
With the carte de visite in his possession
he was determined to solve the mystery,
whenever chance should happen to bring
him in contact with the stranger.
Should his suspicions be correct, and he
discover that she had deceived him in
the story she had told, it was no part of
his scheme to discard her. Such an idea
lie never once entertained. He needed
just such a confederate, a woman whom
the conflict with the rougher chances of
life had rendered callous to the finer feel.
ing of her nature. If he could mold her
to his purpose and use her in furtherance
of his plans, whatever they might be, he
did not much care.
By adroit practices, by the arts and

cinning of the bold ard shrewd reaper
in the field of human credulity, he had
acquired not only all the airs and appear-
ance of refinement of the courtly man of
society, but a sufficiency of means to sup-
port it. Bye-and-bye, something of an es-
trangement came about between St. Leon
and his wife. They had not quarreled,
yet an inexplicable coolness had slowly,
almost imperceptibly, grown up between
them. Still she served his interest as best
she could
"We can live together or apart," he
said to- her one day, " it matters little as
to that formality, ,but whichever course
you may prefer it need not prevent one
helping the other when necessary. You
are a woman of the world, why need you
care what the world may say of you I1
If we meet in society as mere passing
acquaintances, or as apparent strangers,
so much the better, for then collusion
will not be suspected."
And thus, as the coolness in affection
grew up between them, the bonds of self-
interest became stronger and held them
mutually in each'other's, service.
One day in July following the date of
his marriage, St. Leon bethought him of a
jaunt to Coney Island.
Perhaps there might be profit in it,
mingled with whatever of pleasure the
trip iigh afford.
Arrived upon the Island towards even-
ing, he wandered into one of the hotels
near the beach, lit a cigar, and seated him-
self upon the veranda.
CHAPTER XIX.
THE BRUNETTE OF THE ISLAND-ST. LEON
OPENS THE TRAIL WHICH LOUISE TRAIN-
OR IS TO FOLLOW.
WHILE sitting there listening to the
washing of the long sweeping waves as
they rolled up upon the sand, St. Leon's
attention was attracted by the arrival of a
couple of young women, both in their way
more than ordinarily handsome-the one a

41

blonde the other a dark-eyed brunette.
They had evidently just arrived.
Their arrival so late, at the time when
the Island was fast being deserted by visit-
ors, perhasps caused him to notice them
more particularly, as it was evident from
this lateness that they intended remaining
over night.
The blonde and brunette entered the
reception room-the low porch windows,
or doors rather, of which opened upon the
veranda where he was seated. As they
entered he heard one of them order supper
-and as a preliminary thereto a sherry
cobbler and a milk punch.
From his seat directly opposite one of
the windows by a slight change of position,
he was enabled to see and notice their ap-
pearance and action ; not only that but in
the stillness around, that weird? still-
ness which comes only with the night upon
the sea shore -to hear their conversation
as if uttered in an ordinary tone.
The brunette sipped the milk punch
while the blonde solaced herself with the
lighter exhilaration of the sherry cobbler,
and now, as they sat there awaiting their
supper, he noted their appearance more
closely. The blonde was petite in form, but
well formed, lively, quick in motion, and
wore that peculiar facial expression of
archness and coyness which to even an
ordinary observer would suggest the pre-
sence of a mask concealing the real nature
of the woman. Her dress was not "4loud "
in style, or in the contrast of colors-it was
appropriate to the season-neat, elegant,
and in keeping with her complexion. She
was in style, action, and look a foil to the
brunette. And the brunette was a nagni-
ficent type of the blase woman of pleasure,
playing, with an almost indescribable air
of reality, the part of a woman of fashion.
Taller than her companion, voluptuous
in form and in every motion of her rounded
limbs, and with no action of her well poised
head that was not in itself a study for an
artist, she sat there with the easy grace
and nonchalant air of one Nyose role was
to command, and who had yet to learn the
meaning of the word fail in whatever in-

trigne or duplicity she attempted. An
enchantres-fair to the sight, but in
reality false, calculating, cold, and as im-
placable as destiny. A Juno in form, a
Venus in beauty, a Hecate at heart.
Through all her grace, b auty, and
queenly fascination was discernible the
traces of a hardened life. As she arose to
cross the room  with her companion, in
answer to the summons to supper, there
was in her walk the peculiar swagger, but
partially hidden by the lithe gracefulness
of her step, which marked her most inti-
mate associations to have been with men
rather than women. Her carriage was
bold and half-defiant, yet withal temper-
ed by the studied effort she made to con-
ceal it.
Half an hour afterward they came out
upon the veranda and lit a couple of ciga-
rettes. After a few whiffs the blonde
threw hers away but the brunette contin-
ned to the end, lit another, and when it
was finished the pair stepped from the
veranda and strolled off to the beach.
They then returned and retired for the
night. St. Leon, his curiosity piqued, re-
solved to remain until next day himself
upon the Island, and so enjoy the glories'
of the early morning at the pea shore.
As to these women, that they were'
adventuresses there could be no doubt,
harpies of some sort, and that they were
there to play their part in one of the many
games by which the unwary are entrapped
was reduced to certainty.
While they were seated near the open
window leading to the veranda a light
wagon was driven up and in it were two
men.
The eldest of the two was evidently a
sport of the sort, that may be seen-any day
lounging about hotel steps or in the neigh-
borhood of first-class saloons. The gray-
tweed summer suit, 'the heavy watch
chain, the cluster diamond pin in his
bosom, the sharp, watchful eye, the hard,
worn look of the features, and that name-
less expression of cunning which pervaded
his whole appearance, bore the stamp and

BETWEEN THE CRUSTS.

seal of his profession as a gambler and
sharp.
His companion was plainly, at least so
St. Leon thought, not of his class. He,
had that open, fresh, hearty look which
the professional gambler never has; there
was health and strength in his movements.
Clad in white duck pants, dark coat
and vest-fitting neatly-a light summer
hat of the farhionableg$ray, a neat but not
showy watch chain and charms-these
attributes enumerated and you have the
man. That he was too honest in appear-
ance for the company he was in was no
great discovery for St. Leon to make.
As they leaped from the vehicle the
elder individual exclaimed,," Come lot's
have a drink.
" That's me I" was the reply.
But, as he stepped upon the veranda,
he caught sight of the two women who
were just then testing the virtues of
another cobbler and punch.
The blonde scarcely noticed him, but the
brunette gave him one glance only. He
was "struck."  The glamour of fascina-
tion at first sight was upon him as it has
been upon thousands since woman's crea-
tion. The miser who would not give a
cent to save a fellow being from starvation
will barter all he has, and his soul into
the bargain, to win the smile of a woman,
The glance shot out from those dark
eyes acted upon that young man like .a
magnet.
ie stepped across into the room where
they were seated.
The mystery of the women and their.
object began slowly to develop itself.
He bowed. While the.blonde demurely
turned partly away the brunette looked
him squarely in the face as if to read his
character and nature thoroughly, yet her
look was not bold. There was a thin pre-
tence as if of surprise in it at his temerity.
Missing him for the moment his com-
panion, the sharper clad in gray, caught
sight of him; then went to the threshold
of the door and beckoned.
But the victim was enthralled. The
dark eyes of the brunette were upon him,

Was his companion trying to save himI
Again he bockonid-the two came to-
gether a moment-then St. Leon, still
sitting on the veranda, beard the man

gusted with the   other's infatuation,
4 Pve warned you-I've nothing to say.
As for me, d--d if IPm to be caught in
that way. Im off.n
They parted. The younger returned
to the women and ordered wine and
luncheon, while the 'sharper sprang into
the carriage, and drove rapidly away.
Presently the party, now seemingly on
the best of terms, arose and strolled down
towards the beach.
Keeping them in sight, St. Leon fol-
lowed.
The play began to be interesting to him.
The brunette and the young gentleman
were certainly charmingly intimate for
such a short acquaintance. The blonde
seemed almost neglected. They went in
for a bath.
The beach by- this time began to be
crowded.
After bathing, as they came down from
the dressing-house, St. Leon passed them.
As he did so he beheld ahead of him
and crossing the beach a few hundred
yards off, the shaper in gray, whomhe
supposed had driven back to the city,
and abandoned his friend.
A little distance up the shore and sep-
arated from a long row of bathing-houses
by a wide open space of ridgy sand and
stunted grass stood an old desertedshanty,
and directly in front of it lay a great heap
of seaweed and brush. Still with his
face turned toward the group he hurried
rapidly toward this shanty. He had
scarcely entered it, when three men came
out of it walking quietly, and taking a
wide circuit, reaching the centre of the
beach directiy in a line with the ap-
proaching party, who were coming on
slowly at some distance behind.
As the three then executed this ma-

nouvre the sharper at the shanty had
placed himself partly in the shadow and
stood'gazing toward thbiparty as intently
as if he were watching the progress of a
desperate battle.
The three men halted upon the beach,
and one of them soon revealed the nature
of their business by the sudden setting up
of a three-card monte rig, an exceedingly
simplecontrivance. This being done, one
or two other apparently disinterested in-
dividuals came strolling up. He knew
these must be, by their unnistakable
" get up," the cappers and steerers for
the game.
St. Leon turned from them, and lo I di-
rectly behind him came the brunette and
blonde with their new-found escort. He
appeared perfectly happy.
Nearer and nearer to this little open-
ing for business approached the two girls
and their compamon.
And nearer, too, sauntered St. Leon.
He heard one of the cappers ask the
others: " Isthata 'Sat' "between them?7"
And the other answered, " Stash it,
dy'er ever see Lib without one down
here ?"
As the party came still nearer to the
noble and refining game of three-card
monte the rappers began making a great
show of being utter strangers to the op,
ration and played the part of innocent
but interested strangers with a degree of
perfection which would have done them
credit upon the stage.
St. Leon glanced over toward the
old shanty. There, still watching like a
tireless sentry, stood the sharper.
In a few moments more the brunette
and her companion, her face flushed with
the exercise, and his with excitement over
what he considered his easy conquest,
while the blonde with no special change
in her appearance, except that she had
become, as we have seen, upon familiar
terms with the "Flat, "  were within
reaching distance of the monte table.
" Oh, Minnie," said the brunette," there's
,hat game I was telling you about yester-

day-let's look at them. I should like to
bet something just for the fun of it."
The gallant-who evidently was no ex-
pert in the mysteries of this sort of thing
-made no objection to the fun. So blind-
ed was he in his not-at-all strange in-
fatuation for the girl that nothing short
of an earthquake could have brought him
to kee what a fool he was making of him-
self. By listening closely to them
St. Leon discovered his name, or rather
the one which he had given her. She
said, "Come, Mr. Devoe, what time is it 'I
Isn't it late?"
He took out his - watch-a fine gold
English lever, a Frodsham probably-and
answered her.
The two cappers glanced at it, and at
each other.
Then for the first time St. Leon noticed
a stealthy, almost imperceptible sign of
recognition pass between the dealer of
the monte and the brunette.
So, so, the plot thickens, and is deeper
than we thought.
The " tuae of day " was then a stall,
that the cappers and dealer could learn
at sight the value of the victim's watch.
The gambling valuation of such an
article is averaged at one hundred dollars
for a gold, and twenty-five for a silver
"ticker."-
Meanwhile he watched the proceedings
closely.
" I'll bet ten dollars, Minnie," said the
brunette, "I can tell what card that is."
" Well." said the dealer, "I don't like
to bet with ladies, ma'am - but just forthp
fun of it, I will."
So the bet was made, much against the
will of the young man, the " Flat."
She placed her finger upon the card.
It was turned, and she had guessed
right and won.
The dealer doesn't mind the loss but
smiles over it as if it were a matter of
course that he should lose. He now takes
up three cards.
" Perhaps the ladies and gentlemen
think these cards are too much worn. I'll
change them for a new set.

CHAPTER XX.
TEE CONTINUATION OF THE LITTLE GAME..
As he spoke he made a motion to place
them in the breast pocket of his coat.-
" No, no, we don't want 'em changed,"
said one of the cappers, "let 'em be;
them's good enough."
"Of course we know these, and new
ones might not be so lucky for us. Be-
sides," this she said to her victim, that is
his name now; "I'm going to win some-
thing more."
"Very well," said the dealer. "Just as
you say." But even as lie spoke and
withdrew his hand from his pocket, St.
Leun saw that he had changed the cards
and produced a new set.
"No, no change; I'll hide the same
three." He threw the cards upon his im-
provised table.
" Now then," continued the dealer, "I'll
bet three hundred dollars that no gentle-
man can turn the jack of hearts. Any
gentleman can bet; I'm ready. Three
hundred dollars that no gentleman can
turn the jack of hearts! "
"I haven't so much money as that,"
said the brunette, throwing one of her
witching glances at her victim, at the same
time, with a pretended sigh of regret,
looking into her peat little pocket-book.
" What an awful sum of money that is!
But if I had it I'd bet it that I know which
is the jack of hearts as you call it.'
Was innocent simphcity ever so charm-
ingly imitatedI
" Yes, and so would I," chimed in the
blonde, with a fascinating naivete, and
giving the 'FlatI the benefit of a be-
witching glance with her blue eyes.
Then one of the cappers put in his verbal
oar, speaking, however, in a tone just loud'
enough to be heard only by the two women
and their prey, "Let's raise the money
among us, each put up what we've got.
Miss there got the card dead sure."
" What's the use of putting up so high I
You know none of us ain't got no such
stake as three hundred dollars! Come now
let u, a bit," said the other capper to the
dealer.

At this instant, St. Leon standing near
and apparently an uninterested speaker,
thought of the sharper who had driven the
light wagon up to the hotel.
He looked'over toward the old shanty.
The man was there, but he had moved
back a little further into the shadow, and
bis foot was no longer resting upon the bit
of seaweed.
Still his gaze was fixed upon the group
around the three-card monte game, and he
seemed as motionless as the wind-wrecked
shanty beside him.
"Not a cent less than three hundred
dollars, gentlemen," said the dealer in that
hard metalic tone peculiar to his class, and
with'a pretense of not noticing the two
women.
St. Leon drew still closer, forhe saw that
the plot of the swindlers was rapidly cul-
minating to a finale of success. Blindly
lured to his fate through his infatuation
for the dark-eyed enchantress whose hand
at that moment carelessly, as if by acei-
dent, rested upon his shoulder, the young
man drew his pocket-book.
"Let me see, ladies, how we can fix it.V
Then turning to the brunette-"  you're
sure you know the card 1"
She gave hima glance-that was enough.
Away with caution, common sense;, their
power melted away before.'the burning
sensual sparkle of the "trained wanton's
eyes like ice in the heat ot the summer
sun.
"Let me see," he repeated, taking out a
roll of bills.
We'll go in fifty dollars-twenty-five a
piece," said each of the cappers.
"You're ,very obliging," said the bru-
nette, laughing. "Well,'here's my ten."
"4Poor me, and I've nins," said the
blonde.
At this moment, as the young man was
counting the roll of bills, we saw the dark-
eyed sorceress look tiowrd the old'slinty,
where stood the sharper; she gave a nod.
ie answered the signal by one in re-
St. Leon 'would have gi4exi something
handsome in the way of rewardif the vic-

tim could have seen just then what we
did.
" Now, then," he said, here'ss two hun-
dred dollars."
"And here's my ten," put in the bru-
nette.
"No, keep that," said the victim as un-
conscious as a babe of the stall being
played upon him. "This is all I've got,
but you're suie you know the card I Yes.
Then we're all right, and we'll have a gay
old wine supper over our winnings."
" Come, gentlemen," said the dealer
"There's my three hundred dolla-,s, solid
cash, nothing less."
"Oh cme," said one of the cappers.
"This gentlemen's got two hundred, and
here's our fifty ; call it an even bet of
two-fifty."
"Not a red less than than three hun-
dred. If the gentleman with the two
hundred hasn't any moro money conve-
nient, and he's so sure of winning, I'll give
him a chance; I'll take his check for the
balance, or any kind'of security."
The victim's pride was touched. He
had waded into the stream; - ware he to
falter or show the white feather now, hO
would lose his hold of the enchantress at
his side.
There had gathered eight or ten morb
of the strollers on the beach around the
spot, and their presence added an ther
stimulus to his action.
"Oh, I do wish I was near home, rd
soon get the money,' exclaimed the bru.
nette..
That sentence settled it with her b6-
witched victim.
"l1ere,"he said, taking out his watch and
dethching the chain from the button-hole;
will this do in place of the extra fifty. It's
worth-"
" Oh, don't do that," pleaded the bru-
nette. "Don't. risk your watch on ac-
co6un; of my foolishness. Perhaps, 'fte

mingled with tnat other and equally as
enthralling passion, that of winning.
Satan is represented as a male. It is a
mistake.  The spirt of cool, heartless
calculating evil in one of these woiqen
was more'devilish and relentless than that
of a dozen Satans. And the ungloved
hand of the brunette, as she uttered her
hollow plea to prevent hi parting with
his watch, was toying with a golden cross
suspended from a golden chain over her
heart..
Satan cowers, so the preachers tell us, in
the presence of that symbol; the woman
toys with it.
" Oh,,pshaw," said the victim. "Here,
it's oply for a moment; tai e it."
The watch was deposited with the two
hundred and the cappers' fifty.
"Now then, gentlemen.'
The crowd pressed forward.
The brunette, with her arm clinging to
her prey, who, as the supreme moment
which was to decide the wager, approach-
ed, became terribly anxious.
"If you please," said the brunette, her
face lighting up with a gleam of triumph
as she reached out her hand towards the
three cards.
"This is- the ' card, THE JACK  OF
HEARTS I "
$je turned it.
'Every eye was fixed upon the young
man's face.

Watch and money was gone! The
dealer gathered in the stakes and put up
big eards.
"ify God, is it possible," exclaimed the
victim, "money, watch-rnot a cent left I"
The brunette led him away, and with
the witching of her warmly but low spoken
expression of sorrow, soon soothed his
feelinqgof disappointment.,
With the blonde jnd brunette on either
side of him,, completely inthe toils, he
slowly walked toward the lotel.
St. Leon heard the brunette Satan say to
him as they passed from his hearing,
"Never mind, my ten dollar bill is left.
I will' lend it to you. We will have some

wine, and when you see me in-" He
heard no more then.
St. Leon glanced toward the old shanty
The sharper was -tiere no more. The
monte ,dealer was slowly moving further
down the beach followed by the cappers
and presently, from behind a row of the
dressing houses beyond, emerged the
sharper-or really the steeredr " of that
profitable job-and joined his fellow
swindlers.
CHAPTER XXI.
SOME RECOGNITION AND PLANS.
Sr. LEON sauntered thoughtfully back
to the hotel, reseated himself- upon the
veranda and lighted a fresh cigar.
The features of therblonde were famil-
iar to him, and as for the sharper who had
kept solitary vigil at the old slianty-hi%
face, too, now came back as one that he
had met elsewhere-where he could not
recall.
As he sat there ruminating upon the
probable fate hereafter of the' victim of
these male and female swindlers, he felt
a tap upon the shoulder.
He-looked up.
He had heard no step, so that the light
and unexpected touch of the hand start-
led him from his reverie. He looked up,
and beside him stood the blonde heroine
of the day's work.
" Mr St. Leon, can I speak with you a
moment."
St. Leon!
How should she know his name. Yet
as she looked down upon him there came
to him the dim photographic 'memory,
an indistinct familiarity in the face, but
to trace it in its present guise was
impossible.
He made no betrayal, however, of hi.
real thought-he waa too thorough a man
of the world for that.
"You see I know you, although you ma r
not remember ,me--s by,the expression
of your features I amIn'clined to thin4
, ou do not," said theblonde.
"As you are now," he replied yleaa

V

antly,"I certainly admit I do not recog-
nize you."
" Ah !" she said, and as she spoke she
glanced around nervously. "Perhaps I"-
she broke off abruptly, and then said in a
low tone-" Lib is listening-or rather,
both watching and listening."
" LibI-OhI "St Leon turned his glance
away for the moment.
He saw as he said this the sharper of
the shanty slowly walking across the
sands.
"I thought that fellow had disappeared
altogether, and there he is," he thought.
The blonde seemed to hesitate.
Then she whispered-" I will see you
again, Mr. St. Leon, in a.few moments."
"Very well,"he replied.
The sharper came nearer, came up upon
the veranda, and merely giving St. Leon a-
casual, but as that individual noticed, a
shaip inspection-passed on into the bar-1
room of thehotel.
"I know him now," mentally exclaimed
St. Leon. "I recognize him now, as well as
if he were an old familiar friend. How
the faces of those we detest come back to
us ! I know him now."
He took from his pocket the photograph
of the'man of the St. Denis hotel steps.'
"It is the sante, I'll be sworn."
While he was looking at it, the blonde
came to him again.
"Come with me," she said.
St. Leon looked up into her face. There
was an expression of singular earnestness
which impelled him to consent, although
he hid his doubts as to her motive.,
He followed her. Not into the dining-
room, not into any remote portion of the
veranda, but to an upstair chamber.
Then-the two being there, she closed
the door and locked it.
St. Leon looked in somewhat of as-
tonishment:   ,
41 Y ou have locked the door ."'
"46Yes.7'
49 That is not right)
"Every thing, -Mr. St. Leon, is right
whbh will bring justice to all."
.Certaizly, but what has justice to d

with a closed door; 'or an interview be
tween strangers I"
"Justice has no single abiding place
Justice is everywhere. She may choose
to bide herself for a while but she wili
surely in the end appear. Time is justice.
for time brings to all in the end-relief."
St. Leon listened. He began to have p
better opinion of the blonde.
"You wonder at the locking of the door.
If you desire it I will unlock it. What I
had to,say to you was private; as private
positively as the personal bank account of
Alex Stewart."
" Certainly if what you have to say is
private-no better place than this could
have been chosen," said St. Leon. "Coney
Island is not quite so. public a place as
Broadway, to my thinking."
"You can be seated if you like, or  f
you prefer standing we can converse
equally as well. Here "-as she spokeshe
handed him the key of the door-" here is
the.key, you can keep it until our inter-
view ceases. You see that I know your
name. I, know more of you than that.
Now listen to me. I saw you here yester-
day, but*I preferred not to acknowledge
the recognition. You were close upon us
through the whole time we were, down
upon the beach. Now, candidly confess to
me before I proceed further, what special
object had you in view in thus playing the
spy upon the party?"
, St. Leon smiled. Then he answered--
" In what manner will our interview, or
what you mxay have to say be influenced
by such a confession.? However, I will
confess so much as this: that in watching
you and your confreres in swindiing--"
" Swindling 1"
"I know no other name for the busi-
ness-in watching you, and your cop-
freres my principal object was to gee how
great a fool a man in the toils .f design-
ing women cot1dmake of himself, and how
beneath their smiles and losing glances
and tender manifestations oft regard they
could so adroitly. conceal ,o upuchjoold,
heartless depravity."
" You're quite a philosopher, S, Leon.

Now, sir, as an appendix to that frank con-
fession, you should add that your own ex-
perience in the art of swindling enabled
you to more readily appreciate the per-
formance of other experts in the same
line." )
"I was not aware that my character
was open to such grave suspicion."
" Well, well, this sort of badinage is
useless, we can indulge in that amusement
at some more fitting opportunity. St.
Leon, I said I knew you, yet you do not
recognize me 1"
"Really, I do not."
"Did you recognize the man who
passed us but a few moments before we
came up here I The same who yesterday
came here with Lib's companion '1"
"I d not at first, since then I have
recalled him; I do know him now, perfect-
ly."
" Did you recognize the young man who
came with him?",
69I never saw him before. However, my
memory of faces is not always the most
perfect, it is like all human attributes-
treacherous."
"You are married, and it is of your
marriage I have to speak, for it is that
which has brought about this interview.
As I know there is a cloud between
you and your wife--a distrust on your part
and a fear on hers-"
" This is strange knowledge for you, a
stranger, to possess in reference to ny
private affairs."
" She told you she came from New Or-
leans, did she not ?"
" She-she did."
" And she revealed to you a very pretty
romance of her own life-eh 1"1
St. Leon made no answer. The wotnan

before him seemed an enigma.
4 She even made you-a man of the
world, 'an adventurer-believe it ?"
" I have no reason to disbelieve it. Is
there no truth in womankindf" he half
answered, half questioned, bitterly,
She smiled, then a shade of sad earnest-
ness crept over her' features as she con-
tinued.                     .

"Now let me enlighten you. Weeks
ago I intended to have seen you personal-
ly, but circumstances intervened which
postponed the satisfaction of my desire.
Your wife never saw New Orleans!"
"What !"
"Her parents of whom she spoke so
affectionately died during her infancy."
"Go on-this is becoming interesting."
"The man whom you met here but a
little while since was her paramour-had
been her paramour-her lover if you like
the word better-for two years before you
saw her for the first time,"
" Well!"
"But the man who betrayed her, who
first led her into the dark depths out of
which even your love, or the love of any
human being will never lift her, the man
who loved her to distraction and, left her
heart cold and sordid to all the world
beside, is the man who was the victim of
the three-card monte game on the
beach !"

"Well, this is sensational,, whatever
may be its veracity. It is a delicious bit
of seasoning between the crusts of thispie
men call society. Go on, you see I am
calm, unruffled, as if I were listening to
the pleasant story of a boon companion
told over a glass of sparkling hock."
"Your wife is my sister / 4
"What next '1"
"This man, the sharper as you choose
to -term him, is not so bad as he seems.
He was once what the world calls a re-
putable member of society; with his fall,
if fall there was in his conduct, I have
nothing to do at present."
St Leon threw himself back upon a
lounge in a half reclining posture.
" The name ofthis admirable friend of
my wife is Moquard 1" said St. Leon.
"Yes-I was not sure you knew it."
"How- can I, avoid it when here, upon
the back of this photograph of his exebed-
ingly attractive countenance, it Is written.

is ghostly hour -f midnight when silence
and its sister soltude reigned supreme inI
the darkness.',
Those who occupied it were of the most
ancient of the republican aristocracy.
Beside them 'the Shrugga shrank back
aghast. Even Jerome Duval envied theseI
claimants of the blue blood of the Knick-
erbockers,  ,'' I   ,  .  . .      ,
The residences of these descndants of
the Schweitzer Deadstones, w)o were no4
doubt the original Dutch ,wbocaptured
Holland, and of the Shruggs, and of the
banker Duval were indicative of the char-
acter of the occupants.
The Shra'gg mansion was -a' bazaar of
flash, gilt, arid extravagance - modern,
new, and outre, every bit of it.
Duval's "home," was costly, magnifi-
cent, showing everywhere "ihe pride of
wealth but in no part, save Edith's apart-
ments, displaying the presence of refine-
ment or culture.
But the Echo mansion, solid, substan-
tial, and old; the furniture heavy and
massive, of a fashion then almost forgot-
ten, and everything imposing and impres-
sive.
To be sure, the occupants to.whom we
refer were not so much Knickerbocker,
save in their exclusiveness, as the Dea4
stones who preceded them,,but they were
the' top, on the very; topmost knob of
the top crust.
Judge if you can by these Deadstones
*hat appalling beings, how utterly un-
approachable to the vulgar crowd were
the Schweitzer Deadstones of Manhattan
who were intermingled by marriage' with
the Diedrichs, thIe Knickerbockers, the
Stuyvesants, the Kimmels, the Corlears,
and all the rest of those noble fainilies
who themselves were the immediate de-
scendants of the puissant blooded stock
who helped the Dutch to take Holland-.
The occupants, the Deadstones,'receiv-
ed only the highest class, tolerated the
Shrugs and Duvals, an4 were" merely,
oidescn4inglj Iffable with such ques
tionable tables as Madame the Count-
ess Moquard' and St. Leon,

With the Trainors, mothervand daugh
ter, they were more .than  rdiarily in-
miliar, the Trainors being oil verylold
stock, and withal, never had 4itermarried
any of the lower orders obIlater 4ate.
Robert Glen1a swas ma4e weWoD*
there through an introduction by one of
the "blooded stock," and Gleuham, who
had the early history of New York and
its ancient burghers at Is tongue's end,
quickly~made himself acceptable and was
received as one of the veritable  bloods."
Here, then, one day Louise Traiuor mak-
ing a call, met Glenham.
Since bio recognition of her at the
Shrgg fete as -being the original of the
carte de isitephotograph he had found
among the -papers' of -the victim of the
Pell, street horror, be had not seen her.
He dared not reveal what he knew. of'
the fate of her brother,-without incutfting
the risk of-himself being exposed, of hav-
ing, all his plans come .to naght, and,
perhaps, bring with it the suspicion that
he was even concerned In bringing about
the brother's terrible fate.
It was byiner accident that op this
particular afternoon Glenham had" drop-
ped "into this Peadstone mansion,.
Of the Deadstones there, was old:Dead-
stone, in ancient-cut. of coat, and pants,
patriarchal jeard, goldspectacles, weak
voice, sharp nose, few teeth, and a general
lai4-onethe-shelf appearance; Mrs. Dead-
stope, little, odd,,thin-lipped, loquacious,
neatly dressed, kindly in manner, and re-
garded by the servants as the .legitinate
head of the house; Miss Letitia Deadstone,
young, gay, sensible, homely as to feature,
elegant as to dress,: with a :good hon-
est smile for everybody (so everybody
thought who 'accepted what they beheld
as gospel truth); and a hearty welcome
ever ready for a few of thehigh-tonedfa-
vorites she ha4 taken int her confiednce
in that lofty circle inyhich they moved.
This conmpleted-these three-the fam-
fly group at hone.
There was a son, but he was off some-
where in Europe, playing billiards with
foreign nobs, or the deuce with foreign

q

ladies-at least he wrote so-andhe'never
wrote unleEs the necessity Of a fresb' de-
posit at his banker's camee necessary.
Louise Trainor was one 9f the Miss
Deadstone's f&amp;orite, and they we.ie often
together.
They were so seated together in one of the
great parlors, surrounded by a cordon 'of
high-backchairs with their grotesque carv-
ings Ad solemnly glared down upon by
two or three, dim-faced, faded-eyed por-
trait3, eind which a battalion of echoes
were no doubt lirg in wait ready to
bounce out into space at the fist available
opportunity.
Lis and Letitia seated side by side
upon a roomy, 4eep pld sofa, ;were evi-
dently' discussing some very, important
subject-impp#at atleast pethem-whei
the door bell tingled' away down in the
basement depths.
Then, surroundedbytheusualbodyguard
of echoes, came the step of a servant up
from those depths into the hall
The door was open.'
A pause, then the '4or of the parlor
was opened and a- stout-bodied narrow-
ishouldered servant entered and held out
his silver server.
Miss Deadttone took'the, card from it.
"Robert Glenha'm," she reati; thein
turned to Miss litinor- 'am so glad h(
has called,Twish youto seehim." To th(
servant-'I Show Mi.Glentham in."
Bowed the servant and 'retired. 'The
fn, a noieint' he re-enteiled annouiicini
with due formality and an additional bow
'Mr. Robrt Glenhan," and retired t
the depths again, his footsteps followed b,
the tireless'troupe of echoes.
"Goo4 morning,' Mr. Glenhain, T a
really happy tlit you have called so op
portunely."
"Why opporAinely, Miss DeadAtone i
queried Glenham, glancing at Miss Train
or, wlhon he recognized.
"So tat iay have the 'pleasure 4

And then the mere'formalityof intro-

"Don't mentn it, M.'Glenham. Come,

be obeyed the request, and then turning

she added in' a somewhat changed tone,
"unless one was in search -6f some partio-
ulat face;' some particular. person to thLe
exclusion of all else."
WYou were not thereon that mission
I trust I" said Glenham who had, noticed
the change in her tone, a faint suspicion,
crossing his mind that her werds might
have a deeper meaning.

mine," She changed the subject, "You are

taken at its true 'value.

GLENHAM MAKES A DISCOVERY ANP LOSES
HIS NERVE.
FOn the Moment Glenhailirea   nine

ed effigy of some dead-and-ggis Dedstone
hanging upon the wall in fr'oifer him.
Presently the silence was boleii bT
Iliss Trainor.
"This is a strange old 'housi, Mr. Olen.
ham," she said.
He started as if he had been suddenly
roused from a doze f sleep.
"'I beg-your pardon-4or my absent-i
niindedness biflreally-my thioghts de

" Wool-gathering," she silled-" I said
this is a'strange (old hotse."

Wherl I get into one of them somehow,

the long ago of my own life, pnd thfre
comes trooping  before my mental vision

known but ,wh9 ;haye passed away-'
Pshaw I Miss Trainor, this is-"
" Annoying, to, me  .Oh, no, Mr. Glen-
ham, I myself have had something of the
feeling to which iyou  llude, when at time
I have been left here alone-as now-in
this great, lofty, darl-waled parlor."
"put, pardoU me, Miss Trainor, you are
very young yet, ertainly too young to
have an unpleasant or regretful memot
of the,past. In Society, with its gaieties,
its brghtness,. animation, and with the
glamour of all its varied and ednstan-
ly increasing attractions surronn4ng yoi,
surely, your gast must have been one

Deadatonednaughingly! said, "you are al-
ways sure.of a welcome?,.".*
" And if yow, are. not at 'home t" said
Glenham, as he paused iithe threshold
of the. door.
" Ah I well, the de'6ee will welcome
you-since ou friendo'call this the House
of Echoes."'
With 6 bow to' -Miss Trainor, he tui-nfd
bnd was gone.'.                  '
That evening denham was to nfeet the
daughter of Jerome Duaal.
And as he walked slpwly awqy fropa the
Deadstone mansion a fear began gradu'
ally to come upqn him, that by some one,
or from some source, who or-what he knew
not, there was close at han4 a betrayal
of thereality of ,is life-an exposure of
his past life, and resulting in' his own
degradation.
He ha4 had onca or twice before the
Aame strange dread of evil to' come, asd
it had passed away. , Now it seemed
to come-gradually -gathring ,tronger,
darker-more awful in its portent.,
Who in all the .wide city could fathom
his secret
Who?    .
As he turned at the street crossig the
action brought him face to face with--one
whom he had seen once before, wlie hie
hand was stained with the blood of th
brother of Louise Trainor.
It was the young man with an old fce
high cheekbones, heavy mqustache, keex
gray eyes, and croppedbir-Joe Muddler
the bar-keeper of t4e corner drbin
saloon.
Joe was clad in theheight of bar-keepe
fashion, but the keen eyes had not for
gotten the man of whom he had sai
months ago, on that night-" I shan't foz
get his face."   ,
Therecognition wasmutual-yetteithc
betrayed by action his knowledge of th
other's individuality.
Glenham walked 'on, neither glancin
to the right nor left.,
The bar-keeper paused a moment aft(

Mn. JOE MvDPLEP h 'bar keeper, sallied
fqrth from the. hotel, with a suspicious
twinkle in his sharp eyes.
As if by the . twinkle he'  was' saying
to himself "MAh, ah I I don't knowmuch
about that fellow; but what I d6, knovi
is this: he's, apigeon to l:e plucked, and
Il keep my wbather- eye' onhim occi.
sionallyi Joe Muddlertshio fool, Joe Mud-
dler isn't. Either that fellow on thatnight
when ,he dropped into my bar with. the
blood upon his hand,.fresh blood, too, had
stithin"'to do' with that' murder in Pell
street or he Nadn';"
/ So he cogitated as he strolled' along, al-
most retracing Glenham's'walk from the
House of the Echoes.,
,  As he wanton his way with that pecu-
liar swagger which only anEast side Bowr-
ery bar-keeper can assume when he is in
"luck," he resolved othe matter 1 of Mt.
Glenham'slittle affair over and over again,
each time coming to the determination to
" git suthin' out of jit." b '

Glenham had passed on, then, as if datfs.
fied, continued hisway.
But Glenhami was troubled. He knew
the bar--keeper recognized -him; 'he felt
it-yet he endeavored to' cahin himself
with the belief that thit was the end of it.
Wasit?
If Glenhamn, vas -he ascended tghe steps
leading to thd grand entrance of his hotel,
had looked around, and quickly, he-would
have discovered the fact that Job Muddler,
the bar-keeper, had quietlyfollowed 'him
-." hived ". hirhi'
And If, after he "had 'seended to his
suite of rooms, he could have with his
vision seen through fldors and walls down
as faÂ± as the office cointei, le would'have
been regaled with the iight'of Mt Joe

or,to use his ownelegant aa compxehen-
si ve 'vernaculat, "on 'the make.  Iow
much he had "knocked down "'i4 his ser-
vice as lar-keeper fron his employers'
drawer was on6 of'those mysteries wtich
only bar-keepers can solve.
'He had, however, made enough, by some
occult process best knowito himself, to
array, himself in the flashy imitation of a
gentleman, tolnake a show offjewelry and
secure a position as thei bar-keeper if a
fashionable-Broadway skiboh.
But desplee6 this exaltation in' rank, he
had an ambition to get a little father
ahead in 'the "fast line" anid thbrefdre he
was not disposed to' lose sight' of any
chance by which he'might ~add l"ohis ac-
count. '
" There was suthi' strange about that'
fellow's actions when ,h came in thI
night with the'blood on his hand. He was
shabby; gone to seed. Hd~i't' been
saaved, I 0n"w  for weeks, nor had 'his
hair combed, I dont believe. He trembled
al over, an' it wasn't with cold, 'Llat'a

" Why, Joe, my brick, I thou bt you
had stepped out, gone; haven't seen you-
for an age."
Thus, encountering Joe, exclaimed Mr.
Moquard, that amiable gentleman who
has already introduced himself as a part
and parcel of, this veracious history.
Mr. Moquard was clad neatly, but ex
pensively.  Evidently he was not suffer-
ing for the want of funds.
When he addressed Joe tht indmvuai
looked up, recognized his acquainta ice,
held out his hand, struck anattitue, and
aid:
"Moke, put it there; shake. How are
yoU, old boy,"
"Fine-anywhere now I"
"Not the old place,, over in Bower"
"No; Broadway. But I say,      oke,

SGdt w     oker,I  you are a genius, you

how ?"
"Prospecling, Joe;,just ambling for the
benefit of my health. Suppose we walk
together, eh?"
This proposition suited Joe, and so the
precious pair sauntered on together.
'Joe was dealing within himself wheth-
er he 'should disclose to his friend and ex-
tremely honorable acquaintance, Mr Mo-
quard, his ideas concerning Glenham,
when tn their stroll they reached the cor-
ner of the block in which stood glowering
down uppn the street the grept broad-
fronted House of the REchoes.
Down the wide steps of that house at
that niomeut game Louise Trainor, her
friend, Letty Deadstone, above upon the.
threshold of the door bidding her a laugh-
ing good-bye and then disappearing.
Miss Trainor turned her steps toward
the corner from which Joe Muddler and
guard were sl0ly advancing,
- Absorbeain thought she dfd not notice
these indiv'Ualsuntil she, had almost
confronted them.
'Tepy were Dot more than a dozen steps
fro&amp;m  e corner. On the opposite side of,
the'stree~t the lower corner, an anciept

Celtic lady,' sitting behind a small apple
stapd. flis immense mind was wholly oc-
cugied in ,a strategic effort to obtain an
apple from the stand without the troyible
and expense9f havingto pay for it.
Miss T;lno s glance fell upon Joe
Muddler an Moquard.
The moment she beheld Moquard she
uttered an exclamation of surprise, end
for the instant; stq9d as if frozen tothe
spot.

ments at the great hotel - scheming, plan
ning, and plotting to gather in her prey.
Madame Moquard,, so far as, her ap-
quaintance:with Glenham was convergedt,
had no designs upon his pea ce find or
upon his money. She had rather a liking
for the grave, cynical, quiet man. There
was nothing in this liking akip to love,
and certainly nothing of passion, it was
simply a liking---a desire, to win 'his es,
teem, his friendship.
To her, pariah that she,was, the friend-
ship of one human being-4 friendship
that would be thoroughly useful, with no
admixture of the grosser, characteristic
which so often leaven that best of all hu-
manfeelings-would be a blessing, a source
of happiness,, she would -not readily cast
So, with what toppqrtuPity, offered in
the way of meeting Glenham, she did:4er
best to gain the prize,, and with her we..
man's tact, and the natural spq*uqenfe of
hotel life, yhere occasions oPe day or an-:
other for chance eagounters. are rarely
lacking, it is et strange that .she,, by-
andsby,. partially succeeded in her pur-
pose. -
When they Met st table, it came to pass
that they began to regard# .ealothUr as
old acquaintancess , neither, o Wever,
knowing or caring to inquire intothe pagt
life or-history oftheother.,.- I
Glenhad's past wAs as a volyqme which
he had sealed up and 14d, away from all
mo4aisight or thought, ni4as for madame
Moquard's, what eggd he for that? 3-Both
were willing to..acceptsthe present, gad
use it as wiely.for thir own purposes of
enjoyment 'and schemes as they could.
 Glenhanwith that aoutenesswhich had
grown upon him through the. bitteiZ ex.:
periences.of the past, readily understood
that she was a schemer, and that she too,
like~himself, was alone in the world,, and
working-to accomplish a hiddenpurpose-
some d4ep-lIaid speme,; but he also saw
that, init orwith ise did not seek to
Incjlidhim as one otfhey pnppets.
And, although he knew, it not, she read
hi mental page equally as clearly.

So, why should not this pair be what in
society ie called friends,?
And what more appropriate place for
the fonatjon or continuance of such
friegidsbip than a fashjonable hopel, which,
in itself, is, a social world-the duplicate
of the p!etences,,luxury, dress, and extra-
vagance of that mogstrqps sham, "our

"Can you-can you get me a carriage 'to

favor, at least.
"Why, Abel, my carriage is at the
cur b.. Tell me where you live, and I will
see you safely home. I hope you are not
badly hurt. Come, let me raise you up.
Once in my carriage, and then you can tell
me where your home is."
Then, turning to the crowd of lookers-
on, who were pressing closely upon him,
Glenham said:
"tand back-more room here."
The man opposite, to whom Glenham
had first -spoken, and who was still be-
side Abel, proffered his assistance in rais-
ing him from the pavement.
Carefully they lifted Abel to his feet,
and slowly led him, weak, trembling and
moaning; to the carriage.
So far as they knew, or as he feebly ex-
pressed himself,"there seemed to be no
fracture of his 'limbs; whatever injury
there might be was internal.
The crowd, as in duty bound,'followed
them, and pressed closely up to the car-
riage-door.
No policeman as yet had appeared.'
Everybody had an observation to make
and all sorts'of advice to give, and each
individual was positive'that if his advice
should be taken there Would be no further
trouble.
To all the suggestions and advice Glen-
ham made 'no reply.
He heard and saw only Abel.
A' mind was busy with the peril of
this unexpected discovery by Abel of his
identity, and of how he could, 'either to
secure the cashier's silence, in case 'he re-
covered from his injuries, whatever they
might be, or failing in that, how he 'could
best turn it otherwise to his advantage.
Once he had deposited Abel in the car-
riage he asked him Ins place of residence.
The cashier told him.
t was in one of the up-town cross
streets on the6eatside.

Gleiham entered the carriage. and was
driven off, leaving the crowd to slowly
disperse in search of some other sensation
around which it might gather, and waste
tine in the gratification of its morbid ap-
petite.'
CHAPTER XXX.
ABEL KRAMP'S LAST RIDE.
THE ride of Glenham'with the disabled
cashier was not a long one, and the car-
riage, in accordance with the direction
given the coachman, drew up at the place
indicated.
It was not a pleasant orcleanly ihorough-
fare in which Abel Kramp had'his abode;
it was one' of those arrow' unsavory
streets, lined on either side by tall tene-
ment-houses, with their narrow dark en-
.trances through which, :ut and in all day
long, careered ragged, dirty-faced, frowsy-
headed ,children, lean, hungry-looking
dogs, while slouchy women in drabbled
dresseslingered about the pavement in
little groups, gossiping over the-troubles
of the little wretched world, in which
poverty had thrown them.
, It was before one of these tall tenement-
hoses.that the carriage drew up.
The sight of such an equipage was a
rarity in that neighborhood-an ambu-
lance, a pie wagon, or a cheap hearse, with
its. dingy decorations and the necessary
cheap hack. followingit, were the most
expensive vehicles usually visiting the
locality.
Consequently the wopen -thereabout
ceased their, gossip, thep ragged .children
ceased their play and er9wded up toIsee
the iwpnted show of a private carriage
with a liveried driver.
Glenham was the firat te alight after
the coachman had openedthe door.
"On the third floo-third fluo, Mr.
Jaffray," saidAbel. " Tere, thae the en-

After a brief but.thorodigh examination,
and a few 'questions to Abel, which were
answered as well as he was able, Dr.
Pillule took out his book and' pencil and
wrote a prescription.

And now he had volunteered to watch
beside this man while death stood at his
elbow, not through any motives of kind-
ness, but simply to gather what infornia-
tion he could of the banker's later course
of life. Of all men in the world he knew
Abel Kramp could if he chose give him
this information.
CHAPTER XXXI.
"'OUT OF A DREAM INTO THE REALITY."
GLENHAM administered to Abel the
medicine in accordance with the direction
of the physician, and after a while the
cashier seemed to obtain an almost com-
plete respite from pain. He lay there calm,
quiet, and apparently little inclined to'
converse. He made no motion or attempt
to speak, save now and then to ask for
water.
By-and-by Glenham discovered that he
was sleeping as quietly as a child. The
breathing was regular, and his pulse beat
as evenly as if no physical derangement
had occurred.
Glenham, as the moments crept on, be-
gan to feel, in the silence and loneliness
of the dimly-lighted room, a drowsiness
creeping upon his senses, and, in that
half waking, half unconscious state, he ap-
peared'to have two separate conditions of
existence. He imagined himself to Le by
the bedside of Abel, and at the same time
sitting in one of the great shadowy parlors
of the House of Echoes, conversing witlA
Miss Trainor, talking to her of Abel
Kramp and his accident, and speak-
ing to Abel concerning Miss Trainor;
and amid this strange duplication of
himself and the confused jangle of
thought and incident there came a
shadow, and, preceded, followed, and
surrounded by troops of echoes at every
step, entered Jerome Duval, with the
thin, ghastly, death-stricken face, and
upon his arm leaned his daughter Edith,
she, too, deathly pale ; and both father
and daughter with their eyes fixed upon

him with terrible earnestness.,- Slowly
they moved towards him, andas they did
so Abel Kramp's presence intervened,
and then all faded, or seemed to fade, or
rather, dissolved into, another-a vast
graveyard, with a leaden-grey sky glow-
ering over it, while as faras the eye could
reach, row after row of graves stretched
away like the furrows and hillocks of a
newly-plowed field.I
Then again before him stood Jerome
Duval, withEdith, bending beside a grave,
sunken, overgrown with 'weeds, and un-
marked. Something, as if it were a whis
per borne to his- hearing upon the wind,
murmured in his ear, "Mary lies here-
Mary, the sister of Edith."
And out of this weird phantom of his,
drowse grew another, a wild, desolate sea-
beach, upon which the waves were dash-
ing up and wrestling together like bat-
tling monsters. The flash of a signal-gun
of distress lightened up the gloom around
him,, and in the instant of this terrible
illumination he beheld a vessel stranded
-upon a ledge of rocks, and upon her decks
what seemed a myriad of struggling hu-
man beings.
- Again the flash and the dull boom of
the gun, and, all the life upon the decks
was swept away, and upon the summit
of one vast wave, which seemed surging
toward him and almost overwhelming
him, he beheld two lifeless bodies-,horri-
,ble, ghastly forms. One more glance-the
faces of-the dead were turned toward him.
They were the faces of Edith Duval and
of the man whose body he robbed in the
Pell street basement.
With one mighty surge the great wave
which bore them up, as a, giant would
have held up a couple of children, hurled
them at his feet upon the beach.
The terror and fright of this distemper-
ed vision aroused him.
Abel Kramp's hand was grasping his
arm.
" Why-why -Mr. Jaffray-wlat is the
matter ? I have-I-have been trying to
rouse you." This much saidAbel, weakly,
but with scarcely any of the tremor in his

a

BETWEEN TI
voice, which marked his utterance in the
early part of the evening.
Glenham, with an -effort, arousedhim-
self, but the paleness, of his face and the
drops of perspiration told how much the
mental agony, the swift-chpnging phantas-
magoria of his brief drowse, had distress-
ed him. 1t was some moments before he
thoroughly regained his usual composure
-a composure, a control of his feelings
which, enabled, him to stolidly repress
every impulse or thought which might
divert him from the bitter task .to which
he was devoting his life-1evenge.
"1Abel," he said, "did I frigtten you?
I was tired-and the silence around me
irresistibly droye me ipto this drowse., I
must have slept. sound, had some ugly
dreams, too, if I.remember right. Well-
well!..Wh.y," looking at his watch, "past,
twelve; no wonder it, is so quiet around
hereit is time for, your medicine, Abel.
You seem much better: your sleep, at least,
has done.you, good,"  ,
.t I feel easier; not,;mich pain; butI
am weaker., While I slept, Mr. Jaffray-I
can call you by that name now that there
are none here to-.
"1Oh, certainly," said Glenham, as .,he
busied himself dropping the medicine into
a gloss.
"iWhile I. slept I dreamed my life
through, all its troubles, its hopes.- I
lived years in minutes. they say that
such a dream to the sick is a forerunner
of-of death."
"An idle. fancy," replied  Glenham.
"1Here, take this."
Abel raised himself partially and oey
ed, then fell back upon his pillow.
f" An idle fancy," repeated, Glenham,
" at least-" he paused, ganged at Abel
and toolj him by the hand which lay upon
his breast.
" Abel)" Glnat voice lowered and
despite his effort to-repress it, there was a
tremor in hi, utterance.
Abel's soittary eye glanced toward the
lamp. "Mr. Jaffray, turn up the lamp,
'make it lighter."
-Glenham arranged the lamp, placed it

HE CRIUSTS.                        7i
upon a little table by the bedside, and then
reseating himself, again took Abels hand
in his own. Now the solitary eye was
fixed upon him.
"Abel," he said, "I trust you will not
permit whatas about to say to you-":
Glenham remembered, as hie began, the
words' of Dr. Pillule  "i could do no
good should I cat again $bfore morning.
4fter tiiat you had better, as gently aspossi-
ble, bring him to a knowlege o] his true con-
dition."
Buthe also remembered that should he
wait until after the physician had called
it might be too late. Besides, siould,in
the erly morning, Duval 'learn of bia
cashier' condition, heImight be confront-
ed by the banker ,himself.
" Better,"argued Glenham, in the'selfish-
ness of his soul, bett r a lnhadred Abel
Kramps should die than such a meeting'
should occur.'
So it was, as he sat there, that he re-
solv'ed to reveal to Abel Krainp h)is true
condition.
"Abel, what i ani about io' say to you
is a sad revelation, which concerns you-"
he hesitated,. then began again. " The
doctor informed me that-"
The -solitary eye ,xed, upon him as
he spoke, and watched' the changes of
Glenham's e  iitenance and his hesi-
tancy. "Mr. 3Mfrayspeak it out. If the
doctor hais 'said I ani to die'of my hurts,
let me know it. I am firmer stuff than you
im-imnagine."
A "I am glad to hear it, Abel. I-the
doctor-"
"Says I can not recover, is that it "
There was not a tremor in the cashier's
voiae its l interrupted the hesitancy of
Glenhani.
"That i's is'assertion."
"Ho4-hew iong-1ow many days did

"So be it. God's will be. done!" said
Abel Kramp, There was a solemnity iiM"
hi' tone ililchli for the moment 'awed
Gienham.     *
"Mr.. Jaffray, I havesopie papers to irii
trust to you, which you will not receive
until after-afei I amn oit of the wo-Ad.
See! ' I, have,tfie keys-here,-open that
book-case, take, down from the second'
shelf tha' copy of Macaulay's'England."
Glenham took the keys.
" Now," tlioight he, 'is my tine."
He took the~volume from the shelf.
" Brig it here," said Abel.
Glenhapi handedO him the work, It was
in ordinary binding, somewhat worn.
"You will not' leave me until -until all
is over?" There was a tremulous* ex-
pression of anxiety in his tone.,
"You may be sure of that,' s'aid Glen-
ham.
"I am grateful. N ow," the cashier said
as he opened the book "do you 'se, as
I turn the pages," he turned them slowly,
but not leaf by'leaf, "that here and there
certain letters are underscored"by the
mark, lightly made, of a peiicilI"  .
As he spoke he p6tiitud out at random
on the different- pages a letter here and
there which wap sidesignated.
I see them,, said, Glenhamn, somewhat
puzzled as to what Macanilays History of
,England and these marked letter's had to
do with' the pagers to which the cashier
had alluded.
Abel Kramp closed the book and placed
it under his pillow.
When I am gone take the book away
with you. Then begin at the nineteenth
page, and by taking each letter as it occurs,
through, until you reach the thirty-ninth
page, you will find the direction' which
will place within your hands the papers
of which I have spoken. Read themi, and
act as yon see fit.' I-I will be beyond
all reach of whatever harm may occur
from their use."
Glenham saw that the period to Which
Dr. Pillule had referred in the 04Wndition
of his patient was at hand.
"He may seem to grow stronger."

Evidently Abel Kramp had . grown
strong. 'there were no more expres-
sions of pain.
His face was ealm, atid the solitary feye
as clear and bright, as the lamplight fell
upon it, as if the glaze of death were an
hundred years away.
Stronger! 'So auch so'that Glenham
began to feel that there was a chance of'
life, despite' Dr. Pillulel' assertions.,
But it did not deceive Abel.
He knew that death was near. He knew
that 'his present return of strength, and
the clearness of'his mental' faculties, were
but the last transient faash of the life-

Stronger! why he feit strong enough

CHAPTER XXXII.
LETTERS FROM AN OLD TRUNK AND
WHAT THEY DID.
qLEN.HAM looked at his watch. Tho
monients were slowly creeping on toward
the dawn.
He began to grow impatient. Perhaps
the eashjer's strength would fail before his
story was.finished.
But there was as yet no quiver in his
tone; he seemed rather to grow stronger,
and the solitary eye brighter and' more
expressive.
And as Glenham noted this he began
to wonder within himself if after all the
doctor might not have been mistaken in
hsrassertion.
This young girl came to, the banking-
house guite often-two or three times a
eek. Upon the occasion, of her first
visit t, nd that was when I saw her for
the fir t time, she inquired for Mr. Duval.
She was well clad, not expensively, but
neatly, as if she might, perhaps, be the
daughter ,of a tradesinan in comfortable
pircunstances. I. showed her into Du-
va}'s private office.

I scarcely dared trust myself-to speak to
her in the presence of the clerks about me,
as I conducted her to the private office.
I do not care to relate-how, within two or

stern stolidity, his grasping greed, hie

world a kindly heart, generous nature
and the goodness of the Christian. Nel'

seemed like coming out of the darknes
into the full glory of a paradise. Bu
then came darkness, the terrible darknes
which engulfs the soul and crushes ou
the light of hope, a darkness more awful
than that of death itself. One day-we ha
then been married four months-I cam
home rather earlier than usual. She ha
gone out, probably on some trivial shop
ping errand. I had a pass-key by which
could enter at all times. Into this ver
room I came. I busied myself a whil
in looking over some papers-bills, rc

',

ceipts,and memoranda. There wasia small
trunk in one corner of the room in which
Nellie--how Ihate the naamq-kept sundry
odds and ends of ribbons, lace, and a few
keepsakes and trinkets, which she said had
once belonged to her mother. Some evil
or good spirit, thought, or whatever you
may call the sudden feeling pf curiosity
which came upon me, prompted me to
notice that it was unlocked, the key re-
mainingin the lock, led me to raise the
lid, and with no more than the vague
idea of satisfying this curiosity to exam-
ino Ats contents. In one corner there
was a little pasteboard box, tied around
with half a dozen findings of tape and
securely tied.
" Twice I passed over the box, the last
time as I was about closing the lid, when
there came again that strange, irresistible
feeling of curiosity- a feeling foreign to
my nature-to open the box and - learn

CHAPTER XXXIV-
.JE9OME DUVAL IS SOMEWHAT TROUBLED.
Dr. Pillulo Was driven directly to the
residence of Jerome Dqval.
The eminent Christian and banker had
not yet arisen--so the servant who an-
swered the summons asserted.
"Hand him this qard," said the doctor.
"I must see him immediately-it is upon
a matter of importance."
The servant disappeared, leaving the
doctor waitipg upon the threshold of the
door.
Presently he returned.
"Mr. Duval will see you directly, sir,
please step this way)'
He conducted the doctor to the bank-
er's sitting room-the same in which, he
was sitting so comfortably long before on
that March evening when he read in the
afternoon papers of -he terrible death of
his daughter, Mary Jafftrar
In a few moments the banker, in morn.
ing gown and slippers, entered.
This is an early visit, doctor, but in
n0 wise connected with your professional
duties I trupf- 7
ePartly. I came to inform you that yes-

Kramp-"

"Abel Kramp dead!" exclaimed Du-

slowly, as if endeavoring to realize the
fact more surely as he spoke.
"Dead, sir. Some friend of his con-

and then watched beside him until he
died."
"Dead! dead !.. That is bad--very bad

1I was in the room but twice, and--"
began the doctor evasively.
"You thought only of your patient, I
presume, and did not-"
"My stay was brief at each visit.
And here- " the doctor drew forth the-
dead man's will- "is a will which he. re-
quested me to take charge of. I have
not read it nor.did he give me any clue to
its contents. I would rather you had
charge of it-my professional-labors you.
see-you understand?'"I
"Of course--ertainly," said .Duvalr
taking the will with an eagerness which
did -not escape the attention of, the doc-
tor; "I shall attend to its bequests as,
faithfully as if he had been my brother."
"You know the location of his apart-
Mets" queried the doctor-.
1" Most certainly, and of :all my em-
ployees."1
"You will of course take charge of his-
funeral obsequies?" .      .
brHesiall have as tender and respectful
burial."
"I shall notify the coroner. The in-
quest will doubtless -be brief-my own
statement with the information of the ac-
cident as given me by his friend will be-
all that is necessary to decide the -case.
Upon my certificate,"no autopsy will be
neded."criI     I of --     -
1"- The certificateof a physician of your
reputation will be sufficient to allay all
doubt."
The doctor 'bowed in deference to the
compliment.,
" I will order my carriage at once," said'
Duval, "and drive over to his apar-tments.
Is there any one now with him?"
".No. I locked the, room-here is the
key. Let an undertaker be summoned
after notifying the coroner. Should'my
-presence be required before teno'clook.I
-will be at my offce"
" Thank you, thank you," said Duval..
" This is dreadful, however. 'Itis -the-
first death among :my employees. since I
bave been in.,the,' banking business.
Really, doctor, it has shocked me, more
than perhaps you are aware of. I have a.

habit of restraining the expression of my
feelings; but surely this is one of those
accidents-one of those unexpected occur-'
rences which are 41 the more startling-
when-when-"           '
"There, Mr,,Duval, I understand what
you would say. It is distressing, but
must be borrie." .
It was vell the doctor interrupted him,
for the eminent Christian and banker in
his sudden anxiety to appear deeply af-
fected by the loss of his cashier, and to
conceal his real feeling in the matter, had
become muddled, and his usual calm self-
possession was somewhat weakened..
"Evidently," thought the doctor, "it
would take more'than one cashier's death
'to bring grief to this man's heart." But
he sd nothing.

proceeded to dress, with his usual scrupu-

Then' another subject jf .annoyance
came up.  "That friend, who had at-

last moments-what night not Abel
Kramp have divulged to him I Who was
this friend?1" ;Abel, so far as Duval knew,

On his way there were two points inIs

Ohe was td the identity of that' un-

The other was as to what revelations,

Throughout there was no mention or al-
lusion whatever to his recusant wife.
Duval discerning this felt relieved.
Knowing this, by his first quick glance
at its contents, he reperused it more
slowly, so as to thoroughly understand it
and its bequests, or rather bequest.

Louise Trainor was there, looking pale
and worn, yet with her whole mind,'en-
grossed with the absorbing, ruling idea-
the detection of the murderer of her
brother, or the clearing away of the mys-
tery which surrounded his disappearance.
Upon the day on which she had so sid-
denly face to face encountered Moquard,
and so signally failed in her endeavor to
secure his detention she formed' another
resolve.. She began to see how hopeless
it was to depend upon her own unaided
efforts, and she also began to feel that it
was wearing her away and in this ex-
haustion, mental and physical, destroying
her power to steadily continue the par-
suit.
She was alone in the world-save in so
far as her: motherwas concerned there
werenone in all the frivolous crowd with
whom her social position brought her in
contact upon either whose friendship or
confidence she couldirely.save-I----A' "
To her mother of late she had avoided
all reference to the matter; for She was
feeble, and any further mental excitement
than that she had alreadyborne in mourn-
ing over the loss of her son, whose life -had
been the g16ry of her existence. might
bring.upon her a mortal illness.
To the mother, her mind weakened by
het bodily ailments, the past was fast be-
coming a -mere dream. To her daughter-
she now looked for consolation and.solace
-and. Louise knowing- this, took care,'
with:'all tenderness and love, to obtrude
upon her nothing which would revive' all
the sorrow and anguish of that deaO'
past.
But as for herself, she had not forgotten
the words she had uttered to Jeroni Du-
val, at.the outset of her search:
" Henceforth there is no rest for me n-
til my brother's death is revenged by
bringing to. justice: the man' who 'was his
slayer.   Would give all-,+yess
even my own life' for a, clue which will
lead me out of this dark mystery.".
Sincethei she .had'once again, as she
thdight, stood fice to face with that man;i
he was almostwithin her reach and yet

81

again he eluded her and was gone. In
all the- great city, so guarded and pro-
tected by the police, that man still roamed
at large, despite her endeavors, her weary
round of search I
Was it not terrible, this awful blank of
hopelessness which began to close in upon
herl
But she knew no such word as despair.
A new resolve had come upon her.
Once more slie had determined to employ
the agency of a detective.
The detective sat opposite her in that
great dimly-lighted room, into and out of
which the haunting echoes had so often
troops&amp;; sat there,,saying little but listen.
ing to her relation of all her search, and
of the circumstances attending it.
He was an easy, nonchalant seeming sort
of.person, with not at all bright eyes or any
facial expression of aptitude for his busi-
'ness. He rather would have been taken
by the ordinary observer for a sort of man
about town, bla$4 to anything in the
way of.excitement; a man of imperturba-
ble good nature,.not gifted with any no-
ticeable mental qualities, and one whose
social position.might-be high or might be
low. Neatly clad in the prevailing fash-
ion, in the prime of life, that is to say, not
.over forty, with a carefully trimmed mous-
tache, Mr. ,Tohn Trueman sat there with
iso little outwar4,expression of interest in
the subject that eyen Mios Trainor almost
doubted him,
'He was attached to a "Private,' Inde-
pendent Detective Bureau,' and was con-
sidered one of its most efficient officials,
and generally had'given him charge or the
working up of cases 'which other detect-
ives had abandoned-ashopeless. le had
not always heed1 successful in his under-
takings, but he had achieved enough in
his profession to bring him a large and,
indeed, an honorable reputation. He'nev-
er hadbeen: attached to the police force;
he had a natural aptitude for the business,
but never fancied -that restraint upon his
movements to which a regular official ia
obliged to submit.

" On the fifth of March you say he land-
ed here ? inquired the detective.
" Yes."
"And on the fifth day of March a perso'
giving the name of Robert Trainor called
at the banking-house of Jerome Duval and
deposited that large amount of money, at,
say noontimeI "
"At eleven o'clock, according to Mr.
Duval," stated Miss Trainor.
" Yes, and he presented the letters of
introduction from Messrs. Bullion, Bond &amp;
Co., of London 4
" Precisely."
"Miss Trainor," said Mr Trueman,
stroking his chin reflectively, and speak-
Ing as calmly and slowly as if the whole
affair and his narration of it were a mat-
ter of no particular moment, "I see noth-
ing uncommon in this disappearance."
" Nothing  uncommon!"    exclaimed.
Louise Trainor.
" There are a hundred a year of- such
disappearances which come to our knowl-
edge, and the knowledge of the police.
In a city like this such things must be-
such things have to be among al the
other happenings. The only wonder, is
that there are not more of them."
"But, sir-."
"One moment, Miss. Excuse me," said
the apparently argumentative and disin-
terested Mr. Trueman.  "They're good
cases to work up sometimes. This one is
not very clear at the start. Now you see
you ain't sure but that your brother, Rob-
ert Trainor, was made away with in Lon-.
don, and that some one else, crossed the1
water with his baggage and -under his
name. No one on this side who knew
him has seen him so far as you or I know.
But I'll. start upon the theory that he
himself did actually land here.  Now
when you found he had come ashore and
had not, after twenty-four hours' search
and waiting put in an appearance,: you
ought to have come to us at once. Our'
chances would have been ten to one of
succeeding. Now they are only one to
ten that we fail."
" Fail! Do not say that!"

I

BETWEEN T

"My theory is this--providing he did
land here, and that is the theory on which
I will work up the case-that the man
who first called at the banking house was
your brother; that the next who' came
was one of the parties who had a hand in
his disappearance. You saw him during
your visit there-this map 7"1
" As plainly as I now see you."
"And you are positive that this man
whom you saw in the street a little while
ago was that man ?',
".As surely as I would have recognized
my own face in the glass I recognized
him."
" You see, Miss, this matter of identity
is not always a certainty. Besides,. if you
had had this man arrested when younet
him in the street you could hive done
nothing with him as the case now stands.
Mere suspicion without some proof to
back it won't do."-:
" From my description of him will you
be able to recognize'him."     . .
" That depends. My business is to hear
nothing, see nothing, know nothing, and
remember nothing, yet to hear every-
thing, see. everything, know everything
and: remember everything."     .
" Is there any hope.do you think"n-
" That is not for me to say, now. If
there was no hope in me I wouldn't un-
dertake the case.. - Hopei Miss Trainor, is
like a, good breakfast-it's an excellent
foundation for a good dAy's work... I.will
'try to get .through this puzzle,,after. my
own fashion. . You must have patience
and let me have my own time." If I fail
it will be nobody's fault-if there is any
fault in failure-but mine. ,Now, where
*shall I commtmicate with you at any or
il tines-at.your house or here?"
" At my own residence.".
Aft3r . but little further , conversation
Mr. Trueman took his leave, and left Miss
Trainer alone in the great roomaind not
I:entirely well satisfied with the detective's
manner.
"What cares he," she thought, "whe-
ther he succeeds or fails ;'be is .paid the
saihe. There's no more. feeling in the

I

man than there is in a finger-post. He'll
never unravel the mystery-never-never!
Only in the great hereafter will I know
the fate of poor Robert."
Quite different were the cogitations of
Mr. John Trueman as he sauntered away
from the house towards Broadway.
" These women are the most unreason-
able beings. They have no faith in pa-
tience. It's their nature to worry and
have their own way, 'specially if it hap-
pens to be the wrong way of something
they don't know anything about. They
can't wait. I'd rather deal with a dozen
men than'one woman in a matter of busi-
ness. It's my opinion-never mind. I'll
work this job up as best I can in my own
light, but it is a slim, a mighty slim
chance."
So musing as he went along, he came
to the noisy thoroughfare, paused a mo-
ment at the corner, as if undecided which
conise to take, up or down.
"Last March, ehI and now it's getting
into the fall. I shan't go to Duval's bank.
There's no. information to be obtained
there. Ill go to the office and think it
over."
So he did. At the office, seating himself
quietly and lighting a cigar, he proceeded
to arrange the information he had receiv-
ed from Miss Trainor, in what he called
"systematic working order."
Presently he took from the large table
in the centre of the office, a file of daily
papers.
"Only back to July,"' he said. "I11 go
to-the Herald office. I'll begin there. I'll
see in the March issues the reports of
coroners' cases-the found drowned, the
knocked on the head, and other little ac-
cidents of that nonth. There's nothing
like beginning with a good start. If that
Robert- Trainor, landed here he's been
hocussed, robbed, and made away with.
There is always a clue to eyery riddle-
the only trouble is to find it. A very
small key sometimes opens a very large
door. Let me see-ah-that burglary case.
I'll step over and see about that, and then
I'll take in the Herald on my way."

HE CRUSTS.                        83
It had been scarcely two hours'since he
had left Miss Trainor, yet just as be threw
away the remains of his cigar and was
preparing to leave the office, a messenger
entered, bearing a note to his address.
He opened it deliberately- he did no-
thing hastily. He read simply these lines:
" Mr. TRUEMAN-In relating to you the
circumstances connected with my bro-
ther's disappearance, I omitted mention-
ing onething to you which, perhaps, may
be of value. He wrote me from London
that he hnad purchased a ticket in the
Havana Lottery, which ticket he may
have had with him when he landed. The
drawing of the lottery may not have oc-
curred until March. This information
may be of some use to you.   L
"Yours,        L. T.11
"Much use that is, but it may be. A man
in my business shouldn't despise anything,
except an empty pocket."
He folded the note, placed it in his
pocket, and left the office .
Mr. Detective Trueman had in this in-
terval formed his plan of action in this
special business of tracing out the fate of
Robert Trainor. It was his nature to be
obstinate in his adherence to whatever
theory he formed, and, to use his own ex-
pression, "nothing short of an earthquake
would move him " from it. To his credit,
however, be it said, his conclusions were
never arrived at hastily, and his judgment
only made after careful and deliberate in-
vestigation of a case or "job'" in all its
bearings.
He was one of those beings whose real
character and calibre of intellect women
find it hard, acute as they are, to under-
stand.  Therefore it was that Louise
Trainer, juaging him merely by super-
ficial oboervation and by his, apparent
stolidity of manner, distrusted his ability
even though she felt impelled by some
unaccountable impulse to yield him her
confidence.
When he left her presence shesat there
brooding over this one grief, that had
coine like a dark and evil shadow upon
her life, and under the influence of which
her mothlet too surely was gradually fad-
ing from her sight.

She had hoped and prayed that every
day of her search, of her wearying endea-
vor might bring her some faint encourage-
ment; but as each day and each week had
come, only disappointment confronted
her. Now that she had resolved to leave
the work to the detective, Trueman, and
for the time, at least, to await with what
patience and hope she could, the, result of
his services, even this relief did not
bring her the mental rest she so much
needed.
For the sake of the dear memory of her
lost brother, and of all Is tenderness to
her front their school-days up to the hour
when he left his farewell kiss upon her
cheek, she had striven to' solve this mys-
tery, and yet-
From her brooding thought she was
aroused by the opening of the door.
A servant entered, leaving the body-,
guard of echoes to die away in the outer
hall.
" Miss Deadstone would like you, maam,
to come up to her room-her bud-wor, if
you please, ma'am.",
And with a bow' the minion of the
Deadstone mansion, withdrew, satisfied
that he had as gracefully as usual accom-
plished one of the most important,func-
tions of his position,
Louise 'Trainor ascended the broad
staircase and entered the apartment which
Miss Letty Deadstone occupied as her
boudoir.
Is it all arranged with the officer?"
asked Letty. -"Im so glad. Now that
you have it partially off your mind, come
iit down and let us have a cozy chat; it
ill cheer you up, Lohi. I'm afraid I will
have to keep you hete awhile unless you
become a little more like the Louise
Thinor of last year. By the way, I've
got a bit of gossip for you. Of course you
know the Rev. Mr. Pawridge ?" I
"I do. What of him, Letty?"
"Well, it's a great deal of. him, and if
the rumor are true, it's not much to his
credit."

CHAPTER XXXVI.
THE NEW READING OF- THE ENGLISH
HISTORY, AS FOUND BY GLENHAMS
GLENHAM slowly deciphered the enigma.
It was certainly a task requiring patience
if not labor. As he came to the under-
scored letters he transcribed them one
after another upon a sheet of paper, so
that at the expiration of two hours he
completed his task.
"At last ! he said, and gave a sigh of
relief as he laid the book aside upon the
table and read the result of the' dead man's
bequest.-
Thus, line for line, ran tlie solution of
those marked letters, from page 19 to
page 39 of "Macaulay's Hist:ory of Eng-
land"-a new reading, and one which per-
haps never before had been exacted from
a history:

with which the lawyer concluded his
examination and looked up at Glenham.
"Mr. Kramp is dead1!,
"Dead! Why, I saw hin yesterday
morning," said the attorney. " Heart-
disease, eh I Take a seat."
" No sir," said Glenham, taking a seat
immediately opposite the lawyer. He then
narrated as briefly as possible the circum-
stances attending the cashier's death.
"Somewhat singular12" said Mr. Drill,
dropping the solitary glass from his eye,"
fortunate for him he met you. You say
you gave the will to Dr. Pillule?"
"1I did, but I question, little as I under-
stand the law, if the will will be of much
value, drawn as it is without witnesses,
and-"'
" Abel Kramp knew what he was about
-see 1" Rising, Mr. Drill brought from
his safe a folded document. "Here is a
will, of which the one you found was a
copy. This is the original duly signed,
sealed, attesited,.and as perfectly legal as
I could make it."t
"I am glad of it," said Glenham. "Pray
inform me who is this Mr. Rogerg-the
legatee -or rather, not so particularly
who is he; but where is he to be found
-his residence, I mean 1"1
"I will give it you presently, I have
here in this sealed package some papers
which are in the handwriting of Mr.
Kramp and which you can take with you
and peruse at your leisure. Among them
are a few letters whichv.it would be well
not to leave lying about outside of lock
and key. As I understand them, they are
not complimentary to the reputation of a
certain banker in this city.  However,
you probably will have but little interest
in their contents and can burn them up.
They are the relics of a great sorrow which
befel Mr. Kramp." As the lawyer uttered
the last sentence, a softened look came
upon his hard legal face and the gruff
voice mellowed. "A great sorrow, sir,
which he bore like a man."
At this moment the thin-faced youth
entered.
" WellI" said Ur. Drill, his face at once

regaining its usual office hardness and his
voice rising to its regular height of gruff-
ness. "Well "   -
"Mr. John Trueman wishes to see you,"
said the youth.
"Let him in." Exit the boy and im-
mediately enter Mr. John Trueman-as
non-committal of face, as nonchalant of
manner, and careless of gait as if he were
merely an animated mechanical contriv-
ance that needed winding up.
"Be seated, Mr. Trueman.".
Trueman complied with the request. As
he did so Glenham arose. -,
" Mr. Glenham," said the lawyer-
"should you desire to have an interview
in reference to this-this-matter-and I
presume it will be necessary you should,
suppose I name-the day after to-morrow
at three. Will that interfere, sir, with
any prior engagement of yours?'I
"Not at all. Here, I presumeI "
"Of course, here; I will make it -yes,
say three o'clock sharp."
Trueman was apparently absorbed in
the contents of a bulky calf-bound digest
which he had taken from the table.
"I shall be obliged to you," replied
Glenham, politely, and without more ado
passed out and was gone from their pres-,
ence.
"A fine looking man," said Trueman,
replacing the book upon the table$ " a
man of leisure--eh I"
"I know nothing of him other than that
be came here to-to facilitate the trans-
action of some business-"
*1I think I have met him before -on the

"No doubt, no 'doubt," said Mr. Drill,
betraying a slight impatience in his tone.
Of all things he' detested being cross-
examined, especially by Mr. 'Trueman's
covert inuendoes, which he was sharp
enough to know were uttered only for the
purpose of drawing him out. After a
moment's pause he added-" Anything

"Precisely what I came- to see you
about," replied Trueman. "I've hived

CHAPTER XXXVII.
MR. cLtrITCH:tT FALLS DOWN STAIRS BY
GETTING TO HIGH.
Mn. CLUTOIT as a detective proved a
failure. Mrs. Pawridge found him after
an extended trial to be a gay deceiver.
Somehow he was unfaithful to his trust.
She discovered that he was incompetent
to detect anything except the presence
and quality of whiskey and other exhilar-
ating alcoholic compounds. So one day
she gave him a, peremptory dismissal.
Whereupon he returned'once nibre to
the shelter and permanent conifort of
" Gringo," where he might if he chosh be
independent ,and get continuously drunk
without question.
Madame GriiGgo no "more, for his wife
had given up the astsological business as
being inco patible with profit. It did
not pay.
She had removed from Carmine street
to other"ani loftier quarters.

ents, after losing rs..Pawridge's patron-

The Clutchits now occupied the third
floor in a tenement house in oue of the
cross streets on the east"side of the Bow-
ery. They had been there three months.'
One evening Mrs. Clutchit was in her
kitchen, kneading dough in a cracked
wooden tray.
Her calico dress sleeves were rolled up,
displaying a pair of arms gooselleshy as.
to texture, red as to color, and variegated
by dough and Bour.

flat breasted, and her astrological mouth
seemed to have pushed her ears back and
absorbed a portion of her upper lip. Mrs.
Clutchit was evidently fading. 6nly in'
her temper remained the vigor of youth.
Mrs. Clutchit rolled up her last batch
of dough, put it into the bread pan,
scraped the sticky bits and loose flour
from her goosey arms with her fingers,
and looked up at a two-dollar clock which
stood -amid a crowd of bottles, cups,
and broken plaster ornaments upon the
mantel-shelf above the stove.
"Nine o clock and that man not home
yet. Saturday night, too, when he knows
I'm out of money. Ugh ! the brute !"
She listened.  Evidently a familiar
sound struck her ear.
"That's him in' the lower hall. Drunk,
I'll be bound. No supper for him this
night."
She opened the door; stepped out into
the passage and stood at the head of the
stairs which were'only feebly lighted by
kerosene lamp hanging from the ceiling.
"9That's Clutchit,'t she muttered.
It was Clutchit, fearfully demoralized.
Clutchit was full, bt his bottle-mouth
was uncorked and he was grumbling all
the way.
He paused at the foot of the stairs with
his foot on the lower rail !while h is body
swayed about and lurched like a water-
logged ship in a heavy sea-.
"He kin git up if he kin," said Mrs.
Clutchit, viewing the spectacle and then

fully banging the door shut. !
" Sheems t'me," murmured Clutohit
idiotically arguing with himself, "Sheoxis

braced up, against the wall, and lcered
stupidly around. "Lemme she-thought

' Then he swayed and'rolled and lurched
around the bannisters, and fooled' along

the head of the lower flight.
" Thought sho-down there't Where"'I

And he stralihtened u p, then suddenlY

little bala'nee he had, and' yitniged head
and heels, tumbling, squelching, and

Doors were flung open, and the tenAnts
came rushing out.
They looked over the railing, 'saw
the dim light What and who it was, then
went back again.
" It's only that Clutchit with a load
on."
'Clutchit's drunk again."
"D-n that Clutehit."
That's what they said, and every one
of them -repeated the same to somebody
else inside.
Mrs. Clutchit went down toi the foot
of tlie stairs, where the tail of her house-

door.
"There, you beast now 'git-right up,
and gitup ,stairs, if you kin."
The fall had sobeied him a little, only a
very little.
He gathered  himself up after five
minutes of scratching and clawing about
the floor and' stood proudly balanced for
about two seconds. Then he made a
fresh start, lurched head down, took a

sudden and unceremonious whirl, and
bounce like a 'boulder fidm a catapult
up against and opposite door.
Whang flew open the 'door, and Mr.
Clutchit pitched into the room and went
down with a squelch. Then came terrific
yells. Two old maids were in that room,
and at that precise moment.one of them
was standing close to the door, listening
to the row outside, while the other had
her ee to the keyhole.
Resur-When that door burst open one
old maid was knocked endwise up against
a waspstand* and went 4lwn with it and
a pitcher full of water all pver her, and
the  other was flattened  out, with

And presently thy had' Oufift'up

him into the kitchen.
When they let go of him he dropped
with a grunt to the floor. The men went

out and left him alone in his glory with
his wife.
Thenshe saw that the patent tin collar
which he wore had bent up, and one of
the Bytonic corners 'had slit a gash uP-
under his chin, and the tin bosom attach-
ment had sprung out 'and was twisted 'so
that it 'looked, with the paint sciatehed
off anud a 'wet quid of tobacco flattened
against it, like a piece of'roofing.
He had not only dropped on the floor,
but into a s6lid sleep, and began to snore
then and there. Mrs. Clutchit jammed her
hands 'iMto 'his pockets , and began: a
general search. 'She drew forth an ageno
pamphlet full of pictorial tin collars of all
fashions, a lot of business cards, and his
pocketbook.  In that she found a liank
cheque for twenty dollars, -and three or
tour dollars in money. The cheque and
money she froze to at once-and put the
pocketbook back into his pocket.
There, now, lay 'there !  Ill'go to

butcher. Of all household ogres theI
butcher is the most implacable in the'
way ofextending credit or of observing
those little amenities of short change
which customers so much admire and de-
light to receive.
Her butcher was an exception-one of
those hearty, confidential individuals,
who if a piece of meat cost forty cents and
the customer had only thirty-five cents
would take it, pleasantly remarking, "All
right-never mind-you can owe me the
fivepence."
If anything yields exquisite delight to
the average market customer it isthe
financial favor of being trusted for five
cents which the butcher as. well as her-
self knows she will never pay, and 4oes
not mean to pay.
Of her butcher she purchased what meat
she required, and then tendered him the
cheque.
"I owe you four dollars, and can you
give me the balance in-in money I , It
is all Mr. Clutchit brought home with
him."
The butcher knew her. She had been a
long time customer of his, had always
been fairly honorable in her dealings,
and so, after a moment's hesitation and
inspection of the signature and cheque
generally, he complied with her request.,
The cheque was signed by Robert
Gleiham, and drawn to the order of St.
Leon.
This business being translated Mrs.
Clutchit slowly, with her heavily laden
basket, proceededhomeward. As she loft
the stall she did not observe that stand-
ing beside her during her colloquy with
the butcher was a quiet, unobservant in-
dividual who to all appearances'seemed
to be lounging ut merelyfor the pur-
pose of killing tfiue.
When she passed the cheque to the
butcher the lounger was employed in
examining a shoulder of mutton, punch-
Ing it with his fingers, and turning it over
in a desultory manner; and in doing it
seemed to be partially absorbed in some

sort of.a mental calculation as to what It
might weigh, and its probable cost.
'After Mrs. Clutchit-Grngo had dia-
appeared, the quiet individual abandoned
contemplation of the shoulder of mutton
and paid his respects to tie butcher,
"Isn't that risky   business, taking
cheques from parties-eh
"Parties!" said the butcher, good-
humoredly. "Oh! no, not'when I knok
'em. It aint women who buys meat in
dribs like that come the swindle, you
know; now that woman, I've knowed her
a couple of years. She used to be an as-
trologist, sort of fortune teller. Now she
isn't M thatline, bift she always pays. I
s'pose that cheque she got from her hus-
band, Clutchit.  He don't amount to
much, I don't think. One of thein fellows
tbat's always doing something and never
making much at it. Shiftless, slip and go
easy, Jack of all trades. It's all right as
long as she says so."
" Supposing he had offered it, ei ?"
"Well I'd have taken it all the same.
She'd fx it right if he'didn't."
i I suppose so," replied the individual,
"but you'll excuse me. I have odd ideas
about this cheque busmiess."
"One has to be careful you know," in-
terupted the butcher,  abiittiint much
difference after all. If we don't loge oie
way we will another, and a body don't
add to their loss by being civil and oblig-
Ig.- At least I never did. Now this
cheque,"f here he took it out ofhis greasy
drawer, and. held it up in his greasy
fingers. "I don't know whether it's good
or not, bint it looks good, and coming front
Mrs. Clutchit' I ve 'faith that it is good;
d'yer see I
"Certainly.  Yes.   Faith is a good
horse." As the butcher held it up the
individual merely glanced 'atIt carelessry,
but in that careless glance his eye had
caught the names upon it, the' auiouft
and the name of the bank upon which it
was dawn.
Evidently he was'satisfied.
"I think as  return I will stop, if it
isn't too late, and order that shoulder of

mutton," said the individual, turning I
"Any time. Saturday nights we're
open till eleven."           '
The individual slowly moved on, and
edged his way though the crowd. "One
more score against this St. Leon," he said
to himself, "and, as sure as my name is
Jack Trueman I'll find another beforeI
Monday night. Robert Glenham- well II
can find him easily enough. I think Sun-
day is a lucky day for fishing; I'll fish for
Clutchit."
At the entrance to the market he caught
sight of Mrs. Clutchit.'
"Fishing is unnecessary," he thought
as he saw her. "' Here is the fish, I'll fol-
low her, and that 'I1 save trouble.
And so he did.
To the door of the tenement house.
Then he went on, ligL iing a cigar by the'
way, and strolled up townwards.
CHAPTER XXXVIII.
GATHERING UP THE THREADs.
Fpom Lawyer Drills presence and office
Glenham returned to his hotel.,
Once there'and in his rooms he broke
open the sealed package and began an
examination of its contents. There were
various papers, all of them  in Abel
Kramp's handwriting.
The largest comprised three or foui
pages of foolscap, closely written, and
composed more in the desultory, broken
form of a diary than a straightforward
statement; more as if it bad been written
from time to time.
Carefully Glenham read it, and to say
that, despite his expectation that there
would be some strange revelation in the
contents of the mysterious package so
singularly brought int ohis possession, he
was astonished, would but feebly express
his feeling.
He almost leaped from his seat.
\The expression of amazement gave way
to one of exultation. His face lighted up,
his eyes flashed with a' gleam, as of
triumph.
"At last!" he said, half aloud, "at

last, Jerome 'Duval, I can stand face to
face with you, and defy the chance of rec-
ognition.. With this knowledge, traced
by a hand 'now as cold and pulseless in
deith as" your 'heart is to all feeling of
compassion or honor-with this knowledge
in my possession, I no longer fear what-
ever danger may come to him who claims
the name of George Jaffray."    Again
and again Gilenham read the manuscript,
and, as at length satisfied that he thor-
ougbly understood its meaning, every
word and line of it, he folded it, with the
rest of the papers, and deposited them
securely in an inner pocket.
"God help me, poor dead wife ! Your
sorrows, your terrible death, and all the
anguish, misery, insult, which this man,
this father has brought upon us, must
soon be atoned for. The hand of fate
must be in this-no human sagacity, no
human foresight could have so surely led
me, scheme and plan as I might, to the
consummation. of my sole wish. Ah !
Abel Kramp-deformed, wronged, yet
faithful, forgiving, but never f6rgetting-
from out of his lonely grave'reaches forth
to make clear the way. All is ready. It
remains but fo 'me to strike the blow.
One breath from me and the vain, haughty
money-god will tremble like a whipped
cur, and his house of cards topple to
pieces. And Edith-"
Yes, Glenham, Edith-must she, too,
suffer?
The thought of the fair young girl, so
innocent, so trusting, made him pause.
The sister of his dead wife, should she,
too, have her future life darkened by
himI
Steeled as he was against her father,
the remembrance of Edith's gentle, con-
fiding -nattire, of her purity, for the mo-
ment calmed him.
But it was for a inoient only.
Again the spirit of bitterness came upon
him, and he almost cursed the weakness
that had threatened even foi so brief a
period to make him forget, or half repent,
the unalterable resolve to which he had
devoted his life.

The Pell street den, with all its horror,
arose before his mental vision, and he
was a man, with the heart of :a demon.
At times, when the recollection of all that
he had suffered from poverty and want,
and of the unrelenting cruelty, heartless-
ness with-which Jerome Puvalhad driven,
him, by one device and another, frop an
honorable position in. society, and de-
stroyed his happiness, only because he
could not separate him from the woman
he loved-is it any wonder that his pas-
sion for revenge became the implacable
master of his life ?7. That it at times ob-
literated every wholesome thought and
all the finer feelings of his nature, and
crushed out the yearnings for the calm
and quiet of a purer life, was an inevitable,
conseqyence.I
Now, with this key to Jeroie Duval's
social destruction in his grasp, he became
defiant. There was none of the terror
now that before bad bee  evoked at the
bare thought of his identity with George
Jaifray, and he could mastereill obstacles.
From out of the gloom and mists of
doubt, the spectres of the 4ead beckoned
him into the light and clearness of cer-
tainty.
As he descended the broad staircase of
the liotel, he felt that once again be could
at will stand before the world-confront
all the city-as George Jaffray.
And as for Edith Duval- again the fair
vision was before him.
" She shall be mine! - God will govern
what else 'may betide afterwards.'
T[hen came the thought of others - the
recollection of his interview with Louise
Trainer in the .House of the Echoes, his
knowledge of the fate of her brother, and
as he remembered it he half resolved, in
his exultant defiance of consequences, to
reveal the secret to her.
What harm could come to him now I
But the robbery of the dead man!
It will not be forgotten by the reader
that Jaffray left upon the body'of the vic-
tim  of the midnight ruffians his gold
watch and diamond pin, and that when
the body was discovered in the morning

:i

by the police, both watch and dianmnd
were gone, and the body stripped of its
clothing.
Of that desecration of the dead he wa'
guiltless; even he had not robbed the
dead, for when he 'took possession of the
pocket-book, money, carte de visife, and
papers, the man was still breathing_; and
when he rushed forth into the night and
and storm aind sped away, the slow ebb
and flow of the'helpless form lying in the
noisome den still gave t6ken of the pres-
ence of life.
Of this robbery he neel not inform her,
he, argued. Then Came"Close upon this
the forecast of what would be the inevi-
table sequence of his betriyal. Louise
Trainer would, in her search fdr alt the
circumstances attending the catastrophe,
discover tfie fact that her brother had
been left there to die; that tle had bdeen
plundered, murdered, his body despoiled
of everything; n4 to her question, Who
did this? 'What coukl he; George Jaffray
alias Robert Glenham, answer ? Denial
would'not answer her; for denial, with no
other evidencethan his partial confession,
would be regarded by her as an attempt
to screen .himself, and that would b'e-
worse than all.,
. While he thought of all this, while he.
was bewildering his mind with this, he
little dreamed that Mr. John 'Trueman, in
his nethodical way, was searchingfor and
gathering together the threads of a fate
which would unravel to the mourning
sister of the lost man the dread mystery,
and lay it openin all its hideousness.
Pursuant 'to. his plan, 'John Trueman
had examined a file of the Herald.
Carefully he scanned the local reports
of the accidents, inrders,'sidden deaths,
and mysterious disAppearinces recorded
in the columns of that paper day by day
through the month of March.
There' was only one report of all which
attracted his attention.
This he read and re-read.
It was in the paper dated Mai'ch 7th,
1855.
"March the seventh, eh9?" he mused.

" This Robert Trainor arrived here, ac-
cording to his sister's statement, on March
the fifth. Um ! On that day he or the
man who personated him visited Duval's
banking-house, Now, if he was hocussed
and knocked on the head, or made away
with in any manner,,it must have been
on .the night of, that day.. Let me see-
here is the only mysterious affair which
occurred on the night of the fifth; that
was discovered by the police on the morn-
ing of the sixth, and of course the account
,of it is here in the Herald of the -seventh.
It was. in the, afternoon papers, I s'pose,
too-the afternoon of the sixth."    ,
John Txuemian,.in order to brighten his
thoughtsand possibly quicken his judg-
ment, solaced himself with a quid.of fibe-
cut, andthen continued his consideration
of the reporters work. . " ,     ,
It was almost verbatim the.samestate-
ment, with, .perhaps, a few additional
particulars, thb reading of -which a month
after the ;occurrence had so. terribly af-
fected Jerome Daval in his sitting-room,
aid which had; brought for the first time
to, Edith Duval the knowledge . of the,
miserable death of -her' sister Mary-the
,wife of George Jaffray.
"Coroner Settem held the inquest, in
this case, ehI Well I don't see how this'
affair can concernthis Trainer business.
This is  a starvation .case in a cellar-it
isn't likely, so nevermind; I'll see Settem
in a day or two, and have a chat with
him-I may pick up 'a little useful, infor-,
iration of some sort by it."-
Coroner Settem.
It was to this official that Jerome Da-
-val was driven in ,is carriage at the In-
stance of Dr. Pillale, during which mem-
orable drive he read the copy of the will
'ot Abel Kranrp.,

The coroner's inquest was a mere mat-
ter of form; how could it! be otherwise
whin such an eminent and highly influen-
tialcitizen as Jerome Duval suggested it
to a-complaisant city- offiial so open to
A material . arguments -as Coroner Set'
tei 7, There was nothing in it--merely a
jury summoned-the verdict--,-" accidental
death," and a cheap funeral next day at
the expense of Duval anotherr lonely un-
marked grave in- the' public ground of
Greenwood cemetery..
Whatever there were of the dead casb-
ier's effects ;in . the way of books, papers,
and memoranda, with some few of the
more choice articles of vertu Mi his rooms,
Duval caused to be immediately removed
to his. own, residence; the furniture and
all else of the. contents of the room'were
conveyed to an auctioi-room, sold, and
the receiptii herefor 'duly transferred per
cheque to the keeping, of, the Christian
banker.
At the sale of these effects among other
auditors o othe voluble auctioneer, was
Madame Gringo Clutchit..
Wbat Madame ,Gringo Clutchit desired
to purchase, if, it could be obtained with
the limited sum at her immediate disposal,
was a lounge.
She bid on i lounge, and it was hers.
So to - the i Clutchit 'mansion-apart-
ments rather-the lounge, once the prop-
,rty of the cashier, was transported.
Onthe Monday afternoon following the
Saturday evening in which he had shad-
owed Mrs.: Clutchit from  the market.
Mr. John Trueman was seated ,on that
lounge awaiting the. arrival, momentarily
expected, of Mr. Clutebit.
Duval did,-not mourn, over the loss ot
I his faithful ,servitor-he would ,ot have
mourned if that seritor had been his
own brother, or even. son. But over the
loss of a few thousanfd dollars his grier
would have been profound.
The cashier's.position made vacant by
t the, death'ofKramp wasspeodily filled by
- a"1 gentlemans- son "r. anF. F.-whose
f father . banked" heavily in  Daval's
house. Duval accepted this young gen-


94                ]BETWEEN THE CRUSTS.

tleman f )r two reasons --one because his
father's account in the bank was ample
security, as he imagined, for the official's
honesty; the second, because the salary
was to be nothing for the first year, to.be
increased to such amount in the second
year as the great banker might deem a fit
equivalent for services rendered.
Per contra, the young F. F-this bit-of
rich flavoring of the social upper crust-
accepted, that's the high-toned way -of
putting it, the situation under a pretense
of an earnest desire to learn the banking
business, but in reality because he was
forced to it by his father to "settle him
down " and bring him to a-realization of
the fact that there were, other and more
useful aims in life than billiards, swell
suppers, and guzzling wine.
This new cashier was no other' than
Namby Shragg, the son      of Carlton
Shrugg, heretofore referred to in this
veracious history as being a blue blood
of the most exalted type.
Young Shrugg. concealed whatever dis-
gust he may have felt at being thus cor-
nered by the "old man," or of being even
for a few hours each day a monetary ap-
prentice in the banking-house of even so
great a financier as Jerome Duval.
He made up for it after hours.
Meanwhile, Duval had placed .over this
young sprig of the avenue, in the osten-
sible capacity of instructor, but really as
a guard, one of his oldest officials-.his
paying teller, who said little, and that lit-
tle in as surly, cart, and disagreeable a
mauner as possible.
Especially did he. snub Namby Shrugg,
rather than instruct him in the routine of
his duties, for he had, upon the death of
Kramp, Indulged in the hope that he
would have been promoted, as a mark of
confidence and a reward for his long ser-
vice, to the vacancy.
Shrugg was too lofty and airy in style
for the old paying teller. But complaint
was useless. Duval never heeded the
complaints of his employees; if they
didn't like their position, they were at lib-
erty to depart at once,

At home Duval remained the imperious-
autocrat-the lord of all he surveyed,
whose right none dared dispute.
The servants moved like shadows in
his presence; below stairs, in solemn con-
clave and with bated breath, they dis-
cussed his absolute tyranny to their hearts'
content, but with no hint at rebeUion.
Their places were too good for that;
besides, his sternness was in a measure
compensated for by the gentleness and
kindness of Edith and her mother, who
since the revelation of the Poll street hor-
ror had clung together seemingly with no
other interest or feeling in common with
the father and husband than that which
involved the observance of the ordinary
duties of the household. They gave Je-
rome Duval their duty-all that might
have been of affection orlove or genuine
respect had been crushed out by the re-
membrance of his past cruelty and the
inhuman treatment the deAd sister, his
daughter, had received at his hands. He
bad compelled Edith's mother to silence,
but he had crushedher heart in doing it.
Glenham resolved to beard the lion in
his den, for ,with such a weapon as the
written statement left him by the cashier,
there could be but little doubt, arguedhe,
of the result.
Heretofore, under various pretexts, he
had declined invitations from Edith to visit
the Duval palace-pretexts-the very fem-
inineness of which he was heartily asham-
ed. He had, too, despite, his ne w-found
courage in thus daring.the presence of the
man he hated, a vague presentiment that
the struggle was approaching the cloge-
that this act in the-drama of his life was
soon to be ended.
It was near eight o'clock in the evening
when he alighted from his carriage in front
of the banker's -residence and ascended
the broad stone steps, over which frowned
the heavy carved arch of the entrance.
How well he renietnbered it! How, in
the years gone by, he had so often entered
there fall of hope, pride, and with before
him a future seemingly cloudless. And
now !-

The thought of all he had suffered since
then, ?tnd of the man who caused it, caine
upon him, and for the instant he felt like
strangling the banker as he would a dog.
The windows of the drawing-room above
and of the reception-roon below were
lighted.
Eviden bly.visitors were present.
He paused a moment. In that moment,.
by an effort, he recovered his usual appar-
ent serenity.
His summons was answered by one of
the servants, one who, in the long ago,
had often admitted him.
He handed his card to the servant.,
"Miss Edith?" said the functionary.
" Step into the reception-room,'sir, I will
see,"
Even the reception-room, save the new
frescoing of the walls and one or two ad-
ditional paintings, was unchanged in ap-
pearance.
Presently the servant returned. "Miss
Edith Diival-is in." -, -.
I And theservant, with all due ceremony,
conducted Glenham up the' great stair-
case to the, drawing-room, announced
"Mr. Robert Glenham," and'retired.
Contrary to his anticipation; there were
no visitors; only, neawone of the crimson-
draped windows, one person.
Edith.
As -the servant announced his name and
retired, closing the doof After him, she
arose from her seat-and advanced, a plea-
sant sile lighting up her face, toward
Glenham.
" At last, Mr. Glenham," she said " you
have-"
"Honored myself by keeping one of m3
.Innumerable promises to call. I can onl
hope thatmy punctuality in this instanc
will be accepted as a palliation of my de
linquency in the:past."
. " Thank you," she said, "for the inter
ruption.  Now then, sir knight of th
sedate countenance, suppose you do pen
ance by dropping ceremony and playin
the part of oa ,of the most constant o
'visitors-for 'this oedasioi only-as th
playbills have it."

Glenham seated himself near her.
The man of the world in her presence
began to forget his purpose upon her
father.  --
The  conversation thus beginning in
pleasant raillery soon passed into another
channel, and almost before either were
aware of it, they began to speak . in
lower tones; and, at last, he drawing his
seat nearer her, and taking her hand in
his, the secret was revealed.
" Edith," he said, and his voice, in spite
of himself, trembled. "Edith, let us unt-
derstand one another better. I mean, let
us understand by utterance what at least
I have these many weeks thought of-
hoped for-- and whether you have thought
of it or not, it is better ,e should speak
frankly, and so end this suspense. Edith,
by every token and act by which an hon.
orable man :can make known, without
speakinghis thought, I have endeavoredto
convey to you an expression of my feel-
ings. I do not think you can have failed
to comprehend it."
"Mr. Glenham-"
' "Please hear me out, and then-and
then I will be the listener." A silence en-
sued, then Glenham abruptly, but in a tone
of gentleness, said: "Edith, I love you.
It is useless to annoy you in this with
the wild rhapsody which you find in the
utterance of the' heroes of sentimental
novels. In simple words which 'express
the yearnings of my heart, I only say,
Edith, I love you, and ask in return no-
thing new save the frank ansWer which ia
to decide my fate. Your assent will make
me a happier man, and bring sunshine
y upon a lonel', clouded life; a refusal will
y simply leave me to go on in my appointed
e path, 'through its loneliness, its gloom,
- with what courage and fortitude the heart
may have which resolutely strives to bear
its grief in silence."
oe The girt, while he spoke, her hand still
- resting in his, had not raised her eyes; she
g sat as passive and motionless as one in a
)f trance.
e    Slowly she raised her hand,-and in the
blush which mantled her fair cheek and the

softened expression of her eyes, as they
met his earnest look, he read his answer
before she uttered it.
" Robert-.Mr. Glenham-I-. There,
you have my hand in yours. You have my
love, and-"
"Say no more," exclaimed Glenham,
". The outspoken honest trust and confi-
deuce of a love like yours are like a gleam
of Paradise in this world. Once more the
sun shines, the clouds have passed, and
let us hope that our lives in the future
may be as calm and peaceful-"
The door opened, and the servant en-
tered.
" Miss Edith, your father wishes to know
if you are engaged "
As she replied, she gave Glenham. an
arch smile-No-yes-Does he wish me
to come up to himi7"      ,       .t
" No, Miss Edith; he tolame to say that
:if you weren't.engaged, he'd come here."
"Tell him I am not engaged."-
"Except to me," whispered Glenham to
her as the servant disappeared..
A blush and a soft pressure of the hand,
was her only reply.
Then she arose and seated herself at the
piano.                         ..-
"Mr. Glenham-Robert, I mean-now,
do you remember 'the air Gazzaniga 'was
singing when you came into our ,box at

"Yes, to be ure. Come now, let me see
if your memory-     .        .
" You mut remember," he replied, as
standing at the corner, of the piano, he
rested his band upon it, '1you must re-
member that then you filled my tko,0ghts,
and it was qnly the music of your
voice-'.-
" Now,Robert," she Interrupted, hold-

-" you are verging upon the province of

Again the door opened, and Jerqme Dn-
val, In gowni and slippers, with a velvet
-smokiag cap upon his bead,.came in.-

The dreAded moment had arrived.

ing toward him.
" I thought yomwere not engaged, I see
you have a visitor,"' said Duval.
, " Rob-Mr. Glenham, this ia my fath-
er."
Not a muscle, not a nervo of Glenham's
face quivered as with a smile he confront-
ed. the banker,-aid extended his hands
"Mr. Jerome Duval, I am happy in
making your acquaintances"
Duval took the proffered hand and
bowed.
"I know that in-extending my hand
upon introduction as a visitorI may have
transcended the observance of d'awing-
room etiquette, Mr. Duval, but it is aous-.
tom in which I frankly own I often forget
ihyself."
Duval gave him as,he uttered this apol-
ogy the benefit of a searching look, a look
whicb he remembered long after.
"Your social position, Mr. Glenhani, of
which from, report 12 am well aware, and,
acquaintance with my daughter, of which
I believe I was not apprised of,"-here he
gave.Edith aismile-" are ample explana-
tion of your adherence. to a custom which
has in it ao much ,ofearnest and fraulk-
ness."
With which somewhat stilted reply the
great banker again bowed.
"This is Mr. Glenhain's first call, fath-
er," said Edith, "and I am glad .it has
brough you and him together.  She was
going to say more, but somehow, she brqke
down.
She was not equal to the occasion, for
her lips were not uttering her thoughts.

BETWEEN THE CRUSTS.

To say that to Duval the crash was en-
tirely unexpected would be wrong.
But he thought he had so hedged him-i
self about with collateral resources which,
however great the run upon' his house
might be, would bridge him over in safe-
ty. The Great Frogtown and Greenland
Grand Trunk Railroad with the Arctic
extension was to have been the crowning
glory of his life; he was its life, its
sponsor, and he indorsed his faith in it by
every means in his power. He issued
circulars describing the immense wealth
in the corporation and the enormous divi-
dends the road would pay; lithographs
and chromos were scattered throughout
the length and breadth of the land, giving
alluring views of the grand scenery along
the line of the road, and the stock shares
were printed upon the finest of bank note
paper, in the most elaborate style of the
steel engraver's art.
By this widespread system of adver-
tising by the easy subornation of half a
dozen government organs and daily jour-
nals, by distributing shares of the stock
among congressmen and other official pat-
riots whose services or influeince might be
or was useful, and by his own influence
on 'Change, the quotations of the Frog-
town and G. G. T. R. R. had gone up so
that in the popular view to hold a share
was equal to having possession of that
much gold.
Besides, was not Jerome Duval its
sponsor?. So everybody, widows, work-
ing men, tradesmen, and all classes invest-
ed their savings in this famous stock.
Then, too, to be a depositor in the great
banking house of Jerome Duval was to
be accounted safe and in .A 1 standing.
Merchants,   lesser  bankers,   brokers,
financiers, manufacturers, and commercial
men and professional men of every degree
considered it an especial privilege to de-
posit and hold account in his bank.
"So when the crash came, when through an.oversight

nominal value-what else could he do but, like a hunted
stag at bay, face destruction as best he ingsht i
Thus was 'his failure accounted for by
the daily papers.- The doors were -closed,
and in the midst of the ruin and wrecks
around him he stood up-enly a man-
with none so poor as to do him reverence.
From his closed banking house, he
was driven slowly to his home in his
carriage-a monarch of the monetary
world no longer. All the wealth he had
garnered would not suffice to save him.
He had fallen with his ladder, and the
country was ringing with the news.
As he bad made his bed so he must lie.
' There was yet, though he little dreamed
it, another and greater blow impending.
This financial ruin was only the-shadow
of the coming Nemesis.
Glenham-and Glenham's joy over the
banker's downfall was tinged by no touch
of satiety.
He -was resolved 'to have the full
measure of his revenge after he had mar-
ried Edith.
Yet he was sorry-he had a regret con-
corning her father's financial wreck, and
that was that he could not have stricken
him down in the midst of his wealth, and
when surrounded, by all the pomps and
vanities and splendor with which he had
exalted himself. For with the precious
document which he held in the handwrit-
ing of Abel Kramp, he himself 'could
have toppled over the huge fabric of the
banker's fortune.
As Glenham laid aside the last of the
morning papers he had been reading con-
taining the latest disclosures and the
very latest reports of the lesser failures
brought about by the toppling of their
great idol, he drew from his pocket the
"1 document."'
That was the name he had given it.
It was, rather, a revelation.
"Useless now, " he said, as he glanced
over it;  useless now-only as an evi-
dence which I can yet show to Duval to
prove that I know the real cause of his

ous crowd of creditora,will not rest untilI
he is stripped of every, vestige of U.is
wealth-every dollar will have to be yield-
ed up to satisfy the Moloch of the law.
And while he grovels in abasement, and
is dragged down by unrelenting fate to
poverty-I, whom he expelled from his
presence; I, whom, with ,all the devilish
trickery and devices his wealth could
furnish, he drove step by step to degrada-
tion, can revel in luxury; aye! and bring
him cringing to my doors for relief. Ah
after all this whirligig time rights all
things at last., I will see Edith. She is
fast as love can bind her. His pride, for-
tune, power ,swept away-it remains for
me to crown the ruin by taking from him
his sole . remaining treasure--.his only
child. It will be consoling for him to
learn that she Is the wife of his dead
daughter's husband." .
While Glenham thus gloated over the
retribution that had fallen upon his ene-
my there was fast' and surely follow-
ing him a revelation which boded him a
fate he might have avoided,,had he con-
sidered his own safety rather than made
-his mind the mere nurse to a spirit of re-
venge.
CHAPTER XLII.
CLOSING IN.
IN addition to the torn letter, the me-
dallion ring, the narrative of the coroner
concerning the inquest in Pel street, and
his surmise as to the true ownership or
the riug. John Trueman suddenly re-
membered the note which Miss Trainor
had addressed him concerning the ticket
in the Havana lottery.
"By John Rogers !" said the detective,
"I had almost forgotten that. There may
be nothingin it-and yet-prizes are not
-so often drawn. Let me see if he had the
ticket in his pocket at the time he was
made, away with the, robbers who went
through him-if it did come up a prize,

103

would have drawn the prize here in
town. Those tickets are, good anywhere;
any dealer in that sort of . thing-any
broker will cash them. It's worth looking
after."
Mr. John Trueman at once resolved -as
he expressed it "for a flyer "-to inquire
into this little matter, so without much
delay proceeded to make himself visible
in the offices of divers of the brokers in
Wall street, who advertised somewhat ex-
tensively these schemes of chance.
Two or three of the brokers hadn't sold
a prize or cashed one within two years-
this they -told him as an official-in confi-
dence. At length he- entered the last
office in which he considered it likely the
holder of the ticket would have gone.
When. Trueman entered, there was the
elaborately dressed clerk, with his hair
parted in the middle, and his blonde
moustache as marvelously waxed and
pointed as when Glenhama had surprised
him undergoing the pleasant labor of
scraping his finger nails with the in-
finitesimal pen-knife. He lifted and drop-
ped his eyelids at the entrance of True-
nan as lazilyas before,
The huge and, fancifully painted safe,
the long desk covered with papers, the
polished counter were all there. As True-
man came in, instead of the clerk being
oblged to undergo the painful operation
of conversing upon business matters, the
little short-bodied, bustling broker him-
self came up.
"Ah-anything in tickets" ,said the
broker.
Yes," leisurely replied Trueman. "I
don't know that I wish'to invest just now
-but-yes-perhaps I may. Have you
sold any big hits lately?"
' Um    In what lottery - Kaintuck,
Delaware, or the er--ah--Havana I
" Well-say' the Havana," remarked
Truemaan, "that seems to show up the
heaviest in hits-eh'I"
" Ah--let me see'- yes -no-no, sir.
The sale has been very light lately of
Havanais Kentuck's played mostly."
" I s'pose you have-you do sell a prize

in the Havapa now and then. What's the
biggest you ever sold -do you remember
Perhaps the numbers that drew them-may
be good agaii."
The broker 'paused. Then he tapped
his forehead with his finger, looked at the,
clerk who lifted his eyelids .and looked
out through the front window at a pass
ing wompn, and then wearily dropped his
eyelids. -
' Now I remember. Oh yes. I know.
The biggest prize I have sold sice i
moved in here was-no I didn't sell it
either. I'll' tell you how it was, wait a
moment" The little man turned around
and thrusting his hand into the gigantic
safe drew forth a large book, laid it upon
the counter and opened it.
" Now then; 'let me see. November,
December-no-ah-here it is in March.
Yes, March is the month. 11ere's the en-
try. On the teuth of March. Ticket
numbered 1939  One hundred thousand
dollais. First advance, five +housand dol-
lars by cheque; .March the thirtieth paid
balance, ninety-fiye thousand dollars, less
five per cent. discount. Now then," ad-
ded tie little man looking up.  "The
party who presented this ticket said he
bought it in London; thit he had ergot-
ten all about it until the day he came in
here. He seemed excited."
"Yes," said the clerk lifting his eyelids
and glancing at .Trueman, "he spoke so
quickly and so loud that he made me jab
my peiilife into my finger."
Trueman smiled. He began to make a
show of beinginterested, which encouraged
the broker to think he Vnight have a cus-
tomer before him.
"tWould you know him if you saw him
again?"
"Certainly," replied the broker, "be-
sidos lI pow his name."  '
"Ah!" . snid Trueman, inquiringly.
" Iferwas an Englishman, I s'poseI"
"No, American; ft'ely dressed, gentle.

tl4t. At least the name he gave.me as

his own. It might have been a false one,
thoUtgh. Here it is."
"What is itt"
"Robert Glenham, of New Orleans."
Trueman betrayed' no surprise.. That
wasn t his style.
'Robert Glenham. And the, chequea
you-gave him; were theypayable, to hi-s
order ?..
"To his order, certainly."
"He was a lucky man.    Ud like to
make a hit like that'myself. When is the
next drawing?" '
"On the-fifteenth."
"Have you -that number in your
packages--1939?"
" I'll see; if I haven't it's likely I can get
it for you," and the, little broker once
more thrust his arm into the big safe.
"You can look it .up, and I'lldrop in
in the course of an hour. Ive got to! run
over in Exchange place a moment-just
look it up for me."
" With pleasure, sir."
And Mr. John Trueman' bowed himself
out of the office.
Once'out he emitted, from between: his
closed lips that sort of a low, long drawn
whistle which might not ibe. inappro-
priately teamed a musical-chupkle..
q R-o-b-e-r-t G-1-e-n-h-a-m I .Well, I
am in luck, if I never was before. llen-
ham is the signature upon that cheque
paid by St. Leon to Clutchit's employer.
Either that cheque is 'another forgery of
St. Leon's, or he and Glenham are birds
of a feather. My mind is made up. I'll
nab St. -Leon. That'll be step number
one. Step number two,- interview Glien-
ham in relation to the cheque.' 'And tep
number three-'ll think about that.' I
think Fm the one who will unrAviel this
precious tangle.' Drill has business with
this Glenham; but Drill is .close as an
oyster. Never mind, I'll see." 'S6 cogitat-
ing he went his 'way not a little.elated-
with the discovery of the lottery tiokat
clue.
Now he had the torn -letter, the ring,
the secret of the lottery ticket, and the

CHAPTER XLIII.
THU MAJRIAGE OF EDITH DUVAL'.
Trgreatfront of, the ,rsidence of Je-
Tome    val was dark,the  avily @aped
WdQwagave none of the wonted signs of
eythin; ,there might have been death
there,. or the splendidly appointed palace
deserted for all of show of occupancy
visible to the passer by.
Glenhapn ascending thesteps, hesitated.
Why sould he obtrilde himself upon the
familyin that moment mhen itshead had
been stricken down from the Jeight of
fortune to common povertyI
WouldEdith receive him at such a
tim  I  .
These were the questions which arose
in his mind and made him momentarily
hesitate.
''Then, as if decided, he rang the bell.
The servant ushered him into the recep-
tion-room, and in a few moments returned
with the answer: "Miss Duv,al is in. This
way, sir."f
Uip'to the 'driawing-room as before.
Her their Was with her.
Evidentlythere had been something of
serious import in -their conversation*
Duval looked old, careworn, and 'there
was a careless disregard of his usual neat.,
ness in his attire.
Ih voice was husky and tremulous..
It was plainly apparent-that 6e' was un-.
dergoing.some, terrible jn0rtal ordeal )an
ordeal th~ttonly the great calaiity Which

There'wsistraces of tears upon her fair
fae and inher eyes there was'that dim,
wistful expression w#ih  nil  trouble
dri
As'Vxiiham entered Duval arose and,
sile tly'saluted hhh; the'iYeseated hhn-
splf.  From Edith Glenham -received
faint mile of recognition.
hM. Glenliam your visit could not,
-lave 1e ! mdde in better time."

"I am glad of It,",replied Glenham,
wonderingly.
"Mr, Glenham, you were the subject,
partly, of our conversation when your
presence was announced. Had you not
arrived, I should at a later hour have sent
for you.
"In what way is my presence so wel-
come?"
"Be seated, Mr. Glenham." Glenham
obeyed the Tequest, by placing himself
near Edith.
"Mr. Glenham, you pare, aware of the
;gneat ,agd un4expected  ophletiat iga
fallen uponme in fi pci l.1wAters., I am
to-dayreduped ,to ,the plane of poverty
from whch I firtarose. Of the puse of
my downfall I alone know tlAe eet, for
the one who has wrought this nisery is
dead. The world and Wall street say--and
Have not contradicted it-that my failure
Is due to the collapse of' my great railway
scheme. t is not so. That was nothing!"
Glenham 'stared curiously at him, and
instinctively, as if anticipating what was
to come, placed his hand over ,his, beast
pocket in which- was deposited the,'doca-
ment left him by the dead cashier.
- "I had, picashier, lately kifled 'by an
a;vidept ; Ips napme was l(amp.. I had
great, trwatin him, and h1obpettayed me"
"For -What reasotut"
Dtival 'hesitated, -then, as 'if choking
down some latent impulsaeof truth. contin-
utd, "I-I-Iknow not. He had no reason.
Had he not been killed sosuddenly, one
week longer of life would have beheld him
an innate -of the Totnb1 on a charge of
embezzlement. I had for week since. I
aidedentally discovered his-hi'crme,
'been preparingfor ikb"
"En beislement !" taid Glenham.
"Yesfor I' discovered 'thathe had ab-
stracted, by means 'of Ihis'entire 'control
over the aWfairs of the bank,'fom the safes
nearly a million dollars worth of securities
-stocks, bonds, and mortgages, and 'by
meansof damiiiesandcopies, andfalse en--
triesblinded niy eyes as-to the reality c6f his
gigantis cime. These securities were the

property of various depositors, in my
hands for safe keeping."
" Did you not at' once tax, him with
this I"
"No. I waited until I could make all
sure."
Glenham well knew the reason Duval
had not at once brought the cashier to
punishment.
"This blow crushed me," said, Duval.
I I saw the inevitable end coming, and
yet I strove by all the means in my power
to avert it. Had it not been for this sud-
den panic, which has involved all through
the country so many failures, I might,
perhaps, have conquered, and my house
still retained untarnished its great name.
As it is I am-"
He broke down for the instant.
Edith sat motionless.
Glenham was about to speak when Du-
val recovered himself and continued:
"Mr Glenham, five days ago I had hoped
that this house would have been graced
by the wedding of my daughter Edith to
the son of one of the wealthiest men in
the city-"
"Father!" exclaimed Edith.
"That marriage is impossible now.
Perhaps from what I have since, even to-
day, learned, it would still have been im
possible, for Edith has confessed that she
has formed an attachment for you, and
further, that an engagement has taken
place. Upon two conditions I give my con-
sent."
f What are the conditions, Mr. Duval'
asked Glenham.,
" The first condition is that you place
to her credit and solely to her own use the
sum of fifty thousand dollars, and provide
an annuity for her mother-who now lie
ill from the effects of this calamity whicl
has fallen on us-of five thousand a year
the second is that the marriage shall b
strictly private, and shall take place i
this apartment immediately!"
If Glenham had been before surprised
he was now amazed. Edith extended-he
hand and placed it in his, and murmured

" Robert, can you do this ? If not, it shall
not separate us.".,
"To the.conditions I assent, Mr. Duval,
with* this proviso, that here I draw up, a
memorandum of agreement to be ratified
hereafter; to the fulfllment of which I
pledge myself, and that the marriage
shall take place, as we are, without
other preparation, and within half an
hour."
To this Duval consented. Within half
an hour a carriage was sent for a minister.
By the time he arrived the memorandiim
was drawn up and signed.
Edith, blushing and terrified, yet with
an expression of love and 'trustful hope
gleaming through her tears, placed her
-aand in that of Glenbam's, and they stood
up in the dimly-lighted room, with her
father at her side.
The marriage service was soon perform-
ed, and the minister departed.
CHAPTER XLIV-
BROUGHT TO BAY AT LAST.
"AT least, Edith," said Duval,'"if all
my plans for your future have failed, I
,have, in this moment of my supremest
grief and ruin, provided for you.",
"Dear father, all is not yet lost. Your
name-"
A servant entered and announced a
visitor.
"Mr. John Trueman!"
"What is his business " said Duval.
"He says it isof the utmost importance.
He also asked for a Mr. Gunnem.",
" Glenham, he means," said Glenham.
" Well, admit him. I will see him."
A moment later, and Mr. John True..
man entered.I
"I beg pardon for this intrusion," he
h said, "But my business is of that sort
which don't allow much ceremony. It is
e with Mr. Glenham that I have this busi-
n ness to transact."
" Some other time. This is neither time
nor place," interrprpted Duval. "Mr. Glen-
r ham is engaged now. ,Wait below in
the reception room."

Sorry, but I can not. My appoint-
ments are numerous and my'time is lim-
ited- Life is short, and waiting don't
lengthen it. Mr. Glenham, I called an
hour or more ago at your hotel. As I
came up I saw you enter your carriage,
and heard your direction tq the driver.,
Had I been a few moments sooner I would
riot have had occasion to follow you here.
Mr Glenham you're WANTED I"
WantedI Why, what do you mean I"
Shall I speak it out here before this
-lady and Mr. Duval?"
Certainly. Out with it, and then take
your leave," said Glenham, sharply. "You
are an entire stranger to me, and I can
not for the life of me imagine what urgen-
ey there, can be in your business whatever
it may be."
"Mr. Glenham, my name is John True-
man. My business, as this shield will in-
form you, is that of a detective!"
"A detective!"
Glenham paled.
4 Yes, sir, and it is you I want.".
" Me-I-what for?"
"Ihave a warrant, drawn up this morn-
ing, -for your arrest. In this warrant you
are charged with the murder of. Robert
Treinor on the night of the fifth of March,
eighteen hundred and fifty-five."
Had a thunderbolt fallen at his feet,
Glenham  could not have been   more
stunned than by this terrible accusation.
Duval became almost livid in the face,.
Mr. Trueman was used to such scenes.
He was as calm as if he were merely in-
viting a friend to dinner,
"Not only for the murder, but the rob-
bery of Robert Trainor on that night."
"'No, no! It is false !. On my soul I am
as innocent of that crime as-as-you
are," he cried.I
" That's to be settled hereafter. You
are not Robert Glenham. Here is a torn
letter found in the cellar in Pell street in
which you lived, and into which by some
means this man Trainor was decoyed,'
murdered, robbed, and stripped of his
clothing.  This letter was written by
your wife, Mary Jaffray, and addressed

to hernother. Here, too, is a ring found
irpon the finger of the murdered man,
Vith hi initials uppnit. 4nd to makq ps-
surance doubly sure in the tra* of cir-
cumstantial evidence, there was among
the papers in the possession of Robert
Trainor attthe time of the ipurder a ticket
in the Bavavi Igottery numbered 1-9-3-9,
which drew a prize of one hundred thou-
sand dollars. That ticket you presented
and drew the money for. Your real name
is George Jaffi'ay, and by that name I ar-
rest you!I"
Glenham, with one last pitying glance
at Edith turned, boldly and confronted
his accuser and the banker.
"Further concealment is useless. Yes,
I am George Jaffray i but I am not guilty
of murder. I have i ot that terrible crime
to answer for." Here, Jaffray-not to, tlhe
detective but to Duval, not deigning to
notice the official-related the story of
that terrible night in tho Poll street base-
ment-the death of his wife by starvation
and his flight. '"And oyer her dead body
I solemnly swore to bitterly revenge the
misery and suffering you brought upon
her and upon me. You drove me step by
step from afluence into the dark depths
of poverty, You cast ;your, child, ny
wife, off-thrust her from her home. You
did this jin the plenitude .of your wealth
and pride. You would not have ,your
daughter wed a man without position and
wealth. You have met your reward. You
pursued me with the vindictiveness of a
fiend. I have followed you with no dther
feeling than-that of triumphing over your
downfall., It was I who attended Abel

hands he placed among    others this

revelation,had sank back into an .easy
chair and had sat there motionless,' his
eyes fixed upon Jaifray with a stolid
stare.
His face was as rigid and white as that
of a dead person.
Edith flung herself upon his breast.
"Oh, father, father!"  But he moved
not.

Then he turned to Jaifray.
" 1 am sorry for this, sir," he said, and
his voice dropped Almost to a whisper,
pointing to the banker. "But-but--he'is
dead I She had better be removed. This,
Is the worst case'I ever had."
"iEdith !" said Jaifray, "Edith!"
She looked up at him.
How changed her expression 1'She arose
and grasped Jafray by the hand.
" Conie," she 8a'id; "come! W'll-go and
get married now, and we 11 have a royal
wedding. Come, father, come, you must
be with us, and bring mother and Mary
with you."-
"My God! She's crazed,' exclaimed
Glenham.
"Mad, surely !" said Trueman.   He
'ushed to the door and shouted for the
servants. 'They dame pouring in.
4 1Anil this is my revenge?!" was the only
utterance of George Jaifray.
.      .        .    9
The end had come. In the confusion of
the moment Trueman had forgotten his
usual caution and watchfulness, and when
he turned toward where Jaifray-had ,been
standing he was gone.

inmate of an asylum near the city, h pe-

The memory of the Pell street tragedy
