Thinkest thou there are no serpents in the world But those who slide along the grassy sod, And sting the luckless foot that presses them? There are who in the path of sdcial life Do bask their spotted skins in fortune's sun, And sting the soul. - Ay, till its healthful frame Is changed to secret, festering, sore disease, So deadly is the wound. JOANNA BAILLIE'S DE MOUNTFORD. Give me good proofs of what you have alleged: 'T is not enough to say, in such a bush There lies a thief- in sucI a cave a beast; But you must show him to me ere I shoot, Else I may kill one of my straggling sheep : I'm fond of no man's person, but his virtue. CRoWN'S FIRST PART or HENRY VI. "HOLLO, Ed.!" said a little eight-year old urchin, looking up at a smiling face peeping over his shoulder; "where have you been all the week?" O, Willie, I've been at Nahant glorious old Nahant!  Were you ever there, Willie?  "No, Ed.; what kind of a place is it?"     6        CARRIE EMERSON. "What kind of a place? Just ask your father t to ake you there once. I guess you'd say it was worth going to see' "Pho! I don't believe it's so very wonderful." "That's because you don't know any better. There 's noth ing here worth looking at, except the locomotive, and that's nothing after you 'e seen it a few times. I say, Willie, you ought to go to Nahant; 'tis glorious, and no mistake." "Well, just tell us what you've seen," said the little shaver, reddening at the imputation cast upon his quiet neighborhood. O, I 've seen lots, Willie!-the Spouting Horn; the Swal- low's Cave; the smooth sea-beach, much as five miles long (there isn't anything round here like it); the ocean, all covered with saips and boats; beautiful scenery, and many more things, too numerous to mention. Besides, there's the sea-serpent. Don't you know the sea-serpent is always seen off Nahant?" "The sea-serpent! did you see it yourself, Ed.?" "No; 't isn't always to be seen, Willie; but that's the place to see it, anyhow, and if I were you I'd go. This place isn't worth a copper; I don't believe there's a curiosity in it." "I do," said Willie, indignantly; " there's a whole lot of plum-pudding rock, that the giant threw about one 'lection- day." Pho! I don't believe it. Who says so?" O, I heald my mother reading about it in a book -I re- member, Holmes's poems; and it is just as likely to be true as your sea-serpent." "Well, that's all; and that is as old as the hills. I don't   ' Yes, I can, Ed.," said the boy, lowering his voice. "I heard somebody say, the other day, that there was a back- biter just below here; and I should n't wonder if it was full as bad as your sea-serpent." "Where did it come from, Willie? did you hear?." "No; from somewhere down-east, I guess. But what gre you laughing at, Ed.? Guess you 'll find it's true." "What does it look like, Willie?" "I don't know. I 'll ask my mother; she 'll know, for they said it tried to bite her, but could n't come it;" and Willie shook his curly pates and looked daggers down the street. "Go ask her now, Willie," said the fun-loving Ed,. I want to compare it with the sea-serpent. I guess it can't be men- tioned the same day with that old fellow." Off ran Willie with the momentous question, fully satisfied, in his own mind, that, from the name attached to the specimen in his neighborhood, it must be full as old, and twice as ugly, as any curiosity Nahant Her produced. "Mother," said the boy,. with a look of gravity; "Ed. 's been at Nahant, and seen everything grand; and, he didn't see the sea-serpent, but some folks has, and it's wonderful. He don't believe we've got anything here worth a cent. I told him we'd got a backbiter; but he don't believe it, and said if he knew where it was, he'd go and take a peep at it. Where is it, mother'?" "Hush, Willie! that is a very ugly name; you must n't speak it again."      8        CARRIE EMERSON. "(It's an ugly animal, too, is n't it, mother?" "Yes, my son, and you and Ed. had better keep your dis- tance." "Well, mother, what does it look like? If you don't tell me, Ed. will laugh." "It looks well enough, Willie; but it has a smooth, oily tongue, which is remarkable for a little poisoned barb, with which it is in the habit of striking the unwary the moment they turn their backs." N. "Did you ever see more than this one?" O, yes, Willie; there are plenty of them all over the world; but you must always shun them, if you don't wish to be bitten." "Well, si, what have you got to say about your serpent, hey? You look rather crest-fallen. I told you it would bear, no comparison with mine."- "And I say, it beats yours all hollow. It's better-looking than that old serpent; and it bites every time it gets a good chance; so we'll have to keep away from it! That's what my mother says, and I guess she knows. She says there's lots of 'em in the world, but no danger if we keep our distance." "Is she afraid, Willie?" "I guess not. I am though, and I mean to mind h&. I don't want to get bit." Ed. went into the house to give an account of his wander- ings. He was young and enthusiastic, had seen much of nature's glorious handiwork, aid hs thoughts were teeming with the promise of the unexplored future. Now and then a bright smile rippled over his handsome face as he 4'   CARRIE EMERSON.           9 thought of little Willie and his serpent; and he wondered why such monsters were permitted to dwell in a place that might be heaven without them; while Willie's curiosity stood a chance of dying a natural death, he not cloosing to run any fearful risk in gratifying it. But if Willie kept out of dan- ger, there were others not quite so fortunate. "Mother," said a fair girl, " 1 am giing to take my sew- ing, and sit a while with Mrs. Buncombe this afternoon; she is all'alone." "I would much rather you would stay away, Carrie; she is not the companion I would choose for you." "Why not, mother? I like her because she 's so lively and talkative. Why do you always seem to disapprove of my being i with her? She's just my age, too, and I'm so lonesome!" "Your age! I should think she was ten years your senior, and twice that in her knowledge of the world. Besides, your characters do not assimilate in the least." "How so?" "You will soon see, Carrie, when you become better acquainted. I do not wish to enumerate any of the faults I have detected; but I think her unpardonably ignorant. I fear she could scarcely sustain her part in an intellectual conver- sation. If she has read anything, it is light, trashy novels; and a vulgar love of dress is the amount of knowledge gained. Do you think she ever thought of storing her mind with any- thing useful? Remember, you have only met her a few times at parties, until very lately; and her frequent calls, within a week or two, are not very edifying, and to me not very agree- able. I distrust her, Carrie." /     10       CARRIE EMERSON. O, mother! I must say I think you tho severe; you judge her too harshly. The fact is, she is not liked by any one in the neighborhood, and it has prejudiced you." "No, Carrie; I am not apt to be influenced. There is a something about her that I do not like, however; and although she may be one of the best women in the world, yet no good ever came of such intimacies; and I 'm afraid you 'll see the folly when it is too late." "Why, mother, she can't hurt me, even if she is what you think, and what some of the neighbors say she is, ignorant, and a mischief-maker. I 've never seen any of it; and, let her be what she will, I'm certainly old enough to take care of myself; am I not?" ( I don't know about that, Carrie. People are often judged iy the company they keep. I tell you, I do not like her at all; and, although I wish you to treat every one politely, of course, I would have you avoid intimacy. She has a very bad habit of manoeuvring, which may some time place you in a very disagreeable situation, if she has not done so already." "She's a good friend to you. I've heard her praise you often." "I cannot say I'm much flattered by the compliment." "I'm sure she's very kind to tell us when the neighbors say anything about us." Anything against us, you mean. That is all I believe I ever heard her tell, and she soon found that was superfluous when she saw how little we cared about it." "Do, mother dear, try to conquer your antipathy, or what- ever it is; if you will, I know you 'll like her."   CARRIE EMERSON.          " "Mother," said the same voice a few hours later, "I wish you 'd remove from this horrid place' "Horrid place! Why I thought you liked it, Carrie." "Well, then, the people." What have the people to do with you, pray? Youihave very little to say to any one, I believe." "And I mean to have less. Why, they talk about us un- mercifully all the time." "How do you know that, Carrie?" " , M rs. Buncombe has been telling me! To be sure, come to sum it all up, it don't amount to much; but who wants to be talked about? I don't, at all events." "What do they say?" O, she did n't like to tell what they said. That's just what irritates me so. If any one uttered a falsehood about me, I'd confront them at once. It's hard to be slandered without a cause." "Perhaps they don't slander you, Carrie." "Yes they do, and you too, and all the rest of the family. I don't blame Mrs. Buncombe; she likes us, and don't wish to hurt our feelings by repeating what they say. Why do you smile, mother?" "You have more charity for her kindly feelings than I have. It would have shown a better-principle if she had held her tongue." " ell, won't you leave the place? It is getting more and more disagreeable every day. I'm sure I don't know whom to shun, or whom to believe. She says they are all alike; and I'm afraid it is so."     12        CARRkE EMERSON. "Shun her, and believe your mother, Carrie. But how does she know so much? No one visits her, or at least very few." "O, she gets it from her husband! She says he overhears things sometimes of his next door neighbor." "I don't believe a word of it. He don't seem like a tale- bearer; and would be more likely to curb her tongue than give it any license. It will be my last reason for leaving the place. You must learn to look within for resources, inde- pendent of others, Carrie." ,' Well, I am satisfied we haven't a better neighbor than Mrs. Buncombe; she is the only one that troubles herself to tell us what she hears." "I rather think she is our only enemy. All the rest, thank Ieaven, seem to have a better principle. I'm very sorry she ever came into our neighborhood." "Why won't you try and make some inquiries concerning her former character, just to satisfy me? If you find the least thing detrimental, I promise never to speakl to her again." "No, Carrie; it would not be right. With her former character we have nothing to do. If she were one of the lowest, very worst degraded, and I knew it well, and she wished to rise above such a level, I'd come boldly out, and be the first to help her. I do not believe any one ever fell so low as to be past retrieving, let people say what they will to the contrary. But there is with her a want of principle that will counteract every endeavor to benefit; a coarseness of mind, although hidden under a somewhat polished exterior, evidently so inborn and perfectly natural, that it would re- quire years of perseverance to overcome. Take a child with such a nature, and the task might be accomplished, in a short    . C:,y CARRIE E MEl RSON.             13 time, by-precept and example; but when years have hardened a coarse and obtuse nature, nothing but the power of God, almost in th 3 form of a miracle, can possibly change it." "I always thought you charitable," said Carrie, mourn- fully. "Do you think, dear mother, you are exercising quite enough towards your neighbor?" "I may be blinded somewhat by selfishness, Carrie; and, in seeking to ward off evil, not feel as I ought the full force of that best of all Christian virtues. You know the old saying: ' Meddle with the chimney-sweep, and you are sure to get smutted.' My own experience has long since taught me that what the conscience approves is the only safe judgment. We are quite as apt to overrate virtue as to condemn vice. I think in many instances man judges more severely than his Maker. It is perhaps the fault of nature, perhaps of educa- tion -like every other good thing, often perverted. A great portion of sin and misery, however, arises from ignorance." "Well, mother, it is an old saying, also, that it's half of anything to own it. Now, Mrs. Buncombe owns she is igno- rant; but then she always does it in a laughing kind of way, as if there could n't possibly be any shame attached to it. Do you think we ought to condemn her for what, perhaps, she could n't help? She may have been deprived of many of the advantages girls generally have." "She has tact enough to hide many of the imperfections, natural in such a case, beneath the gloss which general society gives any one, however deficient. She used vulgar expres- sions, for instance. The moment she found they were offensive here slhe dropped themn;, and it is only by an occasional slip of the tongue you would detect the habit. I do not wonder so 2     "       CARRIE  EMERSON. much at your being blinded. She certainly possesses the art of making herself very agreeable, where she chooses; but I have several times detected her in what, if it were not an un- truth, was truth sadly perverted; and I shouldn't wonder if you were the nest one to find her out." "Well, as I'm going away to-morrow, do try, if you please, mother, to be sociable with her; for, to tell the truth, I pity her as much, or more than I like her." "Mother!" exclaimed little Willie, a few days after, "I guess I 've found out what a backbiter is." "How so, my son?" "Why, it's a woman, mother, - a woman or a man either, I guess, - that speaks ill of every one behind their back, but is real good to their faces, you know." "How do you know, Willie? Xou must n't judge any one." "I did n't judge, mother; I heard Mrs. Buncombe give you and Carrie a real run to-day. She did n't know I heard her, but I did though. I'm going to tell my sister, when she gets home." "You must n't repeat what you hear, my, son; besides, I would much rather your sister would find out herself who her friends are. So, mind, you are to say nothing." "Well, I won't, then" but I felt flat when I found out the horrible creature was only a woman, after all. But here comes Ed. May I tell him, mother?" "Hollo, Willie! Have you had a peep at the new species of curiosity yet?" "( It is n't a new species, Ed.; it's common enough, after all." ' Why, what is it,'Willie? Have you seen it yet?"   CARRIE EMERSON.          15 "Seen her, you mean; it's a woman, Ed.! It 's one of our neighbors." "You don't say so Why, how astonishing!" (Yes, I do too. I have heard mother telling Caroline to be careful, and not go there very often; and I thought it was hard, if Carrie liked her; but I was sitting on her door-step to-day, and I heard her laughing about mother and Carrie, and some other people round here; and all at once I thought, ha! ha! I've found you out, Mrs. Backbiter " "Hush, Willie! that % a disgusting name; don't speak it again." "I She's a disgusting woman. Why don't you go down there, and give her a piece of your mind?" said the indignant youth, turning suddenly round to the boy's mother. "I 've a great mind to do it for you." "I think her infinitely below me," said the lady calmly. "I should be sorry to so far degrade myself; and am only too happy in the consciousness of my own superiority." About a week afterwards Carrie returned. "Did you have a good visit?" said a chorus of voices. "I should-but I heard something, the first day I went, that made me so indignant, it half spoiled my visit. One of the young ladies, who was here a while ago, told me that, every time I turned my back, Mrs. Buncombe talked about me ridiculously. Only think, mtother, of me, who defended her so often against my better reason and judgment! I should, per- haps, have doubted, but the truth was too palpable; there was no gainsaying it." "Who was your informer, Carrie?"     16       CARRIE EMERSON. "Lizzie Somers. You know she was often there without me.' "Lizzie Somers, indeed! If Mrs. Buncombe spoke the truth, Lizzie will have to come under the hateful name of tattler. According to all accounts, she talked about you shamefully; called you lazy and careless, proud and silly; besides making all sorts of observations about your dress, manners, etc.; and I cillle in for a share likewise." 'Why did n't you tell me before, mother?" "I did n't think it worth while, and would not repeat it now, only that I think it justice." "O dear! is n't it too bad, mother?" "Is n't what too bad, - that you should get bit, or that they should be the serpents?" " oth, to be sure." "But what are you going to do, Carrie?" said Ed. "( Can't you retaliate?" "Won't I?  No! Couldn't I?  Yes! That woman had better take care; the gloss is off now. How I do wish I had heard to you, mother! A good-for-nothing tattling creature! Heavens! how I scorr them both!" said the excited girl.   CHAPTER II. Examples I could cite you more, But be contented with these four; For, when one's proofs are aptly chosen, Q Four are as valid as four dozen. PRIOR'S ALMA. "WHAT 's the matter, Carrie? You surely are not so foolish as to let what you heard yesterday affect you." "Not what I heard about myself,- it was annoying, that 's all; but to hear Mary Grey slandered so,- such a good girl as she is,- it is too bad! Why, if her father should hear of it, he'd prosecute that woman; and serve her right, too." "They probably will not hear of it unless you tell them." "Of course I shall not. I consider it almost as bad to repeat a slander as to invent it." "If we always did so it would be happiest and best." How hard it is to know friend from foeI There is so much deceit in the world, it-seems almost impossble to find any one wholly free from it. I declare, it makes me shudder to think of it!" "The best way, Carrie, is to study ur own hearts faithfully, 2*     18       CARRIE EMERSON. correct what we find amiss, and leave the rest to God. When you have had half the experience I have, you'1 find that one half you hear is not worth listening to; the other not worth repeating." According to that theory, we must throw away one of the greatest charms in life, social converse." "You misunderstand me, Carrie. I mean only as far as individuality is concerned. For instance, you go to spend an afternoon or evening socially; and the lady you visit enter-  tains you with a list of grievances, such as the trouble she has had with her servants, children, etc. which, by the way, she knows you do not doubt, but does not feel that it cannot interest you as it does her); that her sister is spoiling her children - humoring one to death, sending another to an expensive school, when it is evident she cannot afford it any better than she can- buying new clothes for the elder, and cutting them over for the younger, etc. etc. (which may be all very right and proper, for aught she or you may know to the contrary); finding fault with the minister, because she couldn't keep her eyes open, when perhaps the fault lay in her own over- tasked strength,- she having sat up, until almost encroaching on the Sabbath, to finish a dress, which she exhibits to you with the very least appearance of vanity, and tells you that. it cost a great deal more than her husband could afford, but Mrs. A. had one, and she was not going to be outdone by her. "Then comes a long list of observations made the other evening at Mrs. G.'s party. "' Did you notice little Miss A.:?' ' Yes; did n't she look pretty?'   CARRIE  EMERSON.         19 "Pretty? yes; but did you notice what she had on?' "No, not particularly; what was it?' "' (Well, it was a silk that her mother had, I really believe, half a dozen years ago. I knew it by'the figure. Well, it has been colored, remodelled, and trimmed up, till it really looks like new. She little thought I ;should know the old thing again; but I did. It takes me to find such things out. Itell you I'm. a pretty keen observer. "'And did you see young Emery Wilson, hanging over-his uncle Henry's chair, watching thep play whist? He seemed to take as much interest in the game as if he held a hand himself. I expected to see him drop -into the first vacant seat, and take a part himself.' ' And what would be the harm?' you venture to say. "Harm! goodness, Carrie! he's a church-member, and so are his mother and sisters - bigoted ones too; they hold cards an utter abomination.' "'Well, perhaps he is mere liberal-minded; regarding it simply as an amusement, and of course thinking it no harm.' "'But just the idea of a church-member hanging over a card- table! We expect Christians to set us a good example, don't we? I ventured to give rhim a hint in the course of the even- ing,- I felt it to be my duty,- and what do you think? He told me, very pointedly, that it was a great deal better to be so employed than in making observations about our neighbors. I suppose he overheard a remark I had just made to Mrs. May, that I thought it rather out of place to see Helen Smith at a party' so soon after her uncle's death, and without a particle of mourning too.' "Again you venture to remark, Helen's uncle had been     20       CARRIE EMERSON. dead some months when they got the news; she is young, and very intimate with Annie G.; and besides, they do not, I know, approve of wearing black; they consider it a foolish custom, that ought to be done away with. "' Well, I don't. I think it a mark of respect to the dead it is our duty to pay, and I always set down the omission to a total want of feeling; not only of affection, but considera- tion of what the world may say or think of us.' '- Do you think, then, we ought to advocate openly what we disapprove inwardly?' , , Certainly! it is a duty we owe to society in general.' You are silent. Your hostess has conventionality on her side, and your homely, matter-of-fact conviction you fear will be overbalanced.  "After a brief pause,--'I couldn't help laughing at little Miss Chase's performance on the piano. Her mother ought to be ashamed to urge her to play before company, when she must be aware how little natural talent she possesses. The poor thing didn't wish to comply; but some of the young people urged her very hard, and then her mother whispered, loud enough for every one to hear, that it would be a breach of politeness to refuse. I know she thought it a good oppor- tunity for Annie to show off; and I know two or three, who only urged her in hopes she would fail. I for one should n't have cared; I do thoroughly detest that woman. She don't like me, either; she is always studiously cold, though very p lite. I don't care, as I said before, there's no love lost. 4 "'Do you play?' "' Me! no, indeed, I never had any talent for music, and I don't believe in cultivating one, do you?'   CARRIE EMERSON.          21 "' I do; I think with Mrs. Childs, it brings out all the good in a person's nature, and helps to subdue a1 the evil.' "O, yes! C Music hath charms to soothe a savage soul; To soften rocks, and bend the knotted oak." Is that it, Carrie? I'm not very apt at quotations, not having much tiime to read; however, we always take such things for granted, Iknowing there's good authority for them.' "It grows late, and you prepare to return home. The lady, all care and kindness, superintends the arrangement. Won't you have a warmer shawl, Carrie? And, mercy on me! here you are out without India rubbers; thin shoes, too, and the ground must be damp. Dear me! I know you'll take cold. Won't you?  Well, don't blame me if you are sick. Good- night, dear! Do come oftener; I'm always so delighted to see you! Tell your mother I'm coming round soon to givecher a scolding for permitting you to be so careless.' "Now, Carrie, this is a true sketch in perhaps five cases out of ten. You see I am charitable, making the odds even. How much of it do you think worth either listening to or re- peating?" "Why, mother, I call it downright scandal." "And yet, Carrie, we all listen blandly, even attentively; the soft voice and pleasant demeanor glossing it over so in- geniously that we are wholly off oir guard. It would be the height of injustice to denounce our entertainer as a scandal- monger; such a thought was probably as fir from her heart as from our own. For the world she would:not merit the im-- putation. For the world we would not accuse, much less judge, her harshly or falsely; so we swallow the disagreeable I    jL-     22       CARRIE EMERSON. dose much as we would a doctor's prescription, and get over the effects as quickly as possible, always laying the flattering unc- tion to our souls, ' Well, I'm better than Mrs. such an one.' Perhaps a little antipathy or unjustifiable prejudice is engen- dered, and may eventually take root, grow, and bear disagree- able fruit. But who ever thought of that?" "How, then, are we to do, dear mother?" "If we contradict, or disagree in sentiment, ten to one we quarrel,- to use anunqualificd term;- and there are too many just such ones in the world, and in society, as you describe. WAe don't wish to offend them. Always taking to ourselves the credit of more penetration than others, of course we do not wish to be the first to condemn a fault it may be was obvious to ourselves alone, and so we pass on to find the self- same trait exhibited, either more coarsely or more refinedly, according as the organizatibn develops the faculties. We make a friend by listening complacently; we are almost sure to make an enemy by openly expressing our disapprobation of such and such sentiments; always reserving to ourselves the right of enjoying an independent opinion. "But people who wink at the absurdities of others, -not to call them by a harsher name,-have no right to suppose they possess an independent opinion. There are, as I have told you before, many ways of softening an unwelcome truth; and your own good intention should be reward enough, even if you fail. An open enemy is far preferable to a false friend." "But it is very disagreeable to fly in the face of any one's opinion; especially one who professes friendship for you, and whom you do not wish to doubt." /h   CARRIE EMERSON.          23 "( Then let conscience be your best adviser. You remem- ber Ilervey Lincoln?" "Of course; he was an inmate of our family a long time. What a question!" "Well, when your father first proposed his coming, I objected to it very decidedly; in fact, I was bitterly prej- udiced, and fully determined, in my own mind, that into my family he should not come. 'What is the reason?' your father asked anxiously. "' I cannot tell you,' I said; 'I have my reasons though, and good ones too. If we must admit a stranger into the sanc- tuary of our home, let it be any other you choose, but not him.' "'This is very strange,' he said. ( You are not acquainted with him. I am. You do not suppose I would urge his coming here, if there were anything very disagreeable in his character. Come, try to conquer your antipathy, or, what is better, confide in me; perhaps I can do away the objection.' No; I was resolute. I would neither give my reasons, nor soften my determination. Well,' he said, at length, ' I have told him he might come to-morrow; and, as there is no plausi- ble excuse for not keeping my word, he must come; but I give you my solemn promise, if you find the shadow of a good reason, after you become acquainted, I will request him to leave forthwith.' "I sat a long time after he left me, turning over in my own mind all the reasons I could muster for maintaining the position I had taken. All that I knew against him had been confided to me by a young lady friend, who did not hesitate to call him a confirmed profligate; in other words, a disagreeable     24       "CARRIE EMERSON. blackguard, always ready to take up every word, and if pos- sible pervert it. I knew she was on intimate terms with his sisters, visited familiarly in his family, and could not possibly help knowing all about him; hence my determination. I saw myself in imagination made the butt of many an ill-natured re- mark; felt my indignation rising at a thousand innuendoes, too covert to rebuke openly, too impertinent to bear peaceably. The morrow came, and with it a sick headache, the invariable result of excitability. I had half a mind not to go down stairs for thl day; then, again, I was just in the mood to find fault. To tell the truth, I had not yielded to the force of circum-  stances, although I had apparently done so; and in this instance I made up my mind that I'd advocate my woman's rights to. the letter. He made his appearance, at noon, with your father. A dead silence followed my introduction to the inter- loper, as I was determined to regard him. We sat down to dinner, usually a very agreeable season with us, and finished our meal almost in silence. Immediately after, I retired to the nursery, directly over the parlor. I heard the sound of pleasant voices, and occasionally a merry laugh, which I was pleased to imagine was at my expense. In a few moments your father came in. ' Come down, won't you?' he said, pleasantly; 'Hervey is going to sing; it is something you have n't heard. He 's a splendid singer.' Now, I was pas- sionately fond of singing and music, and at any other time 'would have been delighted; but the word (and it is a hateful one), blackguard, rose up in my mind and I shook my head, and pleaded indisposition. In a few moments a rich voice gave forth a strain of melody, such as I had never listened to before, accompanied by the piano. I sat like one entranced.   CARRIE EMERSON.           25 One by one the mighty resolutions I had been framing flitted away, and, before the last stanza was completed, I had quietly -  taken my seat in the parlor, as if no disagreeable sensation . had ever come between me and the singer. I looked him calmly in the face. I could do so without being observed, for his whole soul seemed absorbed in the words he was uttering; and I, who prided myself upon my powers of penetration, was 1  obliged to succumb. Soon as the sound ceased I made my escape, feeling very much as if I had been guilty of a gross X  injustice. Well, where my friend ever got her reasons for slandering Hervey Lincoln I never knew, and never cared to ask. All I do know is, that, as far as I could judge, there was not the shadow of a reason for them. He wr; an inmate I  of our family more than three years, and never in all that time did he give me the slightest cause to regret his presence;   and to this day it would be hard to find among the many I regard as friends one who more richly deserves the name than himself, or one more truly beloved. For good and noble qualities, it would be hard for me to point out his superior; and though from our different positions we seldom meet, yet there is a bond of friendship which time or absence will never weaken, for it is founded on the only true basis, candor and esteem. "To prove that the lesson was not lost upon me, Carrie, I will mention one other circumstance. When our friend Lee wished me to receive young Melbourne into the family, it was, if anything, more repulsive to my feelings than in the former case. Your father was absent nearly all the time. Many cares had devolved upon me. We lived in a secluded place; we were somewhat reduced in circumstances, owing to a com- 3            0     26        CAR RIE EMERSON. bination of misfortunes. As is usual at such times, some who had formerly professed to regard us with friendly inter- est, turned the ' cold shoulder,' and I in my turn began to look with a jaundiced eye upon anything, which, while it promised pleasure, could so easily give pain. However, being strongly urged,-so strongly as to'leave me scarcely any chance of refusing; his reasons and my objections constantly clashing,- I overruled my aversion, and consented to take him. All the requisite arrangements were made, and in two weeks he was to take up his abode with us for an indefinite time; perhaps three months, perhaps a year. A few days after, a young gentleman called upon me, whom I esteemed highly, and, in the course of conversation, I mentioned the stranger who was to be with us in a few days. "' Who is he? What is his name? "I gave it. "Coming to rusticate, hey?' "I suppose so. Do you know him?' "Know him! I should be sorry to say I did. Why, he's the greatest scoundrel in his class, if not in the university to which he belongs.' "I was utterly confounded. I never foi a moment thought of doubting the words of my informant. I felt they were spoken in good faith. "What can I do?' I asked. ' Can I use your name as my authority? Of course I shall refuse to take him.' "' O, no! I do not know him personally. God forbid I should be so unfortunate! Nevertheless, my statement is true; I can find you plenty of proofs, if you wish.' - I did not wish it; I felt it was thp truth. After , few moments' reflection, I said,   CARRIE EMERSON.          27 He will be a very different person here; it is because he is tired of the life he has been living that he is coming to this, secluded place.' "'Humbug!' was the unqualified rejoinder. 'I tell you the devil might try to practise virtue with quite as much propri- ety. Listen to me, and keep clear of such a specious hypo- crite. It is a duty you owe to yourself and family.'- I felt the whole force of the remark, admitted .the j:lstice, and decided in favor of the verdict; but how to account for the change in my previous determination, was not sd easy to manage. "The day at length arrived, and with it Mr. Melbourne; a perfect gentleman in manner and appearance, without the slightest shadow that could give umbrage in any possible way. I was nevertheless determined not to like him, and trusted to chance for an opening to give him my opinion. He began the conversation by praising the little quiet spot where he felt sure he should be happy. I told him, very coolly, I was sure it would not suit him, and advised him to find some other. "He seemed as much astonished as one so perfectly well bred could be; and asked my reasons for supposing such a thing possible. "Of course I could give him none. He proceeded to give me a description of his own home in a far-off land; of the loved ones he had parted with, a few years before, in his inno- 2  cent and happy boyhood; of the superiority of his mother, idolized, and never forgotten, even in his most erring moments; of the stern integrity of his father, whose high-minded and honorable career he had failed to emulate. And then fol- lowed a brief but feeling description of his own character. I I' ',     28        CARRIE EMERSON. listened in silence. There was no attempt to gloss over or hide his errors. All that I had heard from the lips of one, whose motive for telling it, I was sure, had been to benefit me, not traduce him, was fully corroborated by his own statement. 'And what,' I asked, ' is your motive for coming here?' "' To find a quiet home and a true friend,' was the an- swer. "One thought of the boys, who were growing up to be thrown upon the world, as liable to fall a prey to its delusive flatteries, though safe enough at present, decided me. Who could tell where fate or fortune might lead them? Would God raise up a true friend in their hour of need? It was enough! I put far away the feeling of distrust and prejudice; and inly promised, as far as was in my power, to act the part of a faithful friend. "A few days after, I received a letter from the friend whose advice I had not taken, saying, that if I chose to admit Mr. Melbourne to my house, he should feel obliged to absent him- self from it. Of course such a letter required no answer. iHe was at liberty to do as he pleased; and, although I felt grieved to give up one whose sterling qualities merited un- qualified esteem, I did it cheerfully, for I felt that God was on my side. Now, here was a case, Carrie, that might have come under the head of scandal - some might think slander; but I never for a moment could look upon it in such a light. There was perfect sincerity, and I honored the noble, inde- pendent nature, that so firmly carried out its principles; although I always regretted that those two young men should not have met and become acquainted. For Melbourne, if he   CARRIE EMERSON.                     29 left one regret behind him, it was, .that perhaps we shall never meet again in this world of chances and changes. A more noble nature,-one more deserving the name of a perfect gen-  teman, or a highly valued friend,-I never knew. Time or circumstances will never change him. It is from such char- acters the true essence of friendship emanates. No matter how wide the ocean that separates, how high above worldly wealth or fame might raise such an one; the noble nature would not degenerate.  And yet there were only a few who understood and appreciated Mr. Melbourne. There were many all ready to calumniate; some, too, who professed friend- ship; more shame to them! There were a few who loved and valued him as he deserved. There is in such memories no room for regret. Would to Heaven there were more of them in the world! The sting of the slanderer has no power to wound or harm, if, in our unfaltering faith, we do not waver. I might give you many more illustrations, but it is needless. Your own innate sensibility will teach you whom to trust, and whom to shun. And when it fails you, dear Carrie, come to your mother." -ft3 8* 4 4s        CHAPTER III.

MOORE. "GooD-MOnNING, Mrs. Emerson! good-morning, Carrie! Where is Willie? I want to have some sport with him." "O, never mind Willie, Ed.! I want you to sing with me." i Well, sing away. What is it?" "I 'll hang my harp on the willow-tree."' "Fudge! no you won't do any such thing; and that re- minds me of something I heard yesterday, and I came over solely that you might enjoy the benefit of it with me."   CARRIE EMERSON           31 You are not as selfish as the generality of people, or you would be keeping it exclusively for yourself."    J "I could n't do that very well, seeing tha half of it be- longs to you, by right." W( ell, then; do give me my share." ", Why, I heard we were engaged, that's all. How should you like me for a lover, Carrie?" ( O, I like you very well in your present capacity,- friend of the family." "But if Mrs. Buncombe and two or three others have de- cided to have it so, what objection have you to make, pray?" "Go ask a certain young lady of your acquaintance." ( "No I won't. I am going to put Mrs. Buncombe in the way of enlightening her; it will give her employment. You know that' Satan finds some mischief still,'-don't you? Well I'm going to write a love-letter to you, and put it- in the office. She is mighty anxious to know if there is any truth in the supposition that. Carrie Emerson is engaged; who 2H: the gentleman is; where he is located, etc. Now, remember she'll get this letter, not you. I am going to say some extravagant things in it; among others, that I have got a lady love, but am getting tired of her,- as you must have seen long ago,- but did not like fo say so, because my father threat- ened to disinherit me;- of course, she's an heiress. Then, as a great secret, I 'll give you her name and residence,- fictitious, X  of course. Heavens, how the letters will fly! I shall manage it so they will all come into my hands, you know. Won't it ,:; be sport?" "O, Ed.! you shan't do any such thing." -A      32       CARRIE EMERSON. "Yes, I will, by George! if it's only to pay her for what she said about you." "I don't care for what she said; it won't hurt me. No one minds her; she is n't worth it." i( Well, I mistrust where some of your missing letters have gone; and, if you'll let me alone, I'll prove it to your satis- faction. I happen to know one of her confidential friends, who don't seem to have the most exalted opinion of her prin- ciples. Come, Carrie; you like me well enough for a lover, don't you?" O0, Ed.! are you bent on mischief?" "Not a bit of it. I'm going to have some glorious fun. Say, will you agree to it? You won't! Then I'll do it all myself. \  So mind you don't contradict anything you hear." "Now, let us sing, Ed.! 'I have learned to love another.'" That's it! Sing away, love! Don't that sound lover-like? But I must be off. Good-by, dear." Now, mother, what shall I do? Ed. 's just harum-scarum enough to do what he said. He don't consider that what is sport for him may be death to some one else. If I were certain he was engaged to Miss Macy, I 'd write her a letter, and put her. on her guard. If anything anonymous fell into her hands, she would know just what to make of it." No, let it all drop. He will forget it before he gets home." Did he forget it? We shall see.   CARRIE EMERSON.          33 A few days brought him again. Ever a welcome visitor, he was sure of a hearty greeting. "I want you to go and make a call with me, Carrie," he said. "It's a lovely day, and they have any quantity of fruit. It's out to Aunt Maria's. She 'll be delighted to see us, and feast us upon cream-cakes and custard-pies in abundance." So they rode over. The chaise had hardly turned from the door before a spec- ulation began. "Carrie Emerson riding out again! I wonder who she'll go with next?" said one. "I wonder who she 's gone with now?" said another. "I'll know who he is," said a third. Mean- time, Carrie and Edward have made the long-promised call; eaten of the fruit and cake; and, while they are enjoying themselves, we will, if you please, make a call or two in the ' neighborhood, and see how many, in plain terms, belong to the species called slanderers. Our first call is at a large old-fashioned house, where everything outside and in bespeaks comfort and cleanliness - two things wholly inseparable. In the large front parlor are quite a bevy of young ladies, busy as bees,-- their tongues, if not their needles. They have assembled to assist at a quilting; but, between you and I, gentle reader, I'm afraid that old lady who is adjusting her spectacles won't look quite so complacently to-morrow, when she sits down to remedyll ; the mischief done. (I mean to the quilt, of course.) She 'll find the " true lovyers knots," she's taking so much pains to draw on the smooth and even surface, have got sadly mixed up; and she 'll havm. to study some time to find out a right angle from a triangle, or anything else they are twisted into. And I imagine I hear her telling her daughter, Betsey, that )\     34       C A it R I E E I ER S O N. the next time she gets a quilt in, she 'll take care they shan't have a hand in it. She's very pleasant now, however; look- ing up, every now and then, and adding her testimony piece- meal, as she thinks requisite." t "Were you at meeting last Sabbath afternoon?" said Miss Harriet Stacy, to her next neighbor, Cora Leavitt. "I was. You must know I wouldn't stay away when Brother Spaulding preached (the young ladies were both members of the Methodist Church); and did you ever hear him preach a better sermon?" "I did n't hear or enjoy the sermon as I ought," said Har- riet. "I chanced to cast my eye up at the singers, and I saw something that took away all my pleasure in the service. I wish to mercy I had staid at home." "Why, what did you see?" said the wondering Cora. "See! Do tell me if you did n't see Mary Caldwell?" "See her? Yes, to be sure I did; and I saw, too, how deeply interested she was in the subject Brother Spaulding was so eloquently discussing; for, though her face was bright with smiles, her eyes were sparkling with tears." "Tears! She ought to shed tears, if it was only for the pain she occasioned me." "Do pray, Hattie, tell us what she did to you?" said half a dozen eager voices, whom the solemn face of Hattie had attracted froml the quilt. "Why, did n't a ou notice her bonnet?" "He bonnet!" responded the voices. "Her bonnet!" ex- claimed the old lady, letting fall her piece of chalk, and lboking up with a wondering countenance. "What ailed her bonnet? She did n't put it on hind side afore, did she?"A burst of   CARRIE EMERSON.          35 laughter drowned the voice of the indignant Hattie, and she looked half a mind to box the ears of one fair girl, particularly, ^? who had caught up a bonnet from the side-table, put it on in the style the old lady hinted at, and stood peering over the shoul- der of another, who, catching a glimpse of the comic figure and expression in an opposite glass, was vainly trying to sup- press the ready laugh. Harriet's sombre countenance, how- ever, soon put to flight the ill-timed merriment, and she said very feelingly, ' Mary Caldwell had a bow on her bonnet; and I think it a great pity that one, who might have been a burning and a shining light, should do anything to bring a reproach upon the cause. She is a young convert, and every-  body is looking to see hIw she will hold out." "O, pho, Hattie!" sid the soft voice of Cora. "I think you are altogether oet about such things. It is n't likely Mary would do anything to bring a reproach upon the cause, any more than you or I would. I never thought, before she professed religion, she cared much about dress, and Ishall ^ never believe it now, unless she displays something more than X a simple bow on her bonnet."    "I should n't be surprised if you were the next one to fall off," said Harriet somewhat tartly. tI wear my bonnet trimmed nuch lhore than Mary, now, Hattie." "W ell, you did n't make much change in your outward ap- pearance, Cora; scarcely enough to show to the world that I you are a professed follower of Christ." I had hoped that a meek and humble spirit would be a more efficient evidence." "I am afraid you and Mary will set a poor example. I wish, I '      36       CARRIE EMERSON. really, that you would consider how much occasion it gives for scandal; to say nothing of the pride you are fostering." IPride!" said a bright, happy-looking girl, who had been listening very intently, but who had not yet spoken. "Do you pretend to say that pride does not lurk as often under a plain dress, and a staid, sober countenance, as under - as under mine, for instance?" holding up the skirt of her dress tucked to the waist; " and that you do not take as much pains to make your hair becomingly plain, under the most approved fashion of your sect, as I do?" shaking her abundant curls - natural ones too - back from her face. A deep-drawn sigh seemed the only answer she wds likely to get, and Cora hoped in her heart Mary Caldwell's faull would be excused; but she was disappointed. "I am afraid that Henry Wallace is at the bottom of all Mary's short-comn ings," said Hattie in a subdued voice. "' Why so?" ventured some one. It was the only objection he made to her joininge church He thinks a good deal of the outward adorning; and some people are very much beholden to dress for their beauty after all." "Well, Mary Caldwell is n't, at any rate," said Cora; "( sh looks well let her have on what she will. I don't blame he for trying to please Henry. They are to be married soon, an I suppose she thinks, by conforming to his wishes in this, h will be more easily led to seek for happiness at the sam source where she has found it." "Another very wrong step she is taking. 'Be ye n unequally yoked,' is an injunction wholly overlooked in he case." sO   *^ J CARRIE EI ERSON.          37 I. I wish," said a tantalizing young lady, who, from being related, was, or thought herself, privileged to say anything that came into her head,'( that you had been fortunate enough to a get a beau before you got religion, cousin Hattie. 'I'd'like to see if you would give him up for such a slight cause. No', no, cousin Hattie! we should see two or three bows finding their way on to your bonnet,--one at a time, of course; but, :' they would all get there. And your hair,lat will crinkle, all you can do, would manage to curl after a while. Don't look so determined ; it's too late, cousin Hattie;" and a pro- voliing laugh cheeced the solemn reproof that was framing K  itself in the mind of Hattie. "Have you been to see poor Ellen Grant lately? They say she fails very fast." (I was there last week," said one voice; "but she did n't seem inclined to say much, and I thought I would not go again." "She coughs almost incessantly; I suppose that was one reason." "'Do you know anything about her circumstances, Hattie'?" (t "No, I do not. I called once, and tried to impress upon her mind her danger if she died in her sins." i "Died in her sins!" exclaimed the curly-headed cousin; * "   why, who ever heard of such an impious charge? I've been to school to her ever since she has been in Cliftonville; and 4  I thought, when she died, she would go right straight to heaven." We are all sinners, Annie," said our old lady, who had /  only now got over her surprise 'about the bonnet. "Don't i  your Bible tell you so, dear?" 4     38       CARRIE EMERSON. "I know something else it tells us, Mrs. Maynard." "( What is it, dear?" "' Judge not, lest ye be also judged.' I hope, when I come to die, I shall have no more to repent of than Ellen Grant." ( She is out of the fold of Christ," said Harriet, sternly; "consequently she is a sinner, and as such needeth repentance and submlission to fit her for the approaching change. ' Unles ye repent, ye can in nowise enter into the kingdom o heaven.' Is that not enough to condemn her, I ask?" "No, cousin Hattie; I don't care a fig for your set phrases, or all your pious denunciations together. I say Ellen Grant is a good, noble-hearted, whole-souled, high-minded Christian, - yes, Christian! I will say it, because I know it. I held my peace just now when Mary was being scrutinized; for I don't know her very well, and I don't care. But, Nelly-it 's altogether a different affair. She's my fiiend ;--and do you really think she will die?"She hid her face in her hands and burst into tears. ( There 's not much hope of her, Annie," said Cora, sooth- ingly, her own eyes filling with tears. "But I am glad to hear you do her justice. She deserves all you have said." ?-'Who pays her expenses now she is sick? Her friends, I believe, are all at a distance, -if, indeed, she has any,which no one knows for a certainty,--and probably they are poor; else she would not teach. Do you know, Iattie?" "I do not," said Hattie. "We might make up a purse for her. It would only be doing our duty, like good Samaritans. But who would present it to her? It is rather a delicate subject, as, after all, we are not sure that she is destitute."   CARRIE EMER KSON .         39 "'0, any of us ought to be willing! I 'll collect it; and I dare say Annie or Cora will be happy to be the bearer." i I shall do no such thing," said Annie, indignantly. "She would not accept it, if I so far forgot myself as to be the bearer of any such contribution. If Ellen needed assistance she would not scruple to say so. But she has looked out for a rainy day, and she is too proud to be the recipient of any one's bounty, who would condemn her so severely and unscrupulously." "O, Annie!. all this comes of reading such books as you have been accustomed to! You get false ideas of the world and its follies. You can hardly be thought a competent judge, if you let outward appearances gloss over a want of true -, Christian faith." "I don't care half as much for the faith, as I do for trie charity, - yes, the charity, Hattie, - that will cover a multi- tude of sins. O, pshaw!" she said, evidently getting impa- tient. "I don't like your ideas of religion. They are too gloomy and sectarian. I shall have to go and sit an hour with Ellen to-night, to get rid of the cold chill you have : thrown ovr, me." ".hLYgo with you, Annie," said Cora, softly. "I want to :. be better acquainted with Ellen. I always liked her, spite of the cool reserve with which she shrouds herself. It always '- seemed put on to suit the company she was in." " "If they all happened to be on a par with cousin Hattie, I don't wonder. Ellen has a great deal of calm dignity in her manner; she says it is requisite in her vocation. But she is sweet-tempered and affectionate, and has high and holy prin-     40        CAR 1 IE EME U SON. ciples in her nature, which she lives up to, in the fullest sense of the word." "' Carrie Emerson is quite a favorite with her; I often meet her in Ellen's sick-room." ( Yes, Carrie is a kindred spirit. I know E]llen enjoys her society; she is a noble-heartecd girl, if they do say she 's a co- quctte. I suppose she would cmle in for a share of Hattie's pious judgnlctt; but she would n't merit it a bit more than Ellen does." ( Where 's Mrs. Maynard? I want her to chalk out some mlorec." ( She 's out helping to get tea." (I hope she 'll give us something good; don't you? I think we 've richly earned it. My fingers will be sore for a week. When I 'm married I won't have a patchwork quilt in the house. I think they are horrid vulgar." ( O, Hester! I heard you praising this very quilt when we first came in ; you .said it was the prettiest one you'd seen for a long time, land )you eanl to put one together just like it." Something like a blush stole over the cheek of the con- scious Hester, alnd she half turned round to avoid her com- panion's scrutinizingl glances. It was but a moment, however, the twinge lasted; for, as she reached across the quilt for the spool of cotton, she said, half audibly, "I wonder i' Mrs. Maynard puts ginger in her pumpkin pies. See there," directing her glance through the half-open door; "they look first-rate; and true as you live she's got In- dian cake for supper." O, hold your tongue, Hester! that's diet bread, and it's   CARRIE EMERSON.           41 first-rate too. I've taken tea here before, and everything was nice. Mrs. Maynard is a good cook." "Well, all I wish is that she 'd make haste. I 'm really ;  faint; and seems to me I could have got tea in half the time." ( I don't wonder," half-whispered a pretty girl, who had left her work, and, with another, was carelessly turning over the leaves of a book; "if all stories are true, Hester's lmo ther is mean enough. They have a hard time to make two ends meet. Her father is out of health, and they have to contrive all ways to keep up appearances; but, for all that, they 're as proud as Lucifer. I don't see how they do it - do you?" It was to Annie Lee she spoke; there was no answer. "Why don't you say something, Annie? or are they par- ticular friends of yours?" For the simple. reason that I have nothing to say. I never trouble myself about my neighbors." "Well, that's more than they can say. They talk about everybody.  I should nt wonder if you got your share amongst the rest." A summons to tea caused a generfl movement, and while they are discussing its merits, we will take a peep at another group. Two lovely girls are sitting in a quied chamber, diligently sewing upon a light morning wrapper. They are so busy that they scarcely notice the appearance of their mother, a very digiified-looking lady; one who apparently had not al. ways lived in her present limited style, but who was a great stickler where pride was concerned. "Are you here, George?" turning to her son, who, deeply interested in his book, had not looked up. "I thought you    42       C A r R  I  E ERSON. were going to spend the evening with the Blakes. If you play your cards well, you may marry the heiress, Miss Mur- ray; they say she is worth a hundred thousand, and she'll be of age in a few months. They say she likes young Peirce; but you could easily cut him out; he's a conceited fop." "I wish you would not make such ridiculous speeches, mother. I told you once, and now I repeat it, I do not want Miss Murray, or her money either. I would n't lhave her if she was worth her weight in gold!" "And why not, pray?" "For the simple reason that I don't want her. If she likes Ned Peirce, let her have him ; there will be two fools together then." "I a a shamwed of you, George! It is too good an oppor- tunity to be thrown away. You might please her if you tried. A little flattery would turn the scale decidedly." "I want a sensible woman for my wife, mother!" "I wonder where you 'll find one?" "O, I know where to find one! There are plenty of them round." ( Colec, George, you had better go." O, don't urge him, mother dear!" said the youngest sister, looking up with an affectionate glance; "see, we have almost finished our work, and he has promised to walk over to Ellen Grant's with us." "Ellen Grant, indeed! Pray, what are you doing?"-she asked rather tartly. "I hope you have n't been fooling away your money on her, Agnes. Why, they say she's in a quick consulmption. What does she want of new dresses?" "I did n't give her the dress, mother. She thought it   ^'. C A I R I IE EIMESON.              43 would be more cool and comfortable made this way, and she asked me to buy it for her the other day, when I was out shopping. I called in to-day, after school, and saw how weak and tremulous her fingers were, as she worked on it, and I offered to take it home and do it for her." "Why don't her relations come and take her home, I should like to know?" "She has a step-mother, and sisters; and I rather think they don't want her there." "Well, I see no need of your calling upon her quite so often. She 's a poor nobody, without doubt; and you know I have always been particular what company you kept." "O, mother! if you knew her as well as Agnes and I do, you would not speak so slightingly of her. She may be poor, but she 's not to be despised for that. Is she, Agnes?" "No, indeed, Amy. And she's not one to be put down by the sneers of the world; there's too huchh merit in her coin- position for that. And as to pride - why, mother, she's got just as much pride and dignity as you have." Only a different way of showing it," chimed George. An angry flash from his mother's dark eye was his only answer, as she flounced out of the room, muttering, "If, as I half suspect, he's getting interested in her, there is nothing to fear. Thank the Lord, she's going to die! And as to Agnes and Amy, I 'll take care how they associate with school-mistresses in future, if it's going to end in such disin- terested attachments. George, too, will see' the day when he'll wish he'd taken his mother's advice." Poor woman  some hard rubs iith the world had probably hardened her heart to all the most kindly sensibilities of her nature.     CHAPTER IV.

Remember it is music's law, Each pure, true note, though low you sound it, Is heard through discord's wildest war Of rage and madness storming round4t.  Serenely go your glorious way, Secure that every footstep onward Will lead you from their haunts away; Since you go up, and they go downward. FRANCES OSGOOD. "DID you get a letter from me yesterday, Carrie?" "A letter from you, Ed.! No, inlldld,  said not," said Carrie, with a look of wonder, wholly forgetting that young gentleman's previous arrangement. All right, my dear; I did n't mean you should; the plan works to a charm."   CARRIE   EiMERSON.        45 "O, I had forgotten all about your scheming, Edward!" "Just like you! Forgot we were lovers, too, did n't you? I feel highly flattered, Miss Emerson." "I could n't very well forget what never was." "What never was?  Have n't -ve been lovers ever since we were knee high? Did n't I fight all your little school-girl battles? and don't you remember our first party? Did n't I threaten to whip Charlie Harding if he dared to redeem his pawn by kissing Carrie Emerson, hey? Come, own up, Carrie. Are we not lovers after the approved acceptation?" I I'm sure I don't know, so will not pretend to say, Ed- ward." ( Edward! I suppose it will be Mtr. Ashley next. Come, Carrie, woI't you tell me what's the matter this morning?" '"There is n't anything very particular to tell; only some folks are just silly enough to imagine that a young lady can't take a ride, or make a call upon a friend, with a young gen- tleman, but she 's engaged to him." "' O, that's it, hey! Well, now that's just as it should be. Did n't I ask you how you'd like me for a lover? and did n't you say --  ?" "IPho, Ed.! I did n't say anything to it." "Well it's all understood between you and I, dear. That sounds lover-like, any way. Come, if others are silly, no need of your being so too. Cheer up; all's well that ends well. Everything I undertake turns out first-rate. I'm one of For- tune's favorites." 5 "She may serve you a shabby trick, nevertheless." "I don't care if she does, as long as you and I are good friends. When Henry gets home I 'll tell him all about it, and he 'll enjoy the joke as much as we shall."     "I "       CARR IE EMERSON. A deep sigh and a gloomy fit of abstraction followed, and  Edward, finding her rather a moody companion, turned his  bright, sunny face to Mrs. Emerson. "I went to the new church yesterday afternoon."      i- "Did you? How did you like?" "O, very much indeed! I wish I could give you a descrip-  f tion of the sermon. I'd walk five miles any day to listen to such an one; and I believe Annie Lee had something to do with it." "Annie Lee! how, pray?"  "I don't know. I sat near their pew, however, and, from the variations in her countenance, I think she took uncom- mon interest. You recollect Sarah Elton?" "Yes; what of her?" "Well, she was with Annie, and her countenance indicated deep interest, also. You know for a long time she has been laboring under great depression of spirit. Her mind had become so imbued with the doctrine of predestination, that it seemed a waste of time to argue the point with her. She not  ; only seemed inclined to believe it fully, but to hug up the belief that she was born to perdition. The burden of her  story was: ' It is of no kind of use; if I am destined to be  lost, of what use is preaching? of what use striving? of what use faith?' When Mr. S. first commenced, her face  wore the most gloomy expression I ever saw; every now andi then a tear would steal softly down, and she would brush it  gently away, never taking her eyes off his face for a moment.; No ray of hope seemed to gladden her; though, at times,   ;" Annie's face sparkled all over. At length, when he had drawn his sermon to a close, and was about to pronounce the benediction, he said, turning his  ;! ,!

Don't walk or make the least exertion yourself; if you are to get there you will.' ("I kept my eye on Sarah; I had been pretty sure before, and I heard Annie say, ' (Come, Sarah, try it; I 'll stay with you.' "' A bright smile lit up Sarah's face as she passed out of the pew, and making her way towards the altar waited until Mr. S. came down. ile came towards them, looking very much gratified; and as I passed them I heard Annie say, ' I knew you could do it.' I did n't hear the answer, but I could imagine it. Who would think Annie Lee would take such an interest?" "I should; she 'll make a noble-minded woman." "I met her the other afternoon going up to Mrs. Moody's. They are very poor, you know, and somebody has sent them a quantityofcalico for children's dresses. I could n't imagine what Annie was going there for, and I asked her;' but she would n't tell me. IWell, I found out afterwards that she had been there two whole days sewing for them, and, besides that, took home some to work on at her leisure. What do you think of that?" "I think, as I ever have, she 's a noble-hearted girl." "Yes," said William, (" and Bob Moody said you sent 'em a load of wood, Ed.; and your father let 'ema live in his house a whole year for nothing. I tell you they feel rich now." "You little nimshine! you must n't tell all you know. Why, I'll have you put in the post-office."     48        CARRIE  EMERSON. .  "If you will, Ed., I 'll take care nobody gets your letters, and mother's, and Carrie's. But why must n't I tell what  you did? You told all about Annie." No I did n't, Willie. Somebody said, no longer ago than  yesterday, that Annie was a coquette, andf that shle was even trying to get round the minister; but, if I were to judge, he is trying to get round her. At any rate, they are firmil friends."  "Harriet Stacy would call that scandal," said Carrie; "and to make her believe it possible, Annie would have to cut off all her curls." "Annie would n't be such a fool," said Ed. laughing;   : "she believes, as we do, they were given her for ornament. I must go now; and do Carrie get off that long face before I come again. If you don't, I shall flit some fine morning in search of one who, I fear, needs to have his memory jogged." . Henry's silence is indeed very mysterious," said Mrs. Emerson. "There has never before been the slightest irregu- larity in their correspondence. Others have heard from him since we have; so, of course, he is well;:" "I would n't care, Carrie; there are as good fish in the sea as ever were caught. I 'd tell him so if I were you. I 'll  make some inquiries." "O don't, for pity's sake, Ed.! I would n't have him think I cared so much about him."  "How good Ed. is, mother! I often think how proud I should be of him if he were my brother. There is in him,  too, such a fund of good sense, he can scarcely fail to please. I don't believe he has scarcely an enemy in the world." ' Yes, Carrie, the creature of impulse most truly; made  r                        *  ':   CARRIE  EIMERSON.         49 up of all the elements of nature in their purest, noblest state; untainted by selfishness, untarnished by sin. His light, vola- tile spirits may sometimes lead him astray, but he will nlever go far from the beaten track. As you say, he can scarcely fail to make friends, and he is just the one, too, to make enemies. His upright, honest, independent nature, so ready to fly in the face of wrong or deceit, will call up all sorts of resentful feelings; but time will teach him best how much it is necessary to subdue in his intercourse with the world." "I guess he likes to come here," said Willie, "because you and Carrie like him, and don't run him down as Lu. Eldrich does."  "O, Willie, that's a mistake! Lu. likes him, I know. Be- sides, what can she say against him?" "No it isn't a mistake, miss; I guess I know.. I was there helping Franky spin his top, and she was talking about Ed. to Miss Hammet; and she said he liked to step round amongst the girls, but that she would n't be seen with him; and she said she supposed his father would set him up in business, but he was so wild he wouldn't attend to it; and then she said he was too proud to associate with common folks, and she 'd like to know who he was, to set himself "I got mad then, and I told her he was Mr. Edward Ash- ley! and if he'wanted to be proud it was n't anybody's busi- ness. She was real mad at first, and said she was a mind to box my ears; and then she brought me two big apples, and  said she did n't notice I was in the room, or she should nit have said so; and said I must never tell of it."   50       CARRIE EMERSON. "O, how ridiculous! and they are so fair to his face when-  ever they chance to meet him! I wish I had been there;   I they should n't talk about Ed. before me."        ': Carrie's indignation would have been roused still more, had she listened to the following: "There goes Edward Ashley again. I wonder what he finds so interesting at the Emersons. He 's there just about half his time. If I were you, Lu., I 'd set my cap, and see if I could n't catch him." "I suppose it is Miss Caroline. What is there, for pity's sake, so very attractive about her? Why, he don't pretend  to hide his preference at all. They walk, ride, and visit together, just as much 'as if they were engaged. I don't believe he knows a word about Henry Irving." "Well, Henry Irving knows something about him, Lu.; and if he don't now, he will soon, depend upon it." ( California is a long way off," said Lu., musingly; "there may be a great deal going on here that he 'll never be the wiser for." "News travels faster than we think sometimes. There is enough said about Ashley; queer if he did n't hear some of it."  He 's a wild, harum-scarum fellow; says anything that comes uppermost. Fool if he don't like to go to the Emer-  : sons! They are always so delighted to see him, and so anxious to gratify and please him, and so sorry when he goes out of town for a few weeks, and so rejoiced when he comes back again  O, dear! is n't it sickening?" "Yes, it is; but who can blame him? Carrie Emerson is   CARRIE EMERSON.          51 a regular coquette; she 'd be angry enough if she knew I said so; but she is, for all that." "Well, you just wait a while. She hasn't heard from Henry Irving for some time; and, if I 'm not mistaken, it will be some time yet before she 'll get a letter, and- when she does get one, she'll wear a longer face than she does now, I'll promise you." "He 's coming home before long, I believe." "Folks alter their minds sometimes, Lu. I shouldn't wonder if he staid away a long time to come." ( What a good thing it is to have two strings to your bow! If Henry should happen to hear that she?- was flirting with another now, and give. her up,ishe could afford to lose him pretty well, seeing his loss would be abundantly made up by the universal favorite."    \ "' I don't know about Ashley's-be inig a universal favorite. You ought to have heard the run he. got the other evening at Mrs. Smyth's. 1I tell you theydidai't spare him much. They say he's forever getting himself into' mischief." "I don't see how; he always seems ready to defend the absent ones, whether they deserve it-or not; makes no scru- ple of telling a person he hates busy-bodies, as much as i'fhe thought they were such." "That is what the Emersons call candor. I wonder. if they 'd be as charitable if it were you or I?" "And I wonder, if you or I Oere to do what Carrie did the other evening at Bel Atherton's party, if he would think it just the thing?" "Why, what did-she do?" "I can't tell who told her, but some tattling thing did.  52        CARRIE EMERSON. that Lizzie Somers talked about her. Now, I don't suppose Lizzie said any more than we are saying now; and if she did, no doubt she deserved it. Well, they hadn't met for some tinme,- Lizzie, you know, has been out of town,-and she hurried up to Carrie with a sweet smile, and was going to give her a kiss of welcome -when, what does Carrie do but fold her hands, draw coolly back, and, with a very dignified goo(d-evli g,' pass on. Ed. Ashley was close by, and the wicked imp bit his lip almost till the blood came, and made the most of a very slight cause to indulge in a merry laugh. I knew all the time it was at poor Lizzie's expense, and I could have turned him  out of the room with a good will." "Did any one else notice it?" "Yes, every one.' "What did they say?" ( O, they said it was too bad, and all that sort of thing, among themselves; but that did n't mend the matter any." "How did they get over it?" "Lizzie's enjoyment was, of course, spoilt; but Carrie did n't care a copper; she carried it out in the coolest man- ner. I told her mother of it next day. I really thought she ought to know it." t low did she feel about it?" "She listened very complacently until I got through, and merely said, ' Carrie did perfectly right; busy-bodies ought to expect such treatment.' Last evening they happened to meet again; and Lizzie, who is very sensitive, soon took leave. After she was gone, one of the young ladies took it 1 i   CARRIE EMERSON.           53 upon herself to expostulate with Carrie. I wish you had been there. Really, Caroline Emerson is not at a loss for words; and, as to their candor, goodness!- there's no lack of it in her composition." "I wish somebody would tell Ashley a good story; do it in a covert way, so he wouldn't suspect, and get him against them. Would n't it be capital sport? They 're a proud set. They don't care a fig for the generality of opinion; it is only a chosen few they deign to trust and love, and for them there is an inner sanctuary; perfect confidence and unqualified es- teem is the order there. O, how I should like to throw out a hint or two both to them and Ashley!" "You had better not; it would n't have the least impres- sion upon them, and, more than likely, they'd read you a lecture upon slanderers, and shun you afterwards as if you belonged to that hateful species." "You should have been at Susan's the other evening, and heard what I did; you would find that Ed. Ashley knows how to get out of mischief as well as in." "What was the trouble there, pray?" / "Why, Laura Wilson had been getting up a new flirtation, and somebody told Ashley a story about it. Well, I dare say it was all true as a book, and he did n't doubt it more than I do. It got out somehow; and, although Ashley had never repeated a word of what he had heard, her uncle, Mr. Leslie, insisted upon it he had, and he threatened to prosecute. Mr. Ashley refused to implicate any one, and did his best to make peace. But no; Leshe was determined to have it all his own way, and make Ashley pay the cost of what did not concern him in the least. We all know Ashley is rich, and don't care 5          :     54        ARRIE EM3ERSON. for money; but he had no idea of being so shamefully imposed upon. So he told Mr. Leslie, in pretty plain terms,  just what he thought of both hinn4d Miss Laura, and dared them to trouble him any more abutithe matter."  ' And what do you think will be the end of it?" (The end has already come. Laura packed up, and was off yesterday in the first train. Probably she thought the  news would travel, if she didn't; and her intended might take it into his head to listen to Mistress Rumor." "But how came you to hear it, Mary?" "I was in the next house; the windows were open, and I  heard every word. Mrs. Benson was there, and they treated her shamefully. For all she is always so kind to them in sick- ness, they didn't spare her feelings a bit."  "Well, she's most too candid; and if I were Mrs. Leslie, I would n't have her meddle in such affairs. How came she to be mixed up in it?" O, she told somebody what she had seen, and they sent for her. I only wish you had been there to hear the old lady :i defend herself, and bbast of how she had brought her daugh-  ters up. I wonder if there's anything remarkable about  them!" "Remarkable, pshaw! I heard Mrs. Emerson praising them the other day to a lady who is visiting there. She called  them the prettiest girls in Cliftonville, and told how partic- ular their mother had always been about whom they associated with, and all that sort of thing. Pretty! thinks I to myself, as I imagined the result might be a couple of old maids in the family."  "That 's just what Lizzie Somers says."   CARRIE EMERSON.           55 "Lizzie Somers! why, I thought Lizzie and Clara were firm friends."  "And so they are, as the world goes; but there are others around here Lizzie thinks as much of as Clara Benson. She has made so many professions of unalterable friendship, how- ever, that she dares not show what she. thinks; she knows the old lady's wrath would be down upon her if she did." "Mercy! is she so afraid of the widow Benson as that? Well, it's lucky there's one in the neighborhood who don't care for her." "Hush, Mary! there she is this'moment, and I really believe she's going to call here;" "How do you do, Mrs. Benson?" said the silvery voice of Lu. The young - lady was called Loiza -by the old folks at home, but the diminutive was better suited to the little fairy figure that so gracefully came .forward to welcome the lady in whom she is just now so much interested, to- seat in the best rocking-chair, and overwhelm with kind inquiries, - her own health, that of her family, etc. She has quite forgotten to call her mamma until an inquiry brings it to mind, and then she apologizes so sweetly, and begs Mrs. Benson will attribute it to what it really is, the unexpected pleasure of the visit. Mary, in the mean time, knowing Mrs. Benson detested seeing a young lady after a certain hour of the day in disha- bille, and that her curl-papers were not very becoming, had made good her retreat, and was arraying herself in some haste (as Mrs. B. never made long -calls), and she was anx- ious to let her know that she had overheard the conversation at Mr. Leslie's the other evening.  56       CARRIE EMERSON.  "Why, Lu.!" she exclaims, as she glides softly across the room with extended hand; "why didn't you let me know dear Mrs. Benson was here? I declare, the sight of you is really refreshing. I did n't know but that spiteful woman, Mrs. Leslie, had quite annihilated you."  "Why, how in the world did you ear of that, Mary? I was cautious not to mention it. I don't like to have my name mixed up in any such foolish affair." "Of course not. I was spending the evening in the next house, and happened to overhear it. I thought they treated you shamefully. I suppose you don't like to say anything, but I would like to know, -and, depend upon it, it shall go no further, - who you think was most to blame. Was n't it  Ashley?"           ? "No," said Mrs. Benson, very decidedly; ( it was not Mr. Ashley. I believe all he had to do with it was listening to the first version of the story. He denied repeating it; and  he told the truth, if I 'm any judge of candor."  "Then who was the one, Mrs. Benson? Of the two, he   i seemed the guiltiest. I only ask for Laura's sake. I think it right to defend-my own sex." "Defend your own sect, Mary! I hope you have n't joined the scandal-mongers!" said Mrs. Benson, in a tone so purely divested of sarcasm, it would have been treason to doubt it. "Horrible!" ejaculated Mary. "You misunderstood the word. I said sex!" "Humph!" said the old lady. "I fear, in too many  instances, the terms are synonymous." "Why, what a sweeping assertion!" said Mary, who i   CARRIE EMERSON.          57 longed to prove to Lu. her fearlessness of Mrs. Benson, yet trembled in her shoes lest she. was venturing upon dangerous ground. "Do you think there are no male specimens belong- ing to the sect you had reference to? ' , Plenty of them, my dear Mary; but I 'll never believe yotlng Mr. Ashley belongs o it."' "And why not?" said the sweet voice of Lu. "You -are not as well acquainted as Mary and I. Now, I like him very much indeed, but I 'm not so blind to his faults as some peo- ple are." "*If that means me," said Mrs?. Benson, ', I beg leave to inform ygu that I do not constitute myself a judge, never having been introduced to him before that evening, and then under very embarrassing circumstances." "Well, did n't he put a bold face upon the matter?" "If I might judge, his candor, not his boldness, gained the mastery, and silenced his opponents. He is eloquent, too, Mary, and chooses his words well." "Silenced, but not convinced them, Mrs. Benson. I heard what was said after you both left. If I were to tell. all I heard, Ashley would be the one to prosecute; but I won't, for, if Lu. likes him, it is more than I do; besides, it would only be making more mischief." , : "That 's right, sary; a still tongue shows a wise head. I came upon an important errand," said the lady rising. "Clara is to be married next Thursday evening, and I came to ask you in a social way to be present. We are not going to make a wedding,--only the family; but I thought as you were near neighbors, and about her own age too, I would like to have you come."  -I 58       CARRIE EMERSON. " dear! we shall be delighted," said both sisters. "But do tell us, is n't it very sudden? Why, we did n't know she had the least idea of being married; if we had, we should have come in and offered to assist her. She must have had a great deal to do." "Thank you just as much as if you had," said Mrs. Ben- son, politely. "It Is not at all sudden. Clara has been all the spring getting ready, and her sisters have helped her." "Strange we never heard a word of it; we generally hear all the news there is stirring in this quiet place." "We don't like to have our affairs bandied about," said Mrs. Benson, pointedly. "O, we shan't say anything; we never do." "Good-morning! Come early; remember, no ceremony." "Now, Lu.," said Mary Eldrich, as the door closed upon her visitor, "just tell me what you think of that. Clara Benson going to be married! Te11 me 't is n't sudden! Does her mother think to throw dust in our eyes?" "  How mean, not to invite us earlier! -barely time to get ready. How nicely she put in, too, about our ages! I sup- pose she thought it quite a triumph for Clara to be married first. She must remember that people who marry young, and in haste, are apt to repent at their leisure. I 'll keep my eye on them, Lu.; I like to watch the progress of affairs." "I know what I'd do; I'd have a wedding if I did n't have anything to offer but brown bread; it looks so mean! But, then, I don't suppose they could afford it." "We can tell better after we have had a peep at the inte- rior. Clara Benson! I declare, if it was n't for the satisfac- tion of seeing for one's self, I wouldn't go near them; I   ' CARRIE EMERSON.           59 know it will be a perfect bore. But there, if we staid away they 'd think it was done to slight them." "I dare say they would, and I would n't like to hurt their feelings. They can't help being poor; honest poverty is no disgrace." "I'm glad to hear you say so, my dear," said Mrs. Eld- rich, who had just come in, and had only heard the con- eluding remark. "Always live up to the principles you advocate." "Don't we, mamma?" said both voices at once. Mrs. Eldrich did not answer, her attention being called away at the moment; so I'll answer for you, young ladies. I think youz do.    CHAPTER V.

Soft buzzing slander; silkygmoths, that eat An honest name. THOMPSON'S LIBERTY. "GLORIOUS, glorious scenery! Was there ever anything in nature more beautiful than that?" said a subdued voice. "We long for the far-off and the unattainable. Why do we not oftener enjoy what is within our reach? Why not realize what is so superlatively beautiful?" Can I describe it? I'll try, reader mine. I have sat often in the self-same place, and my mind has revelled in the same luxuriant abundance of wild, romantic, scenic land- scape. On the very brow of a beetling rock, crowned by richest verdure, and covered on every side with moss, and fir, and   CARRIE EMERSON.           61 trembling pine, springing out from fissures and crevices in- numerable, where the wild-rose climbs with its perfume, without fear of being uprooted; for, though nature has been bountiful exceedingly, and spread thick the soil, and sprinkled it with untold beauty, the foundation is solid, and defies in- novation. And there, for miles and miles, you may gaze on the ever- varying scenery. Hill and dale, mountain and valley, stream and ocean, all mingled in promiscuous, but magnificent dis- play. Down at its foot dashes on one side a miniature cata- ract, foaming and tumbling over ragged rocks, and the broken gateway of a ruined mill, where nothing ever enters, save the deep-toned echo of the wandering waters, as they dash on to a broader bed, the light feathery foam dancing up among the slender tree-tops. A little further on lies the quiet village, looking in its dream-like serenity like a bird's rest, half hidden by the foliage so beautiful and bright. Another side, and we trace the windings of a silvery stream, gliding noiselessly as a serpent among green fields, and dark shaded spots of woodland, magnificent in their wild, untrained, diversified beauty. Away to the right stretches the broad Atlantic. Listen to the roar of the breakers; to the lashing of the sandy beach; to the rolling surge on the rock-boundc shore; to the ripling of its sleeping waters; and you have listened to the most glorious strain in nature's most sublime melody. One more feature, and the picture is complete, - the setting sun, viewed from that lovely spot; and we may well doubt, if Italia's sky can boast more splendor. The scene and the hour, shall I give it you in verse? 6     (2     CCARRIE EM URSON. O, how beautiful the hour, when the gorgeous daylight dies, And the last expiring sunbeam lights up the western skies; When the rainbow-tinted drapery is like t curtain drawn, And the hush of evening wears a charm far holier than the dawn! O, glorious in his majesty, when he ushers in the day, And the bright glad face of nature is basking 'neath his ray; When the low perpetual hum is lost in the Iyriad host that sings, And the incense-laden air goes up to greet the King of kings! There is beauty in the tracery of every fleecy cloud, That seeks with gentle softness his fiery beams to shroud; But of every varying hour, that o'er earth's surface flies, There is none so truly beautifrt as when the daylight dies. "Is there anything to mar this glorious scenery?" said Carrie Emerson, as she sat, with a little group of friends, upon the summit of Sunset Rock.  "I almost dread to see the lengthened siadow falling beneath us. O, mother! how I love this spot!" "I do not wonder," said the same soft voice that had first spoken, and whose admiration had been almost eloquently silent. "I have rambled with your mother ever since my ear- liest recollection, seeking here a flower, and there a gem, as far as our limited means would permit; but never before did I see aught like this. No wonder you love the spot, Carrie. What could mar the beauty of a scene like this?" "O, Annette!" said Carrie, " it would make you shudder to sit here, when the driving scud and the fitful blast swept by you, and you knew the fearful tempest was near at hand. I 've seen many a shattered vessel strew this beach. I 've helped bring back to life the half-drowned mariner. I 've seen a noble ship go down with its living freight; so near the   CARRI  EEMERSON.         63 shore, too, as to hear their wild shrieks for mercy. A. little further down this smooth silvery stream has lain for many years a sunken wreck. We often anchor our boat, and fish directly above it; and, further down, we can see beneath the smooth surface many a ragged rock, that would strike terror to our hearts could we see them when the sea was raging round and over them. To-morrow we'll go all round the shore; and, if cousin Henry will go with us, we 'll show you the very spot where they saved the remnant of that ill-fated band of emigrants. Will you go, Henry?" "Go! yes. But, I want to ask you a. question. 'In your reply to Annette's question, of what could mar the beauty of a scene like this, you have pictured the mighty tempest in its desolating career. Sad and fearful as it is, can it be said to mar the beauty? Methinks it gives force and richer color- ing; might .and majesty intermingled. It is but the deeper shading to some sunlit, gorgeous painting." "You are right, Henry," said Mrs. Emerson, looking up at the animated face bending over them. "Were it always calm and peaceful we could never realize aught save the beauty. The power that rideth on the whirlwind is necessary to make it'grand, sublime!" "How much it is like human nature, too!" said Henry. I hardly know how to express what I mean; but you will understand me. The misunderstanding between my friend Julian and myself, a few days since, was necessary to the. perfecting of our friendship. I did not know him, or he me, before. It brought out the hidden strength of the soul. The flash of the tempest lit up the whole structure. Where I deemed him tame, I knew him powerful; and, when the storm     "       CARRIE EMERSON                a subsided, I loved him all the better for the strength of mind developed. Not that I would advocate quarrelling as necessary  to reveal what is in the inner sanctuary; but some- pictures need a master-spirit to give the finishing touch to their beauty. And it was so with him. He needs something to bring out the deep feeling hidden under the calm, stoical exterior." "Of whom are you speaking?" said a young gentleman, who had strolled away from the group in quest of berries. "Of Julian Percy."  "Julian Percy, hey? Do you want to know what I think of him? Well, I 'll tell you. I think him a perfect enigma. I suppose I am as well acquainted with him as any of you; but I am as far as ever,. I believe, from reading his character in its true light. Whlat dlo you think, Gracie?" O, mercy! I should hardly dare express my opinion. In fact, I do not think I have any to express. I would n't run the risk of being spell-bound by those wondrous eyes of his, if I must study his character from his face." True windows of the soul, Grace," said Mrs. Emerson. "I have been studying his character for the last six months, and I think I have fathomed his soul." And what is he, Mrs. Emerson?" "He is my friend, Graci! Is not that enough to assure you that, if I have discovered faults, I can speak of them to none but himself? and it would break the bond between us were I to trumpet his virtues to the world." "But is n't he hard to fathom?" "Very, very hard; but one of the few who might well  repay the trouble." (I cannot help it, if he is your friend, Mrs. Emerson;   CAR  IE EMERSON.          65 I'm afraid, when he is fairly launched upon his career in life you know he 's only vegetating now), his course will be, met- aphorically speaking, rather meteoric." "It may be erratic, Allan, but there will flash out at in- tervals a true light, strong enough for its redeeming. Do not let us discuss his character, Allan; I may be wrong in my ver- sion of it. Let time reveal." "You are afraid he 'll prove but common clay." "Not afraid; there is a conviction in my own soul, which will never be overcome,- and he knows it well,- that, let him sin as he will, there are some noble traits that will escape pollution." "Thank you, my dear eousin," said the deep-toned voice of Henry Moore. "In Julian's stead I thank you for the faith you have in his future. Were it not a breach of honor, I would repeat this conversation, just to show him what a sin- cere friend he has in my cousin Lucy." "There is no need, Henry; he does not doubt it. He will make but few friends," she added with a sigh. "It must be so from, the reserve beneath which he shrouds himself; but those few will be firm ones, for they will. have to know him well. In such a case they cannot fail to love him as he deserves." "Then you think the icicle can be thawed?" said the / light-hearted Allan. "Why, all eyes are upon him in the ball-room. The young ladies, bowing to Carrie and Grace, are evidently fascinated. There is something positively in- fectious in the sparkling flow of spirits that flash out like sunbeams, drawing out all the gushing eloquence of your own nature; and you think it was a something in yourself 6*     "       CARRIE EMERSON. raised up the barrier between you; when, lo! no sooner than you have stepped beyond that charmed circle, his calm reserve and dignity freezes you. You could not presume to be famil- iar; you dare not be less than courteously polite. You feel that, were his anger raised to the highest point of human en- durance, he would not, for a single moment, forget that he was a gentleman, in the fullest sense of the word." Bravo! Allan," said the earnest voice of Henry. "If you had studied our fiiend's character six years, instead of as many months, you could not have spoken a higher eulogium in his favor." A deep silence followed, and the little party strolled slowly homeward; Mrs. Emerson, Annette and Henry, in advance. A little group were seated beneath the latticed roof of the portico of a pretty cottage by the wayside. The busy hum of' voices ceased until they had all gone by; then there was a suppressed titter, and one voice said, in a sweetly modulated tone : "I declare, it looks ridiculous for Mrs. Emerson to be al- ways walking out with the young people! I guess she forgets she is growing old." "( Growing old, Lu.! She will never grow old; or if she should, hers would be a green old age." "' Perhaps she 's afraid to trust Carrie with the young gentle- men who visit there occasionally," said H-ester Rand. "She need n't be afraid of Mr. Moore," said Mary Eldrich, satirically; "Carrie's too young; she could n't very well con- tribute to his amusement." "Young! So is he - not a day over twenty-four; and, by your own account, she is coquettish enough to adapt herself to any one's company."-   CAR  IE EME RS ON.         67 "Pshaw! nonsense! He fancies 'the feast of reason and the flow of soul;' he is intellectual, you know!" "O, I understand! he has found a kindred spirit in Mrs. Emerson, spiced by a touch of romance. How well they must enjoy each other's society! He is her cousin, too; so of course it must be all right." "I should think people would talk about her; she walks, and sails, and rides with the young people, just as much as if they could n't go without her." "And what do you suppose she'd care, Lu., if they did? That woman is perfectly independent of the opinion of the world. She never troubles herself about the affairs of others, and she don't mean they shall trouble her. Besides, her hus- band don't find fault, and why should others?" ".Perhaps he don't know what she does, or where she goes."  "Let him come home oftener, then," said Jennie Lee. "If I were Mrs. Emerson, I wouldn't deprive myself of any pleasure on his account; it is more than he would do'  "I was in company with him a. while ago," said a young gentleman, " and some of the party took it upon themselves, in a joking kind of way, to censure him for leaving his wife so often with the sole care of the family; they cited one or two pattern husbands and fathers, and asked him what he thought of the matter, adding, they didn't believe there was another man in the place woulc. put, so much care upon his wife."  "And what did he say to that?" "Said he did n't believe there was another woman in the place so capable as his wife of being left with so much core."     6S       C A R c I E E E MERSON. "Good! good!" was echoed lightly by two or three. "If all the men thought so, there would be more hope of woman's attaining her rilghts." "Call it right!" said the indignant Mary. "If that is right, I should like to know what you call wrong? How many of us would marry, if we had to be bowed down by cares?" "Find me a happier heart, or a face less touched by cares," said Jennie Lee. "They may have been innumerable, and intensely heavy, for aught I know; but, depend upon it, she has never bowed beneath themn." "Perhaps her nature is hard." On the contrary, she is uncommonly sensitive." "Then, how can she rise above such (it may be undeserved, but it cannot be modified) cool, heartless neglect?" "Because she has a nature true as steel. She will not bow to anything her conscience tells he'r is undeserved. No matter whether it be neglect or scorn, envy or hatred, slander or dis- gracei if it be unmerited, she will rise above it, and brave it nobly; it cannot harm her." "How came you to be acquainted with her well enough to study all that out?" said Lu. "For my part, I never could understand her frozen nature." "Frozen it may seem to you; but, depend upon it, there is not a particle of ice about her. She has suffered some, as she is suffering now, under the lash of censure, and it may Iiave made her more reserved than one so genial should be." "Is she so very agreeable, Jennie?" said the owner of the domicil, taking a seat beside her. "I've been listening to your defence of the lady in question; and if she is so free to do I   CARRIE EMERSON..          69 as she likes, I might ingratiate myself into her good graces. I 'm rather old, being on the shady side of fifty; but perhaps I could manage to make myself agreeable." "I think you are too bad, Mr. Jenkins, to speak so slight- ingly of one of whom you know nothing at all." "Know nothing! I 've been listening to your conversation for the last half lour. If she deserves the general opinion, there 's nothing to exalt her above what you are pleased to set down to my credit, as a vitiated taste. If not, and your single voice has awarded the meed of justice, why, I would like to be acquainted with her, as an anomaly worth studying." "And if she be an anomaly, Mr. Jenkins, you'll never make her out, depend upon it," said Jennie, her countenance ex- pressing unqualified disgust. "Why so, my dear?" said Jenkins, wilfully blind to Jen- nie's ill-disguised feeling of disapprobation; sure, too, of more than a well-balanced equivalent in more than one bosom present.  "Because," said Jennie firmly, "Mrs. Emerson is as im- pervious to flattery as slander.. You could not, presume to profess, what you would feel was a superfluity, your friend- ship." "Ha! ha! ha! Where did you learn to argue such ab- struse points? Your knowledge of the world I should suppose very limited, judging from your years." "The sting of the slanderer leaves many a lesson for even the careless looker-on, Mr. Jenkins. Young as I am, I have seen it often." "Don't mind Jennie, Mr. Jenkins; she has been under the influence of a pair of speaking eyes, and an eloquent tongue, lately. Now deny it, if you dare, Jennie."'     70       CARRIE EMERSON. "Mr. Moore is a rare specimen of what we call nature's noblemen; is he not?" said lMary. "He is all that," said Jennie, her calm voice and unflushed cheek giving the lie to the covert insinuation; "and I thank Mrs. Emerson a thousand times for my introduction to one so nobly de crving my unqualified esteem. An hour's conversa- tion with him is one of the most refreshing seasons I ever enjoy. I'm afraid I do not half appreciate him." What if you lose your heart in the midst of such delight- ful association of real and ideal? A blighted youth and an early grave are not the most agreeable antidotes." "I ow absurd, Lu.! Can we not enjoy the society of an agreeable, intelligent gentleman, without the dangerous folly of being in love with him?" "Add handsome and fascinating. Give him his just due, Jennie." "Well, admitting all that; is love the natural conse- quence?" "Of course." "Well, then," said Jennie, laughingly, "there will be two more blighted youth, and two more graves to dig, seeing you run the same fearful risk that I do." "Good! good! but what will become of Carrie Emerson? Is there no danger for her?" ", No, indeed! she is as good as engaged to Henry Irving. Edward Ashley fills the void in hist absence; so she is safe enough at present." A few more days, and Henry Moore bade adieu to his friends, and left for his distant home. Tears fell fast and    .                       C CARRIE EMERSON.           71 free, for a long time must elapse ere he came again, and they well knew that in life's varied phases there was as much of shade as light. But, O, how much more bitter would have been that parting, had they dreamed it was a final one! At first, letters came regularly and frequently; then, a scarcely perceptible change in sentiment, and, at length, dead silence; silence never after broken. What the cause they never knew. There were none knew how bitterly one of that circle re- gretted that one broken link in friendship's fairy chain. Mrs. Emerson, in her secluded home, and under sometimes trying circumstances, had relied more, perhaps, than she was aware upon the judicious advice and pure-minded sympathy of her high-souled cousin and friend. It must have been a powerful thrust that sent home the poisoned arrow to that kindly heart; but so it was. A slight cause would never work so mighty a change.' She felt it was so, and submitted to it patiently, knowing there would be a reunion where the sting of the slanderer could not come. And Julian Percy, too, far away in his luxuriant home, sur- rounded by loved ones, forgot the rural retreat where he had spent so many happy hours. And so goes the world! Harsh lessons for the sensitive, trusting heart but the only ones to teach it how to discriminate between the real and ideal; between the glitter and the solid ore.      CHAPTER VI.

"Poor race of men!" said the pitying spirit, "Dearly ye pay foir your primal fall; Some flowerets of Eden ye still inherit, But the trail of the serpent is over them all." MOORE'S LALLA ROOKH. THEY had been discussing the same subject for perhaps the hundredth time, when Edward Ashley came in. "What makes you all look so serious? Have you heard bad news?" "No, Ed.," said Carrie; "but I begin to feel as if bad news would be better than none at all." O, don't say so, Carrie!" "Yes, I do really think I could bear anything, better than this miserable suspense." He bent over her and whispered a few words in her ear. A sudden start, and then a deadly pallor spread itself over   CARRIE EMERSON.           73 her face, as with a mighty effort she struggled with some powerful emotion. She dared not trust her voice; but Ed- ward understood the appealing glance. "Get your bonnet, Carrie," he said, cheerfully, " and come with me. Mrs. Leavitt has a sick child, and mother asked me to call and see if they needed a watcher; because, if they do, she 'll go." ( If they do, perhaps I might do as well," said Carrie, conquering her quivering lip and trembling speech, feeling the need of exertion. "Well, Carrie," said Mrs. Emerson, "if you feel that you are equal to it, you can go and see how sick the child is, and then decide," she added, without raising her eyes. from her work. Soon as they got into the open air, Edward drew her arm within his, and, speaking in a low tone, begaD%: , Yes, Carrie, Henry Irving got back a week ago; and, as if it was n't mysterious enough that such was the fact, and that we were not notified of it, and, as if we had n't suffered anxiety enough on his account, and made all manner of ex- cuses for his unaccountable silence, ten times more than he deserves, too, he must cut me openly. Yes, Carrie, and with such an imperious, scornful air, that my first, and, if I must own it, last impression was to knock him down." " Ed.! you wouldn't do that?" "Yes I would, Carrie! What have I done to merit such conduct? And what have you done to merit such cool, heartless neglect? In the evening, we chanced to meet again. It was my turn to show scorn, and I tell you I did n't have to assume it either. He deigned to bow upon' his entrance, the 7     74       CARRIE EMERPSON. scoundrel! I could have kicked him out of the room with a good will. What right has such a heartless fellow to scatter smiles among the true-hearted and honorable?" "O E.! don't talk so; wait until you hear." "Wait until you hear! I heard it whispered that Mr. Irving would soon be united to a Creole lady, to whom he has of late been very attentive-the undisputed heiress of an immense fortune. Sold himself for gold! O, Carrie! my check burned with shame for him while I listened." "It may be false, Ed. Do not condemn him yet." "God knows I wish it were, Carrie. At first, I could not credit the assertion; but it soon began to circulate; and, when I heard him joining in the gay laughter and light badinage, I felt I had n't given him credit for any too much duplicity." "( How long will he remain in the city, do you suppose, Ed.? I think I couldbear it better if he were away." "Not long, you may depend. But cheer up, dear Carrie! Never let him think you cared enough about him to bring a tear to your eye." They were wending their way homewards slowly, very slowly, for hope, lately so brilliant and buoyant, had died away in one bosom, and the quick revulsion of feeling had left her all nerveless and weak. So absorbed were they in the one unavailing regret, that they did not note the footfall of another close behind them. When they neared the house, Edward said kindly, "I am obliged to leave to-morrow for New York; my father has important business there, requir- ing immediate attention, and, as his health does not admit of a rapid journey, he has delegated me. I 'm sorry to leave just now, as I know you 'll need me; shan't you, Carrie? I Id   CARRIE  EMERSON.         75 meant to come over every day, and inspire you with new courage; but I'll write to you, or your mother, once or twice while I'm there. So promise you 'll keep up a good heart. And now, as they require a more experienced watcher, I 'll hasten home and let my mother know.  Good-night, dear Carrie! I will come over in the morning before I start; " and he left her to give thel:intelligence she had gained to her mother. "And now, mother, would you have believed it, from any other lips?" "No, my child, I believe I would not, Strange he should treat Edward so! I can't imaginea. ;" "Nor I, either; they were such firm friends, too. It was Ed. first introduced him to me. I suppose he regards him, as we do, almost as one of the family; and, if he gave up one, thought it best to give up all." "I saw some one this morning," said Willie the next day, "looked exactly like Henry, only not quite so pleasant- looking." "That's impossible, Willie! Henry wouldn't come to Cliftonville without coming here." But while had not been deceived. Henry had come in the last train the previous evening, and gone directly to the retired spot where the Emersons were located. He had seen Ashley draw Carrie's arm within his, and followed them, near as he dared, in their lonely walk. He had overheard the parting words of Edward, noted the depression of Carrie, and attributed it to the week's absence of one he no longer doubted was an acknowledged lover.     76       C A R IE I E5l S ON. With a bitterness of soul, as unnatural as it was powerful, he hastened back to the hotel, called for a room, and, for the  greater part of the night, paced the floor with the hurried steps of a madman. Over and over again he muttered curses upon the heartless coquetry of one whose image he hadigar- nered up for years,- even since he was a boy,- though she had  never known it. Some two years since, through the interpo- sition of Edward, she had become acquainted with him; and,  to gratify her childhood's companion and friend, taken an in- [ terest in the high-souled youth, Edward was never weary of prai-ing, which had ripened into esteem, and finally  love; and for a year they had been solemnly pledged to each other. Henry had departed immediately after for the Eldo- rado, where he was rapidly amassing a fortune. The busi- ness he was engaged in yielded even more than it promised;  everything denoted success, and Henry was superlatively hap-  py. All his dreams seemed likely to be realized. The heart he had so coveted was all his own, beyond a doubt. Nothing  but death could mar his brilliant hopes. Alas, that human happiness should rest upon so frail a foundation that a single breath may waft it away! Six months after Henry was established in California, he met an old friend and schoolmate in the street, Thomas Eldrich. Delighted to see a familiar face, he gave him a hearty wel-  come, invited him to dine, and in the social hour that fol- lowed made many inquiries after old friends and associates.  Thomas gave the information in a style peculiar to him- self. Henry had mentioned every name except Carrie Em- erson. He knew their engagement had been kept a secret,  although his preference for her had not been so, and he shrank   '   CARRIE EMERSON.           " from hearing the name, so sacred to him, repeated by Tom Eldrich. Besides, Tom was a rejected lover, though he had seemed never to care; a mysterious thing to Henry. Tom noted the circumstance, and partly from- a love of mis- chief (his slandering propensity being hereditary, of course he couldn't help it), and partly to revenge himself for the slight he felt more keenly than he was willing to acknowl- edge, he let his fun-loving propensity take flight, just to see, as he expressed it to himself, how Henry would relish a rival. His first description was a sail down the bay, where they were having some capital sport, fishing, when Carrie Emerson ("you remember her, Harry") must take it into her head to go sea-sick; and Ed. Ashley, who had command of the boat, and by whose invitation they were all there, in direct opposition of pretty much all the party, got under way, and put about for home. "Carrie was sick, I know; but then she would have got over it in a little time, no doubt; but Ed. would have his own way, and we started for home. It had looked squally all the morning, and, before we got half way up the harbor, I tell you, we had enough of it. Some of the young ladies were sick, and some were horribly frightened, and screamed fear- fully, which so provoked Ed. that at last he let them have their own way, and scream to their hearts' content. Carrie Emer- son did n't say a word, and if she was afraid, she kept it to . herself; but she was faint and feeble; and I say, Harry, you ought to have been there, just to have seen Ed. He tried to shield her; but no, she was obliged to take her share of the Irenching with the rest of us. When we reached the landing we were left to get home as best we could, and they all left 7*  / / /' /     I78       CARRIE EMERSON. but myself. I thought I 'd stay and get my lesson perfect; not knowing," with a sly wink, that made him look hateful in Henry's eyes, " but she might choose to let me sun myself in her bright eyes at some future time; when-what do you think?-the gentleman had the assurance to ask me to go up and harness his horse, and come down for them! ", Was n't that rich? I offered to stay with Carrie while he went himself; but he turned scornfully on his heel, tossed Bill Lee half a dollar, and started him off in double quick time. Thinks I to myself, if that is n't a match, my name's not Tom Eldrich." ," Well," said Henry, in a voice Tom thought fluttered just a very little, " and what did it amount to?" "Amounted to a flirtation, that lasted till I came away, at all events." Harry began to feel, what Tom would have termed, " deused uncomfortable." He tried to change the conversation; but no; Tom saw that it nettled him, and he was determined to follow it up with a vengeance. Another exaggerated sketch of a horseback ride, where, as usual, Ed. Ashley headed the list, and Carrie Emerson made one of the party. "Carrie's steed grew unmanageable, and at last fairly ran away with her. Of course it was Ashley who came to the rescue; and I say, Harry, if you had heard her mother's eloquent praises of the hero next day, you would n't wonder if the girl did think him perfection." And, leaving the barb to rankle, Tom, with a wicked feeling of satisfaction, bade his friend adieu. The first thing that Irving did, upon being left alone, was to unlock his desk, and take from a private drawer a small pack- q.   CARRIE EMERSON.           79 age of letters. He read them over, one after another, and his brow grew dark as midnight. "t Fool that I was, not to have seen it all before! Here it is as plain as preaching: ' I went down the harbor the other day, with aparty. it came up squally, and we were drenched through. Some of the young ladies were very   much frightened, and I dare say I should have been, but Edward had charge of the boat, and I knew she wags in skilful hands. Ed. is here now, and sends much love.' Curse his love!" mut- tered Irving, " aqd himself too, if he must come between me and all I crave of happiness." Another letter gave an animated account of the ride, and the rescue, with a heartfelt eulogium upon their mutual friend. "Call him not friend,-an' thou lovest me," was spoken audibly this time. "I see it all now. O, Edward Ashley! I thought I could trust you. I did not think you would be base enough to steal away my treasure." Henry forgot, in his anguish and excitability, that it was his earnest parting request that Edward would be, what he had ever been since their earliest recollection, an attentive friend, near and dear as a brother. "Strange," he mused, "that I never fea/ed before that such perfect confidence and esteem would ripen into love! Why could it not have taken place before our engagement? All this comes of the lesson her mother has inculcated, that, if there were less reserve between the sexes generally, the re- sult would be highly beneficial. If young ladies were to treat deserving young gentlemen with the respect and confi- dence necessary to draw them out, they would secure a true friend and brother in many a:n instance. The foolish fear     80       CARRIE EMERSON. would be wholly done away with, that an engagement must follow, of course, any little display of civility or attention, as is too often the case; which would enhance the pleasure of social intercourse. "I used to think her theory right, and wish it were more generally believed; but I see now such a state of things would never answer. I used to admire the calm self-possession of both mother and daughter, when I have met visitors at their house, and knew the charm there was in feeling one's self per- fectly at home. Carrie treated them all with the same gentle unreserve she did Ed. Ashley. I wonder why I didn't feel jealous then. But coquetry shows itself in malny different ways. O, to think one I loved should ever deserve that name! But I'll give hei up manfully. "Expostulate? No!" as conscience gave a twinge. "What could I say? No! if she loves Ed. better than she does me, let her have him; but it was mean to deceive me in this way." He lighted a waxen taper, and held, one by one, the delicately-written pages over the consuming blaze. By the time the last vestige had disappeared, he had become calm and resolute. From an unaccountable aversion, however, he resolved to shun Tom Eldrich, though, when they did meet, Tom showed sense enough not to probe the wound he had made. One day, some six weeks afterwards, they happened to meet at the post-office. Tom got a letter fromhome; and, as he ran his eye over the contents, he seemed highly pleased; so much so that Henry overcame his reserve, and ventured to observe, "You have good news, I should think." "Capital! but read for yourself," he said, thrusting tho letter into Henry's hand.   CAR RI E EM ERSON.         81 "DEARi BROTHER: We received yours, and were hap- py to hear of your safe arrival. Your description of the voyage and first impressions upon reaching your port of des- tination was highly gratifying. You must have had a fine time while crossing the stormy Atlantic. I don't envy you a bit of it. I suppose you want to hear what 's going on here; so I 'll try to gratify your love of gossip. And, first, do you recollect, we used to think Clara Benson was setting her cap for Willard Leavitt; you know he does business in H. Well, all of a sudden they came to the conclusion it would be more creditable to be married; and, as a very great compliment, Lu. and I were invited. I am  not going to say a word about the bride,-I leave you to imagine her looks,--but the fixins, as old Mrs. Maynard would say, were unique, and if I should not say profuse, it would be a sad mistake. It turned out to be a family party, where the ceremony was thrown in to give it effect, I suppose. There were Mr. and Mrs. Benson's out-of-town relations, some of them queer-look- ing specimens enough, I assure you; and as, between you and I, Tom, they are not often regaled, they got up for their ben-  efit a kind of hot supper. Just think, Tom; roast turkey and oyster-sauce, cold ham, tea, coffee, and wedding-cake, home-made, of course, all on one table! It was a good, sub- stantial feast, and some of the company did ample justice to Mrs. Benson's unsurpassed powers of cookery. From roasting a fowl, down to making a johnny-cake; there's no mistake in  her. But before I would have taken all the trouble she did for a parcel of country gawkies,-I would have sent Clara off to the minister's to have the knot tied. Mrs. Buncombe was in high dudgeon because she was not invited; she's a neigh-     82       CARRIE EMERSON. bor, you know; but the Bensons don't like her, and they mean she shall know it. While I think of it, I must tell you of something that happened a while ago. It seems Mrs. Em- erson did n't like to have Carrie visit Mrs. Buncombe; but Carrie thought she was beautiful. You know she can put on airs enough, when she chooses, to deceive almost any one, and the first thing Carrie knew, she was talking about her at a great rate. Well, Ed. Ashley heard something that was said, and, as a matter of course, he took it up. If he don't get himself into hot water, as the saying is, I 'm mistaken. Mrs. B. says Ed. has a lady-love out of town, for all he is acting the part of a devoted lover to Carrie all the time; and Mrs. B. has written an anonymous letter to the lady, giving her a few friendly hints. She told it all to me, under a pledge of secrecy; but of course it is just as safe with you. We never can find out anything by the Emersons; but I want to know horridly when the wedding is coming off. I shall try and keep on the right side of them, for, though I do not care a straw for them, I do like to go to weddings, and I am in hopes to get an invitation. I once heard Henry Irving was attentive to her, but suppose there was nothing in it. There has been a visitor at their house lately,- a fine, intellectual-looking fellow,- and I fully expected to see another flirtation; but he took his leave abruptly, to the disappointment of half the girls in town. One young lady went so far as to own she was desperately in love with him. Just think of it! But if Carrie did flirt with him it was done slyly. Perhaps she could n't get a chance; Ed. Ashley's there about half his time. I could tell you a lot more, but must postpone it till next time; so good-by! Lu. willadd a postscript.  MARY.   CARRIE  EMERSON.         83 "P. S. BROTaER MNE: If you get a good chance, do speak a word for me to, you know whom. I don't care if they do say he is a discarded lover of Carrie- Emerson's; they 'll say the same of a good many others, I guess. Yours, Lu." Henry handed back the missive, how thoroughly disgusted with Tom, Mary, and, in short, the whole family. He took an abrupt leave, and, as he wended his way back to his hotel, his memory brought back sundry recollections of backbiting, which came near making serious mischief; and once, particu- larly, when an eligible match came near being broken off, and one, at least, of the parties rendered miserable for life; and those two girls he was pretty sure had the greater share to an- swer for. Gradually light broke upon him, and he took a sud- den resolution to make the most of a pressing necessity, and cross the ocean. No sooner said than done. A steamer was about to start, and, hastily making his arrangments, and tak- ing care not to give Tom Eldrich a hint, he went on board. He arrived in due time, and took up his abode in B., and while attending to some important business, sought, by mak- ing a few inquiries, to come at the truth. It so happened that the lady at whose house he was staying, was acquainted at Cliftonville, and had lately been upon a visit there. She had made quite a number of pleasant ac- quaintances, among whom were Carrie and Edward.  Of course she had heard the gossip, and, not seeing why univer- sal rumor should not for once be true, she corroborated-all he had heard. That evening Edward, being in the city, called, and as mentioned in a former chapter, met with Irving. Not satisfied, however, Henry made a flying visit to Cliftonville, \B     84       CARRIE EMERSON. heard with his own ears, saw with his own eyes, and left sad, disappointed, and almost ready to disavow all faith in woman, friendship and love. O, Henry! Henry! had you never felt the sting of the slanderer, how different would the web of fate beetwoven!   CHAPTER VIII. Alas for the young heart thus early thrown Back on itself, the unloved and the lone! For this should be the lesson of long years, The weary knowledge taught and traced by tears Till even these are frozen, and we grow Cold as the grave that yawns for us below; But this was like those sudden blasts that fling Unlooked for winter on the face of spring,- And worst woe for the heart whose early fate Leaves it so young, and, O, so desolate! She had one feeling left - it was of pride-- O, misery, how much she had to hide! L. E. LANDON. IN a large airy chamber, overlooking the ocean on one side, and an almost endless chain of rocky hill and woodland on the other, lay the attenuated form of Ellen Grant. About a year before, she had come from a distant city in the cars, lo- cated herself, opened a private school, and, for a while, as the people expressed it, had made out wonderfully well. She had been highly educated, and was competent to give thefinishing touches to any young lady who had enjoyed and profited by the advantages of one of the best of public 8     86       CARRIE EMERSON. schools. A large number flocked there daily, each striving to excel in her own peculiar avocation, whether of needlework, painting, music, or languages; and all were unanimous in their praises of sweet Ellen Grant. Harriet Stacy and a few other bigoted ones might have thought her cold and re- served, it might be sinfully proud; but they had never sunned themselves in her bright smile, and how could they know? Who was Ellen Grant? Where did she come from? It was supposed from somewhere in the interior of New York; and that, from her simple dress and unostentatious manners, her relations were poor. They had heard her mention a step-mother and sisters; but, then, who knew? For a long time she had been failing in health, but so grad- ually, that it was hardly perceptible. Now, however, the rose had faded from her cheek; the large lustrous eye shone with unearthly brilliancy; and the slender fingers looked almost transparent, as they lay on the white coverlid. The room was redolent of perfume, for many who loved the gentle girl culled for her their choicest flowers, to gratify her almost passionate love for them. The day had been sultry in the extreme, and the curtains were put aside, and the windows all wide open, to admit every breath of the hushed and stifled air. Her ear caught the sound of distant thunder, and she won- dered if it would keep away one who had promised to keep watch and vigil with her through another night. A few moments, and with a quick, light step, a young girl drew near, and through the dim light she recognized, with a grateful pressure of the hand, Carrie Emerson. "I came early, Ellen, because I feared the tempest would   CARRIE EMERSON.           87 be a wild one. Do you see the giant shadows creeping up behind the hills? And look! look at the lurid lightning! It must be terrific across the bay." Ellen smiled as she noticed the irrepressible shudder, as Carrie drew nearer the bedside. "You are not afraid, Carrie?"  "No, not positively afraid, Ellen; -but there is a feeling of awe that subdues and makes me feel more sensibly, my own nothingness. When I was a child I thought it was the voice of God; and I used to hide my face lest I should see Him in the lightning. The feeling has lingered till now, and ], fear I shall never wholly overcome it."  "It is fitting we should feel so, Carrie. I am so glad you did come early!" she added after a pause. "I have something to say to you, and I wish to say it to-night." The tempest came on with almost overwhelming force. Carrie clasped the thin hand of the dying girl within her own, and trembled lest the spirit should pass away amid such wild din. And then it swept by; but for hours there was not a breath of air, apparently, and not until norning did the red lightning cease to flash. When the heavy thunder had died away in the distance, and Carrie had arranged everything for the night, she seated herself by the bedside of her friend, and waited for another waking moment. "How beautiful she is!" thought Carrie, as the waxen face, with the long lashes resting on it, was visible in the dim light. "I wonder if she has ever known disappointment." Her own crushed hopes came up before her, and, spite of her efforts, large tears forced themselves through the half-closed lids,janed     S8        CARRIE EMERSON. one after another trickled slowly down over her face. The sudden unclosing of those large sunlit eyes started her, and with a hasty nervous movement she brushed away the evi- dences of bitter suffering. But it was too late. Ellen had noticed a change in her favorite, and she had meant, by giving her own confidence, to win hers in return. She did not notice what she saw was meant to be concealed; but with a sweet smile, and a cheerful voice, said, "Come a little nearer, Carrie; it hurts me so to talk. I am going to make you my ghostly confessor, so pray be all attention. I cannot stay long, and my sad story may benefit you. "I am an orphan, Carrie. My mother died in giving birth to me; and my father, dying soon after, bequeathed me to his only brother. Riches in abundance were his; a wife, all woman can be. She was a treasure in herself, and she brought him a fortune equal to his own. Two lovely chil- dren, both girls, made their home a paradise. When the youngest was but a few days old I was brought home to them, and admitted at once into a full share of the love and sym- pathy of both their hearts. I pass over the many happy years, in which I had never even dreamed of sorrow, until I was sixteen. A fearful epidemic passed through our flourish- ing village, and my beloved aunt and the two girls fell victims to it. I know not why I was spared; but so it was. I pass over the first bitter, stunning grief, for time is flitting fast, and I amn going home to them. "At the expiration of another year my uncle married again. A fascinating widow, with two young daughters, had taken up their residence in our neighborhood; and, whether   CARRIE EMERSON.           89 from some fancied resemblance, to his lost treasures, or a combination of artful, insinuating, intriguing maneuvres, I never could tell, but he married her, and installed her mistress of his heart and home, after a courtship of only six weeks. "The daughters, briefly speaking, were spoiled children of a weak, vain and indulgent mother; and if my beloved uncle was blinded, it was owing to the tact, constantly exerted, to keep their failings in the background. "At first I tried to please the lady; but soon found it a hopeless task. She was soft, and bland, and gentle, almost to a fault; but she had the tact of saying the most cutting things in a way you could not positively resent, and which would rankle, let you struggle against it as powerfull as you might.  "After a while a change was evident, even th my un- suspecting nature. An old nurse, who had been in the family a good many years, was dismissed, and for a reason so trivial that it seemed positively cruel and unjust. A gener- ous sum of money, from the hand of my uncle, if it did not heal the wound, salved it over, and shut the mouth of any one who might have presumed to interfere. But old Susan, though grateful, was not to be blinded; and, before she left, opened my eyes to many things unseen, or unheeded, before. "Gradually, one after another, every servant of the house- hold was dismissed, and by some ingenious, calculating method, places provided, apparently from the best motives, at a distanee. "I was grieved to part with them; for most of them had been in the house ever since I was born; and, I could not tell why, but an icy chill seemed creeping over my uncle 8*     90       CARRI:E EMERSON. Grant; though his bland, fascinating wife threw a charm around himn which I could not define, yet Telt palpably elloulgh. I saw that, except through her, I could not ap- proach him. "You wonder how I bore it, Carrie. I'll tell you. Love had thrown around me a dreamy spell, and there was no room in my heart for grief, or any other absorbing emotion. Per- lhaps I was selfish. I think I was; but I had not then learned the bitter lesson that teaches us to look beyond this world1 for hlaptpiness. "The all of tgrief I had ever known was upon the surface. Th1e deep fountains of the soul were still untroubled. Young as I was, I had been engaged two long years, and with the heIarty approlbation of my more than parents, to a youllng gentleman, an orphan, like myself; and one who, as ward ath junior partner, stood highl in the estimation of my uncle Grant. "he had been   en absent at the time of the marriage, and many of the changes I have named took place before his re- turnl. "Angela, tlic eldest of the two sisters, was called beautiful; 1and she was, beautiful as an houri; and Percy Hamilton, fromn tlec first moment of his introduction, seemed spell-bound. lIe would sit for hours, listening to her light raillery, or the 1glad strains of melody, gushing fbrthl in sentimental words, which seemed e r fraught with meanini(T. 'I was often inclined to beJ ad and thoughtful before his return; now doully so. It was a strange, chilling contrast to her gay, glad nature, on which no cloud had ever rested; and Percy must have felt it so.   CARRIE EMERSON.           91 "My voice, which had been thought by dear and partial friends wonderfully clear and sweet (I may say it now, Car- rie, for I am dying), was growing tremulous and husky; and if at times I was urged to take part in some favorite duet, I dared not trust to its firmness; and I am aware how much it told against me. "' Imperceptibly, but certainly, coldness was springing up between us; and I know not how, or why, but an ungen- erous misconstruction was put upon many a little, trivial word or action; the merest trifle, perhaps, at the time (and O, Carrie, what a heavy chain is often woven out of ' trifles light as air! '), but sure,.in the end, to make a breach some- where; which my step-mother was sure to widen, by a bland remark, soft, and aptly chosen, but, nevertheless, barbed, and sent home. "Sick at heart, yet scarcely knowing of what to complain, I tried to bear my lot patiently, trusting to time, and a previous arrangement, to set all right. We were to have been married-in a few months, and set up an establishment of our own; but, of late, Percy seemed to forget that e were aught to each other. "It was indeed seldom that we were left al, e, even for a moment; and when we were, there was a    traint resting upon both, which neither liked or dared to br ik. "You noticed the hush that preceded the tdmpet to-night, Carrie. Well, just so it was with me. A sense of injury had been crushing and benumbing every faculty for long, and every channel seemed frozen over; but, for all that, the storm was gathering. 'Deceit is the world's passport; who would dare, IB     HHowever pure the breast, to lay it bare?'     92        C A R 1R I E E SER O N . "A little girl had been sent to me, in the morning, to say that some seil ng her mother had enfgaged to do for lme could not be complettld, as she was taken'sick; and I thought I would call and see if she could direct me to some one else, as I wished it done as soon as possible. "She happened to know a person she thought would suit me, and I went directly there. While giving the woman some directions, I heard, from the next room, the sound of half a dozen voices, in earnest declamation; and so earnest grew the conversation, that the woman I was talking to made some trivial excuse to leave the room a moment, and was in their midst. I paid little heed to the clatter of voices, until my own name was spoken, in a manner that made my blood boil. ' Ellen 's a fool not to see that he 's tired of her! Why, Mrs. (Granl t :says he 's all but told her so; but she won't take a hint. I 'm poor, but I 'd work my fingers' ends off before I 'd be a dependent upon any one's bounty.' "'And i Mr. Grant says they were too young when they were engaged; he did n't know his own mind, and he's too hotorable, now, to break his word. But he won't have her; fbr, after all, she's as poor as we are. Mrs. Grant says Mr. Percy Hamilton can do better.' "I now recognized the voice of a pretty waiting-maid- the joint property, or rather her services were, of the sisters; and I knew her knowledge came from the fountain-head. ' Mrs. Grant says,' sle continued, ' it will ruin'Angela's prospects if she stays here; but how to get rid of her is the qpestion. The master sees, as well as she does; but he can't tell her to go, seeing she's his oIlly brother's only child, and has n't a relation in the world except himself. I think as t ^-   CARRIE  EM E RSON.        93 Miss Angela does, if I'd had all the money spent on me that she has, I'd go out into the world, and make myself in- dependent. I'd not stay where I was n't wanted.' "To all appearance I was calm, Carrie; but my heart beat wildly, and my eyes flashedifire, as I crossed the thresh- old, and stood in the midst of that group of gossips. "' I am Ellen Grant!' I said sternly. 'If you have any more to say, please say it in my own home, and to my face.' "There was a sudden start, and two or three dropped off. The waiting-maid stood her ground, however. Turning saucily round, between a asneer and a smile of complacency, she said: "'Your home, forsooth! 'T isn't half so much your home as it is mine; for I am independent. I'd scorn to eat the bread of idleness.'              - "A coarse, unfeeling laugh followed the bravado othe pert thing; and, with the sound still ringing in my ears, I hastened home. Home! O, my God! It must be seldom a word so hallowed can fall on the crushed heart sQeavily as that word had fallen on mine!         '  "As I passed through the hall, on my way to mytcham- ber, I saw Angela in tears, and Percy leaning over her, speak- ing in a low, soothing tone. Stung to the quick, I sprang past the door, and reached my chamber. In another moment I was aware something had happened in my absence. People were passing softly up and down stairs; and hushed voices w ere consulting together. Before I had calmed my outraged feelings, one of the servants opened the door, and, putting in her head, said, abruptly: "It 's all over, miss; he died about five minutes ago.' N% '                            : s &,eb     "       CARRIE EMERSON. "' Good God! Mary,' I exclaimed, 'whom, or what do you e1aln? '  "' I mean the master, miss; he had an apoplectic fit, and he never came out of it.' "I heard no more. Mary laid me upon the bed, and waited until I came out of the deadly faint into which I had fallen, and then her household duties called her away, and I heard no more until summoned to tea. As you may suppose, I was in no mood to join any one. "A little tender note of condolence from Percy stung me with its duplicity, and I flung it by. I scorned the pity that had called it forth. "I kept my chamber for, a week. I was really sick, and needed rest to nerve me for what I knew was before me.  "I pass over the intervening time until I was summoned to be present at the reading of the will. "I entered the parlor, where the family were all assembled. It was the first time I had seen one of them since that never- to-be-forgotten day. When I came in Percy was leaning over Angela's chair; but, upon my entrance, he came quickly forward to lead me to a seat. I saw the movement, and dropped upon the nearest chair. "I had been schooling my heart to bear up under its wrongs, and I had succeeded nobly. I did not even tremble. "(Iy looks must have chilled the hitherto warm-hearted Percy, for he turned pale as death; and, with his back towards Angela, stood with his eyes riveted to the floor, until every word of that hateful parchment had been read. "( To my beloved wife, and children Angela and Elma, I bequeath the whole bulk of my property.' Then came the   CARRIE EMERSON.          95 specified amount of real estate, bank stock, and the usual specifications 'To my niece, Ellen, I have given an educa- tion as an equivalent for money; if she do not turn it to good advantage, in case of necessity, it is her own fault. If she marry Percy Hamilton, she will not need it.' :   "There was a buzz of astonishment, which was broken in upon by Mrs. Grant, and I heard her say to Percy, who stood like one utterly confounded; ' Please step into the next room, Mr. Hamilton; I have a few words to say to you.' ,  "I can hardly tell you, Carrie, how I reached my room, or how, when there, I struggled for strength and calmness to bear me up under my griefs. I cared not for the loss of property. I felt that by some unfair means I had been robbed of my uncle's love-of my lover's faith. "It was too late to repair the wrong, even had I the knowledge of when or where it originated. "Percy Hamilton! Even now my voice quivers at the sound of his name. Did he care for the fate of tfie hapless, injured orphan? "That night, in the stillness of my chamber, I wrenched away from my soul, as I thought, every tie that bound my fate to his. I sat down to pen him a note. All the pride of my woman's nature revolted. Had he not, by his own duplicity, broken the last link in love's golden chain?  What had I to say? "I put up my clothes, jewelry, and what money I had by me,--my uncle was always liberal,-in a travelling trunk, slipped quietly out at early morn, engaged a carriage, cau- tioned the man to be careful and not disturb the family, as I 3. v;     90       CARRIE EMER SON. was going a journey, and had taken my leave the night before. I drove directly to the cars, and bought a ticket for B. After making some inquiries, I found my way to this place, and, by constant employment, strove to forget my wrongs "I always felt, spite of outward appearances, a hope that I had judged Percy wrongly, and that in time he would be restored to me. The more I indulged in such fancies, the more calm and contented I became. But one day, - do you remember, Carrie?-I was reading a paper and fainted away. ", Well, my eye glanced over the words in the marriage de- partment, ' Percy Hamilton, Esq., to Angela, daughter of the late William Grant, Esq., of New York.' O, Carrie! the last frail cord was severed. The sting of the slanderer has done its work. I am dying, Carrie-dying of a broken heart!" "Don't sob so, pray don't," said the fluttering voice of the stricken girl. i"My secret would have died with me, but that I thought it would benefit you, love. And now, Carrie, if aught has colle between you and Henry, strive to bear it better than I have. I have made every necessary arrangement for the dis- posal of what little I leave. iIy jewelry, watch, and a few other valuable trinkets, I have left to you. "You wonder, dearest, how I could, under such a weight of grief, attend to such trivial things. But I am done with the world, Carrie. I am young to be weary of life so soon, -scarcely nineteen,-but it seems as if a whole long life- time had been crowded into two short years. When I am gone, come and sit beside me in the quiet church-yard some- ;! vtimes, Carrie; will you not?   CARRIE  EMERSO N.        97 "And now calm yourself, and tell me what makes you so sad." vI   A few words explained how matters stood; and though Ellen, who from her own bitter experience could glean little of hope for the future, could not lid her trust and think of Henry as still true-hearted, when she remembered how soon Percy had forgotten her,--yes, he must have forgotten her entirely, to give his hand so soon to another,-yet she tried to raise and cheer her spirits, and point her to something bet- ter than vain regrets for one so utterly unworthy. -a:  "Think how much more favored of Heaven, Carrie! You have parents, brother, friends, kind, judicious and affection- ate; in fact, all you need to make you happy; while I, iso- lated and cut off from all that made life desirable, am only too thankful to leave a world of which I have long been weary. "After I am gone, Carrie, you will hear many remarks upon my strange silence concerning the past. Very little has been made known to any one; it was not necessary. I have had ample time; all that is needful I have left upon paper in proper form; the rest you will lock in your own bosom. ! I.  "Ask your mother to be with me when I am passing away; and you, too, Carrie., I can never tell you how much her friendship has done for me. She has helped me stem the tide, when, perhaps, I should have sunk under it. -Give my love to Eward. I should like to see him once more. Tell him the lonely orphan was grateful for his kind attentions." A few days more, and Carrie stood with a band of school- mates at the humble grave hollowed for-Ellen Grant. The     98       CARRIE EMERSON. service was feelingly impressive. The gentle heart of the young pastor had been early touched by grief, and, in the hours he had spent in the sick-room of the devoted girl, he had fathomed enough to know that, subdued and chastened as she was, her every hope was centred in a better world. Tears fell fast and freely; but, perhaps, among the sad group there was not one, except Carrie Emerson, who realized how happy must be the disembodied spirit, released from its suf- ferings, and looking down from its high abode with perfect happiness. The distribution of her few effects among the few, who, by gentle acts of kindness and sympathy, attached themselves to the pale sufferer, was duly made; but, for the rest, she had passed away and was soon forgotten.   4 :t         CICHAPTER    IX.

Come, Angela, just go round with me. Ma' has prepared the dresses; they are splendid. I am to personate a Spanish lady; my dark hair and eyes suiting well the rich costume. Yours is that of a Greek in her bridal robes. Come, Angle, just go and look at them." "What would be the use, Elma? You know I cannot go." "Fiddlestick! nonsense! Leave ma' to manage; she'll arrange all to a charml." But Percy don't like ma's interference. He has told me so o111e the1 olnce." "Well, who cares what he likes? You ought to feel dif- ferentt; if it had n't been for ma's managing, somebody else would have been mistress of this splendid mansion, I 'm thinking." "I begin to think somebody else was better suited to Mercy's methodistical views, Elma. He knows very well now, what he had no chance of learnitng before, thanks to ma's maneuvring, that our habits and tastes are very dissimilar. As my lord and imaster, he thinks himself entitled to lay down certain restrictions; and for the same reason expects me to yield to them tacitly." "I should think things were come to a pretty pass; and so, I suppose, as a dutiful wife you are obliged to submit without a struggle! Heigho! all this comes of being in love, and being blind." "And I don't think I was in love with Percy. I thought it would be an eligible match, and at the same titne a triumph over one, whom every one thought a superior woman; and another reason why I lent nmself to ma's scheming propen-   CARRIE EMERSON.          101 sity was, that person was a perfect eye-sore. It was not so much to gain a husband; I could have. accomplished that at any time" --with a complacent smile and a glance at an opposite mirror, -" but reason told me it would be better for us all if she were out of the way." "And, after all, Angela, who was to blame? I told Percy that she was getting pious, and did not like the idea of being yoked with an unbeliever; that she preferred the evening lecture to the crowded ball-room; that she 'd walk two miles any time to see old Susy, when she would n't take the trouble to come down stairs to meet Mrs. Fulton, or Miss Manning, though she knew they were particular friends of ours, and we were afraid they 'd think her more eccentric than she really was; but, then, I only did it for the sake of teasing him. Who ever thought of his taking everything in earnest?' "O, Elma! all I wish is, that ma' had n't been so decided about that hateful will. It was rather hard to be left out entirely, when she had been brought up as an own child. Mr. Grant would never have listened to ma' about 'that, if she had n't told him such a story about Ellen being false to Percy, and positively engaged to another. And only just think of it? Ellen never saw or heard of the person, as I know of." "Well, you know ma' was obliged to use powerful argu- ments if she used any. It would not have answered to let her have an opportunity to expostulate; that would have been the very way for her to have cleared up the mystery. It was not for the property she cared. If ma' had not managed exactly as she did, I rather think she, instead of you, would have been Mrs. Percy Hamilton, with a good share of Mr. Grant's wealth appended." 9*     102      CARRIE EM IERSON. "Sometimes I wish she had been, Elma. There will always be a fear of his meeting her, and of an explanation taking place, and then we should all feel pretty." "Pho! what if they should? She couldn't help herself now.  She's too proud to accept of anything at Percy's hands; and, besides, she thinks he was faithless and fickle- minded. Pshaw! she's too proud to let any one know where she is; so there is not a bit of danger. Come, Ange, ma's waiting for us to drive out with her ;" and the sisters left the room humming a popular air. There was a deep groan from the adjoining anteroom; but the sweet strain had drowned it, and its echo fell heavily on the breast from whence it issued. Percy Hamilton! the dream is over! - the illusion is past! Percy had come in a few minutes previous to Elma's entrance, and feeling tired, and wishing to read a few pages of a pamphlet a friend had asked his opinion of, he had passed into the anteroom, and thrown himself upon a couch, and thus had been an unavoidable listener to every word. At first anger kept him silent, then curiosity, and finally a feeling of anguish such as he had never felt before. He paced the room with rapid and unequal steps; then, snatching up a pen, wrote: "Angela, I am about to leave town upon important busi- ness. I cannot say what day I shall return. It is my posi- tive command that you do not go to the masquerade. "PERCY." Sealing it hastily, and tossing it upon Angela's embroidery frame, he left the house, and going to a hotel called for a room, and shut himself up until something should suggest   CARRIE  EMERSON.         103 itself for the future. All the inexplicible past was explained. Strange how fast memory cleared the tangled web! No won- :i   der Ellen had appeared sad, and cold, and dispirited, and some- times even morose! How could he have been so deceived?. But, then, how could any one resist the gentle, persuasive voice of Mrs. Grant, when she chose to argue a point? Who, that ever looked in the sweet face of Angela, would dream of duplicity? Who would not have trusted to time, and waited patiently, under the circumstances, for Ellen to explain the change apparent in her feelings? And if she chose to leave him in such an unaccountable manner, who could blame him for feeling resentment, or believing, as Mrs. Grant pos- itively asserted the fact, that some one else had won her af- fecti'ns in his absence? In fact, that was the prime reason for her being disinherited. And it was all false-utterly- without foundation! He wrung his hands in agony.  He loathed the very thought of those with whom he had linked his fate for life. When the shadows of evening fell he had grown calm, and plans for the future had begun to assume a more reasonable appearance. Drawing on an overcoat, purchased for the oc- casion, and slouching his hat over his eyes, he stationed him- self near Mrs. Grant's door. Presently a carriage drew up, and the two sisters, habited as he expected, made their appear- ance. He listened to the parting words of their mother, as with q look of triumph she surveyed them. "Take care, Elma, and don't disarrange the drapery. And, Angela, don't be foolish, and let any little qualms of conscience spoil your - pleasure.

If I tell him it is false, of course he'll believe it. Next time, you be resolute, and tell him you will go. 'T is high time he found out you have a will of your own. Good-night, dears." And the carriage drove off with the sisters, twin-born in duplicity. "And now," said Percy to himself, " a man, I suppose, has a perfect right to change his mind; especially, if business of more importance keep him at home." And, in no very enviable state of mind, he bent his steps that way. The hours wore wearily away, and morning was beginning to dawn; and still, with restless spirit and unequal step, Per- cy Hamilton paced the floor of his splendid drawing-rooms, and close beside him seemed to linger the gentle form of Ellen Grant. Sometimes, with a reproachful glance, she pointed to the dim, distant future, where poverty and wretchedness hung like clouds over her intricate pathway. Sometimes, fragile and fading, she seemed already gathering around 'her the drapery of the grave. And he, by his blind credulity, had done it all. Wrought up almost beyond human endurance, he was scarcely aware of the sound of carriage-wheels ap- proaching. Another minute, and a light step was heard in the vestibule, and Angela, radiant with pleasure and excite- nent, clad in her Greek habiliments, bounded into the room. Had a spectre met her gaze, she would not have been more horror-struck. Had Satan, arrayed as an angel of light, appeared to him, he would have shrunk back scarcely less abhorrently. With a cool, measured glance, he surveyed her from head to foot; then, with a smile of ineffable contempt, turned on his heel, and left the house.     CARRIE EMERSON. t         105 As might have been expected, he shunned her for the rest of the day; and when, worn out, and with feelings sunk to the lowest ebb, he came in, at the close of evening, he found Mrs. Grant, armed with sophistry, and gentle, winning soft- ness, to turn aside his just resentment. Percy bowed coldly, upon his entrance, and, taking out a newspaper, seated himself, and with a look that said plainly, interrupt me, if you dare! glanced over its contents. All at once, an anguished cry burst from his lips, and the paper dropped from his neryeless hand. Snatching up his hat, he rushed out again into the open air, and paced street after street, until thoroughly exhausted. Growing calm, at length, he returned home. Angela had retired, by her mother's advice, and was in a sweet sleep. "I have waited, as you see," said Mrs. Grant, "in hopes to gain some insight into this inexplicable conduct. As the mother of Angela, I have a right to demand it." "Madam," said Percy, haughtily, I wish none of your interference. Had I known your damnable propensity sooner, I might have been spared this weight of anguish. The gnaw- ings-of remorse would not have been added to the lighter pangs of regret." "Remorse? So you do feel that you have injured my poor Angela! You should have sought an explanation before giv- ing way to such unwarrantable ebullitions of temper. You should know that when a man begins to enact the petty domestic tyrant, it is perfectly natural for his wife (especially if she be young and pretty, and accustomed to having her slightest wish gratified) to rebel. It was my fault, more than hers, her going to the ball." (She took care not to say masquerade.)     106       CARRIE EMERSON. "I could n't bear she should be deprived of so much pleasure, just to gratify a silly whim, which, to tell the truth, I thought it high time you were cured of. Besides, she did n't get your command, sir,-there's no use in trying to modify it,- until it was too late. As it was, the poor child went reluct- antly enough, and came home half dead with nervous head- ache, caused by excitability; the foolish fear of having offended you, acting too powerfully upon her delicate, sensi- tive nature." "Pshaw!" said Percy, his dark eyes flashing fire, and pausing suddenly in his rapid steps across the room. "Do not add falsehood to your other sins! Angela is all that a woman can be -brought up in such an atmosphere. Born and nurtured in the hot-bed of deception, how can she be- other than she is?" "Remember she is my daughter, sir." "I do remember it, madam! I shall remember it, with bit- ter loathing, to my dying day! Let it suffice you to know 1 was in the anteroom, prior to her leaving it -with Elma. I heard your parting words to her when she entered the car- riage to go to the masquerade. I was here in this very r6om when she returned. She looked anything but a sufferer, worn out by regret; and her delicate, sensitive nature is, no doubt, at this very moment, seeking the refreshment it needs, in calm, untroubled sleep. Madam!" headded, between his set teeth, with a face livid as death, and a voice hollow as despair, "where is Ellen Grant?" "Ellen Grant! What should I know of her, Percy?"- as- tonishment vainly striving to get the better of her studied calmness. You know, as well as I do, that she left us in a   CARRIE EMERSON.          107 -' very mysterious manner; just at the moment, too, when I was suffering most intensely from my sudden bereavement. I had no more doubt then, than I have at present, that she eloped with some one, whose dupe or victim she had become." "Stop!"' he thundered forth. "Dare speak such words again, in my presence, and, woman as you are, I 'll turn you, even at this late hour, into the street!" A moment he struggled to keep down the sob of anguish; then, in a subdued voice, gasped forth: "Ellen Grant is dead!---yes, dead!  Alone, amongst strangers; struggling with God only knows what privations; pining under a sense of wrong; stung to the very soul by your heartless hypocrisy and deceit; a victim to the venomedsting of the slanderer! O God! I know it all, now."- "Percy Hamilton, are you mad?" almost shrieked Mrs. Grant. Leave my house " he exclaimed, turning suddenly upon her, with the frenzied look of a madman. If I am not so, no thanks to you or yours; and I warn you, madam, never set foot within my doors again!" "I will seek my child," she said, fear and passion making her face livid. "I will not leave her alone to meet the un- merited reproaches of one who has evidently lost his senses." "Do so," he said, scornfully. "She will need another les- son in deceit, upon awaking; but, I warn you, venture not into my presence again.;" She glided through the door, ere the sentence was half fin- ished; and went with her exaggerated account to her daugh- ter's room; while Percy, exhausted and agonized by con- flicting emotions, flung himself upon a couch, and lay for two     108       CARRIE EMERSON. hours in a state between sleep and stupor. The noise of a carriage aroused him, and mechanically he approached the window. Presently, he saw Mrs. Grant, supporting her daugh- ter; who, closely muffled, seemed unable to support herself. They entered the carriage; two large travelling trunks were strapped on, and he listened to the order, "Home, James." "Thank God! The calculating old Jezebel has spared me another scene!" and he returned to his couch, to dream over again the miserable past, along with the more miserable fu- ture. "There is a name upon the stone- Alas! and can it be the same- The young, the lovely, and the loved? It is too soon to bear thy name. Too soon! O no, 't is best to die Ere all of life, save breath, is fled! Why live, when feelings, friends, and hopes, Have long been numbered with the dead?" That evening, when Carrie Emerson, as usual, took her solitary ramble to the church-yard, she was surprised to see a stranger; who, as she approached, moved off a few paces, and, though apparently busied deciphering some old and time-worn grave-stones, was, she was soon aware, intently watching her.* As she caught his wild, restless glance, and noticed how death- ly pale was the high, open brow, and sorrow-stricken face, she began to feel uneasy; and, anxious to get through with her task, she threw down a basket full of sweet wild flowers, and, seating herself, began twining a wreath for Ellen's grave. The stranger drew near her, and, bowing slightly, bade her good-evening.   CARRIE EMERSON'          109 She returned his salutation, scarcely raising her eyes from her work; while, with the freedom of an old acquaintance, and the suavity and gentleness of a perfect gentleman, he requested permission to assist her in her task. "Whom is it for?" he asked, as he busied himself with the flowers and buds. "For Ellen Grant," she answered, sadly; "a very dear fiiend of mine." "You loved her very much, if I may judge by the pains you have taken to beautify her last resting-place," he said, in a voice so low, it was scarcely audible. "Loved her! Yes, every one loved Ellen Grant who knew her!" "How long had she lived here?" "About a year." "Do her relatives'live here?" "She had no very near relatives," said Carrie, wondering  why a stranger should take such an interest. "Do you know anything of her history?" "I do," said Carrie. "She confided it to me the night before she died." "Would you repeat it to me here upon her grave?"     ; "I would not like to, sir. Why should a stranger interest  himself about one of whom very little is known, and for  whom no one seriously mourns?" "I knew her, lady, and there is a deep and mournful interest connected with her history. If she confided in you, the name of Percy Hamilton is not wholly unknown to you." With a wondering look Carrie let fall the wreath, and, 10      "O       CARRIE EMERSON.  moving off a few paces, stood irresolutely before him, as if  half a mind to flee the place. , Why do you look so at me, young lady? Whom or what do you take me for?"     ;               ! r, The murderer of Ellen Grant! for she died of a broken heart. As the husband of a soulless devotee of fashion!  What brought you here?" she added, almost sternly.     ; Percy threw himself upon the fresh-turned sod, and for a  few moments gave way to his bitter grief. When he grew  calmer, Carrie seated herself again, and, without heeding his suppressed anguish, commenced giving him the history of Ellen, word for word, as she had heard it from her own lips.  When she had finished, she rose to leave- the spot. Thus far he had listened without a word. He sprang upon his feet. Every drop of blood seemed receding from his face, and he laid a hand, cold and clammy as death, upon her own. "Who are you?" at length he gasped. "bIy name is Emerson; Carrie Emerson." , "And you have seen sorrow, young and fair as you are! Even now, you are suffering under something heavier and harsher than the removal of one, who only added one link more to the chain friendship has woven for you. Suffering makes us clear-sighted. My dear young lady, never, never let the sting of detraction influence your young heart! Try to think of me as one more sinned against than sinning. I leave you to the task of beautifying this cherished- spot. Sometimes in your prayers remember Percy Hamilton! Let our sad fate be a warning.! The recollection of this hour may save me from the horrors of madness. I would to God I were sleeping here too; but not as a reckless suicide!"   CARRIE EMERSON.          1 ,Upon his return home, he found a haughty missive from Mrs. Grant: "When Mr. Percy Hamilton has returned to his senses, and made all necessary apologies, Mrs. Hamilton will return home; but not until then.           E. G." "Humph!" said Percy, "it will be long ere I apologize. Let her stay with those she finds more congenial." It may be thought such conduct was cruel and unnatural. Let it be remembered Percy's eyes had been cruelly, sud- denly opened to a tissue of deceit and wrong, if uncommon, -and I am not so sure about that, - not, alas! unnatural. There are more widow Grants than one in the world, and, though I dislike to say it, very many Angelas. A few weeks followed of calm, sober misery, and then all the fashionables of the city were astonished at the announce- ment of an elopement in high life, in the "Post." "Signor Gregoria Garcia,-a young and handsome Span- iard, who had been on intimate terms at her mother's fbr some time previous,- and Mrs. Percy'Hamilton, wife, of a highly respectable young merchant of B." Probably the whole city was aware of the fact before it came to Percy's ears. He was alone in his library, reading the papers which had 'lain since morning. Turning over the sheet, as if it were impossible for anything to interest him more, his eye was suddenly arrested by the above paragraph. He began to pace-the room with nervous steps. "A deuced pretty denouement!" he muttered through his set teeth.      "2       CARRIE EMERSON. "Signor Garcia, if I knew which way you were travelling,  . I 'd send you a letter of congratulation, with my thanks for giving me the freedom I longed for--the right to mourn without compromising my honor as a married man. "I wonder if Mrs. Grant will come in for her share of public scandal. By George! she ought to figure in full    j dress, among the dramatis personcz. I have a great mind to  show her up myself. Who could do it better? seeing I have had a full share of her matchless manoeuvring." Then, sink-  ing into a rich cushioned chair, and leaning his head upon the table, he muttered, "But what have I to do with aught in life?" Another week, and the beautiful mansion of Percy Hamil- ton was sold at auction. Scandal was at the highest point of delightful interest. The young husband came in for a large amount of censure;  Irs. Grant having taken care that rumor, with its thousand tongues, should have the full benefit  of her version of the story. Percy, meantime, was making rapid preparations to travel; rumor said in search of his lost treasure. He felt as if, for once, rumor spoke truth; but it was not after Angela. He felt more like seeking Ellen in a happier world. The day before he started on his tour he was introduced, by a mere chance, to E wavrd Ashley. In the course of con- versation, some reference was made to Cliftonville. Percy grew suddenly interested, and, without seeming, led Edward to speak with enthusiasm of his beautiful residence. "I used to know a young lady who lately died there," said Percy. "Did you, indeed! Who was she?"   CARRIE  EMERSON.        113 "Her name was Grant." "O, yes!" said Edward. "Ihave a young friend who took a deep interest in her. I suspect there was some secret sym- pathy between them; for, though all the young ladies were more or less attached to Ellen Grant as their teacher, Carrie Emerson seemeddrawn by a closer tie." A few adroit questions put Percy in possession of what was most interesting to him - a brief history of Carrie, and a more definite one of Henry Irving. The young men parted mutually pleased with each other, and the next day Percy had bid adieu to a few affectionate and sympathizing friends, and was alone with his misery; alone amidst a crowd, mak- ing his way across the Atlantic.     CHAPTER X. CIIAPTER X. Changeful and faint was her fair cheek's hue, Though clear as a flower which the light looks through, And the glance of her dark, resplendent eye, For the aspect of woman at times too high, Lay floating in mists, which the troubled stream Of the soul sent up o'er its fervid beam. HEMANS. They deem thee passionless, cold and proud, And it suits thee well to know That the icy surface so well can shroud The-deep feeling that sleeps below. "W ELL, Adde, how comes on the wooing?" said a young lady, entering without ceremony the spacious drawing-room of Col. Macy.  "I heard a few minutes ago Mr. Ashley was in town, and I thought I would come and see if I was likely to get the bracelet." Adelaide Macy bit her lip, and a deep flush suffused her check, but she quickly mastered whatever of emotion it was, and answered, calmly, "I hardly think, if all stories are true, he will trouble himself to call upon me!"   CARRIE EMERSON.          115 Why, Adde; what 's the matter? It is n't a week since you told me he was coming. I thought, of course, you were on good terms. You have n't quarrelled; because, if you have, I must act the part of peace-maker. I can't afford to lose the bracelet!" "Get a beau, yourself, Eva, and I shall get the bracelet." "O, no! that won't do. But what is the matter, Adde? Won't you tell me?"  Read that," said her companion, handing her a letter. "Anonymous, hey? I would n't have anything to do with it. It was only done to tease you. Some envious person, I dare say." "Did you read the enclosed one?" Yes." "Well, that is in Edward's own hand-writing; there is no disputing it. 'Tired of me, and would. like to get rid of me!"He won't find it very hard work. He is too presum- ing altogetSr." "I cannot believe it, Adde. -Ir. Ashley is too gentle- manly to stoop to any such thing." ' O, I 've had confirmation strong, Eva! You know Mrs. Hilton?" ;"Yes, certainly." "Well, a short time since, she spent a few days at Clifton- ville, and she saw enough with her own eyes to convince any one less exacting than I am." A ring at the door, and Mr. Ashley sent up his card. Not at home to him," said Miss Adelaide, giving it a toss into the card-receiver. "There's assurance for you, Eva! I 'll teach him that he     "6       CARRIE EMERSON. has carried the joke quite far enough. If his father is very anxious about the pounds and pence, he 'll have to find a sub- stitute for his hopeful son. Before any one shall have me for my money, I'll give it to found hospitals and orphan asylums." "That's right, Adde," said her father, coming in at the moment. "Teach him a good lesson, even if he does not de- serve it, which I doubt. If you lay anything to heart, you are not a Macy." "I lay anythiing to heart!" said the girl, with a lip whose quivering motion sadly belied the assertion. Trust me, fatlher, I slall never die of a broken heart." , Ilight again, Addje We e'1 be off to Saratoga next week, and you shall dance and sing with the merriest of them." A little more trifling chit-chat, and the friends parted. The colonel, in a casual way, took particular pains to give the supposed delinquenlt his fuill share. " 3arr my daughter " he said to one gentleman, who had asked if there was not all engagement between the young people. "Preposterous idca! You know there are always plenty of hangers-on, with an eye to the settlements; but the gentleman that catches my bird will have to comb more highly recommended than Mr. Ashley ever can, I 'll assure you." "Bless me!" said another, "I thought it was a settled thing. I heard so from good authority." "Must n't believe all you hear, my good friend. That young" man has a very imaginative disposition. I should n't be surprised if he had told some such story himself. He's full of fun and frolic; anything for the sake of a joke. But I 'll teach him not to couple his name with that of my daugh- ter, again, the popinjay!"   CARRIE EMERSON.         'll7 The old gentleman bowed and walked away, wondering whether it was the fault of memory, or a trick his imagina- tion had served him. He really thought, however, he had heard Col. Maoy speak in high terms of young Mr. Ashley as a favored suitor; and Miss Adelaide always seemed pleased with his attentions; he would n't be bluffed out of that, any way. Eva called upon Mrs. Hilton, on her way home. "Just  think of the effrontry of :3r. Ashley, to call upon Adde, after what he has done."  "Well, of course he don't think she has heard of it." "Of course not; but I should think his conscience would be enough." "How does Adde feel about it?" O, she don't care; she's going to Saratoga next week. There are plenty of admirers there, and she 'll manage to have her share. Between you and I, Mrs. Hilton, she is destitute of what Mr. Ashley thought she possessed; and that's a  heart. Why, I know, if they were not positively engaged, they only had not spoken the words; and she don't care a fig about it. I should be ashamed to let any one know I [was so heartless." "Nonsense! that was all done to deceive you, Eva!De- pend upon it, she cares just as much as you or I would ;-nly they are so high-strung. But you see if pride don't have a fall. Father says Col. Macy was down town this mornidg, insinuating that Mr. Ashley was n't capable of transacting some business he came oh.1 Why, if his father did n't -know him to be competent he would n't send him." -     "8       CARRI E EMERSON. "( I wonder what he would say, if he knew his letter to an. other had missed its destination, and found its way here?" I don't know what he would say; but I think there was a providence il it. Girls can't be too careful. Just think of Mrs. Hamilton ; if she had studied his disposition, what a world of misery I would have saved! I wouldn't laugh at Adde. Hemenlber there may be another actor behind the scenes; there are some who would do it. Besides, if Edward wrote that letter, why did it not reach itsproper destination?  And as to anonymous ones, no good ever came of one yet. They are ever the presages, or the actual demonstrations, of evil." "Sure enough. I'll try and make Adde think it possible, at least. I was wrong to speak of her as I did." "And so was I, Eva. We must learn to bridle our tongues. If every one did so, one half the misery in the world would cease to exist. Good-by, Eva." I am well acquainted with young Ashley," said Mr. Hil- ton, " and, if I thought he would lay it to heart much, I 'd try and set the matter right. There is some kind of by-play there, depend upon it." The good intention of Mr. Iinton was frustrated. Mr. Ashley had left town. Another week, and Col. Macy, his son and daughter, were located at Saratoga for the remainder of the season. If any change were visible in Adelaide, it was only that she was more dignified than usual; and there was a haughty reserve, that repelled any attempt to cultivate more than a casual acquaintance. Some thought it scorn; and there may have been good reason for the supposition. All at once, too, she   CARRIE EMERSON.         L  119 seemed to have a passion for books, which to her brother was very annoying, he believing gayety the best antidote for disap- pointment or chagrin. Her father looked on with a self-satisfied, consequential air, and "She is a true Macy," was the thought that oftenest pre- sented itself. He forgot that the heart may be cased in a triple armor of pride, yet remain keenly susceptible to even the slightest shadow of neglect; that there are a thousand ways in which rumor may send home. the poisoned thrust of detraction. For my own part, I 'd rather cope with all the thousand ills Which poverty nlay marshal in its train; I 'd rather drink the cup which woe distils, E'en though each drop were maddening to the brain; 'l I 'd rather wrestle with the hand of fate, E'en though its iron fingers left the brand; I 'd rather battle with the envious hate Of Satan's minions with my single hand, Than come in contact with the meanest thing That-ever cursed the earth with its foul name O, Slander! Slander! may thy scorpion sting Return to scorch the bosom whence it came! ( Come, Ad., lay aside your book; I 'm going to intro- duce you to an old classmate bf mine just arrived; so go and make your toilet. The fresh breeze has been playing witch- work with your curls; and my friend is a critique." "A  fig for his criticism! I don't care to please him, George," she said with a studied smile, her eyes still bent upon the page. "Then I must take it per force," he said gayly, suiting the action to the word, and leading her unresistingly away.     120       CA R IE E M R S ON. When she returned to the parlor she was introduced to our old fiiend, Allan Winsor. "Where have you been the last six months? and how came you here?" said George. "You are not through?" "'Through! you are hard on me, George. Why, your voyage out south has made you lose in memory what you re- gained in health. Why, we are only sophs., young gentle- man.  As to where I've been-rusticating, of course, in the pretty little village of Cliftonville. How I came to be here, was to meet a chosen friend, Edward Ashley, Esq. But he seems to have forgotten his part of the arrangement, for assuredly he is not here." "Perhaps he has a lady-love," said George, with a depre- cating glance at his sister, - but her cheek was proof against even one shade deeper than its wont, -"and she may have detained him." "I think not," said Allan. "If Ashley has a lady-love, most likely he expected to meet her here; at least I judged so from a few hints he let drop." "Are there many pretty girls in Cliftonville?" said George. " Plenty of them, George." "I was introduced to a young lady a while ago from there, and was told she was the belle. I was n't very much pleased with her style, but suppose it was owing to my want of taste." "What was her name?" "Atherton. Bel Atherton, I think." "Bel Atherton! Nonsense! She could n't bear comparison with Carrie Emerson any way, either as regards beauty or ac- complishments. And the generality of people think so too." "Allan Winsor thinks so, no doubt," said George, laugh-   CARRIE EMERSON.          12. ing. "Am I too pointed, Allan?  If so, pray excuse me. But I have too much of mother Eve's propensity, I believe." "Not at all, George; I am somewhat affected myself, so am willing to gratify all laudable whims upon the subject. There- fore, if Carrio Emerson had not been previously engaged, I should certainly have put in a claim for her hand and heart." "And who is the favored suitor?" "Henry Irving; at present in California." "I suppose that is the reason your friend Ashley didn't carry off the belle. You see I judge your friend's taste by your own." "Ed. Ashley! ha! ha! That's a pretty good one! Why,  he 'd just as soon think of marrying his sister! They are old schoolnates; have been ever since they were knee high. He regards her, I know, with true brotherly affection; noth- ing more. I wish it were so, for Ed. is a capital fellow; but so is Irving, for the matter of that." The conversation soon took another turn, and at the first opportunity Adelaide left the friends to enjoy their cigars and talk over their college reminiscehces unrestrainedly. Alone, in the solitude of her chamber, she'could weep. But such was not her mood. She sat down calmly to reflect. The mischief was done; but was it irremediable? It was, if - one word from Adelaide Macy was requisite to reinstate the delinquent, as she had schooled her heart to regard him! If he loved her, as she had been led to believe he did, why did he not seek an explanation? Conscience might have whispered, His pride rnms parallel with yours, Miss Adde! Perhaps it did; but she was -not " S     12)2       CA RRIE EMERSON. going to have a quarrel with pride. Not that there was any fear of being defeated; but prudence whispered, It is better not. So Miss Adelaide must needs 'bide her time. She went to the mirror; gave a scrutinizing glance, to see if one trace of restless feeling dare linger on the surface, and, satisfied and fortified, she went down to mingle again with the heartless and deep-feeling, the gay and the serious, the true worshipper at nature's holiest shrine and the gaudy butterfly of fashion's gilded saloons; the lovers of truth and white-robed charity, and, must I write it, that worst bane of society, - the scandal-monger! It is useless to contend that it is only among the low and ignorant the subtle and wily reptile is to be found. Its venom- ous sting comes with even more deadly force from the pol- ished and refined.   CHAPTER XI.

BYnON. IT was a hot, sultry afternoon; not a cloud of the size of a man's hand to denote the approach of the much-wished-for shower. Everything was drying up; there would certainly be a famine. There was a dearth, too, among the gossiping part of the community. Strange to say, fate had not favored them for the last two or three weeks. Scandal was at its lowest ebb. But the " hush often precedes the tempest; " and the old lady said, "  It never rains but it pours." "  The Eldriches have got company," said Mrs. Buncombe to herself. "I'll put on my white cape bonnet, and take my work, and step over, and sit with them a while. They'll w.                  12-1       C A Il I E; E R 1  SON. tliink I did n't know it. I should hate to have them think nnc intrusive; but I do long to hear if anything has been  found out in a certainl (uarter." Just then the pennly post put a letter into her hand. She ran }her eve over the contents, then gave way to one of her diabolical laughs ; land, crushinlg it together, put it into her pocket, and lhastened over to have a chat with the Eldriches. "Excuse me, I did n't know you had company; but I am so lonesome!" "O, Mrs. Buncombe! you know we are always delighted to see you. Allow me to introduce you to the Misses Ham- met. 'I'ity are from I., and have seen Ed. Ashley's lady- love." Indeed!" said Mrs. Buncombe, her black eyes sparkling with eager delight, and coming to the point at once. ' Pray give me a descriltion of her. Is she pretty?" She is called very handsome," said the elder Miss atlm- nmct; "but, though I 've seen her frequently, I must own I never thought her anything uncommon. She 's horrid proud- that I know ; and so are all the rest of the Macys. The colonel is a pompous, purse-proud old fellow as you 'll find among a thousand. And his son is about as conceited a sprig of aristocracy as you will find anywhere." 4 But the daulghter," said Mrs. lBuncombe. "Do give us a description of her!

"And'don't you know what the reason was?" "I heard, -you know such things will creep out, - that it was partly on account of an anonymous letter she received, informing her of his attentions to a certain young lady of this place. When he called she refused to see him, and served him right too. A man has no right to trifle with any woman's affections." "Pretty good for Ed. Ashley!" said Mrs. Buncombe with a sarcastic grin. "Does he know what the trouble was?" "I don't know, I 'm sure. Do you, Sue?" "Yes, I know; but it will hardly do to tell." "O, do tell!" said Mrs. Buncombe, rubbing her hands with glee. "It must be interesting to hear what he says." "I 'm afraid one of the party won't find it very interesting," said Susan. (My brother is an attorney, and Mr. Ashley has authorized him to act for him. There is positive proof of letters being subtracted, missives written, and I can't tell what amount of scandal set afloat. You know a story never loses anything in the repetition." "What does he wish your brother to do?" "O, simply to drop a line to the person, -I don't know whether it was a man or woman, - and warn them to be care- ful. It is rather dangerous business, I should think." "*     126       C A RRIE EM ERSo N. ( It is so," said the elder Miss Hammct. "And so you don't know who the suspected person is?" said Mrs. Buncombe. "No, I don't. But, whoever it is, I advise him or her to be careful. There is trouble in store." "Who! Who cares for Ed. Ashley?" said Mary Eldrich. "I need n't think, because he has a rich father, he's too good to be looked at." "Why, no," chimed in Lu. "No one here cares a fig for him, except Carrie Emerson. And because she happens to be pretty good-looking, and holds her head pretty high, he has come to the conclusion that he can beau her round, make her presents, write her letters, lavish all sorts of attentions upon her, and no one must say a word." I shall say, or think, just what I please," said Mrs. Bun- combe. "I should like to know who the Emersons think they are! I have not forgiven them, yet, for their conduct to me. Why, they turned away, with as much cool contempt, the other day, when they saw me coming, and crossed over to the other side, as if I had been infected with the plague!  "I heard," said Lu., "(that the little boy called you the Backbiter; and classed you among the curiosities he was enumerating." ( The young rascal!" said the now thoroughly exasperated Mrs. Buncombe. ( I'1l pay him for that! I 'll scald his dog, or kill his pet bantam, or tear up all his favorite flowers! I've served many a one such tricks,- and they never found me out. Who told you?" ( O, I heard of it! Ed. Ashley had something to say about it. he said you w\ouldn't bear comparison, even with the old s-scerllet."   CARRIE EMERSON.          127 There was a laugh at the expense of Mrs. IBtcombe. Who could help it?- the idea was so. comical. But, if the Eldriches thought they would go unpunished, it was a gross mistake. "Have you heard from Tom, lately?" she said, in hopes of changing the topic. "Yes-had a letter yesterday. He says Henry Irving was doing a first-rate business, when, all of a sudden, he left, and, as near as he could find out, came home. Tom teased him considerably with an account of the flirtation; and says, by the time he gets back again, he is in hopes to get something from you. You are so much better at dressing up a thing than we are, it would go first-rate. I wish you would; it would serve Carrie Emerson just right,-a proud, haughty. thing! Why, I really do think she feels above us, too. She never turns her head when she goes by here. I should like to know what we've done to her." "She don't go out often," said Hester Rand. "I meet her, once in a while, going to the church-yard." "All a sham," said Mary. "She cared no more for Ellen Grant than you or I did. I suppose she considers it romantic to sit there, and muse, and weave chaplets, as she calls them; or repeat poetry, and entertain strange gentlemen into the bargain. I was going by there, one afternoon, and she sat there, just as unconcerned, and talking as earnestly as if it were Ed. Ashley." "Is it possible, Mary?" "Yes, it just is possible. I declare, I thought it scandal- ous! If you, or I, or Mrs. Buncombe, had done it, 't would have beend a shocking affair. I'm not a bit sorry for the     128       CARR IE EMERSON. share I had in breaking up the friendship, if that's all it was, between her and Henry Irving. I should like to do it between her and Ed. Ashley, now." "For my part," said Lu., "I glory in it." ( Then it was you were the means of the estrangement," said Hester. "Yes; but you must n't say a word about it, Hester. They're neighbors, you know; and we don't want to make any trouble, openly. Mother knows nothing about it. She'd be very angry if she did. She thinks everything of them." "You had nothing to do with writing the missive, I hope, Mary',' said Miiss IIamlllt. "N o, I did not. I was knowing to it, though; and I don't see what great harm there was in it. It is no worse than to send a valentine; and everybody does that. Besides, if Miss Macy is as proud, and haughty, and detestable, as you say she is, it is just good enough for her. And, as to Ed. Ashley, he deserves something worse than that. If he had n't flirted abominably with Carrie, and wrote her silly letters, it would n't have happened."                    ) "How do you know he did?" said the diplomatic Miss H v "O, because I saw it, myself." "Did Miss Emerson show it to you?" Another boisterous laugh from Mrs. Buncombe, who seemed to enjoy the interrogatories greatly. O, she was denied the pleasure of reading it, to be sure! It fell into other hands." "Yours?" said Miss Hammet. "No. Mrs. Bluncombe got it first, and she showed it to me. I wish I had taken a copy of it; it was a document worth preserving."   C A RR IE E I ERSON.       129 (, But how did you manage, Mrs. Buncombe? I should n't dare to do such a thing, for fear of being found out." O, that's easy enough!" said Mrs. Buncombe; who, in her anger and interest, wholly forgot Miss Hammet'sf brother was an attorney, and that his letter of warning was in her pocket. So she went on to describe how she came in posses- sion of Ed.'s letter; how she managed to find out Miss Macy's address; and, finally, how she had longed to know the result. It was not until she returned home that the idea came into her mind. When it did, she was in an agony of fear and doubt. "What shall I do?" she exclaimed to her husband. "Do you think they will commence a suit against me?" "Fools if they don't!"' said Mr. B. "How many times have I told you that your tongue would be the ruin of you? I tell you, candidly, I won't try to screen you any longer." "Had n't I better go out of town, and stay a few weeks, till it blows over?" "Yes; and learn, while you are gone, to bridle your tongue," said the justly incensed Buncombe. "If you don't, I shall serve you a trick the devil never did --I 'll run away from you!" "Spunk, to the back-bone, Bill! I thought you had a little courage, else I would n't have married you." "If I had been a coward I should not have caught a tar- tar. As it is, if I succeed in taming you, I ought to have a premium." I 'll let you know you have n't a very easy task before you. .To tell the truth, I only married you to get rid of you. Do you understand that?-or are you more dull of compre-     130       CARRIE EMERSON. hension than usual? And I calculate to have my own way. If it was n't for one thing, more than another, I wouldn't stir one inch." "If you stay here, madam, you'll have to keep shady. If you go out of town, perhaps you can manage to raise a breeze somewhere else, just to keep busy." "W1ell, what's the odds, if you can't help it, Bill? Ha! ha! ha! Don't get mad." "For pity's sake, cease making use of by-words, and low, vulgar expressions! It mortifies me almost to death." "There! I hear enough such lectures, when any of your folks come here. I always do it the more because I know it nettles them." "But why can you not rise above such things? I have n't been used to it. My mother is a very particular woman." ( Pity you did n't find me out sooner!" "It is so. If you had only once shown that cloven foot of yours, you imp of mischief, you would have done me an in- valuable service! As it is, if you would only curb that ugly, spiteful temper, I would try and make the best of a bad bar- gain." A scornful, derisive laugh, and a coarse, taunting jest, was more than the husband could well put up with; and, turning on his heel, and shutting the door with a loud bang, he left her to commence preparations for a hasty journey. In a few minutes, Mary Eldrich called. So you are going away, Mrs. Buncombe?" "Yes; though William hates to have me go, he will be so lonesome! I dare say he 'll be coming to bring me home, before I've half made my visit."   CARRIE EMER SN.         131 ( I did n't think you were in earnest, yesterday, when you said you'd go. I would n't care for the Emersons, or Ed. Ashley, either. I don't believe they 'll trouble you if you keep still." "O Lord! you don't suppose that's why I'm going? Pho! nonsense! my health is getting poor. The doctor says I 'm bilious, and must have a change." "You forgot, yesterday, when you boasted of what you'd been about, that the Hammets' brother was an attorney, and was engaged to transact some business for Ed. Ashley pretty much like this, did n't you?" "Well, that was nothing to me, Mary. Perhaps you think I got a lawyer's letter; but I did n't, I declare." Mary smiled incredulously. Mrs. Buncombe reddened with anger. "I vow," she said, hastily folding a dress, "I hate this place with a mortal hatred! I 'll be hanged if you can do the least thing in the world but everybody knows it. If I thought it possible, I'd try and set every one together by the ears in the whole neigh- borhood. I should n't want any better fun." "I should think you'd hate to get yourself into any more trouble;" said Mary. "Who, for the Lord's sake, is in trouble? I hope to mercy you don't think I am!" Mary began to think the place was getting too hot for her, and took a hasty leave, coming to the conclusion that the less she had to do with such people the better. "Did you hear that, Maggy?" said Mrs. Buncombe, push- ing open the kitchen door, and accosting a raw specimen of the Emerald Isle. O     132       CARRIE  EMERSON. "Faith an' I did, ma'am; an' if I were ye, I'd be after breaking the heads of sich like.

"An' is it a backbiter ye 'd be afther making me? I belave that's what they call 'em.

"O, you're all alike, you good-for-nothing, ignorant Paddy!  A set of turncoats-regular hypocrites! If my health was n't really suffering, I'd turn you, neck and heels, right out of doors!" exclaimed her incensed mistress. "Good Lord! I thought she hated them as bad as I do; when she turns short round and begins to taunt me, and gives me her advice - a good-for-nothing, impudent hussy! Her advice! And that 's just all I've got for being so free with her, and taking her into my confidence! Like as not she 'll go and tell all she knows.

CHAGT OF CORRINNE AT THE CAPITOL What is the tale that I would tell? not one Of strange adventure, but a common tale Of woman's wretchedness ; one to be read Daily, in many a young and blighted heart. "ANDON. "ARE ye long over?" is the question that first finds its way to the lips of the Irishman, when he first welcomes a son or daughter of the green isle. "You 'll find nothing so beau- tiful in this land o' liberty as our own blessed Erin." It was the thought that naturally suggested itself to Percy Hamnilton, as he noticed a stranger, and an American, oppo- site him at table, one day, after a short excursion among the fertile and beautiful scenery in the vicinity of Valambrosa. Satisfied that earth could boast of nothing more glorious than   CARRIE EMERBSON.         135 what the most enthusiastic might meet at every turn in Italy, there wanted yet the charm of home to make it perfect, even though there were associated with it the most bitter and heart-rending recollections. Percy longed to ask a few ques- tions, as the image of his own loved country rose up before him; but the stranger was moody and taciturn, and, with a true sympathetic feeling, he respected the silence he dared not intrude upon. With a disappointed and disheartened look, he shut himself up in his own room, to brood over again, with unmitigated regret, the agonizing scenes he had so lately passed-through. He had come with restless step to sun himself in far-famed, glorious Italy. With an eager eye he had gazed, day after day, upon its wide-spread, unsurpassed scenery. Its classic shades; its sweet, entrancing music; the soul-inspiring poetry of its every-day life,-all had become familiar, and, he had vainly tried to think, necessary to his very existence; yet happiness, or, at least, repose, was as far as ever from his mind. Of late he had become more tranquil, and he flat- tered himself the wound was beginning to heal, when the arrival of the last new-comer had put to flight the half- formed hope. It was not, of course, a rare thing to meet and exchange salutations with his own countrymen; on the contrary, it was a thing of very frequent occurrence; but there was a some- thing in the countenance of the young man'that attracted and interested him powerfully. There was a mournful expression about the face he could not define. The full, dark eye had lost none of its brilliancy, but it was downcast and repelling. There was, too, a bright     136       CARRIE EMERSON. flush upon the check, which quivered and faded at intervals. There was a tremulous, nervous motion about the lips, that spoke of suffering, and there was a slow, inanimate motion to the whole figure, that betokened a crushed and bleeding heart. With a feeling of curiosity too powerful to be overcome Percy plushled his inquiries far enough to ascertain that the young man had no definite plans for the next few weeks, and had1 arranged to remain at the hotel for some time. Trusting that the rest he appeared so much in need of would restore the traveller, and that upon his return he would find him more communicative and companionable, Percy left, to pursue alone his restless search of peace and repose among the wild scenery of the surrounding country. he had entered a small, unostentatious-looking inn by the roadside, and was amusing himself with a pretty child, when he heard the sound of a familiar voice in an adjoining apart- Ilnelt. It is cruel of you to leave me alone so often among such a set of boors! I can't understand a word they say, and it is so tedious I never know what to do with myself." "You might amuse yourself by studying their language. You ought to have done so in your own country." "Well, I did study it a little, and what good did it do, pray? I can't remember a single word of it now, if I ever knew one." "; Aburd! Why did you go to school? But we will go to Spain ; I 'm tired of this incessant worrying and fault-find- illO f' "I don't believe I shall like Spain any better. Why not go to England?"   CARRIE EMERSON.          137 "Are you dreaming? You want to run the risk of meet- ing with that crazy-headed husband of yours, do you? Your mother should have taught you how to steal a march better than tfat. She's a very skilful general-hey, Angela?" "If she had been, I should not have been pining away in a foreign land." "Pining? beautiful one! I thought the roses on your cheeks were real ones. You don't look much the worse for your premeditated flight." "What do you mean by that?" was uttered in a low, scornful tone. "Do you mean to insinuate that I expected or wished such a proposal, when I listened to your protesta- tions of sympathy and friendship?" "No, dearest, but depend upon it your mother did. She thought I was young, and needed some one to take care of me and help me spend my time and money. And so I did; but if I wander occasionally, you must n't blame me. It is a pretty habit of coquetting I learned from you. I often wondered how I should feel, if your husband should sur- prise us in some of our stolen interviews, or sentimental, semi-serious flirtations, enacted in pantomime beneath the smiling eye of your lady mother. He must have been wil- fully blind, or partially deranged, -not to have seen what was going on. I begin to think he was very glad to get rid of you in the way he did, else he would have pursued you long ere this." "If it were not for the scandal, we might go back again. I might obtain a divorce, and we should be much happier honorably married." "O, I thought you soon got tired of the matrimonial 12*     138       CARRIE EMERSON. chains! If you should find a greater fool than I am, you would n't have so much trouble in leaving men." "How you allow yourself to run on!" said Angela, faintly. "If I loved you one jot the less, I should be very, very an- gry," glancing up at the dark face of her companion, with a sweet smlile. "But come, love, the dinner-bell has sounded; let us away." IPery's heart might have throbbed with more than one outraged ieCling; no doubt it did, while listening to this tirale ; but he had contrived to smother it all ; and, with the calm bearing of a perfect gentleman, he entered the room, and took his seat at the table exactly opposite Angela and her heartless paramour. The practised eye of the Spaniard soon put to flight any fear of the right to his treasure being disputed, and he turned to his companion, to see how she bore the presence of one she had so cruelly wronged; but she 1hd ftiinted. It was the most opportune thing in the world; there was a general movement; restoratives were applied, and she was borne in the arms of Garcia to her chamber. Once, while she remained inanimate, the curiosity of the minor predominated, and he ventured to look where he could catch a glimlpse of Percy; who, whatever might have been tlhe state of his mind, sat calmly eating his dinner, as if he were the most uninterested person living. Gaircia was confounded. He had half a mind to quarrel with himl for his equanimity. "Devil take the follow!" he muttered; "I have a notion of presenting ny card. I be- liev e li actually thinks himself in another world, and has forgotten even his own existence. Wonder how it would do to step in and tell him I'll relinquish my claimn to the lady;   CARRIE EMER SON.        '  139 and then leave him to restore her to life, and take better care of her in future. "I 'll just step in and see how she is. I wish hle hadn't made his appearance just then. I'mi devilish hungry; and that fainting fit was no sham, any way." But if he had reckoned upon a quarrel with Percy H-amil- ton, or had concluded to shift the burden off his hands, and consign it to its legitimate owner, he had for once reckoned without his host. Percy had settled with the landlord, entered the lumbering coach, unmindful of its destination, so it bore him from an atmosphere so tainted, and was far away from the spot, long ere Angela had recovered from the shock, or Garcia had con- cluded how he would play his part. A violent fit of weeping succeeded the long and deadly faint, while Garcia paced the room, muttering curses upon the stoical calmness of a man who could bat his dinner, and, like Lochinvar, "ride away," while he was considering whatf was best to do. But the low, smothered sob had grown to a wild, hysterical shriek, and Signior Garcia's patience was fast evap- orating, if one might judge from the rapid-and wrathful enunciation, brimful of meaning. "I 'll tell you what it is, Mrs. Percy Hamilton," he mut- tered through his set teeth, "if you don't stop that unearthly screaming, I'll follow your precious husband's example, and leave you to your fate. I 'm getting tired of su(h foolery." "Where shall we flee for safety?" sobbed Angela. "HI will surely murder us both." "Better go home to your mother. I don't believe she was     "O       CARR II   E E RI E r o N. ever at her wits' end in any kind of an emergency. She should have prepared you better." "Do you wish to leave me?" said the miserable Angela. "Where is all the adoration you so lately professed? Was it M}y fault that Percy chose to intrude his icy presence?" The pale, suffering look of calmness, that gradually over- spread her face, seemled to touch him, for he bent over her, alnd pressed his lips upon her marble brow. Tih- action was involuntary, and Ileant to express commiseration, but she did not heed it. All at once a mighty resolution seemed to hatve lifted her above the need of any such demonstrations. She arose firoml her recumbent posture, bathed her face in cool water, adjusted her dress, and even smiled as he approached to lead her into the open air. "Just like all women," he thought; "they are as variable as the wind. Next time she wants to have a scene, I 'll leave her alone. And now for the finale! Shall I shoot the ras- cal for giving me all this trouble? or will he dispose of mc as he would one of his bales of merchandise? "I would you were with your incomparable mother, sweet!" he said in a tone of bitter irony. "She helped get you into mischief; I 'd like her ready wit to get you out again. "After all," he muttered to himself, "it may make a wo- man of her; she has seemed somewhat like a waxen doll lately. I wish she would display some spirit; I'd put up witl it, even if it were a wicked one ; I hate milk-and-water tenllpers. P'rhaps, if I rouse her sufficiently, she'll request me to take her home. I 'll do it, by all the saints in the cal- endar! Match me for invention, Mrs. Grant! God bless the   CARRIE EMERSON.          141 woman! she wished me to consider her as my mother! B1ah! savors too much of intrigue. She ought to fill the post. of maid of honor to the queen. Some of the ladies would lose their places, I 'll bet. "What 's the matter, love?" he said coaxingly; "your fright seems to have frozen you. You-ought to consider you are in a warm climate; a passionate outhreak would be ten times-more to the purpose; 't was a sad mistake, Angela." Angela was silent, and the signior concluded he had wasted words enough for the present; so he conducted her to her chamber, and left her. If Angela had hitherto been all her companion chose to consider her, and worse even than that, a heartless, unthink- ing being, whose senses had been lulled to forgetfulness in luxury and indolence -who had lived only for herself-who had been left to the blind impulse of passion; she was awake now- frightfully, fearfully awake! The whole of her past life was one confused chaos. - She had never thought of a future. She had been as a puppet, ministering to the pleasures of a few-perhaps dreaming only of herself. She had stood before the altar, and linked her destiny with one, who, all high-minded and honorable as he was, had been swayed, through art and sophistry, to wrong another most cruelly. And that other, through ihe same subtle means, was sleeping in an early grave, crushet in spirit, broken in heart. The same web had been woven for another; she could not shut her eyes to the desperate manceuvring of her mother, or her own share in striving to win the passionate love that had led her astray. Was it love? Alas! too selfish and narrow- minded to understand the sentiment, she was awake to the     "2       CARRIE EMERSON. fearful conviction, that, whatever her fancy had made her be- lieve it was, it was fast flitting away. There was no vain, indulgent mother to whisper flattery and adulation in her car. There was no crowd of admirers to minister to her vanity, or to excite the jealousy of another. There was nothing to keep alive the novelty, and excitement of her position. She was no longer fleeing from a justly incensed husband. No fear of discovery, no need of secrecy. The screen had fallen; she stood alone -alone in her guilt! alone in her misery! Hopeless and helpless, what on earth had she to live for? If for a moment her thoughts glanced homeward, she shut her eyes upon the vision, and pride whispered, "Not there  O, 11! not there!" If hope rested one moment upon Garcia and the future, it faded as quickly before the recollection of his taunting jests; and she shrank with abhorrence from striving to conciliate and win back a short-lived passion, which a breath at 'any time would waft away. He despised her mother; would he not despise her? The scorn of the heartless, the sneer of the prudish, the pity of the compassionate -she shrank alike from it all! One by one came fliting by visions of the past: her luxuriant home, her pampered childhood, her shameful du- plicity in wilfully supplanting another; and, last of all, Per- cy! cold, stern, apparently unconscious even of her iden- tity, though she nmust have stood before him in the shape of destiny. Would they not assuredly seek each other, he and Garcia, and death to one of them be the inevitable conse- quence? She thought of Ellen Grant. Once, twice, perhaps thrice, a murderess!"O God!" she almost shrieked, cov.   CAR RIE EM ERSON.         143 ering her face with her spread hand; "save me, save me from the horrors of the past; and O, from the unknown future! I cannot, cannot meet it! No, rather death!" She gazed wildly around her for the means. She paced the room in bitter agony. Where was Garcia.? She sprang wildly through the open door, as the idea of meeting him, even once again, presented itself. He would soon return. She had no strength to battle with fate; no words to bandy with the heartless hypocrite, who had so suddenly thrown off the mask; who would not scruple to throw off the tie that bound him to her just as lightly. The one only wish for death impelled her onward. At a little distance from the spot flowed the Arno. As she sped along, its gentle murmur seemed to attract her footsteps, for she turned toward it, and, flitting forward, threw herself down upon the grassy bank. A little further off Signior Garcia was listlessly reclining, meditating how best to extricate himself from the uncomfortable predicament he felt himself to be in. He saw her at a distance, and, shutting his, eyes, and pre- tending sleep, waited her approach. Suddenly a splashing sound attracted and startled him, and, springing to his feet, he strained his eyes to catch a glimpse of the white garments of Angela; but she was nowhere to be seen. Trembling with an indefinite fear, he sank down upon the grass again, and for a few moments tried to think it a needless alarm, till, turning his eyes once more in the direction whence the sound issued, he saw distinctly a human face. There was a slight agitation, and then the waters closed above it. Horror- stricken, he fled to the house. One glance at the unoccupied room sent home conviction to his heart.

The wild, passionate grief of the young husband, as he was supposed to be, was well suited to the scene, and awakened the sympathy of the simple-hearted villagers, who followed her toki retired spot outside the cemetery; and there, though in unconsecrated ground, they poured the usual tribute of tears, and strewed the sweet wild flowers of their beautiful country over the suicide. A letter, which for duplicity would have matched Mrs. Grant, was immediately forwarded to that lady; and Garcia, a relieved, if not a repentant man, bade adieu to the place, wisely resolving never to be  made again the dupe of a match-making mother, or meddle with another's claims. Shortly after, a rumor reached Percy of the death of a young and beautiful English woman, as she was supposed to be; and, from a few inquiries, he came to know the truth. To say that he did not grieve for her sudden and untimely fate, would be to wroncg his nature cruelly. But to say that he sorrowed as for Ellen, would be equally unjust. There was no blighting sense of injury; no crushing of fond and treasured hopes; no rending of dear, long cherished ties. All such had been swept away long before; nothing was left him   but a deep and harrowing sense of regret. It was but the opening of an old wound afresh; bidding the smoth- ered fires break out anew.' It was horrible to think she had died by her own act; but it was better than to know she was living on in unblushing guilt   CARRIt E EMERSON.         145 and infamy, mingling with the pure-minded and honorable even as one of them. And Percy, with the deep sense of wrong they had wrought him still rankling in his bosom, and an abhorrence stronger than ever of the woman, who by her treachery and deceit had wrought hinm again this two-fold misery, after mak- ing the most minute inquiries, visiting the quiet restiong-place of Angela, and shedding tears of pity-and anguish over her blighted life, sat down calmly and dispassionately, and wrote her mother a long and circumstantial account of her daughter's t fate.  And she, in return, spread for him a tale of calumny, so ingenious, and so full of subtlety, that, though it were almost impossible to trace its foundation, lost not one particle of its strength or bitterness, and clung to him, though the ocean, and the lapse of weary months, almost years, came between him and its venomed sting. 13     CHAPTER     XIII.

BYRON'S PARASINI. SICK at heart, and sadly in need of rest, Percy returned to the beautiful retreat he had left in the vain hope of find- ing peace and perhaps a glimpse of happiness.  He was agreeably surprised to find the stranger, who had interested him so much, still an occupant of the home he had chosen. He was in no mood, however, to be inquisitive, and it was his own sad face that at present most strongly attracted attention. The house was thronged with visitors, and Percy, not wishing to come in contact with the bustle and hilarity that met him at every turn, took his meals alone, and went out upon his solitary rambles day after day, with only a passing bow, or a sad smile, or the exchange of a few cour- teous remarks.   CARRIE EMERSON.          147 One evening he had wandered further than usual, and was returning by a more frequented path, when he came upon a little party returning by the same way. They were just in advance of him, and he overheard them bantering a young lady upon her evident sympathy for some one of their acquaintance. She admitted the interest, but only upon the score of com- mon humanity.  She was sure Mr. Irving must have met with some severe disappointment; it was unnatural for one so young, and apparently so well calculated for enjoyment, to shut himself up in such armor of proof against it. "Irving?" said Percy to himself, and the image of Carrie Emerson floated before him, as it had done many times since the memorable evening when he sat with her upon the lowly grave of Ellen. Instead of taking his evening meal, as usual, in his own room, he took his seat at the public table, and entered into conversation with Irving. Satisfied it was the self-same one who, like himself, had been deceived, and by the same blind impulse had gone astray, he was determined, as far as lay in his power, to set the matter right. It would be but an act of justice; a performance of duty. After supper they strolled out to inhale the balmy air; and gradually the conversation turned from the beauties of nature, as spread out so abundantly before them, to the peculiarities of the people among whom they were sojourning. "What do you think of the women of this delightful land?" asked Irving, abruptly. "O, they are beautiful and fascinating; but one feels as if he could not trust himself to the witchery of their bright eyes! They are enthusiastic and warm-hearted; it is the     "8       CARRIE EMVERSON. characteristic of their country; and their coquetry is, I be- lieve, more harmless than that of our own country-women." 4( How so?" said Irving. "It is a curse, find it beneath what sky you will." "You are bitter," said Percy, smiling. "One would sup- pose you had been suffering under the infliction of some potent spell." They were silent a few moments, and then Percy asked, "( How do you like Miss Everett?" "The young lady who sat opposite us at supper?" "Yes." "( To tell the truth, I have hardly looked at her." ("Well, you ought; she appears to be quite interested in you." Does she? I believe I must cultivate her acquaintance; it will help pass away the time," said Irving, smiling faintly. "But what do you think of her?" "O, you have nothing to fear from me! I have steeled my heart against all woman-kind." Have you, indeed? One would hardly think the assertion possible; but, having come to the same conclusion pretty much, I 'll credit you. And now tell me, if you do not like Miss Everett's style of beauty, what does suit you?" "Let's see; a light, graceful figure- now mind you pay attention; because I mean you shall fall in love with the original, if you have not already. A light, graceful figure; moves like a sylph; oval face;,dark eyes, shaded and fringed by long lashes, but brimful of meaning when they chance to rest upon your face for a moment; beautiful hair, dark and glossy; plendid teeth; voice sweet and soft as an angel's;   CARRIE EMERSON.          149 a pure white brow, on which is written truth 'and candor; and," he added, softly, " a heart to match." ( Find me all these charms combined," said Irving, sadly, "and I promise you I will not be proof against them." "I met just such an one a few days before I left my own country," said Percy. "She was a stranger, but I became deeply interested in her;, and, chancing to fall in with one who had known her from childhood, I asked her history." "Well, what did it prove?" said Irving; " not that the face was an index of the mind, I 'll be sworn," "And why not?" "Because I met with just such an one some time ago," said Irving, bitterly, "and she proved to be a heartless coquette! I forswore the whole race. I would n't believe one of them." "But you may have been deceived," said Percy, glancing up at the handsome face of his companion. A dark scowl was gathering on the high, open brow; and a deep flush of red - it might be anger, it might be excitement - was seated upon his cheek. His voice, too, quivered as he spoke. "No, I was not deceived; I saw enough, with my own eyes, to convince me that I had not been misinformed: nay more; her own matchless power of boasting, under the cover of casual information, was enough to convince any one far less exacting than myself; and I left her to a more fortunate or more favored rival." "Did you not strive to clear up the mystery?" "No, indeed, I did not. If she likes him better than she does me, let her have him. He's welcome to her for all that I care." 13* e'7t-t 1 {     150       CARRIE EMERSON. "O, well," said Percy, "she could bear no comparison with my heroine. I'll tell you all about her," he said, growing suddenly more animated, and speaking more confidently, as if more acquainted. "I went to a place called Cliftonville, to visit the grave of one very dear to me. It was just before sunset - a lovely afternoon, and a sweet, retired spot. I had been there but a few moments, when the young lady I have described entered the church-yard. I moved off a few paces, and watched her movements. She began decorating the spot so sacred to me; and, unresistingly, I drew near. "I noticed a look of sorrow, that did not seem like that caused by death,- though her tears fell freely when she spoke of the young companion resting beneath the sod,-and I frankly told her so. She said but little; but that little in- terested me deeply. I left her, after an hour's converse, and went back to the village inn. There I made some inquiries, in an indifferent kind of way; and, as there were quite a number present, it led to a dissertation upon female merit. There were various opinions, as one after another came in for their share of patronage or scandal; and I was rather crest- fallen, after having drawn the public opinion to the start- ing-point, viz., the young lady I had cited, to hear her pronounced, almost unanimously, a heartless coquette, who, even then, was desperately flirting with one, while it was confidently believed she was solemnly engaged to another. I had been suffering, and was, even then, most intensely, from deception and treachery; and, strange to say, she, base as I had heard she was by nature, thus cruelly to deceive one who trusted in her, unravelled the mystery, and made clear some things hitherto inexplicable.   's I i         C A CARRIE EMERSON.        15 C :( "A few days afterwards, chance made me acquainted with one who had known her from chtildhood; and from him I learned a truth more in unison with a preconceived opinion, --that nothing so hateful could dwell in such a shrine; and again I fathomed a mystery;" "What was that?" "Why, that Edward Ashley," said Percy, grasping the hand of Irving, "was but' as a kind and affectionate friend and brother to one whose whole heart-and it was a treasure worth having - was given to another. Believe me, Carrie Em- erson is as true-hearted and noble as he who is now running away from her." Irving returned the fervent pressure of Percy's hand, and, with a glance that spoke volumes of gratitude, he escaped to his own room; and Percy, with a deeper shade of sadness, that spoke plainly of a grief beyond the power of love or friendship to heal, did the same. When they met at breakfast the next morning, the change was evident to all; and Percy, as if by right, while he prepared to become the companion of his ramble, bantered Irving upon his danger in living in such near proximity to one so beautiful and compassionate as Miss Everett. "Never fear for me, Hamilton; my lesson has been too dearly bought not to be proof against everything now." "But I thought you had forsworn the whole sex. You don't mean to say you will return, like a recreant knight, to  your first allegiance?" "Yes, I do," said Henry, laughing. "If she is as true- hearted as you say she is, she will be merciful, and forgive me. I only wish I could know who was the instigator of all the mischief."     152       CARRIE EMERSON. "O, never mind the mischief-makers, Irving! Believe me, they are beneath your notice. You ought to be thankful that you have it in your power to remedy the evil." And Percy gave him a sketch of his own sad history; and ended by ad- vising him to write without delay, and give, and ask, an ex- planation. ( Trust me," he said, smiling sadly, " you'll find scandal at the bottom of it." "Thank you," said Henry. "Another day shall not pass over my head, before I will have done all in my power to re- pair the wrong. God grant it may not be too late!" The letter was written, and forwarded upon its peace-mak- ing expedition; and Irving, relieved from a weight ofanxiety and misery that had shut up everv avenue of his heart in its own selfish consideration, began to notice his companion more closely. Day by day they joined in the same pursuits; and although, to all appearance, Percy was as healthy as ever, and inter- ested in all he saw or heard, yet, to the penetrating eye of friendship, there was a change. At first, they were never tired of exploring new places, and viewing diversified scenes; but, of late, their intervals of rest became more frequent; and while Henry would stroll around some lovely spot, Percy would throw himself down beneath the shade of a tree, and either sleep or dream away the time. Returning one day rather sooner than usual, he found Percy 'in a deep sleep; and, seating himself beside him, he watched his low breathing, and pale, care-worn face, with an interest almost painful. There was a bright flush upon either cheek, that might have been taken for health, but Henry knew bet- ter. It is only a few weeks, he thought, since he first came here, and what a fearful change has been wrought!   I             a A 1 I E :  8CARRIE EMERSON. ]53 :     When Percy opened his eyes, " large, black and lustrous," the haggard look was gone; and Henry felt why he had not noticed it before. "What makes you look at me so, Henry?"   (They had become dear and familiar friends, and all formality had been thrown aside.) "Because," said Henry, in a cheerful tone he was far from feeling, "I imagined, just now, you were looking ill; and I begin to think it not all imagination, either; you are not as well as you were." "No," said Percy; I have had strong symptoms, of late, of rapid decay; and I rejoice that it is so. What is there left for me to live for?" "Don't talk so despondingly, my dear fellow! Let us turn our faces homeward. The cool, bracing air of our own loved land will renovate you. And, as to not having anything to live for, it's all nonsense. You must bear up against it. A long and useful life is, I trust, in store for you." Percy shook his head. "If I could rest in the little church- yard at Cliftonville, beside Ellen, I might be tempted to make the effort; but it is hardly worth while. Our spirits will be reunited; what matter where the frail body moulders?" "O, Percy, don't talk so! Come, cheer up; and, at all events, we'll consult a physician. Things may seem worse than tiey really are." A physician was consulted; and, though he shook his head when he laid down the almost nerveless hand, and counted the low and fluttering pulse, he spoke confidently when he af- firmed there was no actual danger of dissolution at present. A change was necessary; but he would not recommend home. A sail up the Mediterranean would be much more beneficial.     154       CARRIE   EMERSON. Henry was anxious to stay until he could receive answers to his letters both to Edward and Carrie; but he conquered the selfish feeling, and commenced making the requisite prep- arations for an absence of perhaps some months; deter- mined to sacrifice every personal consideration, to protract or save the life of one who had lifted such a weight of sorrow from his own heart. Pcrcy's objections were overruled; and, to the care of one whom suffering had taught almost woman's gentleness, we leave him, to regain, if possible, his shattered health, -and broken spirits. "Though 't is all but a-drVam, at the best, And still, when happiest, soonest o'er- Yet, even in a dream, to be blest Is so sweet, that I 'll ask for no more." Carrie Emerson was sitting quietly beside her mother, lis. tening to Edward's account of a flying visit to Newport, when Willie came in, breathless with haste, his eyes sparkling with pleasure. "See what I have for you!" he said, throwing a letter, with a foreign post-stamp, into Carrie's lap. "And here's one for you, too, Ed. I thought you would n't care if I took it out for you." "Thank you, thank you, Willie! Hurra!" he exclaimed, tearing open the envelope, "'tis from Henry, hey! Why, Carrie! how foolish!"- glancing at her face, which was pale as death. Sfie gathered up her work, which had fallen upon the floor, in her surprise, and, with a trembling step, left the room.   CARRIE   EMERSON.        155 "Come, Edward," said her mother, looking after her a mo- ment anxiously, " read your letter; and then, pray tell me, if you are at liberty, what Henry says for himself." He ran his eye over the contents hastily. "Noble fellow!" he said, as he handed it to Mrs. Emerson; "is n't afraid to own it, when he finds himself in the wrong! And so the El- driches have been busy! By George! I thought so more than once." "And so have I," said Mrs. Emerson. "What an evil gossiping is! And yet, in a place like this, we can scarcely hope to be free from it. Where there is such a feeling of equality, as is always to be f6und in such retired places, there is too much unreserve. Besides, not being old residents, I suppose they take more liberty in criticizing us." "Just so. In the city whdre we were brought up, I might pay much more attention than I have to Carrie, and nothing would be thought of it; but here, there so many argus-eyed, scandal-loving busy-bodies, one can't breathe to suit them. And now, while I think of it, I 'll tell you what some of the gossips did for me, a while ago. "You know, at one time, I was rather partial to Miss Ade- laide Macy. Well, we were not positively engaged; but that did n't matter. I liked her well enough, and did n't care to be meddled with; and what does somebody do, but write her an anonymous letter,--and, as I heard, after a while, give her an exaggerated account of my attentions to Carrie; a second version of what Harry received. Well, just after that, I called, meaning to make one of their party to Saratoga; and she refused to see me. I was highly indignant, of course, and should never have troubled myself about them again; but     156       CA RRIE EMERSON. her father took such especial pains to traduce me, making me out a mere fop, incapable of transacting a little paltry busi- ness, that all the pride of my nature was up in arms. I im- mediately set about sifting the matter to the foundation and, if Willie found a first-rate specimen of backbiting, so did I. Not one, but three or four of them. I sent a lawyer's letter to one or two of them,- a kind of friendly warning, you know; and, if I hear any more, I shall give them up to the strong arm of the law." "And how did you manage with the Macys?" "O, I let them all slide! They belong to the same hateful species, if they are in high life. They may gild their fail- ing a little more smoothly, but the fault is in the foundation. It may be carefully screened, but it will be there still." "As long as you escaped heart-whole," said Mrs. Emerson, smiling, " it did n't matter." "No; but, then, you see, there was that fearful risk to run; and, for once, good came out of evil; and now, wholly cured of my penchant, I am once more in the matrimonial market, as the girls say; with a good share of sound experi- ence appended to my other sterling qualities "-drawing him- self up proudly, and surveying his handsome face in the glass. "But here comes my lady-love,"-- as Carrie, bright and smil- ing, though with the traces of tears upon her cheek, came into the room. "Come," he said, playfully turning her round, and sur- veying her, " what right have you to smile or weep, without asking me? You belong exclusively to me, I believe. Uni- versal gossip says so, at least." "O, Ed.! your joke came near ending very seriously. I hope you 'll drop it now."   CARRIE   EMERSON.        167 -   " "Well, that's cool, any way! After being your most de- voted all through, you want to set me adrift to stem the current alone. Here," he said, tossing her Henry's letter, I have, you see, his full permission to go on to the end of the chapter. Now, we'll have the. matter definitely arranged; yohr mother and Willie witnesses. Iold up your right hand, my man! I'm going to have the thing done properly. Now, there's not going to be the slightest change in any one thing. That would be giving the busy-bodies a decided advantage, which, for the benefit of mankind in general, and society in particular, would never answer. "I shall therefore stay by you in the self-same capacity I have hitherto sustained, spite of gossips or scandal, until Henry returns, and leads you to the altar; and then, as a groomsman, I shall of course play a conspicuous part. Would n't it be a capital joke, Willie, if by that time the minister became infected with the village mania, and put the hymeneal yoke round my neck, instead of Harry's.?" A merry laugh drowned Willie's reply, who scarcely began to comprehend the joke. "And after we get through," he said with mock gravity, "and you have settled down into quiet, humdrum, matronly life, suppose you show your gratitude by selecting a substitute for your adorable self." "Why wait until then, Ed.? I may conclude to live in single blessedness; or, if I should not, suppose you find one for yourself, and make oneceremony answer? Could n't we manage?  j   "Ha! ha! ha! by George!  she's afraid the parson will make a mistake! Pretty good one - is n't it, Willie? "     158       CARRIE EMERSON. "But I mean to have it all my own way; may n't I, Mrs. Emerson? I don't fancy double ceremonies. The gossips will say we did it to save expense. "Now, Carrie, get ready, and I 'll take you to sail. You too, Mrs. Emerson, and Willie. I must stir up the good people. I'm afraid they'll rest on their oars if I don't; and time is flitting - so let us away!    CHAPTER XIV.

TuPPER's PROVERnBIAL?oILsorHY. "How do you do, Mrs. Emerson? Good-morning, Carrie!" said Miss Louisa Eldrich, nothing daunted by the cool re- serve of both those ladies. "I called to see if I could induce you to join our sewing-circle." "I did not know there was one in the place," said Mrs. Emerson evasively. " , we 've just organized it! It is for the benefit of widows and orphans, and the poor generally." "I did not know we had any very destitute or helpless in the village." "Well, no more have we; but it is fashionable, and we don't want to be behind the times in everything, you know. The object we have in view, now, is not charity; rather benev- olence. I know you won't refuse when I tell you what it is. We want t present the minister a cloak, and a few. other articles of dress; his old one looks rather shabby, and he cannot afford another very well, I know." 3"-Iwi tih     160       CARRIE EMERSON. "You know more about his affairs than I do," said Mrs. Emerson dryly. "But allow me to ask why you do not go to work systematically, and get his salary raised? He could then have a choice, both in the disposal of his money, and in the texture and fashion of his garments." O, he has never complained of his salary, that I know of! It was to be a little delicate surprise, and a help at the same time." "Do you think it a very delicate way of telling a man you think he needs a new cloak, and is too poor to buy one?" O, you must n't regard it in th t light! It is the farthest thing in the world from the actual truth." "It is just what I should think if you sent the cloak to me," said Mrs. Emerson calmly. Miss Eldrich bit her lip, and her cheek became crimson. Determined not to be what she called brow-beaten; and more than that, determined to carry her point, and compel the as- sistance she had solicited, she returned to the charge. "Do you know, Mrs. Emerson, I think you very peculiar in your views? Every one I have called upon this morning has joined without demurring, scarcely asking a question." * I am quite willing you should think me peculiar, Louisa. I generally inquire into a subject before expressing my opinion. I need scarcely affirm I have done so in the present instance." "But you have the name of being very benevolent; there- fore I felt very confident of securing your assistance in my mission of love and charity." "Thank you for the compliment, Louisa. I suppose," she   CACARRIE EMERSON.               161 added archly, "I shall forfeit my right to it, if I decline the honor of having my name enrolled on your list." "But you will not decline, my dear Mrs. Emerson; I shall be so mortified. Why, I was so confident of your being a member, that I mentioned it freely, as a matter of course." "It will be better to consult me before you express your- self too confidently in my affairs. And now let me assure you of what I should have asserted before, if you had asked my opinion, that sewing-circles are my utter aver- sion. I should be sadly at a lost to display my benevolent propensities, if it depended upon tfiem." "May I ask what there is about them you particularly dis- like or disapprove?" "I will answer you briefly, Louisa. I never attended but one in my life; and I firmly resolved then never to attend another. I 'll venture to affirm, there was more scandal dis- seminated than anything else." "They must have been a queer set; the last ones to gather for a charitable purpose." "About on a par with the generality of people. One half their number, at least, professed religion. You must not go away now, Louisa, and charge me with being uncharitable or ungenerous; and I beg of you, above all, lot to accuse me of being an unbeliever in pure Christian faith and love, as manifested by the true disciple of Christ. I am not the smallest part of an atheist or infidel; but I despise hypoc- risy and deceit, and, as you see, am not afraid to advocate thee principles I cherish." The color deepened once more upon the cheek of the dis- comfited girl, and she turned toward Carrie, who, though     162       CARRIE ErMERso   N. she had taken no part in the conversation, had been an atten- tive listener. "( I don't suppose it would be of any use to ask you," she said; it would be natural for you to thinkl as your mother does; or are you independent enough to have an opinion of your own?" "My mother's experience is sufficient for me in this par- ticular instance; generally speaking our opinions coincide, and we are equally independent, I believe," she answered, coolly but politely. "Do call round and see us," said Miss Eldrich, rising to take her leave; " we shall think, by and by, you stay away as a slight. I'm sure I could n't tell when you were there last." "Thank you," said Mrs. Emerson; "I believe we have been rather remiss;" and, with a slight inclination of the head, she dismissed the visitor. We pass over her comments in her next half dozen calls; and, if agreeable, gentle reader, will adjourn to the sewing- circle. It was to meet at Mrs. Deacon White's; her house being selected as the most suitable one in many respects, and the minister's presence being solicited to give it sufficient eclat. Of course the arrangement was perfect. The work, in all its varieties, had been previously fitted by Mrs. White, and one or two who understood the utility of economizing time, and soon busy fingers were plying their needles. Social little groups had gathered, and social converse was brought into full play. The object of the present meeting was discussed more fully,   lI-            C a AnA-RRI E E MERSON.      163 the minister, after offering up a prayer for the special bless- ing of Heaven to rest upon their labors of love, had retired,- and the cost of the article in question, viz., the minister's cloak, was decided upon; an enumeration of hands requisite to perform the labor was next made. They fell short, and wits were set at work to find out who was best qualified to assist them. "Everybody seems to have work enough of their own," said Mrs. White. "It is autumn now, and I know just how it is. Fall dresses to make up; pickles, preserves; and, you know," she added, addressing Mrs. Benson, "everything, at such times, seems to come all at once." "Almost every one is here we care about having, I be- lieve," said Miss Stacy. "Except," said Cora Leavitt, "Mrs. Emerson and Carrie. I wonder if they have been invited." "I left it all to Louisa," said Mrs. White, "who was presi- dent of the society. Did you call there, my dear?" "I did, Mrs. White, and, as the saying is, I got my labor for my pains. I never heard a woman talk so ridiculously in all my life." "Why, do tell me, Louisa! I always thought, from what I heard, that she was very benevolent and charitable." "Charitable with a vengeance! I only wish you could have heard her. She denounced the whole thing as a scan- dalous affair; and said she hoped we would n't think of send- ing her a cloak, because she'd like the privilege of choosing one for herself." "Mercy '" interrupted a pale, delicate little woman. I hope she won't give herself any uneasiness; we can find ways     164       CARRIE EMERSON. enough for our money, if we 've any to spare, and people who would be grateful into the bargain." "Did n't she think the laborer was worthy of his hire?" "O, yes; she said we ought to raise his salary, for one thing. Now, I never heard that he had complained of his salary; have you?" "She told me, one day," said Miss Stacy, "that she thought a good many were wolves in sheep's clothing. I did n't ask her if she included brother Spaulding. I suppose she did, though." "O, no," said Cora; "she respects and esteems brother Spaulding highly, and would not take one jot from his merits ,either as a public or private character."   * "It was a sweeping assertion, nevertheless, Cora." "Well, she had Scripture for it, at any rate. She can quote Scripture with the most devoted of us," said the gentle girl, tears filling her eyes, which she bent down her head to conceal, ; "I don't believe in reading the Bible just to enable us to find fault, and pick other people's characters to pieces. Do you, Mrs. White?" "No indeed, Hattie; but it is done pretty often, I can tell you." "Another thing she said was," said Louisa, "that we had no very destitute people in the place., Now, if that were true, is it any reason why we should not extend our charities abroad? Just imagine the selfishness of never looking be- yond our own immediate circle for opportunities of exer- cising the kindly propensities God has implanted in our natures!"   !            cax MCARRIE EMERSON.       165 "True, Louisa. Never let such an influence induce you to act against your better nature. If Mrs. Emerson's conscience acquits her, of course I 've nothing to say; but for the life of me I cannot see how it can." I think," said Jenny Lee, looking up from her sewing, her large black eyes flashing as she spoke, and a deep flush of indignation burning on her cheek, "your understanding must have been sadly at fault, Louisa. I was at Mrs. Emer- son's at the very time you were there. I went to help make a gown and cloak for old Mrs. Ellis, which Mrs. Emerson bought at Boston; and, as she never does anything by halves, she wanted to give her the making also. I was in the next room at work, and heard, as I told you, every word that was said; and I am sure Mrs. Emerson was perfectly right, if she did not approve of sewing-circles, to denounce them as she did. She is only acting up H6 her principles of right and wrong. I honor her for it." "Do you think she shows a good principle, by allowing her daughter to flirt with every one that comes to her house, Jennie?" "I was not aware that she ever permitted any such thing, or that any such thing ever actually happened," said Jennie, indignantly. "I suppose not. They are thought very refined, perfect, and all that sort of thing, by some people. I wish I could see some of it, don't you, Cora?" "I like them very much," said Cora. "I am not much acquainted with Mrs. Emerson, but I met Carrie almost every day at Ellen Grant's, and I 'm sure I never thought her a flirt, or anything else a young lady should not be."     166       CARRIE EM ERSON. "Cora," said Mrs. White, "I must give you a little ad- vice. The less you associate with people who do not belong to your own denomination, or who, at least, are not professing Christians, the better. One is very apt to be influenced by false doctrines and worldly opinions." "Thank you kindly, Mrs. White, for your advice. I know, of course, it is well meant, but I cannot believe in such ex- clusive selfishness, or sectarian principles. I believe there is good in all denominations, if they live up to the doctrines they profess,- I mean all Christian sects; and I believe there is a great deal of pure Christian religion outside the pale of the church." Mrs. White shook her head. "You are young yet, Cora, and have had but little experience in fighting the good fight of faith. You must keep in the narrow path, if you would follow the Saviour closely through evil as well as good report." "That is just what I 'm trying to do," said Cora, earnestly. "I would not willingly, however, cast out one." "You are too liberal, my dear--too liberal altogether! You cannot expect to find all as good and true as they ap- pear to be." "God bless the liberal-minded ones!" said Jennie. "Amen!" said Cora. "It is -my opinion we shall find *many we did not expect to see, if we are happy enough to go to heaven; and miss some, perhaps, we did expect. May I ask a question, bMrs. White?" "( Certainly, my dear; you are always welcome to my ex- perience." "If you think we ought not to mingle with unprofessors,   CARRI   EEMERSON.        167 why are you so willing to avail yourself of their assistance in cases like this? You never let sectarianism influence you then, I believe." O, we should always encourage, both by precept and ex- ample! No knowing how much good we may do them by ad- mitting them freely to a share of our well-meant endeavors." "If they come," said Jennie, half audibly, "they are almost as good as we are. If they refuse, the more we can bring against them the better." "I declare," exclaimed Louisa Eldrich, "if there a'n't Mrs. Emerson and Carrie, just returning from a walk! They can stroll all over the woods, and talk any amount of senti- mental nonsense; but ask them to give an hour for the benefit of the widow and orphan, and they think it a waste of time. It 's the last time they 'll have the privilege of refusing me, any way." "Come, girls," said-Mrs. White, pleasantly, "if you talk so much I'm afraid you won't accomplish so much work. You remember what we have set apart the proceeds of this after- noon's labor for. Just think how much pleasure is in store for us. After we have earned the cloak there is the pleasure of presenting it. Whom shall we delegate? the most indus- trious, hey?" There was a stir among a portion, and all eyes bent industriously over their work. "It will be Jennie, I think," said Cora. "See, she has already accomplished hers, and is waiting for more." "I do not crave the privilege, I'm sure," said Jennie, " and, to tell the truth, I wish I were working for some other purpose. I have some doubts about its conferring the amount     168       CARRIE EMERSON. of pleasure you all seem to predict. Nay, I'm convinced it will not." There was a look of perfect astonishment depicted upon every face in the circle. "Pray enlighten us," said the pleasant voice of Mrs. White. If you have any false ideas of delicacy, or any reasonable objections, I think we can remove them very easily. It is not pleasant," she added, "to have even one jarring chord where there should be perfect harmony." "Jennie has been at Mrs. Emerson's lately; perhaps she  has imbibed her sentiments." "I have," said Jennie; "her objections brought home con- viction to my heart; and, when that is the case, I always think I am pretty near the truth." "And what," said a very haughty looking lady," can Mrs. Emerson bring against our benevolent plan? She shuts her- self up so completely in her pride and unsocial indifference, that she cannot be expected to feel any sympathy in such an object. She is constant in her attendance at church, with her family; punctual in the payment of her pew-rent; and if called upon for aid in any laudable purpose of real need, gives as liberally, I believe, as her circumstances will permit. But brother Spaulding might wear his old cloak to the end of time; and as long as it kept him warm, and he did n't com- plain, she would never trouble herself or dream of getting; him a new one." "Just so," exclaimed half a dozen voices. But let us hear Jennie's objections, that is, if she is char- itable, and willing to advance them for the public good." "You are welcome to them as far as I am concerned," said  i   CARRIE EMERSON.          169 Jennie pleasantly. "And as Mrs. Emerson lives up to what she professes, I suppose she has no objections. In the first place, then, if the minister's salary did not suffice to meet his expenses, he would not, I presume, be slow to make it man- ifest, knowing, as he does, we all love and reverence him as we ought; in scripture language, that we do think the labor- er worthy of his hire. Suppose he has a fancy for his old cloak - nay, a love, as for an old friend. Pride may whisper, it is out of fashion. He is independent- of pride. It suits him; he does not wish at present to throw it by. Perhaps he has a benevolent plan in view, by making his old cloak answer another winter; and it is a very good one for all intents and purposes. By wearing it he can gratify his be- nevolent intention, without a single sacrifice, except to pride, and that one voice only he will not listen to. "Perhaps he has made up his mind he will have an over- coat; he has the very article in his 'mind's eye. He has looked at, and inquired the price of several. One particularly suits him. He has not lived beyond his expenses; he can afford it very well. He has as good a right to a nice broad- cloth, as the wealthiest and most aristocratic of his auditors. Conscience acquits him of any attempt to rob his family by appropriating more than his share, or of outshining his neighbors, or setting a bad example, by displaying too much attention to the outward adorning.  Yes; he will pur- chase the overcoat, --it suits him, he needs it; or else, perhaps, he will wear the old one, oe wants to provide for a widowed mother, or some other near and dqar friend; and he will wrap himself in his old cloak, and enjoy the blessed privilege of giving, all the bptter fpr the sacrifice he has made." 15     170       CARRIE EMER SON. "Then, of course, a gift like ours would be ten times more valuable, Jennie."  "Not in my opinion. In the first place, as Mrs. Emerson told Louisa, you make him feel very uncomfortable, by letting  him know you had noticed his old cloak, and-thought it very ; shabby; and felt the necessity so strongly as to arouse all  your benevolent feelings, which, to be carried out, must make  him the subject of public comment. Some fall into your  plan at once; proud and happy to have it in their power to do the minister a favor, which is so universal as to lay him under obligations impossible to concentrate, because he can - never know how wide-spread they range. Others do not care a fig for the pleasure of giving, even to the minister. They want their time and their money   - more.  They'd like a new cloak themselves, but can't afford it. If the minister don't like his salary, let him go some- where else, and so on. Others refuse from motives of deli- cacy, not wishing to place him under any undue obligations; and they all feel at perfect liberty to comment as they please. Sarcasm from some, pity from others, derision and a whole host of unkindly feelings, have been brought into action, if  not agqnst him, against those among whom the benevolent plan originated. "You present the cloak. It is a good one; but, perhaps,  the coat was nicer. At any rate, it was what he wanted, and meant to have. Or, if he is satisfied, and can carry out his benevolent intention without sacrificing anything towards it, the gratuitous gift is robbed of the very charm that constituted  its all of blessedness. He is obliged to wear it, whether it suits him or not. If his honest, independent spirit rebels, the   CARRIE  EMERSON.         171 stern look of necessity, in his present position, that of servant of the people, or the church, -which you will, - crushes it. Gratitude must per force predominate, and every other feeling  must be stifled to give it play."  "( I declare, Jennie, you have a very queer way of making a thing appear just the reverse of what it was intended to be! If I had ever looked at it in such a light, I should never have had anything to do with it." "Pho!" said Harriet; (there are exceptions to every rule, and, I dare say, this is one of them; besides, it may be a temptation of the adversary, and I for one won't heed it." "If I were you, Jennie," said Mrs. White, "I would not let Mrs. Emerson exercise too great an influence over me. She must be a very worldly-minded woman, to let such sentiments get possession of her. You see how it shuts up the heart against kindly influences." "You mistake,. Mrs. White. Her heart is ever open to such. She has an uncommon perception for all the good and beautiful in nature, looking through nature up to nature's God. She is capable of much penetration where she is in- terested; and capable of almost any sacrifice where her duty is concerned." "I do not know her personally," said Mrs. Henderson, the haughty lady; " but, judging from hearsay, I should think her principles, if she have any fixed ones, sprang from an enthusiastic nature. 'If she feed it upon romance, her judgment leans more to the ideal than to the real. If she, for instance, made any deep researches into the subject of re- ligion, she would either become fanatical, or reject it entirely. There is no middle path for such as she."     172       CARRIE  EMERSON.               "You are much mistaken, Mrs. Henderson.   She has looked deeply into the subject; and in its purity and vitality is a firm believer; as far as I can judge, an idolater, instead : of a worshipper. But, strong in her independent sense of  right and wrong, she cherishes or rejects, according as her judgment actuates her."  4 She comes to church in the morning, for instance," said  Harriet, "and pays the deepest attention to the subject; and :i spends the whole afternoon walking in the woods, or sitting on ; the rocks watching the ocean. I call it profaning the Sab- bath. I suppose you have more charity, and perhaps think it only savoring of romance." "Neither one nor the other comes any way near the truth, , Hattie. I believe, as she does, that the heart's holiest feelings i are more deeply stirred in nature's own sanctuary; that there is no worship more pure than that which springs spon- tancouely from the heart, when the eye is revelling in a sense of almost overpowering beauty; when the car is listening to : the rill, or the ocean; to the soughing of the pine in its never-ceasing motion, or to the rustling of the aspen, when the wind's softest whisper makes it tremble; from the monot- onous hum of the smallest insect, to the gushing melody of the wild bird's song; from the little blue-eyed violet, to the  blushing rose, or perfume-laden fruit-blossom. Why was all this beauty gi en us, if not to lead us to a keener perception  of the power and goodness of Him who scattered it so pro- - fusely? How can we appreciate, if we do not mingle our  thoughts with it freely? And Mrs. Emerson says: 'What time more fitting than when the soul has been lifted above the cares of the world, and the perplexities of life, by an instru-  ment chosen and set apart for this especial purpose?'"  ai   CARRIE   EMERSON.        173 "It is a theory I 'm afraid would be dangerous, if it were more commonly practised.  It would naturally degenerate into frivolity. The eye, from being accustomed to such beauty, is apt to lose its first keen perceptions; the heart its inspiring sentiment; and apathy or satiety would creep in un- awares. Your worshipper of nature loses the ideality; and the reality reduces the nature to stoical indifference." "Well, Mrs. Henderson, our Bible says, 'by our fruits we shall be known.' If I have erred in judgment, it is because human nature is weak and liable to errors, and I am weak. I think, however, as far as I am capable, one half the church members, of every denomination, submit to be subjected to rules and regulations, which, in some way or other, are repug- nant to their own judgment and reason. They are, of course, all right and proper, and. were in strict accordance with the views of those who laid them down, for the observance of the sect they were intended for. It would never do for one to rebel, or presume to find fault. After all, it is only a slight difference of opinion, and so the yoke is put on, and worn with a smiling face; and then, if even one Mrs. Emerson stands aloof, and refuses to countenance what she feels is hypocrit- ical, she is unmercifully denounced as an infidel, or, at best, a very worldly-minded woman." W"Where did you learn all your sophistry, Jennie? It is a rare thing for a young lady to take such a sweeping range?" "O, I've listened to more than one prejudiced opinion of the lady in question; and I have taken particular pains to become acquainted with her ideas upon the subject." "They are very peculiar ones, Jennie, and I advise you not to let them come in too close contact with the reverence of 15      174      CARRIE EMERlSON. our own faith, which is, I trust, inherent in your nature. But  hero is brother Spaulding. Now, pray do be careful, and  don't drop a hint of what we are doing!"  "Well, ladies, I have been making some parochial calls, and I thought I would just look in and see how you were pro- gressing in your good work. I can see, from your looks, you  are all in earnest. Do any of you feel like making up a purse for a poor shipwrecked sailor, who wishes to get back to his own country, and has not the means?" No one seemed inclined to reply. "He is, in fact, a mere boy; got enamored of the sea, and ran away as cabin-boy. Next voyage he shipped before the :; mast, but, being very slender and delicately brought up, he was inadequate to perform his arduous duty, and consequently received rather harsh treatment. However, the vessel was wrecked, and he was thrown upon the shore, with only the clothes he had on. Nearly all the crew perished, and, as he  is a Spaniard, and can understand but very little of our language, I am afraid he 'll have a hard time of it." "Why don't he go to work?" said Mrs. Henderson, in her,  softest tone.  "Sure enough," chimed in Mrs. White. "Do you think we ought to encourage a set of lazy, vagakbond foreigners, brother?" "He is, as I said, sister, a mere boy. He has a home and friends near and dear to him, who must be suffering all the horrors of suspense. I thought, as long as he was penitent, and had a strong desire to return home, it would be but right to aid him in the endeavor."  "But we are so apt to be deceived!" said Hattie. "One   CARRIE EMERSON.          175 never knows how much to believe. I should n't wonder if the young scapegrace had parents in this country, who have money in the bank. We often hear of such things, and they generally have a good story at their tongues' end." "I shouldn't wonderi" said Mrs. Henderson. "Brother Spaulding's heart is so large, it would take in the whole hu- man family." Mr. S. swallowed the flattery, apparently, as he didn't answer it; and, taking advantage of the first pause, said: "Perhaps, as cold weather is near at hand, and we have no very destitute town's people, you might feel willing to give the proceeds of this afternoon's labor towards getting him a good warm overcoat." Perhaps he noticed the warm flush that mounted simultaneously to the cheeks of his busy audi- tors, and felt encouraged to go on. "It is a very beautiful thought, that, by our united efforts, we can so easily follow the injunctions of our blessed Saviour, 'clothe the naked, feed thd hungry.' Do you not feel it so?" O, yes!" responded some one of the leading members. "But, dear brother Spaulding," almost whispered Mrs. White, who, as president, felt herself called upon to be speaker, " we have already appropriated the proceeds of this afternoon's labor to a very praiseworthy object, and we could not possibly assist the sufferer in this way; at least not for some time to come." "Could you make up a purse to help defray his ex- penses? or do you know of any one who would be willing to assist in providing for his journey?" There was a pause. To use a quaint expression, you might have heard a pin drop; and then the haughty lady made an     176       CARRIE E IERSON. effort to change the subject. It did not succeed, however. Mr. Spaulding rose to go.                 - an "O, do stay to tea, brother Spaulding!"         : "Thank you, sister White; but I must hurry back to Mrs. Emerson's. I promised to take tea with them, and let them  :: know the result of my application." A brighter spot burned upon the cheeks of some of the ladies. He continued: "Mrs. Emerson very kindly offered to give the boy a home, and Carrie and Willie have volunteered to teach him all they can of our language; and Mr. Ashley has offered to  write to some agent of his father's, and, if possible, ascertain who the little fellow is. They were very unwilling I should apply for assistance for him; but I felt it a duty to try and lighten their burden. He is a bright, intelligent-looking boy; and I do not doubt but they will be repaid for their labor of love. Good-by, ladies! I wish you all possible success in  your charitable undertaking. I 'm sorry I cannot spend more time with you; but I promised Mrs. Emerson I would come early." It was a queer sensation that flitted from bosom to bosom as the door closed upon the devoted and single-minded pastor. '  There was a something bubbling up to the surface not very  ; congenial with the sentiment connected with the cloak. Mrs. White broke the portentous silence. "I 'm sorry," she said, very faintly, " that brother Spauld- . ing should allow himself to be on such intimate terms with such people. It does not look right, to say the very least of it. I'll warrant, that woman will strain every nerve to carry out her project; and then she'll have the name of being very  id   CARRIE   EMERSON.,        1" benevolent. And well she may, if that is the means she resorts to." "Yes; and she's the one," said Miss Eldrich, " who grudged an afternoon once a month; and got off by pretending she did n't approve of sewing-societies!" "Just the way of the world, Lu," said Mrs. Henderson. "Well, we must learn to bear such things patiently," said Mrs. Deacon White. " It's part of the yoke." "I shouldn't wonder," said a young lady, who had been unusually silent, s" if he were to fall in love with Miss Carrie. What a pity he did n't know how she flirts with Mr. Asley!" "More likely she's setting a trap for him," chimed in Lu. Eldrich. Annie Lee bit her lip, and her foot patted the floor nerv- ously, as she folded up her work. Cora, who mistrusted where the arrow rankled, whispered: "They ought to be ashamed of such ill-natured remarks. But you and I, who know better, can keep our own counsel. We know that brother Spaulding don't want Carrie Emerson; and you and I ksow, what very few seem to do, that, in spite of all they say to the contrary, she' is a first-rate girl, and never flirted a bit with Ed. Ashley, or any one else." "All I wish," said Annie, in the same low tone, " is that I. dared give Mr; Spaulding a hint or two of the plain truth. And O, how I do wish, they were not going to present him with a hateful cloak! But it wouldn't answer; so I must keep my peace. One thing,--if ever I am a minister's wife, and they do such a thing, I'11 send it back! " A merry laugh from Cora broke in upon the earnest bustle of leave-taking; and the little party went home, perfectly     178       CARRIE  EMERSON.  satisfied with themselves, their motives, and, above all, with  the benevolent society where scandal was thrown in gratuit- ously, to make the scale preponderate. If this chapter is too strange for fiction, gentle reader, have charity for its failings. I drew it from facts. 9   CHAPTER XV. All your attempts Shall fall on)me like brittle shafts on armor, That break hemselves; or like waves against a rock, That leave no sign of their ridiculous fury But foam and splinters. -MASSINGER. "I HAVE something good for you," said young Ashley, ad- dressing a handsome boy, some fifteen or sixteen years of age. "Why did you not tell us who you were, young bravado? Here is your father, only prevented by sickness from coming to claim the runaway; and your mother half fiightened out  of her wits, at the prospect of your crossing the ocean again, after your recent perilous escape. I have a great mind to take a trip out to Havana, myself, and deliver you up to your old governor." The black eyes of the boy sparkled with delight. He had made rapid progress in the language, and understood in a moment. "Do! do!" he-ejaculated. "Who is he, Edward?" said Mrs. Emersoi. "O, he is the son of Alvarez Bernardo, a Spanish gran- dee. The letter I wrote to my father's agent, giving a de-     1SO       CARRIE EMERSON.              I a i1  scription of your protege, fell into the very best hands. He - had very little trouble in finding his family. It was as Mr.  Marting expected; the boy. had been bewitched by some  naval romance, and had taken advantage of his father's tem- . porary absence, and absconded.  His mother was well-    ; nigh distracted; but, as no trace of him could be found, they  came to the conclusion he had been drowned. The news   if came so suddenly as nearly to upset his mother, who is very delicate; and, therefore, I think it expedient to get him home as soon as possible. One of father's vessels will sail day after to-morrow; and I think I'll go out in her. C me, fly round, Carrie; have Juan ready, and I'll bring woome the pret- tiest fan in Havana, and take especial pains to teach you how to flirt it after their most approved fashion. I can't help laughilng--can you? -to think of Juan Bernardo, son of a grandee, being an object of charity, too poor to attract the sympathies of the honorary members of the Cliftonville sew- ing-society! Ha! ha! Don't look at the boy as if he were going to be hanged! You are not going to part with him forever. He 'll come back again, I dare say." Juan smiled and nodded; and drew nearer the little group. "Some tilme, Willic, when the old Africa is bound there, I'll take you to see Juan; so get off that long face. Here, Mrs. Emerson, is a letter of thanks, and a very handsome remuneration for the trouble he has occasioned you. I think it so." "I can't take it, positively, Ed. I only did my duty by the boy."                         i- "You must take it, my dear friend, if only to prove that,  'casting your bread upon the waters, you will find it after    CARRIE  EMERSON.        181 many days.' If you-can't find any other way to dispose of it, put it out at interest, until some other one, more needy, is cast upon your synmpaihy. I have a similar one for our worthy pastor. It was through his intercession you took charge of the young imp." "But how came they to know so much about Juan, Ed.?" said the wondej'ing Willie. "O, somebody wrote all about it, Willie! But you need n't contemplate running away-you might not fall into such good hands as he did. I'm going now to deliver Mr. Spauld- ing his package, and make my arrangements; so, good-day." A few days more, and Edward and Juan were speeding across the ocean. There were many tears at parting; for Juan had gentle, winning ways, and had endeared himself to all; and the softly-modulated tones of his smoothly flowing language had a charm in it, as novel as it was pleasing. A short, prosperous voyage brought them to the destined port, and Edward proceeded to deliver up his charge. Al- most overwhelmed with kind attentions and heartfelt grati- tude, Edward accepted a pressing invitation to spend the time the vessel remained in port at the beautiful villa of Don Bernardo. Time passed swiftly and delightfully to the enthusiastic Edward. He loved novelty with all his soul; and there was a chlarm in everything that met his eye. The mother of Juan was of English descent; and her gentle, wining manners quite won his heart. But there was another and more powerful motive, that was weaving itself around him, which, as yet, he scarcely dared allow himself to think of. Juan had a sister, scarcely more than seventeen, but sur- 16     182       CARRIE EM ERSON. passingly beautiful; and he had watched her every look and  motion, until, at length, he became aware how dangerous it might become to his peace. Too high-minded and honorable to strive to win her affee- tions without the sanction and approbation of her parents;  not doubting, too, but their choice of a son-in-law had long been made, he grew anxious to get away from a place where his happiness was in danger of being wrecked; so, with a promptitude that ever characterized his movements, he went to work to shut out the beautiful vision while he believed him- self heart-whole. The whole family were strong in their objections. They would not hear of his leaving them until the vessel was all ready for sea. Edward stole a sidelong glance at Isabel. Her cheek was pale, and something like a tear trembled on her long lashes. A sudden rebound of the heart, and a ray of hope darted across his mind. The eyes of her father followed his. He smiled and nodded. "I see how it is," he said, in an under tone, as he grasped the hand of Edward. "My Isabel is worthy of a diadem; see that you deserve her." No more words were necessary. Ashley lingered a few days more, and then departed,- each heart satisfied with the share it held in trust. The interchange of regret and affec- tion was mutual with all. They understood and appreciated each other: it was enough. "How rejoiced I am," said the young man to himself,  "that there is no danger of any hateful meddling, as in the case of Carrie and Irving! I believe I would shoot the per-  son who would try to injure me in the opinion of Isabel, or "   CARRIE  EMERSON.         183 her parents; but there is no danger. I'll keep my secret; I 'll only give a description of her to Carrie. I wish she could see her. "I 've heard her talk of eyes like a gazelle, but I never saw a pair before. Shall I ever forget the first moment I saw her? I certainly thought it a vision; and when Juan said, "Come, Edward,- and speak to my sister,' I thought the little fellow had invoked an angel to bear him company. I dreaded to speak, lest she should vanish from my sight. And she will one day be mine! Will I not try to deserve her? There was no need of any such injunction. Thank God, my charac- ter is unimpeachable; no one can say aught against me. Mr. Marting knows me well." And thus Edward let his fancy range. Fear found no place in his bosom. Why should it? Strong in his own integrity, what on earth had he to fear? After he was gone, Isabella stole away to her chamber to give vent to her tears, and dream over her own vague hopes. Her father began to fear he had been too hasty, and to wonder if, blinded by esteem and gratitude, he had committed himself too fully -if he had\&mot permitted the young man to think he had won the fair Spanish flower too easily. Could it be he had overrat d his worth? Was he all he seemed? and, if he were, could he ever bring himself to part with her? And then he set his brain to work, to find out some one who knew the young man. All at once a bright idea flashed across his mind, and he sought the chamber of his lady to make it known to her. The amount of it was, he had been educated at West Point, and he had a friend there, of whom he had kept the     184       CARRIE EMERSON.              .  run; he was a resident of New York. He would write to him at once, and get him to make some inquiries. It would be better, before the young people became more interested inl each other. Yes, Colonel Macy, he knew, would be happy to  ,l oblige him.  "Colonel Macy, father!" said Juan, who happened to be  ; ,: present. "Why, Edward knows him! I often heard them   !  talking about the Macys."  Whether they were friends or not, was more than he could tell. It decided his father, however, and the letter was sent, ex- plaining motives and enjoining secrecy, as he would not like  to hurt the young lman's feelings by doubting his honor. Colonel SMacy was sitting at the breakfast-table, when the  servant brought him a letter. As he ran over the contents,  there was a mischievous sparkle in his eye, and his cheek  .' flushed with pleasure.  "Good chance to pay him off, don't you say so. Adde?"  passing the letter to her, which was written in good English. . She read it calmly to the end, folded and handed it back to i her father, who had not for a single moment taken his eyes ;i off her face. If he had dreaded to see a change, he was reassured. Not ^ the least receding of color, nor the slightest tremor was per.- : ceptible; and, when she spoke, her voice was calm and firm as  ever. "Really!" was all, however, she thought it necessary :  to say, as she arose from the table.  "True Macy," thought the colonel, as he gazed upon her. She had never appeared more stately or dignified. "If Ber-   CARRIE EMERSON.          185 nardo's bright-eyed jewel, as he calls her, could bear any comparison with mine, now, I should n't blame him for being so anxious. But were she black as the ace of spades, and wicked as Satan, Edward Ashley should never have her, if I could help it, for the slight he dared put upon my daughter. If Adde had been possessed of one jot less pride, now, it might have paled her fair cheek-yes, broken her heart. Such things have been. No thanks to him, curse him, that it was not so! But I 'll be revenged, and that right speedily! I 'll blight his prospects for him!" With a heart full of venom, he sat down to indite an answer which it might have puzzled a lawyer to explain. He did not bring anything against the character of Ashley; -he knew him well; he dared not do that'; -but every insin- uation told, guarded and smoothed over as it was. There was nothing, in his anxiety to serve his friend, left unsaid, which could possibly serve his purpose. Never diplomatist did his work more thoroughly- I might have said, overdid it. Had he said a very little less it might have had the effect in- tended; as it was, it set Bernardo to thinking. "He must take more than common interest in the affair to answer me so fully; and, although hedoes not say so in plain terms, it is evident he has no very high opinion of our young friend. ' One whom he can never admit to his house upon any consideration again.' Seems he has visited there. Well, my penetration must have been sadly at fault not to have discovered some of his very many blemishes; or else, Colonel Macy, you are most bitterly prejudiced. 'Personally ac- quainted;' there must be something behind the scenes, and I won't be swayed by it." 16*     186       CARRIE EMERSON. Wise decision! How miuch misery might be avoided if every one acted thus! Meantime, Edward, all unconscious that any one could or would be so base, gave himself up to dreams of future hap- piness ; counting the months that must elapse before he might  vi it his new-found friends again. He had written both to Isabel and her father, and there was a something so truth- ful, candid, and uprigiht, in the whole tenor of each letter, that it went directly to the heart, and disarmed it of any lurking distrust or prejudice which might have harbored there; and the answers, therefore, were as satisfactory as could have been desired. For once slander missed its mark, but it had opened a way for a fresh attack at somie future time, perhaps. EJ\arid had garnered up his happiness in his own heart; not from any selfish motive, but prudence whispered it would be best. He had drawn a picture of the beautiful girl, in love's own glowilng colors, that called forth the admiration of Carrie, and made Mrs. Emerson half guess hie secret. he had done it naturally, too, as a painter gives the finish-  ing touches to a beautiful landscape; first her home, then herself. After that, the name of Isabel never passed his lips. There was a change, which all remarked, however. A deep- seated sort of happiness, which, whileJt took froln his char- acter all its frivolity, did not rob it of one atom of its grace  and sparkling vivacity. He was not changed, only ilm- proved.  And Carrie Emerson, too, had undergone a similar change.  The light, fiolicsome girl, with her witchery and mischief-   CARRIE EMERSON.          187 loving merriment, had subsided into the gentle, affectionate, loving woman; assuming at nineteen all the grace and dig- nity of maturer years, yet losing none of the almost childish candor and unaffected simplicity of her earlier girlhood. If sorrow had wrought such a change, well for the young and trusting heart that had realized its need of strength, and had sought and found it at the only pure source. If she had suffered, it had passed on and left her, as it were, unscathed. And though there were plenty to find fault, she did not heed it; she had learned some bitter but useful lessons. Her mother was her truest friend, and she avoided intimacies. 'Henry was with his friend still, but letters came regularly, and there was perfect confidence between them. The con- fidence and friendship between Edward and herself were as firm and pure as ever; and she used to laughingly tell her mother that scandal had gone out of town. She really thought it had. But Mrs. Buncombe had returned, and had resumed her intimacy with the Eldriches,; a-nd as winter had set in, with the usual amount of balls, assemllies, and sleigh-ride parties, there was a prospect of quite a fermentation among the gossips. Carrie went as usual, and, as usual, Edward was at her side; and, had it not been that foreign-looking letters occa- sionally came, directed to the Emersons, they would have be- lieved Carrie and Edward affianced; and they might have been let alone. There was a lurking devil in one bosom, that was ever tempting to an outhreak; but cowardice--I wish I could call it conscience - prudently held the reins.     S1S       CAR I IE EMERSON. Tom Eldrich had got back, too, and he meant to set some- thing going. It was too deuced dull. To be sure there was  dancing, and riding, and visiting enough going on; but that was n't the thing. "Mrs. Buncomlbe wants you to wear your blue silk bar-  L rages, girls. She says they are the most becoming dresses you havc. She always admired them, and thinks she shall get herself one exactly like." "'Abominable!" exclaimed Mary; "she'll look like fury  in pale blue, such a complexion as hers! Why, she's as  black as a thunder-cloud!" "Hush, Molly! for Heaven's sake don't be so vulgar!" said Tom, drawincg down thecorners of his mouth, and trying to look shocked. I I 'm going to flatter her vanity till she gets one; 't will set you off to double advantage. The force of contrast is everything, you know." "But I shall hate mine ever after, Tom, and I 'll never wear it again." "Well, wear it this once, sis, just to please me. She 's so anlxious, I know she has some motive for it; and I 'll be even  with her let her do what she will. Here she is now; so I 'll leave you for the present. I 'm going to call on the Emer- sons. I shall give Carrie an invitation. Don't think she 'll  accept, do you?" "Invite that proud thing! I guess so. I would n't do it." I will! Ed. Ashley is out of town; he can't take her. Slie's too proud, I suppose, to go with the manager's invita-  tion; and if she won't go with me, she'll have to stay at  home. Besides, if she refuses me, and has forty invitations  [.   CARRIE  EMERSON.        189 afterwards, she 'd be obliged to refuse them, and it would suit me just as well." "Perhaps she 'll be pleased," said Lu.; "( I should n't won- der. Tom looks decidedly well since he has become fashiona- ble. His moustache and whiskers have added a good deal to his appearance." "I believe you, Loiza," said Mrs. Eldrich, rousing herself from a drowsy fit of absent-mindedness. "I should like to try my new scissors on his face; I 'd soon take off the addi- tional, and humanize him, at least. I felt quite proud of Tom before he went to California; but I declare he looks now like a great overgrown monkey!" "O, mother! how you talk! There is n't another in Clif- tonville can come up to him, any way." "True, Loiza; I don't think there is." "I wish, ma', you would leave off calling me Loiza. It's so coarse and vulgar that I hate it!" "Well, I can't pucker up my mouth to say Lu., and, what's more, I won't. If you get a few more new-fangied notions in your head, there 'll be no living with you. You 'll forget who you are, bimeby." "There, do pray stop! I want to ask Mrs. Buncombe how I 'd better dress my hair." "Curls, Lu.! O, do wear curls, they 're so becoming! I 'm going to a hair-dresser to have mine done; I can't curl it worth a cent, myself. I 'm going to the city, to-morrow, to have my dress fitted, and get some new ornaments." "What are you going to get?" said Mary, dreading lest she should say blue. "O, I can't tell. It won't be anything very costly,     190       CARRIE EMERSON. for I've had so many new dresses that Buncombe has got on  quite a long face about it. A little coaxing will set all right again, though. He's just fool enough, ha! ha! ha! What a good thing it is to know how to manage a husband! And here's Mr. Eldrich; you did n't make a very long call."  "Long enough to suit me and my purpose. I didn't mean Carrie should go to the ball, and I've hindered her most effectually." "How, pray, did you do it?" "O, I asked her in a manner that I knew would offend her, though she would n't dare to show it! Don't I look savage enough to scare any young lady? And then I urged her to tell me her reason for declining. She must have thought me deuced impertinent; but who cares? You see I know how such things are done. "She took it confounded coolly! Her confidence matched mine, any way. She listened to me about three minutes very quietly, thanked me very civilly for the intended honor, and, in the most self-possessed manner possible, bowed, and left  the room. There 's only one consolation, -I 've hindered her going .with any one else; and I know she loves dancing with all her heart." "Hindered her going?" said Lu. "You don't suppose she'd stay away for that?" "No, indeed," said Mrs. Buncombe. "But I wonder how she'll relish my being there; people that want to be ex- clusive and aristocratic shouldn't live in a village like this, where we're all pretty much on a level. Thank the Lord, we can dress as well as she can, and have a good right to the entertainment, as long as we can afford to pay for it."   CARRIE EMERSON.          191 Mary and Lu. winced. They were getting sick of her; the "( we" put them on a level with her. "I wonder if she won't be missed at the ball? She 's getting to be decidedly the belle of the village. What a queer fancy some people do have!" said Lu. "She's the handsomest girl in the place," said Tom; "there's no two ways about it; but too deuced proud. If she did n't feel herself so much above a fellow, I'd overlook the slight this time, and set it down to the account of co- quetry; but it's io go.  She was in sober, downright earnest; and every look said plainly, 'I despise you, Tom Eldrich!'" "I 'm so glad you 've found her out!" said Mrs. Buncombe. "I could have told you long ago, but it's so disagreeable to tattle! I found them all out long ago. Ask the girls if I did n't. I guess they wish they'd never seen me." Tom gave way to a short derisive laugh. (I heard to- day that they commiserated your ignorance so deeply, that they had an idea of delegating some proper person to teach you the proprieties of life; to open your eyes to a sense of your sinful nature, and show you what a fallen angel you are; a sort of home missionary. Capital idea, is n't it? They say Mrs. E. has once or twice wielded the pen in behalf of such; but her single hand is scarcely sufficient to stem the tide of ignorance. The under-current is pretty strong in some places. She thinks it a blot upon a peaceable commu- nity; and is philanthropic enough to wish to remedy or write the evil." "Her pen!" said Mrs. Buncombe, an angry flush mounting to her forehead. "Who, pray, cares for her pen?"     192       CARRIE EMERSON. "It' cuts like a two-edged sword, when she's in earnest, a Mrs. Buncombe. At any rate, I would n't like to provoke  her sarcasm, or bring down one of her denunciations on my  own head, even in the shape of poetry. I'm afraid of such  people." 1. ,   Pho! she don't call any names; of course you nor I  need n't take," said Mrs. B., laughing.           i"Needn't take, and don't take, I suppose you'd say were s two different things. I call them pretty nearly synonymous.  Besides, if you or I won't take our share, there are always  plenty of friends who know how to administer the dose,  ? whether we will or not."  Mrs. Banconbe was nonplussed. She wondered if Tom were in earnest. If he was, according to her theory, she  didn't mean to take. She took her leave, however, for a something in his manner warned her to beware. I hate that woman!" said Lu., as soon as she was out of i sight. "I do wish she 'd stay at home " So do I, Lu.; before she came into the neighborhood,  there was peace. We never had any hard feelings towards the Emersons, or any one else; and I don't know as we have now; but it is evident they shun us, and, if they had a good opportunity, no doubt would cut us altogether." Why don't you do as they did, tell her you want nothing to do with her?" "You was nettled enough, just now, because Carrie treated you so coolly, sir." "Well, I deserved it all. I have all along been influenced by you and Mrs. Buncombe, and she has served me right. It   CARRIE  EMERSON.        193 opened my eyes, however, and I mean to profit by the lesson. I advise you both to do the same; learn to bridle your tongues, girls." "You don't mean to accuse us of talking scandal, I hope!" c( Why, I think you always had a decided talent that way; and that woman has helped develop it wonderfully. But we won't quarrel. You be guided by me this once. I have something in view; I 'll tell you some other time. Promise me you'll wear your blue dresses, and I'll take you there with pleasure." "O, we mean to, to be sure!"And they went to work to alter the trimmings, and make them look as well as pos- sible. It was the last of a series of balls, and all the junior part of Cliftonville would be there. Tom's conscience smote him as he surveyed his sisters, both very pretty girls, when he thought of Carrie Emerson, kept at home, as he imagined, through the means of his insolent invitation; and he resolved to make amends by being more than usually polite when he met her again; -when, glancing his eye to the upper end of the room, he saw her, arrayed in spotless white, - a simple wreath of snow drops and myrtle resting upon the glossy braids of her beautiful hair,- the attraction of all eyes, promenading the hall with decidedly the handsomest young gentleman there, Ed. Ashley. Tom was confounded, utterly. '"Do you see that?"he whispered to his sisters. "' I begin to think her coquettish after all. "I should like really to know how she managed. I was told Ashley was in New York. And see there's Winsor,     194       CARRIE EMERSON. and Percy, and a lot more from the city! She won't lack partners to-night. When will wonders cease? And there's your friend, Mrs. Buncombe, trying to ingratiate herself into the Hadley set; but it won't go; they are of the Emer- son cast, and they'll keep her at a proper distance. Her coarse laugh betrays her, mince as she will. I shall leave you as soon as you are provided with partners. I'll follow her up with a vengeance to-night." "What has she got on, Lu.?" "I'm sure I don't know; nothing blue, at any rate; whatever it is, it looks flimsy and dowdy enough. And for pity's sake look at the jewelry! I don't wonder he wears a long face." "Borrowed, Lu., from a jeweler's shop.  She always does it. She told me that was where she got that gold watch for her husband. She 'll carry them all home, to-morrow, and laugh in her sleeve if she hears anything about extrava- gance." "You astonish me, Mary! She told me the watch was a present; she bought it with her own money." "Fact, Lu.; I had it from her own lips." "Strange how some folks will fib!" A few moments, and the Eldriches had joined the set. In one of the pauses, they chanced to be close behind Mrs. Buncombe. She was laughing merrily. "Do look at Helen Smith! How ridiculously her mother dresses her! Just look at the variety of colors! And see Anna Chace! she looks as demure as a kitten. Her dress is two inches too short; that's done to show her little foot. The Emerson   CARRIE EMERSON.          195 girl has got on an old white muslin. I suppose'they've been a whole month whitening it, to make it fit to be seen." "O, no!" said a young lady; " it was bought new for the occasion, I believe." "(No it was n't, Elvira; it's a splendid wrought India muslin; when she comes this way again you notice. It was a present from a friend somewhere across the sea." Mrs. Buncombe gave her head a toss. "I suppose you think the Eldriches had new dresses, too! I 'll tell you what, I should like to get up a subscription, and get them something to wear. This is the third time, actually, they 've worn those old blue barrages, this winter. I could hardly believe my own eyes, when I caught a glimpse of them to-night. I 'm actu- ally ashamed to own them as acquaintances, they look so shabby! Strange, people can't have some regard for the feelings of others, and, if they can't afford to dress decently, have sense enough to stay at home!" Elvira and Emily glanced down at their pretty pink silks, and a flush of mortification dyed their cheeks; they too had been guilty of the same crying sin. As they turned away to take their places in the dance, their tormentor smiled ma- liciously. They saw it, and wished themselves at home. Astonishment chained the tongues as well as feet of Mary and Lu. They looked at each other, but did not speak. Tom came up. "Why, what ails you, girls? You look as if you could n't help it." "Neither can we, I suppose," said Mary; " this is no time or place to show resentment." Tom left them, and in a few moments returned with Mrs.     196       CAR IIE EMERSON. Buncombe. "( Make room, girls," he said in his most insinu- ating manner. "I brought Mrs. B., out of sheer pity, you looked so grave. I suppose you are tired, hey? If you only had a spice of her spirit, now! Just tell them, Mrs. Bun- combe, what you told me about Elvira and Emily Jenkins, and Sam Perkins, do!" Mary looked disgusted, but she tried to hide it, and did her best to keep down the rebellious feeling. To tell the truth, she feared quite as much as she disliked her; and, as she expressed it to Lu., "would n't, for all the world, come under the lash of her tongue, though it was no slander." How do you like my dress, girls?" she said. Lu. turned away her head. Mary bridled. It was too good to throw away. She surveyed the questioner from head to foot, and then said, very calmlly: It don't suit my fan- cy, at all. I think my blue barrage ten times prettier, even if this is its third appearance. Nay, if there were another ball coming off, I'd wear it again, if it were only to please my friends, and provoke ill-natured remarks. Tom thinks we ought to draw people's talents out as we have opportuni- ty; it benefits society, by showing up detraction in its true light." "I "m sure, Mary, your dress looks sweetly. I should n't know but it was bran-new." "Indeed!" said Mary, "( do you really mean it?" "Really mean it? why, yes; did you ever hear me say what I did n't mean? But come, girls, what are you mop- ing in a corner for? - Come with me; I want to quiz the Em- erson. They say her dress is a splendid India muslin. I don't believe it, though. I dare say it's some old, tamboured   X         can9CARRIE EMERSON.        197 thing her mother had, years ago; or else her father bought it at auction." "I 'm not in the mood for quizzing," said Mary; " besides,  I 'm really tired." "Well; come, Eldrich, let's you and I go." "Agreed," said Tom, with a comic glance at his sisters; "provided you keep your discovery a secret, while I'm in your neighborhood. I 'm on my best behavior; and I can't allow my morals to be perverted by the force of bad ex- ample!" They moved off, and in a few moments were hovering in the vicinity of Carrie Emerson, who was chatting pleasantly with several young gentlemen. They listened a few moments, and Mrs. B. drew her companion away. "Big bugs!" she whispered. "You're afraid they'll take you for a humbug!"he returned, in the same low tone. ' "Nonsense! How provoking you are!" Another quadrille was forming, and one of the stranger gentlemen led Carrie forward. He drew back rather hastily, and said, half audibly: "I can't dance in such near proximity to that woman!" "Which one?" said Carrie. "The one just before us. I've seen her, frequently, in the street; and I simply don't like her looks. She came near annihilating you, just now, with a look. We 'll find another place," he said, moving away. Mrs..B. turned slightly round. The Eldriches were near enough to hear; and she comforted herself with a common remedy of hers, viz., "I don't take." But if she did n't, they 17*     198       CARRIE EMERSON. meant she should; for she heard Mary say to her partner, "We all know who that meant!" Th " big bugs," as she designated them, however, kept her in awe; for she did not venture into their neighborhood again. She watched them at a distance; saw they were very atten- tive to Carrie Emerson, and, apparently, old friends of Ed. Ashley; and her nature rebelled powerfully, when the convic- tion forced itself upon her mind, that merit, if not wealth, had raised them far above her malice. Carrie Emerson, too, had carried her point; and proved, openly, that there was a barrier between them impossible for her to overcome. And, though Mrs. Buncombe felt like tread- ing her under her feet, she likewise felt it was impossible for her to harm her.  For reasons best known to themselves, the Eldriches bore with her, and left it to time and Tom to show her up more fully. Perhaps Carrie's pleasure was as perfect as any one's there. She had escaped hearing any ill-natured remarks, and her account of the ball was a pleasant one; and next day, when the gentlemen called, there was no allusion, as she feared there would be, to the only disagreeable occurrence of the evening. But, if she carried away only pleasant feelings, it was more than all could say; and there was more than one strong reso- lution formed, to be carried out at a future time, and in more ways than one.

GRANT was reclining in a large, luxuriant rocking- chair, taking her siesta. Her maid sat a little way off, busied with her sewing, all ready to come forward, when her lady should arouse, to perform any little service requisite. The toilet table was covered with everything that could. possibly rejuvenate; and the ornaments were in keeping with the rich material and fashionable finish of the mourning hao- biliments. There were a few lines added to her face, seen in repose, which grief, no doubt, had added. Otherwise, Mrs. Grant was unchanged.     200      - CARRIE EMERSON. Elma, with a nervous, restless appearance, was moving about the spacious drawing-room. She was fashionably at- tired in mourning; but it did not suit her complexion; and she glanced up at a splendid mirror, surveyed herself a mo- ment, and, flinging herself into a rich cushioned chair, broke out, almost bitterly: "I wonder how long ma' thinks to keep me immured in this senseless manner; and how much longer I am to wear this hateful black! Strange she can't see for herself how unbe- coming it is. Everybody's going to Mrs. Saville's party; it's hard I must be deprived of everything. Besides, Ar- mand Carriere will be there; and I could see, by his looks, when they met on Broadway, the other day, he was perfectly fascinated with Adelaide Macy. She might wear black till the end of' time--nay, she might don a nun's attire, and it would be becoming. She's as stately as any Juno, no matter what attitude she chooses; and hers is a beauty that needs scarcely any embellishing. She has splendid eyes, too; and a way with them that is perfectly bewitching, when she chooses. I don't think she cares much to please Carriere; but her father does. Perhaps he thinks him a nobleman in disguise --and he may be, for aught I know; but it's anything but pleasant, after bringing him almost to a declaration, to lose him just by being shut up here; and only because it's the fashion. 'T is a detestable fashion, any way; and I won't submit to it any longer. Just as if we could n't regret An- gela's fate as deeply; and just as if it would make the least difference to her, in another existence, what we do here!" She rang the bell, and a pretty-looking girl made her ap- pearance. "Where's ma', Fanny?"   CARRIE EMERSON.          201 "In her chamber, Miss Elma." "Well, I want to go to a party, Thursday evening, and she is n't willing. I've made up my mind I will, however, in spite of anything; and I'm not going to wear this hateful black, either; so you be in readiness to fix one of my dresses. The white brocade will be most suitable, I suppose--and, remember, you're not to lisp a word of it to any one. I'm going out, now, to make a few purchases; and, if ma' comes to my room while I am gone, take care she does n't see any- thing to excite her suspicion." The girl left the room to obey her young mistress' orders; and the young lady, putting on her bonnet, and rich velvet mantilla, took her course up Broadway. She loitered along, in hopes of meeting (Jarriere. She was well enough aware that her dress did not become her; and that to make an im- pression she needed the sparkle and glitter of the ball-room, or fashionable assembly, to show her off. She bit her lip with vexation, as George Macy and another young gentleman made their appearance. They bowed, and passed on. "She's rather pretty," said Templeton. "Why, do you think so? She's rather diminutive, I think; and then her complexion is not very good." "The color of her dress is trying. Very few look well in black, you know." Just then, Carriere came up with them. "Who was the lady you bowed to, just now?"  "An old admirer of yours,- Miss Grant." Carriere laughed. "O, that was ages ago! I had not then seen that beautiful sister of yours!"  ! "Are you going to Mrs. Saville's party?"     202       CARRIE EM E   S N . I? yes indeed. Are you?" "Of course. Won't everybody be there?" "I saw Ned Saville to-day, and asked him if Miss Grant would be there. They are very intimate, you know; he said his mother had done her very best to have them attend, but Mrs. Grant was resolute. She's got some object in view. She 's too worldly-minded not to play her cards to the best advantage. If she had been in society lately, she would have brought you to a declaration before this time, Armand." "I rather think not," said the young man, gayly; "I won't have the mamma putting in one word. I can manage my own affairs, thanks be to the powers above." "My dear," said Mrs. Grant, in her softest tone, "' I have invited a few friends to spend the evening socially. I thought it would compensate for the disappointment I was obliged to subject you to." "How provoking, ma'! You always do something to annoy me. I promised to spend the evening with Emily West." "Well, dear, another evening will do just as well. I don't see how we can possibly get along without you. They'll waint to hear you play and sing; besides, I have a very agreeable surprise for you." "Another evening won't do as well! I 've set my mind upon going to-night, and I'm not going to be eternally disap- pointed. You're always getting up agreeable surprises; some of them," she muttered, "disagreeable enough, in all con- science!" "Elma," said Mrs. Grant, sternly, "do you think your conduct very becoming?"   CARRIE EMERS ON.         203 "Do you think, ma', I'm always going to be in leading- strings? I'm almost twenty! old enough to take care of my- self, I should think. Old enough to have a will of my own, at all events; and I vow!" she added, evidently getting an- gry, "I won't stay at home any longer. And, what is more, I won't wear black again; I'm tired to death of it." "Are you going to break through all rules, Elma? What will people say?" c"I don't care what they say. It is of no kind of use, ma'. I 'm not going to be kept at home as I have been; and I'm not going to stay at home this evening." "Not if I told you Julian Percy was in town, and that I had urged him to spend the evening here with his mother and sisters?" "No, not even for that! I don't care for Julian Percy, ma'; he's too handsome. He's too distant, too. I believe he hates women." I 've praised you to him till I believe he thinks you per- fection."  "'Well, I'm in no mood to personate perfection; so you must entertain him with another version. Plead a previous engagement, indisposition, sudden journey; plead anything that suits you best; but go I must!" "Will you return early, if I consent?" "I shall make no promises, and I shall go, whether you consent or not." And the young lady went to her room to dress. "I would have told her," she said, "where I was going; but I knew there would be a scene, and it would spoil all my enjoyment. I 'll take up with the first good offer I have. I 'm tired of living so. I do really think ma 's set-     204       CARRIE EMERSON. tling down into quiet life, and she expects me to do just like her. Angela has been dead almost a year; I wonder if she thinks we must mourn forever? "Keep the door locked, Fanny. I don't want her to find out before I go.  I don't care afterwards; I expect she will." "Did you take Miss Elma to Mrs. West's, James?" said Mrs. Grant to the coachman, after her company had gone. 'No, madam; I took her to Bleeker-street; to Mrs. Saville's." An angry look flashed over the lady's face, but she was too well guarded to betray it by words. "Very well," she said; and, seatinlg herself, she calrnly survey'cd the matter in her own' mind. Julian P'crcy had excused himself; perhaps he had been invited to Mrs. Saville's and preferred going there. It would all be well enough if his mother did n't hear of it. She had told them that her daughter was indisposed, and was obliged to keep her ropm. They had even proposed to visit the invalid, but she had put them off. Strange, Elma should run counter to her wishes, just then! She hoped another elopement was n't coming off; she should die if it was. Elma, meantime, was exerting all her powers of fascination, to keep Carriere beside her.  He was restless, and she watched his eyes as they followed Adelaide Macy. "Beautiful, is she not, Miss Elma?" "Too cold and reserved, I think, Mr. Carriere." ( Natural, I suppose; it sits too easy for affectation." "I'll tell you a secret," she half whispered, "if you'll   CARRIE EMERSON           205 promise not to tell. I'm very intimate with Adce; so, of course, I know it to be true." "4 Is it quite right to betray it?" he asked, coldly. (4 O, only to you! I would n't breathe it to a\ soul be- side; " and her eyes sought his face with an expression of per- fect simplicity and confidence. "Adde's breaking her heart about a young gentleman who used to be very attentive to her. Somebody set them at variance, and he left her without an explanation. Her father and brother pretend it was all presumption on Mr. Ashley's part; but I know better. She feels it more than they think; but she's proud as Lucifer, and hides it all." Do you believe in loving twice, Miss Elma?" "No, indeed; I think it very unnatural." "So do I; and if I find the beautiful Miss Adelaide in- consolable, I shall turn hermit." A light laugh was Elma's only answer; and she chose to receive it as a jest, but it left an unpleasant effect. Adelaide noticed the whispered conference, and mistrusted its import; so she deigned to come down from her edestal, and lend her witchery to fascinate Carriere. George was delighted, and, lest Elma should feel neglccted, he provided a substitute in the person of a young gentleman who had just returned from a voyage out south, and whose brain was teeming with sentimental nonsense, which some of the bright-eyed senoritas had inspired. He belonged to an aristocratic family, and there were times when his bump of self-esteem almost lifted the hat off his head. He was educated; at least he thought he was, having managed somehow to get through his freshman year; and, 18     206       CA RRIE EMERSON. thinking all work and no play not just the thing, had made the aforesaid voyage. He was soon expatiating upon the glories of a voyage across the Atlantic, and the ladies out south.  "And allow me to say, you look very much like a friend of mine, the Senorita Minnetta, aw, a very charming young  lady, aw." Did you stay long at Havana?" "No, I went to New Orleans, aw. Capital place; all but mosquitos, aw; big as horses, ha! ha! Put up at the St. Charles, aw; first-rate house; haven't had anything like it since I got back, aw." "You should have persuaded one of the cooks to come home with you," said Elma, much amused.  "Ar, ;aw, my dear Miss Grant! would n't be possible; the : fellows know better.": Disappointe  d and chagrined, Elma was a capital listener, until the young exquisite had exhausted his fund, and then he  strolled off to find another young lady who might become aw-struck by a repetition of his remarkable travels. The look of dissatisfaction or indifference, that gradually i overspread Elma's face, was not likely to strike the beholder very agreeably; and, as ill luck would have it, Julian Percy  stood at a little distance, apparently engaged in examining i- the engravings of a fashionable magazine, but leisurely and  intently studying the downcast look of one he had been taught to believe was more than usually interesting and fascinating.  She had been represented as very gentle and unassuming; but something like haughty scorn was now imaged on the finely chiselled lip and brow. She raised her eyes, and they \      j   CAARRIE EMEBRSON.         207 caught the scrutinizing glance of Percy. For a moment the thought of how she came there, and if he had been at her home, and learned anything that would bring against her the charge of duplicity, brought the crimson blush of shame to her cheek; and, before it had half subsided, she was listening to his cordial salutation; and interest whispered, "Let him think it was pleasure at his sudden appearance." He did not mention his mother and sister as being at her home, and Elma began to hope that, after all, it was a plan of her mother's to draw out her sentiments. She glanced at the animated features of Carriere, and then at Julian Percy, and thought the transfer would be decidedly advantageous. Her color deepened, and her eyes sparkled with unwonted brilliancy, as the dream of conquest unfolded itself; and she, too, exercised all her powers of fascination upon the unsus- pecting Percy. Tie was flattered. He thought he must have been strangely blinded, to think a shadow of anything like scorn could mar so fine a face, and he resolved to culti. vate her acquaintance; besides, he liked to see a woman show some spirit; he did n't fancy the insipidity of the very soft and gentle, tame and nerveless, hot-house exotic; beau- tiful enough, to be sure, to look at,-but powerless, and all too fragile for the sudden changes existence is liable to. "She looks," he thought, " as if she could nerve herself to meet fate almost sternly; suited either to storm or calm. I admire energy, either in man or woman." He attached himself to her for the remainder of the even- ing, and she played her cards well. When they parted, it was with mutual satisfaction.     208       CARRIE EMERSO N. Mrs. Grant had concluded to wink at her knowledge of where her daughter passed the evening; and, as Elinma had deter- mined to keep it a secret also, she could not, if she would, whisper her new-found hopes. BNext day Mr. Percy called. Mrs. Grant was alone in the parlor when he entered. He excused himself, very politely, on the plea of a previous en- gfagement; and Mrs. Grant, very adroitly brought in her daugllter's indisposition; she meant she should contribute to his mlother's pleasure, as she was very fond of music; and Elm: was, though she said it, no mean performer. Mr. Percy's countenance wore a very puzzled expression. Did I understand you that Miss Grant was indisposed last evening?" "Yes; so much so as to be obliged to keep her room." Just then the young lady made her appearance. The hate- ful black gave her decidedly a different look; and her mother had already done her part in robbing her of the charm he had woven around her. Mrs. Grant left the young couple alone; and Julian Percy, with a good deal of tact, spoke of her ap- pearance the previous evening. "I was afraid you were not in good health/' he said, "when I first came in." Elma was delighted with the interest he evinced, but she detested the idea of being taken for an invalid, and she hast- ened to do away the impression. "I never was sick a day in my life," she said, laughingly, "and I was never better than last evening. I recollect when you came in; I believe I was in a brown study. I had been told a friend of mine, Miss Macy, was inconsolable at the   CARRIEE EMERSON.-         209 desertion of one of her admirers. He was thought to be an acknowledged lover; and she was evidently trying to fasci- nate another, Mr. - Carriere. I could n't help shuddering at the thought of how much deception is carried on, under the mask of pleasure, in our very midst; and I suppose it had communicated itself to my countenance. It was no place to indulge in gloomy reveries, however, even though the frailties of another had called them forth." Julian bowed with an ill-disguised feeling of distrust in the philanthropy of his fair entertainer; and she set it down as the reflection of a kindred mind similarly imbued. She was disappointed to notice how different was his mood from the preceding evening. Were reason and love hold- ing an argument?  If so,--though what reason could possi- bly advance against her, she could n't inmagine,-would love come off victorious? She was glad when  he took his leave, and she sought her mother with a very self-satisfied air, determined that in this affair there should be no inter- ference. '"Now, my dear," said Mrs. Grant, " if you manage skil- fully, you will soon bring about a proposal. Itf'is a very excellent family, wealthy and aristocratic; it will be a great triumph over some   of the young ladies. We must have a little social party while they remain in -town. Show them all the attention possible, and you may leave off your mourning, as you are so averse to it. I think we -can manage it satis. factorily."  An angry scowl was on Elma's brow in an instant. "I do wish you'd leave me to manage my own affairs, ma'. I don't want a third person interesting themselves about me; 18*     210       CARRIE  EMERSON. and as to leaving off my mourning, I shall do as I please about that.' Mrs. Grant never used authority when she could possibly get along without it, and Elma's outhreak of temper was an unusual one. She had been early initiated into the mysteries of maIlluvring, and had become almost as skilful as her motler; but her recent failure with Armand Carri6re had provoked her, and the sleeping demon in her nature was aroused, and would be heard. She had heard Angela blamed for submitting so quietly to the will of another, although her vows at the altar had made it an imperative duty. Now, her own will was striving for the mastery, and she had been tauglht to look upon her sister's delinquency as a warning; so she lhad made up her mild to follow the impulse of her own will, be the coinsequence what it might. There was no arlgument with her between love and reason. She was too selfi h and worldly to understand the sentiment any more th:an her ill-ftted sister, with the difference in their dispositions, that where Angela was gentle and p1assive, as Garcia had said, "almost like a waxen doll," Elma was reso- lute ancd stubborn, though with tact and sophistry enough to hide it all. Of late, the quiet and seclusion of her life had exhausted her resources, and the monotony of her time was becoming irksome. Three or four of her young friends had secured husbands, where imagination had sometimes led her own high hopes, and she thought it was high time she brought some of her admlirers to a declaration; but, as to having her mother take a part in the thing, it was utterly out of the ques- tion.   CARRIE EMERSON.          2" Mrs. Grant waited patiently until the mood should change, and she could take the cue accordingly. But Elma was in no humor to let her own undefined plans be made manifest, and she hastened to turn her mother's thoughts into another channel. "Mr. Foster Etheredge comes here quite often of late. I wonder which he finds most congenial, my sentimental nonsense or your over-strained courtesy; the soul-inspiring strains of melody he listens to so attentively, or the quiet game of chess, which involves his all of interest? If it were not for the absurdity of the thing, I 'd enter the lists with you, ma', and see which could make the deepest impression upon the old bachelor's heart." "Why, Ellma! how ridiculously you do run on! I hope-- whatever you do with the young gents--you 'll respect our friend's age and bachelor habits." "Nonsense, ma'! Love is no respecter of persons, and I 'm half in love with Mr. Etheredge already. His old bachelor habits will be a capital offset to my unrivalled carelessness." "You are not so very careless, dear. You have only in- dulged in it more of late, and I feared it would grow upon you." "Thank you for wiping away the stain. I thought, from the amount of lecturing of late, I was past retrieving. I shall have more courage in my attack upon the affections of the burly alderman," she added, with a light laugh. "My dear Elina, I thought Julian Percy- " "Pho, nonsense, ma' I mean to make Julian Percy jeal- ous." "Perhaps you 'll lose him by so doing."     212       CARRIE EMERSON. "Plenty more left, ma'! Besides, if I do, there will be the bachelor of fifty. He 's worth something in the money mar- ket, if not in the matrimonial." "You talk like anything but a sensible young lady, Elma." "Now donut make me feel bad, ma'! If you do, I shall go to Mr. Etheredge for consolation. Mrs. Rich is a rival; did you know it?" looking archly in her mother's face. Irs. Rich! Why, Elma! what won't you say next?" "What do you think makes her happen in here so often when he comes?" ( Well, I never thought of it before; but she does happen to meet him here quite often." "Widows arc dangerous personages, mother mine! Now if Mrs. Rich were not an intimate friend and neighbor, I 'd most certainly offend her. As it is, I must put enmity be- tween them. I can't afford to have her for a rival." ( IIow foolish you talk, Ellna! and, allow me to say, I 'm not at all intimate with Mrs. Rich. To be sure I have in- vited her here pretty often of late, in order to make the time pass more agreeably to Mr. Etheredge; but the idea is pre- posterous that he should ever be led to fancy her." ( "And pray, why not, ma'? Is n't she unexceptionable? as the mammas say of the young gentlemen. She's a widow and he 's a bachelor, but what of that?" "She 's as homely as sin, Elma!" "And has Mr. Etheredge any pretensions to good looks, pray? His form is something like one of his old fourth proof  brandy casks I heard him boasting of the other day; and his complexion has caught the hue of the precious stuff within, I   CA RRIE E MERSON.         213 know. Sometimes I think it would be easy to flatter him into a proposal; it would save Mrs. Rich so much anxiety of mind, to know he was already appropriated!" "You needn't do anything so ridiculous, Elma; he'll never be so foolish as to think of her. If he does, leave it to me to enlighten him concerning her true character." "And, pray, what is her true character, ma'?" "She's an artful, designing woman," said iMrs. Grant, "if all she comes here for is to play the agreeable with my friend; and if I thought she'd be here this evening, I 'd man- age to have her think we were out of town." "You can't blame her, I'm sure, for trying to get a good husband." "She 's too young, for one thing. She can't be thirty, and he's all of fifty." ' Just about right, ma'. What shall you think if I hap- pen to be the bride-elect-an old man's darling, hey? I declare I 'll bewitch him if it's a possible thing; and then, if I get tired of him, 'I will make the widow Rich a present of his affections; unless," she said in a half-serious tone, "you have really any thoughts of a matrimonial project." "Absurd, Elma!" "I know it would be absurd for a widow of thirty to do such a thing; but, as you are so much nearer the old gentle- man's age, it seems well enough." "Mr. Etheredge is not old." "Neither are you, ma'." "But I have no intention of marrying again, Elma." "Who said you had, ma'? But I want Mr. Etheredge to have a wife. If you don't want to see me the bride, do select !I     214       CARRIE EMERSON. some one else. There 's Mary Evelyn, just the right age; too agreeable and sensible to be stigmatized as an old maid; she would make him a very excellent wife." '"I don't see what there is so very beautiful about her, I 'm sure. She 's as prim and dignified as a matron of sixty. She ought to marry a parson. I know, from her very looks, she expects perfection. But she may set her heart at rest; there's - no danger but she 'll live and die an old maid."  Let 's try and make a match between them," said Elma, mischievously. "I shall do no such thing. I respect our friend too much to impose upon him in any such way." "Well, there 's Mrs. Kendall; you always thought her per- fection. How will she do?" "I ncvec thought any such thing. If I chose, I could bring out imperfections enough to make you think her the re- verse of that. Don't you remember how hard she tried to keep her father away from here?" Elma laughed merrily. "That was because the venerable old gentleman was in danger of being caught in a matrimo- nial trap, and she wanted him to prepare for his exit from all transitory things. I'm glad she did put a veto on that project. I should invariably have called him grand- papa." Elma, I desire you to desist from such nonsense. It is too absurd." "Well, I will, ma'; but I am really anxious to get rid of Mr. Ethercdge before he becomes a fixture in the family, or my interest deepens into something more than disinterested friend- bhip, - mutual, instead of filial, affection. It may be me, in-   C ARRIE EMERSON.          215 stead of you, he is partial to; so, I give you fair warning, I am now going to bring all my allurements to bear upon him. If he is proof against them, why, there is more hope for some one else." "You had better take care of your own affairs, Elma. If you fancy one so much older than yourself, there's Mr. Mayo. How do you like him?" "I should like him to keep his distance. He's too pat- riotic. He would expect me to dabble in politics; and I've no taste for it." "Mr. Williston, then? He's a retired gentleman, with nothing to do but please a wife." "Mr. Williston! I should as soon think of marrying Boston Bank.  He never had a thought of anything but money in his life; - once how to get it; now how to keep it." "Mr. Owen?  He's no miser." "No, quite the reverse. If it were not that his senior brother heads the concern, he would have been at the foot of the ladder years ago."  "ow 's Mr. Winkley?"  "I'm afraid he would n't be able to wink at me as often as my follies would require." ( But, seriously, Elma, he's a-very gopd man. Every one seems to think highly of him. He gives a home to his mother and sisters." "That's as much as a man ought to do." "But he can afford it, my dear." "But I couldn't afford to have them in the same house with me; and, as I don't happen to want the gentleman, we won't, if you please, discuss him. And now I'm going to     216       CARRIE EMERSON. array myself for conquest, ma'. Had n't you better send me out of the way, or act a friendly part, and put the alderman on his guard?" Bec quiet, Ella, do!" said Mrs. Grant. "Your incessant rattle annoys me exceedingly." Elma took the hint, and left her mother to cogitate upon the new ideas she had brought to bear upon her brain. Mrs. Grant rang the bell. "If Mrs. Rich comes here this evening, Ann, I want you to give her to understand we are out of town for a few days. Be sure and attend the door- bell yourself, now; and, Ann, there's my blue-black gro de nap, you may take it and alter it over for yourself. I meant to give it to you before" The door closed upon the delighted Ann, who had never in her life been the possessor of a silk dress; and she entered with becoming spirit into a defence of her lady's char- acter; Betty, the cook, alleging that the dress ought to be hers by good rights. "Wasn't she always getting up the elegant little suppers when the pursy gentleman came to spend the evening? But that was just like Mrs. Grant's sel- fishness. She knew her like a book. She was trying to get round the old bachelor; but it was no use. She knew the cook and chamber-girl at Mr. Etheredge's; and they 'd heard Irs. Smythe, the housekeeper, say, ' that he would n't marry the best womlan that ever lived.'" "I know better," said Ann, getting angry. "If Mrs. Grant chose she'd make him offer himself before a week. I have n't lived here all this time for nothing." "I know she's a witch of a woman, as well as you do; but she need n't set her cap for him. He 's too wide awake   CARRIE EMERSON.          217 for her, any how. If she wants a hot supper got to-night, she 'll have to get you, or some other flat, to do it. I 'm sick, and I 'm going to bed." I won't," said Ann to herself. "I 'll tell Mr. Etheredge she 's out. I haven't lived here all this time for nothing." She did so; and Mr. Etheredge consoled himself by spending a very agreeable evening with Mrs. Rich, which gave Mrs. Grant ample time to review her speculation upon the third edition of matrimony,-calculating the chances of ultimate success, as they lay between manoeuvring and detraction. 19 *^ .     3Ws     CHAPTER XVII. 'T were idle to remember now, Had I the heart, my thwarted schemes.

"I '. inclined to think the bracelet will be mine, after all, Adde. Mr. Carriere is devoted in his attentions. Tell me, won't you, Adde? - has he proposed; and have you accepted?" I really don't value his attentions, Eva. I have not much faith in man's love. I thought, when we made the promise, I should really be married first. I may, as it is; but I have changed somewhat since then. I may, as well as another, you know!"   CARRIE EMERSON.          219 "Do you really think Edward was fickle, Adde; or that he would be guilty of anything so base as trifling with a young lady's affection, just for the sake of trifling?" "No, Eva. I will own to you that I have always cher- ished the hope that there was some mistake about those letters. I was too hasty. My conscience tells me I should have met him candidly, and sought an explanation; but pride triumphed, and it is too late now." "( Why too late, Adde?" "Because he has forgotten me, and has found another, mayhap more truthful. I always trifled with him. Pride ever forbade my being generous, and letting him see that his preference was reciprocated. It kept him always a prey to doubts and fears; which, to a nature like his, must have seemed anything but noble. I see it all now; and I cannot blame him." "And what will you do, dear Adde?" said the sympa- thizing girl. "Did your father know the true state of affairs?" "My father? No! he prides himself upon the strength of mind that can triumph so proudly over love! But he little dreams of the sacrifice it costs." "Then you have suffered, Adde, in spite of your gayety and what the world deems heartlessness?" ' "Is that what the world says, Eva?" said the proud girl, springing to her feet, and beginning to pace the room with hurried steps. There were tears glistening in her splendid eyes; and her lip quivered, as, with a powerful effort, she kept down an anguished sob. "But I must wear the mask, even though I die. You will not betray my secret, Eva?" pausing before the bowed face, over which tears were freely flowing.     220       CARRIE EMERSON. "I do not doubt you," she said quickly, catching the half- reproachful glance. "I must have faith in woman; and trust me, Eva, I have had no just reason to condemn it in man. My heart whispers, it was all folly. You do not think, Eva, I would stoop to coquetry?" O, no, no, Adde! But now?" "And, now, pride must nerve me to bear what follows. I will confide in you, Eva. My father wishes me to marry Armand Carriere.  I do not care a straw for him. I never should have unbent, and listened to his warm-hearted flattery, had it not been to pique that deceitful Elma Grant. I knew, from her look, she was telling him a pitiful story about my woman's love and constancy, which all the time she only imagined. How could she know aught, when I have schooled myself to deceive even my keen-sighted father? And, then, pride came to my assistance, and resentment too, though I blush to own it. And now they think I love another; and, to carry out the deception, I must wed him, and, thus seal my own doom. What matter? Don't try to dissuade me, Eva! Edward has found another, better suited to his open, generous character, to supply my place. He never read my heart. He must not read it now. I must wed-no matter whom it is with! I shall become a heartless woman of the world. The bracelet shall be a costly one. When you wear it, Eva, think at what a price I have purchased the right 'to be congrat- ulated as a happy bride!" ( O, Adde! I shall want to hide it where it may seldom bringo to mind such a sacrifice. I cannot bear to think it possible. Do you believe in destiny?" she added in a low voice. (Yes, Eva! I believe in destiny; and mine is a stern   CARRIE EMERSON.          221 one; but I will bear it nobly. 'Tis the last time a tear shall stain my cheek. I shall become stern, and cold, and hard. I shall be gay, volatile, and reckless. I shall become an adept at deception. I shall shake off the fetters that might enthrall, if I listened to the pleading of the soul. I shall prove to you, Eva, to whom I am now so recklessly un- burthening myself, that woman's pride may crush with a high hand every softer feeling of her nature; perhaps outlive every generous sentiment." Eva shuddered as she thought how frail a thing was hap- piness, shattered thus at a single blow. e  With a promise of Eva to be bridesmaid, and another that the subject should never be alluded to again, the young girls parted. Eva went home, and shut herself up in her own room, to ponder over what she had heard, and to indulge freely in the sympathy and regret it had called forth. And Adelaide, with an unfaltering step, and the warm glow stolen to counterfeit happiness, went to the drawing-room, where a few friends were assembled, there to receive with a sweet smile the congratulations offered by the chosen ones, to whom Col. Macy had made known the important fact that Armand Carriere had proposed, and been accepted. Perhaps not one amid the group would have believed it possible for man or woman to wear such an untroubled look, unless the heart were at peace with itself; so little can we judge from appearances! "O, little can we judge the heart By outward seeming ever; There 's many a little earth-born link Too strong for death to sever." 19*     222       CARRIE EMERSON. They gave her smile for smile, fulsome flattery, and advice that fell unheeded on the ear; little dreaming that the young and trusting heart had shut itself up alike from sympathy, affection, or hope. A few young friends were spending the evening with Elma Grant. One of them had been at Colonel Macy's the even- ing before, and the betrothal occupied no small portion of the conversation. One or two present had half suspected Elma's preference, and, out of sympathy, of course, they descanted pretty freely on the merits and demerits of both gentleman and lady. "She likes Ashley, I know she does," said Elma, bitterly; "but he was too good for her. Carriere is just about shallow enough to be taken in. He 's of foreign extraction, too; that goes a great way with some people." "She thought you liked him, Elma, else she never would have taken the trouble to captivate him; depend upon that." "I like him! Why, I think the man is almost a fool! I don't believe he knows whether he has a mind or not; and, as to that, I think they're pretty well matched; she's just about as fickle as the wind. It's a queer family, take them all together. I never liked to have much to say to them. So scornful, too! Why, sometimes you'd imagine the pompous old colonel was the Great Mogul; and, as to Ad., Queen Vic- toria never assumed half so many airs! All I hope is, he 'll carry. her out of the country; her room will be much better than her company." "I wonder if they are really as wealthy as they are sup- posed to be; or if (Carriere is not wanted to prop up a fall- ing fortune?"   CARRIE EMERSON.          223 ( Wealthy! I suppose, like a good many others, they manage to keep their heads above water. I dare say, if their honest debts were paid, they 'd have to come down a little. You must n't believe all are millionaires who give themselves the name." "I suppose they 'll be married in church," said Elma, after a pause. "I would like to be near enough to scan her coun- tenance. I shall never believe she marries him for love." It is useless to repeat all the heedless tittle-tattle of a few, who had, undoubtedly, picked up their sentiments in a school of scandal. Enough that Adelaide Macy received a full share at their hands; and, had she listened to it, might have gleaned enough to satisfy one more sensitive, that, whatever the world thought of her, her heart's secret was safe, except as far as conjecture was concerned; The evening passed cheerily away, in spite of the ill-natured remarks; which, as they were spoken partly in jest, partly in the way of conver- sation, had only added to the pleasure. After they were gone, Elma sought her mother in the back parlor, where she found Mr. Etheredge discussing the merits of a plump partridge, and listening with evident pleasure to the soft, insinuating nothings of Mrs. Grant. It was a wicked mood that prompted her to break in upon their social enjoyment, and, with almost childish perverseness, interpose a jarring chord. She was gay, too; and her merry laugh and light raillery were at variance with her mother's smooth and studied senti- ment. After a while, she succeeded in gaining his almost exclusive attention.     224       CARRIE EMERSON. Mrs. Grant fidgeted. "Really, Elma, your spirits are inexhaustible; what won't you say next?" "Don't be afraid, mother mine. I shall not forget any of the proprieties; but I heard something to-night that has pleased me exceedingly. My friend, Ad. Macy, is going to be married. I'm so happy! I thought to be sure Ed. Ash- ley had broken her heart." "( Iiss Adde don't believe in broken hearts, I think. I dined there a few days since, and heard her brother telling her a sad story of desertion and death; but she laughed the idea to scorn. She says 't is folly all, and that a woman of proper spirit will trample all such nonsense under her feet." O, she's heartless, Mr. Etheredge! I hope you don't believe the sentiment she advocates true, by any means. Because she never happened to love ardently, is no reason that there is no such thing." "She is a very lovely girl, Miss Elma; a little too re- served and haughty, perhaps; but we can easily excuse that." "Some folks have a queer taste," said Elma; "hers, for instance, in selecting Carriere from among a crowd of admir- ers. Just tell me what recommends him?"    i (I do not know him personally, but think his manners very prepossessing. Depend upon it, he has sterling qualities, or Colonel Macy would never have given his consent." "Perhaps, after she is married," said Mrs. Grant, "Mrs. Rich may succeed in getting round the colonel. She has tried hard enough; but the patient waiter is no loser; she may have him yet." Elma's light laugh chimed in: "Dear mamma, how blind you must be! Why, Mrs. Rich's speculations are all in   CARRIE  EMERSON.         225 another quarter. Who would take up with a widower; when there was a bachelor in the market?"And she looked so innocently free from personality, that Mr. Etheredge was obliged to get over it the best way he could. "Seems to me she is somewhat in a hurry. It is scarcely two years since her husband diedj and then she took it so hard! Why, I shall never forget how woe-begone she looked; and now,-just to think of it! She's a pretty good manager; so take care Mr. Etheredge! Widows of a certain age are very persevering, and can sometimes make themselves pass for more than their actual worth. Very agreeable and very charming; you understand. But I dare say your eyes are open by this time." "I really do not understand you, Mrs. Grant. I have only met the lady a few times at your house, with one excep- tion, and that was a few evenings ago. I called here, and found that you were not at home, and I availed myself of a previous invitation, and spent the evening at her house. I met some very pleasant people there, and enjoyed myself so much, that I shall be induced to repeat the visit very soon." "You called here, and did not find me at home,!" ex- claimed Mrs. Grant. "There must be some mistake. I have n't been out of an evening for a long time.'; "So the servant informed me," said Mr. Etheredge, very leisurely. " It made no difference, however; I amnsuch a fre- quent visitor here, you ought to be glad to get rid of me occa- sionally; don't you think so, Miss Elma?" "  Certainly! You can't imagine that the young ladies are setting their caps for you, whatever the elder ones may do. I have a great mind to though, just to see if I could make an     22G       CARRIE EMERSON. impression upon the heart that has withstood the united charms  " "Of both mother and daughter," interrupted Mr. Ether- edge; " positively, if I were called upon to choose, I should be at a loss." Elma's gay laugh covered her mother's very becoming con- fusion, and she turned to the piano, and, running her fingers over the keys, sang "L The time I 've lost in wooing." "( Is that a hit for me?" said Mr. Etheredge. "I 'm sure I don't know whether it applies most to bachelors or widows." "Ask ma'," said the mischievous girl, who had imbibed a good share of her mother's love of match-making. ( "You are too bad, Elma," said Mrs. Grant. "I never knew you so unpardonably rude before. I don't know what I shall do with you." "Send me to bed, as they do all the naughty children. Good-night!" she added, making a school-girl curtsey; "I 'll be a better girl to-morrow;". and she was off in an instant. There was an awkward pause, during which Mr. Ether- edge discovered that it was growing late, and took an abrupt leave. lIe had made two or three other very useful discover- ies in the course of the evening, and, like a wise man, he determined to avoid manoeuvring, match-making, and scan- dal, as much as possible; and, as the first step towards it, he would be chary of his visits at Mrs. Grant's. Mrs. Rich, somehow, had to bear the blame; but, as she never knew a word about it, and being perfectly innocent- even if she were a widow-of any premeditated attempt upon the heart of Mr. Etheredge, she was in the end no loser. She sometimes wondered at the sudden coolness of Mrs. Grant;   CARRIE  EMERSON-.        227 but, as her circle of acquaintance was large, and, moreover, worthy, she did not feel it very much. Mr. Etheredge met her occasionally in company, and, becoming satisfied in his own mind that she had no design upon his heart or fortune, allowed his fancy to rove'unbiassed; and Mrs. Rich was very much surprised one morning at receiving ai offer of marriage, which Mr. Etheredge had urged in most energetic style for an old bachelor, who is generally supposed to know nothing about such things. Being in no actual need of a fortune, -having already a very large one solely at her own disposal, --and being in no hurry to part with the freedom she enjoyed, with a true, independent spirit, the lady refused the honor. And, whether because the disappointed heart craved sympathy, or from a benevolent wish to vindicate the character of the lady from a groundless charge, is not positively known; but Mr. Ether- edge made known his defeated hopes to Mrs. Grant, and assured her of his determination to remain an old bach. to the end of the chapter. As very soon after, Mrs. Grant changed her locality, Mr. Etheredge, it is to be hoped, enjoyed his resolution. Miss Elma was fast verging into a blue-stocking; and as they have played the part allotted them in these pages, I shall leave them to the pen of some other, who may, in future, have the benefit of their unrivalled powers in all that pertains to worldly wisdom.     CHAPTER XVIII. O, lasting is the sorrow of a deep and hidden wound, When with the cheerful morrow no healing balm is found! And easy 't is with words to hide the stricken spirit's yearning, And wear a look of icy pride, while the heart within is burning. E. F. ELLET. Alas! few know the wretchedness which clings Around a heart in which affection's springs Arc flowing deep, unanswered, all unsought, From hidden sources. A. P. DINNIES. A aLORIOUS day had dawned upon the assembled audience of a fashionable church in New York.   There was to be a wedding; and all eyes were turned in the direction whence the bridal party were expected to appear. Let us glance one moment upon the bride, ere she issues from her chamber.  It was but a few rods distant from the church. Never in all her life wore she a look of more se- renity. The costly robe of snowy satin, the sumptuous veil, the glittering diamonds, - all are in keeping with the studied self-possession of the favorite of fortune. Even the orange blossoms, that nestle so lovingly among her luxuriant tresses, repartake of the sentiment so evidently pervading her nature.   CARRIE  EMERSON.         229 Before her is a young and beautiful girl, attired with the same care and cost; but her blue eyes are downcast, and something like a tear trembles on the long lashes, as her com- panion clasps a magnificent diamond bracelet upon her arm. "Destiny!" was the only word she uttered, as, drawing the jewelled arm within her own, she descended to the parlor. A few moments more, and they stood before the altar. There was a suppressed murmur of admiration, which was spontaneous; and well there might be. Happiness was beam- ing from every eye. The bride looked as if happiness reigned supreme in her bosom. Colonel Macy looked proudly round upon the assembled congregation, as if he would challenge the world to produce a more harmonious scene. George's face was a reflection of his father's; and Armand's look of pride and pleasure eclipsed them all. As the ceremony proceeded, the flush upon the cheek of the fair bride deepened; and at the close she raised her eyes, and for a moment encountered the gaze of some strangers in an opposite pew. Instantly the bright color receded! Death never spread a deeper pallor over cheek and brow! Even her very lips blanched; and, with a vice-like grasp upon the jew- elled wrist of Eva, she sank down powerless. She was borne out of the church, and home directly; and, after she recovered, from what she insisted was the close air of a crowded church in such sultry weather, she was as impenetrable as ever. Eva was distressed. She knew it must be a powerful stroke that could so crush and bow that proud heart; and she was thankful when at length she was left alone with Adde. "Never heed it, Eva dear!" came in broken sentences from 20     230       CARRIE EMERSON. the pale lips of Adde. "It was so sudden, I was not pre- pared, -that was all." What was it, Adde? Tell me it was only a dream." "Would to God it were, Eva! Henceforth it will be so. No wonder he has forgotten me! O, what a vision of beauty! Did you not see her, Eva?" ( See whom, Adde? I believe you are dreaming." "A sweet face directly opposite to us. If you did not, it is beyond my powers of description. I never in my life saw half as much grace and beauty personified." "( Yes, I saw her, Adde; and, I believe, allowed her the full meed of justice. But what of her?" "Nothing of her, Eva. But did you notice the gentleman beside her?" "I did, Adde; and must say I thought him not very po- lite never to raise his head all through the ceremony. I did mean to have a glimpse at him, but you fainted; and I am sure I should never have thought of him again, had you not named him. But what of him?" said the wondering girl, who began to think the senses of Adelaide wandering. "He was Edward Ashley; and I am not as strong as I deemed myself. I tell you, Evangeline, this is destiny; but I'll brave it yet! Come," she said, after a brief space, rising calmly from the couch upon which she was reclining. "I have yielded this once to feelings that must and shall be quelled. One more struggle, and they would gain the mas- tery. O, what. a silly thing to be weeping on a bridal-day! Now, look at me!" and a rich rose tint played upon her cheek again, and a radiant smile fluttered over her beautiful face. "Do not I look as a happy bride should? Remember   CARRIE EMERSON.          231 the bracelet, Eva, - pledge of eternal secrecy! And don't pray look at me, particularly at dinner-time. You'll see how I'll brave it all." "O, Adde, don't speak of him!" "Don't speak of whom? Edward, to be sure . I shall praise the beautiful girl at his side, until I make Armand think me positively plain; and, I shall expatiate upon the? good taste of Edward Ashley (you see the name does not affect - me now), until I prove him a connoisseur." "But, Adde, such efforts must weaken."  "Nonsense, darling! Such efforts tend to strengthen. You'll see how bright my eyes will gleam, and what a warm glow will aid my eloquence. And, Eva, while I am gone on the bridal tour, you'll please keep in your mind's eye a stately step, and a proud beaming smile; too truthful, remember, for idle speculation; too calm and peaceful, for aught like bitter scorn; too devoted and tender, for the slightest whisper of indifference to rest upon the hymeneal shrine!" "And Armand, Adde!"         l "Armand, dearest, shall never awaken from his dream of happiness, as long as it depends upon me. Are you satisfied, Eva?" "I cannot say I am, Adde. Were it but a dream now, or were you what you will seem to be." "Amn I not? Yes, and more even than I seem. Better thus, Eva, than to have my high hopes in the one I wedded blasted. Trust me, such shipwreck is even more fatal than this. But let us dismiss the subject. The bride of a few hours should never' peculate upon her chances of happiness or misery. Let the hallucination remain as long as possible.  \     232       CARRIE EMERSON. There is too much at stake to dare the waking vision: my father, my brother, and he, too, whom I have sworn at the altar, (to love, honor, and obey.' Come, Eva; I am strong and resolute now. We'll never speak of this again. It is high treason, you know." An irrepressible shudder ran over the frame of Eva, as she listened to the eloquent tongue of Adde, as she spoke of the young lady in church. "And, father, did you notice Edward Ashley? That must have been Don Bernardo's beautiful daughter, his future bride." Yes, I suppose it was his daughter; but I can't imagine how she came to be with that scapegrace. I told her father just what I thought of him. I shouldn't have thought he would have permitted her to associate with him. I 'll find out to-morrow how she came to be alone in church with him." Adde did not once falter; and, as Eva took her leave of her, she whispered, "You see I'm very happy!" And as the affectionate girl touched her glowing cheek with her trembling lips, she half believed the truth of the assertion. Adde bade her father and brother adieu the next day, and, after watching the receding steamer, which would bear them in a few hours many miles on their journey, he bent his steps towards a fashionable hotel, to examine the register, and see if indeed it were Benardo's beautiful daughter Adde had seemed so pleased with. Yes, they were there; father, mother, and daughter. And the pompous colonel sent up his card, and wondered if he should be able to persuade his old friend that Ashley was a popinjay; not at all the one to be trusted with one so inno- cent and beautiful as the Senorita Isabella.   CARRIE  EMERSON.        233 There was no lack of cordiality, as the friend of his earlier days came forward to welcome and introduce him to his wife and daughter. The journey had been too much for the lady's strength, and she needed rest; which accounted for Isabel's being at church with Ashley. He had met them upon their arrival, and had accompanied the young lady to the nearest church. "Do you know anything about that young gent?" said the colonel stiffly. Did you get my letter?" "( I did," said the don. "You must know," he added with a glance of pride at his lovely child, "Mr. Ashley is my son- in-law elect. I am almost as proud of him as if he were my son in reality. I think you either was misinformed, or mis- understood him strangely." Colonel 3acy bit his lip with mortified disdain. "He may have changed somewhat; he probably has. It is some time since I had the honor of his acquaintance." More he dared not venture. He saw the incredulous smile of Bernardo, the deepening color of Isabel, and changed the conversation. There was an exchange of civilities, which each felt was superfluous; and the colonel took his leave, wondering if all the Spanish ladies were as beautiful and refined, and as cool, as those two. At dinner he communicated his success to George, and added, ("You see what a man gets for taking an interest in his friend's welfare. Isabel's eyes are blinded, and the silly little thing deserves her fate. But-how her father, a man acquainted with the world, and with human nature, or at least oughtto be, should be so deceived, surpasses my powers of pen- etration. He must be blinded, too, in his devoted love for his 20*     234       CARRIE EMERSON. daughter; he sees only through her fanciful vision. And Ashley must be uncommonly prepossessing, else Addc never would have shown any preference for him. What an escape it was! And she is so happy, and they are so devotedly at- tached to each other! It seems as if the business of life were accomplished." Happy colonel, never to dream of the by-play in the drama of life! It is useless to follow Adelaide upon her bridal tour, or to sc;la her more closely upon her return. Suffice it to say, she was true to her nature, never swerving for a single moment from the path pride prompted her to pursue. Enough that she fulfilled her own stern prophecy. She opened her doors to the gray world ; took her place in the foremost ranks of fash- ion ; crushed every sentiment that breathed of a higher aim; repelled every effort to awaken sympathy; and the world pro- nounced her, what she really was, a very charmingy woman. And, pray, whose business was it, if she were or were not happy? She fulfilled all the duties the world required of one in her position. The man who marries the devotee of fashion should be the last one to complain, if she do lack sentiment or soul. If he be not satisfied with superficial attainments, he is a very unreasonable being, and deserves to find her a shrew. Armnand Carricro was perfectly satisfied, however. The world pronounced her beautiful and accomplished, and he took her upon its credit. There arc many just such ones in the world dead while they live. They had a heart once, but it has become hackneyed and callous, and reckless. But it has a fitting mask, and what matter?   CARRIE EMERSON.          235 Besides, Armand was her counterpart in one sense. With her blighted affections he had no sympathy;- too well she guarded her heart's bitter secret; --in all else hers was a kindred spirit. As such, he would have sought hWr in another sphere. And such is life. Eva, the only one who had any knowledge of the true state of affairs, was not even warned. She went home, shed a few sorrowful tears, in the solitude of her chamber; tried to fath- om the mystery, which, labyrinthian like, defied her skill; and after, when gazing upon the smooth, even surface, forgot the quicksand and whirlpool, the sunken rock and barrier, and thoughlt, as others did, that Adde had her share of human happiness. And Eva was called upon to choose between   worth, genius, and whole-souled nobility, in the person of a young artist, rapidly rising in his ,profession, around whom love had thrown a beautiful halo; and one who, nurtured in the bosom of luxury, had fostered pride and selfishness until they had become part and parcel with himself, - who only needed a wife, as necessary to sit at the head of his table, play the agreeable to his friends, give him an heir to his name, and proud possessions, take her place in the ranks of fashion, and, when he chose to neglect her, bear it with a smiling face. Had he not raised her to his own most exalted self? What could a reasonable woman require more? There was no deception in his character. He prided him- sclf upon his personalities; all the world knew them. And Eva, the gentle, affectionate, sympathizing Eva, shut her eyes to all but the glitter of wealth, and the show of power, and     236       CARRIE  IEBMERSON. married him. There are strange freaks in nature; 'and this, I suppose, was one of them. In after years, if ever the yoke became too galling, she bent her tearful eyes upon the bracelet, and called it Destiny. ?   CHAPTER XIX. 'T was but for a moment, and yet in that time She crowded the impressions of many an hour; Her eye had a glow like the sun of her clime, Which waked every feeling at once into flower.

SWIFT. "WHO was the lady that fainted in church, -I   mean the bride?" said Isabel Bernardo. "How very sudden it was! I was really frightened." "She was Col. Macy's daughter," said Edward, in a   low tone. "Col. Macy! why, he called here this morning. I ought surely to have known him again; of course I saw him in church, but I was so intent upon watching the bride, I hardly noticed him. I wonder what made her faint so suddenly."     238       CARRIE EMERSON. "Do you know, Edward, the colonel does not have a very high opinion of your merits?" said her father. "If I had been governed by him, things would have come to a very different termination." "Has he dared say aught against me?" exclaimed Ed- ward, the hot blood rushing to his face. "No, not in direct terms; but he insinuated that he did not like you. It made no difference to me, however. I 'm not a man to be swayed by any one's opinion, especially when I find it prejudiced; so you need n't trouble yourself about it. I wish," he added, laughingi, "you had seen the southern light flashing fromn Bel's eyes; you would think you had rather a high spirit to cope with in perspective." "O, father, you are too bad! You think I was unsocial this morning; perhaps I was; I couldn't help it; but you need n't make Edward think I am so very passionate. I can curb my temper when I wish to." "Edward won't think any the less of you for being ready to speak in his defence! Conie here, Bel. Shall I tell her, Edward, what you have just been telling me?  Go and call your mother, child; - we can't transact any business with- out her.  But here she conies; so you just be quiet. And, in the first place, Bel, how do you like this part of the world?" The girl looked at her father, as if his mood were a strange one, and she could not comlprehend it. The don laughed heartily. "How mystified we are!" he said; " but come; we 'll enlighten you. Seriously, then, I think you've had a pretty good chance to see both the place and the people; are you not tired enough to go home?" r   CARRIE   M EMERSON N.      239 "Go home? why, father, we 're just got here!" "Just got here? Well, where in the name of common sense have n't we been? This is the last upon our list of visiting places, at all events." "But, father, you staid longer everywhere else." "O, we could stay here a week or two; but, if you were tired, we could go to-morrow! I thought I'd try you; but that's nothing to the pgrpose,--I wish to know how you would like to live here altogether." "I can hardly tell yet, dear father. Wait a little longer." "O, I can wait your pleasure, if Edward can! How is it, Edward? Never mind, dear," he added, '" silence gives con- sent; so we'll accept yours, seeing you've lost the use of your tongue. I promised Edward, if you liked the place and the people, and loved him well enough to leave your child- hood's home forever, you should tell him so to-day ; but, if you wish to postpone it to some future time, I will not urge you." Edward was bending over her.  She looked up throufgh her glistening tears, and her beautiful eyes rested confidingly upon his face, as she struggled a moment for utterance. "( I do not wish to postpone it, dearest father. Edward does not doubt me; he knows his happiness is dearer to me than aught else in life; that I would not willingly cause him a moment's doubt or uneasiness." Her father joined their hands, and blessed them fervently. Tears sparkled in the eyes of the Donna Maria, as she came forward and impressed a  kiss upon the fair young cheek of her child, and added her cordial sanction to their betrothment, which, though long before understood as a settled thing among themselves, had not been formally spoken of.     240       CARRIE EMERSON. Never did human countenance wear a holier, happier ex- pression than those two, in their truth and perfect confidence. There was nothing to conceal; each read the other's heart, and found nothing uncongenial. In a few moments the awk- ward, embarrassed feeling had passed away, and they spoke freely and feelingly of the future. Plans were laid, which might not be lightly overturned; promises which, made in good faith, must remain so inviolate. There was no danger that, when that young couple stood before the altar, they would not realize the full meaning of the solemn words that would unite them more closely; words scarcely necessary to strengthen the tie that bound them. A year! how long it seemed, and yet how quickly it would pass away! Two weeks of heartfelt felicity passed rapidly away, and then they parted; sadly, it is true, but hopefully, beyond ex. pression. A few days after, Edward was seated in the cheerful parlor of the Emnersons, listening with pleasure to all that had trans- spired in his brief absence. "Mr. Spaulding and Annie Lee are going to be married; and O, how the folks do talk!" said Carrie. "Talk? why, pray?" "Why, they say she 's too young, and too lively, and too dressy. You never heard anything like it." "Does Annie care; or does n't she hear it?" "O, she hears enough of it; but she's too right-minded to let it affect her in the least! They even go so far as to call her a coquette; say she has a smile and a pleasant word for every one. And so she has; but is n't it too bad to misconstrue   CARRIE  EMERSON.        241 them? You ought to hear Jennie Lee, her cousin, defend her. You know there's a good deal of sarcasm in her com- position; and she don't spare it, a bit." "And what do they say about us, Carrie?" "O, not much! I suppose we don't improve any, though." "Well, we do; only it hasn't got about much; for instance, we both have a large amount of happiness in store, in which another may not meddle. The time has gone by when village gossip can affect us, if ever it has. ]By and by, I shall astonish the good people with a vision of rare beauty; and then you'll see them wake up to a sense of my short comings, and like as not my southern bride will be told, in an anonymous letter, that she has wedded a scapegrace, or a fortune-hunter, or a something worse even than that. -But it will not matter; the shaft will fall harmless." "God grant that it may, Edward! You and I have had our share, I think." "O, I never cared for aught, only as it endangered you. There was a time when I feared the bond between us would be broken; but it has passed, and good has come out of evil. As to Annie Lee, she's a good girl; and all I hope is, that, after she's married, they 'll let her alone. As the minister's wife, though, perhaps she'll be entitled to a double portion. I'd like to be parson over this flock about a year, Carrie. You'd hear some spicy sermons. I 'd sift them pretty thor- oughly. Some of them wduld be for sending me off; but I woild n't go, until I had brought home conviction to some of the slanderers, any way." There was a hearty laugh at the idea of Edward Ashley officiating in the parson's desk; and Willie proposed his 21     242       CARRIE EMERSON. telling Mr. Spaulding that he would like to change places a little while. "By the way, Carrie, has Tom  Eldrich called here, lately?" "No, indeed; though, when we chance to meet in company, he treats me very politely. The girls, too, since they are not quite so intimate with Mrs. Buncombe, seem very different. Perhaps the lessons have been serviceable; I trust they have." "But what if all the rest of the gossips should reform? Would she follow the example, think you?" "Will the Ethiopian change his skin? Now, mother, do get off that long face! You know I'm speaking gospel truth; that woman is past all cure. She knows - she must know - that every one is disgusted with her; that the feeling of scorn predominates over every other sentiment; that every one in the place would be rejoiced if she left it; and yet she don't care a copper. I rather think it pleases her." "Hush, Carrie! I know she deserves it all, but people will think, if you indulge in such speeches, that you are infected with the same disorder." "I am only speaking the simple truth, mother. Ed. won't think me so. Did n't she come near doing a great deal of mischief?" "Truth is not to be spoken at all times; is it, Edward?" "No, Mrs. Emerson; but for the time to come I shall keep a bright look-out. Some people that I know of will have to step quite gingerly, else I shall hand them over to the strong arm of the law. I think it high time they learned that med- dling was anything but a virtue. Now go and answer Juan's   CARRIE EMERSON.         243 letter, Carrie, and I 'll enclose it with one of mine;" and Edward took his leave. On his way home, he was obliged to pass by the Bun- combes' residence. She burst out into one of her usual coarse laughs. "See, there goes Ashley again! I wish I could get hold of something against him; I 'd tell it pretty quick." "Do, Nabby, let him and every one else alone a while, just to see how it would seem," said her husband, kindly; "you only hurt yourself." "Don't call me Nabby; it's a hateful name." "I thought diminutives were all the rage." "Well, Nabby's a nickname, you fool! Would you allow it, Mary?" Mary had called to ,keep up an appearance of friendship; in her heart she hated and despised her. She had never for- given her since the night of the ball. "It is n't as bad as some nicknames." "I don't know of a homelier one, I 'm sure. I think Abby very pretty; but Nabby, horrible-perfectly awful!" Buncombe scowled. "I know what Mary means, Nab "-- he hastened to correct himself--"wife; they call you the backbiter round here. I think, as Mary does, it is ten times homelier than Nabby." "Well, Mary comes in for her share, at any rate; and I should like to know who first set it agoing. I hope they don't think I'm going to bear all the blame. There 's Mrs. Rand; what has n't she said about the Emersons?" "Whateve it was, she must have got it from you in the first place, lcause she is not at all acquainted with the     244       CA RRIE EMERSON. Emersons, and no one but yourself seems to have anything to say about them." "That's right; put it all on to my shoulders, as if I was  the only one that talked about people, or disliked them!"  Do you like your neighbors?"  "Yes; don't I? Except some who are proud, like the Enmcrsons, and the Hadlcys, and Bob Green's wife. I call her the bean-stalk; I can't think of anything mlore appropri- ate; can you, Mary? A great, tall, gawky-looking thing! she looks as if she came out of the woods. She's so black, too! Why, I'm a lily alongside of her! And then there's the  Maurices; just about silly enough with their mock gentility. They 've got a house of their own, and a little better furniture shall we have - and, mercy, there's no coming near them! Pshaw! my uncle Jake could buy and sell every one of them. I vow, I hate such proud upstarts! And there 's the Lees,-- heavens! they've been a whole year trying to get round Spaulding, and they 've made out at last. And what's he better than commlon folks? just tell me. For my part, I think myself as good as the minister; don't you, Mary?" "I behave as well. I like Mr. Spaulding first-rate; but I think he has shown a lack of sense in his choice of a wife. Ha! ha! a pretty minister's wife she'll make!" Mary for- got a previous resolution not to say a word there she did not wish repeated. "She 's a deuced pretty little thing," said Buncombe. "I think he showed exceeding good taste, now." "Well, but she 's not a suitable person, Mr. Buncombe." "And why not, pray? Shc may be very capable of filling   CA RRIE EMERSON.         245 such a station. She has a very excellent mother, who may have taught her perfection, for what we know." Again that diabolical laugh. "Your mother is perfection, according to your account; perhaps she thinks you didn't display very good taste." - "She does; and so do my sisters," said Buncombe, bit- terly, as he left the room. "Good!" shouted .Mrs. B. "Now, you see, Mary, when I want to get rid of him I always slur him. about hi-e4fks; it makes him horrid mad.  They hate and despise me, and that's all the way I can be revenged. Now you and I can have a good chat, Mary." "Thank you, Mrs. Buncombe," said Mary, coolly; "I 'm in something of a hurry; I promised mother I would n't be gone long." "You 're always in a hurry lately, Mary. It did n't use to be so. I hope nothing has been said to create hard feelings between us." "O dear, no! nothing at all." "Well, do tell me if Ed. Ashley isn't going to marry Caroline Emerson, after all." "I don't know, I'm sure. What put that into your head, pray?" "O, a number of things. They go to the city pretty often, lately, and I heard she was very busy-sewing, and that she had lots of new dresses. High time the poor thing had some- thing decent to wear; don't you say so? I called upon Allie Cameron the other day, to see if she knew anything about them; and, as far as I could find out, they despise her as much as they do me. Carrie's father goes there occasionally, 21* 1i     246       CARRIE EMERSON. and sometimes she questions him; and I have no doubt but Allic has told him every word I've said about his family. I mean to call again, soon. I like that Allie Cameron. She 's a girl after my own heart; can act the lady to perfection if she choose, but, like me, don't always think it worth the trouble." "Who is attentive to Miss Carmeron now? I heard that Mr. Gushing was highly incensed when he discovered that she wore another young gentleman's miniature round her neck, and his own in her pocket." "Good joke, wasn't it, Mary? They said enough about Cushing at the timie, but he did n't care; and if you want to know who is the favored one, now, you mustn't ask me. I never tell, tales. I think, however, there are half a dozen of them. Beaus are plenty as blackberries, Mary; and such girls as my friend Allie will have a good share, you may well believe. Sometimes I can't help wondering what all the gen- tlemen, married and single, can see in her, for she 's homely as I am," -and Mrs. Buncombe stole a glance at the glass.- "I confess I should be jealous if shemade as much of my husband as she does of Mr. Emerson." "Why, does she really make herself so ridiculous? I should think Mrs. Emerson would be very unhappy if she heard of it. I hope you don't mean to tell of it to any one else." "Pho! she would think it beneath her notice to trouble herself about such a thing at all. She has heard and seen enough, long ago; and once she had serious thoughts of acqluainting Allie's father with some discoveries she-had made; but, out of respect and sheer pity to him, she desisted."   CARRIE EMERSON.          247 "How do you know all this?" O, I knew it a long time ago, when I used to call there. And other people know it, too. If it was me, I 'd raise a breeze; but I like Allie, for all that. Every one has their faults you know, Mary; and I am so far from perfection my- self, that I can sympathize with Allie much better than with some others I could mention, -Carrie Emerson for instance. Who knows what trouble her flirting with Ed. Ashley may not make?  Stranger things than that have happened you know." "No danger of that," said Mary, who was determined to maintain a contrary opinion. "She 's too wide awake to give rumor anything serious to feed upon; and, however she may flirt with Ed. Ashley, I guess she's a good girl." "Good! the Lord deliver me from such goodness! She may throw dust in your' eyes, but she can't in mine. I've seen too much of the world, let me tell you." "Why, Mrs. Buncombe! you certainly would not dare in- sinuate that Carrie Emerson was not a good girl. What do you mean?" "I don't insinuate anything, Mary; but, between you and me, she's no better than she should be." "For pity's sake, what is the world coming to! Well, I always said her pride would have a fall." "Well, don't say anything about it, Mary. They would try, perhaps, to make us prove it; and you or I want nothing to do with such people."   ")  "I won't," said Mary; "biutyeuJen't think how it aston- ishes me. I 'll only tell Lu, though. And in a few moments Lu. was duly enlightened.     248       C A  I RE EMERSON. "Well, it won't do for us to say anything, but we won't notice her, after this, Lu.; and then, if folks won't take the hint, let them find her out, as we have. Time will show. Don't lisp a word before mother; she'll only make a fuss, and say we got it of our neighbor. She can't see only what's on the surface. And here 's Tom." "Tom, if you'll promise not to tell, I'll let you into a secret." "Tell away, Molly; I'll promise anything." "Well, I heard just now that Carrie Emerson wasn't a good girl." "Who told all that?" "O, I shan't tell! But I've got my eyes opened, and I never mean to notice her again." "Who told you, Mary?" "Did n't I say I should n't tell? It won't do; but then it's true, no doubt. Who would dare say such a thing, if it was n't true? I 'll bet she's going to be married, and in a hurry, too! Lucky to find any one fool enough to have her; but there, I always said Ed. would be sorry for his part. If he had staid away, and minded his own business, I dare say Henry Irving would have come back, after a while. But, no! he must keep round her. Serves him just right." "Do you believe he's going to make such a confounded fool of himself as to have her?" "Why not? After all, she is as good as he is, if she has gone astray. I dare say, he was the first to entice her; and I don't pity either of them." "But, how do you know they are going to be married?" "I don't know certain. How mighty dull you are! I   CARRIE EMERSON.          249 only supposed so. It would only be generous of him. I know she has been sewing a good deal, lately." "She may have done that for some one else. How do we know but that she does it to earn something?" "Pho! She's too plaguy lazy for that! I wonder how she makes out to do her own sewing, let alone any one's else." "Hurra!" shouted Tom. "I heard yesterday that Irving was in Havana, spending a few weeks, previous to coming to B. I'll write him a friendly letter, and tell him the news. I owe him as much as that for his confounded coolness when we were at California. It strikes me, if it had n't been for the information I gave him, he might have been taken in him- self. He loved her well enough, at one time, I know. But jealousy makes wretched work sometimes. He might have treated me decently, if he was disappointed." "Then he is really coming home,"' said Lu. "Yes; and I mean to try and get him to come down here, and make a visit. So, try and look your best; it would be a glorious triumph over the Emersons if you could catch him. He made a mint of money out West, and, no doubt, he has been adding to it since." "I shan't try to captivate him, Tom. I should hate to have her think I was willing to take up with her discarded lovers. A girl like her, too! If she were anything else, now!" "O, never mind that, Lu.! You won't find many such chances; so I advise you to do your best. Now, I was going up town to-night; but I won't - I 'll stay and write my let- ter. I'll prove to Henry that I don't forget my old friends, whatever others may do."     250       CARRIE  EMERSON. "Remember me to him," said Lu., softly. "' He was always a favorite of mine; though Caroline Emerson always tried to put me in the shade." "Well, she's getting paid for it now; so don't mind it. You know what they say -she 's no better than she should be!"   CHAPTER XX. Though human, thou didst not deceive me; Though woman, thou didst not forsake; Though loved, thou foreborest to grieve me; Though slandered, thou never couldst shake; Though trusted, thou didst not disclaim me; Though parted, it was not to fly; Though watchful, 't was not to defame me; Nor mute, that the world might belie. BYRON. THE bright eyes of Isabel Bernardo were slowly filling with tears, as they rested upon the face of a young gentleman, the guest of her father. He, in company with another, had brought letters of introduction from Edward Ashley. That was of itself enough to interest her in any one; and she longed to hear them speak of him, who, she doubted not, was a very dear friend, if not relative. But there was pity and sympathy in her gaze; for he who attracted it was evidently a sufferer. He sat near the open window; and the cool evening breeze, laden with perfume, lifted the dark curls from his marble fore- head, and fanned his cheek, where a small red spot was burn- ing; and the hand that lay upon the arm of the rich cushioned chair was almost nerveless. His friend, after arranging everything for his comfort, had     252       CARRIE EM ERSON. left the room, in company with her father, and Isabel was left alone with the invalid. The beautiful girl watched stealthily the variations of 'his countenance, as he sat gazing at the sky, where the last tinges of a gorgeous sunset were visible. The silence was almost painful; and she took up her guitar, and, touching it lightly, sang the vesper hymn. The sweet voice, so full of touching melody, and the gentle, unaf- fected manner, so free, and almost child-like, harmonized with the stranger's mood, and at once broke down the barrier, which apathy, and the feeling which would naturally present itself to a stranger and an invalid upon entering as an inmate the sacred sanctuary of another's home, had raised; and he addressed her as one whom he had long known. When the gentlemen returned to the parlor they were con- versing like old fiiends. The song and the music had gone home to his heart, and it seemed to have imparted strength, too; for lie entered into the general conversation with an earnestness that was somewhat at variance with his languid look. "I wish I had known of your coming," said Don Bernardo. "I would have written to Edward to meet you here." "I wish you had," said Irving,- for it was he,--" but I did not know it myself until a short time before I started. I had written him, some time before, apprizing him of my in- tention of trying to reach home as soon as possible" (glanc- ing at his friend), " and that I should come this way. And I received an answer immediately, enclosing letters to yourself, and entreating me to spend a few days here." "Suppose I write a few lines now, and invite him to come out? It would be very pleasant, all round."   CARRIE EMERSON.          253 Irving looked furtively at Hamilton, and shook his head. Percy smiled faintly. "I had but one wish, my dear sir; and that was, to reach home before I die. I am strong enough at present; I would not like to interfere with any pleasur- able arrangement." "You will be gaining strength by tarrying with us, I hope. My wife and daughter are both excellent nurses, and will do all in their power to help restore you." Donna Maria and Isabel came forward, and sweetly and cordially pressed the invitation. All objections were thus happily overruled, and the letter was written. The next two or three weeks were spent in exploring the surrounding country; and in contributing to the pleasure of the invalid, who had become endeared to the whole family, and who, contrary to hope or expectation, seemed gradually gaining health and strength. Time sped on, and brought, not Edward, but letters. It was, he said, impossible for him to leave at present; his father's business required them both. There had been some heavy failures, which had in a measure involved them, and it would require some time to set all right again. He seemed to regret very much that it was so; but hoped to be able to meet them, upon their arrival in New York, and accompany them to Cliftonville. All joined in expressing the disappointment they shared equally; and Henry proceeded to open another letter, which had come by the same mail. Each one, absorbed in their own reflections, had become silent, and he read every word of the hateful missive to the end. It was from Tom Eldrich; and, as such, had it been written in good faith, and free from 22     254       CARRIE EMERSON. slander or falsehood, would have been far from welcome. His surprise at the effrontery of the fellow, in addressing him in terms almost of brotherly intimacy, after being shunned and slighted as he was in California, was great; but it was over- ruled by another, greater still. After speaking of some things that had transpired, exactly as he had been informed both by Edward and Carrie, and which gave the letter an appearance of truth it could never have possessed otherwise, he mentioned, as the most natural thing in the world, that rumor said,- and for once, from all appearances, spoke truth,--that the old flirtation between Edward Ashley and Carrie Emerson was drawing to a close; that the young lady, at last, was glad to come to any terms; and that a very hasty marriage, he supposed, would speak for itself. He was very sorry; Car- rie was a pretty girl, but a consummate flirt. There was a time when he had some idea of proposing, himself; but, thanks to his better reason, he was saved. He blamed the girl's mother more than he did her. Why did n't she keep a better watch over her? If it were one of his sisters, he would curse, and quit her. lie thanked God, his sisters were very different girls from that! A low, deep groan attracted all eyes to Irving; who, after the first involuntary outhurst, was struggling fearfully, but inwardly, for calmness. There was no time for reason to urge her claims; surprise had robbed her of the power. Every  faculty was benumbed. The power to move seemed equally  taken from him; for he looked like a marble statue. The unbroken silence gave him time to collect his thoughts, and get his outraged senses under control again; when the first word put them to flight. It was a regret for Edward;   CARRIE EMERSON.          .255 it was too much, and he rose to leave the room. A look of intense pain darted over Percy's face. He thrust the letter into his hand, and left the room. Every eye now turned upon Percy. His wasted strength was not equal to his affectionate sympathy; and tears, weak perhaps and womanish, but impossible to restrain, sprang to his eyes. Donna Maria came directly forward, and bent over him. "It was wrong to distress you," she said, gently, " whatever news-Mr. Irving's letter might contain. I trust it is only upon his account you are so agitated." Percy shuddered, as for a moment his eye rested upon the sweet face of Isabel, who, though she had not .been an un- moved witness of the scene, was far from dreaming that it could possibly affect her. She caught the look of Percy, and in an instant was at his side. "Tell me," she said, almost in a whisper, as she knelt beside him, and clasped his thin, al- most transparent, hand in her own, ," does what you have read concern me at all?" "  Do not ask me," he faintly articulated. "I had hoped never to listen to another tale of perfidy. Go and ask my friend, Isabel, to tell you what bowed my frame, and crushed my heart; meantime he may gather a ray of hope. Things may not be as they seem." Her father, in the-mean while, had wrung the bitter truth from Henry, and they were pacing the corridor with slow and measured steps, when she made her appearance. She noticed the angry scowl on the brow of each, but it did not daunt her. She approached Henry, and repeated the words of Percy. "No need of any such roundabout way," said the don.     256       CARRI  E  SERSON. "Isabel, there is something painful to communicate; and the  sooner it is done, the better. Let me see, darling, if it will blanch your cheek, or break your heart, to learn that one    ^: whom you have chosen as a guide and protector, is a cold- : hearted villain."  "What mean you, father?" said the wondering Isabel.  "I mean just what I say. Edward Ashley is a villain '!  Before this time he is probably wedded to another -to the  affianced bride of Mr. Irving! --to the Carrie Emerson Juan thinks perfection!" The cheek of Isabel did not blanch, neither did her voice   : quiver, as she said, "Who told you all this, father?" "' A friend, my dear," said her father, greatly relieved by  her calm, unshaken manner.  "I can almost forgive the scoundrel, dearest, since I find it does not affect you more.  It is passing strangec however. I thought to find you weak   i and fiagilel my Isabel, and that words such as I have used   j would kill you." "t And so perhaps they would, my dear father, if for one single moment I believed them; but I do not! The thing is utterly impossible!" she said, rapidly, as the warm, passion- ate blood came from the heart to the face. "Edward is too noble and generous to be the guilty thing you named!" "I think so too," said her mother, whose curiosity had drawn her to the spot. "Do you remember how near our own happiness was to being shipwrecked in just such an insidious way?" "I had forgotten it, Maria; but I believe you are right." They returned to the parlor together, and Henry read the hateful letter aloud. It seemed to sting him anew; for he   CARRIE EMERSON.          257 crushed it bitterly, and flung it from him as he would a viper. Isabel watched him with tearful eyes. "Man's faith," she said, smiling sadly, "is, I see, not half as strong as wo- man's." But, my dear young lady, what have I to hope? If you were in my place, what would you trust to?" "I am  in your place, exactly; and I am trusting my almost all of earthly happiness to the honor of one who shall yet prove that rumor without foundation. I know," she added, " it is false!" "Did not the same person deceive you once before?" asked Percy.  "Yes; but then he judged from appearances, and they proved false." And how do you know but he does the same now? He only tells what rumor says. I thought you intended being married immediately upon your return." "Well, I did; but don't you see he not only speaks of her as preparing to wed, but in haste? The fact is, I trusted too much to his honor and brotherly affection." "His excuse for not coming was a paltry one," said the don. "A man doing the business his father is, might com- mand facilities enough, not to depend so much upon his son. I mean to ride over to Martino's to-morrow, and make some inquiries. Perhaps we can glean something from him." "And you will suspend your judgment until you hear more," said Isabel. ( I feel, dear father, as if the whole story were a fabrication. It is not in human nature, I mean in Edward's nature, to be so base." 22* t     258       CARRIE EMERSON. "And what shall you say, my dear child, if it prove true?" "I shall rejoice, my dear father, that I escaped. But it will not be so. If it were true, I should have some fear, some presentiment or harrowing foreboding; which I have not. I would sooner die than doubt him!" she added, feel- ingly. "Such faith as yours, Isabel, is worthy of a rich reward; but, in a world like this, there is too much hollow-hearted perfidy, to allow perfect faith in any one. Your experience has been drawn chiefly from books. You have been too ten- derly reared, and too closely secluded, to allow you to judge of the world as it is." "Well, my young friends," said Bernardo, "if you cannot draw any comfort from Isabel's faith and hopefulness, you can at least suspend judgment until you hear more. After all, it may be without foundation. I shall insist upon your prolonging your visit until something more definite is known. Mr. Hamilton will be gaining strength, and you will be no loser." "I think," said Henry, "I had better return at once; any- thing is better than suspense." Isabel smiled. "You must dismiss it from your mind," she said, gently. "If you have known Edward all your life, how can you believe him base or guilty?" There is truth in what she says, Mr. Irving. I begin to feel as if I had been too hasV in condemning hiim." The wrathful feeling in Henry 's mind was beginning to die away before the general calm that pervaded the little family, and he felt half ashamed for having so hastily given way to   CARRIE  EMERSO N.        259 doubt and suspicion, when the whole story depended for au- thenticity upon rumor. Next day the fiiends accompanied Bernardo to Mr. Mar- tino's, and in a casual way made some inquiries. Mr. Mar- ting spoke in high terms of young Mr. Ashley. He was well acquainted with the intricacies of the affairs at the present time; it was next to impossible for Edward to leave his father just then. "I heard yesterday," said Bernardo, " that the young man was about to be married." "Must be a mistake, sir. Mr. Ashley senior gave me di- rections about having a handsome house erected in the vicini- ty of this place, for his son's residence, to be finished in about a year. I purchased a spot, selected by the young man, and have commenced building. I am positive he is not to be married before that time, because it was so specified. I was to spare no expense in the building, laying out the grounds, and furnishing. Edward is an only son; and his father will not be niggardly in expenditure." "What do you think?" said Bernardo, as they rode slowly homeward. "I do not know what to think," said Henry. "It will be mighty strange, if I have twice been the dupe of the same person." A week passed almost imperceptibly away, and hope was again springing up in the bosom of Henry. It was almost sinful to doubt when he looked in the sweet face of Isabel, and saw how truthful was her happiness. Percy, like her, would not listen to doubt. He had learned his lesson too late to benefit himself; but he could, and did     260       CARnr I EMERSON. warn another. A favorable turn seenled to have taken place in his disorder. The gentle, soothing care of Isabel and her mother was workinlg miracles; he might yet recover. The doctor positively asserted that six weeks in the place, with such nursing, would restore him fully; ind Henry had con- cluded to leave him with such kind friends as they had proved themselves, and go home without delay. IIc was in the midst of his preparations when Juan arrived. He had been away at school, and had come home to spend the vacation. He was not long in gathering from Isabel her knowledge of the strangers, and the whispered rumor from Cliftonville. TTe had received a letter from his friend Carrie, encloscd in one from Edward. The boy's black eyes flashed lire, as he listened to the hateful tale of calumny. I N"Who told such an abominable story?" he ejaculated. "There is not a single word of truth in it! AWho dares to call El. Ashley a scoundrel? I 'll shoot any one who dares say it!" said the incensed boy. "You did n't believe it, Bel." "No, Juan ; never, for a single moment." "That's like my darling sister!" he said, kissing her glow- ing check. "Leave it to me, Bel. I'll fix him, if there's any virtue in my new revolver! I shan't stand tamely by, and hear my friends slandered!" "' Not so fast, young gentleman!" said his father, looking proudly upon his only son. "Wait until you have the proofs, bcefre you talk of shooting any one." The proofs!  hy, I hproof! hy I roofs enough in my pocket!" pulling out a letter, as he spoke. "Now, I suppose it is a breach of confidence; but Carrie Emerson will forgive all tha, in consideration that it is to vindicate her truth and   CARRIE EMERSON.          261 honor that I do it. So read for yourself, Bel. Nay, read it, aloud; there 's nothing there to hide. 'T is just like her; the soul of truth and honor, candor and generosity." "MY DEAR JUAN: I am exceedingly busy, but Edward will enclose my letter with one of his own, so I hasten to write. I was so happy to hear that you were well through your last term, and would soon enter college, that I forgot it would be the means of taking you far away from your beloved home; and I have heard too much of college life, not to dread its influence upon one so young and ardent as yourself. You will find a vast difference between that and home influences; but you will carry with you, I trust, enough to protect you. I gave you, in my last, all the village news, as far as it could in- terest you. It is a quiet place; and, you know, I visit but very little. And now, Juan, I am going to tell you a secret, and give you an insight into a little of my future. I say se- cret, because, having received some bitter lessons from med- dling, I have come to the conclusion that, in this instance, at least, it will be better to keep people in the dark. And so, Juan, why I am so exceedingly busy is because I am going to be married! You know I told you, once before, the match was broken off by something Tom Eldrich had said or insinuated. Well, through the interposition of a dear and valued 'friend, -although I have met him but once,-the matter was set right; and, as my faith was not much shaken in Henry Irv- ing, I trust he will learn to regard me with equal generosity. He, in company with Mr. Hamilton,-- the fiiend I named,- are to pass some little time in Havana; and Edward has given them letters to your- father. I suppose ere this they are with     262       CARRIE E MERSON. you; so you will please tell me, in your next, how you like my choice. Mother and Willie send much love. They long to see you, Juan; and Edward, dear Edward, is as kind and true-hearted and noble as ever. Whenever I look back to the past, and remember how very miserable I was at one time,- for, though I did not doubt Henry's faith, he did mine, and we were at variance, and consequently both unhappy,--my heart always beats with gratitude to Edward; who, though he could not fathom the mystery, and although he had been cheated both in love and friendship himself, nobly forgot his own trials, to soothe and cheer me And that is like him, always; he has the least selfishness about him of any person I ever knew. Sometimes I imagine, from the way he speaks of a sister of yours, that he has met a kindred spirit, and that an attachment has sprung up between them. I do not like to ask him; if he wished it known, he would speak of it openly - and, I know from experience, he dreads scandal. But, if such a thing should be, do not let her doubt him, Juan. She can never find a nobler or a better; and that is the highest eulogium in my power to bestow. If it had not been for the proofs of man's honor and truth in him, I should, perhaps, have some fears for my future. But Henry was his chosen friend, long years before I knew him; and Henry is the coun- terpart of Edward. I do not like to anticipate; the world is full of changes, and, young as I am, I have had a share; but I trust ere long to be happily settled in B.; and, in some of your long vacations, I shall have you with me. Once more, all join in love to you, dear Juan. Now, as ever, yours, "ARRIE."   CARRIE  EMERSON.         263 There was a dead silence for a few moments after the sound of Isabel's voice had died away; but looks were eloquent, as all in that group could attest. Juan was the first to break silence. "I think the man who doubts Carrie Emerson does not deserve her!" "Just what I think," said Henry; " and lest another story grow out of rumor, I 'll hasten to make her mine." "Right!" said Bernardo, shaking him heartily by the hand;-" and Bel--" But Isabel had flitted. She, with her woman's faith so sweetly strengthened, wanted the solitude of her own chamber, to examine her heart, and see if it were not too surely an idol she was garnering there; and, if it were, must she deem it only common clay?  But there was no danger of idolatry. Isabel was too high-minded for that; and hers was a love that accorded well with her pure and lovely character. Henry took his leave with some regret; for Percy was still feeble, and it might be some time before they met again,- yet he felt he was more likely to recover there than anywhere else. With the promise of some time bringing Carrie to visit them, he departed; and, some days before any one thought of expecting him, he was in their midst. Tom Eldrich was, as he expressed himself,'thunder- struck" when a note from Henry Irving, requesting him to call at Mrs. Emerson's, was put into his hand. He started as if an adder had stung him. "Good God, girls!" he said, pacing the floor nervously, ,     264       CARRIE EMERSON. "just tell me where you got your information, the other day, concerning Carrie Emerson!" "O, we heard of it!" said Lu. "You don't think we made it, do you?" "Somebody made it, I rather think. At any rate, if I may judge from what I hold in my hand, I'm about to be called to an account for something I can't answer for. I wrote a friendly letter to Henry Irving, giving him a hint of what I had heard, and he has travelled post, I should think. Grudging enough, too, of his words: Mr. Thomas Eldrich will please meet me at Mrs. Emerson's, as soon as possible.- H. InvIsN.' I call that deuced cool, any way! The sooner it is over, the better - though I 'd rather start for California again! You'd better hold yourselves in readiness, girls; he may call you to an account, also." "I shan't go near them," said Mary. "They don't pretend to notice us, now; in fact, they have n't for a long time." "I declare I won't go," said Lu. "I did n't hear any one but Mary say anything; and it is n't very likely I shall tell what she said." "Well, what did it start from,- or rather, where?" "I promised not to tell," said Mary, "and I won't. The one that told me, simply said ' They say;' and I should think it was a great deal to make a fuss about!" "They say' makes a great deal of trouble sometimes, my dear sis; and, for the future, I advise you to drop the ac- quaintance." "The same to yourself, Tom! You are as fond as any one else of spreading the news." I wonder," said Mary (as Tom left the room, upon his   CARRIE EMiERSON.          265 disagreeable interview, which, lest I sheuld nrot do it full jus- tice, I leave to the imagination of the reader), hIow Mrs. Bun- combe will get over her share of the story? ; "O, she 'll declare she never said a word about it! That's the way she gets over things." And, sure enough, the whole story was palmed off upon "They say; " and Henry had the satisfaction of knowing that he had twice been made the dupe of village gossip. 23     CHAPTER XXI.

"Do you think he will like it, Henry?" said the soft voice of Carrie Emerson, as she sat, with her lover and Edward, upon the turf that covered Ellen Grant.

' It was all her poor, broken  heart craved; and if, as I believe, departed spirits sometimes revisit earth, Ellen has long known how truly she has been  both loved and lamented." "Yes, Carrie, Percy will like it; why should he not?

"Do you think he will never recover his health?" said Edward. , Isabel seems to have strong hopes of him, lately." "Isabel is an angel, Ed.! If Percy does not recover, it will be no fault of hers. Are you not jealous, Mr. Edwaid Ashley? You may thank your lucky stars that another star was shining in my pathway, else I might have coveted your treasure. And now, Carrie, you must make up your mind to say adieu to this lovely spot,- your mother will watch over it in your absence, I know,-and brsh away your tears; there should be only smiles for a bridal - and you will be a bride to-morrow, Carrie." "I wish Isabel was here, and we could make one ceremony answer; don't you, Ed.?" Edward laughed gayly.. "No, Harry, no! She won't con- sent to that, anyhow. She 's afraid the good rector will make a mistake, and put me in your place. But never mind, I'll be proud, as the saying is, to follow in the footsteps of my glorious predecessors; and, before many moons have waned, you shall dance atmy wedding. So take courage, Carrie dear; never fear but I 'll follow a good example. And now cheer up; don't look as if you were leaving the dear old place forever. Many and many a time we 'll gather round the hearth-stone, or beneath the vine-wreathed porch, of your home at Cliftonville, and talk over old times. See, here is your mother coming to meet us. If she feels sad at the thought of parting with you, she is too sensible, or too kind to show it. Perhaps, like me, she is sanguine enough to see only happiness in your future. At any rate, it is best always     268       CARRIE EMERSON. to enjoy the sunshine while it lasts; is it not, Mrs. Emer- son?" "Yes, my dear Edward; and when the heavy cloud o'er- shadows us, look for its silvery lining. "I have just been making a call at the parsonage house. You remember Aimie Lee, Henry? Well, she is Mrs. Spaul- ding, now - a happy wife and mother; for, although death has folded his dark wings just above the little, crib, and is only waiting a brief moment before he sets his seal upon the cherub face, she is calm, and peaceful, and submissive as if the three-fold chord was nqyer to be parted." "Do you remember what the people said when Mr. Spaul- ding first married Annie?" said Edward; "that he would repent it before six months; and how they all pitied him for the miserabl! choice he had made; that Annie was gay, and light-hearted, and thoughtless, and could never understand, much less appreciate, a man like Mr. Spaulding? I know I used to think, if half the predictions proved true, Annie's chance of happiness was a slight one." "Yes, Edward, I remember all that; and I remember, too, when, soon after they were wedded, and he was prostrated by slow fever, and became so debilitated that there was a debate among the leading members of the church about retaining hin,-some thought, because his strength had failed him, his energy and eloquence were wasted; and then his salary was insufficient, and if they gave more, they wanted to get tlreM money 's worth ; that's how they expressed it, -Annie came nobly to the rescue. She wrote for him, visited for him, prayed for him; she soothed, comforted and supported him; warded off everything that could possibly annoy or wound his   CARRIE EIMERSON.         269 sensitive nature, until that nature rallied, and health and strength came back to cheer them both. I always told you she would make a noble, self-sacrificing woman; and she has, in every sense of the word." "So Cora's little namesake is going to leave us, and Annie will not be present at the ceremony," said Carrie, sadly; " well, it will not seem so strange, our going to B." "No; as Henry prefers the Episcopal service, it will be better as he has arranged it. Annie sent her love and best wishes, as did her husband; and when you are quietly settled, they will visit you. Good-night," she said, as Edward took his leave, "come soon as possible in the morning; we start early." The morrow was glorious.  The fresh sea-breeze was sweeping through the fine old woods at Cliftonville. The wild bird's carol came sweetly ringing on the ear, and the scent of the rose and sweet-brier was wafted along on its un- seen wings. It came in at the open window, and fanned the soft cheek of the dying babe ; while the young mother bent over and wiped the death-dew from its pallid brow. Her husband knelt beside her, his hand clasped within one of hers, and his face buried in the pillow that supported his only child. "It is all over, Edwin," she said, faintly; "let us thank our God that the struggle was so brief, -that the separation is only for a season.", "Shut out the sunlight, Annie; it seems too glaring for a scene like this." Annie shut out the sunbeam, and it came quivering in through the high-atrched window of a stately edifice, and shed a soft and cheering light upon a fair young brow, where orange 23*     270       CAR RIE E IMER SON. flowers were resting. The massive organ sent fortn its ceep- toned voice; the impressive service was said, the response was uttered, and still the sunbeam quivered and kept time with the beating hearts now and forever united. I shall miss the dear old woods, and rocky cliffs of Clif- tonville," said Carrie, softly, as she ushered her mother through her spacious drawing-rooms. "( I shall try to be rec- oncled to city life, for Henry likes it best; and we shall come often to see you, especially after Percy gets here; he writes very cheerful letters; but Ellen's grave will often draw him to Cliftonville." Percy is here!" said a deep-toned voice; and the speak. er came forward, and imprinted a kiss upon her glowing cheek. Surprise overcame her for a moment, and tears sprang to her eyes. "I meant to have been here in time for the ceremony," he said, shaking hands warmly with Edward, "but was de- layed; and now I am first to greet and welcome you to your new home,- mine too, Carrie!  You see I claim a brother's privilege, and dispense with formality. I must have a home with you and Henry. "I congratulate you, Mrs. Emerson," he said, grasping her hand, as Carrie introduced him to her mother; " few are so blessed as yourself in the possession of such a daughter, or son. In my opinion there are few better men living than Henry Irving." "Iow delighted he will be!" said Carrie, a bright smile sparkling through her tears; "it is such an unexpected pleas- ure. And how did you leave our friends?" Well - quite well," he said, handing a package of letters   CARRIE 2I7EMERSON.        271 to Edward. "Isabel longs to see you, Carrie. When will she have that pleasure?  "O, soon!" glancing at Edward.  I have promised to make one at her bridal; and I know it will not be very long. But here comes Henry." They met as brothers, and a happier group never gatherer round a social board than graced Carrie's first dinner in her new home. Anon came the gay and brilliant wedding-party, and with grace and beauty Carrie moved amidst them; for, though beauty, wealth and fashion, reigned supreme, they could not eclipse her. Mrs. Emerson and her husband gazed proudly and fondly upon their child; and her mother saw with heart- felt happiness that, amidst the glitter and glare that sur- rounded her, she was safe; for there too were the talented, the intellectual and sincere; and she solemnly thanked God for the trial that had chastened and subdued, and left those two young hearts so purified and strengthened for the future. While they are so pleasantly and happily engaged, let us leave them, and visit some others who feign .or feel an interest in our heroine. Colonel Macy a!nd his son are quietly sipping their wine; their dinner was siimptuous, and the dessert is profuse. They are alone, and of 'course feel at perfect liberty to make what remarks they please. "I heard to-day that Percy Hamilton had returned, and was going into business at B." "Did you? Why, I thought he went to Italy, and died there." "No, he did n't die, though he tried mighty hard to do so.     272       CARRIE EMERSON. His ill-treatment and neglect of his wife at one time worried him so that he was well-nigh distracted. It served him right though ; -a man who marries a woman just because she pleases his fancy, deserves to suffer. They say he was forever finding fault with her; and she, so gentle and affectionate, and so ready to sacrifice every pleasure to gratify his silly whims, all to no purpose! And when he treated her so ill that she was absolutely afraid of him, who could blame her for leaving him, and fleeing to her mother for protection?" "Why, no one, of course. Perhaps it was a plan of his own, Ellen Grant's disappearing in such a queer way. I'll bet he knew where she went.  I shouldn't wonder if he het'ed draw up that will. He knew Angela as a daughter would fare better than a dependent in the family. If Angela hadn't been afraid of him, do you suppose she would have gone off with Garcia?" "I heard that she didn't elope; that it was a rumor set afloat by Hamilton just to hide his own conduct. Garcia happened to leave just then, and he sent her off at the same time, just to set the story going." ( Poor thing! she was no more calculated to be that man's wife than a mere baby; and yet how fair and smooth he always appeared!" You are mistaken, my dear sir; any one, to look at him, might know he had a high, fiery temper. Why, when her mother tried to reason the case, he raved like a madman; and I have heard it hinted (of course it might have been ex- aggerated that he followed her to an obscure place,-else how came he there just then? - and threatened and frightened her half out of her wits; and if the poor thing did throw herself   CARRIE EM ERSO N.         273 into the river, -at any rate she was taken out of it, and people you know can suppose what they please." "Well, 'peace to her ashes!' I 'm thankful she was not my child. e Where did you say he was going to locate?" "In B., in company with a Mr. Irving, and he is about to marry the young lady Edward Ashley flirted so violently with when Adde dismissed him so unceremoniously." "Adde was fortunate in getting rid of him as she did. She leads a gayer life than she would with him. I suppose he 'd think her really dissipated, if he was obliged to foot the bills; but she does give splendid parties, and dresses superbly. I wish sometimes they were a little more domestic." "So do I, father; but if they are satisfied, we surely ought to be. It seems, sometimes, she don't see him for a week, un- less they happen to meet at a fashionable party. They keep late hours, occupy separate chambers, and keep separate purses; but it suits them, and they seem perfectly satisfied with each other; and, as long as they are so, we can't com- plain." "Of course not; by and by they 'll settle down into quiet life, and we shall have hard work to get them out at all." Another little group are chatting gayly; let us listen a moment. "Did you know, girls, that Irving had gone into the mer- cantile business, and taken a splendid house at the West End; and, in short, is going to be made miserable by putting his neck into the yoke?" "No, indeed, Tom! But I thought something was going on over at the Emersons; they are so secret, there's no finding     274       CAtRIE EMERSON. much out, though. I suppose Miss Carrie will hold her head higher than ever now." "Very likely she will, but who cares?--a little, insignifi- cant thing! I don't believe she can carry out any such grand style any better than we could." ; I wonder where she 'll be married? This little, obscure place won't do at all." "I heard at the Trinity," said Tom. "I 'll be there and witness the ceremony, just to make sure there is one." u That's right, Tom," said Mrs. Eldrich; " don't you never trust to 'they say' again." A merry laugh burst from the lips of a pretty girl. "You are behind the time, cousin Tom, for all ' they say' you're always wide awake. I saw them married myself, this morning, at Grace church." "You did! Why, Lucy! how came you to be there?" "O, I understood there was to be a wedding; and, as every one else would be there, of course I must make one of the number. I'm glad I did; the bride looked splendid." "Dressed to death, and all the drawers and bandboxes empty," said Lu. with a sneer; "I can imagine it." "If you mean by that, that she was overdressed," said Lucy, " pardon me if I say you are sadly mistaken. Her dress was rich, and all the ornaments in keeping;' but it was in perfect taste,--perfect. And as to the bride herself, I thought her one of the most beautiful young ladies I ever saw; and her husband is as handsome and dignified as you can well imagine. I'm sorry you was n't there, cousin Tom; you don't know what you've lost." Pho, Lucy! What do you suppose I 've lost?"   CARRIE EMERSON.         275 "Perhaps the privilege of reporter; they say you 're capi- tal at that!" ' Do you mean to be personal, Lucy?" "Personal? O no! but I had heard such a different de- scription ever since I first began to hear of her at all, that I could hardly believe it to be the same person, and yet I know it was. 'You recollect, girls, what you said; that she was homely as sin; had an everlasting scowl upon her face; was round-shouldered; always looked dowdy; and a lot more I can't think of now. And, Tom, you know you told me,--and it's the self-same young lady, because you all own she's the only Carrie Emerson in the place, or rather she was,- that you had flirted with her just to amuse yourself, and that when you went to California, she pined away and came near dying. O, Tom!" "Well, what of it, Lucy?" "Ask'your own conscience," said the lively girl. "You must know I have been making Sue Hammet a visit, and they had a deal to say about some affair in which Miss Emerson's name had got mixed up; and, having heard you, at different times, ridicule her, I became interested, and heard another version of the story; so, when they told me she was to be married in church, I resolved to make one of the number, and, I repeat, I'm glad I did. I insist upon it, Tom, you lost a great deal, for she 's a charming-looking girl, and, if the face is an index of the mind, it was something to lose her good opinion - that is, if you ever had it to lose." " , Lucy! you are getting sarcastic; and, lest you should say something more biting, I 'll take a stroll up town." "Take care, cousin,' said Lucy, with a look of mock grav-     276       CARRIE EI E R SON. ity, " what you pick up by the wayside! You know scandal, like Jonah's gourd, often springs up in a night, and mixes itself in so prettily with other flowers, that sometimes you gather more than perhaps you are aware of; and somehow every one is apt to imbibe the odor. I have a particular aversion to it; you remember I always had!" Tom made a sudden exit, muttering, he wished Lucy had staid at home; it was deuced annoying to have cousins round; they always thought themselves endowed with family privileges, and Lucy especially would say just what she pleased. Lucy looked after him a moment with a peculiar smile, and she thought to herself, you 'd be quite an agreeable young gentleman, Tom, if you could be cured of one evil propensity; and, sure as my name is Lucy Eldrich, you shall have the benefit of my satire, if that's what you please to consider it. "Come, girls," she said, "don't let us mope here this lovely evening; let's follow Tom's example and take a stioll; call on your friend M1rs. Buncombe; you have n't mentioned her name since I came." "We don't go there very often," said Mary; " but if you wish we T'l call with you. I warn you, however." "O, never fear! I 've no wish to cultivate her acquaint- ance, only want to gratify my curiosity. But you surprise nm; I thought she was very intimate here. Do you recollect, when I was here last, how often she came? Have you had any trouble with her?" "O no; but we don't think as much of her as we did; we "   CARRIE EMERSON.          2" The same peculiar smile arrested the sentence, and ,Mary turned toward the glass to smooth her hair and put on her bonnet, determined in her own mind that she would not pro- voke one of cousin Lucy's reproofs, whtever Tom might do. Mrs. Buncombe was delighted to have her dear friends call upon her just then; she was just that moment wishing for them; it was so quiet, the place was growing intolerable; she might as well be in the backwoods as there. There was n't a soul thought of her now except Allie Cameron, and she was three or four miles off."  "Did Allie tell you Carrie Emerson was to be married so soon; or did n't she know it?" "Carrie Emerson, ha! ha! I hope I shan't have the headache till she gets married. A man must be a fool to think of taking her for better or worse. I 'm afraid it would be all worse and no better," and she laughed gayly at her own wit. "Do you really think so, Mrs. -Buncombe?" said Lucy. "Now I confess I think him an enviable object; and, believe me, he's no fool." "Of whom are you speaking, Miss Eldrich?" "Why, of Mr. Irving, Carrie's husband, of course." "She 's not married?" "She is, most certainly;" and a glowing description fol- lowed. "O, pshaw!". said Mrs. Buncombe; " how long da you think her beauty and happiness will last? I know some- thing from experience. Men are mighty changeable; they 'll make you think you are perfection, and themselves ditto; but 24 I      278       CARRIE EMERSON. they soon throw off the mask, and then we find that what we thought was happiness is all moonshine." "Well, I hope Mrs. Irving will prove an exception," said Lucy. "I don't," said Mrs. Buncombe; " misery loves company, and I hope she 'll have a good share. We can get along very well at Cliftonville without her; but I don't see what Ed. Ashlcy 's going to do?" "Do like the rest, I suppose," said Mary. "He don't care a copper for any one in Cliftonville, except the Emersons; so it is not here he 'll look for a wife." Six months have happily sped on, and a gay group have assembled at the villa of --- . Stately dons and bright- eyed senoritas are there. Our friends, Percy, Irving, and Carrie, are in their midst, and Juan's flashing eye and elo- quent tongue can tell how warm their welcome. All eyes are turned upon the bride and bridegroom. Fond, trusting, peer- less Isabel! thy happiness is in the keeping of one who will guard it well. Noble, manly and brave, he is well worthy the trust, as all feel who gaze upon his handsome face. "Dear, dear Edward!" said Carrie, as she sat with the young bride beneath the shade of a clustering vine; ( I can never tell you how fervently I rejoice in his happiness." "Tears, Carrie!" said Juan; " why, what is the matter? You or Isabel can surely find little to cry about; now I could n't scare up as much as a sigh, let alone a tear. Women are strange mortals." "Well, they are not sorrowful ones, Juan; so don't look at '                   CARRIE  EMERSON.         279 me with that rueful countenance. Your sister understands me, if you do not." "Well, I don't like tears; they spoil your eyes. And now please tell me something of Cliftonville." "What shall I tell you, Juan? You know every nook and corner as well as I do." "I know I do, Carrie. Is n't it a lovely place?" t"Magnificent, some parts of it." "I long to visit it once more, and show Bel. some of its beauties. She thinks, because she has visited some of the far- famed watering-places, there is nothing beyond. She shall go with us to the summit of Sunset Rock, the Pirate's Cave, Violet Glen; climb with us the white, shining cliffs, when the dark blue wave is circling their base! And O, Carrie, she shall brave, as we have done, the howling, furious blast, when it is lashing the beach, making it roar with a voice of thunder; see the white foam of the breakers, as it springs up from its ocean bed; watch the proud ships, as they careen to the blast; see them come booming on close in to the pitiless rocks; hear the deep shout of the hardy reefers, I' Man the life-boat! ' and then watch their slow and perilous progress as they sink in the sea's deep trough, or climb the mountain wave. You may, in my opinion, traverse half the globe, and find no one place where beauty, grandeur, or sublimity, is more touch- ingly displayed." "And yet, Juan, there is many a one, who visits Clifton- ville, who can see nothing at all attractive. We 've had peo- ple come to make us a long visit, who would get tired in a week, and vote it the dullest of dull places, and ridicule me unmercifully if I undertook to point out any of its beauties.     280       CARRIE EMERSON. Some of the residents, too, who have spent all their lives there, would laugh at the idea of rambling the woods, or climbing the rocks and hills." "I know it, Carrie, but Bel won't do any such foolish thing. She has an eye to the beautiful, and she will love the place, if it is only that Edward's home is there. I tell you what, though; when that rumor reached here about you and Ed., Cliftonville and all its belongings went down pretty sud- den in my estimation. I would liked to have had old Nep- tune give some of the good people a shower-bath, just to wash away the meddling propensity with which they are in- fec ted. What say you, Bel?" "O, Juan, it did not matter! It only gave my faith a trial; and, after all, Cliftonville is no worse than any other place. There are many noble hearts there, I dare say." "Yes, there are," said Carrie, "and you must love it, dear Isabel, for my sake as well as Edward's. We may find fairer spots, but to me there will never be one dearer. I wish in my heart they may all be as blest as we are." "That 's like you, Carrie," said Edward, coming towards her; "always ready to forgive' injuries. But don't promise yourself too much felicity. When we make the promised visit to our dear old Cliftonville, my old mischief propensity may return; and, for the sake of making a stir in the camp, I may ask you to go out to Aunt Maria's; or to take a sail down the river; or I shall give your pony a sly cut, just for the fun of catching the runaway and kissing the rescued. Bcl will be there; but then she won't see half as much as some transient looker-on will; and then won't she have any amount of sympathy? and won't some of my worthy friends    *  CARRIE EMERSON.         281 say, 'I told you so'? And yet, for all that, I long to show the good people that, with all my faults, I have managed to secure for myself a guardian angel, wh6o if I should step aside, would bpth pity and forgive me one who has proved that Amf      (TV" Woman's love is a holy light."' "And you should add," said the young bride, "'That, when 't is kindled, ne'er can die; But lives, though treachery and slight To quench the constant flame may try. Its joy to meet, its death to part, Its sepulchre a broken heart.'" "A truce to broken hearts, Bel," said Juan, gayly. "If Percy should happen to hear that, he'd have the blues for a week. For mercy's sake spare him. all you can of memory or misery!" "It takes him a long time to forget; don't it Carrie?" "Iie 'll never forget, Ed. I am in hopes, however, he will be persuaded to join us in our tour upon the continent. After all, there 's nothing like change. I thought, when he rallied and entered into business with Harry, he was surely going to regain both health and sirits; but somehow it seems only transitory, and I am really afraid he 's in a decline." "Pho! nonsense, Carrie! He has n't a consumptive symp- tom about him; no cough, no hectic. How can you think that of Percy?" "O, well, all that may be true! Consumlption, you know, is an insidiousf oe, and assumes many shapes. I hope I am mistaken, truly." "I love Percy just as well as if he were my brother, and 24*     282       CARRIE EMERSON. should mourn for him as sincerely as I should for Willie or you, Ed." "Just hear that, Bel! right before your face!" "Well, I reciprocate the sentiment, Edward. I, too, should mourn for Percy; he is so good, and was with us so long, you know, you would n't think it wrong." (No, dearest, I should think it wrong, perhaps, if you did not. But here he comes; so away with your tears. Remember he is not to be. infected with the blues." "Coec, Percy"- - making room for him--"you 'l join our little party, wonl't you? Carrie and Bel say they can't get along without you." "Neither can I without them; so, of course, I must go." And, as they will be absent some months, we 'll leave them to all the enjoyment so justly theirs, and go back to dear old Cliftonville. Pelrhaps you 'll say, (I 'm tired of picking up scandal." So am I. I rather think we can gather from the wayside a few redeeming traits which shall put the Back- biters to shame.   CHAPTERE XXII. As the rivers, farthest flowing, In the highest hills have birth; As the banyan, broadest growing, Oftenest bows its head to earth, - So the noblest minds press onward, Channels far of good to trace; So the largest hearts bend downwards, Circling all the human race. MRS. HALE. "WHY, bless me, Jennie! where are you going in such haste?" said Cora Leavitt.  "I was coming to ask you to walk with me on the beach.  It must be splendid there this morning." "I would, Cora, with pleasure, but I cannot possibly. I have just heard that Mr. Spaulding has accepted an invita- tion to go out as missionary. You know he has been thinking of it for some time." "O, Jennie, don't say that!" and tears sprang to the bright eyes of Cora.  "What shall we' do without them?" "It is too bad, I know, Cora! Of course we expected to part with them soon, as his time has expired. That is all I dislike in the Methodist discipline; no sooner do we begin     2S 1       CARRIE EMERSON. to appreciate and get attached to the minister, than he is sent solnmwhere else, and ten to one we get some prosy dead-and- alive soul, it is impossible to get accustomed to, or interested in. Still, we oughllt to feel grateful; they hardly ever stay but one year, and we 've had brother Spaulding two." "I know it, Jcnllie. I suppose we are at fault. We should not allow ourselves to become so much attached to any one of them , we ought to regard them all alike; they are all striving' to do the Master's will, and, if they meet with a lack of sympathly or fellowship, they must feel it very acutely." Yes they must, and half the time it is a mere matter of fancy with us. I often think of poor old Mr. Srague, with his large family, and invalid wife. Who could say from the heart he was not a faithful shepherd,-I came near saying over a rebellious flock? But every one had some fault to find, and finally they petitioned the Conference, and had him removed. Poor old man,! I used to feel sleepy in church, and would often catch at the shadow of an excuse to absent myself, be- cause, as everybody said, he was dull and prosy; and then the little impediment in his speech did n't matter, but he made such queer grimaces when he became earnest, that I couldn't bear to look at him ; and yet, when he preached his farewell sermon, I never felt worse in my life. I declare he was truly eloquent then."' "So he was ; and, after all, I don't know but he would have dne as miuch good, in his way, if he had remained, as a youtrger and iiore fivored one. What became of him, I wonlder?  "Why, did n't you hear? lie went to another place, and they found the same fault we did; and he was finally set aside   CARRIE EMERSON.          285 with what they call the superannuated class. Poor old man! he laid it to heart so much that it affected his reason, and now he is just about half-crazed. The fund for the mainten- ance of such is not, I believe, a very sufficient one, and his children were obliged to go out into the world, and toil early and late for the support of the invalid parents. O, Cora, how little we think or know of the sufferings of others! - we, especially, who have home and kindred, and are removed far above the reach of want. We are young, it is true, and do not have a voice in church or state affairs,- for which we ought to be thankful; but, for all that, there are many things we might do; and that reminds me of where I was going when I met you. Come, Cora, go with me, won't you? I'll explain as we go along; it is better than walking on the beach; we can do that any time." "Well, Jennie; I'm with you, and now what is it? You surely would not try to discourage Annie?" ( Discourage her! Why, Cora, what a simpleton you are! Why, if I were a minister's wife, and he felt it to be his voca- tion to enlighten the heathen, I'd make it mine, whether 'it were or not. I 'd enter heart and soul into the good work. No, indeed; far from discouraging, I mean to encourage her, though I shall hate to part with her as much as any one; and, what is more substantial, since her mind is made up, I'm going to offer to help her get ready for the voyage. They've only got about two weeks, I hear." "Let's call upon Mrs. White, and get her to put it before the society. They might help, in various ways." "Nonsense! let's go upon our own responsibility, Cora; we shall do as much again."     "28G    CARRIE EMERSON. (), Jennie! how prejudiced you are against our circle! You hardly ever mect with us now; you don't know how we progr'ess ; and still you talk of doing good. I know you al- ways send your money as an equivalent, but I think your pres'ence would be quite as beneficial." "( Really, Cora, you have learned to flatter, and you have grown eloquent in the good cause; for, although I often de- nounce sewing-circles, and have insisted upon it that there was more scandal disseminated than sewing accomplished, for all that, I honor the benevolent motive that first called thelm into existence. They have degenerated, Cora, that's all." "Come back, then, Jennie, and set us a good example; we need it sadly, I know." "Pho, Cora! don't say we! Whatever others may have done, you never was stilgmatized as one of the hateful class I've tried to shun. I'll meet with ,you, perhaps, next time, if only to keep you company. But here we are; so let's enter upoq1l our mission without delay." After a half hour's conversation, Jennie kindly and mod- estly proffered their services, and, to Cora's heartfelt satis. faction, they were promptly and affectionately accepted. "And after we are gone, you will go often and comfort my mother. She cannot yet be persuaded that it is our duty to leave home andl( kindred and country, brave the perils of sea, and the dangers of climate, for any amount of good we may be permitted to do the heathen. She pleads my husband's success at Cliftonville as a proof that he will be appreciated wherever the Conference might choose to send him. But it does not sway him at all. He has for a long time leaned   CARRIE EMERSON.          287 towards the project that is so wholly' engrossing him now, and I fear it would unfit him for future usefulness here. In fact, I know it is better for us to go." "And you are hopeful, dearest Annie, and resigned to whatever trials or hardships you may encounter?" said Jennie, kindly.  "O, yes, Jennie, perfectly! It is not the result of a hasty or flattering view of the subject. We have looked at it in every possible light; prayerfully, doubtingly, and, you may well believe, tearfully; and we have come to the conclusion, which I believe nothing earthly can alter, that it is our duty. "Now you know, as well as I do, that for a faithful servant of Christ to know his duty, is with him to do it. How could he answer to his conscience, were he to swerve or shrink? How could he, from the sacred desk, preach what he could not himself practise?' And how could I counsel him to aught against the dictates of conscience? - I, his all on earth, in one sense of the word; for he has neither father, mother, brother nor sister. I think I would sooner die than throw an impedi- ment in his way! It is not as if my mother were going to be left childless. I shall be the only lmissing one from a very large home circle. And, again, we must leave here at all events; our time has expired; and I have sometimes felt more repugnance at the thought of being located among strangers, with the fear of not pleasing, where there are so many fastid- ious and fault-finding ones generally, that it has done a great deal towards strengthening my resolution. "Come, girls; cheer up; don't look so sad. Life, you know, at best, is too short to be wasted in useless repinings. I know you will never forget me. We learned our A B C's     288       C A RR IE EM E RS N. together, mingled our childish sports, our girlhood's pleas. ures, our woman's deepest, holiest sympathies. Our faith, and hope, and charities, have all been as one; and I shall go forth strong in your unfaltering strength. You will give inc your earnest prayers and blessings," she added in a quiv- ering tone, as a sweet smile lit up her moistened eyes; " and if wNe may not meet again on earth, why, surely, surely, we shall meet in heaven!" "You were ever hopeful and submissive, Annie. I remem- ber, not long since, when I stood with you 6ver the coffin of little Cora, how calm and even cheerful you were; and how I wondered to hear you say ' It is all right! '" "( And was it not, dearest Cora? If it is the will of God that we go forth upon a foreign mission, it was kind and just of limt to transplant my flower.. How so young a babe must have suffered from a long sea-voyage! It would be Imuch easier parting with the dear little babe of only a few weeks, than if it had been as many months, or years. True, it was hard to part with her, but God knew best; and I can see now, what I felt then, that it was all right." After a few moments' silence she resumed: "And now, girls, ag you have kindly offered to assist me, I will tell you what you may do. I had laid out some sewing, and was just trying to 6vereome a few scruples I had, and ask the privilege of having it done by the society; but, if you are willing to take it home, it will be a great deal better. It may be wrong for me to cherish such a feeling, but I would rather be indebted to your affection, than to the generosity or benevolence of all Cliftonville. Besides, some of the mem- bers are opposed to the movement; they do not feel as we   CARRIE   EMERSON.        289 do, and they might grudge the time, and feel that it might be more judiciously appropriated; or, at least, more satisfac- torily." (4 My dear Annie," said her husband, who had come in only in time to hear the last remark, " do not judge hastily or uneharitably; I have no doubt of their willingness to as- sist us, much as some of them disapprove of our going. It is only too much selfishness, mingled with their affection, which is blinding their eyes. If I were you, I would at least test them." Annie remembered the cloak, and a few similar scenes, when her sensitive nature-had been chilled by remarks, which those who made them, no doubt, at the time thought not only edifying, but serviceable in the extreme; and they might have been so at the proper time, and in the proper place; for when did ever reproof, or even advice, do all the good intended, spo- ken in public, or to be transferred through the lips of another? But Annie loved her husband too devotedly to let the slight- est jarring chord interpose, and she said, sweetly, "If you think best, Edwin, I'll get your flannels ready, and perhaps Jennie or Cora will ask Mrs. White if they can be done." "By all means, Annie; we love all the good people of Cliftonville, and must not show any partiality." There was a slight touch of rebellion in Jennie's nature, but she overcame it nobly, and resolved, if the work must bee carried there, she would be present with them, and if need be, fight the battles of her friends manfully, or rather, womanly; so she and Cora departed with hearts full of love tnd kindness to accomplish their undertaking. 1     290       CARRIE EMERSON. The society would not meet for two weeks; but Mrs. White promptly volunteered to call a special meeting, and it was arranged for the next day. There was a full and prompt attendance. To do them justice, all were anxious to show how much they loved and revered their faithful pastor; and, much as they might blame his gentle and devoted wife, their womanly sympathies were all enlisted in her behalf when they saw how faithfully she supported his cause; and many little valuable gifts were added to the stock that comprised their all of worldly goods. Mrs. Emerson's scruples were generously put aside, and she also joined the united endeavor. Scarcely a deprecating word was uttered, although the all-absorbing topic was the minister's departurc. All Annie Lee's short-comings were forgotten in Annie Spaulding's devoted love; and criticisms, that were not really criticisms (excuse the error, reader, if it be one), were mingled with the enumeration of her many sterling qualities, and high, earnest endeavors. "I declare, I never would have believed that Annie Lee would have made such a wife; would you?" "No, indeed! Many a time I've wondered, when she was first married, if it were not my duty to go in and give her a few useful hints about housekeeping (Jennie's lip curled scorn- fully), as her mother could not, with her large family, be ex- pected to teach her much, and Annie never left school until after poor Ellen. Grant died; but I found, by a little careful supervision, that my advice would be a superfluity - somehow she got along admirably without it." "So she did, Mrs. White! I was never more surprised,   CARRIE EMERSON.          291 than when brother Spaulding married her. To be sure, he had been acquainted with them jptimately a long time, and I suppose they were engaged long before we found it out; but he had only just entered the ministry, and his salary being rather small, and his way to make with the people, and Annie such a light-hearted, gay, merry little thing, that, I must own, I had many misgivings and forebodings for their future. If she had not been blessed with more than a common share of courage and patience, she would have given up when he was so prostrated by fever." "- And, then, who would have thought of her having so much talent! Did you know she was a contributor to one or two magazines, Mrs. Emerson?"  "I did. I knew, from reading some of her school compo- sitions, she had talent, and, in case of necessity, might avail herself of it." "O, Mrs. Emerson, I believe I have found you out!"-ex- claimed Cora Leavitt. "Annie told me that she was urged by a dear friend to try her hand at prose contributions for some periodical; and that, after the first attempt, she was warned by the same kind voice not to bury her talent; that it would surely be a dereliction from the path of duty; that the same beloved friend criticized, and taught her how to pre- pare her articles for the press;- and, if I am not very much  mistaken, it was you, Mrs. Emerson. Am I right?" "I did advise her, Cora; but let us speak of something else: it was only my duty." "' And has she really any talent, Mrs. Emerson?" said Mrs. Henderson. "1 I never troubled myself to read, much less to criticize, her pieces. I am not fond of reading; but when she brought out that little Sabbath school book, I declare I was     '92       CAR  I E EMERSO N. really provoked! Why, I think a person should have both years and experience in Arder to meet the wants of the rising generation; and, as Annie could boast of neither, I own I did my best to keep it out of our Sabbath school, at le]ast." "I But how could you condemn the work, if you had not even looked at it - especially when you knew circumstances had urged her to the expediency of publishing? I don't be- lieve Annie ever thought of aspiring to fame, in the very least degree; and her own sensitive nature would find 'n ugh to battle witl, witlhout opposition from professing fiiends." "I know all that, Mrs. Emerson; but, judging rom her nature, I tlought the product of her brain must be some sen- timental subject, clothed in flowery language; and such books are not quite the thing for young and tender minds. It would create a distaste for more solid reading, you know." "Young America has got some ways ahead of your theory, Mrs. Henderson!" said Jennie, with a slight touch of sar- casin in her tone. "My class, when they select a library book, invariably turn over the leaves, and, if it does not look what they term ' interesting,' they put it back, and keep on, patiently and perseveringly, to find one with the very charac- teristic you have denounced. In plain terms, if it is not written in a popular novel style, they don't want it; and, what's more, won't have it." "Is it so, Jennie? Well, I am both pained and surprised; and, as a maother, feel that something should be done to coun- teract such an influeice. If it did not originate in what I think I have justly condemned, I should be happy to be en- lightened as to how it did."   I CARRIE EMERSON.                 293 "The march of mind is onward, Mrs. Henderson," said Jennie, smiling. "I shouldn't wonder if they had already found out that the most sublime truths, as the most pointed and severe morals, are oftenest hidden or interwoven with the most flowery and fascinating language; not in the form of  light, trashy novels, but in the eloquent and soul-stirring sentiments that we all delight to hear, even from the pulpit." "I am afraid, Jennie, your sentiments are not exactly suited to your vocation as Sunday school teacher. Excuse me, dear; I know you mean well, and, for a young lady, are uncommonly conscientious; but, of course, you cannot be ex- pected to feel, as we mothers do, the necessity of keeping a strict watch over the rising generation." "I vote the mothers come themselves and teach their hope- ful progeny," said Jennie, good-naturedly. "I have often wondered why the task was left, sometimes, to very young girls. Not but that I, for one, delight in it ;- and, begging your pardon, Mrs. Henderson, I should be one of the very first to select my cousin Annie's book, as the very best thing to attract and engage their attention. I would add, for my justification, however, that I never recommend a book to my scholars until I have read it myself carefully. Annie's book is a version, touchingly and truthfully displayed, of her hus- band's early youth and orphanage; of his humility and de- pendence upon Him who had so bereaved and isolated him; of his upright and earnest endeavor to walk in the strait and narrow way; of his energy, and almost superhuman efforts to raise himself from almost abject poverty, to the ranks of those who make a classical education their proudest boast; and, finally,-when God had prospered him in all, his     294       CARRIE EMERSON. faithfulness to show, by his life and conversation, what man should be, in relation to his fellow-man, and to his Maker." "Is it possible, Jennie? And I have been so unjust as to condemn our dear young sister! How could I have been guilty of such a gross mistake?" "Well, I suppose it was easy enough to make. Authors, of course, must expect to be criticizer; and many a one, I have no doubt, does it, who only skims over the pages, just for the sake of finding fault." "Charity, charity, my dear Jennie!" said a voice, in an under-tone. "I am charitable, Mrs. Emerson! but I insist upon it that those who are incapable of improving a work should be cau- tious how they find fault with it. Many a time, a severe critic, upon perhaps a young author's first work, might find it a hard task to put together two chapters of good sound com- mon sense. Now, I am not personal, but such a thing has been done once or twice, to my certain knowledge; and, if I tell you it was not upon Annie's book, and that the said critic does not reside in Cliftonville, you must promise not to think me uncharitable, or even, what we all despise, a backbiter." "Only whole-souled, and guilty of a little more candor than has fallen to the lot of some of us!" said Mrs. Emerson. "I think, if we called it a fault, we should be uncharitable." "We are too apt to judge rashly, my dear Jennie," said Mrs. Henderson; "but some allowance should be made for our natural affection; we forget in our selfishness what is due to others. If I have wronged your cousin, you will forgive me. as I did it innocently." A scarcely perceptible smile flitted over Mrs. Emerson's J   CARRIE  EMERSON.        295 face; but, faint as it was, it did not escape Mrs. H. For a moment her haughty, turbulent spirit was aroused; but she quelled it instantly, and said, in her very softest tone: "I see you do not think it may be ascribed to innocence, Mrs. Emerson; may I have your candid opinion?" I  "Well, it seemed as if you had made a slight mistake," she answered, pleasantly. "I should have called it ignorance, as you were unacquainted with the work. If -I am wrong, pardon my candor." "O, I like your candor! I wish we all had strength to practise it more fully. I have, I believe, judged you wrongly, Mrs. Emerson. I did not understand you; but I hope we shall become better acquainted." "Just hear that!" whispered Lu. to Mary Eldrich. "I should n't wonder if, after all, Mrs. Emerson became a mem- ber of our society. Every one pays her such marked attention, I should think she 'd feel flattered." "If she does join," said Cora, who stood near, "there will have to be some remodelling here. I hope, for all our sakes, she will." "I thought, when Carrie married a rich husband, her mother would be looking down upon everybody; but I don't see the least change, do you?" "Pho! how ridiculous! I never thought of such a thing. She is too sensible for that." "Well, did n't you expect to see Mrs. Henderson flare up, just now, when she corrected her so coolly? I did." "No. Mrs. Henderson is a very haughty woman: but she feels that Mrs. Emerson's superiority never would be put     296       CARRIE EMERSON. down by haughtiness. Besides, I have no doubt that she is sincere, and would like to cultivate the acquaintance." "So would many others, Cora; but she is so proud, or shy, or distant, that somehow one can't get near her. I often think she must be lonely since Carrie left; but I don't like to call, lest she should think me intrusive; and, much as mother likes her, she seems to have the same feeling." "Strange! I never had any such fear. I can't imagine why it is." "There's one thing,- and I shall always regret it,- and that is Mrs. Buncombe's tattling. I think it is wholly on her account. She talked about them; and they, in turn, despise her. But she has left the place, and I am glad of it." (IIas she? Why, I thought I saw her with. you a day or two ago." "You did; but she only came out to spend the day. I wish she'd stay away. I don't wish to be shunned on her account." "bMrs. Emerson despises her, I thinlhbut I don't believe thatjs the reason she keeps you at such a distance. Depend upon it, 't is something more." "What can it be, then? I'm sure we always tried to be social and neighborly. You don't think she supposes we would stoop to backbiting, as Mrs. Buncombe does?" "Perhaps so. As long as you continue upon intimate terms with such a person, you must expect to be thought of the same class; and no injustice done, either. You'd say so of any one else." "But we are not intimate with her, Cora. We hate and despise her just as much as you or Mrs. Emerson."   CARRIE  EMERSON.        297 "Mrs. Emerson and myself do not hate any one, Lu. We despise the low, vulgar habit of tattling, or ridiculing; and, if we can't remedy, always avoid the evil. Mrs. Emerson tried hard, in her case; and, when she found it impossible, she lef her to her fate. Jennie and I followed a good example." "Well, we should like to do the same; but don't know how to go to work. You can't very well tell such a firebrand as she is that you don't want her." "You must first put out thefire!" said Cora, laughingly. "Sometimes you can say a very disagreeable thing in a very soft, agreeable way. Be candid and firm, but gentle at the same time; then, if she fly i!a passion, and call you hard names, it will not be your fault. "O, dear! I couldn't do it! She's so smooth and fair, there's no chance. We've all tried, in various ways; but she won't take; so we shall have to submit to the evil." "Perhaps you have all helped weave the web." "I suppose we have. And now tell me what you think of Mr. Spaulding's going to Burmah. Do. you think it right to take Annie so far away from all her friends? It's my opinion she 'll die before she gets half way there." "'God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb,' you know. Annie 's just as likely to live as her husband. To be sure, she looks delicate; but her spirit is strong and unfaltering. Besides, she believes it her duty to go; and duty never points but one way." "How her duty?- not to teach the heathen?" "Why not?  It may be her vocation." "Well, if teaching is her vocation, why can't she stay at     298       CARRIE EMERSON. home and teach? I don't doubt but she could find heathen this side the water; but I don't believe that's it. He's bent upon going, and she won't oppose him; that 's the way I look at it." "And is n't that her duty, just as much as teaching?" "Duty? No! If I had a husband, and he took it into his head to travel to Jericho, do you think I'd be such a fool as to go with him? I rather think not." "The case might be different. He has devoted himself, soul and body, to the service of his Master; and wherever He says go, he must be up and ready." "But how is he to know if it be his duty? We are very apt to deceive ourselves." TVe might; but he would not be likely to." "And why not, pray? He's only mortal, like the rest of us." "( Pardon me, Lu.- not just like the rest of us. He lives a life of self-sacrifice and devotion, leaning constantly upon his Saviour for support and direction. He is child-like in his con- fidence and trust; and, if you believe the Bible was given us through inspiration, why not believe that inspiration is leading him, and Annie also, to join a foreign mission?" "O, because we are a degenerate race, and God does not speak to us as he did to those of the olden time!" "And why not, Louisa?" said Mrs. Emerson, who had been attracted by the earnest voice and manner of both the young ladies. "Why not?" "Because," said Louisa, making room for her, gladly, " we are differently constituted, or organized, I suppose. We could   CARRIE EMERSON.          299 not understand, as they did, the will of God. Besides, we have the Scriptures for our guide." "( Yes; and they bid us go out into all the world, and spread them. Suppose every one should cling to home and kindred, where would be our missionaries?" ( Much good they do the heathen, Mrs. Emerson! I was reading, only yesterday, how indolent some of them were, and what luxuriant homes they possessed. I think a good deal of the money appropriated goes to pamper their appetites; and, if some of the tourists speak truth, they don't care half as much for the heathen as we do." "Just so we might say of our ministers. Now and then some one listens to a ' louder call,' and goes where pomp and fashion rule supreme. It would be very unjust were we to judge that all would do it, if the opportunity presented itself. Just so we might say of professors of religion, who, through their short-comings, throw a shade upon the cause they have pledged themselves to uphold. If you were a professing Christian, you would not like to be judged by such ones, would you?" "And so you think Mr. Spaulding inspired, do you?" "I would not know how else to explain it." "Do you think people are often inspired?" "Some minds are, I'm very sure; for instance, the poet. We may call it talent, or genius, or whatever else we please; but, if it were simply that, why can they not write at one time as well as another?" "I never knew but what they could." "Perhaps some of them can spin out verse, or string lines together in rhyme- what we call mechanical; but nature's     300       CARRIE EMERSO N. true poet has seasons when the pen and the brain are powerless. Again, when interested in some subject, the effect is electrical.- Thought after thought comes crowding the brain, clothed in beautiful, sublime, or flowery language, faster than the pen can indite them. If some unseen influence be not exerting itself upon the mind at such a time, I should like to know in what way you would account for it." "Such things are only for the gifted, in my opinion." "Whom do you call the gifted, Louisa?" "Why, the talented, of course. The poet, the artist, the orator, you know. ,Why enumerate them?" And why they in particular?" "O, because God has bestowed more upon them than upon us poor ordinary mortals!" "How do you know that he has, Louisa? You see," she added, gently, "I 'm getting you into rather close quarters." "Never mind, Mrs. Emerson. I acknowledge you are more talented than I am; so I '1 submit!  "How do you know that, Louisa?" "Why, you can write; you're a poet! You can't deny it." "I have no wish to deny it; and, while I acknowledge and bless God for my gift, why can you not do the same?" "He! I should be proud enough, if I thought I had any to be thankful for!" "Why, you don't mean to say that God has withheld from you what he has given every one else! You must have one, at least; and, if it has hitherto lain dormant, or been ' laid up in a napkin,' it is time you brought it to light, and im- proved it. To some are given ten, to some five; but to every   CARRIE EMERSON.          301' living, breathing creature, one'; and you know, Louisa, we on." "What if we do not know what our talent is? "We must let circumstances, as in the case of our dear young friend, bring it to light, and help develop it fully. In spite of sneers or fears, she went to work pereveringly, and she succeeded nobly. And now, having tested her power in one sense, she feels more competent to the task she is about to enter upon, and I have no doubt will do all the good her most sanguine hopes lead her to believe she will. Is she not a noble-minded, lovely woman?" "Yes she is!" said almost every one; and Mrs. White added, l"I did not think her early youth gave promise of any- thing uncommon." "I did," said Mrs. Emerson; "when she was quite a child traits used to flash out at times like bright jewels, and I felt that her destiny would be no common one." "Do you believe the natural character has anything to do with destiny?" "Most assuredly I do. You never see a dull, common- place, mediocre mind aspiring to, anything above the common beaten track. Your child of destiny is undoubtedly the child of genius. If Napoleon Bonaparte had not nursed his wild ambition, would it have towered over such a mighty space? Ambition led him onward. God made him a scourge; it was his destiny; he believed it himself. Genius or talent might have seated him upon the highest pinnacle of human glory; his overpowering ambition ruined him." "But, Mrs. Emerson, if writing is Mrs. Spaulding's talent, 26     302       CARRIE EMERSON. and it is her duty to improve it, how can you reconcile it with her going to Burmah? It will do no good there." "There are many ways of improving it, Louisa, that per- haps you little dream of. She may write for her own special pleasure, using up all the little odds and ends of time that might otherwise hang heavily. You do not suppose that such people always give the effusions of the brain, or the produc- tions of the pen, to the public? Or, in case her time became so occupied that she must suppress thoughts, and stern neces- sity forbids her giving them utterance, think you their over- flow will not pervade and beautify her nature, and add to all the softer attributes of woman a holier charm? And if she cherish well the gift, even in such a way as this, think you it will not lift her above all the ordinary cares which so clog and sometimes embitter our daily life?" "I always knew you enjoyed more than a common share of happiness, Mrs. Emerson," said Louisa. "I begin to compre- hend why it is so. I'll be candid, and own that I always thought you romantic and pedantic, and have often pitied you, for I looked upon it actually as a misfortune. I hope you 'll pardon me." "Certainly, Louisa; and, Mary, is that the way you also have regarded and commiserated me?" "Pretty much. I am no great lover of literature (you see I'm growing candid, too); and whenever I have seen you occupied with your pen, or your books, I wondered how you could reconcile it to your conscience, the spending so much precious time. I knew you never neglected your children, or your household; and that was a mystery, as we often hear people say, that, when a woman takes up the pen, she must   CARRIE EMERSON.          303 lay down the distaff; still, I could not comprehend how any one could draw pleasure from such a source, equivalent to many things they must forego." "As the bee sucks honey, Mary. Did you ever feel that even the little wayside flower we trample beneath our feet was competent to furnish thoughts beautiful and sublime, if we examine them with an eye to their beauty and finish? that They speak, in love's own language, Of the Hand whose wondrous power Siif      tIzHas folded up a lesson In the heart of every flower; And has written, with His finger, On every fading leaf, That the fragile lives they come to bless Are oftentimes as brief.' "And do you know that if I ever arrive at fame as an au- thor, or succeed in improving the gift God has implanted in my nature, I shall owe much of it to the wild, picturesque beauty of your native village? I have heard it hinted that I spent too much time roaming through these magnificent old groves and woods; that I was a dreamer, sitting upon rocks and cliffs; but'it made no difference to me. Like Bernard Barton, I could say, ( Perhaps I see beauty where you do not.' But, if you think I do not love society, and to mingle with the world, you have mistaken me, sadly." "I had an idea you rather avoided, than courted, society." "Perhaps I have, at times, where I did not find congenial- ity; but, generally speaking, as I said before, 'as the bee sucks honey,' we may find something to interest us, at every turn."     304       CARRIEI EMERSON. "Well, I must say that I have enjoyed myself better than at any previous meeting. I must thank you, Mrs. Emerson, for a good share of it." ( "Not me, Louisa," she said, softly, as she moved away, "but lim who has tuned our hearts to beat, perhaps, in unison." "II believe she's a Christian," said Mary, in a low tone, "if she don't belong to our church." \ .   CHAPTER      XXIII.

"I'M worried to death about our Tom!" said good Mrs. Eldrich, I( worried to death!" "Why, what ails Tom, mother? I don't see but he's well enough." "I-He's well enough, Loiza, as to bodily health, but I do really believe that good-for-nothing creature of a Miss Bun- combe 's getting up a match between him and that brazen girl she's so intimate with - that Cameron girl." 26*     306       CARRIE  EMERSON. "For pity's sake, is n't Tom old enough to look out for himself? I 'll risk him anywhere." "But I won't, Loiza. I know there 's something afloat, and I wish you 'd try and ferret it out." "I shall do no such thing, mother! I guess Ton would n't tlhank me folr neddling in his affairs. If he is such a ninny as to flirt with Allie Cameron, I hope he'll get paid for it. But I shan't meddle!" "If he does," said Mary, "the consequence will, I'm afraid, be a sister-in-law we shall be anything but proud of. She can act the lady, I know, to perfection; but when she throws off the mask, she's anything but a lady." "Well, how do you think we are going to prevent it? You know Tom 's wilful, and, if we oppose him, he 'll be sure to do sonie silly thing; the only way is to let him do as he pleases." "He shain't have her that's flat," said the old lady, get- ting angry. "I won't have her in my family! I can't endure her, no how " "Nor I either, mother," said Mary. "I used to like her well enough, when I first got acquainted with her; but she don't wear well. To hear Mrs. Buncombe talk, any one would think her perfection." "Whathats opened your eyes, mother? I guess it's only im lri lnation." "I guess it a'n't, then! I found a scrap of a note on Tom's table, this morning, and he 's had an invitation up there; and he 'll go, or I'm mistaken." "Do let him go, mother; you can't help it, and you are not sure it's she, after all."   CARRIE EMERSON.          307 "Well, if it is n't she, it's that ugly looking sister of hers, and that's worse yet; she 's perfectly disgusting! O dear! I wish you'd go and make Susan Hammett a visit, Loiza, and reconnoitre a little; you'd soon find out. You might just call on Mrs. Buncombe; it would do no harm, you know." "I shan't do it, mother! I've made a firm resolution to have no more to do with her; and I 'm not going to break it for a trifle. If you think Tom is n't capable of taking care of himself, he'd better have a guardian." "I should think you'd feel interested yourself, Loiza; he's all the brother you've got." "Well, I don't wish to injure myself in trying to save him. He's always getting into some silly scrape. I wish he had stayed at California!" "I 'll go, mother, if Lu. don't want to; I'm not afraid of contamination. I'm older than Lu., and all I've got to say is, if Tom gets ahead of me, he 'll have to get up early in the morning." "Well, Mary, he can get up 'mazing early, sometimes, when he gets a new kink in his head; and all I hope is, you 'll get the start of him." Tom was lying upon the green bank, in the cool shade, di- rectly under the little parlor window, quietly reading. He listened intently a few moments; then the merry mischief be- gan to sparkle in his eyeftnd, springing up, he came in as suddenly upon the trio, as some half-formed resolve had come upon him. "Mother!" he exclaimed, marching up before the looking- glass, and surveying himself with an air of perfect self-satis- faction, brushing his enormous whiskers, and twirling his     308       CARRIE  EMERSON. moustache; "I want my best white Marseilles vest, and new white cravat, done up in tip-top style. I'm off to-morrow!" The old lady looked aghast. "Do, dear Tom, tell me where you're bound, and what you're up to!" "I'm going to the city of notions; don't know but I shall commit mlatrimlony before I get back." "Going to make a fool of yourself; hey, Tom?" "Don t know about that, Molly. Please put the shoe on the other foot - going to make one of somebody else - won't that suit you better?" "I ould n't go," said Lu., gently. "Ma' is n't very well, ; and it's some trouble to get your things done nicely, at such short notice; besides, we want you to carry us to Egypt." I "Egypt! Pretty name, that, to be hitched on to the fag  end of old Cliftonville's next neighbor! Delightful place'! all rocks and swamps! Why, Hump Hollow, that we hear  of occasionally, would be more appropriate, if not as poetical. Egrypt, forsooth! Why, it must have been the last place  madec; and, Saturday night, after all the rest of the work was  done, they tossed all the rocks and rubbish in one grand heap, : and then left it to coax what vegetation was possible into the midst. Egypt! I wonder if that's what the pilgrim fathers called it; and whether it was complimentary, or because they were hard up for a name just then!" "They 've got a Sodom and G(dhorrah, too,-queer names enough. Your old flame, Serena Gates, lives there; and we want to make her a visit, but can't, unless you take us, as there's no regular coach conveyance."  "Shouldn't think there would be! Ia! ha! Well, if Serena has found her way to Sodom, no wonder she has le1   CARRIE  E MERSON.        309 all the gates behind her! But I shan't follow her; as the fellow said, 'I 've bought my ticket for another place.' I al- ways had an idea that the road to Sodom was ruinous And, as mother is not very well, you just busy yourself about my fixins. I should think you'd like to save her the trouble." "But, my son, I don't wish you to go! I'm afeard you 've taken a fancy to that Cameron girl; and I do wish you'd keep away from her." "Why, mother, she's a tip-top girl -has any amount of beaux! Don't fidget yourself about me; like as not she won't look at me; it's according to who's hanging round her now. I shall ask her out to ride,- pop the question. If she says yes, and holds her mind long enough, I'll take her to the parson's, perhaps. If she says no, you look out for me, Molly; I may jump out of a four-story window, or go hang myself  Such things have happened, you know." "I shan't be there, Tom; I scorn such people." "'Not going?" said Tom, musingly. " O, I guess I dreamed it! I had an idea that you were going, to take care of me." "I have a great mind," said Mary, innocently, " to go and see the Hammett girls. I 've promised them this long while." "Do, I entreat you; and, mother dear, don't worry about me. You know I 'll be safe while Molly's round." "Well," said Mrs. Eldrich, drawing a long breath, by way of partial relief, " all I hope is, that Miss Cameron has got some one she likes better; but, allowing she has, she'll take up with your invite. She shows no partiality when an oppor- tunity offers to go out to ride, or to a ball-just as lief have a married beau as a single one." "O, mother, that's scandal, any way!"     310       CARRIE EMERSON. "No such thing, master Tom; 't is the living truth. The other day she went to ride with a Mr. Olfactory, or Nothank- you, or some such heathenish name; and the hotef where they stopped was brimful of company, and one young lady hap- pened to know miss Allie's beau. He asked her to take a scat il his carriage, as there was plenty of room; but she answered him rather scornfully, and told him he 'd look better inviting his wife. 'T is gospel truth, Tom - came right from the bountain-head; and I don't doubt it a bit."  "O, mother, I know you're only joking; but, rest assured,  if she takes up with my offer, I shall put a veto upon all such  proceedinogs! I'll teach her to say 'No, thank you,' to both  married and single. But I don't believe it." "Mrs. Thayer did n't believe it, either. She said it was'  wicked for people to talk as they did. She knew they were  wild and careless; but there were so many things to be taken $ into consideration. She had never seen anything out of the way; her husband thought a great deal of them; and their   t father was such a nice man--just as if he'd allow of any    I misconduct! Well, she called there one day, and, after she took her leave, she found she'd forgotten her parasol, and she went back to get it. She ran up stairs, softly, not wishing to disturb any one, opened the parlor door, and there sat her  husband in the large rocking-chair, and Miss Allie quietly seated upon his knee, her arm around his neck, and her face close to his (to be sure she was what you might call a child, only sixteen, so she said); and, do you believe, they neither of them started! Mrs. Thayer walked quietly across the room, took her parasol from the piano, and left without a word. What they said, or thought, I don't know. She took   CARRIE  EMERSON.        3" it very philosophically, as Mrs. Emerson would say; and, in- stead of flying into a passion, left it to the future, knowing that justice, if slow, is sure; and I 've no doubt but they 'll get richly paid." "Pshaw! Somebody got that up for the sake of the scan- dal; it is n't likely it is true." , "I tell you, Tom, it is gospel truth. Mrs. Thayer told me  of it herself; and she always speaks truth. She wouldn't have mentioned it, but she thought Mary and Loiza were getting drawn into the snare; and it was kind of her, any way." ( If it had been me," said Mary, "I should have requested the pleasure of my husband's company home; and then, for his especial benefit, I should havem4dministered a good smart dose of' Caudle lecture!' I would n't care whether it agreed with him or not." "4 And if it had been me," said Lu., "I 'd have gone right straight to her father, and told the whole story. It's a shame he does n't know how they behave!" "And I insist upon it," said Tom, " that from this time, henceforth and forever, you don't bring any more such scan- dalous stories, to blight the reputation of my lady-love. Why, you 'll drive me to distraction; and, instead of white vest and kids to match, I shall want a strait-jacket! And now, mother mine, if I ever should bring her home here, as my  lawful wedded wife, you'll receive her cordially, won't you?" "No, Tom! I 'll shut the door in her face! I 'll let you know that I won't have any such baggage here!" "Well, you 'll get my baggage ready; as I want to go in the second train."     312       CARRIE EMERSON. "She 'll train you; and I hope to goodness she will!" "I don't care if she does! She shan't train round with married men after she's mine; that's positive, mother."  i "Ie is n't in earnest, I do believe." "Yes, he is, Loiza; just as sober as a deacon! I don't care how soon he takes a wife, if he 'll only make a good choice. Strange, when there's so many pretty and good girls in town, that he must go dancing after her! It seems as if the very old Harry was in him!"              I "You leave it to me- he shan't have her while my name's Mary Eldrich!"  "I hope, if that's all, you won't change it in a hurry. I'd rather have a whole tribe of old maids in the family, than one daughter-in-law I should be ashamed of." At nine o' clock, Mary and her brother took their seats in the cars; and, in due time, were chatting merrily with Sue and Lina Hammett. I 'm so glad you came!" said Sue; " we are going to a picnic this afternoon. You 'll enjoy it, I know. It's only about six miles from here; just a pretty ride." "I've got a call to make," said Tom. "I 'll be back by dinner-time. Good-morning." "And I 've got a call to make, and I dread it," said Mary. "Where, pray?" "At Mrs. Buncombe's." "Mrs. Buncombe's? I was in hopes, when she left your neighborhood, you'd drop her acquaintance." "I should be glad to; but there are some good reasons why I cannot. Do you see anything of her?" "Yes, we meet her occasionally; but, of course, we don't   CARR-IE EMERSON.          313 know her. That's one of the advantages of city life. I 've met her once or twice with those Camerons-how   they behave!  ridiculous!" "How, pray?" "Why, talking loud, giving every one they meet a broad stare, attracting universal attention; gaudily dressed, too,- especially the youngest one. She has the boldest face I ever saw; and I presume she thinks herself handsome. I wouldn't call, if I were you." "I must; I have a particular reason."i "Well, if they should happen to be at the picnic, you won't bring us in contact with them. We have to be very particular whom we associate with. A reputation is too much to lose, you know." After dinner, they rode out to the grove; and, in strolling through the woods, they came upon a little group who were sitting apart, having a social chat. Tom left abruptly, and joined the strangers. "'Tis Mrs. Buncombe," said Lina. "Susy and I will walk on, if you wish to speak to her." They passed on; and Mrs. Buncombe came forward, her black eyes sparkling with pleasure. "Why Mary! how delighted I am   to see you!- and here's my friend Allie. O, your brother has monopolized her already! She'll be delighted to see you--you can't imagine how much she thinks of you all!" Her volubility spared poor Mary the insincerity needful to keep up appearances; and she allowed herself to be guided back a few paces, where sat her brother, making a stren- 27     314e CARRIE E MESON.  uous effort to render himself agreeable - Mary thought, ridiculous. Miss Cameron arose, and, with an air and manner perfectly  lady-like, greeted Miss Eldrich, and then resumed her seat  upon the grassy knoll beside her sister and Tom. Mary's lip curled as she listened to her brother's nonsensi- cal rattle; and she thought, with the Quaker, 'that, if his brain was overburdened with such paltry stuff, the sooner he got rid of it the better.' Bjut, if Tom provoked her, the calm, self-possessed manner of Miss Cameron did much towards softening her resentment. Every trace of hoydenism was put aside, and she answered modestly, and even naively, all his flattering questions, until Mary was half inclined to believe that even her own eyes and ears had been guilty of base and barefaced scandal.  After a few brief words of excuse, and a promise to call,  she left them, and rejoined the Hammetts. It was a beautiful afternoon, and Mary was just in the mood to enjoy it; so, putting off for the time the responsi- bility of her guardian-angelship, she left Tom to his wayward fate, and gave herself up to the pleasure of pleasing and being  pleased. With the assistance of the delighted Mrs. Buncombe, Tom  made rapid strides in the road to matrimony. Mrs. B. had a motive for wishing her dear friend safely noosed. She sometimes imagined that her better half was trying to see the reflection of his handsome face in those calm, pale blue, liquid eyes; and she could n't afford to have him prove recreant at present. She knew it was her own fault, in bringing them so often together; and she meant to remedy   CARRIE EMERSON.          815 the evil, even if it were at the expense of another. When the company dispersed, she invited her young friends home to spend the evening, and then she commissioned Tom to see them safely home. Heigh ho, Tom! you are getting along swim- mingly! I should n't wonder, - but I guess I'd better not anticipate. Mary's social enjoyment was unalloyed. Lucy Eldrich was on a visit in the neighborhood, and she came at their request and spent the evening, and before they said 'good-night,' Mary had whispered the purport of her mission, and Lucy had pleaded so earnestly for a share in Mary's self-imposed task, that it was agreed upon, and Lucy was to come next morning, and accompany her to Mrs. Buncombe's. Mrs. Buncombe was in the highest spirits. If there was any one thing she delighted in more than another, setting aside backbiting, it was match-making; and, having got ev- erything in proper order, just as if she might not anticipate a little. "Your brother has improved wonderfully, Mary. I con- gratulate you truly! I wish I had such an one; I should be so proud of him! Noble-looking, too; and so sensible! I declare, if I was n't married, I 'd set my cap at once. It's just as well, perhaps; I see he has taken a violent fancy to my friend Allie, and she '1 make him just the most perfect little wife imaginable. I suppose you see he 's quite fascin- ated; and no wonder; she 's one of the most bewitching little things I ever knew; don't you tink so?" pausing to take breath.  The color mounted to the forehead of poor Mary. For     316       CARRIE EMERSON. once in her life she was at a loss for an answer. Lucy came promptly to her aid. "Pho! Ton 's too young to think of matrimony these seven years; and, before the expiration of that term, he has my sincere good wisles that Miss Cameron be either out of the market, or out of the country, I don't care which. I should n't fancy her for a cousin by any means." "Too young!" exclaimed Mrs. Buncombe, who in her as- tonishment had lost the conclusion of the sentence. "Too young! good gracious! Mr. Eldrich is all of four-and- twenty! do you call that too young?" "Decidedly!" said Lucy, in a provoking drawling tone. "I would n't have him think seriously of matrimony a day before he's thirty; it will be full as soon as he will be capa- ble of taking care of himself, let alone a wife." "He has come to years of discretion, I should hope," re- torted Mrs. Buncombe, her black eyes flashing. "I don't know," said Lucy, in the same provoking tone. "Moses didn't arrive at years of discretion until he was forty; and he was a much better man than my cousin Tom!" *   "Moses who?" said Mrs. Buncombc, angrily. "I have not the honor of his acquaintance." "I presume not; neither have I, only historically." "Well, I suppose he had another name, hadn't he? I may possibly have seen it, although I 'm no book-worm." "No; in his country I believe they thought one name suf- ficient; so they simply called him Moses." "Well, I should have called him a confounded old fool, if it took him all that time to arrive at years of discretion!" Mary looked shocked, and Lucy's face grew some inches   CARRIE EMERSON.          317 longer in the eyes of the indignant Mrs. Buncombe. But of the identity or origin of Moses she was as much in the dark as ever. She wished in her soul she was a reader. Tom was, however, and-she resolved to ask him. "Do you miss me at Cliftonville, Mary? It's a hateful place!" Another poser for Mary; but she got over it by taking up the gauntlet in behalf of her native village. "How can you say so, when you know I love it so dearly? Why, I could n't live in the city more than a week; the dust and noise would kill me." "You 've lost quite a number of town's people, lately ;--no great loss, either," hastening to correct herself. "I think it is," said Lucy; " what I call all the cream." "I should prefer the skim-milk, if you call Carrie Emerson and Ed. Ashley the cream." "We are going to lose Mr. and Mrs. Spaulding soon." "I 'm glad of it! He's altogether too good, and she's a good-for-nothing little simpleton! I don't fancy either of them." "I 'm very sure we shall never have their equals!" said Mary, somewhat shortly. "I wish you'd stay and spend the day with me, Mary; I expect your brother and his lady-love soon. I think you ought to cultivate the acquaintance; it would be pleasanter all round." Poor Mary! better feelings had of late been stirring in her bosom; some of her bitter prejudices had vanished the day before, and somehow her organ of benevolence was enlarg- 27*     318       CARRIE EMERSON.  ing. Lucy caught the wavering expression upon her counte- nance, and came again to the rescue. "Don't urge her, Mrs. Buncombe; wait until Tom has signalized himself manfully, by bearing off the prize from half a dozen moon-struck danglers. If there should chance to be war in the camp, and Tom should beat a precipitate retreat, he 'd feel bad enough, without having to encounter her sisterly  sympathy." "I don't believe he'd get much from you, Miss Lucy, whatever else he might get," "That's a fact, Mrs. Buncombe! 'Tis a commodity quite too precious to be squandered in such an idle matter; but if Tom will agree to wait until he 's thirty, and I find he needs it, I 'll insure him a double portion."  Mrs. Buncombe affected to laugh at the idea, but in her heart she vowed vengeance against her tormentor. If it were possible, and it looked easy enough, she'd put enmity between Tom and his very affectionate cousin.  "And so you won't meet your future sister-in-law?" "I think not, Mrs. Buncombe.  I promised the girls I  would not stay long," and she rose to go. Mrs. B. did not  even pass the compliment of' Call again' to Lucy, and there- by saved herself another mortifying rebuke or rebuff. "I hate that prim cousin of yours!" she said, an hour afterwards, to Tom Eldrich. ( If I were you, I would n't own her! She takes quite too much interest in your affairs, I think." "The devil she does, Mrs. Buncombe! Well, I shall put a veto on that at once. Lucy is a good girl, and we all think a great deal of her; but I guess I can take care of my affairs   CARRIE EMERSON.          319 without any of her assistance. If I needed any," he added, with a low bow, "I should certainly call upon you; as I know you are not troubled with scrupulousness." "Thank you, Mr. Eldrich. I knew you could not doubt my friendship. I think, oftentimes, relations are nothing but a bore. Ha! ha! if you think yourself so capable, it's more than bliss Lucy does; and, by the way, I want to know who Moses is? --some great traveller or philosopher, whom she thinks a model for you. But if I were you, I'd let her know I could make my own way in the-world; I would n't have her tell me to take pattern by Moses, or any other modern hero." "Modern with a vengeance!" and Tom gave way to an uncontrollable burst of laughter. "Why can't you find me a model, Mrs. Bticombe? Moses is altogether too antiquated." The identity of Moses flashed upon her like lightning. Her cheek flushed crimson, and the light in her eyes was perfectly scorching. Her first angry impulse was a quarrelsome one; but a little twinge of his presence, whose green eyes had in- fused some of their poison into her system, and a gentle ring of the door-bell, admonished her, and gave her time to quell the rising tempest. It was as she thought, her friend Allie; and, what with certain little flattering attentions, and sundry little hints and playful allusions, meant to mystify Tom, she managed to keep him within civility's boundaries, and herself out of the reach of his impertinence-sometimes she thought it cool impudence. Miss Allie played her part to perfection, and Tom began to wonder within himself if it were not his duty to enlighten the dear little unsophisticated thing as. to the true character- of her bosom friend.     320       CARRIE EMERSON. He began to like her, too, passing well; mind, I said like.  It would be a desecration of the word to call it love. They understood neither the definition of the word, nor the senti- ment; there was no chance, either, of their getting into such a strange channel; she was too hackneyed, and he was too heartless; and Mrs. Buncombe would never have been ihil- anthropic enough to endeavor to awaken anything of the kind  in their natures, if selfishness had not predominated over her small bump of benevolence. Well, the hours flitted by, and if fate did not have anything to do with the flirtation, folly did. Tom offered himself, and was acce)ted. IIappy Tom!  Iow do you know he was' happy Tom? If you think so, clear reader, let me tell you   . it is a gross mistake. Tom felt as cheap as if he had stolen a sheep. Somehow, all the time his evil genius was leading him on, a little sprite kept whispering, "She 'll say no, never  fear, Tom!" lie did n't want her any more than any other tom-fool who had played around her like a satellite, and he really thought he should step off some fine morning, if he had to go  to Australia, or to the Tongo Islands. "Devil take it!" soliloquized the poor fellow. "Here 's a fix! But I 'm in for it now, and there's no help. Isn't there though? I 'll do the devoted a day or two, get Mrs. B. to help me raise some kind of a breeze, and then, hurrah for Cliftonville! She shan't see my heels for dust. I wouldn't marry her if she were worth her weight in good old solid gold! I'll have no trifling, however, while the illusion or delusion lasts; which is it, I wonder?" "You must have your daguerreotype taken, Mr. Eldrich,   CARRIE EM ERSON.         821 V before you return home," said Miss Cameron, as they sat alone in the cosey back parlor. "What for, Alicia?" "Why, I want it, of course." "To enumerate amongst your other trophies, hey? Your friend enlightened me, some months ago, concerning your wicked propensity of cutting up hearts. I declare," he mur- mured, rolling up his eyes, and trying to look killing, " it pierced me to the very soul; and now I am running the fear- ful risk of being the next one!" "Pho! no danger; cousins, you know; they shouldn't indulge in such foolish fancies, should they?" "But, look here! whose daguerreotype is this?" taking a small locket from her neck, and looking at it quizzingly. That's my cousin, Mr. Eldrich." "Well, you will oblige me by wearing his in your pocket, when you get mine. They would n't agree together no how. I 've no idea of-sharing my privileges with any one; so, if he is satisfied with half a heart, it is more than I can be." "Certainly you do not doubt me?" Two days afterwards, Tom was seated again in the cosey back parlor, talking rapidly, pouring any amount of senti- mental nonsense into the ears of his devoted lady-love, when he was startled by a child's shrill scream, that came up from a lower room. A squabble followed three or four hard slaps upon the shoulders of the miserable little offender; and then the coarse voice of the second sister, Henrietta, poured forth a whole volley of invectives and bitter upbraidings; the young one had carelessly broken a pitcher. Miss Cameron sprang down stairs to quell the tumult, and     322       CARRIE EMERSON. Tom Eldrich made tracks for the front door. The bond was broken; he was free!"(Iurrah for Cliftonville!" said our hero, in a low tone, but energetic for all that, as he bolted into a crowdcd omnibus. As he did not, just then, require the benefit of Mary's sympathy, he said not a word,-did not even see her again,--but took the next downward train, and, at the end of two hours, was safely ensconced in his own little back parlor, housed and sheltered from tumult and hum- bug; and, as he expressed it, feeling like a new man. Mary waited a day or two before she should act upon her responsibility as delegate; but, not seeing or hearing from him in all that time, she grew uneasy, and made another call upon Mrs. Buncombe. But it was of no kind of use - Miss Cameron wouldn't, and Mrs. Buncombe couldn't, tell; and, sadly at loss, fearing she knew not what, she persuaded Lucy to cut short her visitnd go home with her. To her infinite relief, she met her brother on her way from the depot to her home. He winced a little under the self- imposed task; nevertheless, it must be done; so he proceeded to extract a promise from Mary and Lucy (how sincerely did he wish Lucy just then a thousand miles off!), that they would never breathe a word of how he had enjoyed or employed his time. ("And what of your decamping so suddenly, Thomas?" Lucy never called him Thomas, only when she was in an earnest, serious mood; and there was, he well knew, no dodg- ing her then. "Did she jilt you, cousin Thomas?" Tom's temper was up like a flash. "No, I '1 be hanged if she did, Lucy! In justice to myself, I must tell you the truth," he added rapidly. "Your woman's curiosity will never   CARRI E EMERSON.          323 let me rest, if I don't; and, after that, mum's the word. Welil you see, girls, there was 'trouble down below,' as the sailors say; and such language as came from the lips of that sister of hers I'll bet you never heard in all your life! I never did; and I 've travelled some in my day. Alicia went down to hush the vixen; but it only made a bad matter worse. Henrietta swore; and then I heard some very coarse expres- sions, by way of rejoinder, which astonished me all the more, as I had just been listening to some dulcet tones, from those very lips, so soft and sweet that they almost entranced me;- and then the fingers, that had touched the piano keys so lightly as scarcely to elicit an accompaniment to the foregoing fairy- like music, caught hold of a poor little trembling sister, and shook her' so violently that I had half a mind to rush into the domestic melee, and take the child's part. Another flourish followed; and, acting up to an ancient rule, I took my exit suddenly, inwardly promising never to call again." "But I'm sorry you were so hasty in making her an offer. Won't it be a breach-of-promise case?" "No; I rather think it will be a bridge-of-promise case  However, if I get summoned, you shall be present, and hear me give the foregoing description in rainbow colors. And I 'm not the only one who has fled in like dismay. I can find plenty to corroborate my statement. Can't you congratulate me upon my escape from such a hornet's nest?" "Did you say that young thing used profane language, cousin Tom?" "Yes, Lucy- swore like an Algerine pirate! Bah! I 'm ashamed to think of it."     324       CARRIE- EMERSON. "Poor things! how I pity them! How do you account for such a state of things?" "O, easy enouh!" said Mary. "They lost their mother when they were very young. Their father lavished all that was in his power upon them; but it seems he was not careful enough in scrutinizing the company they kept. By degrees, they came to deceive him shamefully; and, many a time, when he thought them all quietly housed, they were here and there, and everywhere; or else had a house full of company,-wild, unprincipled young gentlemen,--for they'd pass anywhere for gentlemen, in broad daylight, I suppose; and, being naturally lively and high-spirited, they have been led on, step by step, until they have arrived to what we see." "And what will be the end, I wonder?" Heaven only knows, Lucy! Perhaps, if they were fortu- nate enough to secure good, likely men for husbands, they might do well, yet. They are very capable, so Mrs. Thayer says; but who, for pity's sake, would be willing to run the risk? There's many a one would encourage their conduct,- yes, lead them into all sorts of extravagances,- who would shrink from being allied to them, as they would from the plague. A man of sense would prefer a shrew, or a prude; in short, anything but such as they." "Well, I 'm clear," said Tom, "thanks to my lucky star! and, if I were on the summit of Sunset Rock, I'd give three cheers for old Cliftonville, and its pretty, modest girls! After all, there's no mistake in the country being the best place to look for a wife." "Nonsense! Don't go upon another extreme. You might search our good old city from end to end,-yes, sift it thor-   CARRIE EMERSON.          325 oughly,--and yo0 wouldn't find their counterpart oftener than one in a thousand." "You don't believe it, Lucy!" "Yes, I do--setting aside the openly depraved, and only seeking out the deceptive." O, you're a country girl, Lucy; you are unsophisticated!" "T Thank you, Tom! - and what you can't set down to that account, please call charity." "If M3rs. Emerson were here,- she would think it our duty to try to enlighten and save them." "No, she would n't, either She knows well what they are, and that it would be worse than labor wasted. According to her theory, the finger of duty never points but one way. Now, if we did feel it a duty, and, at the same time, felt utterly pow- erless to perform it, it seems to me we should shrink from the risk of contamination, and pass on, leaving itito a higher power, and a stronger instrument. Tom did perfectly right, in my opinion. The lesson will not be lost upon him; and, if, as I more than half suspect, a wicked or mischievous pro- pensity led him to take the part he has enacted with, it seems, so much satisfaction to himself and you, I hope there is still enough good left to show him his error, and help him to profit by it." "And you won't expose me?" "Positively not. Mrs. Buncombe will, though, next time she pays you a visit." "She won't come again," said Mary. "I did all I could to make her understand that we were sick of her; and, as there's no one else she visits here, I think we are rid of her. I hope so, heartily." 28     326       CARRIE  EM1ERSON. "Do, dear, tell me how you made out, Mary! Is Tom paying attention to that flighty thing, or not?" "No, indeed, mother; we had all our fears for nothing. I had a grand time; and persuaded cousin Lucy to come home with me." "I'm so thankful, Mary!. I don't care how soon Tom gets married, if he only gets a good wife." "Come, girls," said Tom, a week afterwards, " get ready, and I 'll take you to Egypt. I don't care if it is the jump- ing-off place! I feel perfectly satisfied with Egypt, and even Sodom, taken in contrast with some other places I  know of."  While they were riding leisurely- over the white, shining strip of beach that made one part of the way delightful, Mrs. Buncombe was spinning along, at a rapid rate, on her way to Cliftonville. She felt the need of change, and the cool sea- breeze of Cliftonville was so invigorating! Moreover, she had made the discovery of the demolition of the airy castle she had helped Tom Eldrich build; and, if it had not reached his native village, why, she meant it should. The carriage had scarcely been gone from the door five minutes, when, in all the glory of a new plaid silk, and a stylish white bonnet, Mrs. Buncombe burst upon the old lady's vision. What was to be done? If it had been a rattlesnake, now, she would have caught the poker or tongs, and attacked it vigorously, and, most likely, come off victorious. Or, if it had been a beetle-bug, or a hum-bug, the old lady would soon have brushed the intruders down, and trampled them under   CARRIE EMERSON.          327 foot; for, though the poor buzzing insects were harmless, only as far as buzzing was concerned, still, they were stigmatized, by Mrs. Eldrich, as good-for-nothing, noisy creatures, and she could n't endure them. But here was a humbug of altogether another description; and, although still less a favorite than the other, was not easily brushed out, or knocked down. No, indeed, Mrs. El- drich! - and, while the good old lady is rallying, the enemy has passed the outposts, divested herself of bonnet and man- tilla, and, comfortably settling herself in the best rocking- chair, declared her intention of spending the whole of the long day with her dear Mrs. Eldrich. It made small difference that "the young folks were absent, and would not be home till night;" that Mrs. Eldrich " had a bad cold, and must be excused from talking," etc. She had come with a budget brimful of all sorts of spiteful innuendoes, and she had n't the slightest idea of taking it back with her. So, all in good time, Mrs. Eldrich was in full possession of Tom's well-guarded secret; and what was added by way of seasoning left an indefinite fear, in the mother's bosom, that her darling only son had been guilty of more misdemeanors than her garrulous neighbor liked to tell; and, as the old lade muttered to herself, when she was out getting tea, " the Lord knows, she's none too scrupulous!" In spite of her previous resolution to go nowhere else, she took her leave early enough to make one or two calls. The second and third versions of the story were given in even more glowing colors than the first; and, when the cars went whiz- zing back over the shining railroad track, they carried a less     328       CARRIE EEMERSON. weighty amount of venom with them. It had been given to the winds of Cliftonville.  Hapless Tom! I wonder if he ever thought of the time when he had been busily employed sowing tares in another garden; and, if he did, if he ever imagined he was getting his reward!    CHAPTER XXIV. Yet if thou wilt- if, " bound in spirit," thou Must go, and we shall see thy face no more, "The will of God be done!" We do not say Remember us - thou wilt - in love and prayer! And thou wilt be remembered - by the dead, When the last trump awakens them; by the old, When of the " silver chord" the last thread fails; By the bereaved and stricken; by the sad mother Pleading for her child, in murmurs difficult, Since thou art gone ; by all thou leavest, When the Sabbath-bell brings us together, And the closing hymn hushes our hearts to pray; Remembered thus - Remembered well. WILLIS. I shed for her no tear. She died With her last sunshine in her eyes. Earth held for her no joy beside The hope just shattered-- and she lies In a green nook of yonder dell; Peace to the broken-hearted dead! farewell! WILLIS. I WOULD like to introduce you to Mrs. Lee, the mother of gentle Annie Spaulding; but I do not, at this time, like to intrude. 'T is a busy hive. Nine or ten rosy-cheeked, chub-     330       CARRIE EMERSON. by-handed responsibilities, of whom the second eldest and  cherub-visaged youngest are twins. They followed each other in quick succession, for Annie is the eldest of the little troop, and she is only just nineteen. She was, until her mar- ri le, her mother's right-hand supporter in nursery cares and nursery government. The little ones obeyed her as quietly and unhesitatingly as they did their mother; and this may account for the womanly tact and superior qualities, in many- respects, of the gentle girl, who had transferred her intrinsic worth from the sanctuary of the family mansion to the more compllicated, if possible, at all events the more arduous, re-I sponsibilities of the parsonage. True, she was lively andc gay, joined her frolicsome glee, as occasions demanded, with the merry voices of her childhopd's and girlhood's companions; but still her mother had no fears for her capabilities, what- ever others might have entertained; and she only wondered   :. how she should ever bend the minds of the frolicsome Ella and Edna to come into the void she knew it was impossible  to  fill. Iitherto the still waters of the domestic haven had never' been ruffled. Economy, utility and industry, prevailed;  trouble of any kind had never molested. Except the little ailments incidental to children, sickness had never visited them; and if Mrs. Lee were considered a fixture in the fam- ily, save now and then half a day at church with her young tribe, and an occasional call updn a sick or otherwise afflicted neighbor, her numerous household duties must plead her excuse, if one be necessary. The occupants of the parsonage have left iTfor aye, and, for the few remaining days of their sojourn, have taken up   CARRIE EMERSON.          331 their abode at the family mansion. The voice of the father trembles as he reads the usual portion of Scripture, and an unwonted tear forces itself through the half-closed eyelids as he kneels with the yet unbroken circle, this lovely Sabbath morning. The mother's head is bent low upon the cushioned seat be- fore her, and she struggles inwardly but powerfully with the first actual sorrow she has ever known. Little half-suppressed sobs mingle at intervals with the deep-toned voice, wrestling, like Jacob, in prayer, and the young pastor, the hand of his devoted wife clasped within his own, utters at intervals also the scarcely audible "Amen!" It is a hallowed scene, and I may not intrude upon it longer. There is no trace of tears, only a sublime calm, upon the features, as each individual takes the accustomed seat in the fimily pew; and the lighting up of the devotional flame in each separate bosom is evident from the rapt attention and sympathetic enthusiasm beaming from eye and lip. They are soothed, cheered, and wonderfully strengthened for the ap- proaching trial. The new minister, who had arrived only a day or two pre- vious, was a large, noble-looking personage, with a high, in- tellectual cast of features, a low-toned, thrilling voice, an argumentative, imposing delivery, that carried all before it, demonstrative of rare elocutionary talent, and an air and manner capable of attracting the most hardened and careless, or of convincing the most determined casuist, that "Man's mind a kingdom is," and that, if he ploughed deep into the soil it was given him to cultivate, he was not without faith in the rich production.     332       CAIRRIE EMERSON. His opening address was a touching one-a powerful appeal  to every good and kindly sentiment that finds an abiding. place in the hunman bosom.                  X The response was all the largest heart could crave. Much as they loved and revered him who was about to go forth from them forever, and who would bear with him, in all his weary pilgrimage, the love and best blessing of many a good and noble heart, there would still be enough left and to spare for him who was appointed to fill his place; and it was the best balm they could possibly tender to the grieved hearts  they were parting with. There was no sordid, jealous feeling grappling for a strong  hold in the young pastor's bosom. By their appreciation of  his fellow-laborer in the field, he saw that his own feeble  efforts had been successful, and he blessed God for having substituted one in his place who would so efficiently fill every void his less practised endeavors had left untenanted. The house was filled, from gallery to vestibule, with an at- tentive audience, as is usual at such periods, drawn hither from other societies, from lethargic home-circles, who do not make "keeping holy the Sabbath day" of major impor- tance, from the outskirts of their own village, and even from the interior of their next neighbors'; curiosity, after all, being indispensably necessary to keep the social ball in motion. Great as was the gathering, it was nothing, comparatively, to the dense crowd that had congregated with the tolling of the bell for the afternoon service. Every nook and corner, broad aisle and side aisles, even the pulpit steps, were tlronged; and many more seated upon the green grass, under- neath the open windows, almost hushed their very breath to (   CARRIE EMERSON,          333 listen to the parting address, the eloquent ( farewell sermon," of the young and esteemed pastor, who, in addition to his own sorrowful task, had been called upon, -without an hour's previous notice, to preach a funeral sermon; thus mingling the public sympathies with a more hallowed and private grief. The'coffin which, in the brief intermission, had been brought into church, and placed before the altar, contained the body of a young and beautiful girl, whose sad history claims, with- out apology, an inopportune, perhaps, but necessary di- gression. She was the daughter of an opulent and enterprising farmer, some four miles from the interior of Cliftonville, whose broad acres and crowded granaries occupied, I might say, without encroaching upon truth, both soul and body. He made the best hay, raised the best cattle, kept the largest amount of poultry, boasted the richest orchard, the greatest variety of fruit, and, without mistake, displayed the most perfect workmanship in the construction of stone fences, and ample barns, with all the other appendages of a well- regulated, well-stocked New England farm. His wife was a model farmer's faithful counterpart.  The whole pride of her woman's nature was centred in her dairy, and culinary department. I doubt if any other woman with- in the circuit of ten miles could equal, much more excel her. Of her maternal functions I am somewhat less certain. She was the mother of twelve robust girls and boys; so in num- bers she was confident of being ahead of her more fortunate or unfortunate neighbors, just which they chose to consider themselves; and, as to bringing them up, why, they had come     334       CARRIE EMERSON. up themselves, pretty much as it happened to please them; their mother had never troubled herself as to the how. There was the village school for those who, by taking a long walk, and bending their minds to it, wished to be taught, or even  if they wanted companionship with those of their own ages; and there were churches, and plenty of good preaching, if  they would take pains to go; the Sabbath was a leisure day,  except in haying time, and they could ride as well as not. It was only for the young ones, however. The farmer took that day to walk over the farm and inspect it thoroughly; and the mother depended upon an extra nap in the morning, and sometimes another in the afternoon; besides, though not at all guilty of book-learning, she had a somewhat inordinate love of light-reading, and Sunday was the only time she could find to gratify it. If any one doubted that such a taste predominated, the romantic names bestowed upon some of the younger branches might corroborate the statement. There were Aurelia Sem- pronia, Constantia Alcesta, Almatia, Aspasia, etc.; and the boys rejoiced in similar high-sounding ones to match, and which sometimes, when reduced to diminutives, sounded both ludicrous and ridiculous. Of their abilities to climb fences and hay-mows, jump ditches, scale rocks, scamper through brake and brier, on foot or double mounted on horseback, there could be no question; the only wonder was how they escaped the thousand ills, in the shape of accident or misfortune, that the more carefully trained are subject to. Amongst the brood was one, as is very often the case in very   CARRIE EMERSON.          335 large families, entirely dissimilar, - Ariadne, the fair flower cut down in the spring-time of life. From her cradle she had proved in every possible way that though with them, she was not of them. The large dark eye, with its jetty fringe; the high pale brow; the delicate cheek, where scarcely the rose-leaf tint was visible; the profusion of glossy braids that circled: the small, well-formed head; and then the fragile form, graceful as a young willow; the small, exquisitely shaped hand, with its waxen-looking fingers; 'the half-dreamy look of absorption that characterized her usu- ally; stamped her from early childhood as a superior, if not a fated being. Poor thing! with dawning girlhood and budding beauty had come a longing for s" the far-off and unattainable," to her the undefinable. How the spirit yearned for sympathy! how the heart craved companionship! how the soul went out in longings for something akin to itself! As far as books would satisfy, she had, perhaps, the oppor- tunity of finding what she needed; but, without a guide to select and point out their intrinsic value, she but too often left untouched the wholesome and substantial food, for the light, vapory outpourings of sentiment or fiction. An innate' sensi- bility taught her to despise everything bordering upon vulgar- ity, while an inordinate love for what we term the poetry of nature made her constantly aspire to something above the ordinary stamp. To the members of her own family she was a perfect enigma. It is true, they never tried to solve what was mys- terious; they would have considered it a waste of time; not worth the trouble, certainly; and, if any one ever remarked, )     336       CARRIE EMERSON. in presence of the parents, how inlike she was to the rest of' the brood, they would answer: "Yes, Adne is a queer child. I don't see what we are going to do with her!"  Adne, as they designated her, had managed to attend school very steadily, considering the distance; and the Sabbath day found her invariably in the pew, hired to keep up appearances  with the rest of their little world; and, as time sped on, and i she grew more and more devoted in her attendance to the Sab- bath school privileges, she was often subjected to the jibes and speculations of her merry and mischievous brothers and sis- ters, who insisted that Adne was getting pious, and must remember them in her prayers. They did not dream that there was an attraction far more powerful, just then, than religion, exerting its influence upon her tender mind, and that it would blight like mildew the happiness she might otherwise have hoarded.  Edwin Spaulding was young, handsome, and irresistibly fascinating to such an one as Adne Hill. His simple and truth- ful eloquence touched and pervaded every corner of her mind. She watched every variation of his countenance; cherished as a hallowed thing every word that fell from his lips; and,  if a fleeting smile, or a friendly pressure of the hand, wel- comed her to the Sabbath school, or in their casual meetings, she brooded over it for weeks. She never thought of him in the light of a common mortal. She had studied Madame D'Arblay's Camilla, Madame De Stael's Corrinne, and Consuelo was in her hands oftener than her Bible; and from them she learned how to love, and to guard her heart's secret with jealous care. From living apart, she was but slightly acquainted with   CARRIE   EMERSON.        337 village news; and, from her peculiar and sensitive nature, still less so with village gossip. Consequently, the union of her heart's idol with another had fallen like a thunderbolt,- almost crushing the life from out its delicate framework. Poor, fragile blossom! She lay for weeks and weeks, pros- trated at a single blow. A slow nervous fever had succeeded the first shock; and it was months, even, before the feeble, fluttering spirit had conquered the overpowering sentiment, which to indulge was criminal. She recovered, at length, apparently, though more pensive and subdued than was quite natural; and, as a proof of their affection for her, and gratitude that death had spared them much trouble, as well as sorrow, they indulged her, if possible, more than ever. Poor Adne! She had schooled herself to see him lead his sweet young wife to her seat in church; to notice the eloquent eye,- how its gaze sometimes lingered upon the upturned face, with its innocent, child-like expression; and she became con- tent with listening once a week to the sound of a voice which to her ear was celestial music. She was a dreamer; never looking beyond the present moment for aught of stern reality. The ideal, the beautiful ideal, for the present, was enough. All at once came the astounding intelligence that the min- ister and his wife were about to depart for distant India; that, in all probability, they would never return. It was the one drop more to the overflowing bucket. The overtasked spirit quivered; the strained chord snapped -Ariadne was with the dead! The village doctor was speedily summoned, and pronounced 29     338       CARRIE EMERSON. it heart-complaint; ( he always knew she would go suddenly, when she did die."  Heart-complaint! Beautiful Ariadne! little did they dream, who lifted thy stricken form from the floor, where the sudden blow had felled thee,- or the kind-hearted old family physi- cian, who so vainly strove to restore animation,-how that heart was broken! And less still, he, who, in his ministerial duty, was called to eulogize thy many virtues, that it was love - wild, passionate love - strong, deep, undying, unhappy  love! If he had, could he have stood beside thee, in thine  unearthly beauty, the white roses circling the matchless brow as a coronal, the small hands clasped upon the motion- less bosom, as if to suppress the feverish emotion now andi forever at rest? Could he have laid his hand so calmly upon the pure, spiritual face, and felt no thrill of anguish for the suffering that had made it so transcendently beautiful? Could he have poured forth that strain of touching language in such a calm, clear, unimpassioned voice, had but one faint whisper  of the truth fallen upon his car? And, when he blessed God for the evidence of salvation, as manifested in her strict at- tention upon all their holy ordinances, would he not have recoiled with holy horror, had he only faintly dreamed that love for the creature, instead of the Creator, had actuated every motive? As it was, God had spared him the bitter trial; and the tear that dimmed his eye, as it rested upon her, and the quiv- ering tone, as it came from the heart, in that last prayer, at the close of the funeral service, would have been the same had any other than Ariadne been the sleeper! Again he ascended the pulpit; and a lingering, loving look   CARRIE EMERSON.          339 rested upon face after face, as, one and all, their gaze was lifted to his own. A struggle, so powerful that it shook like an aspen the slight but manly form, and spread a pallor white and chill as that upon the outstretched clay beneath, passed slowly over his face; and a death-like silence seemed to have arrested the words upon the white and rigid lips. A sob of unrestrained anguish, from some one in the audi- ence, broke the strange spell; and, for another hour, the senses of the dense congregation were enthralled by the simple eloquence of that sad "Farewell!" If there was a dry eye there, it was because it had forgotten how to weep. With the last faintly uttered word, "Farewell," the young pastor sank back upon the cushioned seat, and with his spread hand shut out the eager faces; he felt that his own was pallid as death. The new minister arose, laid his hand a moment upon the young man's bowed head, and then, in husky tones, pro- nounced the benediction.  Silently and sadly the vast congregation departed, all but the stricken family, who had gathered around the coffin, to take a last look of the "( early lost." Again the hand of him so idolized rested a brief moment upon the icy brow, as he, too, looked his last; and, as his eye glanced upon the inscription, he repeated: "Seventeen -it is young to die; but what a glorious immortality!" A few days afterwards, and the white cliffs were swarming with life. A noble ship was ploughing her way through the blue waters, every inch of canvas suread to the wind; and     340       CARRIE   EMERSON. the foam that followed her wake was pure and white as the  snow of an Alpine summit. She stood in, for a brief space, as near the rocky shore as was practicable, and a white signal fluttered in the breeze. Instan- taneously one simultaneous shout went up from the assembled  multitude; and then their voices joined in their pastor's favorite anthem.           e Long before it was finished the proud ship had careened to the breeze; and, with a graceful sweep, that laid her whole  broadside to the water's edge, had rounded the headland, and was standing out to the open sea. God speed them on their mission!-they will return no more!   CHAPTER XXV. Through sorrow and through suffering thou hast passed, To show us what a woman true may be. J. R. LOWELL, CARRIE, dear, I have bad news for you," said Henry, as he took a seat beside Carrie, at table. "I came across a paper to-day that mentioned the departure of a number of missionaries; amongst them I saw the names of Mr. and Mrs. Spaulding. There's a damper for your bright anticipations, already!" Tears sprang to the eyes of Carrie, as she gave utterance to her sincere regret. "When are we going home?" she asked, after a pause. "It is so long since we heard anything from the dear ones there, that I begin to feel anxious." "So I say," said Isabel. "We 've travelled half over the continent, and seen everything worth the trouble. Let's go home." "So I say," said Edward. "I begin to think it time we turned our faces thitherward. Here's Percy; if he agrees, we 'll start forthwith." "I?  I'll agree to anything you propose; so what is it?" 29*     342       A RRIE EMERSON. "To go home - home to Cliftonville," said Carrie. "How I long for the dear familiar haunts of my childhood; to be clasped once more to the hearts of both my parents; to answer some of Willic's innumerable questions; to see Jennie, and Cora,-I was going to say, Annie! Dear Annie! how I wish I could have seen her once more!" "And here 's Bel, crying for company! This is a state of things that will never answer, Harry. Our wives will leave us to take care of ourselves, if we don't indulge them; so, let's get our baggage together, and ticket it for home." Soon the little party were on the return route to meet the steamer; and, while they are speeding homewards, we 'll look in upon Carrie's home at Cliftonville. A telegraphic despatch has informed them of the pleasure awaiting them; and, for once, there is something like excitement at the quiet home- stead. Willie's mother had forgotten to put a veto on his spreading the glad tidings, and it is already disseminating far and wide. It would be rather a tedious task to go from house to house, and listen to the remarks of those who make it the business of their lives commenting upon other people's affairs; so we 'll just stay quietly at Carrie's home, and help receive the numerous callers. "O, Mrs. Emerson! you are the most incomprehensible woman I know of! Why can you not, for once in your life, step out from that quiet reserve of yours, and give vent to some of the thousand-and-one pleasurable emotions we all know must be struggling in your bosom? You know you are proud of your handsome daughter; of your rich son-in- law; of where they have been, and how they have been re-   CARRIE EMERSON.          343 ceived among the distinguished of other lands; whom they have travelled with, etc.!" "Don't you suppose we know Ed. Ashley and his beautiful southern bride were with them?- and don't you suppose we all take a kindly interest in his affairs?" "Is he going to bring her to Cliftonville; or has she got homesick, and must go home?" "Is Mr. Percy Hamilton with them? and has he recovered his health? and do you think he has forgotten poor Ellen Grant? It is my candid opinion that he did n't deserve her! Will Juan come with them? I 'm rejoiced to hear it; you can't imagine what an interest I felt in the little fellow, when he was thrown upon our pitiless rocks!" "Pshaw! how shockingly disagreeable to be obliged to fill our budget piecemeal! I wish to my soul that for the pres- ent you were a whole-souled Catholic, and I were your ghostly confessor; I 'd see if you would n't make a clean breast of it! We don't care, just now, about -M3rs. Barre's sick child. They've had the doctor; and, if he can't cure it, why, we can't help it. And if poor old Mrs. Jones has scalded her foot, and ought to have assistance immediately, there are plenty, no doubt, will go right in, as soon as they hear of it.?' "And, O dear! as to troubling yourself, just now, with Mrs. Elliot's sorrow, I think you may be excused from even thinking about it. It seems mighty queer for a young girl, like her Augusta, to give way to anything that would bring on insanity! People pretend to say that it's a religious mo- nomania; but that's all perfect nonsense. I believe the girl is in love. She's as handsome as a picture, and her mother has kept her as close as a veiled nun; but she may have lost     344       CARRIE EMERSON. her heart, for all that. I know you have a deal more charity than I have, my dear Mrs. Emerson, but, la; don't let's talk about it; it always makes me dreadful nervous." "Yes, I suppose I ought to send my two little girls to the Saturday sewing-school; it would, to be sure, be a pleas- ant performance of duty, both to them and Bliss Haskell. And she says you proposed it. Ha! ha! I wish you had a little girl to send, now. Really! going to send Willie, to  learn to draw? Well, I should think it was a capital idea.  Iow it will assist her in her praiseworthy endeavor to make  herself useful, and independent of that cross father-in-law of  hers! And then, our public schools are excellent, but they do not, of course, allow needle-work brought into them, and how in the world are the young ones to learn to sew? It is quite too much trouble to teach them at home; my nerves would never admit of it; I should go distracted." "Well, yes; I do think sea-bathing excellent and a walk through the woods delightful; but, dear me! I would no more walk a mile and a half, as you do every day, down to Sandy Cove, because it is such a capital place, if I never took a bath. No doubt it is conducive to health; and exer- cise, of course, is highly necessary; but, for my part, I'd ten times rather dress and walk up town; make a call or two, go into the milliner's, or the new variety store. I like to turn over the silks and muslins, and price them, or get patterns, if I don't buy. I assure you it passes away the time very agreeably." "a! ha! makes needless trouble for clerks and shop- boys. Well, if you don't have some of the most absurd scru-   CARRIE EMERSON.          345 ples, and comical ideas! I wouldn't like to say that aloud,. or to your face, though." "Who, pray, cares for clerks or shop-boys; or even for the head of the establishment, if he happen to be present? That's what they're hired for, I suppose. I declare! how time flits away! I have extended my call beyond the limits of a visit, almost. You must call it a visitation, my dear Mrs. Emer- son. I don't know how it is, but time always passes so agreeably with you; pray excuse me for encroaching upon your time just now." "( Not at all hurried; all in readiness to receive them! Positively, it would have taken me a month!" There, reader; there is a specimen of a dozen or so of our all-at-once would-be sticklers of village observances, and village requirements. "O, certainly, we must call upon Mrs. Emerson! We have neglected her too long, to be sure; but what matter?" "Sure enough; and what matter whether or not we have heretofore only been slightly acquainted; whether or not there is affinity or congeniality in our natures; whether or not, from her peculiarly sensitive nature, she may not just at this time prefer the omission of attentions and civilities we have not been accustomed to show her? Her bosom and brain must be teeming with images of past, present, and to come; how selfish, that she would n't say just a few words to the purpose! I'm sure I did everything delicacy would per- mit, but she kept branching off to other topics, trying to in- terest me in Tom, Dick, and Harry. I 'd given something to hear of Harry Irving's movements, though. She can be very eloquent, even communicative, if you touch the right chord.     346       CAR 1 IE EMERSON. I'm sure, I thought Carrie would be the right chord. Strange! but I think I flattered her a little, and women, - excuse me, - everybody is susceptible of flattery. Perhaps she will be a little more talkative when we meet again. She was very polite, as it was, and, judging from rumor, more than usually benevolent." (Does a heart, brimming over with its own exclusive happiness, not expand, and overflow into all that circles it?) "I wish she'd realize how gratifying it is to one's neighbors and friends to be associated with all their p)leasures. "I hate selfishness; it corrodes and tarnishes the best part of our natures. I hope Mrs. Irving does not partake of her mother's reserve; for we mean to show her every atten- tion in our power. I scorn the vulgar idea, as much as any one can, of trying to overstep certain little barriers in the scale of conventionalism; it is too much like stooping to the rich, just because they are rich. "Suppose some of them are beings of a higher order; who wants to cavil about their superiority? They are just what God has made them, I suppose. "Here's lawyer Ellis, just taken possession of his splendid new mansion ; and the Ionorable Amos Alden, and that rich old Madame Durivage.  I don't know, neither do I care, in what consists the superiority of their exclusive qualifications. They've got money, and they're aristocratic; and they'll tower above us if they can; and. they may if they please. Will Carrie Emerson,- excuse me, Mrs. Irving, -join their clique? and, if she should, should n't I like to pull her down to a level with some others who are not quite as refined, but   CARRIE EMERSON.          347 would pass with her in a crowd? Why, I suppose it will be attributed to her position in life." "( Certainly; she 's the wife of a wealthy merchant; and, if there's nothing else to bring as a recommendation, there's the almighty dollar; and that's enough, any time. "( True, she's intelligent, and lady-like; and will have all the polish foreign travel can give her, and that's considera- ble; but, after all, she's only Carrie Emerson; and I, for one, don't relish her going up in the ranks of those who have got a fair start in the world's great moving caravansera." And what will she do, we wonder? Will she bow at the shrine of fashion; wink at its frivolities and absurdities; grow heartless and hackneyed, callous and indifferent; for- get her childhood's friends, in their humility and simplicity,- it may be sincerity,--for the glittering devotee, who has drawn in her numerous qualifications with her mother's milk? Will she condescend to patronize some one or two of them once in a while, just to show her magnanimity; exercise her womanly tact in canvassing for her husband's benefit, whether he be a politician, or simply a merchant? Will she stoop to flatter them into the belief that she feels their equality, and then, by the most unequivocal demonstration, say, "Stand back! I am better than thou?" Will she seek the applause of the world? Will she barter the wealth of the heart's best affections, - the true-hearted, high-hearted, and noble, - crush the poor glow-worm, in her eagerness to bagk in the reflected light of another's more bril- liant name and fame?     \ Never! God forbid that Carrie Emerson, or any one else that we love and respect, should so degenerate. No; Carrie     3418      CARRIE E MERSON  is a being, we are happy to say, of altogether a different order.  She has made her visit to her dear old home, has left not a shadow upon her movements there, except a very little cen- sure, that she should be seen-she, a married lady-sitting with a young gentleman upon the green turf that covered Ellen's grave, shedding tears, both of them!-no use trying to make excuses now, - and then walking home with him, just as innocently as if it were her husband! Shocking impru. dence! She has, with every demonstration of affection and regret, parted with Edward and Isabel Ashley, whose love and friendship is worth more than aught else on earth, except her mother's, and of course her husband's. And she has re- turned to her own home, taken her place in the world and society, as one not to be sullied by its fiivolities, not to be hardened by its selfishness, not to be dazzled by its tinseled glare, infected by its malaria of false pride, its prejudices, or deceptiveness; but to be what God and nature meant she should,--a woman! a woman, in the truest, fullest sense of the word. Do not sneer, kind reader, just at the bare summing up of all the foregoing pages in a single word. Do we not all know that many who are called women are but mere apologies for such? Sometimes they get above the vulgar term, and call it lady; but what then?  Can we not see at a single glance how sadly they belie both name and nature? Have they not a high and' holy mission, a pure and noble incentive, in the path it is theirs to tread, be it in the higher or lower ranks of life? What matter if her dwelling be the mud hovel, or the mar-   CARRIE EMERSON.          349 ble palace? Is it not hers to make the waste places bloom; to throw her cheering influence over the gloomiest spots we are doomed to tread? And, if she be the " weaker vessel," need she brave the tempest? Has not man's sterner nature fitted him for that? And if she lean upon his strong arm and heart, with confidencp and faith, will he not protect and guard her " woman's rights" even better than if she stood at the helm herself? I have often smiled to hear women cavil about their rights, who were sadly neglectful of some most exclusively and undisputedly theirs; who, in the imaginary fear that even an iota of the prerogative they claimed as "right" should be pilfered from them, have totally overlooked the only thing that could not fail to secure to them all- the right they could desire. That man must be unworthy the name, who would not give to wife, mother or sister, all the meed of justice or of praise, if she fulfil the part assigned her in the domestic haven. But if dark fate, or sterner duty, bid her brave the tempest, need she shrink or turn aside, even though the rough waters threaten to engulph her? I think not. I know that she may rise and free herself from at least the chain of flimsy net- work false pride weaves around her. I know, that with the attributes nature has bestowed, and which are her unalienable right, she may throw off every shackle that deception, or indifference, or supineness, may seek to fetter her with; and, if she do, what is to hinder her from being all that God or nature intended should constitute WOMAN? 30     350       CARRIE EMERSON. Quite a homily I have given you, kind reader; and now, if you are not too weary, please to skip a few pages in the old manuscript of time, and listen to a conversation between Mrs. Emerson and her cousin, before we take our leave of Cliftonville. ";Do you know, Lucy, that I thought you would have grown tired of Cliftonville, and would have left it long agc?" "Why so, Annette?" "O, because there were some busybodies here, who were determined to see everything in a wrong light - who were un- scrupulous in their judgment ; and I knew your strong, inde- pendent nature would never succumb to prejudice or opinion. I knew they talked about you; that they could not or would not understand you; and I imagined you would grow weary and disgusted. I give you credit for more patience than I am mistress of." "Well, I liked the place, Annette; and so I resolved to live down the prejudice, or whatever it was; and I flatter myself I have succeeded, in a measure." "Perhaps you have, Lucy; I hope so, at least. It must have been very trying, though - the idea that, oftentimes, after a social chat with a neighbor or professing friend, the moment your back was turned, you were made the subject of criticism or ridicule! I 've seen enough, at different times, when I've been here; and sometimes I feared you were wrong in not trying to conciliate a little, and bow to the world's received opinion, as it was represented here." "Yes; and, by so doing, offend conscience, and deprive myself of a vast amount of real pleasure, to say nothing of happiness."   CARRIE EMERSON.          351 "There has been a great change since you first came here to reside." "Yes, there has. Society has been, and is still, undergoing a mighty change." "Do you think it a beneficial one, Lucy?" "Yes, in many respects; in a few, perhaps, not quite as well. Cliftonville can boast its lyceum, its assembly rooms, its mechanical association, its pulpit oratory; manufactories have risen up like magic;- why, even the roar of your de- lightful waterfall - your beautiful miniature cataract -is lost in the clatter of a complicated mass of machinery! The old haunted mill has undergone a thorough change, also. Not a ghost can flit through the crumbling ruins; -it is finished and filled to overflowing; and, if a groan issues from the old walls, it is because flor and rafters are laden. It has become a fashionable watering-place, also; and I should n't be surprised if, in an incredibly short time, our beautiful village were to lose its own identity. Already there have been whispers of its incorporation." "And then, farewell to all the pleasant images that fancy or feeling has ever created as inseparable from the beauty and simplicity of sucli a place as this! It grieves me to think, dear Cliftonville, of thy degenerate sons and daughters! I can see it, even now, Lucy." "Nonsense, Annette! You can see the same beautiful landscape which so charmed you years ago. Do you think it possible for Cliftonville to lose its beauty wholly?" "No, not while a particle of romance lingers in your na- ture; and yet, perhaps, by-and-by, the halo that encircles it will fade, and you 'll think it was only a mirage. I 'llven- /     352       CARRIE EMERSON. ture, now, that a spirit is creeping in, that in time you'll find is hydra-headed -almost as formidable as the monster Willie discovered when he was a little boy!" "Well, Annette," said the now graceful youth, "that ser- pent left a disagreeable sensation in its trail. I tell you, I never have forgotten it; and I would rather encounter all the hydra-headed monsters society ever engendered, than scandal, any way,- let it come in what guise it will. And now, tell me, if you please, why you think the old time-honored spot of my childhood will suffer from the innovation of its many new-coiners. They are mostly business men, or those who, transacting business in the city, show their good taste by se- lecting a place like this to retire to after the turmoil of the day is over. If they build splendid edifices, it only improves the natural beauty of the place; it brings up general society to a more exalted level; refines, if it does not purify; and, of course, as the means of knowledge become more extensive, happiness must follow ii its wake." ' That is only a one-sided view, William; show us the opposite." "Thank you, Annette! We are in the germ. What you call one-sided is enough to satisfy me; and I'll leave it to mother, if, with an increase of population, we do not derive many real blessings. Just think of our privileges! A few years ago, if you had asked some of our quiet, homespun people what a lyceum was, they would have referred you to the dictionary; and now they cavil more about the merits and demerits of our different lecturers than some of our more highly educated ones. They mean well, I know; but sometimes it is really laughable."   CARRIE EMERSON.          353 "It will be really pitiable when it gets a few paces further. I can read it at a single glance. Already have cliques and classes sprung up amongst you; the dividing line is drawn, and who may o'erstep the boundary? There are OUR socie- ties, and OUR clubs, OUR parties and OUR churches; and what, I pray you, may constitute a membership? If you can't answer, your mother can. She has realized changes enough to know that prosperity is the one great requisite, if-you wish to get at the top round of the ladder all are climbing. i"Ambition is as imperative and overbearing as a slave-driv- er! If one gets up an inch to-day, some one else will distance him to-morrow. If Mrs. Allen goes to Boston one day, and returns with a new bonnet or mantilla, Mrs. Barlow will push on to New York the very next, for something more stylish, or, at least, more costly. Here's Louisa Eldrich making herself unhappy because she can't afford a rich brocade, such as Miss Marie Ellis wears quite common; and even Mrs. Henderson, with her contracted ideas of female adorning, is determined to have a moire antique, cost what it will: Mr. Henderson may put off building that new barn another year, just as well as not; we have but one life to live--it's a pity we can't enjoy it! "Half a dozen years ago, Mrs. Reed's purple velvet was the all-absorbing topic; everybody had a perfect right to call her extravagant. Now, the new barouche and spirited grays are the envy of half Cliftonville. Who dares call her extrava- gant? She has trampled down public opinion, established her position in society, and has no fears of a derogatory whisper- not she; and yet, Lucy, you and I, who knew her in child- hood, and who, even then, despised her for her heartless neg- 30*     354       CARRIE  EMERSON. lect of her invalid mother, her contempt of her father's poor but honest calling, know, from even the most trivial demon- stration, that her disposition is unaltered; and for all the wide world we would not exchange places with her, if, by so doing, we must take also her unwomanly, selfish nature. Yesterday, when we took our usual ramble to the beach, we went another way, in order that I might see some of the splendid country- seats which have been erected during the last few years; and, in peering through the close, high shrubbery, to get a view of some magnificent exotics we knew were in bloom, a surly gar- dener came out, and, after a moment's scrutiny, let loose a large, savage-looking mastiff, whose growl was sufficient to warn us we were venturing upon forbidden ground. Poor pedestrians! If we had alighted from a handsome vehicle, or had trailed in the dust a quarter of a yard of rich brocade, or sewing-silk muslin, anything that would have betokened gran- deur, most likely we should have been left at liberty to admire. what we chose, wander, perhaps, through the diversified paths, recline upon the tasteful garden-chairs, and, perhaps, have been allowed to bring away a splendid bouquet of choicest flowers! I tell you what, William, when we were gathering the fragurant buds that are making your cottage parlor redo- lent of perfume, you must forgive me if I thought the acquisi- tion of Cliftonville not at all to be envied. Your mother was silent; but I wonder if, in her heart, she did not reciprocate the sentiment." "I'll venture to say she did not waste a thought upon them; did you, mother mine?" "No, my son; only a stray pitying one. You must put your pet Charley into the carryall this afternoon, and drive   CARRIE EMERSON.          355 us over to the Livermore residence. Annette must have something pleasurable to efface the effect of the arrogance and cxclusiveism of Cliftonville's mushroom aristocracy. We'll show her undisputed precedence in the ranks of what the world calls 'the one thing needful.' You may roam through the extensive gardens, taste the luscious fruit, admire the pet deer, or the bantam chicks, note how tastefully nature and art have mingled their separate qualifications, and then, if you wish to read the character, or even the heart, of the few who are left of the once large family, sit down awhile in the quiet, shaded parlor, and join the social converse. I 'll guar- antee you will heir no refined allusions to Mr. A.'s want of method in the management of his valuable estate, although every one knows, within the circuit of ten miles, that it is past redemption. "Every one does not know, however, that it is through the generosity and kindness of the Livermores that Mr. A. still keeps his head above water, and that his happily unconscious family are still tenants of the homestead." "I don't believe there is a poor family within seven miles, who have not in some way or other been benefited by their liberality; and yet, their generosity is not proverbial. I never heard it blazoned through the columns of a newspaper, that Harvard University had received a donation, that this or that association had been enriched;, but ask that old lady who sits in the vine-shaded window of a sweet little cottage, sur- rounded with every evidence of comfort, yes, and to her grate- ful vision, 'luxury,' to whom she is indebted for all the kindness which has changed her sorrowing widowhood into a glad and cheerful existence; and she will, with a bright     356       ACARRIE EMERSON. smile, which may seem at variance with the humid eye, point you to the beautiful mansion across the fields. She is not a bit afraid you'll make a blunder, and think she means the lordly owner of the manor-house close by; there is not a particle of jealousy in that good old heart; gratitude has harbored there so long, and she has been sunned by whole- souled benevolence so steadily, that it has eradicated all the weeds and thistles which might otherwise have taken root and flourished. "Y( ou would not like to question that gentleman whose ar- tistical talent ranks among the best in our country, whose por- trait his boyish fingers sketched with a beating heart and doubtf'ul nind . Tlhe smile that was a sweet reward, and the lips that so kindly praised, encouraged, and breathed the latenlt hope into the soul's secret depths, are, perchance, gone from, the cherished group he cannot choose but venerate; it is enough that you may trace his rising genius in the more finished productions, as from time to time they have been tran lferred from the studio to the ancestral halls of those who firt discovered the budding germ. I could enumerate many more traits of true nobility, but it is needless; one glance at the features, one sound of the pleasant tones, will at once es- taDlish your faith in them, and you will be ready to exclaim, with Miss Barrett, Learn more reverence -not for rank or wealth: that needs no learning; Tht cnmes quickly -quick as sin does; ay, and often leads to sin. Jut for Adain's seed, fAN'! trust me 't is a clay above your scorning, With God's image stamped upon it, and God's kindling breath within.' "O, Annette! why should you or I be put down by inso- lence or arrogance?  Do we not know  that as pilgrims   c ARIR IE EMEr. rS ONs.      357 travelling to the same great bourn, we must 4xpect to be jostled, and sometimes crowded from our pleasant pathway, by those whose grasping propensities predominate over even- handed justice?-to the same eternal rest, where we shall be acknowledged, not for the rank we have arrived at while res- idents of God's footstool, but for the amount of knowledge we have gleaned, and for the use we have made of each intrinsic jewel committed to our keeping." "I know all that, Lucy; but does it not make you almost angry, when you think how some are permitted to revel in luxury, and not only that, but almost tread you into the dust to do it, when, if common justice only held her sway, you might tower far above them? I know of some who have risen to affluence within a few years, who have struggled desperately to get a foothold, even, upon the platform of fashion; who are creeping stealthily but steadily into the foremost ranks df moneyed aristocracy; whose vulgarity will in time be eclipsed -for I defy even time to polish what nature has created so inveterately rough and ungainly -by the sordid exterior of accumulated dollars and cents, ay, even mills. Up, up they go, over the ruins of more than one unfortunate bankrupt; over the destruction of whole hosts of paltry indi- viduals, whose great stumbling-block, in the world's opinion, was a pebble in the bottom of the wine-cup. Was it the distiller's fault that it was not cast out? No, indeed! Why, he 'll argue more to the point than even Gough, or any other champion of temperance, that his business is perfectly harm- less. We - he - could n't do without it at all. Why, if it were not a somewhat degrading subject, and nature had only bestowed upon him a fluent utterance, he'd take the stand in     358       CARRIE EMERSON. the public lecture-room, and if he couldn't convince his audience that strong drink was beneficial, and that an immdd- crate use of it was the easiest thing in the world to avoid, he could make them understand that you can press golden coin from the purple juice, in quantities that might tempt the most unambitious to covet. "I might become personal, and ask you how you relish being made a stepping-stone; how you can look so calmly  upon yon noble mansion, which you so proudly helped to plan, whein you know that the revellers there are dancing upon your husband's hard-earned, but crushed and ruined fortune. Are you trusting to God's mercy, or man's justice, while you go so peacefully onward? Suppose, after struggling manfully a few years more, - he, with toil, and care, and the pressure of cir- cumstances none can foresee or forego; you, with privation, mortification, and the difficulties none but a wife and mother can know, - you raise another structure, and adverse fate bat- ters it down again? Human endurance cannot be expected to last forever. Shall you still look hopefully forward; shall you simply pity those who trample you down, instead of branding them as they deserve?" "I will trust in God's mercy, Annette; yes, and to His justice, too. Every particle that has been withheld from me and mine shall, at some future period, be restored with com- pound interest! Mine is no towering spirit, that only longs to soar upon the wing of worldly aggrandizement; but mine is a spirit that would render to the world its due, even to the uttermost farthing. God has willed me the fiery trial; thus far I have passed through it unscathed. It shall fit me for something higher and nobler than wealth or rank can give.   CARRIE  EMERSON.        359 If it were not so, I never could have borne"'e accumulated weight of bitter trials, such as even you have never dreamed of. ,' I will have the respect of the good and honorable, - and that is all I crave of them,--because I have endeavored to deserve it. The withholding it would not impoverish them; and that of all who are beneath them, in the estimation of even my simple judgment, is not worth having. Some I scorn, and some I pity; and God, who knows the heart, knows that I do not envy them." "And what encouragement have those who toil on, unceas- ingly, stemming the tide with a strong arm, and almost nerv- less heart, if at last they must sink into poverty and obscurity? Some cannot swim,--they cannot even learn, and others are beaten back by an overwhelming force. The cur- rent of society forces them onward, the strong under-current gives them a never-failing impetus; and, woe be to those who are slow and feeble, or have lost sight of the guiding-star of hope! Suppose they have no energy, what must be their fate?" "Well, according as fate wills it. If they sink in the dark waters of oblivion, or gain the shore, and, toiling along the weary way, leave no imprint in the sand, is it any reason why another should grow discouraged, and follow a weak or worse example? All cannot prosper alike. There must, necessarily, be grades to society--'hewers of wood, and drawers of water;' but, as long as they bear God's image, and do not deface it by sin or folly, what shall hinder them from enjoying a share, albeit a stinted one, of life's varied blessings? "My father went down to the grave, and yours is just lin- gering upon the threshold, with more than a common share     360       CARRIE EMERSON. of life's t   combat with; a keen sense of wrong and bitter injury tracking them every inch of the way; name, fame, and patiimony, stolen or monopolized; and yet we glory in the unsullied honor that circles round them both. 'The noblest work of God! '- is it not worth all they have ever suffered, to know a gaping world dare not withhold this most precious meed of justice? And now, Annette, let's climb this glorious summit, and gaze around upon the varied scenery. There lies old Ocean, blue and bright as the firmament above it; and see, through yon leafy thicket, that silvery-looking stream. What if it do pour its tributary waters, its unfailing strength, over that time-worn gateway? You need not listen to the clatter of machinery, but there is melody in the curling, wreathing wavelets, as they rush in playfully among the chasms, or leap high up over the jagged rocks. You need not listen to the sound of chisel or hammer, and yet you cannot fail to admire the architect's and mechanic's skill, as yon splendid edifice rises imposingly from the hitherto unimproved spot of fallow land. And if hereafter the polished clay who may chance to inhabit it should presume to look down upon us in our more humble walks, shall it take one particle from the proud inde- pendence of our natures, when we remember that Children of wealth or want, to each is given One spot of green, and all the blue of heaven;' and that without the pure coin there could be no base counterfeit?"
