                 THE HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. BY HELEN HAZLETT. PHLADELPHIA: WILLIAM S. & ALFRED MARTIEN, No. 608 CHESTNUT STREET. 1859.      Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1858, by WILLIAM S. & ALFRED MARTIEN, In the Office of the Clerk of the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.   IPREFAC]    . IN sending forth this little work to the public, the principal object of the authoress is to place Christianity in its true light-to show its present and ultimate effect upon the human race; itE power in soothing every sorrow, and enlighten. ing every path, however dark heretofore. In taking a retrospect of society, the eye was fixed upon persons whose characters bore a strong resemblance to some prominently por. trayed in the story, the delineation of which, to those unobservant of human nature, may appeal too highly wrought to be consistent with com- mon-place events; but it has been the writer's study to introduce characters neither worse nor better than those with whom all have daily and hourly intercourse in their walk through life.     8         PREFACE. If the authoress succeed in showing any de- fects in character, thereby leading to an amend- ment, or if, perchance, her exhibitions of truth should lead a misguided Romanist to seek that truth as it is in Jesus, she will feel amply repaid for all the time and trouble spent in the pre- paration of the volume, and will bless God that she has been led to place it before the public.   THE HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG, CHAPTER I. "Discretion guard thine asking, Discretion aid thine answer, Teach thee that well-timed silence Hath more eloquence than speech." "CAN I say nothing to dissuade your venturing upon the stream to-night, Carl? the waters are at flod4ide, and a storm is certainly gathering."     ; There was a mournful earnestness in the voices of the speaker; he was standing by the side of a small boat, leaning against the rock from which his friend was busily 'disengaging a chain; he sigied- as th freed hook fell against his foot, and the elanknig chain into the boat. The oars were then throwniin; and the sail adjusted. "All is ready now, Ernest," said the youth, step- ing to his side, "I regret I must be deaf to all your pleadings, for I promised my father and little Elsie to be home this evening surely, and I have never yet broken my faith with them. History will never be     10     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. able to tell of the hour when Carl Ravenscroft wil- lingly disobliged Ernest Vancleve, nor am I more willing, dear Ernest, to hold a promise -unperformed to my father. That black cloud I shall leave in the distance in a few minutes, and no doubt my beautiful 'Sea Bird' will harbour in James' Cove in less than an hour." "There is thunder," exclaimed Ernest, "and"--he was interrupted by the sudden appearance of his father's gardener, who, hearing voices, had been drawn to the spot. "Is it yerself, Misther Carl, who are going to try the smoothness of the waters to-night in that craft? the mither and the childer cannot be wanting me, or I would take an oar mnself." "Thank you, Michael," said Carl, "but as you would not have as much reason for the risk, I shall go alone." "Well, well, Misther Carl, she's as good as her name, and its yourself has an arm for her oars, and sure the Niese is no more than a play ground to you, so don't ye be standin' and talkin' an the like, and p'raps the storm will be afther and not before ye, at all, at all. Well, good night to ye, young gentlemen, and our Blessed Mither protect you, Misther Carl." "I wish Mike could have gone with you, Carl, but may Heaven preserve you, and our Holy Mother land you safely at Eisendorf!" The youth reverently raised his hat at the come menoement of the invocation, but it had been firmly obI   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBRRG.! replaced before the conclusion. He fixedhis bright dark eye upon Ernest, his whole countenance was illuminated, but it might be doubtful whether scorn, or pity predominated in the smile that played around his mouth. It had never been contested that Carl Ravenscroft was the handsomest young man in that province. His maternal ancestry had bestowed the olive conm- plexion, and entirely Spanish cast of feature; to the Ravenscroft descent he owed his chestnut curls and faultless brow. He and Ernest Vancleve were of the same age, both tall and slightly built. Ernest was entirely German, light hair, and florid complexion, very large mouth, but relieved by a magnificent set of teeth. He, too, was handsome, but did not bear comparison with his friend Carl. "My dear Ernest," he almost whispered, after a few moments pause, "I would not wish to disrobe the Virgin Mary of any honour due her, but indeed I should expect to lose my rudder were she to take the helm. I beg leave to decline her guidance. No, no," he continued, raising his voice, "no, Ernest, I commit myself and my skiff to Him, and to Him alone, who has power to bid the raging waves be still There is no record that the Madonna ever had-- I mean no offence, Ernest-" "I believe you, Carl, your arrows are headless when pointed at me alone, but they peemed" barbed when aimed at the Holy Mother; but go, Carl, there I    whe pone  tm  lnbtte    emdbre     12      HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. is thunder in the distance; there have been no sha- dows in the past between us-we part good friends." "And will always remain such, Ernest," replied Carl, laying his hand affectionately on his shoulder, "and the time will come when we shall not differ even in our religious opinions." With a cordial shake;of the hand, he jumped into the boat, which like something living, proud of its owner, was soon riding over the billows. Ernest stood as one spell bound to the spot; he had often heard Carl sing, but as his voice now came back upon the breeze, there seemed to him a peculiar, an almost painful sweetness in it; the words, too, were impressive, he listened breathlessly: "Jesus, Saviour of my soul, Let me to thy bosom fly, While the billows o'er me roll, While the tempest still is high. Hide me, O! my Saviour, hide, Till the storm of life be past; Safe into the haven guide; O! receive my soul at las*." Towards the close of the verse he could not distino guish the words; the voice, too, now melted away in the distance, and his eye sought in vain for the least vestige of the boatman. He stood watching the dark waters, as the tide still gained upon the shore, with alternate hope and fear. The Niese seldom had been so flooded, heavy rains   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.  had deluged the whole country this season, such a' had never been in the remembrance of the bldes dweller there; the river might sometimes be forded   and was generally so smooth, that the young men an, lads of the Eidelberg school spent their leisure hour in boat-racing over it. It was a beautiful stream having its source in a valley, among the Eidelber1 Heights, and flowing into a bay equally beautiful !III TThe whole country, on either side of the river, wa exceedingly romantic, covered with hills, vineyards and cultivated vales, as far as the eye could reach On one of the western hills stood the school-house, s built, and so divided, as separately to accomodat Protestant and Roman Catholic pupils; and th institution was deservedly patronized and well sup ported by all the elite of both Eidelberg and Elsidori The two principals, and all the teachers of both pal ties, were able men, perfect gentlemen, and thei society added greatly to the charm of the place Carl Ravenscroft frequently remained during th week, and had done so the one preceding the Saturda on which we find him with Ernest Vancleve, on th banks of the Niese.

Large drops of rai admonishing him of his own insecurity, he oonvu sively clasped his hands together, and exclaime aloud, "O! Holy lmother!"  Suddenly cheekin himself, he cast himself on his knees, and in broke 2*     "     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. accents cried out, "His God-the God of the Protes- etants-deliver him from the deep waters-for the Holy"-he paused, "for the Holy Jesus' sake." When he arose the rain was falling fast, and the lightning darting in quick successive flashes. As he drew near the lodge of Michael, he heard the happy voices of his children. At any other time, under other circumstances, Ernest would have stopped to enjoy their merriment, but, without heeding them, he hastily turned the hill, into the avenue leading to his father's house. The ancient mansion of Baron Vancleve might have been built centuries back, and had been the homestead of many generations of the name. It was a venerable and venerated pile, rising upon the side of a hill, overlooking the wildest part of the river. The "Vancleve Chateau" was known to the whole pro- vince, and travellers never felt their time had been misspent in visiting the old mansion, and its highly cultivated grounds; while the courteous hospitality and intelligent refinement of its inmates never failed to charm, and were long remembered by the stranger. "Dry clothes-quick, Bertha-where is mother?" was the hasty inquiry of Ernest, as the house-maid answered his loud ring at the side entrance. With- out tarrying for her reply, he repaired to the nur- r  sery, where he found his mother anxiously desiring his return.  "Ernest, my son, how glad I am you have come," she said, kissing him as she spoke. "Peter was   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      1 dispatched with overcoat, and umbrella to the college, but returned, long ago, with word from  Professor Extien that you had gofie to the landing with Master Ravenscroft." ' "Yes, mother," was the reply, "'and I am soaked and chilled quite through-how delightful the stove feels." Bertha came with other clothing. "That is comfort! thank you, Bertha,"   said Ernest, as she rolled the divan near the fire. "Please, Master Ernest, take a little notice of Cassy, she has been watching you, with a hope of it, ever since you came in." "Why, my darling little sister," he exclaimed, catching her in his- arms, I have been so busy with myself, I did not even see you." "I thought you would love me, after you warmed you," lisped the now delighted little girl, returning his caresses threefold. Cassy was perfectly satisfied, and permitted herself to be taken down stairs by Ber- tha, until the others were ready for their evening meal. "What it is to have a mother-and such a mo- ther!" said Ernest, throwing his arm over her lap, as she sat on the edge of the divan, at his side. "And how grateful to a mother's heart is an affec- tionate, obedient son," and fixing her eyes upon him, she added impressively, "I expect my only son to be the prop of the remnant of my days.". "You shall never be disappointed, my precious   16     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. mother. I am fully aware of the feebleness of Adele. She told me last evening of Dr. Bryant's proposal to take her with his family to southern France, this autumn. I know mother, you feel that it would be more than my frail sister could bear-the voyage, and separation from you. The hand in which Ernest had placed his, closed  very tightly over it, and her head dropped upon his shoulder, but she spoke not. "Mother," he spoke more cheeringly, "Cassy seems to have a firm constitution, and bids fair to be a great comfort and pleasure to us all; and I faithfully promise you to endeavour to be all you desire, and to be the staff of your old age. Can I say more, mother?" "Ernest," she said at length, "I see with pain that my beautiful Adele is soon to be added to those already laid up for the resurrection. I have had much to mourn, my son; but if you could promise me with the same sincerity, that your fidelity to the Holy Mother of our Church should be as unchanging as your love and faithfulness to me, how much my many sorrows might be mitigated." The eye of Ernest fell beneath her anxious gaze. It was his turn to be silent; surprise and perplexity held him so. His mother continued-"Ernest, your father is greatly disturbed, and we have both much questioned the expediency of your intimacy with some of the young men of the Protestant department. I acknow- ledge I greatly fear their influence. Consider the   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      17 dishonour an apostasy from the Church of Rome would bring upon the noble house of Vancleve. You may not see your danger, Ernest-your father does-- H:!  Father Antoine does. If you cannot, at his confes- sional this evening, give a life-promise never to desert our Holy Church, measures will be taken to secure you against all heretic influence in future. What will be your course my son?" His mother's tears unmanned him, he wept with her. "You will promise eternal fealty to our Ma- donna. I am confident my son will do right," she whispered, laying her cheek against his forehead. "Your son will try to do the right," he said, with an effort to smile, "and try to see the right also-and pray to be led to choose the right. Can he do better than that, Lady Vancleve." He arose, clasped his arms about her neck, and. kissing her affectionately, hurried from the room. His sister was alone in the parlour. "Enjoying your imaginings, Adele!" he tried to say cheerfully, "this is .your hour for'a promenade with papa, but as he is closeted with Professor Ostend, and he is like to be weather-bound for the night, suppose you make trial of my arm as a substi- tute." "No, Ernest, you must be wearied; I can do very well, I shall not miss my walk while you talk with me." But Earnest drew the arm gently into hisi and the two slowly paced the room, while the brother confided to his sister all his troubles, only withholds     18     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. ing his fears for his friend Carl, wisely judging this shock would be too much for her sensitively nervous system. "You will be expected," she said, after she had heard the detail of his interview with his mother, "to have a conversation with our spiritual adviser-I counsel you to meet him; to be exceedingly wary; be careful not to commit yourself by a rash promise; keep your temper; make no comparisons; draw no contrasts-I dread that man; I never could like him, and wonder how father can be so blinded; but it is not for you nor I, brother, to unfold his hypocrisy; we should only draw upon ourselves the anathemas of the Church, and greatly distress our beloved parents. The exposition of his character, and of some others of Eidelberg College we must leave. I only wish some method could be Revised to show father his fea- tures in broad light." "I feel almost tempted, Adele, to throw off the yoke." "Ernest," said his sister, grasping his arm firmly, and stopping suddenly before him, "Ernest, banish such an idea, it would be madness; you forget the influence, or rather the power, Father Antoine has over our father. How long before you would find yourself an outcast from this house. Check, for my  sake, dear Ernest, all hasty impulses. Think of my lonely wretchedness, should you be sent from me. Here, we may hold sweet converse together; here, we can advise with and admonish each other; here, (and   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      19 she lowered her voice,) we can read the Scriptures together. O! be wary-think of intercepted letters --no interchange of thoughts-no kind brother to soothe my aching heart, or raise my drooping spirits." This effort was too much for the weak frame of Adele -her head sank on the bosom of her brother; he gently laid her on a sofa. When her calmness was partially restored, he resumed the subject, cautiously avoiding any exciting words. "I will see the Confessor, Adele, and for your sake, make oily concessions. I shall be expected to stop my intercourse with Philip Baden, Paul Schiller, and Carl Ravenscroft. Even this shall be promised to insure you a mind at ease. But there is the tea- bell; are you able to go to the table? I wonder if the temperature of the room is the same. Let me throw this shawl around you." He did so, and fondly kissing ler, he placed his strong arm round her, and almost carried her into the room, where the rest of the family were already gathered for the evening's repast. Comfort seemed engraven on the very walls, and the blazing, cheerful, wood fire, and plentifully pro- vided table, spoke the wealth and hospitality of the host. "We can be thankful even for this tempest, as the occasion of 'so revered a guest as Father Antoine," said Mrs. Vancleve. "Believe me, lady Vancleve, there is not a family in my diocese for whom I have greater esteem. I     20     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. grieve to see your daughter Adele looking so indis- posed this evening. Are you suffering?"He took her hand in both of his, as he spoke. "Yes," was her only reply, as Ernest seated her at the table, and then drew his little sister's high chair close to his own. Silent salutations, only, passed between him and the Professor, notwithstanding the delight this unexpected visit gave to some of the party. The conversation was not unrestrained, and, for lack of subject, he addressed himself to little Cassy. "Well, little daughter, do you love your tea?" "I love my milk in my mug, don't I, mamma?" "What else do you love?" "I love Father Antoine, mamma says so, don't I, m  mmma?" The father and mother looked delighted. Father Antoine's glance was prominently exultant. Ernest, with strong effort, checked the betrayal of the indignation he powerfully felt. Adele spoke in a clearer tone than was usual for her-"Babies and parrots express the words they are taught without the slightest idea of their import." "But the subjects of baby language," said the Professor, still exulting, "receive the sentiment of the baby's teacher, and I cannot but feel, from little Cassy's words, how I am appreciated by my much beloved friends, the Baron and Lady Vancleve." As he concluded, he bowed gracefully to each, and they assured him, in their turn, that their youngest daugh.   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERO.      21 ter had only uttered what they sincerely felt; and, added the Baron, I still trust our eldest daughter will be led to see, and acknowledge with gratitude, the necessity for the dissevering of a tie which would have brought a stain on the Papacy, and consequently on the escutcheon of the house of Vancleve. Adele is well assured she is dearer than life to her parents, but we would rather weep by the side of her tomb, far, far rather, than see her restored to health an apostate from the Church of her fathers. Fruits and cake had been placed upon the table, and the servant had withdrawn with the first course, before the Baron spoke so freely. Bertha, the confi- dential house servant and faithful nurse, only was present. As he ceased speaking, he pushed his chair back, placed his elbow on the table, and leaning his head on his hand, said very kindly to his daughter, who always sat next him, "My darling, you are so pale; how willingly would I bear every pang for you, mental and corporeal, yet probing is sometimes neces. sary." She alone heard this remark. She found it im- possible to speak, but clasped her arms about his neck as he stooped to caress her. He tried to inter- pret this action favourably. Her mother, too, hoped tremblingly. Father Antoine had gained his point. Under the mask of holy counsel, he was now bearing tyranical sway. 3     22     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. Bertha feared her young mistress might yet stray from the true Church. Ernest saw, and saw only, the tearless agony of despair. "You are fatigued, Adele, let me lead you to the sofa," he said, drawing the arm of his sister  gently within his, as she arose from the table. "When you return from the drawing-room, Er- nest," said his father, "Father Antoine will have some private conversation with you in the study." Ernest felt the hand of Adele tremble, and grasp his arm more closely. Without looking at the Con- fessor, and slightly bowing his head in answer to his father, he replied, "The presence of my parents need certainly be no interruption to any conversation be- tween Father Antoine and myself. In a few mo- ments I will be at his service in the dining-room." This was said in a tone of defiance and scorn which startled Baron Vancleve, and the dark and lowering brow of Father Antoine spoke the conflict within his bosom. A pleading look from his sister arrested Ernest, and, silently, but with flashing eye, he led her to the drawing-room. "Ernest, Ernest!" whispered she, almost gasping for breath, "will you make my cup of sorrow over- flow? Commit yourself with such as Father Antoine and you are undone; let your natural disposition shine out, and you will soon feel the venom of his sting. I am afraid to trust you with him; I must be present at the interview."   IJ HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.        23 .4   "That matter will soon be arranged," said he, ::  crossing the room rapidly, and laying his hand upon the bell-rope. "What are you doing, Ernest?" "I am going to manifest all the wisdom of the serpent," said he, forcing a smile, "by remaining at your side; and the influence of my dove-like sister may keep my hot temper a little in abeyance; but I confess since this man has interfered with your hap- piness, I with difficulty tolerate him. Wbuld I had the counsel of Gustavus."       ' "It would be the same as mine; again \I say, be wary." At this moment the door opened, and Bertha answered the summons of Ernest.  "I feared Miss Adele was not so well, and thought perhaps she wanted me." "No, Bertha, but say to my father, that Miss Adele is unwell, and requires me with her, and I should be happy to see him here, with Father Antoine and mother." "Bless his reverence," said Bertha, crossing her. self most devoutly, as she closed the door.. "Curse him, rather," muttered Ernest, in a low, smothered tone. "Did you speak, Ernest?" "Nothing for your ear, dear sister; may Heaven forgive the imprecation, it was a moment of great temptation." "Ernest!"     24     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. In a moment he was leaning over her. Looking around her fearfully, as though afraid of being overheard, she whispered, in the lowest tone, "Gustavus is here." "No!" "Yes, at the medical college." "Have you correct information?" "A note from himself. That, I suppose, is partly Father Antoine's business to-night, to warn papa against him; a spy on all that concerns us; nothing escapes his observation. Gustavus pleads for an interview." "He shall have it." "How?" "We will see. Certainly not at home, but else- where." "What! to deceive our parents?" "No! to overreach that hateful Confessor; he has father completely in his wiles; why should he have us also? Is mistaken blindness to his wishes, when under Father Antoine's guidance, to mar our happiness for ever? An interview shall be managed, Adele, though Professor Ostend bring all his wiles to to bear to contravent it; and, listen to me, sister, nay, try not to silence me, I here most solemnly vow that Gustavus Weber shall become the son-in-law of the house of Vancleve, or Ernest Vancleve will ex- pose the doings of Father Antoine, even should it lead to my expulsion from our home. At one and twenty I am my own master."   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      25 "With no property, Ernest, if out of the pale of the Holy Mother Church." "My education will be my fortune. Marry Gus. tavus, Adele, and defy Father Antoine. Must your health and happines be the forfeit of his bigotry?" Ernest spoke vehemently, and taking his sister's hand, continued, "Who is it you are rejecting? A Christ tian gentleman, a scholar, one 4f the most noble families among us. What is his mortal sin in the Confessor's eyes? Because he knows what he wor. ships, and seeks to be saved alone through his Re- deemer." "Ernest, Ernest," said his sister, taking his hands in both of hers, and pressing them closely on her temples, "my head reels, and my temples throb to bursting, at the bare suggestion. Full consent must be obtained, or I can never be the wife of Gustavus Weber. But is this your preparation for the meeting this evening? Endeavour to be calm, or he will soon entrap you. I hear footsteps, compose yourself." The door opened, and Father Antoine entered alone. "Your message was received, son Ernest, and not wishing to deprive your sister of your society, I came to gratify your wish for some private conversation with me." "I had no such desire, sir," replied Ernest, biting his lip with vexation, "but understood my father to say you had requested to see me." "I did, my son," answered he, with one of his 8*     26     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. most bland smiles. "This tempest affords me the opportunity I have long unsuccessfully sought, of conversing with the dear children of my flock confi- dentially. Some months have elapsed since you have appeared at the confessional; may I demand the reason?" Father Antoine spoke in the gentlest accent, and awaited a reply. Ernest seated himself in a chair opposite him, as he answered very calmly, "I have no other reason to offer, sir, than that I felt no wish to appear there." There was a momentary kindling in the eye of Ostend, but as suddenly suppressed, and as mildly as before, he said, "You are in error, son, straying from the only mode of obtaining salvation; are you aware of the hazard you are incurring in forsaking the spirit. ual guidance of the trained Fathers of the Church. Will our Holy Mother mediate for one who deserts her banner." "I revere the name of the blessed Madonna, whose Son is the only Mediator between God and man. She would uphold me in this sentiment." "Never! exclaimed the now thoroughly excited Confessor, "nor uphold you in your appeal from her, on leaving Eidelberg landing this evening. Has Ernest Vancleve measured his strength with the power of the Church in disobeying her mandates? far be it from my desire to denounce or anathematize a son of the noble house of Vancleve, but if you will not listen to the gentle dictation of our Holy Church, and the admonitions of your spiritual advisers, parent-   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. C     27 age must be disregarded, and you must be reclaimed by a severe course prescribed also by our unerring Fathers. I dare not shrink from the duty devolving upon me."  As he finished speaking, folding his arms, he sank back on his chair. The scornful curl upon the lip of Ernest alarmed his sister, but her imploring look checked his burst of indignation. Before uttering another sentence, he walked over to Adele, and seating himself on the sofa, laid his hand on hers, and reassuring her by a very quiet smile, he said mildly-"Whatever mea- sures may be found requisite, Professor Ostend, to secure my salvation, I will cheerfully assent to. Be cautious none are resorted to, which may hazard my seeking it in another than the Church of Rome. To many of her tenets, I still cling. At the confessional, I have been for the last time. I go only to Him who haw the words of eternal life. Do you deny Him Professor Ostend?" Ernest felt his hand pressed tightly between those of his sister, but her countenance betrayed no appre- hension. Ostend made no effort, now, to conceal his chagrin. "To your confessional, it seems I am invited," he replied, in tones of bitter irony-"Deny him! No! nor dare approach him, but through an intercessor, appointed by his holiness, the Pope." "And I," interrupted Ernest, "in obedience to his own command, go with boldness to his throne of grace; still I am not prepared to renounce the religion of my     28     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. family-it is no more than justice to allow me a fair investigation of that to which I am expected to sub- scribe, and this, I shall request of my father." The Confessor, rising, turned to Adele, and, in a low voice, said he hoped she never would be tinctured with such heretical sentiments, and bade her good night, without looking at Ernest. At a late hour, on that night, Baron Vancleve and father Antoine were seen pacing the study floor ra- pidly. The Confessor was the chief speaker, but his earnestness, and the agitation of Mr. Vancleve, showed the subject was fraught with interest to both. When parting for the night, the Confessor was heard to say, "The end always sanctifies the means, my son." "Whatever may be the termination, Father An- toine, a broken heart, or many broken hearts, will be the consequence." A low bow, and slight pressure of the hand, was the only reply, and Father Antoine retired to his chamber. Not so, Baron Vancleve. His head sought no pil. low that night, and the sun had risen far above the horizon ere he left the study.   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      29 CHAPTER II, "For the friendship of a child is the Brightest gem set upon the circle of society; A jewel worth a world of pain, A jewel seldom seen." "AN inclement night, truly, Eldrid, said Mrs. Ra- venscroft. Do you think Carl will venture his Sea Bird upon the billows?" "I cannot tell," answered'her brother, rising and looking uneasily from the casement. The wind, gathering strength every moment, howled piteously, rocking the mightiest oaks,i that' groaned and bowed under the pressure upon them; clap after clap of thunder shook the house to the cen- tre, and the vivid lightning glaring fearfully at short intervals, made the desolation without only more appa- rent. The roar of the river, on the brink of which the house was situated, made the heart of the father tremble, and at any sound resembling a human foot. step, he would eagerly throw open the casement, and endeavour to get a glimpse of something in the dis- tance. "Uncle," at length said little Elsie whose hand had been pressed into his for the last half hour "Uncle, do you think cousin Carl is on that river?" "God grant he may not be, my child, wind and tide are much against him, I trust he remained at     80     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. school this evening. No! no! he never ventured," said he, shuddering at the bare possibility; "and yet, Carl, my noble Carl, has passed his word; no bond could be more binding. I only trust, I dare nothope my boy has this once yielded." The wind lulled for a few moments, and Mr. Ra- venscroft calling Bertrand, desired him to light the dark lantern, and proceed with him to the river. A second summons was not needed, for all loved Carl Ravenscroft, and, in a moment, he appeared, wrapped in a large cloak, ready, with his master, to brave the pelting storm. "Eldrid, are you mad?" said his sister, "at least, refresh yourself with a cup of tea, before you set out. I am thankful my temperament is calmer, or rather that I have too much trust in God to allow my- self to become so much discomposed as you are at present." The admonition was, however, unheeded, for Mr. Ravenscroft, drawing an old hat closely over his ears, proceeded to the front door, followed by Bertrand, and an old faithful house dog. The door closed upon them as the last words were uttered, and Elsie, seat- ing herself upon a small cricket, buried her face in her lap and wept aloud. "Elsie, do you forget you have a mother?" "No, mother-but you are safe-but O! where, where is cousin Carl? My own cousin, whom I love so dearly-perhaps, perhaps"-and she wrung her hands in agony.   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      81 "Your cousin is a venturesome boy, Elsie, a little punishment for his temerity will not harm him, I think I shall be the greater sufferer, for my nerves are so shattered already, from this excitement, that I can scar cely hold my cup of tea. Get me the ammo- nia, Elsie." The child mechanically obeyed, without manifest- ing the slightest interest in the sufferer. "Drop it, daughter." The attempt was made, but the bottle would have fallen from her hand, had her mother not intercepted it. "What ails you child? Have you no feeling for your sick mother? Sit down at once," said; he, at the same time pouring out a cup of tea, "and take this tea, and let Carl be forgotten for a little while, in sympathy for me." At the name of Carl, Elsie was again entirely over- come. "I cannot bear to hear you talk so, mother; I do not love you, I cannot love you when you speak so of cousin Carl. Venturesome, indeed! I hope he will never change from just what he is-so sweet, so good, so like my own cousin Carl, and nobody else. Doesn't everybody love him, and praise him, and say just the things about him that I like to hear? So, mother, please hush, if you wouldn't break my heart." "Elsie Ravenscroft," exclaimed her mother, for- getting her nervousness, in anger at the temerity of the child--"Elsie Ravenscroft! take that light im- mediately, go to your chamber, and let tears of cor-     32      HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. trition wet the pillow your head rests upon, that you have been a most ungrateful child." Elsie sprung from her seat, grasped the light, and darting at her mother a look in which was mingled a indignation and sorrow, walked across the room ra. pidly, and closed the door after her so quickly, that her mother had no time to countermand an order, the injustice of which she could not help feeling, and that pressed heavily upon her conscience the moment her little girl was out of sight. The kitchen opened closely upon the sitting-room; the conversation was therefore overheard by old Ka- trine, an inmate for fifteen years of the house of Ravenscroft. Elsie was her darling; she had watched over her infancy with almost maternal solicitude, and from the time the little girl could lisp the name of Katrine, her every trouble, imaginary or real, was carried to her, and always found a sovereign baldi in the sympathy and loving kiss of her old friend, while closely nettled in her bosom. As she grew older, the heart of Katrine was often pained by the sad want of judgment shown by Mrs. Ravenscroft in her training; for Elsie's temper, naturally quick, needed a gentle guidance; and her affectionate, loving heart, almost sank under the many repulses given her by a mother, whose soul seemed so wrapped in self, that even the happiness of her little daughter was a secondary con- sideration. The work of Katrine fell from her hand as the parlour door closed upon Elsie, but she remained   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      83 sitting for a few moments, irresolute what to do. She had been sent from the presence of her mother in disgrace, any interference, therefore, would not be borne, and, under other circumstances, would not have been thought of; but the grief of Elsie for Carl, her being driven into solitude when in this agony of suspense, at a time when she required to be sustained, was more than Katrine could endure, and she deter- mined to brave every thing to give comfort to her darling child. Quietly ascending the private stair- way, she passed through the back room, and softly lifting the latch of Elsie's door, she stood beside the bed unperceived. Elsie was lying upon her face, perfectly motionless, not a sound, not a sigh escaped her; her clothes remained unchanged--even her shoes were still upon her feet. For a long time Katrine stood gazing upon her, fearing to alarm her by a movement, but the death- like stillness continuing, she became alarmed, and gently laid her hand upon her shoulder. It was un- heeded. "Elsie, dear Elsie, will you not speak to Katrine, your own Katrine? Let me turn you over, and lay your head upon my arm, where you know this precious head has so often rested. There, now, is not that more comfortable?" As she spoke, she seated herself on the side of the bed, and turning the little sufferer over, she placed a pillow on her arm) and rested her head upon it. She offered no resistance to the arrangement, and slowly raised her eyes to the speaker. -The look of 4     34     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. affection she met there, and the kiss imprinted on her cheek was too much for her. Throwing her arms around the neck of Katrine, she looked wildly around. "O, Katrine! Katrine! Carl has gone, gone, gone! for ever, for ever-gone from me for ever! the waters have closed upon him-I see him strug- gling, struggling"-and she pressed her hands closely over her eyes, as though to shut out the dreadful sight. "The waves are closing over him, I must help him! he calls me-help! help! in mercy help!" She cried so loudly, that her mother was brought to the spot in terror, and springing from the bed, the whole strength of Katrine was required to keep her from throwing herself from the window. "Let me go!" she cried fiercely, "the billows are mountain high, I shall be too late-we shall perish together!" Then, clasping her hands tightly, she remained for some moments apparently in breathless attention, and lowering her voice to almost a whisper, she said, "See, see, he rides it; he mounts above it-how he struggles with it!-he calls, he calls!"Then gasping heavily, she gave one loud wail of despair, and fell insensible upon the floor. Mrs. Ravenscroft stood transfixed; she was reaping the bitter fruits of her own selfishness. The child, her only child, lay lifeless before her-driven, per- haps, to madness, for want of a soothing word from her. Every unkindness she had ever exercised towards her passed in review before her, and the large drops standing on her forehead, and her frame   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBER;.      35 cold as marble, almost statue-like, told the agony of her mind at that moment. By Katrine, however, it was unobserved, or, at least unheeded; her whole attention was absorbed by Elsie. Lifting her upon the bed, as she would an infant, she bathed her temples and hands with vine- gar for a long time before there was any sign of returning life. At length she slowly opened her eyes, and looked wildly around. Her mother stood close beside her, watching her intensely. Leaning over her until her cheek touched her own, she gently spoke-"Elsie, my darling Elsie, can you not say one word to me?" The child turned her eye upon her for a moment, then with a most painful expression, averted it imme- diately, and sought the face of Katrine. The action was observed, and well comprehended by both, but Katrine, fearing to offend her mistress, remained silent. There was a slight tremor in the frame of Mrs. Ravenscroft, and an expression almost amount- ing to displeasure, which at any other time would, have found utterance. The silence remained un- broken for some moments, when a low murmuring sound of "Katrine" caught their ear. "What is it, Elsie? I am here beside you." "Katrine, where is my uncle? Where is-" "You mean Carl;--safely sleeping in Eidelberg, I trust, in his college chamber." "Then, is it all a dream? Is not that a storm I hear?"     36     HEIGHTS OP EIDELBERG. "Yes. But who directs the storm?" "I know that Jesus does-but I thought that Carl was in his Sea Bird, on the river." "And if he be, who is at the helm? His friend and Saviour, Elsie. Will he not be safe with him? Can he not say, 'Peace, be still,' and lull the waves in a moment?" "But will he, Katrine?" "Let us ask him, Elsie." "Ask him aloud, dear Katrine. I cannot pray." Katrine hesitated, her humility not permitting her to accede to the request; and looked towards Mrs. Ravenscroft inquiringly. She bowed acquiescence, and sinking on her knees at the head of the bed, buried her face in a pillow. The prayer was fervent, touching, and simple; as a child speaking to a parent; and as the petitions were offered for her dear child's recovery, the resto- ration of Carl, and the safe return of her master and husband, Mrs. Ravenscroft's head sank low, her spirit was humbled, and she wept many and bitter tears. As they arose from their knees, the faint voice of Elsie was again heard inquiring for Katrine. She was by her side in a moment. "I want water, Katrine, my throat is parched, and I want to lie upon my pillows on your arm." "Can I do nothing for you, Elsie?" inquired her mother, faintly, and rather averting her face from her as she spoke. The same dissatisfied lock came over the counte-   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      37 nance of Elsie, and her eyes closed as though she desired to shut out an unpleasant object. "I think some nitre will be required," said Ka- trine, anxious to change the course of Mrs. Ravens- croft's thoughts, and relieve her own embarrassment, "have wh it in the chest?" "We have, Katrine, I will get it for you; but Dr. Baden must be sent for as soon as we can obtain a messenger. Bertrand must soon come home, but he will be worn out, and scarcely able to travel two miles further." "Husband will little heed that, when Elsie needs his services. During the long sickness of our little Nanny, the kindness of her young mistress to her went to the heart of Bertrand, and he often sits and talks about her, and wonders whether there ever was any thing so-good, so kind, except it may be master Carl himself. I wish he was only here, it is waxing late, and the little girl needs help-more than we can give her." "Do you feel uneasy Katrine? Her pulse is not a- high one." "No-but her skin is very feverish, and her head so hot, I can scarcely bare my hand upon it. The low pulse tokens no good, it only shows weakness; the feet in a mustard bath might do her good." "I will get the water, do you remain with Elsie." Elsie lay with her eyes dlosed, apparently noticing nothing; a low moan at intervals escaped her, and a slight shivering of the frame occasioned much anxiety 4*     38     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. to Katrine. The water was brought, her feet placed in it, with a blanket wrapped closely around her. When again laid upon the bed, she sank into a deep sleep, and Mrs. Ravenscroft and Katrine sat quietly beside her. The wind was still howling piteously when Mr. Ravenscroft and Bertrand gained the water's edge. "Give me your arm, Bertrand," said his master, "it will be impossible to keep our footing singly. Raise your light higher, that its rays may be seen in the distance, while I sound the horn, if perchance its tones may reach the ear of any in this tempestuous night." Again and again he attempted to make the name of Carl Ravenscroft resound, with a strength of voice, that in the stillness of a summer's night might have been readily heard on the heights of Eidelberg, but which was like a whisper amidst the crashing of the elements, that seemed as if all nature would be dissevered. At one moment they were surrounded with the blackness of darkness, and they found it impossible to grope their way; the next, a sheet of flame enveloped them. The rain fell in torrents, and the cloak of Bertrand, torn from him by the power of the wind, was whirled into the air, and soon lost sight of. For two miles they continued along the borders of the river. They stopped before a high rock, overhanging the river, at its entrance into the bay. "Point Rock is the favourite landing place of   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      39 Carl," remarked his father, "let us ascend it, and throw the light upon the waters." "It would be madness for you, sir," replied Ber- trand; "a sailor in my younger days, I can keep my footing more firmly. Let me go alone." "Not so; any risk you may incur for my boy, I must share with you. He who holdeth the winds in his fists is my strong refuge. But the waters have come in unto my soul, Bertrand, I fear not any out- ward danger." The ascent was not only dangerous, but almost im- practicable on such a night; but strength of nerve, and firm purpose accomplished what seemed impos- sible. The lantern of Betrand was firmly planted on the summit, the case being secured in a cleft of the rock, while the light streamed far down into the bqy. Mr. Ravenscroft made little progress, his feet slip- ping at every step, the wind constantly throwing him backward, and obliging him to retrace his steps. On arriving at the top, Bertand, cautiously lying down, leaned over its brink to scan the river, and see, if possible, whether any life was in jeopardy upon its bosom. He looked intently for a long time, until his eye became accustomed to the lurid appear- ance; .he could then, by the help of a small spy-glass he had with him, discern objects slightly, Seeing nothing, he was about giving up the search as hope- less, when a small speck apparently. moving on the waters caught his attention. He held his breath, and brought his head still lower, watching withlsuch     40     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. intense interest, that he did not hear the footsteps of his master, who had at length succeeded in getting beside him. Lower and lower sank his head, while Mr. Ravenscroft, unnoticed, watched his motions. The next moment, springing up, in a stentorian voice, which thrilled through every nerve of Mr. Ravenscroft, he shouted, "Carl, Carl, we will be with you-hold, hold on; steer north if possible, or you are gone! I am Bertrand-hold on, hold on!" The shout was answered, and a cry of "Help, help!" was faintly heard by Mr. Ravenscroft. Bertrand, springing down the rock as though there were 1o dangers to intercept him, reached its base in a moment of time, stood for an instant on the shore, and hearing the cry reiterated of "Help, help!" seized a long rope that was fastened by a ring to the rock, threw himself into the bay, and was in a short time beside a little boat, from which the sound proceeded. "You are safe, dear Carl, God be thanked!" cried Bertrand, with much emotion, "my rope will bring us both safely to land." "For heaven's sake, help!" screamed a voice en- tirely unknown to Bertrand; O! save me, save me!" Springing into the boat, to the great astonishment of the little peasant who was in it, by the aid of the rope he soon drew to shore, and landed him safely upon it. "What, and who are you, and what are you doing here?" said Bertrand impatiently, almost sick with disappointment. ,  N   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      41 "Oney fishing in the boat tied to shore; the wind tuk it and driv'd it from its moorings, and I couldn't git to land. Mammy was sick and hungry, so I had a mind to ketch her a fish for her breakfast when she waked, sir, for I'm all she's got in the world to do for her. She lives jist by here, in that red house; she's Katy Spitskorf, and I am Galen Spitskorf; and if you'll be so good as to call, sir, she would know bet- ter how to thank you-better than I do-much, sir. Yes! she'll pour down thanks and blessings, many, upon you, sir. But I'll jist run home now, for she must be a dyin' with fright about me. Good night, sir, and blessings on you for ever." So saying, the little fellow ran off, and was out of sight in a moment. At the cry for help, Mr. Ravenscroft attempted to lift his horn in answer, but his hand and voice refused to do their office, his knees smote together, and he remained almost motionless for a few moments, but the cry again meeting his ear, he started to his feet, and sliding, rather than walking down the rock, arrived just in time to see the rope seized by Bert- rand, and hear the plunge. He awaited in breathless agony the result; the few moments that elapsed seemed ages, and, forgetful of every thing but Carl's danger, the tempest was disregarded,-and uncon- sciously throwing his coat back from a sense of op- pression, stood with clasped hands awaiting the issue. That any other than Carl was in-the boat had never entered the mind of either Bertrand or himself; anrd when the boat actually neared, and he saw two figures t     42     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. coming to shore, he sank down, and unable to utter a syllable, buried his face in his hands and wept aloud. The words of Bertrand, however, soon disabused his mind, and almost stricken to the earth with the heavy disappointment, took the arm of Bertrand, and slowly proceeded to his home. Elsie slept long and heavily, and Katrine, knowing that her master and husband would need a change of warm clothing on their return, quietly slipped away, and placing several logs on the kitchen hearth, the whole length of the long chimney, soon made a crackling fire, which lighted and warmed every cor- ner of the room. A kettle was soon boiling for a cup of tea, and a small table placed, with some eat- ables upon it. Katrine then replenished with wood the old Dutch ten-plate in Mr. Ravenscroft's room, to which was attached a drum, placed in the chamber above, occupied by Bertrand and herself. She then proceeded to lay out clothes for both in their respect- ive rooms. Warm flannels and other articles of under-clothing were hung round the stove, and thor- oughly aired for them on their return. Having com- pleted all her preparations, she sat down before the kitchen fire, impatiently awaiting them. Again and again she scanned the clock, thinking it had surely stopped; time appeared to her to have leaden wings. Nine-ten-eleven came, and Katrine's anx- iety becoming uncontrollable, she arose and opened the front door to listen for any tidings of them. See- ing nothing, and shrinking with terror from the terrific J   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      43 storm, she was about closing the door, when it was gently pushed open, and Bertrand made his appear- ance, followed by Mr. Ravenscroft. Katrine was about making an exclamation, when Bertrand pre- vented her by raising his finger to his lips, and shak- ing his head. Then taking his master by the arm, he silently led the way to the kitchen. "Change your clothes quickly, Bertrand," whis- pered his wife, "you are drenched." "Time enough for that, Katrine, Mr. Ravenscroft must be our first care."  Katrine assisted him in removing the overcoat, which was dripping wet, and Bertrand observed for the first time, that his head was uncovered, of which Mr. Ravenscroft seemed quite unconscious. "Give me your overshoes, Mr. Ravenscroft, I will dry them here with the overcoat, and you will find everything else above ready for you. I have prepared a cup of tea for you, sir, added she, at the same time pouring it out for him, you will please take it lefore you go up stairs." "Thank you, good Katrine," replied he, "you always more than anticipate my every want." "A small piece of toast?" said she inquiringly. He shook his head, and with difficulty swallowing the tea, he advanced to the door. The low and tremulous voice in which he spoke, went to the heart of the warm-hearted Katrine, and difference of rank, only restrained her from manifesting her sympathy by outward expression. After lighting him to his     "    BHEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. room door, she stepped in to take a look at Elsie, whom she found still sleeping; closing the door softly, she again returned to the kitchen, and Bertrand, after putting on a dry suit, soon rejoined her there. He found her weeping bitterly. "Was ever any one so desolate, Bertrand, as our dear Master. If Carl has gone, what has he left?" "Carl has not gone,' answered Bertrand, huskily, "he will be saved, I know it; it cannot be that such a stroke should come upon one as good as our dominie. He does not need it, and God does nothing in vain." "Whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth, replied Katrine." "I tell you, Katrine," said Bertrand, laying down the piece of toast he was in vain endeavouring to eat, "our boy will be found; Mr. Ravenscroft will not be broken-hearted, there would be no mercy in i--it would be cruelty, injustice, contrary to the dealings of the Most High," and springing up, he strode the floor hastily. "Bertrand, Bertrand," said Katrine solemnly, "do you impugn the justice of the Almighty. Do you call evil good, and good evil? Whose hand removed our sweet little ones, putting them out of our sight? who took our cottage from us, and placed us in this subordinate situation; was it injustice husband? or was it for some wise purpose? No! clouds and dark. ness surround his throne, but we know that he is a God full of all compassion, and plenteous in mercy." As Katrine spoke, the head of Bertrand sank upon   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      45 his breast, and the big tears coursed down his weather- beaten cheek; "I have spoken unadvisedly, without knowledge, forgive me, O Lord, and remember thy- tender mercies and thy loving-kindness." "You had no tidings of Carl?" "No, we heard the cry of distress, and thinking only of Carl, we made every effort to rescue him; but it was only a little urchin named Galen Spitskorf." "No! not little Galen!-why, he is the wonder of his neighbourhood. Although only ten years old, his sick mother is entirely maintained by him, and she is so wrapped tU in him, that her eye glistens at the bare mention of his name. Was his life in danger? Right glad am I that he is saved, and the poor widow saved such sorrow; it has been a hard but a good night's work, Bertrand. Carl Ravenscroft thinks the world of him, and often takes him fishing in his little boat; he gave him a line and hooks, and with it he provides his mother many a meal." "I am sorry I spoke impatiently to him, said Bertrand, "but my disappointment was so great at seeing a stranger, that I forgot myself." "I wish everybody would forget themselves, but not quite in the same way either," replied Katrine. "If Mrs. Ravenscroft had forgotten herself this even- ing, little Elsie would not have been brought so low this night." "Elsie, little Elsie ill!" exclaimed Bertrand-. "Who is with her?" "Her mother." 5    -     "     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "Such a nurse, and one not loved by Elsie; had you not better go to her?" "She is sleeping, and does not need me." "Tell me all about it Katrine." The whole sad tale was recounted. During the recital, Bertrand several times wiped his brow, some- times from indignation, sometimes from sorrow; Then starting up, he looked around for his hat, which Ka- trine was drying. "Where are you going, Bertrand?" "We must have the Doctor here to-night," he re- plied, "to-morrow may be too late." "Not so, husband; if you were in a situation to go, it would be a stormy night to bring out Dr. Baden. Besides, she is now sleeping, and would only be dis- turbed." "I wish the child were ours, Katrine. Even in our humble walk, she would be much happier than with that widowed mother. Had her father lived, how different would have been the training of little Elsie; he was a noble man-he married, they say, for beauty; he must have sorely rued it. Her haughty selfishness has sometimes almost made me think of leaving, until I remembered all the other inmates- for that stamp of the foot, and sirrah, is almost too much for mortal man to bear." "Yes, how different from the mother of our Carl, she was so gentle, so kind, so thoughtful of the wants of every one; when our dear children died, was she not more like a near relative than a mistress.

'The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away,' can yoi not say, blessed be his name? "What a mighty change came over her the last four years of her life, a sore Papist she was before." "Yes, Bertrand, I have often wondered how Mr. Ravenscroft came to marry a Romanist." "I can tell you; I heard the whole story from Carl, who was pleasantly relating it to Ernest Vancleve, to show, he said, his romantic birth. When only fifteen, Mr. Ravenscroft was sent to the College of Heidelberg, in Switzerland; there he remained three years entirely under the influence of the Romish Church; a private tutor was then provided for him, also a Roman Catholic, and he set out to make the tour of Europe, his father, hoping his son would gain much from personal observation; many letters of introduction were obtained for him, among others one for Don Juan Cabriella of Valladolid, was given him by Monsieur Bossuet, a Professor in the College. It was presented, and an invitation to dinner followed. He there became fascinated with Miss Estelle Cabriella, the only daughter of the proud and bigoted Castilian. Day after day passed, each finding him still at Valla- dolid, a daily visitor at the house of- Don Juan. His tutor in vain urged him to proceed, and becoming anxious, at length wrote to his father to inform him     48     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. of his suspicion. But it was anticipated by young Ravenscroft himself, who, always in the habit of con- fiding in his mother, had opened his whole heart to her by letter. He confessed that he had wooed and won the lovely daughter of Cabriella, and nothing was now wanting but the consent of the parents of both par- ties to their union. Don Juan raved and swore at the temerity of a heretic's seeking the hand of his daughter, but finding her immovable, and being entirely unused to crossing her, he finally gave his consent. He was also somewhat mollified, by receiving letters speaking in the highest terms of the young man's attainments, and respectability of family, &c.; and Professor Bos- suet confidentially assured him that no means would be left untried to bring him into the only Church. The parents of Mr. Ravenscroft were much distressed, but knowing the happiness of their son was involved, yielded their consent also. The family of Cabriella had long been well known to them as one of the first in Valladolid; on that score, therefore, there was no objection.. After six months sojourn in Valladolid, the union was consummated, and the beautiful bride found a home in the homestead of Eldrid, and became the loving and loved daughter of his parents. The conversion of Eldrid took place two years after, when he was just twenty-one, and in four years from that time, he was a preacher of the gospel, and settled in this church. Much as he loved his Estelle, there was a sad want of fellowship between them; but she was given to his prayers, and was converted one year   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      49 after they came to this place. For four years she was truly a shining light, remarked Carl, she was then taken from us, when I was only six, just ten years since. I remember it as though it were yester- day, the little hymns, and texts of Scripture she taught me; and her last words to me have made an indelible impression. Too weak to rise from her bed, she desired that I would sit upon it near her. I did so, feeling very sad to see her pale face, and hear her'speak so feebly." Carl, my little son," said she, "I am about leav- ing you to go to Jesus, then I shall be well and happy, no pain can ever come near me again." "Take me with you, mamma," I replied, over- whelmed with sorrow, "I cannot have you leave me." "I will, my little boy, but not just now. Put all your trust in Jesus-he loves little children, and says, 'Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not.' Go right to Jesus with all your troubles and all your sins, and let no one teach you that any one else in heaven can hear your prayers." Then putting my hands together within her own, she formed a little prayer that went straight to my heart, and I believe was heard in heaven for me, for, from that time, the Bible was my daily companion, and I never rested until I could say, the Lord is mine, and I am his.  "I had an opportunity of hearing the whole story, as Carl had taken me out in his new boat, to get my opinion of its merits, and Ernest accompanied us." 5*     50     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. The effect on Ernest's mind was very visible, for towards the conclusion I saw a tear steal down his cheek, which he hastily brushed away and endea- voured to hide. There was no word of reproof to Carl, or no word of another intercessor than the Re- deemer." "A noble young gentleman he is," replied Katrine, "may the Spirit show him that great Intercessor as he is-the scales must fall from his eyes some time. But, Bertrand, it is twelve o'clock; you must be very tired, go to rest, I will not keep you up'another moment." Bertrand retired to his chamber, and Katrine, after arranging the lights and fire for the night, stole softly to the bedside of Elsie. She was not sleeping, but tossing restlessly upon her pillow. Her fever had risen greatly, her cheek was flushed, and her eye had assumed an unnatural brightness. Her mother had thrown herself upon the lounge, and was soundly sleeping. Of the presence of Katrine she appeared entirely unconscious, and a little incoherent raving was all the answer returned to her caresses. Shocked beyond measure at the unexpected change, Katrine stood for some moments, irresolute what steps to take. The tempest was still raging, Dr. Baden could not be thought of until morning. The use of mustard occurred to her, and slipping quietly down stairs she soon returned with two plasters, which she placed upon the ankles of the child. She then sat down, anxiously awaiting the result. Hour after hour   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     51 passed; the mustard had drawn, and was removed, but no change for the better was apparent. At length the dawn appeared, and Katrine, ascending to Bertrand's room, found him already dressed, and about starting for the Doctor. Saddling Mr. Ravens- croft's horse for Dr. Baden, he in a few moments was on his way for him, intending to return himself on foot. Mrs. Ravenscroft had slept but little, and was slowly pacing the room, her eyes bent upon the floor, apparently noticing nothing. Upon hearing the voice of Mr. Ravepscroft, however, she opened the door and went to meet him. "Is there not an unusual bustle in the house, Annette? Has anything new occurred?" "Elsie is ill, very ill; Dr. Baden is sent for." "Who has gone?" "Bertrand," C"Where is Katrine?" "With Elsie." "Always at her post; she is in good hands. I must see my darling Elsie. God  ant she may be spared us."  Katrine rose at the entrance of her master, and Mrs. Ravenscroft observed, for the first time, that she had not changed her dress from the day before, and remembered that her head had not pressed a pillow that night. Selfish as her nature was, for a moment she was touched with a feeling of gratitude that her child should have been the object of so much     52     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. solicitude, yet even that thought rather increased the jealousy she had always felt for Katrine. The devoted affection of Elsie for her had been very galling to Mrs. Ravenscroft, and she had witnessed that night the wide difference in Elsie's feelings for herself. Jealousy and bad feeling strove with gratitude for some time; at length the former gained the preemi- nence, and she made no remark on her disturbed night, but throwing herself moodily upon the divan, she rested her head upon the cushion. "Elsie," said her uncle, taking her burning hand in his, "Elsie, do you not know me? Speak, dear Elsie, will you not?" Elsie fixed her eye upon him with a look so intent, that Mr. Ravenscroft almost shrank from it. The unnatural brilliancy of the eye gave it a startling appearance, and the steady gaze, so immovable, so fixed, obliged him at length to close his own, to shut it out from view. Leaning over her he kissed her forehead. Starting from her pillow, she threw her arms about him and almost shrieked, O! Carl, dear Carl, have you come to me? I saved you, I saved you. Did the waters swallow you up? Did you struggle with the billows? Did you ride the waves? The waves-look, look, they rise-rise mountain high! I must go, I can save him! let me go, let me go!" she shrieked. "Yes, yes, I am coming Carl, coming-will you keep me? will you be the death of Carl? You will not, cannot, shall not hold me; help, help!"   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      53 Mr. Ravenscroft, weakened from the night's ex- citement, in vain endeavoured to retain her. Fever had given her immense strength, and throwing him from her as she would a child, she sprang out of bed, seized a chair, and the next moment one of the win- dows was crashed to atoms.  The effort was too great, her strength was exhausted, and sinking back into the arms of Katrine, she suffered herself to be lifted on the bed, and lay motioless for a long time. The scene was too much fof Mr. Ravenscroft; his whole frame shook with emotion, and clasping his hands together, he wept aloud. The sound of the trampling of a horse in the court- yard below, roused him, and rising, he met Dr. Baden at the chamber door. A warm, earnest pressure of the hand was all the greeting that passed between them, and Mr. Ravenscroft, unable to restrain his feelings, withdrew to his own chamber. The Doctor stood long beside the bed of Elsie, holding the pulse of the little sufferer, then turning, with a sad countenance, he seated himself beside Mrs. Ravenscroft. ' What do you think of her, Doctor?" ' There has been too powerful excitement for that nervous little frame to endure; it has gone to the brain; but the cause is still acting, and medicineS will do but little. She must be watched, closely watched, paroxysms of frenzy will intervene between the typhoid symptoms. Carl's name must not be     54     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. mentioned, and every precaution taken to avoid ex- citement." "Has she much fever, Doctor?" asked Katrine. "All its tendency is to the brain, her pulse is low, and system prostrated; her hair must be removed, and ice applied to the head." "Not taken off!" exclaimed her mother; "those beautiful chestnut ringlets-they are her chief pride and beauty." "There is no alternative, Mrs. Ravenscroft, her life is in imminent danger, we must resort to strenuous measures at once. It is our only hope." "O! Doctor, how can you be so incautious? you have unfitted me for nursing my child, my nerves are so unstrung at best." "Take a little valerian, madam," said the Doctor, coldly, "and let Katrine, who has stronger nerves, receive my directions." "Katrine has not the same reason for being nerv- ous," she replied, bursting into a flood of tears, occa- sioned rather by displeasure than sorrow; "the feel- ings of a mother are to be considered." "And none more willing to consider them than myself, but the child must be our first care-self must be put out of view. I will just step down and fie my horse, and will return in a few moments." "Where is Bertrand, Katrine?" asked Mrs. Ra- venscroft; " let him take care of the horse." "Bertrand, finding I would not need his horse, continued his way, five miles farther for Mrs. Van-   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      55 doren, supposing-and supposing with some reason, her services would be needed here." Mrs. Ravenscroft's eye flashed. 'Who gave Ber- trand any such direction?" said she, turning to Katrine. "I only wished she were here, and was planning. with him the best means of getting her a message," was the answer. "When servants act without orders," replied Mrs. Ravenscroft, haughtily, they go beyond their pro- vince. "Neither Bertrand nor you know your place as you should do. You have been spoiled by too much condescension. I shall have Bertrand return immediately and say that aunt Meggy's services are not needed. She is an officious woman, and would interfere, as she always does, in matters that do not concern her. Mr. Ravenscroft is perfectly blind to his sister's assumption. I believe, indeed, he thinks she is perfection. She has managed also, to wind herself around the heart of little Elsie, so that my presence is of no moment when she is here." "Compose yourself, my dear Mrs. Ravenscroft," said the Doctor, gently taking her hand in his, and leading her into a small room adjoining, "I fear there is almost too much bustle for my little patient. Could you not lie down, and rest here a little while, the fatigue of the night has been too much for you, many more must be passed through before Elsie is well, and you have need of the assistance of your friends in this extremity. Remain here, and Katrine     56     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. will assist me in placing the ice on her head. I will return, and we can then commend the little one to Him who watches the fall of a sparrow-to one who loves her far better than any earthly parent." Mrs. Ravenscroft silently and sullenly obeyed; and seating herself in a large arm chair, which the Doctor, finding her unwilling to lie down, had placed for her, gave way to the most intense fit of weeping, and had scarcely composed herself, when Dr. Baden returned, followed by Mr. Ravenscroft. The meek submission manifested in his counte- nance, presented a strong contrast to the proud curl on the lip of his sister, although the deepest sorrow was depicted in his pallid face and trembling lip, not a murmuring word escaped him-he gently bowed his head to the storm; he remembered the Lord's promise, "I will be with him in trouble," and, at a throne of grace, through the night, he had plead many precious promises, and entered into a fresh covenant with his Maker. Not so, Mrs. Ravenscroft. Mrs. Vandoren was still the prominent thought, and she was trying to devise some means of preventing the contemplated visit. For Elsie she had but little maternal feeling, there never had been any affinity between them, and the authority she attempted to exercise as a mother's right, was not recognized by her little daughter. Passionate in the extreme, she would punish without cause, and had not sufficient control over herself to command even the respect of Elsie.   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      57 "Elsie is sleeping," said the Doctor, addressing himself to Mrs. Ravenscroft, "and I trust, in awak- ing, she will be more comfortable. 'Before I leave you, shall we unite in prayer for her, and, lowering his voice, for the safe return of dear Carl also?" They knelt; a prayer was offered that even touched the heart of Mrs. Ravenscroft. When they arose, her haughty air had given place to one more suited to her present circumstances, and her kind reception of aunt Meggy, who entered the room as Dr. Baden left it, showed at least a temporary change in her feel- ings. "How is Elsie now, Annette?" asked Mrs. Van- doren, extending her hand kindly to her. "The Doctor thinks her somewhat more comfort- able; she is now sleeping." ' "I am glad you sent for me; I can stay now with perfect convenience. Cassy has vacation, she can keep house for me." ".Dear sister," exclaimed Mr. Ravenscroft, em- bracing her most tenderly, " the Lord has surely sent you to me; how came you here so opportunely?" "Bertrand came for me, and harnessed his horse to my little carriage." "Where is he now?" "When I came up, Katrine was preparing break- fast for him, which he would scarcely wait to eat, so anxious was he to get over to Eidelberg Heights if possible; but the river is so swollen, it will be im- practicable." 6     58     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "May the Lord reward him for all his kindness to me and mine, his services I can never repay. His love for my dear son leads him to great self-denial, and he would now be willing even to hazard his life for him. I would like him to come to me before he leaves the house, I will caution him not to run into dagger." "I will see him," said his sister, rising, "and men- tion your anxiety to him." The door closed, and Mrs. Ravenscroft was left alone with her brother. Her better feelings, which were generally like the morning cloud, and early dew, had all subsided; the praise of Bertrand, and the prospect of a long visit from Mrs. Vandoren had operated unfavourably on her naturally irritable tem- perament. "I wonder," she said tartly, "for what purpose I am here-for a puppet, for an automaton-while she is to be the active principle to guide all things, pull- ing the strings, and having the whole house dance at her bidding-turning everything up side down-giv- ing servants rule, and making those who should have the government of no account." Mr. Ravenscroft started, and looked towards her inquiringly, as though he had mistaken her meaning, and desired to be confirmed in this opinion. She continued, "Mrs. Vandoren had better occupy this house. My child and I can seek a home else- where. She will be in no danger of loneliness, even   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      59 when you are out, and Cassy is at school, as our ser- vants are her boon companions." "Annette Ravenscroft!" replied her brother, stern- ly, "'by what principle are you actuated that you should manifest so evil a spirit in this time of over- whelming sorrow, when God has laid his hand so heavily upon us. Would you were like my sister, her deep-toned piety, her gentleness and kindness win the love of all who know her, and in the dislike you feel for her, you stand alone. As to the servants of whom you speak, I view them in the light of friends; their warm hearts, and kind offices would make them so, had they always held a servile station, which you know they have not. Educated and re- fined, by the providences of God, by sickness and poverty, they were obliged to seek a livelihood in any manner they could obtain it; but true, tried friends they are, and will always find a shelter in my house, while I have a roof I can call my own." His voice rose, as he spoke, and becoming more and more vehe- ment, he added, "Neither shall my sister be an exile from this roof, Annette Ravenscroft, until my head is pillowed with the sod, and my spirit takes its flight to another home." As he finished speaking, he left the room, and retired to his own chamber. Mrs. Ravenscroft listenened to the end; astonish- ment, mingled with rage and indignation, held her speechless; it was the first time she had ever seen him evince any but the meekest spirit. Her first impulse was to follow him, to tax him with injustice,     60  i   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. and trifling with her feelings, at a time of so much sorrow, when her child, her only child, was ill, per- haps to be removed from her for ever. Before she had quite resolved how to act, Mrs. Vandoren returned, and finding her in a state of great excitement, asked the cause. ' Ask your brother the cause," replied she, haugh- tily, "I presume I need not submit to be catechised by Mrs. Vandoren." "Certainly not, Annette, pardon me for seeming to intrude upon you; seeing your excited appearance, I feared Elsie was worse;" then placing her hand gently on her shoulder, she added-"Let us be friends, Annette; we kneel at the same altar; wor- ship the same Saviour; and look forward to the same home which that friend of sinners has prepared for those who love him. May the Lord prepare us both for those blessed mansions. I will now go in and sit with Elsie; Katrine can then attend to house matters, while you rest after the fatigues of the night; by this time, the ice probably requires renewing. Mrs. Ravenscroft did not answer, and Mrs. Vap- doren, leaving her, went into the chamber of Elsie, whom she found still sleeping; but the ice having melted, the bladder was refilled, and gently replaced upon her head, without disturbing her. The door was partly open leading to her brother's chamber, and stepping in, she found him walking the floor hurriedly. "Bertrand had gone, Eldrid, before I had time to   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      61 see him," said she. "Katrine said he had little hope of effecting a passage across the Niese, but I feel con- fident Carl is at thq College." "On what grounds, Meggy? He has often crossed when the clouds have been as lowering, and the waves as high as they were at five o'clock last evening-and his word he considers so sacred. He is in the hands of a kind Saviour, whatever is his will, may I have strength to say Amen." "I feel he will be returned to us, Eldrid, even had he ventured upon the waters; how many vessels are constantly sailing down the bay, that might render him assistance." "You always have a word of encouragement, dear Meggy; when I have you with me, I feel that I can bear trial better; but, where is Annette?" "Where you left her." "I have a sad conscience, sister; I gave way to evil temper; I took matters in my own hands, and said many things which I feel were wrong. I must go and tell Annette so, whatejer it may cost me." "Tell Annette! She will not appreciate it." "That matters not; I will do my duty, and relieve my conscience." Mrs. Vandoren sat beside the bed of Elsie, while her brother proceeded to the room of Annette. She was evidently about waking, her head turned several times upon the pillow, and her eyes slowly opened. Fixing them upon her aunt for a moment, her whole 6*     62     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. face lighted with pleasure, and laying her hand upon hers, she attempted to speak, but in a few momentt she was again entirely unconscious, apparently wrap- ped in a deep sleep. Mr. Ravenscroft soon returned, and his sister joined him in his chamber. His face was flushed, and it was with difficulty he succeeded in hiding his displeasure. His sister mide no remark on what was nearest his heart at that moment, but spoke of Elsie and her momentary consciousness, in this way ching- ing the current of his present feelings. "How unlike her mother is Elsie," remarked Mr. Ravenscroft, "I have often thought it was an evil hour that I invited Annette to make this house her home; yet when I think of Elsie, I can scarcely regret it." "No, Eldrid, for the child's sake you were pro- bably led to propose it. Of what advantage the ex- ample of Carl has been to her, and how often has he checked her when manifesting indignation 'at her mother, and led her to better feeling, the reflection of his noble traits are now plainly seen in her. What was she when she came here?-a passionate, self-willed, little girl; affectionate, indeed, but gov- erned entirely by caprice. Now, her whole character has changed; she has, indeed, but little affection for her mother, that is unfortunate, but it could not be otherwise, such government could never win. Ka- trine has taken her mother's place, and Annette feels   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      63 it; that is the ground of her dislike to that good woman." "It may be also the origin of her alienation from you, Meggy, for when Elsie hears you are coming here to spend any time, her joy knows no bounds. 'I do think,' said she, the other day, in the presence of her mother, 'that aunt Meggy is better and sweeter than any body else, except Katrine.' A look from her mother told her displeasure. Carl, unfortu- nately, was not there to keep her in order. 'Why, mamma,' replied she, answering to her dark counte- nance, 'I am sure I should love you better than any of them, if you were just like them.' A supper- less bed, that night, was poor Elsie's reward for her frankness." "Poor Annette was a spoiled child of fortune, Eldrid, we must think of that-her will was a law to her foolishly indulgent parents, her beauty was their pride, and her education consisted in a few useless accomplishments, that would enable her to shine in gay society. Of moral training, they knew but little. It was a wonder, Frederick, with his intellect, should have been fascinated with'mere beauty; he confessed to me that he was much deceived in her character. How did she get into the church, brother? Was she not rather tinctured with Romanism, the religion of her parents?" I think not. But I fear a change of heart was never experienced by Annette; affliction for the"      "     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. death of her husband was mistaken by the session and myself for sorrow for sin, and we received her, believing her to be a truly contrite spirit. I have several times advised her to abstain from the com- munion, but the manner in which she received such a suggestion only shows more fully her unfitness for the ordinance. I confess I am at a great loss what to do." A gentle tap at the door interrupted the conversa- tion, and Bertrand entered, looking haggard with fatigue and disappointment. "I have tried in vain, Mr. Ravenscroft, to find a place to effect a passage. The river is tremendously swollen, and the waters are rushing to the bay with such terrific violence that no boat could possibly be managed." The heart of Mr. Ravenscroft sank in a moment; his thoughts had been diverted For a little while from Carl's danger. His sister had purposely led him into another train. "I believe Mr. Carl is at Eidelberg, sir, and to- morrow I am sure we can get over." "Let us trust, brother, and wait with patience the result. I almost feel to-morrow will bring him to us, filled with his usual life and animation." "I cannot tell what there is about you, Meggy, that always reassures me. When with you, I lose that sense of desolation I otherwise should feel-and good Bertrand, my own friend, not servant," said he, - .   l   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      65 grasping his hand affectionately, "how shall I ever repay you for all the interest you have shown in my dear boy." Bertrand attempted to speak, but could not, and returning the warm pressure of his master's hand, he hurriedly left the room.  CHAPTER III. "Still, mind is up, and stirring, And pryeth in the corners of contrivance, Often from the dark recesses, Picking out bright seeds of truth." EARLY dawn found Ernest at his chamber window, contemplating the effects of the last night's hurri- cane. The storm was hushed, and the moaning winds entirely stilled, but the devastation that met his, view on every side was fearful; huge branches of trees, torn from their trunks which had been tossing to and fro, were now rapidly floating over the dark waters towards the bay. The Niese had risen to an incredible height-a terrace at the south end of the garden had been washed away, the piers of the old bridge were entirely covered, rocks were shaken from their base, and stood leaning over the flood. The ris- ing'sun added magnificence to the awful sublimity of nature's wild picture-the bold romantic spirit of the     "     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. German youth glowed with rapture as he stood with folded arms watching the king of day gilding as with  his sceptre the hill-tops as far as the eye could reach, all the foliage glittered in his radiance, even the crests of the rushing billows sparkled in his smile, the whole soul of Ernest was absorbed in the sublimity of the scene; but suddenly clasping his hands to- gether, he exclaimed, "Where is Carl!" and he turned from the casement with the "heart sickness of hope deferred." An unmistakeable pounding at the door, turned his thoughts into a more pleasant channel; his little sister's method of gaining an entrance, was soon re- sponded to. "Come, brother, quick, or Father Antoine will be gone without your seeing him," said the child in eager  haste. "And all these birds will be gone, if you do not stay now to see them," he replied, and lifting her into the window seat, he drew her attention to the inhabitants of their own aviary, that his father was accustomed to liberate every morning a few hours. Ernest gave a peculiar whistle, familiar to the birds, which, brought a number clustering around them. Cassy danced with delight, as they alighted upon her brother's fingers, and he threw them on her arms and head; they seemed to be warbling a welcome to the beautiful sunlight, as they flew from tree to tree, and returned constantly to the casement.   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      67 'Put one of them on this, brother," said Cassy holding up a-small jet cross suspended by a dark rib- bon from her neck. Ernest did so. "My little sister is quite dressed," he remarked with a forced laugh, "'what is this?" "A cross, brother-Father Antoine gave me it, I must kiss it three times a day, and say my prayers to it every morning, Father Antoine says so-have you one, brother?" "Yes, dear, but I carry mine inside." "O take it out and let me see it," said the child eagerly, "let me have it in my own hand." "It is almost too heavy for me, dear, you could not hold it; perhaps when you are older, some day I may trust you with it-but. see, the birds have flown home, Bertha has called them to their break- fast." "And ours is ready for us, the bell rang ten min- utes since," said Adele, entering softly; she stooped to caress Gassy whose arms were extended to receive her. Bertha stopped at the door for the child, and Ernest giving his arm to Adele, they repaired to the breakfast room. Lady Vancleve only was there. "Good morning, mamma," said Ernest, 'I was afraid I should forfeit my kiss by my tardiness, but I am not the latest, where is father?"  "Your father will be here presently, he has accom- panied Father Antoine home, we can wait a little for him; how do you feel this bright morning, my dar- ling daughter?"     68     HEIGHTS OF EDELBERG. This glorious morning ought to induce a cheerful spirit, mother, but I overrated and overtaxed my strength last evening, and have passed a sleepless night." "Bertha," said Mrs. Vancleve, as she came in with little Cassy in her arms, "put a warm cloak over Cassy, and walk with her on the verandah front. ing the aviary, she may take her breakfast with you this morning." The child and servant appeared equally well pleased with the arrangement, and after taking a glass of warm milk from her mother, cheer- fully resigned herself to her nurse. "My children, (observed Lady Vancleve as soon as the door closed upon them) I suppose none of us have had very comfortable rest through the night, your father sought none, but none of us have any- thing to dread, and need anticipate no trouble, if Ernest concede to the propositions which his father will lay before him this morning. We both have reason to remember, and most sorrowfully to lament the contact with, and baneful influence of intelligent Protestants; even now my son, there is fear, from some phrases made use of by you last evening, that you are already imbued with heretical sentiments. Ernest, do you possess the proscribed volume?" Ernest glanced at his sister, then dropping his eyes, said distinctly, "Mother, I do." The deadly paleness that overspread her. cheek, might have been held in contrast with the deep crim- son flush upon that of Adele-hopelessness filled the ,   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      69 one heart, astonishment and suspense almost held the breath of the other. At this moment Baron Vancleve enteredi He kiss- ed Adele, bade Ernest good morning, and then stood with his elbow on the mantel quietly awaiting break- fast, his brow alternately knitting and relaxing with the pressure of thought, as he steadily looked towards the fire. The silence was unbroken, until the with- drawal of the servants (no one waitedat the breakfast table unless Cassy were there.) Ernest merely tasted his coffee, then passing his arm over the vacant chair of Cassy, as he pushed his own a little from the table, he said very mildly, "Father, I am grieved my interview with Professor Ostend should have occasioned any uneasiness, rela- (tive to my adherence to the Church of Rome. Yes- terday I had resolved to express no opinion in regard to him, or Professor Basil Weisse, but- the hour has- come (I trust not past) for me to regain, if possible, the confidence and esteem of my father, which he has (am I mistaken, sir?) wrested from me in last night's protracted conference." Hie paused. "Exculpate yourself, if you can, Ernest," replied his father, dropping his head upon his hand, and resting his elbow upon the table. "Are you a faith- ful follower of the Holy Church of Rome, my son?" "That is a question I cannot answer affirmatively, and will not negatively, until I am permitted a thorough investigation of, and am convinced of the va- lidity of her supremacy. I am unprepared to reply."' 7     70     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. The Baron was evidently startled at his temerity. Suddenly rising, he took a few hasty turns up and down the room, and throwing himself into a corner of the sofa, was about to speak, when Adele, who had throughout anxiously watched every movement of both, left her seat at the table also, and sitting down close beside her father, laying her head against his shoulder, she murmured, "Dear papa." "What is it daughter?" he asked, softly kissing her flushed cheek." "Do not look so sternly at Ernest-it will break my heart." The quivering lip of Ernest told where these words fell. "Do not interrupt your father, darling," said Mrs. Vancleve, "it is necessary Ernest should be under- derstood. It was remarked by some one here, lately, the wounds of a friend are sweet." "True, mother," replied Ernest, rolling a chair for himself into the circle, "if the weapon has not been poisoned by an enemy." "My dear boy," exclaimed the Baron, who "has poisoned your mind against the most faithful servants of the Church?" "If my father will allow me to substitute the word disabused for poisoned, I could more readily answer. The terrible inconsistencies of the priests of the Papacy first led me to doubt their infallibility, the diligent examination of the Scriptures has convinced   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      71 me of the entire fallacy of the beloved Church of my family." There was felt silence., Ernest continued, "In making this avowal, I am fully aware of the hazard I incur. I may be debarred the society of my Protestant associates; I may be deprived of my Bible; I may be transferred to the Switzerland University; I may be separated from my dearly loved parents and sisters; but, father, no human power can fetter an enlightened conscience." He paused for a reply. His father was silent. "Why do our clergy prohibit Scripture reading?" asked Adele, timidly, without raising her head from her father's shoulder. "That question is a suggestion of the evil one, daughter. It has started sometimes in my own mind, and only by rigorous penances could this deadly sin be expiated. Adele-my children are dearer to me than my life, but my Church I love as my soul. How can the apostasy of my only son be borne. O! Holy Mother, take thine own means through thy blessed servants, to restore him to thyself'-Baron Vancleve wept. When more composed, Ernest continued:-"It appears to me my father is unnecessarily alarmed; in the eye of the Protestant University, I believe I am considered a staunch Romanist, nor am I prepared to enlist under any other banner; my only desire is to throw off the errors that have crept into our beloved     72     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. Church-the principal one being the galling yoke held by a despotic clergy." "To whom are you indebted, Ernest, for your guid- ance in these matters?" inquired his mother, "to any of the youth of the Protestant College?" "No, dear mother, unless by example. Some of them are held up to us as patterns by our own pre- ceptors. I have received counsel from none; my hand was closed over the book by my sister Cora, in her last sickness. In the first page she had written, 'Search these Scriptures, for in them you will find eternal life. At a fitting moment let father and knother know you possess this book, but make it your friend."' "You always were aware, then, that your sister strayed from the fold of our Blessed Madonna?' said his father, much agitated. Ernest bowed his head. "To whom has this fact been communicated, my son?" "To to earthly being, sir. Circumstances have made me rather premature in mentioning it now. The book is yours, father, if you require it should be given up. But I solemnly assure you, that book has been a source of blessedness to you, the code of morals contained in it has much improved your son; has made me a far more affectionate brother, a far more obedient son, and even a more diligent student, for having before me the holy precepts of the Divine Son of our blessed Virgin. And now, my father, I   HEIGHTS OF EDELBERG.       78 submit myself into your hands, to whatever may be your will, I am resigned, assured that you are guided by deep solicitude for my welfare. But, father, I do protest against any interference of the clergy. My mind or conscience can never be controlled by the Church, her thraldom is more than I will bear. I acknowledge no leader but Jesus. I shall resist every other spiritual yoke."  "sErnest, Ernest," said the Baron, very mildly, though trembling with agitation, "how terribly you mistake the motives of our revered Fathers; they entirely overlook their own, or the temporal good of the people in the intense interest for their spiritual. The heart of Father Antoine was wrung with anguish last night at the bare prospect of your apostasy; he is willing to sacrifice much for your salvation, my dear boy." "His sacrifice would avail me nothing," replied Ernest, with an uncontrollable curl of his lip, but the momentar sneer gave place to a radiant smi' as he gently s   ather, I require no sacrifice, e that made o     more than eighteen hundred years 7ago.      ,at cross I cling, I desire no other mediato       ement."

"Daughter, your brother is in error, but, with the firm belief that his intellect will yet lead him aright, and that truth will prevail, I leave him entirely to himself, with this interdict-that he never converses with you upon the subject, or in any way seeks to infuse his heresy into your bosom." Then turning to Ernest, he continued, still mildly, "My son, I de- mand the volume of my misguided Cora, and remem- ber, it is my heart's desire that all intercourse with the young men of the Protestant College shall be at an end. It is the hour for church, my son." The cheek of Ernest glowed, and his frame trem- bled as he laid his treasured volume in the hand of his father. "Your promise, Ernest." He solemnly bowed his head, and 'hurriedly left the room.

"Daughter, there is no necessity for naming your being witness to the proceedings of this morning at the confessional. You have had no part in it, and I trust it will have no evil influence.

"I will try to do all you desire, my precious fa- ther," she answered, through tears, and, fearing further questions, she pleaded fatigue, and retired to her chamber, to wonder and weep.

The distress of Bertrand can hardly be conceived, when left without a vestige of hope that Carl might still be among the living, he had started as early as he could get a boat to convey him to Eidelberg, and had begun to entertain high hope of finding him, from the encouragement of the boatmen and others. "How shall I return with these tidings to my lone master," he sobbed, "how shall I find words to tell him Carl will return no more." Bertrand had scarcely arrived, when Paul Schiller and Lewellyn Bryant were announced to Baron Van- cleve. It was soon determined thatthey, with the latter and Ernest, would retua:tio-Biseldorf, with Bertrand; their sympathy was i ooi'g to him.

Yes indeed," returned President Stuyvezant, "the loss will fall heavily on us all, but our's sinks into insignificance, when we remember the solitary a homestead, the vacant place at the fireside and table. Carl was, in truth, the light of that dwelling." "And of your Academy, I have understood," pur- sued the Baron. "In both there are several lads of brilliant pro- mise-Ernest Vancleve, Lewellyn Bryant, Leopold Extine, and some few others, stand inferior to none on the Continent. In our department, Paul Schiller, Baden, Ravenscroft and some others are ranked with them." "Excuse me, Dr. Stuyvezant," said the Baron, with a bright look," I did not perceive, until this moment, the sun is gleaming in your face, this side of the boat you will find more pleasant." The seat was changed. "Young Ravenscroft has a sister of extreme love- liness, I believe," inquired Mr. Extine, "has he not?" "A coqin of iLname," replied the Baron," "residing iSthe  se, a mere child though. I rather thin o6u hate allusion to Miss Vandoren, a cousin ata She is intimate with my daughter Adele.

Ernest drew their attention to a luxuriant garden on one side of the house which he said was Carl's pride. He became quite animated, as he pointed out the various plants and the hedge of Dahas he had assisted him in arranging. "Those forest plants, with names unknown to him," said Ernest, "he calledfor his friends; that, he named for me," pointing to a tall bush leaning over the fence, "because I always was attending to something else when he required me-there is Paul Schiller, and there Philip Baden, both in character; that oak in the centre he called his Dominie, for you,: President Stuyvezant, and with his own hand planted and turned as many vines around it as would take root. See, there is ivy, sweet-brier, multifloras, and creepers, twining round the very branches. That sweet elysium in the corner," he said, "was better named sweet Elsie, for it was for ever straying off in every direction, so that he had to attach it by strings from all the little twigs to this tall brown sticlk, which he named for himself. But the storm has beaten some of the plants down; some of us ought to put it in order, Schiller." "Perhaps," replied Mr. Extine, "their gardener will prefer doing it himself." The appearance of Bertrandat the door to admit them, closed the conversation. tI led them into a large bow parlour, comfortably, biUplainly furnished;     80     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. the side window, reaching to the floor, overlooked Carl's garden. The interest Ernest had felt, as he  recollected and rehearsed the pleasure they had felt in tilling it, had for the time beguiled his sorrow; there was a sad reaction as he looked upon the familiar ob- jects in the room; the furniture stood so still-the piano was closed-the guitar was in its case, the books piled away on the shelves. All seemed to say-the voice of the singer is no more to be heard. The measured tick of the clock was the only sound. "How painfully that strikes upon the ear of sad- ness," remarked President Stuyvezant, "it so clearly says to the listener, Time is still with you, with him it is no longer." Ernest needed nothing more than such a remark; his pent-up feelings now gave way, his whole frame shivered with emotion; he was relieved by a few moment's convulsive weeping, and rising, leaned against the casement, looking into the garden, or rather, on vacancy. Very judiciously, no one noticed his agitation. Mrs. Vandoren eptered-he did not observe her until he was attracted by the voice of his father offer- inghis sympathy, as, with the others, she was slightly acquainted. With Ernest, she associated Carl, and for some time was unable to speak for tears. When more calm, she asked the gentlemen to excuse her mentioning their call this morning to Mr. Ravens- croft, as the return of Bertrand, without his son, had completely overwhelmed him. Mrs. Ravenscroft also /   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      81 requested to be excused, in consequence of the ex- treme illness of her little daughter. "Is Elsie ill?" inquired Ernest, with great in- terest. "Critically so, and -requires constant watching; her mind wanders terribly, and at times she is vio- lent. My brother will be much soothed by the kindness of his friends after the first paroxysm of grief is over, in the course of a few days; this blow is so unexpected, it has bereaved him indeed. Baron Vancleve, how is the health of Adele? Cassy was much concerned toj-Jearn that she was more feeble this fall. I wish she would make Cassy a visit, I am sure she would be benefitted by it, and she would be a comfort to my daughter in her lonely sadness. I have left her in charge of the place at Hansbelt during my absence." "If she improve as we hope, Mrs. Vandoren," re- plied the Baron, ", she will be delighted to accept your kind invitation, but Adele, at present, is too frail to attempt the journey. In a day or two, Mrs. Vancleve will call with me, and I sincerely hope you will allow us to render you our services in any way they may be required." Taking his extended hand, with some hesitation, "Shall I take advantage of this kindness, and ask Ernest if he will direct Galen in restoring the garden to order? the storm has beaten down some of the plants, and it would so add to his father's grief, to see ,i                 ,      82     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. it going to destruction. Bertrand is so fully occupied that he cannot give it proper attention." "To be permitted to execute will be a greater gratification," answered Ernest; "we three can dis- pense with Galen as an operative, and while I have a beating pulse, that garden shall be kept in its ori- ginal order." "No words can thank you," replied Mrs. Vando- ren, with filling eyes. "Father," said Ernest, after they had proceeded a short distance, "suppose you leave me with Paul and Leopold to arrange the garden? We can get Herr Stark's boat at any time, and will be home before dinner." The President thought it a good suggestion, and Baron Vancleve assented. As they left the house, President Vonberg's car- riage drove up the avenue.  The cold, dignified salute of President Stuyvezant showed that he recog- nized only his official position, the cordial greeting of the Baron and Professor Extine, told their apprecia- tion of the man. "Here is Dr. Vonberg's card, Meggy," said Mrs. Vandoren. "Will you see him?" "He asked particularly for you, Mrs. Ravenscroft, said Katrine, and directed me to present his respects to you, as well as Mr. Ravenscroft." "Indeed! then I will see him; perhaps a little change of scene may be of service to me." After ar- ranging her dress carefully she descended to the par-   HEIGHTS OF EIDIELBiERG.     83 lour. President Vonberg rose to meet her, and in the kindest manner inquired for her health. "My frame, always delicate," was the reply, "under existing circumstances, cannot be otherwise than shat- tered." "I feared the shock would be almost too great for your sensitive nervous system; for that reason I took the liberty of inquiring for you also, and feel much gratified that you should treat me as a friend, rather than a stranger, by allowing me a personal interview. The name of Mrs. Ravenscroft is so well known to me, that I felt personally acquainted with you, and sincerely hope you will not consider this visit an in- trusion." "Do not consider yourself an intruder, Dr. Von- berg; sympathy is always grateful." "I know it, and from the knowledge I had of your disposition, I feared the worst. Indeed my sympathy went out for you even more than for Mr. Ravenscroft/ particularly, when told at the door, your little daugh- ter was ill also." "Very ill indeed-all night I have been watching beside her." "Indeed! I fear I am detaining you from her. There is no hand like that of a mother, to administer to the wants of a child." "She can spare me just now," she answered, sigh- ing deeply, " her mind wanders, she knows no one." "Alas! alas! your troubles are indeed great; but there is great hope she will recover, a young constitu.     84     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. tion can endure much. Did I not see her with you at the cathedral a few days since?" "No! I was alone," she replied, colouring, "on St. Matthew's day." "How were you pleased with Dr. Weisse?" "Much." "There is so much depth in his preaching, it is just fitted to a mind constituted as yours; food for thought would be given you. You are probably sur- prised," said he, smiling, " that I have such an insight into your character. Report of you has spread much farther than you suspect, and Dr. Weisse told me in confidence, that he preached with far greater zest when he saw so intelligent a lady among his listeners. I know you are above all flattery, or I should scarcely venture to tell you." "You need not fear repeating it. I dislike flattery exceedingly, it is not in my nature to listen to it, but any little pleasant appreciation is only grateful." "He was also much gratified that you should come sometimes to listen to the same truths your fathers so much loved, truths connected so closely with your eternal salvation." "I confess my mind has never been at ease since I first forsook the religion of my ancestors. I should like to know the truth, whatever it may be." 'You are right, there is but one fold and one Shepherd; and the sheep hear his voice only through the teachings of the Church." "So I should wish to believe, but my brother over-   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      85 turns all such doctrines, by numberless texts of Scrip- ture, which I find it impossible to contravert. If I speak of any other intercessor, he turns to the Bible, and brings many such texts as these, "No man cometh unto the Father, but by me.' 'If I speak of the sinless mother of Jesus, and her not needing an atonement, he meets me with the words of Mary, 'My spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour.'" "It only shows the Bible to be of no private inter- pretation; a true knowledge of it must be obtained through the Fathers." "Do you mean the Apostles?" "Indirectly-the Fathers interpret their words." "Were the Fathers inspired?" "Not exactly, but very wise men; but we can trace the Church through our bishops, in a direct line from the Apostles." "Indeed! and did the Apostles confer so much authority upon the Pope?" "No," replied he, again colouring, "he rose from the line of bishops, and received many supernatural tokens of Divine favour. You may easily compre- hend why we keep the Scriptures from our people; it is so easily misapprehended." Mrs. Ravenscroft bowed an assent, fearing to offend her new and distinguished friend, but could not help feeling the subject was rather mystified by the ex- planations. With many kind offers, and farther expressions of sympathy, President Vonberg took his leave, and 8*     86     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. Mrs. Ravenscroft, delighted beyond measure with the flattery poured into her ear, and his warm ex- pressions of friendship, retired to her own room to ponder upon it, before entering the dull chamber of little Elsie. The afternoon brought some fine grapes to Elsie from the garden of Mr. Vonberg, with par. ticular inquiries relative to her health, and every morning the card of the President was handed to Mrs. Ravenscroft, who always made a personal ac- knowledgment of his daily kindness. To return to the garden. Ernest being familiar with the place, led the way to his tool-house,-where were twine, hoes, rakes, spades, knives, &c., &c., ready for service; bags of seed hung against the walls, with the time for planting written upon them, a hat and thick coat hung there also. Had these been remarked upon, Ernest could not have suppressed his bitter feelings, as it was, he felt choked and oppressed among these well-known, never-to-be-forgotten pos- sessions of his dearest companion. In about an hour the garden was once more re- stored to order and beauty. Not a syllable had passed among them, save the half-aside observation of Paul Schiller, "There goes Vonberg's carriage off; he has made quite a visitation." As they surmised, the boat of old Herr Starks was in the cove, and ih a few minutes they landed at Eidelberg, and separated for their respective homes. Day after day dawned upon Ernest in the garden of Carl, at his pleasant, though melancholy, task;   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      87 sometimes Paul Schiller was with him, and occasion- ally one or two of the other students, but Ernest never failed. The tall brown stick he planted firmly into the ground, twisting and turning the Elysian round it; they seemed to be his peculiar care. He had no intercourse with the family, except to inquire for the invalids, and hear each day there was little change for the better. Mrs. Vandoren several times bade him good morning from the parlour window, and asked for Adele, but he never accepted her cour- teous invitation to breakfast, and days passed away monotonously. His father never alluded to his late interdict, or made any remark regarding his present intercourse with the Protestant students. His Bible, he sadly missed, though he had stored much of its contents away in the recesses of his memory and heart. The Thursday week after he last parted with Carl, Epnest was called by Philip Baden into the lecture- room of the Protestant College. President Stuyvez- ant was standing on the platform, surrounded by all the Professors of that academy, and some of the other also. Carl's friends among the students of the latter, were also in the room. Ernest's heart beat quickly, as he surveyed the different groups, conversing in subdued voices, and all looking so sadly. There was perfect stillness, as President Stuyvez- ant laid his hand upon a small spring-bell. "Until this morning, my fellow Professors and young friends, we have had sometimes a hope,     88     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. though, perhaps, a very faint one, that the son of our much respected clergyman, our beloved Carl, might have been driven by the stream on some distant part of the shores of the Niese. His little skiff, his Sea Bird, was found last evening, upside down, on the side of Eagle Island. This leaves the fate of its owner no longer questionable. He that directs the storm, He that holds the wind in his fists, hath guided him to his own haven-even heaven. May he enable us all to say, 'His will be done.' May his bereaved, only parent, receive the consolation he has so often poured into the sorely chastened hearts among his people. At the suggestion of the officers of these schools, it is resolved"-opening a paper he had been holding, he read, "Resolved, That a committee of four-President Vonberg, President Stuyvezant, Ernest Vancleve, and Philip Baden-wait upon the family, and offer the sincere sympathy and services of the Colleges. "Resolved, That all those who desire so to do, will wear crape on the left arm six weeks. "Resolved, To discontinue the duties of both schools one week." There was a rush at the further end of the room. Ernest Vancleve had fainted. Water was hastily procured, and he soon recovered.  Dr. Bryant's small carriage was at the College door, and Gustavus Weber, who was visiting patients with him, volun. teered to drive Ernest home.   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      89 He said a few words to President Stuyvezant as he went out. "I will attend to it, Ernest," he said, very kindly, pressing his hand, "rest at home a day or two." "He has been buoyed up by uncertainty, poor fellow," remarked the President, as he left the room, "the void of expectation was more than he could bear. It was a very deeply rooted attachment. He requested me to ask that another should be chosen in his place to carry the resolutions to the house of Mr. Ravenscroft, as, he does not feel equal to the effort." Lewellyn Bryant was then appointed in his place. As the carriage of Dr. Bryant drew near the house of Ernest, there was evidently some confusion felt by both parties. "I think I can walk up the lawn alone, Gustavus," said Ernest, "many, many thanks for your bringing me thus far." "I shall see you to the door, and in the door, Ernest," replied Gustavus, in a tone not to be op- posed, "you still require the aid of a strong arm, like mine." Ernest made no reply, but taking the proffered arm, they slowly proceeded towards the house. The door was opened by Bertha, who quickly gave the alarm to Mr. Vancleve, who was reading in the study, that Mr. Ernest was sick. Fearing the worst, his father, pale' and troubled, entered the parlour.     90     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "It is nothing, father," said Ernest, in answer to his anxious looks, "I was overcome with a little excitement at College, and fainted; but am now much better. Gustavus Weber," continued he, col-  ouring deeply, notwithstanding- his effort to appear indifferent, "had the kindness to drive me home in Dr. Bryant's carriage, with whom he was visiting patients." Baron Vancleve started. Absorbed in his son, he had not observed the stranger; but quickly turning, with the courtesy natural to him, with a low bow, invited him to be seated. His politeness was civilly, though coolly, declined; the bow of Gustavus, though courteous, was chilling. "Can I be of any further service to you, Ernest?" he asked, at the same time reaching his hat from the table, "if so, it will give me the greatest pleasure. You will be at home for several days, shall I take any message to your classmates? Perhaps, leaving so suddenly, some books will be needed by you that are at school." "Thank you, Gustavus, for those on my table, I shall have necessity. Lewellyn Bryant will bring them to me." "You have laid us under obligation, Mr. Weber, for this kindness to my son; allow me to return you my warmest thanks." "Where there is only pleasure felt, Baron Van- cleve," replied Gustavus, "in the bestowal of a favour, no thanks are necessary." \   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     91 At this moment, the dinner-bell rang. "Do not let me detain you a moment," he said, extending his hand to Ernest, and again bowing deeply to Mr. Vancleve. The Baron hesitated-could he let the stranger go without an invitation-was there ever such a breach of hospitality practised in the house of Vancleve? Ernest's colour came and went, as his eye turned from his father to Gustavus in quick succession. "Mr. Weber," said the Baron, summing up resolu- tion, as the hand of Gustavus was placed upon the door knob, "it is our dinner hour, and, independent of peculiar circumstances, how gladly would I invite you to remain; but you will appreciate my difficulty." "I assure you, Baron Vancleve," replied Gustavus, bitterly, "I know of no difficulties in your way that are tenable, neither am I able to appreciate any mo- tives by which you may be actuated; but I agree with you in thinking the circumstances quite pecu- liar in which I am placed by you in regard to a mem- ber of your family. I visited freely in this house, made no secret of my attachment to your daughter, was permitted to gain her affections, and feel that my happiness was entirely dependent upon her. Then, and not until then, all intercourse *as forbid- den, and two hearts made miserable without any cause. Have you aught against me, Baron Van- cleve?" The whole frame of Baron Vancleve shook with     92     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. agitation, as he answered, "The difference of our religion, Mr. Weber, was an insuperable obstacle. Listen to the teachings of our Church, become a pro- selyte to it, and the hand of Adele is yours, and I shall feel honoured in such an addition to my family." The face of Gustavus was suffused with indignation. "You know not what you ask, Baron Vancleve. Gladly will I make this promise. Let us both take the Bible, the only rule of faith, let us examine its precepts, then, in whatever I differ from them, I shall be willing to yield." "Will you receive its teachings as I receive them, through the Church?" "No!" replied Gustavus, now thoroughly excited. "As soon would I receive my drink through a poison- ous fountain, or my health through a deadly miasma. No! no! I receive my teachings through a glorified Redeemer, by the influence of his Holy Spirit. I go to no human help-and such as Dr. Ostend, or-" "Gustavus," whispered Ernest, "you are excited; you will regret your warmth." "Pardon me, Baron Vancleve, I am detaining you from dinner. Good morning sir"-and before Ernest had time to stop him, he sprang into his carriage, and was out of sight,   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      93 CHAPTER IV. Often the painful present is comforted by flattering the future, And kind to-morrow beareth half the burdens of to-day. Two weeks have passed since the little skiff was launched upon the heaving billows of the Niese, and still no tidings of the lost one. The boat, appearing without a helmsman, told a fearful tale, and the blanched cheek, sunken eye, and quivering lip of Mr. Ravenscroft, spoke the'intensity of agony he had endured during that time. Few words escaped him, but his measured step throughout the night, heard by the inmates of his household, showed that sleep was not even sought by him until, towards morning, he would throw himself upon the bed in a state of perfect exhaustion, and sink into a slumber for a few hours, waking only to renewed sorrow, and realization of his sore bereavement. Although constant and anxious inquiries were made by his parishioners for their much loved pas- tor, Mr. Weberstadt was the only one admitted into his study. A deacon in his church from the time he first became their pastor, their souls were knit to- gether in love. Carl was but one year old when Mr. Ravenscroft came among his people, and, through his childhood, had been a great favourite inl the 9     "     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. family of Mr. Weberstadt, often spending days to- gether at his house. In after years the link was drawn still more closely by the death of his only son, who was of the same age; and the kind attention and sympathy of the gentle boy enabled him to rise almost above his loss, and place his affections upon Carl- not in the same natural flow, which none but a parent can feel, but with a feeling that seemed to say, I am not utterly bereaved. There was therefore a cord of sympathy between them, as the loss was great to Mr. Weberstadt also; and the silent tear which coursed down his cheek showed a deeper affec- tion, and was more soothing to Mr. Ravenscroft, than many words of sympathy. The leisure moments of the good deacon were all spent in the study of his friend, but seldom a word passed between them until the day of which we speak, when the silence was broken by Mr. Weberstadt- "' 'In my Father's house are many mansions'-in one of them our dear Carl was needed; the Saviour went before to prepare a place for him." Mr. Ravenscroft started, and turning his eye full upon his friend, clasped his hands, and raising his eyes upward, essayed to speak, but failed in the attempt; then folding his arms, and placing his head quietly back in his chair, he sat immovable as a statue. Mr. Weberstadt slowly arose, and pressing the hand of his friend kindly, without again speaking, left the apartment; and Mr. Ravenscroft, in the course of an hour, repaired to the room of Elsie.   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      95 "It is just a fortnight since the loss of our dear Carl," said Mrs. Vandoren to Dr. Baden, "yet I can- not give him up." The doctor shook his head mournfully. "There has been so much prayer for him," con- tinued she, "from almost the moment of his departure from Eidelberg, that I feel they must yet be answered. I cannot resign him yet, or see the meaning of it." "The entire submission of his stricken father," said Dr. Baden, "and his child-like trust in God, will do more for the conversion of others than many sermons. Yet, how evident it is his heart is broken; he will not survive long the death of Carl; but a murmur never escapes him. When I said to him the other day, 'This is a mysterious providence; I cannot see that you required it'--he answered in the meekest manner, 'I need all the Lord lays upon me; I only wonder at his many mercies, when' I require so much discipline--the Lord gave, the Lord hath taken, blessed bflphis name.' He then added: How considerate my people have been of me-I cannot be too thankful to them for dispensing with my services the last two weeks. It does my soul good, also, to listen to the truth so faithfully proclaimed by the dominie they have engaged to preach for me. When my head\is under the sod-a time not far distant-I would be glad to have my flock choose such a succes- sor.' But I must now leave you, Mrs. Vandoren, as I have some very sick patients to visit. Elsie only     96     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. requires the cherry; this, with strengthening food, are the medicines she needs." Giving his hand to Mrs. Vandoren, they separated, and she returned to the chamber of Elsie, where she found her brother, sitting beside the large chair in which she was propped, leaning over her in earnest conversation; her head was resting against his shoul- der, and her attenuated hand wreathed in his hair. Her aunt stood unperceived near them. "And you feared you would never enter heaven, daughter? "Yes! uncle, my sins seemed, and still seem very great," replied she, her eyes swimming with tears, "I felt how wicked I had often been to mamma, and how petulant, sometimes," and, lowering her voice, and placing her mouth close to her uncle's ear, "even to dear Carl." The head of her uncle sank low, and he remained silent for some moments, then again looking towards her, he continued, "But did you forget, Elsie, to how great, how good, how kind a Saviour you could go." "No, uncle, I went right to him, Carl told me he would always hear me, that is, he used to tell me, and I thought when I was sick, I heard him tell me so again." "And what did you say to him?" "I said what first came into my mind." "What was it?" "It was much like this. Jesus, here is a little girl wants to love you, and don't know how, please to teach 4   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     97 me, and, if I die, take me to the same home with my cousin Carl, for I know that must be near you." "And did you then feel better?" "No, uncle, I cannot say I did; but I told aunt Meggy all about it, and she talked to me so sweetly of my precious Saviour, and repeated to me so many texts, that I felt I could just go to him with all my sins, and all my troubles, and have felt much better since, though I can never be happy without-never mind, dear uncle," she added, laying her hand affec- tionately on his cheek, "I will not again mention him. I am sorry I have made you so sorry, dear, dear uncle." "Talk to me about what you please, Elsie, but let that Saviour, and that home, be your constant theme; and strive to please him by pleasing others, and try- ing to make them happy. Do nothing in your own strength, but pray for the Spirit's guidance." "Didn't you pray with me every day, uncle, while I was sick?" "Not with you, darling, but for you. It was my daily and hourly prayer that the Lord would raise you up, and make you a lamb of his fold." "How long was I very ill?" "For eight days we despaired of your life; the fever could not be broken; but the many prayers offered for you were heard, and our little Elsie, I trust, will be a greater comfort to us than ever. To Dr. Baden and aunt Meggy you owe much; their attention and kindness were unbounded. The wife 9*     98     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. of our good deacon, also, Mrs. Weberstadt, gave her- self no rest until she saw you ou t of danger." "I always loved her dearly." "Did you, Elsie? She felt a little hurt that you seemed so indifferent to her before your sickness." "Mamma would not allow me to go there; she said she was weaning me from her; but I am going now to try to love mamma more than I ever did before." "The Spirit will teach you, Elsie, to do all that is right, if you pray to be guided by Him." Elsie raised her eyes, and seeing her mother enter, discontinued the conversation. "What a fine little boy Galen is," remarked Mrs. Vandoren, drawing her chair near one Mrs. Ravens- croft had taken--" do you not think so, Annette?" "Indeed, I have scarcely noticed him, Meggy." "' He always was," remarked Elsie. 'I have often gone in to see his poor old mother with cousin Carl; she would invite him to read the Bible to her, and thank him over and over again for his trouble. But how did Galen get here?" "Bertrand did him some favour," replied Mrs. Vandoren, "and the grateful little fellow feels that he can never do enough to repay him. Indeed, he is of service in running errands, and doing many other things. It will also be a great assistance to his mother, as she will be plentifully supplied by Katrine, this winter, from her kitchen store. I paid her a visit yesterday, at the earnest solicitation of her little boy; she was much gratified, and begged me to read   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      99 her a chapter in her Bible, which she keeps always beside her. She seems yearning for the bread of life." "O! let me go," said Elsie, (and read to her every day, when I get well, I should delight in doing it. Shall I, mamma?" Mrs. Ravenscroft hesitated. "Say, mamma, you surely have no objection." "No objection, exactly, Elsie, but it would require some one better versed in Scripture to become a teacher. The Bible is of no private interpretation." "Certainly not," remarked Mr. Ravenscroft, "they\ are a dead letter to all not taught by the Spirit of God, but through the aid of that Spirit, a wayfaring man, though a fool, cannot err therein." "Man. is in great danger, without the assistance of the clergy, of misapprehending Scripture." "Your sentiment, sister, rather savours of Roman- ism; the simplest mind may certainly understand the plan of salvation. Jesus died for sinners; those who feel their need of him, may go direct to him, with all their sins, and cast them at the foot of his cross, and say, 'Here, Lord, I give myself away, 'tis all that I can do."' A slight tap at the door interrupted the conversa- tion. It was Galen, with a message for Mrs. Van- doren. "A gentleman wants to see you, ma'am." The summons was obeyed, and aunt Meggy pro- ceeded to the parlour.     100     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. A stranger, a fine-looking young man, about thirty, arose at her entrance. His frank countenance and manner at once attracted her, and she was drawn to him as to an old friend. "Captain Blucher-Mrs. Vandoren," said he, ex- tending his hand to her, "your name is very familiar to me, I am well acquainted with you by reputation, although not personally." "You have the advantage of me, Captain Blucher," replied Mrs. Vandoren, "my memory is sometimes treacherous." "The most retentive one would not have served you in this instance," said he, laughing, "as my name has probably never reached your ear. I am the mas- ter of a small schooner sailing between this port and Coburg Haven, trading occasionally along the coast. This has been the best voyage I have ever made, freight with the richest cargo, and certainly the only one in which you have any interest." "Interest to me?" "Yes, fraught with the deepest interest. In that voyage, I had the unspeakable happiness of rescuing from a watery grave, one, then a stranger-now, dear to me as a younger brother." The arm of Captain Blucher was clasped convul- sively. "Is Carl safe?" she whispered, her voice refusing louder utterance, "safe-rescued-returning home?" "He is," replied the young man, "safe, and well, and now at the house of Deacon Weberstadt, most   HEIGHTS OP EIDELBERG.     101 impatiently awaiting my return. He advised me to ask for you, as he thought the sudden intelligence might act unfavourably on the nervous system of Mr. Ravenscroft. Carl did not coincide with this opinion, and it was with difficulty I persuaded him to remain behind, his anxiety is so great to see his father and little Elsie, who seems almost equally dear to him." "He must not return so suddenly. I will go with you to caution him." Hastily putting on her shawl and bonnet, they were soon on their way to the house of Mr. Web'er- stadt. The door opened, and the next moment Carl rushed into the arms of his aunt. No word was uttered for some time; tears flowed freely on both sides; at length Carl, seizing his hat, said, "Can I not now see my father?-;I must see him; I can wait no longer." "Have patience, dear Carl," replied Mrs. Vando- ren, "you are not conscious to what a state suspense has reduced him, both physically and mentally; any sudden reaction would, I am confident, prove very injurious to him." Carl threw his hat upon the floor impetuously. "Must it be much longer? Ages seem to have passed since I set foot on the shores of Eiseldorf. Is my father not yet prepared to see me? I cannot think such pleasant reaction would do him injury." "Be governed by older heads, Carl; you will re- gret your precipitancy." "Well, at least, I will go home with you; Ber-     102     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. trand and Katrine are there; I can remain with them until it is broken to my father." "If you will promise, Carl, to restrain yourself until a fitting time." "O, thank you, aunt, thank you-I will promise any thing. Let me but get within those dear walls, within the sound of my father's voice-once more know that little Elsie is near me, and I shall be com- paratively happy." Opening the front door as he spoke, he stood im- patiently awaiting the movements of his aunt. "You will return and dine with us, Captain Blu- cher," said Mrs. Vandoren, glancing at Carl. "Our host seems to forget he has any guest in Eiseldorf." "Pardon me, Captain," said Carl, returning with a face flushed with excitement, " you will, I am sure, make allowances for my forgetfulness." "Do not suppose you are going to deprive me of all my guests at once, Mrs. Vandoren," interfered Mr. Weberstadt, "Captain Blucher dines with me." "My vessel requires my presence, Mr. Weberstadt, or I should be happy to accept your kind invitation; but Master Carl here would throw me so entirely into the back-ground did I return with him, that I shall defer my visit until he has done lionizing. Good-by, Carl; an early visit I shall expect to-morrow on board my little craft." "Many, many visits I hope will pass between us while you are in port," replied Carl, seizing his prof- fered hand. "What do I not owe you, and how   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     103 many grateful hearts you will meet, and how truly welcome you will always be at the parsonage. As you cannot make it your home while here, you will at least dine with us to-morrow." "With pleasure; I long to be introduced to little Miss Elsie, Carl's paragon. There is not a member of your family, Mrs. Vandoren, of whom I have not heard some pleasing anecdote."  "You must make allowance for Carl's affection." "Yes; but he has certainly made me desirous of a personal knowledge of you all, which, I trust, I shall soon have the opportunity of gratifying. Good morn- ing; I see Carl is quite willing I should give him leave of absence." So saying, he took his leave, and Mrs. Vandoren and Carl proceeded homeward. Mrs Vandoren, as soon as Captain Blucher had apprized her of Carl's safety, before setting out for Mr. Weberstadt's, had communicated the joyful intel- ligence to Bertrand and Katrine. The effect on them may be better imagined than described. The first feeling of Bertrand was to go directly to his young master, but, as he seized his hat for that purpose, Mrs. Vandoren stopped him. "Not so, Bertrand, you are needed here; the utmost caution will be requisite in breaking it to Mr. Ravenscroft. You may have an opportunity, be- fore, I return, of preparing his mind in a measure for -a it; at any rate, you must be here to receive Carl, and keep him from rushing into his father's presence.     104     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. You understand his impetuosity, and will know how to meet it." "Let Carl come in at the back door, Mrs. Vando- ren; there will be one, at any rate, there to receive him," said Katrine, laughing and crying alternately. "If my dinner is spoiled, Carl can't complain, for I am sure it will be altogether his fault." "I do not think there will be much beside thanks- giving in the house of Ravenscroft this day," Katrine. I will soon return with Carl, and give him into your charge until further orders." Bertrand went immediately to seek Mr. Ravens- croft. Not finding him in his own chamber, he tap- ped at the door of Elsie, but seeing her mother, he drew back, and was recalled by Mr. Ravenscroft. "Come in, Bertrand; have you business with me? What has made you look so bright this morning?" "The College boys have taken great pains to ascer- tain, sir, what vessels were in the bay on the night of the 8th of September. It was literally studded with them, no less than twenty being on the mer- chants' books as ready to sail on the following morn- ing. It is therefore almost impossible that Master Carl could have been passed unnoticed. I feel satis- fied that hIe is safe, that he is in one of those vessels, and that the first one that comes to port will bring him in it." "Bertrand, Bertrand," said his master, "do not excite hopes, perhaps never to be realized." "No, master, I trust it is a hope that has some   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     105 foundation. The schooner Ariel has probably arrived by this time; it was seen in the bay at the time of the storm, and its master, Captain Blucher, is known for his great humanity, and would have taken every pains to save a fellow-being."  "I will endeavour, Bertrand, not to have my hopes raised too high; another disappointment would be more than my frame, in its present weak state, could bear." "Let us wait, then," replied Bertrand, almost be- side himself with excitement. "I feel confident our dear boy will be with us to-night." "Boy!" repeated Mrs. Ravenscroft, scornfully; but it was unnoticed. "I know your sanguine temperament, Bertrand; refrain, for my sake refrain--you ar' greatly excited. My hopes have so often risen, and been brought low, that I fear to allow myself even to hope." At this moment his sister entered. Mr. Ravens- croft had risen, and was pacing the floor rapidly. Elsie, forgetful of her weakness, sprang from her chair, and seized the hand of Bertrand. The effort was too much, and she was near falling. Bertrand took her in his arms, and, forgetful of her mother's presence, kindly kissed her hand. The eye of Mrs. Ravenscroft flashed with indigna- tion, and immediately removing Elsie from the com- fortable position she seemed to be much enjoying, she added, in a low voice "By' a portion of this 10     106     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. family, familiarity will not be tolerated; from hence- forth I would have you remember the difference of your position." Bertrand turned quickly, and met a glance in which was mingled the utmost scorn and anger. "In my position, Mrs. Ravenscroft," he answered, in the mildest tones, "however lowly it may be, I endeavour to fulfil my duty, and keep a conscience void of offence." Mrs. Ravenscroft stood. transfixed for a moment, then casting a look upon him he could scarcely de- fine, she left the room. By Mr. Ravenscroft and his sister all this passed unobserved. Mrs. VYandoren's whole mind was fixed on the best method of breaking the return of Carl, , without giving another shock to his nervous system. "I have just seen Mr. Weberstadt, brother. After all that has been ascertained about the vessels in the bay, he is in high hope about Carl; he feels certain the schooner of Captain Blucher is laden with the precious freight. If so, he may dine with us to-day." "Meggy! Meggy!" exclaimed Mr. Ravenscroft, "have you certain intelligence of our dear boy? You surely would not excite hope on such slender ground." "If I should tell you, Eldrid, that he is in the bay, drawing near to shore, could you bear the intelli- gence?" "Safe!-well!" repeated Mr. Ravenscroft, slowly. "My own boy-my Carl-my only son-my staff-   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      107 my pride-safe! Can it be such happiness is vouch- safed to me!" Bertrand disappeared. ,' He is safe, and well," continued his sister, "' and you may prepare yourself for a speedy interview with him. I think he will make one at our dinner table to-day." The next instant the door burst open, and Carl threw himself into his father's arms. "Father, dear father, am I indeed again with you!" "My son-my own son!" was all that Mr. Ravens- croft could utter, and would have fallen to the flior had not the strong arm of his son supported him. "The suspense has been too much for you, dear father-you look ill, very ill!" "I shall now be soon restored, with my own Carl near me-but joy overcame me-I will rest upon this divan until I become more composed." After leading him to the couch, and placing him carefully upon it, he turned to Elsie; a warm kiss was imprinted on her wet cheek, and she was soon upon his knee, her head resting upon his shoulder, close beside his father. "But, my darling little cousin," said he cheerfully, "I cannot have you cry so much, now I have returned; and here you are, looking so pale and thin. I shall have to carry you down to the river-side to-morrow; the pleasant breezes will soon restore colour to your cheek, and you will again be my bright little Elsie." In about an hour the dinner bell rang, and Carl,      108     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. giving his father his arm, proceeded to the dining- room, followed by Katrine, carrying Elsie, who de- sired to take the first meal with cousin Carl. Mrs. Ravenscroft came into the room a moment after. Carl warmly greeted her. "Where were you, aunt Annette," asked he, pleasantly, "when all the world was upside-down at the unexpected appearance of so important a personage?" "I intended coming to greet you, Carl, but was prevented by a sad nervous headache which came on suddenly." "I hope it will soon be better, aunt, for I have much to tell you all when father and Elsie are able to listen. Since the 8th of September I feel as though myriads of years had passed, and gratitude to my Maker for my wonderful preservation has, during that time, been my prominent thought. Where is Cassy, aunt Meggy?" "At home, attending to house matters during my absence; but I expect her here this afternoon." "I long to see her; can she not remain a few days with us?" "She can, if you so much desire it. Her concern for you has been so great that her lessons have been almost entirely neglected. Bertrand has gone to tell her the joyful news of your return, and bring her here this afternoon." "Bertrand!-what does he not do! I feel that I have not a better friend in all Eiseldorf." Mrs. Ra- venscroft's brow darkened. "What about Ernest?" V,   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     109 "He has had your garden under his daily care; it has been kept in perfect order, not a weed being per- mitted to remain." "I observed its neatness, and wondered what hand had kept it so. Dear Ernest, he has a loving heart and noble intellect, which will not long be bound down to senseless forms; he will investigate, and find the truth." "What is the truth?" asked Mrs. Ravenscroft, in a tone of scorn that startled him, "The truths of Holy Writ," answered he, gently, "penned by inspiration, of which the prominent one is, that Jesus is the only Mediator between God and man; breaking down at once the flimsy fabrics of Romish superstition?" "It is the oldest church among us," replied his aunt, much excited. "Older than the Apostles?" asked Mr. Ravens- croft. "No, no, Annette; if you examine for your- self, you will find that as the Church became fearfully corrupt, they gained the ascendancy, and spread themselves over a great portion of the world. A pure church still remained, the Albigenses and Waldenses, and notwithstanding all the persecutions they have endured, still continue a Protestant Christian people." "I am satisfied to leave investigation to those who will not be so likely to err as myself." "We are all liable to err, Annette, if relying on our own strength; but by prayer we can do all things through Christ, who strengthens us." -  10*     "O     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERGO "President Vonberg's card," interrupted Katrine. "I told him you were at dinner, and he said he would call this evening. He came to offer his congratula- tions to Mr. Ravenscroft on the return of his son. He inquired for Mrs. Ravenscroft also." "President Vonberg!" exclaimed Carl. "What has induced a visit from him? I certainly cannot be an object of much interest to him; at any rate, there would be little affinity on my part. He is a man from whom my whole nature would recoil." "Do you not speak rather unadvisedly, my son?" "No, father, I have seen him in every situation, and respected him in none. His fascinating manners and commanding appearance covers a heart warped by prejudice, narrowed by avarice, and hardened by constant intercourse with Jesuit priests. Known to the college boys as a spy upon their actions, they sedulously avoid his society; and I believe, were they not afraid of consequences, they would endeavour to throw off the yoke of their President and two of their Professors, Fathers Antoine and Basil, as they call them. Many of those boys, you know, are my per- sonal friends; they are frank, generous, and noble- hearted, with minds capable of examining for them- selves, and with spirits not willing to be kept under restraint. Let them once have access to the Bible, and the school, now tottering, will be shaken to its founda- tion. I have seldom heard them speak upon the subject; but their constrained manner, when these gentlemen join them at recess, or endeavour to draw   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBEBRG     11t them into religious conversation when walking uponf the shore, and their efforts to avoid their society, show their appreciation of their attention to them. So different from our College. Out of school, President Stuyvezant is our companion. It is no uncommon thing to see him engaged at a game of ball, or enter- taining us with some pleasant story, the whole school endeavouring to get as near him as possible; and often, in the evening, you may see him strolling along the shore, the boys leaning familiarly or his arm. At study hours, he is our President;- at other times, our companion and friend. He has no reward to offer but his commendation, which is quite sufficient; and no punishment is felt so keenly as his rebuke. The Bible is examined carefully and prayerfully in the College; and last year, you remember, there were no less than twenty hopefully converted. Among them was Gustavus Weber, now in the Medical College, a most splendid young man, one fitted to fill any station. Do you know him, father?" Is he a son of Frederick Gustavus Weber?' "The same." "I know him well. There is not a man of greater weight among us." "Gustavus, or Gus, as we call him, was telling us a little anecdpte, that will give you an idea of his tact. He was walking slowly along-the river, one evening, when he was joined by one of the Romanist boys, with whom he was well acquainted. Afterrtalk- ing a little while on unimportant subjects, he suddenly X     "2     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. turned, and said: 'There is one question I want to ask you, Gustavus. How do you get along without a confessional?' 'We have one,' was the reply. 'No! then I was misinformed.' 'You certainly were; morning and evening I confess my sins.' 'Is it pos- sible? We are under no constraint to go more than once a week.' 'But go willingly and joyfully.' 'May I ask you how your clergyman makes it so pleasant to. you.' 'Come to my room to-morrow, and I will tell you all about it.' 'Thank you; most willingly. The con- fessional to me is hateful. I should like to learn the way to have it made more tolerable, as those who live in the College are obliged to submit to it or be ex- pelled. Good-night. To-morrow, but it must be after dark, you may expect me.' True to his promise, the next evening he was sitting beside the study lamp of his friend, and again requested an)explanation. "In the first place," said Gustavus, "I would ask you, who is the propitiation for our sins?" "Jesus Christ, of course," was the reply. "Then, could any man have greater love than to lay down his life for his friend?" "Certainly not." Avoiding, still, any Scripture phrases, he pro- ceeded: "Then how are we to know whether we are the friends of Jesus?" Father Antoine would say, by attending to all the observances of the Church; but I confess Ican- not tell."   HEIGHTS OF' EIDELBERG.-    113 "Christ says we are his friends if we do what he commands us." "But we have gone far from the subject, Gustavus. My question is, what is your mode of confession?" "Pardon me, I am only answering that question. You know I go to the fountain head,) Lewellyn--to the Bible." "Yes, but I am interdicted that, Gustavus. The holy fathers would lay their bans upon me if I med- dled with it." "Thanks be to God, I am permitted to read it; for there I am told by the pen of inspiration, in the words of Jusus, 'I am the bread of life; he that cometh to me shall never hunger; he that believeth on me shall never thirst.' It is written in the Pro- phets, They shall be all taught of whom?-of God.' Not through the Church, but through the teachings  of God's Spirit. By the same pen it is written,   : 'Knock, and it shall be opened to you; ask, and ye shall receive.' Then to whom should I confess?-- to whom should you confess, but unto Jesus, the author and, finisher of our faith? Examine this," continued he, at the same time handing him a small pocket Bible, "in it you will find many passages marked to answer your question, and I desire you to note any one in which a saint, or angel, cherubim, or seraphim, are to intercede for us. It is your own Catholic Bible-take it, hide it, if you please, but -make it the man of your counsel, and may God bless you in its study."                 !     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. The young man stood irresolute; then striking the table vehemently, he said, " I will take it, Gustavus, and I will read it too, in spite of all the Fathers in the College-yes, or in the Church of Rome." "And may you learn all its truths, dear Lewellyn. You will then soon find the confessional a place where you will delight to go. May the Spirit bless his own truth." "Thank you, thank you, Gustavus-the bell rings for vespers. Good-night; I shall often steal a visit to you." " Gustavus told me that a day seldom passed that an explanation was not asked of some text of Scripture, showing his interest in the book. Unfortunately, it was near the close of Gustavus' last term., I have heard nothing of him since." Raising his head at this moment his eye met that of his aunt. Her scornful, sarcastic expression, at first surprised hinm, but being accustomed to her strange sallies of temper, it was soon forgotten, and the con- versation turned upon other subjects. "At what time, my son, were you released from your perilous situation on the water ?" " At about eight o'clock, father; but I prefer say. ing nothing upon the subject until you are more com- posed. I will then give a detailed account of the miraculous manner in which I was preserved." The dinner was removed, and Elsie, not feeling fatigued, declined going to her own chamber, as her mother proposed, but remained in the dining-room   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERGt.   :115   with cousin Carl, aunt Meggy, and Mr. Ravenscroft. Mrs. Ravenscroft retired to her own room, pleading headache as an excuse. Towards evening, much to the joy of all parties, Cassy joined the little group. At the first sound of her light, well-known footstep, Carl sprang to the door, and the next moment her arnm encircled his neck. " My own dear Carl !" she sobbed, "how rejoiced I am to see you once more !" "Rejoiced, indeed!" he replied, returning her embrace affectionately, and endeavouring at the same time to rally her, "rejoiced with your eyes full of tears. Here is my little cousin Elsie too, just laugh- ing and crying ever since I came home, yet protesting she is so glad to see cousin Carl." "Well, well!" replied Cassy, laughing through her tears, A I will try to set her a better example. Let us only laugh, Elsie, and leave the tears for a more cloudy day. I will just take my bonnet up stairs, and soon return to enjoy this newly arrived stranger." The bonnet and shawl found a resting place, and the beautiful girl returned *ith a face beaming with joy and mirthfulness.  "I verily thought Bertrand would never get me here, so impatient was I to annihilate the space be- tween us. I could not be convinced we were making any speed until he invited me to count the posts of the fences; a matter I found rather difficult." "It was three o'clock when Bertrand started from here."    "6     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "It is now near six; but I was obliged to make some house arrangements, which detained me, as I do not intend paying a very flying visit here- a week, at least, unless mamma put her veto upon it." "Come, aunt Meggy," said Carl, "set our minds at rest on this subject." "In a week school commences," replied her mo- ther; "have you your books with you to study your lessons for the first day?" "Books! No, indeed, mamma, I shall have enough to do to hear cousin Carl's story, and thoroughly  digest it. But, first of all, I must run and see Ka- trine; Carl must not place her'entirely in the shade." So saying, she disappeared, and was soon seated be- side her old friend in the kitchen, whose kind wel- come showed her appreciation of Miss Cassy. "How different an aspect every thing assumes as soon as Cassy comes among us," remarked Mr. Ravenscroft-" just listen to that joyous laugh of Katrine's." "Cassy is always ready to rejoice with those who rejoice, and mourn with those who mourn." "Cassy Vandoren is a noble girl," observed Carl, "I know not her equal." "Her lovely, affable manners," said Mr. Ravens- croft, "win all who know her, and her kind, loving heart, is open to all suffering." "Her appearance fascinates every one, father; there is something in that beaming expression of   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBE G.     117 countenance that would strike every beholder, if not combined with such regularity of feature. She has  not the slightest German appearance; how is that, aunt? Those black eyes and long lashes do not belong to these parts." "I cannot tell,' Carl, her family are German throughout; she is not even very fair, and if it were not for light curls, I should have to disown her, par- ticularly, as she is so tall and slender, instead of being, according to a homely expression, Dutch built." "Dutch built, indeed!-she is fleet of foot as a roe. I have often tried in vain to catch her, when she was determined to elude my grasp. Listen," said Mr. Ravenscroft, "there is the ringing laugh of little Galen, no doubt she is telling him some amusing story to suit his capacity." The sound of the tea-bell brought Cassy into the parlour, and Mrs. Ravenscroft entered at the same time. "Why was not tea ready before?" she asked, "it is much later than usual, this evening." "I must plead guilty, aunt Annette, as the cause of it. The cook and waiter had such an intellectual feast, that they forgot the physical wants of the innexr man." "You have been poorly employed, Cassy, in pros mroting entertainment for the kitchen." "I am happy, Aunt Annette, to contribute to the ? happiness of any, rich or poor, low or high, an:d I feel it just as much my duty as my pleasure ;to " U      "8     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. please such as little Galen, as any of the present company, not excepting yourself, aunt," she added, playfully, at the same time dropping her a low curt. sey; then, stopping before her, and eyeing her closely, she exclaimed, "Why, auntie, how is this? You will certainly bear the palm, if any beaux arrive this evening." "Yes, mamma," observed Elsie, "I never saw you look so pretty." "That is rather an ambiguous compliment, Elsie, that my good looks are a matter of surprise to you." ' I meant, mamma, that those crimson ribbons min- gled beautifully with your dark hair, and those coral earrings suited your complexion, and that hand- some-" "Any more remarks on the same subject, Elsie, will be excused." Elsie coloured deeply, but said nothing, and the conversation turned upon other subjects. The table was scarcely removed, when President Vonberg was announced. Cassy had seated herself at the piano, and Ernest was busily engaged searching for a favourite piece of music. Elsie had been placed upon the couch by Carl, and was reclining comfortably on several large cushions. Mr. Ravenscroft was sitting at her feet on the divan. "Here it is, Cassy," said Carl-"Sounds from Home. I want once again to sing it with you." "Do you not like it with variations, cousin?" she    HEIGHTS OP EIDELBERG.     119 asked, "you know it is a four-handed piece, and we can play it together." "Yes, but I want to listen to your voice first." The music was placed before her, and the first chord struck, when President Vonberg entered. Mr. Ravenscroft rose, and received with great courtesy his congratulations on the safe return of his son. "You and-I should be better acquainted Carl,' said the President, taking his hand between both of his, "at Eidelberg, we often meet on common ground, along the shores of the Niese." A cold, formal bow, was the only return for the low, courteous one of Dr. Vonberg. "The fine scenery along its borders will no longer charm you," he remarked, without seeming to notice Carl's manner, "the feeling will be so mingled with what you have suffered upon its waters." "There would be so much cause for gratitude to my deliverer," replied Carl, gravely, that looking upon nature, through Him who formed it, would only add to itsosublimity." "True, true, most certainly," he replied, with some confusion; "you have, indeed, much to be grateful for; it was a wonderful deliverance, as you say. But I fear I have interrupted some sweet strains by my entrance." "Let me introduce you, Dr. Vonberg, to my sister and niece, Mrs. and Miss Vandoren-with Mrs. Ra. venscroft I believe you are already acquainted. Elsie  - f      120     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. Ravenscroft is also a stranger to you, her sickness has excluded her from all society for some time." Miss Vandoren rose from the piano, and most cour- teously received the new guest. A grateful. look from Mrs. Ravenscroft surprised her; to a look of displeasure, she was well accustomed, and heeded it not; but what had transpired to obtain her ap- probation, was more than she could imagine. After receiving each member of the family with some bland expression, he turned to Elsie, and seating himself  beside her, he remarked, "As Miss Elsie is still an invalid, I thought a few buncheq of fruit from my  grapery would be acceptable, as they always are to a delicate appetite, although her cheeks look as though they needed something a little more nutritious; these are some of my finest, and the few bunches that re- main,-I will reserve purposely for you." "O! thank you, Dr. Vonberg, thank you-they will indeed be very grateful to me; there is nothing I relish as much as a bunch of grapes." Mrs. Ravenscroft looked delighted; "I am sure Elsie will appreciate your kindness, Dr. Vonberg."  "Do you not think, Mrs. Ravenscroft, a little fresh j air would be beneficial to Elsie? to-morrow morning I shall be at leisure, and my carriage will be at the  service of the ladies." Mrs. Vandoren excused herself. "The young ladies have a prior engagement with me, Dr. Vonberg," answered Carl, "I must therefore beg to make their apology."   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERIG.     121 Of what nature her engagement could be with Carl, Cassy was at a loss to divine, but she awaited the departure of Dr. Vonberg to ask an explanation. "I hope we will have the pleasure of your com- pany, Mrs. Ravenscroft, my sister is particularly de- sirous you should accompany us to my new cocoonery, about ten miles distant up the river." "With pleasure, Doctor; in the labours of the inge- nious little silkworm, I have always taken quite an interest." "What hour would suit you? of course my time will be governed by your leisure. Shall I call at eleven?" Mrs. Ravenscroft bowed a smiling assent, and Pre- sident Vonberg pleading an engagement, took his leave. "How much I like Dr. Vonberg," said Elsie, "he is so kind, and clever, only think, he is going to keep all his best grapes for me. Do you not think it is very kind, mamma?" "I think all he ever does is kind, my dear. What engagement have the young ladies, Carl, of so import; ant a nature, they could not ride to-morrow." "I am going to take the carriage, and give Elsie the fresh air along the borders of the river; Cassy and father are going with us." "Is that the wonderful engagement?" she replied contemptuously, "'I should have thought the other ride for Elsie far more pleasant."  To avoid further unpleasant altercation, Carl struck I *                    kug'- v              aOF^     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBEBG. the key note, and Cassy, taking her seat at the piano, commenced singing with him, "Sounds from home." "There," Miss Cassy, "pray do not begin the next verse, I cannot wait a moment longer," exclaimed Dr. Baden, who had entered unobserved, "Such waking up is worth the fortnight's nightmare we have all suffered." The warm, affectionate greeting, as Carl sprang to receive him, drew tears from every eye, little Elsie actually sobbed. "Why, my pet, said the good Doctor, taking her on his knee, "I should have been very happy to have produced these tears, during your cousin's absence, but come, we must drive them all away now; smiles t of thankfulness daughter, smiles of thankfulness"-  his own eyes overflowing as he spoke. Elsie choked down her tears, and could not help laughing as she met Carl's look of affected reproach. "Let her come to me, doctor," said Carl, her nerv- ous system is a good deal shattered, I must try to build her up again." '"And will bring the roses back to Elsie's cheeks," replied the Doctor, "far sooner than all Baden's tonics. My dear friend," he continued, turning to Mr. Ra- venscroft, "all my sympathies have been stirred for  you; how delightful to rejoice with the rejoicing."  Mr. Ravenscroft held the Dootor's hand, but had no power of utterance. Carl, with his usual adroit-  ness, turned the conversation, and it soon became  general. "I feel quite in a hurry to show myself at the   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      123 Heights," he remarked; "I can hardly wait until to-morrow." "It will take several to agree to another evening sail, be the Niese as smooth as a mirror, youngster," replied the Doctor; there may not always be a Blu. cher at hand to fish you up." "That bridge ought to be rebuilt," said Cassie, "there is such constant intercourse between the Heights and Eiseldorf; we should not be dependent entirely on boats." "A happy thought, you shrewd Miss Cassy. I will head the petition, and to the Burgomaster it shall go; I will certify to every name of note both sides of the stream." "The Burgomaster will smoke it off in three puffs of that vile pipe of his," returned Cassy. "Get up a subscription list; I will vouch for the signatures of all the young ladies-Carl, think the students will withhold theirs?" "The bridge is as good as built, Cassy, if it de- pend upon you," replied her cousin, laughing; "but is there no fear we shall tramp out our new bridge, and our welcome too, if our fair exemplars give us such a facility for repeated visits?" "Well, well!" returned the bright-eyed girl, "let us rear the connecting link, and if we find it an in- cumbrance, we can try the force of names to disunite us once again."  The conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Mr. and Mrs. Weberstadt, and, soon after, evening  is ' - - ,*        * '  -          ^     124     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. worship was proposed. "Rock of Ages" was sung with deep feeling; the voice and full heart of Dr. Baden led in prayer, which completely overcame Elsie again. "I cannot help it," she whispered, in answer to his look of concern-" is it wrong?" "No! Elsie, you have had almost too much for your nervous temperament," he said, gently drawing her head against his shoulder, and patting her cheek; "time, with the sovereign balm of Gilead, will heal that poor stricken heart-and as much air as possible, Carl"-and with a kind fatherly kiss he bid her good-night. The other guests soon after took their  leave, and with hearts overflowing with gratitude, the inmates retired to their respective chambers. "Good-night, cousin Carl," said Elsie, as she passed his door; "I never expected to say that again." "O, come in here a minute, Elsie," he said in a low voice-"how long since Vonberg thought him- self entitled to visit here?" "He has been kindly making inquiries for you since Monday two weeks, and kept me plentifully supplied with fruits from his garden. Mamma said that he came every morning to make inquiries for you, and every afternoon his servant came with fruit for me. He is very charming, is he not?" "Where were you when I mentioned him at din- ner, Elsie?-were you not at the table?"  "No; I left it with Katrine, long before you had   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      125 finished dinner. She had something to show me in the kitchen. I didn't hear you mention him." "It is well, Elsie. But I must say I have not cultivated intercourse with him; perhaps he improves on acquaintance." "He does, indeed. Good-night, coz, mamma will be wondering after me;" and giving him another good-night kiss, she left him. "Deal, innocent child," thought Carl; ' I trust no trouble is in store for her. Her mother's fortune may be a great inducement to a villain." CHAPTER V. "Freedom gloweth in his eyes, and nobleness of nature at his heart; And Independence took a crown and fixed it on his head." "A SPLENDID evening, Vancleve!" Ernest started from his reverie, and returned the salutation of President Stuyvezant. "You seem fond of rambling on the banks of the Niese," he continued. A faint smile played for a moment over the features of Ernest, as he replied, "I have looked on the river Mith romantic fondness from my cradle; but, as the grave of Carl, it has magnetic attraction."  The sympathizing eye of Stuyvezant fell on the quivering lip of the youth. Laying his hand gently *     126     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERO. on his shoulder, he said, "Ernest, I should exceed my province, and overstep prescribed bounds, were I to point you to the source of consolation found only in the Scriptures; but I may ask, why bind your thoughts to the humanity of Carl? Why not follow his glorified spirit to the banks of the river of life- to the bosom of his Saviour?" ( I am unable, sir, to unfasten my mind from the spot of our parting, and my thoughts continually re- vert to his rejection of our blessed Mother, whose protection I proffered-him." "As Provost, I may not discuss that point with a Romanist. We Protestants give scriptural honour, but no power to the Virgin." "I know it, sir; and in this affliction I may be shown this error of your Church. 'What is 'truth?' is an intricate question; and this is a .very dark world, President Stuyvezant." As he spoke, Ernest seated himself on a projecting rock, and Dr. Stuyvezant immediately sat by his side. "Ernest," he said, with deep interest in his manner- Ernest, such a sentiment is more fitted for one of my years; I grieve to hear it from the lips of eighteen. The first sorrow is always keenly felt; once and again has my heart been crushed-but, Ernest, as often has the healing beams of the Spirit of God passed over my soul, cheering and illuminating my darkness, even as that brilliant orb rides through the heavens, reflecting her mild rays on the bosom of these waters."   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      127 "That moon!" interrupted the youth, impetuously, "her very serenity mocks my troubles, and the unruf- fled flow of the Niese adds treble weight to my bur- dened spirit. The calmness of the waves now can scarcely be recognized as those lashed to fury a fort- night since-my own dear, but deceitful stream." President Stuyvezant sighed. "Endeavour to be calm," he said, resting his hand on .the knee of Ernest. "Shall I tell you there is balm in Gilead, and a Physician there? Go to your Fathers, Ernest; ask them for their soothing influence. I know not their resources; but surely there must be something to assuage sorrow. Cannot we both look from our beloved Carl to his God? He never afflicts willingly, and is ready to help all who are heavy laden. You have been favoured, while attending to that garden, 9oh daily intercourse with the bereaved father of an only son. You are thrown into the society of the preceptors of no common pupil. We all have an assured hope of the salvation of the missing one, and all look forward to a reunion beyond the skies. No Church is forbidden this consolation. "Both cannot be right," answered Ernest; "still the quere arises, ' What is truth?'" Yes, a question of momentous interest, my young friend," replied the President. "Our Churches differ widely in the response. Sift them both, Vaneleve; leave not a stone unturned; overturn, from turret to foundation, until you are satisfied which is right. Make thorough investigation; and may you find the:     128     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. way, the truth, and the life," concluded the Presi- dent, rising, and grasping his hand. Ernest returned the pressure, and made an effort to say something, but checked himself. Dr. Stuyvezant noticed it, but made no remark. "'I must leave you, Ernest," he observed; "it is within a few minutes of the hour for prayer. I shall have time only to get to the chapel." Ernest also arose, and taking again the hand of the President, said, with a great effort to appear calm, Pray for me." ' I did not require to be asked," he replied, with  an affectionate smile. "I know it, I know it," returned Ernest, closing his hand in both of his; "not only pray for, pray with me-here at the sepulchre of Carl;-pray that I may find the truth-his truth-to illumine my dark spirit, to comfort my distressed heart. The effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much." The force of this truth was manifest in the calm demeanor, gentle spirit, and subdued manner of Ernest ever after. Circumstances had made him sad; but there was a freedom from general depression which could not but be noticed, and was, particularly by his parents. On his return home that evening, he and his sister received a note from a committee appointed by the Protestant department, inviting them to unite with them in an excursion on the bay, next morning, to start at twelve o'clock. Most of the young ladies of  /     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      129 Eidelberg had been invited, the note stated, and they would be disappointed to receive a regret from Miss Adele Vancleve. Baron and Mrs. Vancleve were much pleased with the project. "Your sister will be much better," said the latter to Ernest, " if her strength will only be sufficient for this trip, it will so completely change the current of thought. Ernest, the Medical School are not invited?" "Yes, mother, but Dr. Weber has declined accom- panying the party; if all the rest accept the invita- tion, you will not object," he replied, with a sad smile. "I go myself to take Adele. I do not feel very much like taking a pleasure sail; yet if it would benefit her, I would gladly go every day in the week. I must omit my morning work at Eiseldorf to-morrow. That is a great, though a mournful pleasure to me, mother. Mr. Ravenscroft has assisted me the last two days. Mother, he is a very remarkable man. True, he is' very sad; but so submissive, so uncomplaining, so perfectly resigned. How can he be thus sustained by his false religion? What else can it be, mother? Hie does not mention Carl, and he never calls me son, as was his custom; but he makes a great exertion to talk with me, instructs me about plants, points out the different wonders-in nature to me. He would amaze you, mother. Iknow from whence he obtains strength; from the book forbidden by our Church; the book I may not call mine, without offence to my father." "Ernest," replied his mother, "be cautious; it 'l,     130     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. was only your gentle acquiescence to your father's will, in giving up that volume, and ready promise to' stay some associations, that induced your father to withdraw further opposition, recommended by his reverence, Father Antoine. Do not, by contemptuous words, Ernest, deserve the anathemas of the Holy Mother Church, you have already greatly offended; nor rouse an earthly parent's wrath, whose only fault is loving you to blind indulgence. The tearful remon- strances, last night, of Father Antoine, showed me most vividly the hazard of the soul of an only son, in the permission of continued intercourse with this dan- gerous family." The cheek of the young man grew pale with indig. nation. "Dear mother-for you are my mother, and much does that only son love and honour you; but hear me, mother. You may be satisfied in your own mind concerning Papacy. Father may be influenced by her Jesuit priests, to try strenuous measures to keep me within her thraldom; but it is my firm deter- mination to openly declare myself a Protestant, so soon as I may be handed over to their jurisdiction. I Go wealth-welcome poverty-aye, aye! disgrace.  Ernest Vancleve shrinks from neither. Good-night,  mother." He left her for the first time in his life i without a kiss.  "Dr. Bryant's cariage is at the door," exclaimed i little Cassy, "with Miss Tony in it, waiting for sis- ter to go to the Landing, to the grand sail this morn- j 1L   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      131 ing," and away she sprang up stairs, to hurry Adele, who was preparing to go. "A larger shawl, Miss Adele," urged Bertha, "it will be chilly on the water, though it seem so warm to day." "It's right hot," said Cassy, dashing back her curls; "brother Ernest says he will meet you at the boat; he has to go for somebody, I forget who. Tony Bryant says, don't hurry, there is plenty of time. I wish I was big, then I could go-could I sister?" "You darling child," replied her sister, "we are only afraid some evil might befall you, or you should not be left behind, little or big." She kissed her good-bye two or three times, and her father who came to meet her, placed her in the carriage by the side of Miss Bryant. In a few mo- ments, the horses were drawn up with several others, at the College landing. Most of the students from both schools were there. Many from the Medical. Some of the Professors also, as spectators. "We could not have selected a more splendid day," said Ernest, as he passed, hat in hand, with the beautiful Meta Vance upon his arm. His sister, he had ascertained, was well manned by Lewellyn Bryant, and Paul Schiller. Ernest had expected, and intended having the charge of his sister, and was not a little chagrined to find a note in the morning, under his chamber door, from Professor Vance, ask- ing him tQ call for his daughter, as she would have no one to escort her to the boat. To refuse would     132     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. have been uncourteous, but with tact peculiar to him- self, he placed her in one of the most comfortable boats, introduced and put her under the protection of Mr. Henry Kieft, who received her with smiling gra- ciousness, bowed himself off, and in a very few mo- ments after, Adele recognized her brother's voice close behind her, in the same skiff. At a signal given from the shore, every boat start- ed; it was beautiful to the beholders to view the ex- quisite regularity with which each was guided. "How Ravenscroft woul] have enjoyed this," one of the young men remarked; "he was the soul of all pleasure parties-the breeze is invigorating, and there seems a good deal of animation throughout, but I  think, had we not the ladies among us to-day, our sail might be pronounced tolerably dull." They had neared Eagle Island, and the leaders were about turning the point to enter the Bay. "Vancleve, adjust that sail a little," exclaimed young Bryant; "she bears south." Ernest heard not; his eye was gazing on the eastern shore-he arose, and bending far over, he seemed to  be endeavouring to see into the distance. "It is, it ! surely is!" he muttered, rather than spoke. "Adele, i do I see a spirit-is it my imagination? tell me, is there not a figure before us, in Eiseldorf. It moves,  Adele." His sister's eye followed the direction of his finger, j but before she could reply, there was a burst from every boat, which echoed and re-echoed among the A/       ,^            .I   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      133 mountain rocks, until the reverberation was dinning. "Carl!-Carl!--he lives! saved! home!-Ravenscroft on shore-to Eiseldorf-to Eiseldorf. Set sails." In less than a moment, every prow was pointing to- wards- that shore. With one consent, the crapes were torn from every arm, and fluttered a moment, in the wind, then seeking the water, floated swiftly towards the Bay. Ernest sat transfixed, not a word escaped him; his crape alone remained. He saw nothing but the figure on the shore. The carriage of Mr. Ravenscroft had arrived at the shore, and they were admiring the appearance of the boats. As soon as Carl discovered they belonged to the College, he suggested to Cassy the idea of stand- ing on the rocks, as they turned the point, to enjoy the astonishment of the students. Carl was unprepared for this tumultuous manifesta. tion of joy. The students of both schools had gene- rally professed great esteem for him, and he knew, among many, he was a favourite; but that there should be such an exhibition of feeling shown on his reappearance, was far beyond his most distant antici- pations. He bowed and waved his hat at every fresh shout of exultation, but none can tell his delight, when once more folded in the embraces of his dear friends. Ernest Vancleve was not the first foot on the shore, nor the first to receive the warm clasp of the hand of Carl, yet, their rapture when they met, eye to eye, was inexpressible-both shed tears of joy. Carl was the first to speak. 12*     134     IEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "This, I imagine, is one of the black kites my cousin had to account for. Ernest, why may not it seek a home elsewhere?" Ernest glanced at his arm, Cassy untied it, and Carl bid it fly after its companions, as he waved it off into the air. "A joyous finish to our bay trip," observed Theo- dore Clyde; "we shall all be on the tip-toe to hear your marine adventures, Ravenscroft, but the ladies must be at the heights before dinner. So allons." In a little while the boats were filled with glad hearts and cheerful faces. The deep voice of Clyde commenced the air, "'The dark clouds are breaking, the bent bow is here." Soon the rocks sent back their echo to the merry singers, amidst the universal wave of hats and ker- chiefs. The skiff of Ernest still rocked in the cove. "Ernest, dear Ernest," said Carl, "you must go home with me and dine to-day; I long to giveyou an introduction to my friend and deliverer, Captain Blu- cher." "And Adele will spend a few days with us also," said Cassy. "O, yes, dear Miss Adele," said Elsie, affectionately kissing her, " that will be so delightful for us all!" "I think you can hardly resist so much solicitation, Miss Adele," remarked Mr. Ravensoroft, "particu-  i larly when I tell you how much I shall be gratified with such an arrangement." [.   HEHTS OF EIDELBERG.      135 "Solicitation will not be needful," she replied, "it will give me the greatest pleasure. Ernest can re- turn home toward evening, and I am sure mamma will be delighted at my remaining, as she desires change of scene for me." "The carriage is just at hand, Miss Adele; you, must not be fatigued standing. Father will drive you home with my two cousins. Ernest and I will join you in a few moments-0, father, I had forgot- ten to mention that I executed your commission this morning; Mr. and Mrs. Weberstadt will both be with us by two o'clock." Carl and his friend stood in earnest conversation for a little while after the carriage left them, and then slowly proceeded to the house. All was bustle and preparation there; the servants of Mrs. Vandoren were put in requisition also; and the smiling import- ance of Galen, as he performed many little offices for everybody-as he filled no particular department-- was quite amusing. Turkeys, roast and boiled, oyster- pies, ducks, roast beef, and a fine ham, appeared on the table just as the clock struck two, a few minutes after the arrival of the last guest (Dr. Baden); and all parties seemed to enjoy the substantial meal.* This was followed by a substantial dessert, in keeping with the dinner. Mince and apple pies, lemon and potato pudding, together with oranges, apples, and nuts, all placed upon the table at the same time, formed the entire repast. When the meal was over, Mr. Weberstadt was invited to dismiss the table, and     136     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. Mr. Ravenscroft, who was much fatigued, asked per- mission to retire for the purpose of resting; and the guests, in high spirits, returned to the parlour. "Now, Carl," said Dr. Baden, "in your father's absence this seems a fitting opportunity of giving an account of yourself for the last two weeks. I do not think he could bear a recital of particulars, nor is it necessary he should ever hear them. The restoration of his nervous system depends much upon pleasant intercourse without excitement." "As you say, Dr. Baden," replied Carl; "you are his physician, and know best; but are you aware it is his desire that I should give him the full account?" "He overrates his own strength, my son; it might produce serious consequences." "As it is a sad story," said Carl, " will it not throw a gloom over this bright and cheerful group." All expressed a desire to hear the story, and as Carl was about commencing, he hesitated, and looking around, he said, "There is one request I wish to make, to which I have little doubt you will accede- that my two good friends, our domestics, may be per- mitted to come in, and listen to the detail. I know it will be a great gratification to them, as in everything that concerns me they take the deepest interest." "I will answer for a simultaneous consent," replied Dr. Baden. "All who know good Bertrand and Katrine as I do," remarked Mrs. Weberstadt, "would rejoice in giving them any pleasure."   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      137 "I am sure we all would," was reiterated through- out the room. Mrs. Ravenscroft arose, and with an angry counte- nance, and haughty step, left the room, saying to Carl in a low voice as she passed, "So great an inno- vation on the rules of society is an outrage, to which I shall not submit." Carl coloured, but returned no answer; and allow- ing her full time to get to her chamber, he proceeded to the kitchen. Katrine had gone up stairs to make some arrangements for Miss Adele's comfort, but soon came down at Carl's bidding, and, with Bertrand, joined the party in the parlour. Bertrand placed two chairs for them as near the door as possible, at quite a distance from the rest of the group. Carl made no remark, but drawing quite near them, rested his hand on Bertrand's knee. At this moment the door bell rang, and Katrine answered the summons. A fine looking young man entered. "Gustavus Weber!" exclaimed Carl, springing up, and grasping his hand--" how rejoiced I am to see you." "Dear Carl, the first moment I had any tidings of you, I came to greet you. But you have guests," he said, in a low voice-"I am an intruder." "It is an offence to me to hear you call yourself by such a name. Let me introduce you to myfriends-- that is, those with whom you are not already acquaint-     138     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. ed. To Baron Vancleve's family you need no intro- duction." Gustavus, whose eye had been fixed intently on his friend, now looked toward the group; it met that of Adele at the same moment; both started and changed colour-but a slight bow was all the re- cognition. The heart of Adele beat quickly, and Cassy, observing her confusion, with her usual tact handed her a glass of water, making some remark on its limestone properties, and asking her opinion of its wholesome qualities. Adele looked her gratitude, and took the proffered water. Cassy well knew, from her own lips, all the particulars of this attachment. Mr. Weber, seeing Mrs. Vandoren at the other end of the room, advanced to speak to her, and bow- ing to the gentlemen, entered into conversation with Elsie, who was rather separated from the rest of the party by her position on the sofa. Ernest crossed the room to him, but a warm grasp of the hand was the only greeting between them, and he returned to the side of his sister, for whom he felt much con- cerned. "My friend Gustavus, you have arrived just in time to hear the history of Carl's adventures," said the Doctor; "he was about commencing when you en- tered." "Do not let me interrupt it a moment longer," replied Gustavus, stealing an anxious glance at Adele, and then seated himself at the farthest side of the room, beside Carl.   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     139 The seat of Carl had been resumed, and the hand again placed upon the knee of Bertrand. "You will remember, Ernest, our parting, on that eventful Saturday evening." "Remember, Carl! it was a parting to be engraven on my memory for ever." "I saw that you were very anxious; I was selfish in persisting giving you so much pain, but I built too much upon the qualities of my little skiff, and my skill in guiding her. I was not half way across the river before I bitterly repented leaving the shores of Eidelberg. The rain poured in torrents, and the waves rising to a vast height in an incredibly short space of time, rendered my boat almost unmanage- able; the wind, blowing a hurricane, rent my sail into tatters, and I was left entirely dependent upon my oars. With them, I succeeded in springing the waves, as they threatened to engulf me, but could make no headway to either shore, the current bearing me rapidly down the stream, towards the bay. For two hours I kept my boat free from water, but when I found darkness gradually coming upon me, I almost gave myself up to despair. I tried to lift my heart to God, but something seemed to say, 'Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. Have you not thrown yourself into needless danger? Will he give his angels charge concerning you, when you enter into temptation' 'Can you say, Lord save me ' "By this time, thick darkness enveloped me, and my destruction seemed inevitable, when suddenly, a     \ "O     HEIGHTS OF ZIDELBERG. light gleamed upon me, and threw its rays far down the bay. At first, I was dumb with amazement, almost thinking it something supernatural, but be- coming more composed, I endeavoured to discover its origin, and looking to the top of Point Rock, from whence I found it proceeded, I recognized a large lan. tern of our own, fastened in a crevice, which I knew was the work of none other than Bertrand. I watched it eagerly, and saw a figure moving cautiously near it, sometimes it stood erect; at other times I would lose sight of it altogether. I soon observed a horizontal pos- ture was taken by the figure. I guessed the intention -he was scanning the stream for me; hope sprang into my bosom;-I should be saved-I should be at my father's fire-side-in my own comfortable home." A deep groan from Bertand interrupted Carl for a moment, who, turning, pressed his hand affection. ately, and proceeded: "Thinking only of my ex- pected deliverer on the rock, I was careless of present danger, until, by the lightning's flash, I perceived a tremendous wave just upon me. With more than human strength, I overleapt it. Hope gave new* vigour to my frame. The sound of 'Carl, Carl' now faintly reached my ear. I recognized the voice of Bertrand. I endeavoured to make his name resound, but it was lost in the deafening roar of the waters. At this moment, a thunder-clap, such as I never heard before, almost rent the rock asunder, and echoing from hill to hill, made my very heart quake for fear. But I felt that I had now a strong arm,   HEIGHTS OP EIDELBERG.     141 and valiant heart to lean on, and I again tried repeat- ing the name of Bertrand with my whole strength of voice. It was in vain; the wind blowing in a con- trary direction, brought sounds to me, but carried none to him. At length my voice failed-I could not utter a word; but I gazed intently on every motion of the figure. It disappeared; the next moment I heard a clanking of the well-known chain, fastened to Point Rock--I heard a plunge. In my mind, I measured its length; I was far beyond its reach. I struggled to draw nearer, but every wave bore me farther into the Bay. My heart beat violently with intense anxiety-I listened breathlessly for every sound, and my heart was thrilled with the familiar voice of Bertrand, ' Carl! you are safe-thank God!' A lengthened chain was in my imagination; I was only awaiting the strong grasp. of Bertrand, when a feeble cry of 'Help! help!' reached my ear. From that moment the raging waves, and terrific claps of thunder were the only sounds that met me. My feel- ing of horror and desolation now, none could even pic- ture to themselves. I gasped for breath; I tried in vain to utter a sound; a feeling came over me like suffocation; hope had fled-hope that had amounted almost to certainty of safety. Must I die? Must all the loved ones, then, be given up? Must the sun and moon be shut out from my sight for ever? Cover. ing my face with my hands, I sobbed convulsively. Suddenly I became calm; a voice within me seemed 13     '142     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. to say, 'Fear not, I will be with thee. Though the waters compass thee about, they shall not overflow thee.' I felt a peace that truly passed all understand- ing; a joy that cannot be described. At this moment a tremendous wave dashed over me, carrying me head. long with it into the waters. I rose twice to its sur- face, and was about sinking again perfectly exhausted, when I felt a strong hand grasp my hair-my senses forsook me-I knew no more. I must now turn to Captain Blucher to finish the recital." As he concluded, the heads of all were bowed in silence. There was not a sound, except a stifled sob from Elsie. "Elsie, my child," said Dr. Baden, hastily rising, and dashing away from his own eye a tear that had risen unbidden, "Elsie, this will not do; we must only rejoice at Carl's deliverance, and remember he is safe and well." "I fear we are exciting the feelings ofryour little cousin beyond her powers of endurance, said Captain Blucher. Would you not rather, Miss Elsie, we would defer the remainder of the story until you are better?" "O, no, no!" replied Elsie, "I would rather have it now-I am quite able to listen to it." "You are weak, Elsie; I fear I was wrong in allowing you to be present at the recital." "I will be quite composed now," she replied, "but I realized those awful waves in the dark, dark night,   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      143 and it quite overcame me. But the worst is told. I should like to hear Captain Blucher's story." Captain Blucher proceeded: "When I found the wind blowing heavily in the bay, fearing I might be cast upon the shore, I drew my little craft off, intend- ing to put out to sea as soon as possible. As the gale came up so suddenly, I kept a look-out lest some little boat had been caught upon its waters. I swept the whole bay with my spy-glass, but for a long time saw nothing. At length, I espied a speck in the dis- tance; on examining it closely, I discovered a little boat, too frail to belong to any fisherman. There was no sail, and it seemed to be tossing to and fro. Yet I knew it must be under some guidance, or it would have been overturned. I gave orders to bear imme- diately upon it, but losing sight of it the next moment, I feared running it down, and countermanding my direction, remained irresolute how to proceed. I felt that some life was in imminent danger, and I became almost sick with apprehension lest any effort on my part might only bring upon it sure destruction. In a short time we were enveloped in thick darkness, and giving the little boat up as irrevocably lost, I had  some thought of going below. I, however, lingered on the deck, when suddenly I perceived the light of which Carl spoke gleaming down the bay, and, by its rays, I again caught a glimpse of the little boat. I gave the immediate order to lower our long-boat. I, with one of the men, sprang into it, taking the pre-     "4     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. caution to make it fast to the vessel by means of a long rope, that, in case of danger, it might be drawn in by those on board. By the assistance of the light, we were able to keep the boat in view. It was evi- dently guided by a most skilful hand; wave after wave was stemmed, but the fearful one that over. turned his boat threatened to engulf us also. That lantern saved him by its beaming light. I saw him rise, and seized him in the manner he related. At a signal agreed upon, our boat was drawn to the vessel. We carried Carl immediately to the cabin, but, notwithstanding all our efforts, for a long time there was but little sign of returning life. Gradually he was restored; a firm constitution prevailed; and I need,not tell you, said he, smiling, that he is now in a pretty good condition, both of mind and body." "Any expression of our gratitude to you, Captain Blucher," said Mrs. Vandoren, much affected, " would be meagre indeed; for the restoration of our darling boy we owe you a debt of gratitude that can never be repaid." "Believe me, Mrs. Vandoren, instead of feeling that any gratitude is due me, I am truly favoured that I have been the means, under Providence, of impart- ing so much happiness to others, and saving a life so valued, and so valuable." At this moment, Mr. Ravenscroft entered. An introduction to Gustavus Weber followed, and he sat down beside him to make inquiry for those of his re-   HEIGHTS O  EZIDELBERG.     146 lations, once dear to him, who had removed' many years since from Eiseldorf. The conversation now became general. "It is not very easy to leave you, but I must really be crossing the Niese," said Ernest, looking at his watch. "And 1," said Captain Blucher, "have an appoint- ment at five," and shaking hands all round, and pro- mising them frequently to look in at the parsonage, he left them. Dr. Baden accompanied him. "Come, Weber," said Carl, "let us walk with Ernest to the Cove." Gustavus excused himself, preferring to chat with Mr. Ravenscroft. He and the ladies cheerfully ex- cused Carl leaving them. "My garden has not suffered by any means in my absence," observed Carl, as they passed through the gate. "As much cannot be said for the gardenerpro tem.' returned Ernest, smiling. The beaming countenance of Carl told his deep affection and gratitude; there was no other reply. "Yes," continued Ernest, "I worked in that gar- den with an aching heart, there was a void nothing could fill. I endeavoured to conceal my feelings from your father, who spent the two or three last mornings in it with me; his own beautiful submissiveness arrested me; the thought arose, Mr. Ravenscroft is the far greater sufferer, yet how resigned; true, he 13* t  *              "i       "6     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. is sad, very sad, but so unmurmuring. Whence his' composure? The words of a hymn I had so often heard you sing, were continually fastened upon my mind, 'O! where shall rest be found, Rest for the weary soul?' Yesterday morning, as your father parted from. me, he said, 'God bless your labour of love, Ernest. He has gone to fields of living green, Where flowers immortal bloom. There remaineth the same rest for us, Ernest.' His face was illumined, Carl, by holy truth. I felt its reflection. I asked from the recesses of my heart, ! where shall rest be found-rest for the weary soul? He slowly repeated the two following lines: v   'T'were vain the ocean's depths to sound, Or pierce from pole to pole.' Then he added, his manner I cannot describe, yet shall never forget, Ernest, 'The only resting-place for earth's weary pilgrim is at the cross of Christ. He has invited suoh. Our great and only Mediator, he alone can give rest. Believe me, Ernest, believe one who has even found it the fountain head, the unfailing source of consolation, and in this bereave- ment, a solace the world can neither give, neither take away. Ernest will you try my remedy?' I knew the hand he held trembled in his, for my heart   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG;      147  beat hard with the resolutions it was forming.:' Carl, I did resolve, and made the desired promise. Yest on that spot, I determined, and said'to your father,? 'His home shall be my home, and his God shall be my God?'  He blessed me Carl, and we parted. A conversation with President Stuyvezant finished the work. The superstitious errors of my Church, penances, masses, purgatory, fell to pieces, like Dagoti before the ark. The intercession of apostles, angels  saints, and martyrs, sank into insignificance. Mjr stronghold, my faith in the power and supremacy of the blessed Virgin, was shattered to atoms. With a broken heart, and humbled spirit, I laid all my  false belief, my former' errors at the foot of that cross which is all my hope, my only security for sal- vation. Carl, I know I am a Protestant, I trust I am a Christian"-he paused, wiped his brow, sat down on the steps of 4he lower terrace. Carl sat beside him.                      . "Strange I should be amazed," replied the latter after a short silence. It is what I have prayed for daily, and oftener; yet I am-but it does not exceed my delight, Ernest.

To declare my apostasy openly just now, would lead to much misery. I should be sent to Switzer- land. "And in such a result, I should be the greatest martyr," interrupted Carl. "Fear not them that kill the body, Ernest, but work while it is day; the night cometh, how soon, who can tell? Go, stand on yon Papal battlement, and plant the standard of the Cap- tain of the world's salvation. Light the lamp of truth in every dark corridor. It is plainly your duty to spread the glad tidings." "So speaks the Protestant born," replied Ernest, rising, and unclasping the chain which attached his boat to the rock, "but on my present prudence de- pends all my future success. Are we not directed to be wise as serpents, even in our dependence on Almighty power?  Believe me, your counsel has more of zeal than knowledge, Carl; the premature exposure of my views would add gloom to the present darkness in yon College, and bind upon her additional fetters; all communication between the schools would be at once suspended. Whatever my example might effect, would be prevented by my banishment from Eidelberg. Be assured, only by a gradual develop- ment of my changed views, will be accomplished our desired end. Are you convinced, Carl?" "The;e always was power in your reasoning, Er- nest. The Lord direct you aright." The hook fell, Ernest silently clasped the &xtended hand, and before Carl had reached the top of the   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. @     149' rock, the boat was nearing the opposite shore. Slowly he retraced his steps; "What wonders has the last fortnight accomplished," he exclaimed, and, without seeming to be aware of what he was doing, he threw grape after grape from a bunch he had plucked from a wild vine, twining among the hills, watching the dimples, and then the circles, as each expanded upon the waters. He saw the last grape sink, but his thoughts were far distant; his busy brain was col- lecting the strange transactions of the period of his absence. The garden gate he found open; the brown stick had fallen, and the twine connecting the Elysium to it loosened by the fall. With a presentiment, natural to the German mind, particularly to the youth- ful, he saw the foreboding of evil. With hasty ner- vousness, he seized a stone, and with it planted the tall stick firmly in the ground, bound the strings again around it. Turning from it, with a deep sigh, he murmured-"Sweet Elsie will droop indeed, de- prived of this support." There was an undefinable apprehension of trouble for Elsie, with which he associated the President of the Papal College. He entered; Mr. Vonberg was there. "Which way did you come up from the river, Carl?" inquired that gentleman, "I thought Point Rock was your favourite landing." "Ernest started from James' Cove," returned Carl, coldly, " and I must apologize for my long stay, Van- cleve and I became interested in our subject, and both overstayed our time. Are you not fatigued,     150     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERO. Miss Adele," he continued, drawing a chair near her. "No, Carl, this chair seems made for weary bones, I have not yet thought of feeling tired." "It is comfortable; it belonged to my mother; she frequently remarked on its soothing qualities, and preferred it, for a siesta, to her couch." "How well you remember your mother, cousin." "Remember her, Cassy! I had her six years, and was her constant little companion during her pro- tracted sickness." "My mother was her intimate friend, I have heard her say," remarked Adele. "Yes, until the change in my mother's religious views separated them, as my father has since told me; you are aware my mother was by birth a Ro. manist, Miss Adele." "I knew that, but did not know there was any estrangement in consequence. Mamma still speaks of her as one of the most perfect of her race, and never has alluded to their difference in religious opinions." "I regret I did then; Ernest and myself have always been as brothers, though we were opposed in our belief of what was truth or error many years." Cassy saw the colour deepen on the cheek of Adele, and asked Carl what the boys had done with the Sea Bird, to change the now unpleasant topic. True, Cassy," he exclaimed, I must find out; she has been a very pleasant Bird to me, and will no  \   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      151 doubt be, once more and again. I shall be careful not to try her so hard in future." Coffee was now brought in, with some light biscuit. Dr. Vonberg accepted the invitation to remain, and Mrs. Ravenscroft took the head of the table, and attended to her guests with a grace natural to her; nothing occurred to disturb her equanimity; she was really an elegant woman. The conversation, led by Mr. Ravenscroft, flowed cheerfully; and Dr. Vonberg was telling an interest- ing incident relating to some of the students, when the whole party was startled by the most joyful vocife- rations from the lungs of little Galen, He shouted, hurrahed, jumped, and clapped; yet gave no intelli- gible idea of the occasion of his noise. To follow him was the universal impulse. "No wonder he screeched," cried Dr.. Baden, re- turning; and hastily throwing a shawl over Elsie, raised her on his strong arm, and was off again in a moment. No one waited for the other, and the sight was as splendid as unexpected. Bonfires had been made on the tops and sides of the hills, wherever they could be seen from Eiseldorf. Some of them seemed to blaze into the very clouds, others glittered bril- liantly into the stream. "I feel so delighted, cousin," said Cassy, "that you are the subject of so much honour." "I am glad you are delighted, Cassy, but I feel humbled at being so undeservedly exalted; but you   i will assuredly take cold." Then gently releasing his      152     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. arm from hers, he took from his pocket a neck- warmer, for which he sometimes found occasion in boating. Placing it over her head, he wound it round her throat, fastening it nicely under her chin. "There now, you are safe from harm," he said, drawing her hand through his arm again. "Carl, you have consideration to the last degree- how often am I to be indebted to your forethought?' "My cousin is very grateful for trifles," was the reply. "Life is made up of trifles, Carl; great deeds fly over oceans, traverse both continents, then die a natural death, are buried up, and forgotten. To en. lighten a fellow-student in an arithmetical difficulty- make a Greek translation quite easy to another-give peace of mind to troubled beginners in the Classics- these, and many other such like trifles, go right into the heart, and have been the origin of all these joyful greetings so pleasant to behold this evening. I an- ticipate your inquiry 'Who informed you on these points?'-and answer, half the Freshmen, and plenty of Sophomores too, now engaged in making a public blaze in token of their gratitude and joy at your re- turn. See, Carl, there is a rocket-how beautiful!" Rockets now flew in quick succession. "It is ten minutes after eight," observed Vonberg, "I wonder what is the cause of their delay?" "The gentleman seems perplexed about some- thing," whispered Carl; "I am sure he has never been my debtor or creditor for little or great favours."   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      153 "There!" exclaimed Vonberg-" was not that well done!" As if by magic, every bonfire was extinguished, and, at the very same moment, every window facing Eiseldorf was illuminated; they burned brightly nearly an hour, the bells ringing merrily "Welcome Home." As the last light was put out, the gratified party, after receiving gratulations of friends, and the blessings of the peasantry who had collected on the shore, returned to their home. When the others left the parlour, Gustavus Weber, perfectly aware Miss Vancleve was unable to undergo any fatigue, remained behind to arrange a window toward the river, in order that she might have a full view also. Adele, not aware of the presence of Gustavus, had walked slowly to another window, and seated herself before it. Her ear was attracted by a light footstep, and turning, Gustavus Weber stood before her. "Fearing you would not be equal to much exertion, Adele," he said, in answer to her look of inquiry, "I thought a good view might be obtained from the  window. Let me give you this chair; you will find it more comfortable than the one you are occupying." "Do not let me detain you here, Gustavus," she replied, trying to conceal her emotion.  "Allow me to remain with you, Adele; an inter- view I have been seeking anxiously since my return  to Eidelberg without success." "Were you not aware that I was here, Gustavus?" " f !- '      151     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "So far from it, I declined the sail, fearing you would be prevented going, and supposed you had re- turned home with the party." "You lift a burden from me; I feared it was con- certed with Ernest." "No; I was told of Carl's return by Philip Baden, and came immediately over, for no other purpose than seeing him. But I believe it was arranged by Pro. vidence that I should see you also." "Do not say so, Gustavus; it cannot be. It is much better there should be no intercourse; my father's commands are absolute." "Say, rather, the commands of Dr. Ostend," he replied, bitterly. "He is the bane of my life; he has poisoned the fountain of my hope, and made me the most miserable of men. Will you yield to such authority as this, Adele?' "I acknowledge no authority but parental, Gusta- vus. In this I am guided by that book which you profess to take as a lamp to your path. Can I read the fifth commandment of the law proclaimed from Sinai, and disobey my parent?" "That parent is unconsciously standing in the way of your happiness; his eyes are blinded by prejudice, which an enlightened conscience like yours surely cannot approve." "His word has always been my law, and always shall be, whatever may be the result in regard to my own happiness." "You forget, Adele, the happiness of another is   HEIGHTS OP EIDELBERG.     155 involved in your decision. It is selfish, worse than selfish, thus to trifle wit the feelings of one who would willingly lay down his life for you. In six months I am of age; my large property then comes into my own hands, with my homestead, the old chateau. You know it needs a mistress. I have neither parent nor sister to occupy it with me; I shall be desolate indeed." "Gustavus, would you be a tempter to me? Have I not shown the sincerity of my attachment to you? Am I not fading out of life? Is it necessary to increase my sufferings? Until that command is blotted out, or we obtain my father's consent, I can be no other than Adele Vancleve." Gustavus walked the floor rapidly, in silence, for some time; at length, stopping before her, he said, "I will again see your father, Adele; I will show him his injustice. Yes!" he added, in a tone almost of despair, "I will unmask that hypocrite, Ostend, I will." "Stop, Gustavus, take that step and all hope of our union is at an end. Leave matrs to Ernest." "Will you abide by his decision?" "Not altogether; he looks too much to the influ- ence of Father Antoine, and partially forgets the duty to parents."  "I have one request to make, Adele; do not deny me so small a boon. I intend spending three days on this side of the river; shall I see you each day while here?"     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. Adele drew a long breath, shook her head, but ?poke not. " Is it then denied me ?" "Act as conscience ought to dictate, Gustavus. Pray over it; keep filial duty full in view; let the Bible guide you, and not your own feelings, in this matter." While she spoke, Gustavus stood, his eyes resting upon the floor. As she finished, taking her hand in both of his, he said, very solemnly, "Adele, for four years I have endeavoured to make that Bible the rule for all my actions; and there is no command more deeply engraven on my heart than filial obedience. Three years since, when standing at my father's dying bed, to receive his blessing, overwhelmed with sorrow, I begged to be forgiven, if I had in any instance ever offended him. 'My son,' was his reply, 'your obedi- ence has been the greatest comfort of my life. In making a retrospect, this morning, I could not remem- ber one act by which you wilfully disobeyed me.' I speak not this boastingly, but to show you my appre- ciation of the fifth commandment. But, Adele, had my father been cursed with such spiritual advisers as Ostend, or Weisse, my course would have been far different. You forget that the Bible, in giving this command, adds, 'in the Lord.'" " Gustavus, am I right in listening to temptation?" "Here me to the end, Adele. I could conscien- tiously visit you here, see you daily, hourly, even without consent; and, (0, that I could induce you!)   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBEGR  .        157 in the fear of God, with the clearest conscience, lead you to the altar, and have our union irrevocably sealed." "Gustavus Weber!" exclaimed Adele, endeavour- ing to release her hand from the grasp in which he closely held it, "let not even such thoughts intrude upon you; at least, do not sully my ear with them." "Adele, listen one moment longer to me. Is my happiness to be sacrificed for ever? Is your health to be undermined? Are you to find an early grave, and leave me desolate-the most miserable of men? Take but this step, these Jesuit priests would then know their interference could no longer avail, and the affection of your father would rise beyond all other feeling. Your health would soon return, and I should be the happiest of men, blessed with such a treasure." "Again I say, Gustavus, I am resolved, whatever it may cost me, my parents must be the arbiters between us. Until their consent be obtained, we had better never meet. Should it be withheld, I at least shall have the happiness of knowing I have done my duty towards them." The hand of Adele fell from the firm grasp of Gus- tavus, and turning from her, he slowly paced the apartment, with folded arms and bowed head-he seemed almost to forget her presence. Her eye was fixed upon him, but agitation pre- vented her again speaking.     158     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. They were soon interrupted by the entrance of Dr. Baden, carrying Elsie. "Do you not think, Miss Vancleve, one needs a strong arm, when it is forced to bear such a burden?" Gustavus started, Adele endeavoured to rally, but their confusion was very obvious to a close observer, such as Dr. Baden, and without further remark, he called Katrine, giving her directions to put her little charge to bed, and take care to wrap her up warmly, to prevent her taking cold after this undue exposure, and, after shaking hands with his friends, took his leave. The whole party soon came in, and the guests, after uniting in worship, took their leave, and the family separated for the night. Adele was struck with the appearance of the cham- ber allotted for her, as she entered it. "This is com- fort," she remarked to Katrine, who followed her, to see whether she could render her any assistance. "Miss Cassy has often told me, Katrine, that every thing you touched turned into comfort, like the philo- sopher's stone, that turned all things into gold." "I hope Miss Cassy's report of me has more foun- dation than the other story, the philosopher looked in vain, you know, for his riches." Adele was surprised at the answer, although com- monplace, there was a refinement about it that she scarcely expected from one placed in a menial station, and she then fully comprehended why the touch polite was given by Katrine, which rendered everything so inviting.   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     159 A small fire was burning upon the hearth, merely to rempve the dampness, and a polished brass fender placed; closely around it. The green shutters were bowed to exclude the bright rays of the eastern sun in the morning; the long dimity curtains, with deep fringe, were drawn gracefully to one side, and fas- tened with a crimson silk cord and tassel; the bed- curtains were arranged in a similar manner, the milk. white spread was also trimmed with fringe of the same workmanship. A divan covered with dimity with three large cushions upon it, was drawn from the recess partly across the fire, an Afghan thrown across the foot; every thing was perfectly plain-- bookcase, wardrobe, bureau, wash-stand, and chairs, all being made of maple. On the other side of the. fire-place stood a large old-fashioned easy-chair, also covered with dimity. A few choice books lay upon the table, with a small silver waiter beside them, con- taing a plate of biscuit and some wine, which Ka. trine had learned from Cassy was necessary for the invalid. "I have never had so home a feeling outside of the chateau she remarked, as she kissed asy good night."  "Mamma and I are in the room adjoining, with the door between; should you have a fancy for any home comforts, a little tap against the wall will soon procure them." The home comforts, however, were not needed, as the sun had risen far above the horizon before Adele     160     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. roused from her slumbers, refreshed and strength- ened. "Why, Cassy," said she, with her eyes half open, as her friend peeped laughingly upon her, through the communicating door, which was standing duce sleep? I scarcely expected to close my eyes, and the morning light surprised me before I was con- scious of settling myself comfortably." tI cannot tell," repliedg assyo every one maes the same comlo plaint of le's house; for myself tell him it might literally be called :the stranger's dres rapidly, and shall not be ready for se time. home,' for all have a honme feeling at once, and can- "Shall I then mae your apology, Ade Ae not tell to'what to attribute it; but come, Adele, it is almost time for prayers, I fear we shall be too late if we loiter chatting, and I think the delightful worship here, shedding such a cheerful spirit through the household, is perhaps th e sourc e of all t he harm that is so strikihg to every one. Adele coloured deeply. i Do not wait for me, Gassy," she said, c I do not dress rapidly, and shall not be ready for some time." c Shall I then make your apology, Adele?" The blood mounted to the brow of Adele, while she answered, " cannot tell my duty, Gassy; my in- clination and my Bible prompt me to go with you, but my father, I fear--indeeld, I know it would not be in accordance with his wishes. Whatwouldyou ad- vise me to do?" "iI am not fitted to advise, Adele; but I heard this very subject discussed some time since, and the   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     161 answer of uncle Eldrid was this-'In the words of the Apostle I would say, 'Whether is it right in the sight of God to obey God rather than men, judg eye.'  Adele said nothing, and Cassy returned to complete her toilet. In about fifteen minutes Adele tapped gently at the door. "I will go with you, Cassy; are you ready?" "How rejoiced I am, dear Adele," she replied, kissing her cheek affectionately; "this decision may be the turning point of your life, and tell on your destiny for time and eternity." "Pray, Cassy, that I may be able to see clearly my duty to my heavenly as well as earthly parent." A warm pressure of the hand was the only answer. At the head of the stairs they were met by Carl, who, giving Adele his arm, they slowly proceeded to the study. The kind, benignant smile of Mr. Ravens- croft, as he advanced to meet her, almost made her forget she was treading forbidden ground. "You look pale this morning, my dear Miss Van- cleve; I fear your sleep was not as refreshing as when at the chateau." "Indeed! Mr. Ravenscroft, I slept delightfully; but will you allow me to ask that Miss may be thrown aside; with you, I would rather be Adele." Mr. Ravenscroft only smiled, and Mrs. Vandoren arranged a cushion nicely on the corner of the sofa for her. Adele's home-feeling was unaccountable, even to herself. Was she indeed in the house of almost strangers?     162     HEGHTS OF EIDELBERG. Elsie at this moment entered, and with one of her brightest smiles sat down beside her, and clasped her hand closely in her own. Adele was not conscious before of her extreme beauty; her mother had great taste, and endeavoured to repair the loss of the hair by a tastefully arranged cap, so becoming that it had been quite a matter of dispute whether it was not rather an ornament than disadvantage. "Mamma begs to be excused this morning," said Elsie; "she will not be down until breakfast time, as she has some headache." The bell was touched by Mrs. Vandoren; Bertrand and Katrine appeared, and quietly took their seats. Mr. Ravenscroft read that beautiful hymn, "The Lord is my Shepherd." The rich, full voice of Carl, mingled with the sweet notes of Mrs. Vandoren, the warbling of Cassy, with the full bass of Mr. Ravens- croft, entranced Adele, and her imagination roved to those sweet strains which angels use. Psalm xxiii. was then chosen, "The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want." When he came to the fourth verse, the head of Adele sank. Could she in. deed, in the midst of all trouble, feel such implicit trust? In her present situation could she be quite happy?  Could she resign Gustavus? The duty, if it were a duty, seemed harder than ever. If it were a duty-that doubt had never before arisen--she en- deavour to shake off such a suggestion, but- it was impossible; her mind wandered into the future; she was the mistress of the Weber chateau, kneeling at   HEIOHTS OF EIDELBE RG.       3 the family altar with Gustavus, both the happiest of beings; her health restored, and the days gliding in rapid succession. Then the fifth commandment stood before her, 'Thou shalt honour thy father and thy mother." Her whole mind was absorbed, when the "Let us pray" of Mhr. Ravenscroft roused her from her reverie; she was shocked that the sacred words of Scripture had been unheeded.. She knelt, and with great effort recalled her wandering thoughts. What heartfelt earnestnesswaspoured forth in that prayer!-how different from the cold, unmeaning forms of Father Antoine! Her own case seemed to be laid before the throne of grace; those who were in circumstances of doubt and dii culty; whose way was pent up, and wh  o saw no light. Mr. Ravenscroft had, in her view, faith almost equal to sight, and she felt it would be answered. When she arose from her knees her faith was strengthened, and she had clearer views of duty. She felt this act of disobedience to her parents she had consienti usly performed , and determined also to obtain a Bible, to make it her daily study, notwithstanding all injunctions to the contrary. Thi   s was clearly her duty , as it regarded her salvation, and she determined to let nothing inter- fere with her effort to fin d h er Saviour. On other points, p nts  ts that only affected h er temp oral h appi. ness, duty w  as not quite so lear; but she resoledto leave all in the hands of her Saviour    to will, and be bettr ,tedr Ofit d fo- .Byhi. resolve, a burden was removed from he  r -on sien e,     164     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. the religious fetters which had bound her was loosed, and the cheerful manner in which she now conversed delighted Mr. Ravenscroft, who had noticed her sad- ness the evening before, and felt concerned that care should be written upon the brow of one so young and lovely. After breakfast, all was hurry and bustle, as Ka- trine said, "to get things to rights." Mr. Ravens- croft retired to his study, and Carl was soon busily engaged making some little improvements in his gar- den. Cassy, after arranging the pillows nicely for Adele, and insisting upon her reclining a little while, after the fatigue she had undergone, took upon her- self the wiping of the breakfast things, while Katrine washed them, while Elsie, seating herself in a large arm-chair, commenced working a pair of shoes, in- tended for Carl, as a surprise present, by Christmas. Mrs. Vandoren had gone to make some house ar- rangements, and Mrs. Ravenscroft had retired to her chamber to await the arrival of Miss Vonberg, who had invited her to ride. The three young ladies were conversing pleasantly in the parlour when the voice of Dr. Baden was heard. "Where are the young ladies, Katrine?  Come little girls; I am going to visit a patient some .five miles off, through a beautiful country. Get your bonnets quickly. It will do you all good, and I shall be quite set up with such pleasant company. Miss Adele, you are looking better this morning; let   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBEG.      165 Cassy bring down your things, and save you the walk up. Plent of warm shawls, Cassy, and I have your nice present, my little Afghan, for the feet of our invalids, on the back seat. As for you and I, Cassy we are not afraid of braving a little cold air." They were all soon  quipped, and, without the slightest ceremony, Adele found herself the willing occupant of the Protestant Doctor's Ce  who until the day before, was an entire strger to her, lbut with whom she already felt perfectly well acquainted. Carl assisted them into the carriage, wishing them a pleasant ride. "I am sorry I have no seat to offer you, Carl, I do not like to be an object of so much envy to you." Thank you, Doctor, I could not accompany you conveniently this morning; I have made an engage- ment with aunt Meggy and father, to pay several visits on the other side of the river. Iam very desir- ous also, of seeing my friends at the College."- ' Well! well! Carl," he replied, but there is one thing I  want you to remember; I have no doubt such a lion will have many invitations to exhibit himself. 'You have a prior engagement to dine w ith m e to morrow. W   e are going to feed you a I a Ravens- croft. I admired  your father's independence, and am determined to adopt it.

So saying, the old gentleman jumped into the seat beside Cassy, gave his horse the rein, and they were soon far on their road to Mrs. Vanklapp's, the patient of whom "I h ope we are included in this said invitation to- morrow, Doctor," said Cassy. "Included! Who ever heard of Dr. Baden over- looking the ladies? Yes, my child, Elsie, and Miss Adele here, I shall take in the carriage myself. I hope you have no other engagement, Miss Vancleve?" "4None, whatever, Dr. Baden," she replied, run- ning at once into the spirit of his sociability, and de- lighted with his kind, fatherly manner. "I shall be gratified to accept your kind offer." The air was invigorating, and the country looked particularly beautiful to the invalids. When at home, Adele was deprived of the pleasure of riding, owing to the hilly country, which, of course, rendered the roads exceedingly rough. At Eiseldorf, much pains had been taken to level them, and the one Dr. Baden had now purposely chosen was almost as smooth as velvet. As they emerged from a thick wood, they came in sight of the dwelling of Mrs. Vanklapp. ," You are acquainted with this worthy woman, are you not, Cassy? she is only one mile from you." "Perfectly well, and mamma often visits her." As they drew near the door, the reins were thrown to Cassy, and the Doctor, promising to return in a   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      167 short time, disappeared. In a few moments, how- ever, he came back, accompanied by Mrs. Vanklapp. Her invitation was so pressing that Miss trandoren and her friends should alight, it could not be refused, and they were soon all seated in a neat little parlour, chatting to two pleasant little children, and refreshing themselves with some cool water which Jemmy brought for them from the spring. "How pleasant everything looks here, Mrs. Van- klapp," remarked Cassy. "The Lord has been truly good to us, Miss Cassy, he has always raised us up friends in our distress. In our greatest need, he sent his own servant to min- ister to our wants, and he has indeed plentifully sup- plied them. He was here only a few minutes ago, on his way to his uncle's, Baron Kieft, and brought the children each a little book, with which they are high- ly delighted. Mr. Weber's kindness to us is un- bounded." Adele's head-immediately bent low,in apparent in- terest over the little book. Mrs. Vanklapp continued, "he has been a guar- dian angel to us; supplied every want of my sick hus- band, paid our rent, and since his death, has fur- nished these two rooms neatly for us, and allows me a sum, monthly, on which, he says, I may always de- pend." "Yes," replied Dr. Baden, "with his large income, many a young man would be ruined; but instead of spending it upon himself, I know of, at least, twenty     168     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. families, whom he nearly maintains. His income, of course, never increases, that is, in gold or silver, but he 'casts his bread upon the waters,' and he. will surely gather a rich reward. But come, ladies, Don becomes restive, if left too long standing. Good-by, Mrs. Vanklapp, you are so much better you will not need me for a few days. Can you tell me how long Mr. Weber will remain with his uncle?" "He said he would allow himself just time to get to College on Friday morning." "I am truly sorry Gustavus is not here," said the Doctor, as he drove from the door of Mrs. Vanklapp; "I had hoped to have added him to the number of my guests to-morrow. He is a noble young man, that very Gustavus. When he first came to these parts, four years since, he brought a letter from his father to me, asking me to have an oversight of his son, to watch over him, and guard him, as far as I could, from the temptations inctdent to college life. I did so, as far as lay in my power; made many in- quiries relative to him of the Professors, and have yet to hear anything but commendation. Once a week he has regularly dined with us, but, on the Sabbath, he always remains at College, as the Episcopal church with which he is connected, is in Eidelberg. His father, Frederic Gustavus Weber, was one of my warmest friends." Adele's cheek glowed with pleasure; it was ob- served by Cassy only. The Doctor continued: "4 Gustavus has an uncom-   HEIGHTS OF EIDEBE   .     69 Monely bright temperament. Lately, there seems to be rather a cloud over his spirits; but he is atrue child of God, a man of prayer; all will be well with him, I have no doubt." "How beautifully the Niese flows around this spot," remarked Cassy, anxious to change the subject, fear- ing some painful cordmight be touched-, and the scenery!--can anything be moreperfect? Thosehills on the opposite side, almost mountain high, sloping down to the water's edge!-..and the trees, forming a complete woods, on their brow and sides!" "Yes," answered Adele, t and the houses, large and small, of every hue, seem to be thrown in among them.

"They were then only on a visit," replied Adele; "now they are coming for the purpose of attending school. Kate is to return with her father at the end of the week; the boys only are to remain. I hope they will not be quite so wild." "What are their ages?" asked the Doctor. "Twelve and fourteen," was the reply. "Tut! tut! too old to be skittish-must make them better, Miss Adele." "My influence will not be much, I am but little with them. Uncle Nicholas builds much upon the example of Ernest for them; they will go with him to and from school." "By example much may be effected, but it must be followed by sincere prayer." "I know it, Dr. Baden, I know it," Adele replied, as she leaned upon his arm up the avenue towards the house, " and I realize daily, more and more, how little can be done in our own strength." "You will never realize it too much, daughter. Just roll all your troubles upon the cross; you will need no other strength. We will talk more on this subject to-morrow. Good-by, children," he called to Cassy and Elsie, who were before-" to-morrow, at two o'clock, you may expect me." Adele watched the carriage from the parlour win- dow until it was out of sight. "What are you watching there so closely, Adele?" said Cassy, laying her hand playfully on her shoulder;   HEIGHTS OF EIYBMBG.      171 "do you see horsemen in the distanoe, and does your life depend on their approach?" "I should be sorry to think, Cassy, the horseman I have been watching would never again approach; his very horse must love him more than they would a common master. What a man!-what a soul! How I wish he were my doctor; even sickness would be more easily borne with such a friend and comforter. I feel better now for his few impressive words. Cassy, life must indeed be sweet to you!" "It is, Adele; my comforts are many, and great indeed." "Would that I had been a Protestant born", thought Adele; but it was only a silent wish. She thought of Father Antoine; contrasted him with Mr. Ravenscroft, and Dr. Bryant with Dr. Baden; an involuntary sigh escaped her. "You are tired, Adele; shall I take you to your own chamber to rest?" "No, Cassy, I will recline upon this lounge. Sup- pose you sing me one of those sweet airs I so much lode." Cassy took her guitar from the case, and seating herself beside Adele, commenced playing. "That is an exquisite air, Cassy; has it no words?" Yes-the words far exceed the music. It is a favourite hymn at our weekly lecture." Cassy com- menced warbling- "My heart shall triumph in the Lord, And bless his works, and bless his word;     172     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. Thy works of grace, how bright they shine; How-deep thy counsels! how divine! But I shall share a glorious part, When grace hath well refined my heart, And fresh supplies of joy are shed, Like holy oil, to cheer my head "Then shall I hear, and see, and know, All I desired or wished below; And every power find sweet employ, In that eternal world of joy." The words sank into the soul of Adele; the part. ing counsel of Dr. Baden, "Roll your sorrows upon the cross," had made a deep impression upon her, and she had determined to follow his advice impli- citly, to take all her sins and cares to Jesus-to go just as she was, and rest entirely upon him. These words, therefore, seemed framed for her; she appro- priated them to herself-she made each stanza her fervent petition: she took Jesus for her Saviour, and in the same hour found that "Peace which passeth all understanding, that joy in believing, that hope, that confidence, that perfect love which casteth out fear." As Gassy closed the book, she remarked, "The bosom of Jesus would indeed be a sure refuge." "Sure indeed," was the reply, "truly a 'covert' from every storm." Gassy raised her head in surprise, the expression of Adele's countenance was almost heavenly. "Cassy," she almost whispered, "I have entered   HEIGHTS OP EIDELBERG.      173 into a covenant- with my Maker, he has accepted me, just as I am, all covered o'er with sin he has said to me, 'Fear not, it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.'" They wept together--wept tears of oy. Elsie's head was buried in the lap of Gassy, but delicacy pre- vented her speaking. The heart of this young disciple of Jesus rejoiced that one whom she had already learned to love had also devoted herself to her pre- cious Saviour. For a long time there was perfect stillness. At length Cassy struck a chord of the guitar she had been carelessly holding, accompanying it with her voice, "Lord, obediently we go, Gladly leaving all below; Only thou our leader be, And we still will follow Thee." Then rising, she crossed the room, placed the instru- ment in its case, and offering her arm to Adele, they proceeded slowly up stairs. After partly closing the shutters, she stirred the dying embers, placed a few sticks upon them, and drawing the divan a little nearer to it, she kissed Adele affectionately, and passed into her own cham- ber. Elsie went into the kitchen, to see her dear friend Katrine, and communicate to her the glad intelli- gence. Katrine received the news with unfeigned joy, but cautioned Elsie to let it spread no further, as     174     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. Miss Adele was a Romanist, and it might lead to trouble. "Well! that is indeed news to me, Katrine; her father and mother love her very much; would they not rejoice that she would have a home in heaven, if she died? Adele is very sick." "They have their own notions about these things, Elsie; you must ask your uncle, or Carl; they will tell you all about it." Adele, much fatigued, sank into a sound sleep, from which she did not rouse until long after the return of the party from Eidelberg. Cassy listened several times at the partly closed door, but finding it all perfectly quiet, she descended to the parlour, where she found her mother, uncle, and cousin, dis- cussing a point, apparently of much interest. "Just in time, cousin Cassy," said Carl, "to help us unravel a knotty point. We rather differ as to the mode of expressing gratitude to Captain Blucher. I have six hundred rix thalers laid by, two years' interest from my capital, which sum we all agree shall be disposed of in that vessel. My suggestion is to divide two hundred among the subordinates, and buy something handsome with the remaining four hundred for the Captain." "O, yes," replied Elsie, who had entered unob- served, "a splendid silver pitcher, or tea-service, or goblet, with his name engraved in full." Mr. Ravenscroft smiled. "Gold coins to the amount of four hundred, would be of far more service to a   HEIGHTS OF EDELBERG.      175 man with three little children, receiving the small sum of fifty rix thalers a month. Of what use would a silver pitcher be to him?" "No, father, my idea is something serviceable; what, I cannot tell exactly. Some good book on navi- gation, or a chronometer, or a splendid compass." Mr. Ravenscroft shook his head. "My idea about the matter is this," said Mrs. Van- doren. "Let two hundred rix thalers be divided among the crew; let Carl just go to the boat, and pay them as a business transaction. Let gold coin then be obtained for the four hundred, and presents sent with it for the family. I will provide a silk dress for Mrs. Blucher; Cassy and Elsie shall send some hand- 'ome toys for the children. Before it is sent, your rather and I will make a sociable call, and invite irs. Blucher to visit us.". CHAPTER VI. "My soul, look well around thee, Ere thou give thine infant unto sorrows; Yet there be boisterous tempers, Stout nerves, and stubborn hearts."

'It would be very pleasant to me, mother; but I am at loss for an excuse to Professor Vance. He is to deliver his Introductory to-day, and has taken the trouble to send me word; he cannot miss me there. I have always avoided popular lectures; I do not see why he so much desires my attendance on his. Shall I stop at Mike's? At what hour will you be ready?" "At one o'clock precisely; but I am really disap- pointed you cannot go." "I imagine I shall be through with Father Basil before then; if so, I will accompany you myself. "That is more than I would have asked or ex- pected, Lorenzo. I supposed condolence was all that could carry you to the house of Mr. Ravenscroft. I am very sorry there is this barrier to our social iter- course; could the Churches only agree to disagree, the members of both might have more friendliness of feeling and social feeling. My late visits, though very few, have revived many sweet associations; Mrs. Van- doran is perfectly charming, and Cassy seems so to love our Adele." "It is about as easy for 'a camel to go through the eye of a needle,' as for papa to oppose you, mother," said Ernest, laughing; "yet I am very confident a repetition of his call at the Manse will have more influence in gaining him over, than any reasoning. "It is that captivating influence which induces my fears, my son. Carl Ravenscroft is considered almost faultless in the school; and I am not prepared to dis pute this opinion, from my own personal acquaintance   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      1" with him. And who is superior to Gustavus Weber, Ernest? I have vanity enough to suppose my chil- dren would not be fascinated by other than those of elevated standing, morally and intellectually; yet it is melancholy to a father, to behold those born and faithfully instructed in the doctrines of the only true Church, to be enchained in the wiles of heresy." "Here comes the apply of my eye, the jewel of the house of Vancleve, the beauty of the homestead, my precious little sister!" and, catching Cassy from Bertha, Ernest turned the conversation, by a stream of unqualified praises of this model of all babies. "The Vancleves always look on their own through perfection glasses," said his mother, with a bright smile; "I guess Cassy is pretty much like all other little girls." "No, indeed, mamma; I take notice of all I meet, and she is totally different. She plays so joyously, and yet so gently; is so perfectly willing to remain still, if required, and never out of temper." "Her brother never allows her temper to be tried," observed the mother; "the other little girls of Eidel- berg have not the advantages of Ernest Vancleve's sister." Ernet coloured a little, and only said, Who is for their own, now, mother?" "Well, you are a pattern son and brother, Ernest," she replied, kissing his forehead, as she lifted Cassy from his knee. '"As your father intends crossing the 16     178     HEIGHTS OF IEIDELBERG. river, we will take this paragon. Would you love to see sister, dear?" c See sister? Yes, indeed!"And clasping her arms round her mother's neck, she kissed her over and over "We must take Bertha, then; go tell her, little dear."c "No, no," said the Baron, laughing; "Iwill be nurse, and feel it quite a privilege, after her bro- ther'ss encomiums. What do you think of yourself, Cassy?" "I am the darling child of all the Heights. Papa says so." "8 Caught in my own trap," said her father, taking her chin between his fingers, and fondly kissing her. "Ernest, as you are going to the lecture, you had better take the carriage for some of the young ladies; you are not the bean you are expected tobe. There is Miss Vance-some youths of eighteen would be captivated by such beauty; you have had opportunity of judging-is she not very agreeable. "I suppose so, father; as much so as most young ladies; I like the society of all ladies-no one par- ticularly." Ernest is his father over again," observed Lady Vaucleve; " you used to express your entire satisfac- tion with the life of a bachelor 'so long as yogi home held two such sisters,' yet a certain Henriette Oberlin changed -your views." "And he never has had the slightest reason to it A. heneve   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      179 regret the change, much as he loves those sisters," replied the Baron, with such a rich smile of sincere affection." "Well, when Imeet with a Henriette Oberlin, she shall share my heart with Adele and Cassy. So now for the carriage and the ladies." Then picking up for his little sister a pencil she had dropped, and stopping to hear her "Thank you, brother," Ernest left the room. "What a labyrinth I am in with regard to that boy," observed Baron Vancleve. "I am to meet Father Basil this morning relative to pursuance of measures best adapted to recall his wanderings, and I shrink from what may, perhaps, be my duty." "The spirit of our son will never yield to coercive treatment. I am an enigma to myself, Lorenzo. After a conversation with our clergyman, I feel the salvation of our boy depends on our strenuous efforts, and am excited to make any sacrifices; an interview with Ernest almost allays my fears for him, and I cannot but contrast his frank nobleness of character with the reverse in our advisers. Lorenzo"-she lowered her voice to a whisper-"I have doubted more than once the policy of obliging Ernest to give up that Book." "No!" exclaimed the Baron vehemently, "the 'same idea has been tormenting me, but I have tried to put it away as a suggestion of Satan; our course is very difficult, Henriette." "It is; but do not commit yourself by any promise gill     180     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBELG. to Father Basil; with the most holy motives, we have, by the advice of our clergy, embittered the life of a darling daughter ;"I could not see the noble spirit of Ernest crushed." A ring at the hall door admonished Baron Vancleve that his visitor had arrived. Laying little Gassy, who had gone to sleep in his arms, on the sofa, and promising his wife he would be very careful, with a heavy heart he repaired to the library. Michael came with the carriage punctually at one o'clock. At fifteen minutes before two, Baron Van- cleve rang for admittance at the door of the manse. Mrs. Ravenscroft received the guests with great cour- tesy, caressed Cassy, and told her how much her sister wished to see her. Dr. Vonberg was also making a morning call, and was excessively attentive to Baron and Lady Vancleve, for whose titles he felt profound respect. Mrs. Vandoren came into the parlour in a very few minutes, and after the most cordial greetings, asked Mr. and Mrs. Vancleve to walk up into Adele's room, as she was slightly fatigued by her ride. They had persuaded her to remain where she was, and she had commissioned her to request her father and mother to come to her. Mrs. Vandoren taking little Gassy in her arms, led the way to Adele's chamber. They were struck with the perfect air of comfort the room presented, and delighted with the great improvement in Adele. Her father had not seen her since she left home; the sisters were overjoyed to meet again; Cassy laughed and danced with delight.   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     181 "Well, daughter," asked the Baron, at the close of an hour's visit, "do you feel like wending your way homeward?" "A few days longer," interceded Mrs. Vandoren; we cannot, indeed, spare her yet. Might she not remain until Cassy resumes her studies next week?" "Say yes, Baron Vancleve," urged Cassy, coaxing y; " we are taking such good care of her, and uncle Eldrid and Adele have an unfinished game of chess too." "I can see plainly she will be very happy to be left, Miss Cassy, and am afraid I shall yield if her mother do not veto." "I shall love to pass a few days more with our kind friends, mother, if you do not greatly prefer my re- turning with you. I feel, certainly, much revived by the change of scene. I am so glad you brought my darling Cassy with you; I really pined to look uon her sweet face." "Are you not coming home with us, sister?--bro- ther says he has some trouble to keep me from miss- ing you." "No, little dear," said her mother, as Adele was about to answer, "sister is looking so well, and Miss Cassy and Miss Elsie are so kind in their entreaties that she may stay, you must come with us some other day to bring her home." This satisfied the little girl, and she kissed her sister "good-by," resting upon her promise not to stay behind the next time she came for her. 16*'     182     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "Not brought Adele!" cried Ernest, as he lifted Cassy from the carriage, and walked into the house with his mother and father-" is she sick?" "Have not seen her as well for months," replied the Baron; " it seems incredible four days could have wrought such a change." "Perhaps," observed Lady Vancleve, "that very skilful physician, Baden, has been prescribing for her." "Not he; I will answer for that, mother, without father's sanction, neither would Mr. Ravenscroft have permitted it." "Why dear, Doctor Bryant would not hesitate if he thought he could do good," replied his mother. The peculiar rise of the brow of Ernest, and ex- pression of his countenance, much amused his father, and he replied, "I question if our good Doctor is always actuated by benevolence, Henriette; that may be measured by the financial condition of the patient. I have understood his interference has sometimes been rebuked by a refusal to defray the bill, and we can attest to the no small amount of his annual mes- senger; however, the Doctor is a very pleasant man, and we must not take cognizance of his charges, he has not near so large a practice as Baden, and cannot afford, as he does, to attend to the peasantry gratui- tously." "Very likely," said Ernest, 4"his son Lewellyn in- tends practising medicine, he has more brains than his father, and far more liberality; meanness among K   HEIGHTS OP EIDELBERG.     183 College boys is never tolerated, and he is entirely free from it." "I like him much," returned his mother, "the day after the sail, Bertrand came over for some addi- tions to Adele's wardrobe, when I proposed returning with him. You were not here Ernest, and at the land. ing, Lewellyn and Nicholas Schmidt insisted on es- corting me over the river; they might be held in con- trast. Lewellyn Bryant called my attention con- stantly to something beautiful in nature; his practised eye did not miss the most minute object worth seeing: but what most attracted me, was the serious, and very eloquent manner in which he alluded to the great Creator of all these wonders; how much man was indebted to a first Cause, for just the beauties afforded to the sight. He spoke of the littleness of man, of his thanklessness in beholding, without remembering to whom he was so much a debtor. I listened to him with delight, and made an effort to draw out the sen. timents of the other, but Nicholas was trifling, and insipid, though extremely polite; they declined going into the house, but when I left Mr. Ravenscroft's, they were both waiting with Bertrand, whom they would not allow to come back with me, as they intend- ed rowing "Lady Vancleve" over themselves, which Lewellyn did. His mind took another vein, returning;. he was comparing different countries, and I was not a little diverted to mark how all others sank in his estimation before Germany; he will make a great man, mark my words."     184     nEIGHTs o0 EIDELBERG. "Lewellyn always commends himself," Ernest re- marked with a bright smile. "CHis manner is exceedingly winning. I wonder he visits here so seldom, Ernest." "We meet every day at school, and our lessons keep us pretty much engaged at our respective homes, mother." Is that the sole reason my son," asked his father, regarding him attentively. "Of course, father, as the residence of Professor Weiss, I would avoid the house of Dr. yrant, and Lewellyn would not be satisfied with one-side visits." "Is Lewellyn ignorant of the cause of your having so little social intercourse, my son? "He is not sir," said Ernest, dropping his eyes, and turning a little toy of his sister's nervously be- tween his fingers. Lady Vancleve took Cassy's hand and led her from the room. tErnest," continued his father, with the same se- riousness, "however your own mind may be tinctured by Protestantism, do not, I pray you, add to the dis- tress of your parents, by endeavouring to spread your heresy into other now peaceful, happy families." Ernest was silent. "Father Basil is fearful of your influence; it would be felt, if put forth. Must I command, or is my request sufficient, Ernest?"The Baron was standing, with folded arms, his shoulder resting against the mantel; Ernest was sitting on a low chair, immediately before the fire. As his father paused, he slowly arose, and   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      185 deliberately laid the toy upon the mantel. Ernest, your promise." Ernest shook his head. "Ernest, is authority to be enforced? Is not the desire of your father to be gratified?" The cheek of the son grew pale, as the father's became flushed. In a low, solemn voice, Ernest at length spoke: "The progress of the gospel might flow on without human aid; but it has pleased God to choose man as his instrument. Father, a dispensation of that gospel is laid upon me; and woe is me, if I preach not that gospel. You may silence my lips by pardntal author- ity; but neither commands, nor entreaties, father, can: check the unconquerable desire of my heart, to pro- claim the truth." The entrance of the servants with dinner, closed their lips. Lady Vancleve, with Cassy, came into the room at the same time. "I will see you in the library at five o'clock, Ernest," said the Baron. Ernest bowed. The child was the only one who felt unrestrained. She descanted volubly on the de- lights of her visit. "What did sister say about coming home, Cassy?" asked Ernest, as he steadied the glass she was endea- vouring to hold, with one of her hands full. She gave. him a bright look over the top of it; and when he. replaced it on the table, she replied, eagerly: "O, sister doesn't want to come home at all, but     186     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. she wants to see you; she says so, brother. When will you go? Will you take me with you?" "I would like to, dear." "Shall brother, mamma?" Her mother smiled, but shook her head. "I loved Miss Elsie," she continued, quite satisfied with the dissent. "She gave me these pictures; I will draw them this evening. Shall I, brother?" "To be sure, dear, if you wish to." "She asked mamma to leave me there till sister came home, but I said 'No, no, Miss Alice, brother can't do without me.'" "And how would Cassy do without her brother?" inquired her mother. The big tears filled her eyes, and turning quickly to him, she said, eagerly, "You will not leave me, will you, Ernest?" "Not willingly, my sweet little sister, but see here what I have got for you." He unrolled a little box containing a very nice lead pencil; she soon forgot all her sorrow in the beauty of her brother's gift, and was all life and gladness again. "Mrs. Vandoren says the resemblance of our Cassy to her Cassy, Dien her age, is very striking," observed Lady Vancleve. "There is a similarity even now," said Ernest, regarding his little sister very attentively, "yet I think it is more in voice and countenance, than fea- ture." I suppose Stephen Hengis was under the im- pression Cassy Vandoren was the sister of Carl when   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBE MR.     187 he remarked, 'That little girl looks as if she belonged to Ravenscroft rather than you Vancleve, she is so like his sister.' At the time I thought he meant she resembled Carl, and replied, there could scarcely exist a stronger contrast. I recollect perfectly his answer, 'Iow strangely, differently people view th same object.'" "They are alike, though I never noticed it before," said his father. eWhat sort of lecture had you?" asked Lady Van- cleve. "The Doctor did not succeed in entertaining me, mothrr; I was so annoyed at my reception, I was not a fai judge of its merits." "What annoyed you?" inquired the Baron, with seeming carelessness. "You will perhaps think it hardly worth the re. peating, father, but there was a reserve seat for me with the Professor's family. I declined, but was-told by our Janitor 'it was Dr. Vance's order,' and so forced to sit there amidst the winks and blinks of the Collegiates. Hess Wintersteen was particularly amused; nothing is ever lost on him." "What martyrdom!" said his mother, laughing. "What else, dear?" Ernest would not laugh. "Well, after lecture, the Doctor asked me very courteously, if I would see Mrs. Vance and his daugh. ter home; Dr. Bryant had offered his carriage, and he (Dr. Vance) had another engagement; of ourse     188    HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. I could not refuse, but why Iam singled out among so many of Miss Meta's friends I cannot conceive." "Worse than martyrdom!" exclaimed his mother, "to be compelled to sit by an admired beauty, to be the envy of a bevy of beaux, to be obliged to ride through a delightful country in a very comfortable coach, in the society of two very elegant ladies-my unfortunate son! Now, to recruit yourself, fulfil a promise I made to Cassy, that you would show her the black colt after dinner, and you will have time to make Adele a visit before the hour your father re- quires you." "It will be far more to my taste than my morning's performances, though you laugh at me, mother." Cassy resigned her pencil and pictures into her mother's safe-keeping, and went off with Ernest in high spirits. "Ernest has avowed himself a decided Protestant, Henriette," said the Baron, when they were alone, "and we might as easily check Blitzen Wasser Cas- cade as arrest its progress; he is thoroughly imbued with the poison, and will yet be a leader among the heretics." "What was the result of your interview with Father Basil?" asked Lady Vancleve. The Baron 3hw a long breath, turned his back towards the fire, but said nothing. !"Ernest is all we could desire he should be," con- tinued the lady, "and improves intellectually, daily; how could he be altered for the better? I sincerely   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     189 wish he would see, as we see; but, Lorenzo, I confess I do not feel that intense anxiety I did once, and may it not be advisable to let him alone Listen to him now-he is calling Michael's two boys to go with him and Cassy to the cattle inclosure; he never passes by an opportunity of giving pleasure." The -Baron smiled sadly, and said, "His heart and principles are faultless in our view, Henriette-but his eternal destiny! -" "He is to meet you at five o'clock; what plan do you mean to pursue?-was any suggested by Father Basil? "Yes; that of forming an alliance, if possible, between our family and that of Dr. Vance." "The commencement was rather unfortunate, and I doubt if such a scheme will prosper," observed Lady Vancleve. The Baron smiled, but made no reply. "Depend upon it, Lorenzo, all stratagem will fail with Ernest; he must be dealt with frankly and openly." "Icannot tolerate the system of deception either; but Dr. Weiss feels so confident he will be restored from his apostasy by this connection, I consented to make no opposition to any manoeuvres he and Dr. Vance may judge necessary; we, Henriette, are to remain neutral." "Very certainly I shall be neutral-I should be sorry to be otherwise," said Lady Vancieve, scorn- 1'?     190     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. fully. "Husband, how can you permit him to be so grossly imposed upon?" ' The means will surely be sanctified, my dear Hen- riette, if our beloved boy's salvation is secured by an alliance with this family, so truly devoted to our 'Blessed Lady.' Dr. Weiss and Dr. Vance are ex- ceedingly alarmed. They tell me this heresy is creep- ing through the College, and both agree that if by any means their plan can be accomplished, the resto- ration of Ernest to the true Church will stay the pro- gress of this heresy in the school; his influence is unbounded there." "May not his influence as a Protestant be felt in the family of Dr. Vance, and thus render abortive all his schemes, and introduce misery and discord in the vain hope of establishing the Catholic faith in our own? "I hinted such a sequence to Basil, but he assured me there would be no hazard of that kind in forming the connection. Miss Vance is so well fortified she would be able to repel a whole army of heretics." "Is her armour transferable?" asked Lady Van- cleve, with a sneer. "Henriette," returned the Baron, a little bitterly, "she is so entirely convinced of the infallibility of her beloved Church, that she is invulnerable to every shaft; I know of no other plan of recovering our wanderer." There was heart-sadness in the sudden fold of those hands, as Lady Vancleve sat silently, steadily gazing into the fire.   HEIGHTS OFP IDELBERG.     191 The Baron, with folded arms, walked the floor; he did not resume the subject. The merry voice of Cassy, asking for '"mamma," and her light bound into the room, dispelled for the time all melancholy feeling.' It has been said with truth by the poet, "A babe in a house is a well- spring of pleasure," and there was in this little child a power to subdue or charm away " evil spirits;" her innocence, her happy laugh, her guileless affection, was so winning, and her playfulness so contagious, that no matter what the mood of her companion little Cassy-was sure to excite mirth, and they would be engaged in some innocent romp before they were aware. "There," she exclaimed, springing towards the door, "I told Ernest to whistle 'The Rose of Baden- burg' for me to know when he was coming." The door was opened for her, and gliding like a fairy through the hall, in a few minutes she returned on her brother's shoulder, 'calling to her father "that Ernest said she had mounted a new 'coat of arms."' Adele, he said, was still improving and very bright. "Was Dr. Vonberg there, Ernest " inquired his mother. "he was, mamma, but in the parlour with Mrs. Ravenscroft; I was with the other members of the family in the study." "Hle has been quite attentive there since the even- ing of Carl's incident upon the Niese."     192     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "Carl has never named him to me. Wintersteen reports the President particularly attentive to one of the widow ladies, but Hess has to assent himself to the title the fellows have given him of 'Circulating Intelligencer;' he is always on the qui vive for gossip, and has such an amusing manner of retailing his news, he generally finds an audience." "What a contemptible character, Ernest." "He is not much respected, mother; his good temper is his redeeming quality. But you know a College is composed of a great variety; ours is as select as most schools." The hour hand pointed to five o'clock; Mrs. Van- cleve excused herself to prepare for evening visitors. "Well, my son," said the Baron, seating himself by the side of Ernest on the sofa, " am I to under- stand from your language this morning, that when your collegiate course is finished, you propose to enter the Protestant ministry?" "Such would be the strong desire of my heart and soul, dear father-but never without your sanction will I enter a pulpit; preach the gospel I must, but probably it will only be by private precept, and, I trust, by my example. My precious father, why does the Church deny her children the comfort of the knowledge of the Holy Scriptures?" "My son asks a question his father dare not. The wisdom of our holy Church is not to be ques- tioned, not to be doubted, Ernest-it would be a   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     193 mortal sin even to inquire; our clergy will direct us unto all truth." Ernest laid his forehead upon his father's hand, which he held in his, but he did not reply. Baron Vancleve continued: "I have not a wrathful feeling towards you, my son; in this apostasy you have crushed m       .        Chu crushed mly fondest hopes; in deserting the Church you draw upon yourself her terrible anathemas. I would willingly, gladly ask my bread from door to door--gladly lay down my life to reclaim you; but no sacrifice of mine would avail." "I could better bear harshness, father; your sor- row, with your gentleness, almost breaks my heart, and yet I cannot but feel that I am right. In the light of eternity I see clearly my path., Father, let one year try my sentiments; if the change is of God it will be permanent; if it should prove the infatuation you believe it to be surely, father, in that period it might be tested." The Baronhesitated. "In that time it may please our Blessed Lady to listen to our prayers for your restoration, my son, if we adopt the proper means also." All would fail; my principles could not be changed by any means human imaginings can sug- gest. I leave myself and all my difficulties on the arm of Sovereign Power--I trust in God. Ian add nothing more, father." "During that year, my son, what religious services would you propose to attend?" 17*     194     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERGB "Until of age, father, I am under your jurisdic- tion; it remains with you to decide." "You have asked one year--that year is your own, Ernest; I shall not thwart your will during that period." "Will you consider it taking undue advantage of your clemency, father, if I exchange the services of a church which can no longer benefit me, for one which now has all my sympathies." "That movement I had anticipated, Ernest; your actions are your own; for one year we will avoid all allusion to this discordant subject." "For one year, dear father," said Ernest, laying his arm affectionately over his father's shoulder. "I am far from  hopeless, my son; I trust the power of our Blessed Lady will be exerted to recall her wayward child." The tea-bell rang very opportunely; Ernest would have been at loss for a reply to this observation; he only said, "I did not think it was so late; I must finish my address this night, if I sit up the whole of it." "t Your mother expects the family of Dr. Vance to pass the evening with her; she will be greatly disap- pointed to miss you from her circle." His mother thought his reason satisfactory, readily excused him, and said she would proffer his "regrets to the ladies." "Apology, not regrets," said Ernest laughing, at the same time lifting Cassy over the back of her   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     195 chair, and placing her on his shoulder, "come my left- hand aid," he said playfully, " you and I have an even. ing's work before us." Cassy wrapped her arm around his head, as he marched off whistling an air. "Your heart is bound up in that baby Ernest," observed his father, "what a queer conceit it is to have her always at your elbow when you study, is it credible she never disturbs you?" "Not in the least, I sometimes almost forget she is by my side; she would be content to sit half the night I believe, with an occasional kiss or smile to break the tedium-what are you to do this evening, diamond?" "Draw Miss Elsie's pictures with my new pencil, and dress my dolly in her night-clothes." "You see, father, she is not far behind me in her evening arrangements; but we shall lose our play- time if we do not get to work soon-leave your com- pliments for the ladies, Gassy."  Bertha carried in her chair, and -the thoughts of the two were soon lost in their different employments. After a while the attention of Ernest was drawn from his composition, by some little fingers gently creeping over the cuff of his coat, he looked around inquir- ingly.  "My new pencil has breaked, brother," she whis- pered. He took the disabled article from her, and great was her astonishment to see him produce a beautiful point by twisting a little screw at the top. "Next time     my little sister will say 'has broken,' not ' breaked,'  he whispered in return with a very bright smile, "and you bear on too hard," he added. "I will draw softlyer," she replied, taking the pen- cil again in her little dimpled fingers. "More softly, dear." "More softly," she echoed still in a whisper, draw- ing a line over her paper as her brother resumed his  pen. Ernest became so absorbed he did not notice a slight touch upon his arm once again, it was not repeated until she saw him turn from his writing to. adjust some papers, he was attracted by her eager gaze. "My new pencil has broken again brother, and I did draw more softly." ' Why, Gassy, you have done nothing towards the leaf, have you been asleep?" "No, it broke very soon, and you were too busy to mend it brother, so I watched you writing." "I am very sorry dear, I did not see it, but I will put away all my things and play match-pictures with you now, until Bertha comes." This was a game Cassy delighted in, and she clapped her hands as the brightly painted pieces of flowers, houses, trees, and people fell from the box upon the table. Ernest very patiently taught her to arrange them properly; in- deed, all these evenings spent with her brother, told on her after years, neither did he consider them un- profitable to himself; he saw in Cassy a grasping in- tellect, and he felt amply repaid in the pleasure of   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERGO     197 watching the expansion of her mind, under his own tuition. She always left him cheerfully when her nurse came for her, unless it happened to be before "play time," as she called it. By eleven o'clock his salutatory was finished. The first thought of Ernest on awaking next morning was, I am free to speak, to think, to act, I am my own master. Days passed away without any reference to the vexations theme and he almost hoped it would never be revived.  To Ernest there was a pleasant monotony in his life, his daily sail far up the Niesewas a favourite amusement; he was usually alone, and the solitariness )f the place afforded him the opportunity he loved, to ontemplate the past, and form future plans; he also njoyed the chat of. the lads of both Colleges as they very day clustered among the rocks. Sometimes he net congenial spirits, frequently not; yet he felt it ras a relaxation after the morning's confinement in chool. On one occasion a knot of the students from e Catholic College had grouped on a rock near [ichael's Lodge. "There is Mike Maloney hard at ork, observed Leopold Extien, "and his wife [ally is as nice a little woman as our peasantry can ast; neither of them think it any trouble to warm fellows in skating season; that cabin of their's is al comfortable." "I have often pondered how a 'son of Erin' should ve been planted on our shores," said Rufus Has. g    er." "And never asked?" interrupted Hess Winter-     198     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. steen. "I heard the why and the wherefore, when I had only been here three days; Vancleve told me himself. The Baron was travelling with his wife and daughter, for the latter's health, through the Conti- nent and over to Britain; at a hotel, serving as waiter, was Michael Malony. Michael became enamoured with the young lady's nurse, and the young lady's nurse did not turn her back upon Mike,. but Lady Vancleve had no notion to leave the nurse behind, and the nurse had no notion to be left behind, so Michael Malony pulled up stakes and followed them home; and Baron Vancleve finding Michael could handle a spade and hold a rein, and withal a very worthy fel- low, consented that Mally, the nurse, might be Mis- tress Malony. Now sometimes- Michael talks of taking his 'bride' and the 'childer' to the 'auld country,' but the 'bride' always talks about some- thing else." "Well, I might have lived in Eidelberg half a century without discovering an Irishman was any rarity here," observed John Steuben. "Humph!" whispered Wintersteen, "here is Bry- ant's carriage, with Dr. Vance, his wife, and daugh- ter." "The old Doctor lends them his coach very often," observed Extien, ' I wonder if they are related." "No," laughed Hess, "I'll bet they hire it spare hours; think Vance could pay, boys?" "It took you to think that, Hess," said another;   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     199 "but, hush, Vancleve is coming down the river in his boat." " Vancleve,' Hess began, " the beautiful Miss Meta has just gone up to see you, I mean your sister; her father and mother are with her in Bryant's carriage, do they hire or borrow?" "I have not had the curiosity to inquire," was the reply. " The Professor peered out of the window consider- ably, looking for you among us, likely; if you hurry you will get the visit still-rush, Vancleve." Ernest sat down. "Guess you wont throw sand in our eyes, you know- you would pull our hair out by the roots, if we dared dispute your claim to the beauty's attentions-- I mean heart." "It is well you have been advised of the fact, it will at least serve to keep you in check, Hess, your informant seems to have taken no small license." "My own eyes, and my own ears are the culpable agents--dispute them, Ernest," and he laughed  mer- rily. "And your tongue undeniably keeps pace with both," replied Ernest, quite nettled, yet provoked at the feeling. "Look, there is Brock, the land-agent's wife,' en- tirely unmoved by the sneer of Ernest; -   she is trying- to draw that coach up the hills; she classes herself among the gentry, since her husband got the situation. He has three agencies, at six hundred rix thalers     200     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERO. each per annum, and she spends every cent of it, you know about her, Phonse." Young Hassinger, the lad appealed to, was intent on arranging a bird-box among the vines; when thus addressed, without turning his head he asked, "Who?" "Why Stellwagon, the blacksmith's daughter." "Well, what of her?-some of Hess's yarns." "Why, she spends every cent of Brock's income, and holds up her head above all her neighbours. Brock is the man, Phonse, your father forbid our caning, when he seized widow Hallett's baby's cra- dle, among other things, for rent she could not pay. Some of the fellows made up a sum, and sent her a better one." O, true," exclaimed Hassinger, casting a piece of vine over the nest, and coming round towards the others, "what has become of Mrs. Hallett, is she still Brock's tenant?" "Yes, but the medical students made an agree- ment to pay her rent quarterly, on condition Brock should absent himself from the cottage." "Whew!" whistled Hess, "that is a version or a perversion. Yes, the medical students did make up that quarter of the cradle memory, but ever since that, Gus Weber has made himself responsible, and threatened a vacant house on his hands, if he ever offered to ask the widow for it." "Well done, Weber," said Ernest; "he is very apt to stand between the injured and the oppressor.   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     201 "That is a man I cannot get near, somehow," observed Hess. "I dare say he has forgotten me, for he never seems to see me. When he was at College, he offered me the choice of a thrashing, or to hold my tongue; I never hear his name without thinking of a switch." "It is well something may be found to have a salu- tary effect upon the channel of your thoughts, Hess; it is marvellous how you get so much matter for your day-book. I wonder if you have heard the bridge is to be begun next Monday, October Ist?" "You are surely funning, Leopold. How did Schil- ler get the wherewith so soon?"He closed his knife, with which he had been clipping a stick, and placing it in his vest pocket, he stood straight up before Extien, in astonishment. There was a general laugh, as he slowly sat down again, asking, "How on earth was the money raised?" "Why, you were one of the largest contributors yourself," said Ernest. "No; Ravenscrofts and your folks took the lead. I gave Schiller all I had in my pocket; I don't know now the sum." "At any rate, from all the Collets, and from among the hills, there is more than sufficient to build a sub- stantial stone bridge." "There goes Ravenscroft, sailing towards the upper landing; how much he looks like an eagle. I always- get behind Carl, when I ask him a question; the light of his eyes blinds mine. The others I have never 18     202     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. spoken to; when we get the bridge, I will make their acquaintance. Boats are a troublesome medium. I think the manse might be called the 'Eagle's Nest.' The Dominie, his sister, Mrs. Vandoren, and that little M]iss Elsie, are exactly alike, and precisely like Carl, the whole of them." ds Carl landed, Ernest, leaving the party on the rock walked along the shore to meet him. "What is the reason Schiller is selected for the Salutatory, when Ravenscroft is considered the ablest Greek scholar in the province?" inquired Hassinger. "He is to take the Latin." "Yes; but the Greek has always been voted the far more honourable. Why is it?" "Paul is a hard student, and deserves it," said Hess. "I guess Ravenscroft might have had either. Schiller is the son of a widow, and Carl knew it would delight her more than all the eclat he would receive. He is high enough in the scale; no risk of his popu- larity." "Do you know this to be the fact, Wintersteen?" "A reasonable guess," replied the orator, with on4 of his peculiar laughs. "Their commencement come off the week before us; ours will be a sorry concern I'm thinking." "Why!" exclaimed two or three at once. "We have as good metal, I know," replied Hess "but next month will show 'the right,' and 'th might,' or my name is not Hess Wintersteen." "What do you mean?" inquired Leopold Extiei   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     203 with affected indifference. "f How came you acquainted with the private affairs of the tutors?" "I was in the class room, finishing an exercise, when the President came in with Dr. Weiss; they were in such earnest conversation that neither of them perceived me." "Did you remain, Hess?-That was too contempti- ble." "Contemptible or not, remain I did. They are eager enough after our private sayings and doings; why might not I take a similar method of acquainting myself with theirs? Well, I tell you, before com- mencement there is to be a grand investigation made. A meeting of the Trustees is to be called, and in pre- sence of the President and Professors, every student, of each class; is to take an oath that he does not pos- sess the Scriptures-or produce the book-and they are all to be burned.'" "Students or Scriptures?" inquired Leopold, with a forced laugh. "Weiss would not care niuch which, I reckon," returned Hess, with a merry peal. "I do not like the manner of getting the informa- tion; but it may be of importance to some of the fel- lows to be advised of this movement," observed Hans Wirtz. "The Bibles will be burned to no purpose, unless Vancleve is put on for a backstick," continued Hess; "for he is so full of texts, that they drop out con- stantly. I 'know some of them haunt me when I     204     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG, would as leave not; but how these became known is the mystery; some one with real evil designs, has given information; if not, they would not be afraid to appear as the expose. Vonberg said repeatedly, to- day, 'I was told;' so, whoever it may be, he went straight to headquarters to inform." "Bt Vonberg would be rather disaffected; rumour says he is turning Protestant himself," said young Wirtz. "Not a bit of him," returned Hess. "He is tho- rough; he will never change to anything else, but he may change somebody else." The boys good-humouredly laughed at this sally of wit, as they obeyed with one impulse the summons of the College bell to the afternoon session. CHAPTER VII. Wouldst thou be rich, give unto the poor; Thou shalt have thine own with usury, For the secret hand of Providence Prospereth the charitable alway." "This is a bright, lovely morning, Eldrid," said Mrs. Vandoren, just after worship. Shall we make the promised visit to Mrs. Blucher?" "I have about two hours' writing in my study, Meggy; by ten o'clock I will be at leisure." "It is now half-after seven, father. Bertrand will   HEIGHTS OP EIDELBERG.     205 harness the horse as soon as he has breakfasted. I shall have time to take the young ladies a drive be- fore you require it. Dr. Baden recommends plenty of fresh air, Miss Adele, to all his patients," con. tinued he, as he offered his arm to assist her into the parlour. "A pleasant prescription, truly," she replied, of which I shall be happy to avail myself." You must let me step in at the Bank a few mo- ments; I will not long detain you." The party soon set out in high spirits, and after a delightful ride, returned, bringing with them the money intended for Captain Blucher and his sailors. The four hundred was safely deposited with aunt Meggy, and Carl, with the remainder, proceeded to the vessel to remunerate the sailors. At the door of Captain Blucher the knock of Mr. Ravenscroft was answered by a lady, apparently about thirty. "Have we the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Blucher? he inquired. Mrs. Blucher bowed affirmatively, and with a re- finement and courtesy that rather surprised them, invited them to enter. "I am the father of Carl Ravenscroft," he said, and permit me, Mrs. Blucher, to introduce my sister, Mrs. Vandoren, to you." "To Mrs. Vandoren, or Mr. Ravenscroft, I scarcely need an introduction, she replied, extending a hand to each; by character, they are well known to me. 18*     206     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. Mr. Brock, Mr. Ravenscroft," she said, with some hesitation, turning towards a well dressed, though vulgar looking man, with an exceedingly dark counte- nance. A slight nod of the head was the only recog- nition given by the gentleman, who immediately rose to go. Mrs. Blucher turned an anxious look upor him, and excusing herself, followed him to the fron door. "You will tell Captain Blucher, ma'am," they dis tinctly heard him say, " that Mr. Brock called, and ha called for the last time. Two weeks to wait for ren is rather long for John Brock, and to-morrow hi goods will be under seizure." Mr. Ravenscroft started to his feet, and advance towards the door, but before he reached it, the froi door closed, and Mrs. Blucher again appeared. The colour had mounted to her cheek, but s1 showed no other sign of agitation. "Are your children at home?" asked Mrs. Vand ren, anxious to relieve the awkward pause. "Luther is at school; the little girls I will c down, if you would like to see them." Two little girls soon appeared, the one about fo the other six years of age, both quite pretty; 1 their dress, though perfectly neat, looked faded, though it had been a long time in wear. The fur ture wore the same aspect. The house was very sm one parlour and a kitchen back, with a narrow st of ground at the side, not worthy to be called a i den. They were evidently much straitened in   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     207 cumstances, and although Mr. Ravenscroft yearned to relieve her present embarrassment, delicacy prevented his doing so. After paying a short visit they took their leave, knowing the effort to converse must be painful to Mrs. Blucher. "To-morrow!" said Mrs. Vandoren, when they were seated in the carriage-" we have but little time to act before that wretched man comes down upon them." "I know him of old," replied Mr. Ravenscroft, " he is a cold, calculating, hard-hearted man, where he finds poverty; but he has ingratiated himself with several wealthy landholders, and is employed as their agent. Baron Vancleve places great confidence in him." "What time is it, Eldid?" "Fifteen minutes past twelve." "Then we can drive to Walsh's, and purchase the presents we need for the children; a straw carriage for the little girls will be far better than dolls, as it will amuse Luther to draw them in it, and at the same time assist Mrs. Blucher, as she appears to have the sole charge of them. There is evidently no do- mestic about the establishment. A velocipede for the little boy will be the very thing. Two plainer dresses than silk for Mrs. Blucher will be more in keeping with her present circumstances." The purchases were soon made, and by half-after one they arrived at the door of the manse. The diffi- culties of Captain Blucher were soon made known to     208     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. Carl privately. "I will relieve his mind at once," he said, much excited, and hastily putting on his coat and hat-" that such a man as Captain Blucher should be in the power of that paltry, cringing fel- low!-I always despised the very sight of him. Sub- servient to his superiors, coarsely familiar with his equals, and arrogant to the last degree with those over whom misfortune gives him some power. The very sailors of the Ariel might put him to the blush-if blush he could. The sailors and Mr. Brock Hwhy do I name them in the same day? They are a set of noble fellows, father-but I cannot wait to tell you now-just give me your riding-whip, I will drive im- mediately to the vessel, see the Captain, and dine with him on board. Let Bertrand take the presents for the children to the house." "Your arrangements are all good, my son," said Mr. Ravenscroft, laughing, "but would it not be as well, and as Christian, to be silent on Mr. Brook's good qualities?" "No doubt, father, you are right, but the thought of him banishes every good thought." "Then banish him from your memory, and be grateful that Providence has placed it in your power to free Captain Blucher from his odious bondage." A cause for thankfulness indeed, thought he, as he walked down the avenue, and took the reins from the hand of Bertrand, but I would beg it, ere he should be held his slave. Captain Blucher received his friend with a warm   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     209 pressure of the hand, but Carl saw there was a de- pression which he in vain endeavoured to hide. "I have come, Captain, to-day, to take some pork and beans with you, if you do not object." "A most welcome visitor, Carl, you cannot fail to be at all times," was the reply. I am just going to dinner, if you please, we will go below." After the meal, while still seated at the table, Carl, taking the package from his pocket, remarked, I want you to gratify me by accepting some slight me- mento of friendship, Captain Blucher. In my own mind, many things were proposed, such as chronome- ters, &c., but fearing I might purchase that with which you were already furnished, I thought it better to leave the choice to yourself, and would ask you to receive this little package from me." Captain Blucher coloured deeply. "Is it to re- munerate me for the service Providence placed it in my power to render you Carl?" "No wealth could suffice for that," was the reply, "neither would I wish to lessen the weight of obliga- tion. Do you refuse this small token of affection?" The hand of Captain Blucher was extended imme- diately. "Pardon me for appearing for a moment un- grateful for your kindness." The package was handed him. "Can I possibly accept so munificent a present," he said, his voice trembling with emotion. "I should rejoice to have you do so."     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "I will accept it," he said, taking the young man's hand in both of his; "I cannot, dare not, refuse it. God has answered my prayer-you are the means he has chosen to open a way which seemed pent up. Thank you, thank you, dear Carl, another time I may explain." Carl shook his hand affectionately, and knowing he would wish to relieve the anxiety of Mrs. Blucher, took his leave. "' Well, Carl!" said Cassy, as he entered his father's study, come and tell us the success of your mission, we have been awaiting your return most impatiently." "Was it accepted my son?" asked Mr. Ravens- croft. "Yes, father, in the kindest manner, but stern necessity only compelled him to do so." " Did he make any allusion to his present embar- rassment?" "Not exactly; he spoke of prayer being answered, &c., which would have been Hebrew to me, had I not known of his difficulties. Notwithstanding them all, the acceptance evidently cost him a struggle. He has a proud spirit, that Captain Blucher." "I regret it," observed Mr. Ravenscroft, but we all have our imperfections." "I did not speak disparagingly, father." "I know it my son, and wished to point out to you how little compatible with a Christian spirit is a proud one. Even a proud look the Lord hateth, how must he then view a proud spirit."   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.           211 "I stand corrected father, an independent one, I should have said. It was evinced so often on the passage. He would be much happier in bestowing a favour, than in being the recipient. I am sure that he would fully accord with the Scriptures, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'" "Poor fellow, the pleasure must be altogether un- known to him with his present salary." "You are mistaken, father; it was relieving the wants of a friend in prison that has brought him into all this difficulty. We brought Captain Horn home, as passenger, but I never knew his history until this morning. I met him upon the wharf, looking for a situation. He told me his chief anxiety was to liqui- date his debt to Captain Blucher, who could ill afford to lose by him. I, of course, asked no questions, but he went on to say, that two days after he arrived at Coburg Cove, he became ill, and for six weeks was conscious of nothing. " When I came to my senses," he continued, "I found myself stripped of every- thing, my watch and purse stolen, and every article of value gone. My landlord presented bills to the amount of one hundred and fifty rix thalers, which, of course, I was unable to pay. Thrown into a damp prison, in my weak state, I should soon have died, had not Captain Blucher obtained my release by pay- ing the sum for me." "This accounts for his present difficulties," said Mr. Ravenscroft, "occasioned by his own generosity. I am too happy we were able so soon to extricate him     212     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. from them. Such a man ought not to remain in obscurity. I wonder what his talents are as a sea- man." "Of the first order; the most experienced captains in the port come to him for information. He once gave lessons on navigation, and, it is said, turned out some fine scholars. I heard an old captain say, that if the worth of Captain Blucher were only known, he would soon command one of our largest vessels." "Then I will at once see Baron Vancleve. His friend Hassinger owns the Africanus; they are look- ing for a captain, and are quite at a loss as to the choice."' "Suppose I cross this afternoon, father, see the Baron, and tell him all that I know of his character. To-morrow may be too late." "What time is it now Carl?" "Just four o'clock." "I will accompany you; it is an important point to settle. As I feel rather fatigued, I will ride to the landing. Ask Bertrand to prepare the carriage." Baron Vancleve, surprised at seeing Mr. Ravens- scoft at this unusual hour, came hastily to the landing to meet him. "You have no ill news, I trust, sir." "None whatever; we have the best tidings to bring of your daughter; but I came on business of a very important nature. I wished to interest you for Captain Blucher. The Africanus, I understand, is still without a commander."   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     213 "I have made many inquiries relative to Captain Blucher," replied the Baron, "and find he is a young man of excellent parts, a good seaman, and with high moral principle. I have recommended him to Has- singer & Brothers as a fit person to take command of the Africanus." "The very business we came upon, and we are truly happy to find it in such good hands." "But you will return with me to the house, and see Mrs. Vancleve for a few moments?" "Not to-night, thank you, there is some fear al- ready that darkness will overtake us. With many thanks, Baron Vancleve, we leave you." The friendly grasp of the hand showed that the Baron had forgotten, at least for the present, the alienation of feeling in consequence of religious opinions. "Carl," said Elsie, when they were gathered round the parlour table in the evening, "you have not yet told us about your sailors." "Well, Elsie, I have only to say that the money, instead of being safely lodged in their pockets, is still in my own. To a man, they withstood me. There seems something in the very atmosphere of that ves- sel that forbids all approach to covetousness. Mr. Graef, the mate, assured me, with a politeness worthy of a courtier, that the pleasure of my society had far more than repaid him for all his trouble, and 'I hope, Mr. Ravenscroft,' he added, laughing, 'does not wish to bring me more deeply into his debt."' 19     214     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "'Nor I,' said Peter Hawse, 'wont have none of Master Carl's money-not I. Han't all the Bible readins, and all your kindness to a poor man to go to no account? No! no! for as it stands, I'm the obleeged, after all.' "'Nor I,' nor I,' said his two comrades, raising their hats, and whirling them into the air, 'hurrah for master Carl! Hurrah! hurrah! long life and many good days to him-hurrah! hurrah!' "Shaking hands heartily with them, I was glad to make my escape from the noisy demonstrations of their affection. Now, there must be another consulta- tion as to the best method of rewarding them. Aunt Meggy, what is your advice?" "Suppose you defer it until Christmas, Carl, and then buy them each a new suit of clothes, and their wives, if they have any, a new gown." (4A good thought, Aunt Meggy. It will be the very thing." The entrance of Adele put a stop to the conversa- tion; and music was soon proposed, which beguiled the evening pleasantly. We will now follow Captain Blucher to his home. It was about five o'clock when he reached there. His wife met him at the door, and endeavoured to hide her agitation. Putting his arm around her, they walked into the parlour together. "Why are your eyes so red with weeping, Marguerite; have you been troubled with your daily visitor?" "Yes, yes! Alfred, he has been here; we shall be   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     215 beggared-turned out of house and home. He gives us no longer than to-morrow." "And that will be quite long enough. Compose yourself, dear Marguerite; I am now, thanks to Him who has always provided for us, far out of the reach of his sordid grasp." "And are we relieved, dear Alfred?" she said, bursting into a flood of tears-- By what means? 0 tell me, tell me!" "Here is a sum," said he, handing the package to his wife, "that will set all straight." "What is in it?" "Gold coin, to the amount of four hundred rix thalers, a present from Carl Ravenscroft. Under other circumstances, I would not have accepted it, as it was not my just due; but as it is, I consider it as coming from the hand of the Lord." The package was opened by Mrs. Blucher, each piece taken out, counted, and recounted, and then placed in piles before her on the table. With her whole mind absorbed by them, she did not observe her husband's amused and delighted look at her ecstacy, until, tapping her on the shoulder, he said, playfully, "Not worshipping the mammon, Margue- rite?" A beaming smile was the only answer. "You evidently do not regret my accepting it," he said, kissing her cheek affectionately. "Declining would have been act of madness, Al-     216     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. fred, and fostering your natural pride; that would not have been pleasing to your Maker." "It was given as though a favour were granted to him, in the acceptance. Just like Carl, he has a way of his own, unlike all others." "Dear young man, may the richest blessings rest upon him. We can lie down and sleep to-night--a comfort we have not enjoyed for a fortnight." "In the morning, I quite enjoy the thought of the old man's visit." "Take care of pride again, Alfred." The sleep which Mrs. Blucher anticipated for that night was not obtained, neither was it courted; for the morning dawned upon them  ere they ceased speaking of the unexpected relief afforded them. "It is seven o'clock, Alfred. I was a false prophet last night; but our wakefulness was from so different a cause, and I feel so much refreshed, that I doubt whether I am the same Marguerite Blucher." "Why, mamma!" said Luther, laughing, "have you been swopped in the night?" "I do not know, Luther; on that point I should hardly be a competent witness." A loud knock at the door arrested their attention. "An early visitor," remarked Captain Blucher; "run down, Luther, and open the door." The child returned, looking pale and frightened "Mr. Brock, father, and another man with' him. I wonder what he is going to do?"   HEIGHTS OP EIDELBERG.      217 "No harm to us, my little son; I will just go down, and send him away. Do not fear him." The child, thus reassured, followed his father again ,down stairs, keeping, however, very closely by his side. 4"Good-morning, Captain, good-morning i" said Mr. Brock, as Captain Blucher entered. "We have come on very unpleasant business, sir, very; I am sorry, but stern necessity compels. Proceed to business, iMr. Hahn. This table," continued he, (pointing to a small mahogany one, that once belonged to the mother of Mrs. Blucher, and possessed great intrinsic value,) "as furniture goes, is worth about a dollar; but I don't want to take the advantage of any one, and as my wife wants something of the kind, I will give one dollar and fifty cents. So, just put that in my car- riage, Hahn, before we begin with the valuation of the other articles." Captain Blucher stood with folded arms, waiting calmly to the end of the harangue, then, in a low voice, asked, "Have you now finished Mr. Brock, all you have to say upon the subject?" "Why! I think Captain," he replied, turning round contemptuously, you speak more as a creditor than debtor. Haughty airs don't become men in debt, I assure you. When I see men so proud, I lose all pity for them." "You must, indeed, have a proud set of debtors, if we are to judge by your humanity. Relative to the table, Mr. Hahn, I countermand that order." 19*     218     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. Mr. Hahn stood irresolute, with the end of the table raised on his hand ready to be conveyed to his shoulder, but the calm, determined manner of Cap. tain Blucher produced a feeling of respect he could not overcome. "I am most happy, Mr. Brock," he continued, to relieve your sorrow in the execution of this stern necessity. Your rent, for the last six months is one hundred rix thalers. There it is. I have written the receipt. Sign the paper, and do not render it necessary for me to show you the front door. At the end of the next quarter, place a bill upon your house, as I shall vacate it at that time." "Why what would you have, Captain Blucher? Must people pay taxes, and give their houses away to their tenants? Last quarter my rent was not paid me punctually." "We were only three days out of time, then you made six calls upon us for it." "Well! I can tell you there is not a house in the whole village half so good for the same rent." "When I want your advice, I will ask it, until then, it may as well be withholden." "Perhaps," replied Mr. Brock with a sneer, the house on Elfin Heights would suit you. That is va- cant, Mr. Bremer has gone to England. As Baron Vancleve's agent, I have the renting of it, as it belongs to his estate. Would you like to have the refusal? You would find Baron and Lady Vancleve pleasant and near neighbours." Captain Blucher's brow darkened at this last sally,   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     219 but a look of supreme contempt was the only reply. The money had been placed upon the table, and he waited in perfect silence'Mr. Brock's signature. The latter in vain endeavoured to hide his confusion by low bravado. "I hope Captain Blucher," said Mr. Hahn, "-you won't blame me, sir; you know I was only in the line of my duty." C"Certainly not, Mr. Hahn." The receipt was folded and  handed to Captain Blucher. Mr. Brock attempted to speak, but a stern "Our business is now concluded, sir. Until the 25th of next December never enter this door, then you may have your rent and key together. Good morning gentlemen."  Mr. Brock, without returning the salute, walked hastily out, leaving Mr. Hahn to follow and close the door after him. "Come   papa,' said M rs. Blucher, entering the room as their visitors left it, "here Kate and Maggie have  been dressed this long time, waiting for your morning kiss, and are quite impatient at the deten- tion."  The kiss was soon bestowed on the now-hap- py children, and one placed on each knee until they were all summoned to breakfast. "I never thought to own a velocipede, said Luther yesterday I  could hardly study my lessons, it was so much in all m y thoughts."     220     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "And such a splendid carriage, Luther!-did you ever see such a beauty!" "I am delighted to see you so happy, my little dar- lings; but you know it is mamma's rule, that you must be quite quiet at breakfast time. It is not pretty to hear little children talk at table." "t What a change since yesterday," remarked Cap- tain Blucher; "then I felt as if bound with the iron chain of despotism; now, there is a freedom I can scarcely realize. I must give Carl the gratification of knowing the happiness he has imparted. It will cost my pride something, but it is his due. I will endea- vour to see him before going to the vessel." When the meal was finished, after commending his little household, at the family altar, to the care of One in whom he had long confided, he set out for the manse. Carl espied his friend from the parlour window, as he came up the avenue, and hastened out to meet him. "I was just contemplating a visit to your vessel, Captain. This is the last day I can call my own, and I wanted to see you before I returned to College." "I shall be particularly happy to see you, Carl; I came this mornirg to have some conversation with you, but will now defer it until you come down." "c But will you not come in?" "Not to day, as I have seen you; in a few days Mrs. Blucher intends accompanying me to make a visit. She is anxious to do so, and will as soon as possible. Good-by, for the present."   HEIGHTS OP EIDiLBERG.     221 "Who were you speaking to, Carl?" asked Cassy, as he again entered the parlour." Captain Blucher; I have promised him a visit on board his vessel to-day. I may as well pay it now; I shall then be at the service of the ladies the remain- der of the day." "Do so, cousin," replied Cassy; " in the meantime we will settle some important matters relative to Christmas surprises for Bertrand and Katrine." As Carl stepped on board the boat, a gentlemanly looking young man came also. "Can you tell me where Captain Blucher is to be found?" he asked. "Follow me," was the reply; we shall probably see him on board his vessel." He was standing at the other end of the schooner, and advanced to meet them. "I have a note, Captain Blucher, from Messrs. Hassinger to you," said he, "which they desired me to deliver into your own hand." "Is an answer required?" "I presume not, by me; my orders extended only to the delivery. Good-morning, gentlemen." The eye of Captain Blucher remained riveted on the note a long time after its perusal. With a coun- tenance beaming with pleasure, he at length handed it to Carl. "I verily believe that little dip I had into the water for you is to make my fortune. Read this, Carl." The note ran as follows: " At the recommendation of Baron Vancleve, Messrs. Hassinger would be glad     222     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. to see Captain Blucher in reference to the ship Africanus, for which they now require a commander. A prompt answer desired in person." "What do you think of that offer?" said he, as the note was folded and handed him again. "What do you think of it, Carl? The command of the Africanus for the master of the Ariel I Why, the best captains in the port have their eye upon it; the most splendid vessel ever launched here. I surely must be dream- ing; but I trust I may not soon arouse from such an agreeable reverie." "Had you not better see Mr. Hassinger at once? They are very precise old gentlemen, eccentric in the extreme; but if you can only keep up to their strict notions of system, you will get along admirably. They are thoroughly just and honest, but not benevo- lent, and never make allowances for any of the failings of human nature. I am well acquainted with them; if you wish, I will go with you, and introduce you." "Thank you, Carl, I will be glad to accept your offer. But do not think the old gentlemen are un- known to me by reputation, and I shall get along far better with them for this knowledge. In a moment, I will be ready for you." After walking about a mile along the wharf, Carl stopped before a nest of old stone buildings, the architecture of which was so rude, that they seemed to have been built ages since. "This is it," whispered Carl, at the same time   HEIGHTS OP EIDELBERG.      223 peeping in; '"and there is the old gentleman, large as life, at his usual post." The next moment they were standing in a large counting-room, in the centre of which was a square table, covered with what was once green baize, but age and ink had long since deprived it of its original hue. Seated beside it was the gentleman in question, poring over the contents of a newspaper. About a dozen desks, all occupied by clerks, busily engaged in writing, and a large stove, completed the furniture of the room. Mr. Hassinger's attention was so much engrossed that he was not aware of their entrance until Carl spoke. "Good morning, Mr. Hassinger." The head of the old gentleman was quickly raised and the speaker scanned closely; a pair of small, sharp black eyes peering straight through huge silver glasses. Carl advanced nearer. "I have brought my friend, Captain Blucher, sir, to see you." "Why Carl, my young friend, is it you? right glad once more to meet you; had rather a sorry time of" it; eh! Your most obedient, Captain Blucher. Be seated, gentlemen, be seated. The spectacles were. entirely removed, wiped, placed in the vest pocket, and the paper, being carefully folded, was put on a, pile with many others; the chair was then pushedt back, and after a close survey of the person in ques, tion, he asked,  What vessel have you commanded, "The schooner Ariel," was the reply.     224     HEIGHTS Or EIDELBERG. ," What! that little two-penny, now lying in the Bay?" Captain Blucher coloured--"The same, sir." ,Well! well! none the worse for springing from nothing-the best kind of men-much the best. These sprigs of quality, with their great expectations, what are they good for? Why nothing, and worse than nothing. Now, for instance, there was my master's son, Alick Vanbanerst, a clever, good-natured fellow, but spoiled by too much money-got all his father left, and what with his stud of horses, yacht, and other flummery nonsense, soon came to the end of a long purse, and left a family of two or three children, to get along as best they might. I am a self-made man myself, sir, commended myself by my industrious habits to old Philip Vanbanerst; it was the making of me; he took me by the hand; in time made me a junior partner, and you see what it's come to. But this is not the business: I have made every inquiry respecting you, and have sent for you to offer you the -ship. The wages are one hundred and fifty dollars per month; some tonnage privilege, how much- is not yet decided. Will you accept it?" "I will sir, and endeavour to do my duty." "That is enough; six months will test it, for that time the vessel is yours. When can you go on board? We must get off in ten days. Ships lying at wharves are expensive things." "In three days, I can be ready for you." "Well! well! the bargain is made. Archibald!"   HEIGHTS OF EiDELBERG.     225 A young man came forward. " Draw up the papers for Captain Blucher. They will be ready for you to- morrow young man; call for them precisely at ten o'clock, I shall be here at that hour." Before they could say good morning, he was at the other end of the room busily engaged giving some directions. "Mr. Hassinger is an estimable man," remarked Carl, as they wended their way again toward the vessel, "but his worth is contained in rather a rough casket." "Not very flattering to some of my relatives," re- plied Captain Blucher, laughing. "Your relatives! to whom do you allude?" "Mr. Vanbanerst; he was my wife's father, and a kinder-hearted, more benevolent man never lived. His father left him a handsome estate, and his living was. in accordance with it; that did not injure him, butl he was ruined by giving his note for a large amount to a friend in whom he entirely confided." "And why did you not claim relationship, and turn champion." hIt would have made a bad impression; beside, he might have discovered that I was not entirely 'self- made, a sin he would never have forgiven. Wealthy parentage, and a collegiate course would, in his view, be worse than unfortunate. I was seventeen at the time of the change in the circumstances of my father. I had always been intended for one of the professions, but having a partiality for a sailor's life, my father, no longer having it in his power to support me, ac-- quiesced reluctantly in my wishes." 20     226     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "Mr. Hassinger would certainly have more interest in you, as the grandson-in-law of his old master, the maker of his fortune." "No, no, Mr. Hassinger is a strange man; let him make his own discoveries. I'll please him, because I know him much better than he supposes. He is an industrious, plodding man, without an idea beyond a guinea. On points with which he is not acquainted, stand your ground with him, show an independent spirit, and your fortune is made. Did you not observe that there were no thanks on my part?" I did, and a little wondered." "It would not do. Give him the value of the money he pays you, and that is all he asks. He wants no thanks, because the little courtesies of life have no charms for him; and as he cannot increase his income by them, they are worthless in his sight. If the truth must be told, Carl, he has a narrow spirit, of which you know nothing, and could scarcely ima- gine. But I must now leave you. You will excuse my returning to the vessel with you, as I want to see my present owner, to recommend Captain Horn as the commander of the Ariel; my influence with Mr. Ghent will readily obtain it for him, and there is no time to lose. He will also take the house which I at present occupy, as I can now afford to rent one more commo- dious and comfortable." Bidding his friend good-bye, Carl returned to his own home.

"AN express has been handed me by Michael; Nicho- las and the boys have arrived, and will dine with us to-day. This, too, I have received." As Baron Van- cleve spoke, he placed a folded paper in the hand of his wife; it was a notice, calling a special meeting of the Board of Trustees at the College that morning, to investigate a matter of considerable moment. Lady Vancleve made no remark upon it. She asked, "Does Father Loduvic- accompany my bro- ther?" "No, his note merely stfes his intention of remain- ing with Kate until after the commencement, to hear Ernest's speech, and leave the boys under our charge for six months. But why are you so sad to-day, Hen- riette? you are looking very pale. Are you ill?" he inquired, anxiously. "Not physically, Lorenzo," she replied; "but the misfortunes of our house are augmented daily. Even little Cassy is to be subjected to trials; I had supposed that baby would be exempt from suffering. How can I support this?" she added, bursting into tears. "You shall never be called to support it, my beloved Henriette. Tell me, what has occurred to occasion the supposition?"     228     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "t Our counsellor, Father Antoine, believes there is immediate necessity for a separation from her bro- ther; her very first impressions, he alleges, will be heretical." it Truly, we are an unfortunate family, Henriette; our path is very thorny. Yet I cannot see that the example of Ernest can be otherwise than beneficial to his little sister; her infantile mind cannot be bane- fully influenced by his sentiments. He evidently exerts no bias, or that cross would long ago have been put away; he constantly hears its praises, connected with the name of the giver, yet makes no remark. No, Henriette, neither you nor I will ever yield to any attempt to dissolve the attachment between Ernest and Cassy." Lady Vancleve wiped away her tears. "What if you should meet Father Antoine, and listen to his persuasive arguments, Lorenzo, how could I oppose you?" "I shall firmly adhere to my resolve, dear; I faith- fully promise you." "Forgive me, my husband," she said, falteringly, taking a silver crucifix from her bosom, which she wore suspended from her neck, and holding it towards him, the Baron pressed his lips reverently upon it; then kissing her pale cheek, he said, soothingly, "Be comforted, Henriette, no heavy cloud shall ever inter- cept the rays of our precious sunbeam; she and her brother shall never be separated." She saw him again raise her crucifix to his lips,   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG,      229 and she had no further dread of Dr. Ostend's influ- ence. "There," said Ernest, opening the door, and swing- ing Cassy into the room, 6"the school-bell is ringing." Then returning, he asked, "Father, at what hour does the Committee meet this morning?" "After the first session, my son; the students are all expected to be present." Ernest answered, "-Yes, sir," and disappeared. He just arrived in time to answer, as his name was called at the head of the roll. - This completed, President Vonberg arose. After requiring perfect silence, he remarked, "That as busi- ness of very solemn import was to be transacted, the recitations would be heard in the reception-room." He directed the classes "'to form in order, and remain so until the investigation, which had induced a meet- ing of the Trustees, was finished." The Professors took-their seats upon the platform, and delivered their respective lectures. These were brief, and the lessons too were hurried over; notwith- standing, the hour and the Trustees came before they were entirely finished.  Order and silence reigned; wonder held the majority mute. There was anxiety written in the quietly compressed lips of others; a few watched with unconcern the movements of the Preceptors, and among them there was an occasional whisper. At the bend of the head of President Von- berg, who had taken his official chair, Professor Ostend 20*     230     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. placed a large crucifix on a table before the platform, and then said, with great solemnity: "With the deepest concern for the everlasting welfare of the rising generation, especially forf the members of our own dear and honoured institution, we have called together the secular Board, the Presi- dent, the body of Professors, the spiritual advisers, and the whole community of students connected with St. Gabriel's College, to ascertain (if in the power of mortal man) the cause of the heretical tenets which are being insinuated among these beloved youth of our blessed Church; whether through the associa- tion with the Protestant school, or, whether some have been so far misled as to obtain, peruse, and in- troduce into this College, that proscribed volume, falsely called the Holy Scriptures. This honoured Board (he bowed gracefully to the Trustees) has ap- pointed me to require each lad, as his name is read, to take a solemn oath upon this sacred crucifix, that he does not possess a Bible, or, if he do, to place it upon this table; we reverse the roll and will com- mence with the younger classes." The division of Ernest was nearest the platform- his heart kept time with the tick of the clock as he anxiously gazed on the bowed head and sad face of his father, and awaited the issue of each call. Name after name was distinctly pronounced, lip after lip touched the image, and every boy of four classes re- seated without producing a Bible.   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     231 "ewellyn Bryant," read Dr. Ostend, touching the top of the crucifix as he advanced. Lewellyn bowed. "' Take the oath, my son," said the Professor. "I possess a Bible, sir.' President Vonberg arose--"Your possession of that book, Master Bryant, led to the present examina. tion; that book you received from the most powerful disseminator of heresy Germany has produced since the lays of Martin Luther. I trust it is not too late to save our institution from the diabolical ma- chinations of Gustavus Weber. As principal officer- of this College, I demand the book." With burning cheek and faltering hand, Lewellyn produced the Bible and laid it on the table. "' Your oath that it is the only one, Master Bryant." Lewellyn took up his Bible, slowly raised it to his lips, and replaced it. "The insignia of our own Church, Master Bryant," said Dr. Ostend, again touching the crucifix. Lewellyn stepped backward a few paces, bowed, and folded his arms. "Take your seat, Master Bryant," said Dr. Von- berg, unwilling to begin a controversy of dubious victory'. The name of Leopold Extien was next called, which produced great excitement, his father being one of the Professors. He came forward with a Bible in his hand, and laid it by the side of Bryant's; for some reason, neither he nor the next nine Bible readers     232     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. were tested by an oath. Dr. Ostend now held the roll of the head class; all eyes were planted on it in eager expectation. "Now for my back-log," whispered Hess Winter- steen, " no quarter for him in Dr. Antoine Ostend's heart, the rocks are mush to it." "Hush," returned his annoyed classmate, "they are all called but Vancleve." Each had borne testimony to their fidelity to the Church of the Virgin by kissing the crucifix. "Master Vancleve," said Dr. Ostend, laying his finger forcibly upon the image. As the name of his son was pronounced, Baron Vancleve raised his head, and for a moment fastened his eyes upon him; but his position was resumed almost instantly. Ernest stood a few feet from the platform. "You will approach, take the oath, or produce the book, Master Vancleve." In a low, clear, distinct voice, Ernest replied: "At the call of my country, or even at the summons of the burgomaster, I might be induced to declare my fealty to the one, or recognize the authority of the other, by an oath; but in this presence, before the officers of this Board, before my preceptors, my peers, and my compeers, my word must be sufficiently binding." "The truthfulness of master Vancleve," remarked the President, "has always been undoubted. Your Bible, or your reliable word that you possess none."   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     233 "I do not own the book; my father has the only one I ever called my own. But, gentlemen, if to have indelibly impressed upon the memory, and in the heart, the four Gospels of the Evangelists, the whole of the Epistles, all of the Psalms, and very, very many detached texts from the old Testament, will charge on me the possession of the Scriptures, I plead guilty!" There was a murmur very like applause, which a scowl from the President rebuked; the silence now was death-like. "Are you also indebted to young Weber for your volume?" demanded Dr. Weiss. "I held my book sacred to the memory of one now a heavenly worshipper; it was her gift. The head of his father sank lower at these words. "Unless I am greatly mistaken, Ernest Yancleve," said the President, "you will have severe compunc- tions when you reflect on the sentiments you have uttered in presence of your own father, of this august assembly, and before jthe sacred representation of the Son of our Blessed Madonna; for that have you lost all veneration?" Ernest paused until Dr. Vonberg had finished speaking, then advancing a few steps nearer his fa- ther, he said, in his deep, clear tones, "As a mem- ber of this College, I appeal to this honourable body collectively and individually, to testify to my con- duct during the term of my scholarship, whether beneficial or injurious to the fraternity."     234     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. The head of Baron Vancleve suddenly raised, and Dr. Vonberg met his eye as he arose to answer. "Until you were suspected of having a Bible, Master Vancleve, in the name of the school, from the principal officer to the youngest lad, I avow your conduct during the entire collegiate course to have been unexceptionable." Ernest bowed; the applause of the boys was din- ning the next few minutes. Ernest stood with one hand on his father's chair, his eyes cast on the floor during the tumult. When order was again restored, his voice once more broke on the silence. "The veneration required towards that representation of the Saviour, with my views I dare not offer. The whole ground of my salvation is based on the Son of the Blessed Virgin, through the atonement made on the cross, which that represents. I hope to be saved, and cannot be, I know, in any other way. I believe every representation made by man, and presented to man, to be a 'graven image.' God is a Spirit, and must be worshipped in spirit and in truth. What- soever others may do, with my belief it would be idolatry to bow down to any representation of the Deity, forbidden in the word of God." "Does Ernest Vancleve, the only male descendant of the ancient house of Vancleve, the able supporters of the Papacy centuries back, avow himself a heretic in the very ears of his father?" exclaimed Professor Vance, much excited. "My father is not ignorant of my opinions, Dr. /   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     235 Vance; my only grief is that they grieve him. But"-and raising his clasped hands over his head, with flushed cheek and kindling eye he exclaimed, "the Heights of Eidelberg shall be melted away, and the rocks of her shores be ground to powder, but O may I never be suffered to deny my faith in thee, Jesus, my Saviour." By a powerful effort, after a short pause, he calmly laid his hand upon. his heart, as he very distinctly said, "I am a Protestant!" The President silently waived him to be seated. After the lapse of a few minutes, Dr. Vonberg read a list of the names of the offenders. "Young gentle- men," he added, as he closed the paper, "you have leave of absence until to-morrow." They arose, in regular order, bowed to the speaker, and obeyed. Ernest Vancleve was the last named; he arose also, with flashing eye, and for a time the power of speak- ing was suspended by indignation, but suppressing his ire, he advanced in front of the platform, and more calmly than could have been anticipated, said, "Will the Honourable President point his finger to the instance where the laws of this Institution have been infringed by me?" He stood with one hand thrust between the buttons of his vest, the other ex- tended towards his judges. He might have been taken for the personification of haughtiness and scorn, yet relieved by an eye beaming with the consciousness of truth and innocence.

"If that misnamed poison, Dr. Vonberg, had never entered this house through any other channel, it would have been unnecessary to have called this meeting; my Bibli never was in the school." "Are you certain of that, Master Vancleve?" "Your quere, Dr. Vonberg, would question my reliability; you will allow it to pass." At this Baron Vancleve changed his position on his chair. The President coloured slightly, told him to take his seat, and continued: "It will require some time for the Board to resolve what course will be advisable towards the delinquents." "If I may be permitted to speak," interrupted Pro- fessor Vance, "I would recommend great lenity; by gentle persuasions our misled youth may be induced to return to the bosom of the Church. As to the volumes, I do not care to cast a vote upon them; they will answer to light the cigars of Dr. Weiss." "It would be well, in my opinion," retorted that gentleman, "to dismiss the school before other simi- lar suggestions are made." After a brief cold lecture on the heinousness of apostasy, from the President, Professor Basil Weiss gave the classes permission to withdraw, and shortly after the whole body adjourned. "The next move," said Hess Wintersteen, with a scream of laughter, as he passed out of the College avenue with a few of his class, "the next mighty move must be a permission from Rome to bless the waters of the Niese.

I'm thinking their Reverences outwitted themselves this morning. I for one will not long lack a Bible, and many a fellow who never thought of it before, will be curious to find out whether Vancleve's texts were spurious or not. I tell you what," he continued, more seriously, " there must be something in a book that never seemed to trouble any but the"-he lowered his voice and looked around cautiously-".but the wicked. Well, I mean to read for myself;" and he laughed loud again. "I may be a Dominie too, some time. "You do not think that Vancleve will come to that, do you, Hess?" asked Hans Wirtz. "Yes, just as certain of it as those rocks stand." "Pity it happened before commencement; he will have to leave." "Not a peg; he has read the Charter as well as the Bible, and if that give him liberty to remain, he will not go, I'll bet; and don't Vonberg know that his father is a rich Baron, eh! Wirtz?" "I suppose so," returned the other, with a sigh, "he knows, and Ifeel I am obscure." "'Make a name, Hans; who knows but we may both be Dominies?" "I do not think I will have anything to do with that book, Hess, even to obtain great reputation," he' replied, with a faint smile. "Yes, you will, depend upon it, Hans. I expect to be Bible agent to more than half our fellows. 21      238     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERGO Mark me, the next of such investigations will pro- duce so many of these books, Vance will have to propose a partner or two to Weiss. Look yonder at Moulter, how he is holding forth to that lot of fel- lows." Applying two fingers. to his lips and shrilly whistling through them, he drew the attention of the circle, and the boys all advanced towards him and his friends. "I'll bet, Moulter, you were not saying a word about proscribed books." The boys laughed. "Then I'll bet you were. I tell Hans I am for find- ing that book out 'good' or 'evil;' the best folks I know are Bible readers, the sworst are its rejecters; this certainly argues favourably for it. I do not say positively. I will own a Bible before that tide ebbs once more, and will not refuse to lend," he added, archly, "and strongly advise memorizing; there was no minority." Wirtz halted at first, from fear of discovery, but confessed he was as anxious as any of them to gain a knowledge of its contents, if he could without detec- tion. The hour and place was agreed upon, and Hess appointed to procure the book. Other groups passed down the different avenues in close conversation. Dr. Vonberg's man and boat were awaiting him; he crossed the river alone. Lady Vancleve had sent Michael with the carriage. Ernest and his father rode home in silence. Mr. Oberlin- and his family were there; the day was passed in mutual inquiries, visiting the grounds, hives, aviary-all the beauties and curiosities connected with the chateau.   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      239 Ernest longed for the hour when he could pour into his sister's ear the whole detail of the circum- stances of the morning. The opportunity was not afforded until the family had retired for the night, then tapping at her door, and gladly obeying her "come in," he gave her a full account of all the occurrences. Adele heard him through with intense interest. When he had finished, she twined her arms over his shoulder and said, her eyes swimming with tears, "God be praised for such a brother; may I as ably support His cause when called upon." "With you, Adele," he replied, returning her caress, "it will be more gradual; be assured, 'As your day is, your strength will be.'" "And you, dear Ernest," she said sweetly, "hav- ing put your hand to the plough, must not look back." "Nor will I, with your prayers to uphold me, my sister." He was bidding her good night, when he espied Cassy on the bed: "Why!" he exclaimed in surprise, "how did you contrive to separate Bertha and that baby?" "A little contest between her and her cousins did it," replied Adele, trying to laugh: "see, the play- house has been ordered in here by its owner, and this is to be her refuge until Miss Kate Oberlin says farewell. The boys, too, tried the little creature con- siderably, by hiding her dolls, and running off with her drawings, but I do not think they can trouble her any more."     240     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "I certainly will thrash those boys on the first re- petition of their mischief. Gassy shall not be made unhappy by them," said Ernest, indignantly. "No, no, dear, take no notice of them, I intend to shield her from all their little ugly ways." Ernest said no more, but leaning over, he kissed the rosy cheek of the little sleeper, and retired to his own chamber, where he soon realized the verity of the passage, "He giveth his beloved sleep." The next day was devoted to his uncle, and the boys; sailing, riding, entertaining them in every way imaginable; while his sister exhausted her powers in endeavouring to meet the many caprices of Miss Kate, and screening little Cassy from what she called "jokes." "Your brother," observed Baroh Vancleve to his wife, the next evening, "is fearful of heretic influ- ence on his sons." "Any might improve them," she replied, with something between a smile and a sneer, "but why does he leave them in the house with Ernest, if his fears are so pungent?" "I do not know, but I do know they will be a double handful, Henriette." "I think so, indeed. I was greatly amused at Cassy's preparations for her siege last evening. I met her carrying her night clothes over her little arms into her sister's room from the nursery, and 'Bertha looking like a Tartar, rolling her playhouse in after her. I asked no questions, suspecting the truth,          A.   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      241 but Bertha muttered out, 'she has no peace any more in her own nursery;' but we must all try to bear with them; they are under no control at home; the example of Ernest may be infinitely beneficial to them, notwithstanding his heresy." "O! that he had been pleading on any other than the cause of Protestantism yesterday; as it was, I could not but feel proud of our noble boy, he pro- claimed his sentiments with so much gentleness, yet so boldly." "I almost shrink from telling you, Lorenzo, but our dear Adele absolutely refused to give any opinion about the expediency of a confessional, when converse ing with Dr. Bryant about her brother's apostasy, and was silent upon other duties incumbent on the fol- lowers of the Virgin." "I would rather, Henriette, leave all these sub- jects with you, I have been so very unsuccessful in my efforts to dissuade Ernest from his phantom. I am unwilling to raise the same siege against our daugh- ter; I certainly have suspected her non-allegiance; the confirmation of her apostasy would be a weight too grievous to be borne. Do not compel me to inquire; investigate, if you will, for your own satisfac- tion, dear Henriette-the result sepulchre in your own bosom. Father Antoine suggests, as our only retriev- ing step, to devote little Gassy to the Blessed Lady." "I could not have answered him patiently, Lorenzo. What was your reply?" "That it was too true, the mind of our boy had 21*      242     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. strayed from its proper channel; yet the hearts of all my family were as onela disunion could not be." "Did he not find that unanswerable?" said Lady Vancleve, twining her fingers through her husband's hair, as she stood by the side of his chair. "Yes, he was silenced, but not satisfied. After a little hesitancy, he told me I would be judged for my foolish fondness for my children; that my pliability had occasioned the ruin of Ernest. I cannot believe this, much as I reverence his opinion generally. Ours are remarkable children, Henriette; even Cassy is the wonder of Eidelberg. Her observations on passing events, and on the remarks of your visitors, are really astonishing; she will make a great woman. Adele appears to me faultless; and Ernest has a colossal mind." "Do finish off the picture," interrupted Lady Vancleve, laughing, as she sat down on the stool at his feet, "by giving their mother as flattering a flourish." "She is my beau ideal of all that is beautiful in form and spirit," said the Baron, laughing himself at his extravagant praise of his family. "Well, I will not ask to add my husband to the group, or to his family pride might be united personal vanity."  "I will not attempt to outstrip that, Henriette; it is too extra a finish. And here comes Ernest." "Mamma in the attitude of a supplicant! I came to take that place myself," said Ernest, pleasantly;   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     243 and, raising his mother from her position, he seated her on the sofa, and dropped on one knee at her feet. "What is it I am expected to grant to so humble a petitioner?" inquired his mother, laughing; "name your boon, sir." "IndeeF1, mother/, he replied, rising, and flinging himself beside her, "I do so much wish to take little Cassy sailing. Carl has invited me, with Kate Oberlin and the boys, to try his renewed 'Sea Bird.' It has beentrepaired and painted most beautifully by Captain Blucher's sailors. They did it without his knowledge, and Carl is so gratified. She is a very safe craft, mother-Cassy would enjoy it so much. You know there is not a superior oarsman to Carl Ravenscroft in the province. Will you consent, mother?" "No, dear, much as I dislike to disappoint you, I cannot allow Cassy to enter a boat, unless her father goes; besides, we intend riding to-morrow. Lorenzo, you have made your arrangements to pay calls with me over the ' Vine Slopes?' ' "Yes, I have; and, my son, Itoo think it rather a risk for Cassy to accompany you in these excursions on the water. You had better not persuade your mother against her will; if anything should happen to your sister, I am sure your heart would be the latest in the healing." Ernest quietly rubbed his mother's ring up and down upon her finger. At length he asked, in a sub- dued manner,  Whom shall I invite as a companion for Kate, as Cassy is out of the question?"     244     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERO. "I have heard Miss eta Vance say she loved sail- ing," answered his father "you had better engage her."  "Very disjointed kind o companionship," said Lady Vancleve, with an amued smile; "I should suppose Miss Meta as much too advanced in years for Kate, as your sister is the contrary." "Kate is superior to Miss Vance, excepting in age; and it is not speaking much for Cassy, to say that she is quite equal to either of the young ladies." "Ridiculous, Ernest! Meta is seventeen years old!" "I know that; but upon my word, father, she never makes a remark that my memory can retain a minute." Baron Vancleve stirred the fire assiduously. Lady Vancleve kissed the forehead, now resting on her lap, and whispered, "You are severe, Master Vancleve." "The bridge is progressing in good earnest," re- marked the Baron, when he had fairly digested the last speech of his son. "Our Burgomaster thinks it a 'mighty piece of nonsense;' he says the scholars will forget how to man a boat, or handle an oar." "Old Langdorfe? I do believe, father, excepting your agent, Brock, there is not a more sordid, con- tracted spirit on the Heights." "Brock's agency closes with the year, and I doubt if he will retain the others; he has shown himself an   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      245 oppressor, and, as such, will not be endured by the patrons he has had hitherto." "From Wintersteen's reports of him, I only wonder he has been kept in employ so long." "But, dear," said his mother, "you have not acknowledged you were severe on the character of your Professor's daughter." "I am sorry to be severe, mother, but every since father asked me what I thought of Miss Vance, I have observed her more particularly, and cannot per- ceive any intellect, and not very much more heart; yet she is good-humoured, plays and sings exquisitely, and of course will pass well in fashionable society. But I certainly must engage her, or some other lady, to accompany Kate to-morrow," he said, rising from the sofa. "Tony Bryant, dear?" "Yes, mother, I will invite both. Can Peter be spared, father? I do not feel much inclined to go out this evening." "Not better than his horse, Ernest; there will be a propriety in making a visit to both ladies, and much more probability of their acceptance of your own- in- vitation." Ernest smiled, buttoned on his overcoat, and dis- appeared. "I almost wish," said Baron Vancleve, "that boy would sometimes swerve a little from such perfect obedience; if he would do some trifling Wrong action, I might get up some excuse to be angry with him;     246     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. but, as Vonberg expressed it, " his conduct is always unexceptionable." "I confess I desire no alteration in our son, as far as regards this world and ourselves; and you would not be less grieved than myself, Lorenzo, to see the slightest deviation from principle in him." "Perhaps so, dear; I have no settled ideas; my reasonings must appear to you very vague; I am un- able to form any plans." The entrance of Adele and Kate turned the con- versation; they were afterward joined by Mr. Oberlin and his sons. Ernest returned late. The next day's excursion was talked over, and great pleasure antici- pated by the young people. "What girls are going?" asked Kate Oberlin. "Miss Vance and Miss Bryant," answered Ernest. "I am glad you asked Miss Vance, coz; I will teaze her to sing all the time-I like to hear her sing." "I hate music," returned one of her brothers; "I hope she will refuse." "Let us all sing as loud as we can, Osk; it will be fun." Ernest looked steadily at them a minute, then slowly withdrawing his eyes, he entered into conver- sation with his uncle on a different subject. The time for retiring was never more welcome, though his anticipations of the morning's sail was any other than pleasant; he wished that over with the evening, and he hailed the dark clouds, when he awoke, as harbin-   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      247 gers of good, and did not express the slightest con- cern when the rain poured down in torrents, and disappointed the party of their excursion on the river. Carl 'offered his boat the next fair day, but Ernest excused himself upon the plea of very urgent busi- ness, and never after found leisure to take the sail.  CHAPTER IX. THE sun was sinking far behind the hills of Eldel- berg, and the gray twilight closing rapidly; almost imperceptibly, darkness was stealing over the face of nature. Gustavus Weber had-drawn his table closer to the window to catch the last glimpse of light to enable him to continue some writing, in which he was apparently much interested. It was at length finish- ed, folded, placed in an envelope, and about being directed, when a gentle tap at his door interrupted him. A discontented look as he raised his head toward it, was the only reply, and he continhed writing. A second' summons, however, forbade further delay; and, with a "Pshaw!" he threw thehletter on the table, and opened the door. Lewellyn- Bryant stood before him, his face flushed, and he evidently much agitated.' "I have come to take leave of you, Gustavus.' "{ Take leave!" 4'Yes I I sail with my father to-morrow."     248     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "Lewellyn, you astonish me! Come, be seated, and tell me the reason for the change in your father's arrangements. But excuse me one moment, first." The lamp was quickly lighted, the name placed upon the envelope, the bell rung, and directions given to Peter (a man belonging to the College), who answered the summons, to give that letter into the hands of Ernest Vancleve. "And now, Lewellyn," he con. tinued, seating himself beside him, "tell me the meaning of your sudden departure." "I must only guess at the cause myself," he re- plied; " no reason is assigned by my father, except that it is in accordance with his wishes that I should be placed at one of the schools of Heidelberg for three years. A private conference with Father Antoine, on the evening previous, probably settled the matter. The fear of the light (misnamed by our Confessor, heresy,) that is creeping into the College, notwith- standing all their efforts to prevent it, has perhaps alarmed my father for me. The influence of Ernest Vancleve also may be dreaded.  He and I have always been bosom friends; a tie which could scarcely be broken, even by the wiles of Father Antoine. O, that I had the independence of Ernest; I should then fear little the influence of all the Jesuit priests and Romanists of Switzerland." "That was his peculiar characteristic always," re- plied Gustavus. "When quite -a little boy at college, if any one was treated ungenerously, owing to the want of fortune, birth, &c., he was sure to be singled   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     249 out by Ernest, and invited to spend the Sabbath at his house; a privilege which all coveted." "Had you seen him yesterday, Gustavus! There has been some secret informant in the midst of us." "Have you any suspicions as to whom?" "Not any; it is closely locked in the bosom of Father Antoine. He is as secret as the grave." "What has the traitor been unfolding in regard to you?" "That I was in possession of a Bible." "Did you ever name it, Lewellyn?" "Not to mortal; but the question was asked me by my father before I had given him the slightest ground for suspicion. The day following, a commit. tee was nominated to examine into the state of the schools, and each boy obliged to swear solemnly that he did not own a Bible. No less than twelve were produced. When the turn of Ernest came, he re- fused positively to be bound by any thing but his simple word; to this they were obliged to accede, knowing that opposition would be in vain. He told them his Bible had been resigned into the hands of his father; but he would confess that his mind was filled with its holy truths; that light had beamed in upon his soul, never to be eradicated; and, that with- out the book, he could now go forward, rejoicing him- self, and ready to point out to others the only path that conducts to life eternal." The eye of Gustavus was fixed with intense interest on Lewellyn as he proceeded. "His father, as a 22     250     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. trustee, was of course present. His head was bowed, and the expression of his countenance sad in the ex- treme; but he remained silent. As Ernest finished, he glanced an anxious look at his father, and returned to the seat he had before occupied. Every eye was bent upon him, and the breathless stillness was so great, that the ticking of the clock was plainly heard. I saw a glance exchanged between the two con- fessors-such a glance; the compressed lip of Father Antoine, and the almost Satanic expression on the countenance of Father Basil, made me tremble for my friend as I looked into the future for him." "They may make domestic difficulties, but in this Republic their efforts are almost powerless." "Their shafts are far from pointless, Gustavus. To have his name erased from the list of graduates; to be arrested in his collegiate course, which he was pursuing with so much honour-this would indeed be bitter to a mind like Ernest's." "Would they dare proceed so far." "Three things only would deter them-first, the wealth and standing of the Baron; second, President Vonberg wishes to ingratiate himself with a Pro- testant family; third, Professor Vance looks forward to the day when Ernest will become his son-in-law." "What! Ernest Vancleve the husband of Meta Vance!" exclaimed Gustavus, indignantly-" who has fabricated such a strange report?" "A report with some foundation, Gustavus, or I have no observation. On the day of the sail, he even   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     251 permitted his sister Adele, in whose hadow he lives, to be accompanied by Tony to the boat, while he escorted Miss Meta Vance. And if you had been present at her father's lecture, your skepticism on this subject would all have vanished. His devotion to Miss Meta was not to be misunderstood; he even waited upon her home, although my father offered his carriage to Mrs. Vance, which, of course, obviated all necessity for his attendance." "My surprise and disappointment know no bounds. What attraction can he find in Meta Vance?" "Her exquisite beauty, both of face and form." "But she is so insipid, so unimaginative, so-so altogether unlike himself; and, I have understood, a most bigoted Romanist." "She is, so far as form goes, but is entirely igno- rant of Church history; but she has a shrine in her chamber, to which she resorts three times a day. This alliance will enable Father Antoine to carry out his measures more fully to bind the fetters of Ro- manism upon Ernest. Depend upon it, he will leave no means untried to bring him back into the Mother Church." "Rash, rash young man!" exclaimed Gustavus. "Truly, Miss Vance is a light fetter to succeed in binding him." "It is more surprising to me," replied Lewellyn, "contrasting her with such a sister as he has-you know Adele."     252     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "I have seen her at her father's," replied Gusta- vus, colouring deeply. "Then I need not dwell upon her attractions; none could see without admiring her." "I must leave you now, Gustavus," said he, rising, and extending his hand to his friend. It was taken, and pressed warmly. "Will you add another favour to the many you have already bestowed?" c Any thing you may ask, Lewellyn, I promise." "Will you present me with another Bible? I dare not purchase one; it would be discovered by one or other of the Confessors; they are everywhere at the same moment, and nothing escapes their vigilance. &My mind is not so well stored with its precious truths  as that of Ernest. No I it is a perfect chaos; and when I look into the future, I may well apply those words of Young to myself, 'Night, in the zenith of its dark domain, Is sunshine to the colour of my fate."' "Do not despond, Lewellyn; take this Bible-it has been my daily companion for two years; every passage that impressed me particularly I have marked; many of them will suit your case. Not only read, but  study them. Search the Scriptures with prayer, and a blessing will surely follow; take every opportunity of making yourself acquainted with its contents. You are going into much temptation; you will perhaps not find a Christian friend. Keep near to the cross; make Jesus your Friend-you will need no other. You will correspond with me?"   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     253 Lewellyn shook his head despondingly. "No! Is there a prohibition?" "There is, Gustavus; you are known as the donor of the Bible." "Wel--'tis passing strange! Who can be the informant? "That we shall never know. I am forbidden in- tercourse with you, but may I ask an interest in your prayers." "Daily I will remember you, Lewellyn. Shall we not unite in prayer now, before we say farewell, per- haps for ever?" The word, farewell, struck a chord that vibrated in the heart of Lewellyn. He could command himself no longer, but burying his face in his hands, he sobbed aloud. His friend, still retaining his hand, seated himself beside him. "God is good, Lewellyn," he said gently, "and in the midst of temptation, pro- mises a way of escape." "You are a Protestant, Gustavus, and know nothing of the wiles of our priests; it is impossible to elude them, if once you are the object of their suspicions." "Throw off their yoke, Lewellyn; be not held in this miserable thraldom; come out, and declare your- self a Protestant-what can they do?" "So I intend, two years hence, when arrived at the age tf manhood. I will bow my neck to none save to Him whose yoke is easy, and whose burden is light, At present, I am under my father's jurisdiction. Dr. Bryant is a man, Gustavus, that would soon make a 22*      254     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. ^J Protestant son an outcast; as he now loves, so would his whole soul recoil from me. But let us unite in. prayer-the time is waning." They knelt; Gustavus offered a prayer that went to the heart of Lewellyn, and he arose strengthened, calm, and almost happy. Clasping his friend's hand in his, he said, "I must correspond with you, Gus- tavus; I will endeavour to escape detection. 'I must now take advantage of the darkness to see Ernest; he is proscribed also." Gustavus accompanied him to the door of the cha- teau, and again bidding him farewell, returned to his own chamber just as the College bell sounded the hour of ten. With a mind restless and troubled, he threw himself upon his bed. Image after image floated be- fore him. The situation of Lewellyn distressed him; his banishment from his native land, and deprivation of all Christian intercourse; but the predominant thought that pressed upon him was the alliance of Ernest. Could it be possible? Was Ernest Vancleve about making such a sacrifice voluntarily?-binding the fetters of Rome still more closely upon him by becoming a member of the family of Vance? He re- membered his noble intellect, his warm heart, his frank disposition. He had loved to dwell upon his Christian character, his independence in casting off errors which had bound his ancestors for centuries, and which were dearer to a much loved father than life itself. And what was he to gain in return?-a vain, flippant, silly girl-one whose only attraction   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     255 was outward appearance, and whose conversation, if such it might be termed, was of the most trifling order. There was also an undefined feeling that this step would throw a darker shadow over his prospects. Any access to Adele must be through his influence; the letter he had just written, was on a subject nearest his heart, written in the most confidential strain. Would he betray his trust? Able no longer to en- dure his feelings, he arose, and stirring up the dying embers, he threw his morning-gown around him, and seated himself in a large leather chair. For a long time he sat unconsciously watching the fire, as it slowly flickered, and gradually went out. His mind was taking a retrospect of his whole life; his child- hood passed before him, when his head was pillowed on his mother's bosom, and all his little cares and sorrows poured into her ear. Then, his boyish school- days, before leaving home, when guided by a father's counsel-now, so different--so alone, alone; no hu- man being with whom   to exchange a thought. Slowly, the image of Adele appeared before him, her countenance radiant with a heavenly smile. Then he saw a figure sitting absorbed in working some em- broidery; it was Meta Vance, preparing a pure white robe, to be presented to the Virgin. Ernest stood gazing upon her with an expression of the deepest woe, while Adele held towards her an open Bible. The text to which it pointed was this, "Wherefore do you spend your money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which -satisfieth not?" The \     256     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERM eye of Ernest rested upon it; he stood motionless. Gustavus watched the countenance of Adele; it was brilliant with a heavenly light. He tried to speak, but could not; he endeavoured to rise, but something chained him to the spot. Suddenly, she fixed her eye upon him, and pointing upward, clasped her hands around her Bible; then casting one sad look on Ernest, disappeared. Gustavus sprang up'to fol- low her, but the sudden exertion roused him, and he found he was indeed pursuing a phantom. The sun had long since risen, and was beaming through the casement. It was some time before he could col- lect himself sufficiently to recall the events of the preceding evening; when he succeeded in doing so, his recollections were of the most painful nature, and dressing himself, he sought the fresh air for a few moments, ere he endeavoured to obtain comfort from the word of God. Looking at his watch, he found it was almost eight, and hastily taking a light break- fast, he proceeded to the lecture-room, where Pro- fessor Oxenstein had arrived before him. Although, apparently, listening attentively, he' heard only the last words of the speaker-"This lecture will be care- fully noted by you, young gentlemen, as the same subject will be pursued for some days, one blending closely with the other." "Carefully noted," thought Gustavus; " were it one of the links in the chain of my destiny, my wan- dering thoughts would surely sever it." Seeking a retired spot on the banks of the Niese,   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      257 he seated himself upon the ledge of a rock overhang- ing the river; the spot was wild and beautiful. - Gus- tavus rested his wearied head upon his hand, and soon again became absorbed in thought. The future was before him; but not the dim future of his earthly being. It was on the threshold of his Father's king- dom he was standing; he had fought the good fight, he hadc finished his course, and he felt there was a crown of glory laid up for him, where no friend could disappoint, and where no affection could be blighted. Never had he enjoyed such bright views of heaven; never such an assurance vouchsafed him, that" his name was written in the Lamb's book of life. "This spot," said he, "is to me a consecrated place; here will I raise my Ebenezer-here devote myself anew to the service of my Lord and Master." On his knees he did so; and arose, feeling that with Jesus for his friend, the sorrows of this world were light indeed. He walked slowly up the river for nearly a mile, and was about returning, when he saw a carriage coming towards him, which he immediately recognized as the Vancleve equipage. As they drew near, the salutationi of Baron and Lady Vancleve was kind and cordial. The deep bow of Gustavus, though courteous, was grave and dignified. They had pro- ceeded but a few paces, when one- of the horses, tread- ing upon a sharp stone, fell. Little Cassy was sitting. beside Michael; Baron Vancleve sprang up, and attempted to seize her, but not succeeding, she was thrown out, her foot becoming entangled in the rein.     258     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. Gustavus rushed forward, caught the child in his arms, and freed the little foot just as the other horse, terrified beyond measure, darted off at full speed, scarcely giving the stumbler time to regain his foot- ing. A cryof agony from Lady Vancleve was all that Gustavus heard, and they were out of sight in a few moments. It was a long time before he succeeded in pacifying his little charge; at length she became quite interested in a pretty little bottle that he took from his pocket, ir order to bathe her foot, which she assured him was hurt; although when the shoe and stocking were removed, and a little white foot ap- peared, Gustavus could not discern the slightest injury. He however bathed it gently with the con- tents of the admired bottle, and, to her great delight, when emptied, placed it in her pocket; then wrap- ping the supposed injured limb carefully in his handkerchief, he proceeded towards the porter's lodge, where he found Mally, the wife of Michael. "Why, Mr. Weber!" she exclaimed, "where did you get Gassy? Has anything happened?" "The horse became restive, Mally, and Gassy was thrown out, but not hurt. I feared to take her to the house, as the carriage has not yet returned, and it might have alarmed Miss Adele unnecessarily.' "O, come in, Mr. Weber," said Gassy, laying her little white hand on his cheek, coaxingly; "I want to show you my sweet little pussy. Mally keeps it for me; she's named Meta." "Meta! And for whom may she be called?"   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     259 "For cousin Meta Vance." "Why, I did not know you had a cousin Meta." "Neither I haven't; but I love her, so I call her cousin Meta. She comes to see me very often, and brought me a beautiful doll, that she dressed all her- self; it's not named yet. Don't you think Mr. Weber will be a pretty name?" "Very," was the reply. "Then I'll call it Mr. Weber." "How is Miss Adele, Mally?" "I just came from the house, sir; lif you will leave Gassy with me, and step up, you will find her in the parlor with Miss Meta Vance. Mr. Ernest will soon come home from school; Miss Meta is spending the day with Miss Adele. Can you not walk up, sir?" "Not to-day. I must now bid you good-by, Gassy," Putting her arms closely round his neck, she kissed him most affectionately, saying, "Good-by, dear Mr. Weber; I love you dearly." The kiss was cordially returned; and Mr. Weber, seeing the carriage in the distance, again bade her good-by, and was soon out of sight, leaving little Cassy watching anxiously to catch another glimpse of her friend and deliverer. Her attention, however, was soon drawn to another object; and she shouted with ecstasy as her father and mother drove round the hills. "Our darling child!" exclaimed Lady Vandeve. "Can we be thankful enough for her wonderful pre- servation?"     260     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. Mally came to meet them; and placing Cassy on her mother's lap, they soon arrived at the chateau, and entered the room where the two young ladies and Ernest, who had joined them, were sitting. "You have ridden longer than you expected, mother," said Adele; "you have exceeded your time one hour." "A little faster, as well as longer," replied her mother, forcing a smile; "the horses were rather restive, and we were detained in consequence." "O, sister!" said Cassy, as she clung fondly to \.her neck, "I have had the most beautiful time!" "But what is the matter with the little foot?" in- quired Adele. That matter had evidently been entirely forgotten- but a sore subject was revived; her countenance sud- denly assuming a most laughably woful expression, she said,- "It was a very sore foot, sister." "Let me see it, Cassy." The bandage was re- moved in the most gentle manner, but no injury appeared. "Does it hurt you now, Cassy?" she asked. "O, no, sister; Mr. Weber cured it, and I've called my doll for him. He says its a very pretty name. Do you think it is, sister?" "Is this your handkerchief, papa?" asked Adele, anxious to change the painful subject, at the same time turning to the corner to see the name. "Gus- tavus Weber," in large letters, was marked upon it. Colouring deeply, she folded it, and raising her eyes   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     261 at the same moment, she met those of her father fixed upon her with the most sorrowful expression. -Soon after, he retired to his study. Lady Vancleve, on the plea of removing her bonnet, sought the privacy of her chamber to weep over the stern neces- sity which had blighted the happiness of a dearly loved daughter. The head of Adele was bent over Cassy, who still retained her seat in her lap, busily arranging her shoe and stocking.  "Sister, you have not kissed my foot," she said; "I told Mr. Weber it wasn't kissed yet, and he kissed it almost well-only one little spot, just there, sister?" The spot was pointed out precisely, the foot kissed, and the now satisfied little girl continued her reminis- cences, notwithstanding all the endeavours of Ernest to divert her attention from them. "But did you see nothing upon the river, Cassy?" he asked. "O, yes! I forgot, brotheri after my foot was almost welled, Mr. Weber picked me up some beauti- ful stones, and we threw them into the water, and they made it make beautiful rings. Andi showed him my sweet little cross, and told him Father Antoine gave it to me, and told me to pfay to it three times a day." "And what did he say?" asked Ernest, quickly. "I don't know, brother, I forget-I guess he didn't say any thing?"  "And do you pray to it, Cassy?" asked Miss Vance.   "No, I forget; I only say 'Our Father,' that bro- 23     262     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. ther taught me; and then my prayers to mamma, when I go to bed. I don't know how to pray to my little cross." "But, Cassy, what makes you wear it, if you don't know how to pray to it? Brother Ernest would teach you, if you asked him." "He would be a poor teacher," replied Ernest, coldly; the child would remain in ignorance for ever, if depending upon me for such knowledge. That piece of jet is one of the devices of man to delude the mind, and ensnare it by senseless forms." "Mr. Vancleve! you shock my very soul by the utterance of such sentiments," exclaimed Miss Vance, crossing herself most devoutly, and kissing a silver crucifix which was suspended from her neck. "The Holy Fathers constantly distribute them among their people, and consider them necessary to enable us to fix our attention on divine things. What would you place in their stead?" "The word of God," replied Ernest, solemnly; "' that is given to us for our instruction, but withheld from the laity by our clergy." "Would you infringe on the rules of your Church, Mr. Vancleve?" exclaimed Miss Vance. "Would you commit the deadly sin of impugning her motives, and, for a moment, doubt her infallibility? Should such thoughts intrude upon me, I should feel they were the suggestions of Satan, and should bring my- self to repentance by many and severe penances." Ernest awaited silently the conclusion, then very   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     263 calmly answered: "My Bible, which is no other than the inspired word of God, tells me that no severe penances are necessary, or even acceptable. Christ finished the work for us, when, upon the tree, he said, 'It is finished.' He requires no assistance from us. 'My yoke is easy, and my burden is light,' are his own words. And he assures us, that though our sins are as scarlet, he will wash them white as wool. 'Come unto me,' is his only request, land be ye saved.' 'Knock, and it shall be opened unto you; ask, and ye shall receive.' Search for yourself, Miss Vance; you will find the frail fabric upon which you have been leaning, will crumble under you; that the worship of even the Blessed Virgin is idolatry; that the intercession of saints is a device of man, and no- where to be found in the Holy Scriptures. Search the Scriptures, Miss Vance, search them for yourself; let no Church, no Confessor, no Jesuit priest mislead you. Depend upon it," he added, forgetting himself in his warmth, "you till find these sorry comforters on a bed of death. What will then be your burning candles, your measured prayers, your extreme unction, when the soul is hungering for the bread of life? And of what avail will be your highest mass when purgatory exists only in the imagination? No, no! depend upon it, the very moment the body and soul become disunited, that very moment our doom is sealed  for ever. Listen, O, listen, lest you realize all this when too late; before you are called to say, The har- vest is past, the summer is ended, and I am not Si     264     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. saved.' Forgive my frankness, but my Bible tells me to preach the gospel, whether my hearers listen or forbear." He stopped; there was a dead silence for a few moments; the cross of Meta had been kissed and re- kissed, but the expression of her countenance showed that the image had not answered the desired end. Turning to Adele, she said, "Can you allow your ear to be polluted with such awful heresy?-to hear the Holy Mother contemned?  O, Holy Mother!" she exclaimed, regardless of the presence of her friends, "Restore this dear youth into the right path, and not only persuade, but command thy Son to have mercy upon him, and may all the saints, whom 'he so much despises, intercede for him before he plunges into the depths of heresy, and becomes a Protestant indeed." As the prayer concluded, Cassy, who had been busily engaged in the corner, tying up her doll's foot, just remembered that she had not shown her new bottle which Mr. Weber had given her, and dropping dolly, at the risk of injuring her foot much more sorely, came running, with arms extended to Ernest. "See, brother, my beautiful bottle; is it not very pretty? Mr. Weber gave it to me." Even the name of Mr. Weber was welcome at this moment, notwithstanding the fear of exciting his sis- ter, as he felt himself placed in rather awkward cir- cumstances, and taking her on his knee, suffered himself -to be much entertained by her version of the bottle and its contents; then rising, he asked   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     265 to be excused, as he wished to see a friend before dinner. He proceeded immediately to the rooms of Gus- tavus, and hearing he had gone to the manse, con- cluded to pay a visit there also, as he would have time to do so before the dinner hour. He was, however, again disappointed; Gustavus had been there, Ber- trand told him, and had gone with Carl to make a visit to Dr.-Baden. He did not go in, as Mr. Ravens- croft was absent from home also, and Mrs. Ravens- croft was by no means an interesting companion to Ernest. Mrs. Vandoren had returned home, and Elsie had accompanied her cousin to boarding-school. He therefore recrossed the river, and hearing from Bertha that Miss Adele had gone up stairs to rest, and that his mother was with Miss Meta, he stole softly up to her apartment. She had fallen asleep upon her couch. Ernest seated himself quietly be- side her, and watched the expression of her counte- nance; he was surprised to see it so peaceful and happy. In about half an hour she awoke. "Are you here, dear Ernest?" she said, taking his hand as it lay beside her. "Yes, Adele; I was rejoiced to hear you had left the parlour, and came up soon after you." "I have been a dull companion," she replied, smiling. "No; I was pleased to find you sleeping so calmly; you needed rest." "I feel much refreshed, and am now able to enjoy 23*     266     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. a little talk alone with you. Father Antoine fears your influence at home; I heard him suggest to papa the necessity for watchfulness. I must confess," she added, smiling, "that neither of us are quite so staunch as Meta." "Was I imprudent, Adele, this morning?" "Not at all, Ernest; I rejoiced you were so faith- ful. Why should we fear to confess Christ, and him. crucified? O, that I could do so! I longed this morning to add my testimony to yours, and tell Meta of the Saviour I had found; but the time has not yet come. I would give worlds for the counsel of Gus- tavus." "His counsel would be," said Ernest, laughing, "to throw off one yoke, and take another; which would be much in accordance with your brother's views also." "I'll take that step when it is clearly defined in my own mind to be my duty. Until then, do not again make the proposition; you are placing tempta- tion in the way of a weak and erring mortal." Ernest shook his head, and was about replying, when the bell summoned them to dinner. Miss Vance looked surprised as he entered with his sister, but no remark was made. When the meal was concluded, she arose to go, saying she had an engagement to take tea with Annie Vanbremer. "As it is rather dusky, Miss Vance," said Ernest, reaching his hat at the same time, "allow me to accompany you."   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     267 There was no answer but a slight inclination of the head. Ernest observed she was most devoutly en- gaged, counting and recounting a beautiful rosary which she held in her hand. They were silent until they were opposite the Protestant College. "Mr. Vancleve," she asked, "do you sympathize with the regulations of that Institution?" "Its laws are built upon a firm foundation, Miss Vance," he replied, "my sympathies are entirely with them.  The word of God alone is taken for their guide." The rosary was counted steadily. "How strangely you have wandered from the faith of your fathers, Mr. Vancleve!" "On what is the faith of my father founded, Miss Vance?" "On the Holy Mother Church of course, but I would rather not converse upon the subject; I feel that heresy is so insidious, that I tremble at its very name." Ernest smiled. Iiss Vance continued-"Look at its baneful con- sequences, even. at the medical school, through the influence of one man-Gustavus Weber, the same, I suppose, who saved the life of Cassy this morning. Papa says he has a gigantic intellect, and is the moving principle of that Institution. Like Satan, he seems to be transformed into an angel of light, for the purpose of scattering poison through the College by the Bibles he disseminates, and the terrible ad- . . .. .

He lives in the house, papa says, just to entrap the stu- dents, denies himself nothing by doing so-has two rooms most- comfortably furnished-is waited upon most assiduously by the old woman who is a sort of matron there; and, as to Peter, papa cannot mention him without the utmost distress. He is entirely led by Mr. Weber, and from being one of the most faith- ful servants of the Church, has become one of the worst sort of heretics, proclaiming his dreadful tenets wherever he goes, and blasphemously blessing the Lord that he has been brought out of daakness into the marvellous light of the gospel. If it could only be arrested here-his subordinate situation prevents his exerting any decided influence; but unhappily, many young men of wealth and influence are tinctured through the exertions of this vile Mr. Weber. I should not wonder if the incident of this morning should afford him a pretext for making a visit to the chateau." "I do not think it will," was the reply. "And now, my dear Mr. Vancleve," she said, looking very mournfully into his face, as she took his proffered arm, to assist her over a rough place, "I much fear for you in your present state of mind, if you should be thrown into his society." "Until you change your views, Miss Meta, you and I can agree to differ." "That would be very necessary," she replied, cast- ing her eyes to the ground, with a face suffused   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     269 with blushes, t the only way that happiness could be insured." "But I hope to see the day that you and I will have more sympathy, that the Bible will impart to you the same comfort which I have experienced in studying its contents." "Never!" she exclaimed, vehemently; "that must be a prohibited subject between us. It was the agree- ment; I will listen to no new proposition." "Certainly not-I beg pardon for transgressing; but, 'out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh."' "There is one thing, Mr. Vancleve, that I wished to mention. I have a shrine in my chamber, to which I resort three times a day; that privilege I shall never relinquish." "The Virgin must feel neglected to-day," remarked Ernest, smiling. Miss Meta looked displeased, and answered gravely, "Not at all; to-morrow I will atone for it by more frequent visits." "I consider the posture of the body a matter of no consequence, while the heart is fixed on such frip- peries; but your heart, given elsewhere, will soon see the folly and the vanity of these trifling things." "I cannot think it will have that effect, or I should be unwilling to trust myself." The last words were lost on Ernest, as his thoughts had wandered far away to Gustavus Weber, and his influence in the College. l '       F :? I5; .  ^'^i      270     HEIG]TS OF EIDELBERG. They now reached the door of Mr. Vanbremer, and Ernest, extending his hand to Miss Vance, said, "( Ponder well this subject, Miss Vance; and may you at some future day fully accord with me in what is nearest my heart." "You will mention the subject to my father, Ernest; without his sanction I can do nothing." Supposing this was spoken satirically, he replied, "I fear he would entirely disappoint my hopes. Turn away from all earthly advisers; let your shrine be deserted for a day. Go to the Saviour; ask him to teach you your duty. Good afternoon, Miss Vance; I have an engagement at seven." "Good-night, Ernest," she replied; "Meta, in future, if you please." Ernest felt surprised, but bowed politely. "Let it be as you wish," he replied; "Meta, then, rather than Miss Vance." What a mixture he is, thought Meta, as she entered the house, much pleased in the main with her sup- posed new position; his head is so full of his new reli- gion, that he almost forgets how to address a lady. Either religion or love seems to have turned his brain. He seems to think, with some reason, that papa would not approve of a heretic; but he knows my strength. As Ernest repassed the window of Gustavus, that faced the river, he looked towards it, intending, if he could see anything of his friend, to make him a visit, and talk over not only the events of the morning, but the subject matter of the letter also.   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG;     271 Gustavus had been sitting at the window, as Ernest and Miss Vance passed, conversing so earnestly toge. ther, and drew back as he returned, believing his fears in regard to her would be confirmed. Ernest, seeing nothing of him, and concluding he had not yet returned, passed on to the chateau. The next morning, after the family were seated at the breakfast table, Baron Vancleve entered. He had just parted with Father Antoine, with whom he had been closetted for the last hour, in his library. His countenance. wore an expression of sadness; but he made no remark as he took his accustomed seat. "Adele had a restless night," said Lady Vanoleve, "and prefers not rising to breakfast. Get her tete-a-tete set, Charlotte, and make her a little cream- toast, and return for a cup of tea." The servant left the room, and the remainder of the meal was taken in silence. As the Baron rose from table, he said, "I feel it is my duty, Henriette, to see Mr. Weber, and express the deep obligation we feel under to him for the in- estimable service he has rendered us. I will endea- vour to get there before he leaves home for College." "I will accompany you, father," said Ernest, rising, and taking his hat, "as far as my College door." The brow of his father lowered, and an expression almost amounting to scorn was upon his lip, as he said in a low, tremulous voice, "You have no longer a seat there, my son; here is a note to that effect, signed by our two Confessors." 9  .      272     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. Ernest took the paper, and with flashing eye, read and re-read its contents. It ran thus: "September, - . "Master Ernest Vancleve is permitted to resign his seat in the Eidelberg College of St. Gabriel, which will be considered vacant from this day. Signed,   BASIL WEISSE, ANTOINE OSTEND." It was again folded, and returned to his father. "The note is directed to you, father-if it were to me, I sAuld consign it to the flames. It is entirely illegal, having no signatures but Drs. Ostend and Weisse. The others had not moral courage to brave your displeasure. I shall not resign, but shall resume my seat until a regular dismissal obliges me to vacate it, signed by the whole committee; and I will write a note to that effect. They will not dare cast such a reproach upon my name and house. Father, shall I accompany you as far as th( College dbor?" "As you deem right, m  son. I think you are pursuing the proper course; he ground they have assumed is certainly untenable. "Look, Vonstadt!" exclaimed Hess Wintersteen, as Ernest entered-" take a view; I wonder what's the matter now with Vancleve? That lip's pretty curly, and that step's tolerably majestic, considering he is stuffed so full of the Bible-that ought to make him meek as a lamb. Look! look!-he is placing a   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      273 note upon the President's table!-I wonder what the nation it's about? "I cannot tell," replied Vonstadt, " nor do I wish to pry into other people's affairs; but, whatever may be the cause, it certainly is righteous indignation." "Righteous indignation!-a pretty phrase, truly; giving one of your meek fellows a 'pretty chance of thrashing his neighbour." A touch of the bell for silence, interrupted him. The roll was called by Professor Extien. "Lewis Bremer." "Ernest Vancleve is present, sir; his name always stands head," answered Bremer. Mr. Extien started, and glanced towards the Presi- dent; the next moment -the name   Ernest Van- cleve" was called, to which a very distinct answer of "Present," was given, and the recitations proceeded as usual. Baron Vancleve passed on to the rooms of Mr. Weber. Gustavus was at home, and received him most courteously, placing a chair near the fire, as the day was dull, and the air raw and cold. "I feared, Mr. Weber," said the Baron, "had I left my visit to a later hour, I should have been dis- appointed in seeing you. As the deliverer of my child, I desired to express my gratitudle in person." "All obligations, if any were due, Baron Van- cleve," replied Gustavus, smiling, ( is entirely repaid by the pleasure I enjoyed with the little prattler. Ernest well names her the pride of Eidelberg.'-" 24     274     EIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "d Mr. Weber is an uncommonly agreeable young man," thought the Baron--"would he were only a Catholic." "She is our pride, Mr. Weber," he replied, with a very bright look, "and for fraternal affection, you must make all due allowanos." "Cassy entertained me so well, that-the anatomical lecture entirely escaped my memory. We remained upon the shore quite an hour. I examined her foot carefully, and do not think it received any injury." "Mr. Weber's surgical skill is, in her mind, unsur- passed, and she has immortalized you by naming her doll Mr. Weber." "There is certainly something very peculiar about Cassy," remarked Mr. Weber, "did you ever observe the low tones of her voice so much resemble the drip- ping of water, and the highest notes, at the time of her greatest excitement, are so modulated, they never grate, for a moment, upon the ear." "You seem to remember our little girl very kindly, Mr. Weber; it is always grateful to a parent's heart to have a child more than appreciated." "How could I ever forget one so attractive? and you may remember Baron Vancleve, before my visits were prohibited, how the little girl wound herself around my heart-the separation from her, cost me no little pain."  "Had I known it, she should have been your daily visitor."   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     275 "It is better to have no reminder," replied Gus-. tavus, mournfully. "Would that we could accord in some points con- cerning our Church, my dear bustavus. With what joy would we then receive you as a son, and with what confidence would we resign to your care our much loved daughter." "That boon would indeed be a precious one, Baron Vancleve, and my happiness too great to be realized." "Believe me, Gustavus, severing this tie has cost me days and nights of anguish." "And I feel that without Adele, this world is a barren wilderness; with her, my sum of bliss would be complete." "The Baron looked much idisturbed, I fear I have excited hopes never to be realized. If anything but her eternal happiness had been at stake, I could not have been supported under such a trial, but I firmly believe that our Holy Mother, in whose power you have no belief, looked down with pity upon her son, and gave me strength to perform my duty." "Baron Vancleve," replied Gustavus, with his eye fixed intently upon him, as though he held his destiny in his hand, "I worship the same Saviour with your- self; I daily pray for the teachings of his Spirit; I endeavour to do my duty to God and man. I hold the same sentiments with Ernest. Trust me with Adele; I do not think I will ever abuse your confi- dence. I will endeavour to be all a son could be, O! do not again crush the hopes you have excited.     276     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. Make not this world more desolate, if possible, than before. I have wept at the dying bed of a mother, such a parent as few have known. I have seen the last look, and heard the last admonition of an affec- tionate father. I have been bereaved of two loved sisters, the last link to life; all human ties being removed, I looked forward only to a glorious resurrec- tion. I met Adele, I loved her, and confessed it to her; she responded to it, and again I lived. I knew no obstacle to our happiness; I supposed the smile of Baron Vancleve would be upon our union. I asked. You know the sequel." The head of Baron Vancleve sank low, as the plaintive story of Gustavus proceeded; his whole frame shook with agitation; and burying his face, he wept. Gustavus remained perfectly silent for some time; at length he spoke. "Say that I have your sanction to this union. O! remember what is staked upon your answer."' "Let it rest until the evening, my son, my dear Gustavus," replied he, taking his hand in both of his, and pressing it affectionately, "let me review it when more calm. I would consult Mrs. Vancleve on so important a matter." "At the earliest hour, sir, in pity, let me have your decision. Imagine what the suspense must be." Shaking his hand convulsively, Baron Vancleve hurried from his presence. The eye of Gustavus followed him in the distance, and his heart sickened   HEIGHTS O  EIDELBERG.     2" when he saw Father Antoine suddenly emerge from behind a rock, and join him as he went toward the chateau. "My doom is sealed," he said, aloud, as he tossed himself despairingly into a chair, "if that man is to be the arbiter." "Who is to be the arbiter of your destiny, Gusta- vus?" said a voice, close beside him. He started, and looked up. Ernest Vancleve stood before him. "The door was open, and I entered,' he said. "I am glad, at last, to find you at home." I  At home! Ernest, I was not aware you had fa- voured me with a call for a long time." "You are mistaken; yesterday I twice missed you. But I have little time for explanation, as it is only recess. I have much to tell, and many things to hear from you. In the first place, what of my father's visit?" "Whether for good or evil, Ernest, depends upon the issue. That is to be decided this evening." "Decided! How?" "That I am afraid will depend too much on the will of Dr. Ostend to have a happy termination." The whole conversation was then related. Er- nest, forgetting his own troubles, sympathized deeply with the more poignant sorrows of his friend. "It is within a few minutes of the school hour; I must leave you now, Gustavus, but at five this even- ing I will again be with you. I need your counsel 24*     278     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. in my own matters also, but shall not trouble you with them while your mind is thus harassed. All must end well at last, though I fear for you this evening." Ernest, true to his promise, came into the room of his friend as the bell rang five. "Time has lagged heavily, Ernest, yet I never dreaded so much the termination of a day. It is to bring with it the confirmation of all my hopes, or-- he shook his head mournfully, and rising slowly from his seat, with folded arms, and eyes resting upon the floor, paced the room, leaving the sentence unfinished. "Are you the bearer of any message?" at length he said. "None whatever, Gustavus. But Dr. Ostend was closetted with father a long time after his return." "I am then undone; there is but little hope of steering safely with Dr. Ostend at the helm. I can see breakers ahead, plainly. I thank you for this in- formation, Ernest, I shall be better prepared for the wreck of all my hopes." The sympathy of Ernest was most soothing to his friend. He endeavoured also to divert his thoughts into another channel, by giving him an account of his troubles at College, and the manner in which he had received his virtual dismissal. The clock struck seven. "Two hours since you came in. How wonderfully you have whiled away the time; you will take tea with me, Ernest?" "Certainly, I shall spend the evening with you."   /  ,HEIGHTS OF -EIDELBERG.     279 "CThank you. There is another subject on which I wish to speak with you; but as my tea-bell is ringing, I will defer it for the present." They sat down to a light repast; but the provisions stood almost untasted before them, and in a few mo- ments they returned to the room they had just left. "The question I wished to ask was this, Ernest: Are you engaged to Miss Meta Vance?" Ernest looked in perfect astonishment. "Miss Meta Vance! Do you ask it seriously?" "I do. Will you not answer me frankly?" "Most willingly. Miss Vance is a young lady in whom I never took the slightest interest. Of late I have been thrown with her accidentally, much against my will; but if it were even true," he observed, laugh- ing, "Miss Meta would surely now discard me, as she considers me such a heretic, that crosses and rosaries can hardly avail, against my contaminating pre- sence." "You relieve my mind greatly; let us now turn to some more interesting subject." As Gustavus finished speaking, Peter came to the door, and handed him a note. "Is an answered required, Peter?" "No, sir; the messenger went immediately away." "Is that the superscription of your father, Ernest?" asked Gustavus, as the man left the room. Ernest took the note from the hand of his friend; the seal was yet unbroken. ",It is, Gustavus,"' he replied.     280     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. The face of Mr. Weber became pale, and his hand trembled, as he broke the seal. The note was read, and handed to Ernest. "It is what I expected, Gustavus." "Compromise, indeed! It is worse than a down- right refusal. Could I only concede one point-that the Church of Rome is infallible! Dr. Ostend dictated that epistle; your father would not have offered me such an insult. Infallible!-That Confessor would be willing I should come with a lie in my right hand, and swear allegiance to his Church, when he is confident that it would only be to subserve worldly purposes, and render me entirely unworthy of her who is above all guile. No, no! Far better go with sorrow to the grave, than for a moment to listen to such proposals." "What will be your course, Gustavus?" "Baron Vancleve has placed his signature upon it; I must receive it as his decision. I shall not notice it." "Is there not a want'of respect in that procedure?" "Then be the bearer of a message,. Ernest. Say to him, that anything touching my conscience is dearer to me than life; and that he would be far from a faithful parent, if he would entrust his daughter to one who could be so base as to accede to such pro- posals." "I will be the medium," replied Ernest; "and shall also add my own comments, not altogether flat- tering to the ear of Dr. Ostend, if, as I believe his   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     281 custom is, to be opportunely nearer than others desire. I will see you again before bedtime." So saying, he hurried away, ere Gustavus had a moment's time to beg him to be judicious. As he entered the house, and went toward the library in search of his father, he heard the voice of Dr. Ostend, who was standing at the door, about taking leave. His attention was arrested by these words: "Let not your finer feelings be wrought upon, my son, to rise beyond your judgment in a matter of such vital importance. Let not the spotless escutcheon of this house be tarnished by such an alli- ance. It would bring a blight upon your household, place the soul of our dear young daughter in immi- nent jeopardy, and confirm Ernest in those principles with which he is now sorely tinctured. Better, far better, she should find a grave, if even an early one, in peace, than entail such temporal and everlasting misery on this noble house." "You are my reverend and spiritual father, and I trust you will guide me aright," replied the Baron, "but I confess that note seems trifling with Mr. Weber." "You do not know Mr. Weber, my son, as I know him; he is a member of every heretical society in Eidelberg-Tract, Bible, Home and Foreign Missions, all receive his aid. In the spread of his heretical. tenets he never tires, and is so bold withal, denouncing the true faith everywhere. Depend on it, Baron Vancleve, he is a wolf in sheep's clothing, and has     NU 282     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERa. the mark of the beast plainly written upon him. The day will come, sir, when you will rejoice that you per- mitted no tie to be formed with such a heretic." "Dr. Ostend," said Ernest, stepping forward, "your last words were accidentally heard by me; allow me to disabuse your mind in regard to Mr. Weber. The Bible says, 'By our fruits we shall be known.' Put your finger on one act of Mr. Weber's life that is not thoroughly Christian. He feeds the hungry, clothes the naked, and makes the heart of the widow and orphan sing for joy; he spends every cent of a large income in benevolence, leaving a scanty portion for himself. Yet he places no reliance on'his own merits, and trusts simply to the Cross for salva- tion. A union with him, Dr. Ostend, would be an honour and a blessing to any family." A slight confusion was at first apparent, when Father Antoine was thus suddenly addressed, but it was momentary, and his countenance assumed a look of stern defiance while Ernest was speaking. "Ernest Vancleve," he replied, as he finished, once a true, faithful son of the Church, a favoured follower of the immaculate Virgin, now sadly deluded, and wandering from the only faith that can lead to any thing but misery and everlasting death, I counsel you to beware of such deceivers as Gustavus Weber. Return yourself to us before it is too late; drive us not to proclaim that doom of all heretics, 'Let him be anathema, tnaranatha.'"  Ernest smiled--"Do your worst, Dr. Ostend; I   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     283 fear little the power of man; my foundation is a Rock that is immovable." Bowing low as he finished speaking, he turned, and went into the library. Baron Vancleve, after seeing Dr. Ostend to the door, joined him. "My son," said he, bitterly, "do you add contempt to the sin of apostasy?" "Contempt for whom, father?" "For my Confessor-for the Church which I love and venerate." "To the Church, father, I have made no allusion. On that point, you have most kindly allowed me the freedom ': my own will, at' present; for Dr. Ostend, I have the most profound, thorough contempt, be- lieving him one of the worst of men." "Ernest!"  "Nay, listen to me Father; you are indeed blinded toward him, but if you knew his deeds as I know them, you would scorn him as I do. I know but one man equal to him in villany-that is Dr. Basil Weisse." "Leave me, Ernest," replied his father, "you have  suffered yourself to be misled into strange thoughts of these holy men. Leave me; say nothing more; and say to John that I do not wish to be disturbed this evening. I would be left entirely alone." Ernest looked anxiously at his father, and would have spoken, but a decided "Go, my son," arrested him, and, with a heavy heart, he closed the door, /     284     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. and giving the servant his father's order, repaired to the room of his friend. Gustavus looked inquiringly as he entered. The countenance of Ernest told his mission had been un- successful. Seating .mself beside the table, he rested his head upon his hand, and remained silent. "You have not succeeded as you wished, Ernest," Gustavus at length remarked, "of that I am quite confident." "There will always be a blight upon our house," said Ernest, "while such men as Dr. Ostend are al- lowed to have the supremacy. The dominion he has gained seems to be invincible."' "The Lord reigns, Ernest, he is all power, all goodness, all love. During your absence, he has vouchsafed to hear my prayer. Jesus is my friend, and your friend, Ernest; our solace, our hope, our rock, our strong deliverer, our great high priest. He can be touched with a feeling of our infirmities. He has said, 'Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest.' I have gone to him with my burden of sorrows, and have found that promised rest. My mountain stands strong in the Lord, and I have again found peace in believing. Now tell me all; I am much more able to bear it than when you left me. Did you see your father?" ' "I did, in company with Dr. Ostend. I need say no more. In my excitement, I perhaps said more than was quite prudent, before my address was de- livered, and my diploma presented. I scorned his   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     285 threatened maledictions, and afterwards plainly told my father I knew him to be a villain." "I am glad you did -so, Ernest, it is time he was unmasked. But did he give it credit?" "I cannot tell; that the future only will reveal. But it is eleven o'clock, I must leave you. Pray for me, Gustavus, I need your prayers; my mind is only intent on revenge. Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to expose the deeds of those two hypo- crites."  "Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord," replied Gus- tavus, solemnly. "I will endeavour to obtain your spirit, by the same means, Gustavus." Bidding his friend a hasty good night, he left the room, and in a short time was closely locked in his own chamber. On entering the breakfast-room on the following morning, Ernest was startled at'the pale and haggard appearance of his father. There was a settled melan- choly upon his countenance, and to any questions, he only answered in monosyllables. As soon as the meal was over, he retired to the library. "Papa is not well," observed Adele, "I am sure something must be troubling him." "I must see him before H go to school," said Ernest; "I cannot leave him in such a dejected state." A tap at the door was answered by a "' Come in," and Ernest entered. 25     286     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "Pardon my intrusion, father, as you seemed to wish to be alone; but I desired much to know whe- ther you had examined, fully into the laws by which our College is regulated." I have done so; their charter would be forfeited if any were expelled, excepting for immoral conduct. Our government of course protects all denominations, and your apostasy could not be brought under the head of immorality." "Thank you, father," said Ernest, placing his hand upon that of his father, as it lay upon the table; "you leave nothing undone for me that would add to my happiness." "Was my kindness to my son well requited last evening?" asked the Baron. "I spoke from the fulness of my heart, father. I do not think it was unadvisedly; but if a word or look had even the appearance of unkindness or disrespect to you, let all my former conduct to my father answer, that it was unintentional." "To myself I had no reference, Ernest; much as I should feel it, that would be little, in comparison with the one you almost personally insulted, and afterwards openly reviled." Notwithstanding all the efforts of Ernest to be cool, his whole face was suffused with indignation. "He has been my tutor too long, father." Baron Vancleve interrupted him: "Ernest, the name of Father Antoine I hold as sacred; unless spoken with reverence, in my presence let it never be   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     287 mentioned. He is a most injured man, as well as Father Basil. The hour for your school has arrived Ernest; I hear the College bell."  "I leave you, father. But will you not even ponder our conversation of last night; make some inquiry, and see whether I have not ground for my accusation?" "It would avail nothing; appearances are often deceptive, and men, so uninitiated in the world's arti- fices, would very probably lay themselves open to the lips of calumny and falsehood." "My own personal observations ought not to be distrusted," he replied; " but the day will come when their deeds must be made manifest, even to my father." Not awaiting a reply, he hastened to school, as the bell had already ceased ringing. Scarcely had Ernest left the house, ere the door- bell rang, and Dr. Vance was announced. "Show him into the drawing-room," said the Baron  "in a few moments I will be with him. What can be his business at this unseemly hour?" he remarked to Lady Vancleve, who had joined him in the library. "'My mind has become so perplexed, that even an early visit from a friend startles me." "It must be on business at this hour, as his lecture would preclude visiting." The manner of Professor Vance appeared rather embarrassed, as he arose to receive his friend. "You will of course guess the purport of my visit, Baron Vancleve-the settlement of our children-yet     288     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. my situation is rather a novel one. The addresses of Ernest, as of course you know, have been accepted by Meta; but my consent to this union has npt yet been asked. The heretical sentiments which Ernest has imbibed, probably induces a delicacy on his part; but I have such confidence in the strength of Meta's faith, that she cannot be moved-and it is with the entire approval of our two confessors that I give my con- sent." The look of astonishment that met his view, as he raised his eyes toward the Baron, arrested him. "It is certainly the first intimation I have had of even my son's preference for Miss Vance, and his parents have always had his entire confidence. There must have been some misunderstanding, Dr. Vance." "Misunderstanding! Baron Vancleve, on such a subject!" "It is incomprehensible, I must confess," said the Baron, almost sick with the idea of such a sacrifice, which he only received with complacency when there was no prospect of the event. "I am sorry Ernest went so far without consulting any of us; perhaps he can give an explanation; if not, I shall at once withdraw my consent, whatever it may cost him.  My daughter could never be happy with one who deals deceitfully." "We will await the elucidation of Ernest, if you please," said the Baron, coldly. "This evening we will wait upon you together."   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     289 "At five this evening I will be ins my study at my house."  "At that hour we will endeavour to see you, sir." The Doctor took leave, and Baron Vancleve re- turned to the library. Lady Vancleve was exceedingly astonished to hear the purport of the visit. She had perfect confidence in Ernest, yet when she heard his foot in the hall, advancing towards the library, her heart beat with trepidation lest there should be some truth in Dr. Vance's communication. How was it possible he could be deceived in such a matter? How could Meta have misunderstood? yet how could it be true? She had seen him with her frequently, and always as soon as civility would permit, he escaped from her society. Unable to endure her thoughts, she opened the door and met Ernest. "I have really beqn through a fiery. ordeal," said he, "but I succeeded in escaping withal.  Our Professors did their utmost to throw me back an- other year, by proposing questions so difficult, that I cannot imagine myself how I answered them, and their chagrin at my success was so apparent,: that all my classmates noticed it. Their countenances suffi- ciently expressed with whom they sympathized, and the scornful and indignant looks cast upon our Pro- fessors must have been very galling to them. I found the report of their treatment had spread though the whole school, for as I passed into another room, Hess Wintersteen pulled me by the sleeve. 25*     290     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "'Give the worst of them a flogging, Vancleve, by way of letting the others know what they may expect in future, and all of us, little and big, will back you. It will only be 'righteous indignation,' you know,' said he, with a queer shake of the head. "I cannot imagine where he got hold of the phrase. I passed on without answering him, fearing he might be detected and punished. I must make him an apology for my apparent want of gratitude, as it was spoken in great kindness. The conduct of the pre- ceptors was too mean, too contemptible." "It was dastardly!" exclaimed the Baron, forget- ing, in his indignation and sympathy for Ernest, his wonted reverence for the Holy Fathers, "and shall not pass unrebuked." A most grateful look from Ernest was his only reply. "But, my son," asked Lady Vancleve, "was there no exception? Did all the Professors forfeit, for the time, their title to Christians and to gentlemen?" "No, mother, Dr. Vance was even more affable than usual, complimenting me on every answer, and pronounced me in .every way qualified to leave the College with honour." "Had he any private motive for being so com- placent?" "None whatever, that I can imagine, mother; it seemed to be dictated by a kind heart, and a proper sense of justice."   HEIGHTS OF EJDELBERG.      291 "' Had he any reason to suppose that such an honourable person would ever be his son-in-law?" Ir, his son-in-law!.--Do you ask such a question seriously, mother?" "I do, with the utmost gravity, my son." ' Then I will answer you as gravely, mother. Be- lieve me ,much as I value domestic happiness, I would remain a Benedict for ever before I would be tied to such as 5Meta Vance." "Did you ever give her any reason to suppose you felt differently?" "Such a question from you, mother, wounds me deeply; but I assure you there never has been an- attention, or a wordi that Miss Meta, or her father, could possibly misconstrue." "Your word is enough, Ernest," replied his father, with an undefined feeling of relief; " but there has been some great mistake that must be rectified. Dr. Vance considers you engaged; Miss Meta is also under that impression. I have promised to accom- pany you to his study this evening to have matters understood.'  "I!--go to Dr. Vance's house on such an errand, father?-Never! If he wishes to be enlightened on the subject, I will be most happy to meet him in this library, or in his study at the College; but it-would be insulting Miss Vance, and sadly compromising my own dignity, to go for such a purpose to her house. You surely did not consider it, father, when you granted that request."     292     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "You are right, Ernest, I was hasty in making such a promise; I was taken by surprise, and did not fully weigh the matter. I will write a note, mention- ing your disavowal, and asking Dr. Vance to meet us at the College." The next day brought a note in answer from the Professor, saying, that a meeting would be entirely unnecessary; that he could not be too thankful his daughter had escaped an alliance with one capable of trifling with the affections of one so gentle and so con- fiding; but as he was happy to find she took the same view of the case as himself, he trusted she would soon forget the existence of such a person as Ernest Van- cleve, who might be assured the renewal of his ad- dresses would never be permitted. "In this case, as in many others coming under my own observation," he continued, "I have been shown the little confidence we can place in heretics; and I bless the Holy Mother, that she has prevented my daughter forming an alliance on which she could look down upon but with abhorrence." "What step do you intend taking, Ernest, in this most unpleasant affair?" "With your approbation, father, I will write a civil note to the Doctor, asking him at what time there could have been any misunderstanding on his part, or on that of Miss Vance, and assuring him that the first thought, on that subject, of any living being, has yet to pass my mind; and that, if he would look back, he might remember that I had never paid a visit to his   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      293 house; and had not my studies so fully occupied me, my youth would have made an alliance exceedingly absurd. I can then close with assurances of respect, &c. If the Doctor send no reply, I shall then con- sider myself exonerated." "That is just what I would advise," said Lady Vancleve; "and I confess I am relieved that Miss Meta Vance is not, at some future day, to take my name and title." A bright smile from her husband showed some agreement of sentiment, and Ernest, kissing his mo- ther, retired to his chamber to direct a few lines to Dr. Vance, ere he looked over the address which was to be delivered on the morrow. * CHAPTER X.

"T is fifteen minutes to ten, Carl," said Mr. Ra- venscroft, "at what time do your cousins expect you to meet them at the landing?" "At ten, father," replied Carl.

Margaret and Theresa have both come with me, Eldrid, I thought they would be needed these busy Christmas times. I therefore closed the house, and rejoiced their hearts by telling them they should spend their Christmas with Katrine." "The children will be delighted with that arrange- ment, as it will enable them to carry out their plans of furnishing a parlour for Katrine, without her know. ledge.' "Bas Annette taken any interest in the return of Elsie?" "'Judge for yourself, Meggy. With the expecta- tion of her return, she has gone to ride with Dr. Von. berg, giving as an excuse, that her anxiety to see her had produced headache, and she would, therefore, take a little fresh air for a few hours." "Does Elsie know he has declared himself?" asked his sister. "No, we thought it better to wait until she re- turned. She will hear it soon enough, poor child." "When will the marriage take place?" "About the first of March." "Dear, dear child," said Mrs. Vandoren with a deep sigh. A carriage coming up the avenue interrupted them, and the next moment the voices of the bright, laughing girls were heard. "It is delightful to leave home," said Cassy, "if it is only for the pleasure of returning." "The delight of returning home, I cannot gainsay,"   HEIGHTS OF EIDELmBE  O.     295* replied Elsie, kissing her aunt affectionately; abut uncle's house, with aunty Vandoren, is almost too sweet to leave, even for that pleasure." After a cordial welcome from all the servants, who came to greet them, they gathered round the, table in the study, to receive an account of all that had: oc- curred during their absence, of which they had not been informed by letter, " O!" exclaimed Elsie, sud- denly remembering-"Mamma, where is mamma?" There was a smile, mingled with a painful expres- sion on the countenance of Mrs. Vandoren, as she answered, "she said she felt unwell, and is taking a little fresh air. She will soon be here." Elsie looked perfectly satisfied, and Cassy continued her inquiries for those in whom she was interested. 'What of Ernest Vancleve, Carl? Did he suc- ceed in leaving College- with honour, notwithstanding the efforts of the Professors to prevent him?" "He did, Cassy, and made one of the finest speeches ever heard among us. 'Oscar Weimar told me the only defect in his oratory was, that his manner was too grave, and his discourse was evidently altered, to avoid addressing either the President or Professors. When taking leave, you know, it is always customary to shake hands with every Professor, and receive a kind word from each. Instead of this, as he finished speaking, he turned, and facing the whole body, bowed low and respeetfully, but in the most distant manner, and immediately left the platform. His own class gathered closely around him, -and-their warim     296     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. congratulations brought a scowl on the countenances of the august gentlemen. Even Dr. Vance, who had before been so complacent, looked dark as Erebus. The applause would have been general; but those who expected still to remain were restrained by fear of a dismissals I have invited him and Gustavus Weber to dine with us to-morrow. Ernest wishes to see you privately, father, for a little while; his busi- ness is, I rather think, to ask you to permit him to study theology one year with you. He hopes then to go to one of the Seminaries for two years; it will entirely depend on the health of his sister, as he will not leave her in her delicate state." "Very well, my son; I have put aside all my own business for a day or two, purposely to enjoy you little folks, and am entirely at the service of one or all of you." "Here comet mamma," said Elsie, "up the avenue, and Dr. Vonberg,with her; I had almost forgotten him."  She walked slowly fo the door to meet them. "My darling child," said Mrs. Ravenscroft, throw- ing her arms around the neck of Elsie, "how anx. iously I have awaited your return; so anxiously, that I feared a nervous attack, but hope I have ridden off the alarming symptoms. Your old friend, Dr. Von- berg, Elsie." Elsie extended her hand in a cordial manner to him; but was filled with surprise and vexation, when he drew her towards him in the most familiar manner, and kissed her cheek.   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      297, Drawing back, haughtily, the blood mounted to her very temples; and hastily returning to the parlour, she seated herself between her aunt and Cassy. The President took his leave. Mrs. Ravenscroft; darting a look of anger at her daughter, went immediately up stairs. "t By what right does Dr. Yonberg take such liber- ties with me?" said she, when she was sufficiently calm to speak-- In future I shall carefully avoid him." "He felt privileged from his intimacy with your mother, my dear/' replied Mrs. Vandoren; and looked upon you, also, as a child." "No intimacy with another would warrant such im- pertinence, aunt Meggy." As she said this, her mother entered, still looking much angered at the reception the President had received. "Of whom are you speaking so freely, Elsie?" she asked. "Of Dr. Vonberg, mother," was the reply. "Do you know the position you occupy in regard to him?" "I suppose you allude to his kindness during my sickness." ( That was the origin of my kind feeling toward him, and I feel I could not do better for my child"' than give him a parent's right to guide her." Elsie sprang from her seat, and stood immediately 26     298     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. before her mother. Several times she attempted to speak, but passion prevented her utterance. "What does this mean?" asked her mother, in a tone of defiance; "you will find that Dr. Vonberg and I have wills that will hardly succumb to a spoiled, disobedient child. When we have the entire guidance, with none to thwart us in our plans, you will be a very different child." "No doubt he will exercise dominion over you, Mrs. Ravenscroft," replied Elsie, when at length able to speak, "for you are not my mother, and never acted a mother's part. As to me, this is my home, and will ever be, while uncle Ravenscroft lives. Will you not receive me as your daughter, uncle?" she asked, placing her arms tightly round his neck, and sobbing bitterly. Returning her caress warmly, he whispered, "Be calm, Elsie, all will be right." "You are my daughter," said Mrs. Ravenscroft, "and none can break the tie, or take away my right to govern. You remove to the house of Dr. Vonberg with me." "On that subject, Annette, I, as her guardian, will interfere. Elsie shall be left to her unbiassed choice." The arm of Elsie was clasped more closely round the neck of her uncle, as she seated herself upon his knee, and laid her head upon his shoulder. Her sobs ceased, and she became perfectly calm. "Eldrid, you are threatening what you have no power to put in execution." *   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     299 "Possession is nine points in the law, mother," re- plied Elsie, with a provoking look, almost amounting to a smile, and that I give to uncle in fee simple." Carl, whose eye had been fixed on Elsie during the whole transaction, now arose, and going to her, said in a low voice, "Whom  do you profess to follow, Elsie?" No electric shock could have thrilled her as those few words. She sought in vain to catch the eye of her cousin; he slowly paced the floor without again noticing her. Her arm relaxed from the firm grasp it had taken of her uncle, and rising, she seated herself in a chair somewhat nearer her mother. For a long time she seemed irresolute, then, with a great effort, she whispered, rather than said, "If I have spoken unadvisedly, mother, I ask your forgiveness." "If!" replied her mother, scornfully--"Is there any doubt of it? Did I ever know you otherwise than a disobedient, wayward, spoiled, impertinent child?" Again the crimson mounted to her face, and again a look from Carl arrested her-"I will endeavour to do differently, mother." "Sight would be much stronger with me than faith in your good behaviour," she coolly replied. "When in my own house, or rather in that of Dr. Vonberg, respectful or disrespectful treatment will not be left to your own choice; that will be regulated byus." "If you mean by that threat," replied Elsie, now driven almost to frenzy, and forgetting all the admo-     300     HEIGHTS OF EIDErBERG. nitions of her cousin, that I will be ruled by the same laws which govern an automaton, you will be mistaken. I defy both you and President Vonberg. Before I submit to either, I will beg my food at the door of beggars, or work day and night to obtain a livelihood-No! I would-" Carl gently took her hand, and led her from the room, saying, in a low voice, "You will regret this, Elsie." Mrs. Ravenscroft left the study almost immediately, shutting the door violently behind her. In about an hour Elsie returned, with swollen eyes, as though she had been weeping, and seating herself beside Mr. Ravenscroft, said, "I have given way to temptation, uncle; I feel that I have done wrong-I went up stairs to tell mamma so-but it requires a great deal of Christian patience, dear uncle, to be mamma's daughter." "With the temptation God always makes a way of escape, Elsie; but if you give way to your own evil heart, you will grieve the Spirit of God, and bring great darkness on your own soul." "I know it-I know it; I trust I may hereafter be able to overcome my angry feelings at mamma. If I only were cousin Carl's or Cassy's sister, or any one rather than myself, I should be a better girl; but the very sight of mamma seems to have a bad effect upon me; I sometimes am afraid she will make me lose my soul. Pray for me, dear uncle, and I will try to do very differently."   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      8 01 Dear child," replied her uncle, kissing her, "you have many, many trials, but mercies also, Elsie. You forget how many kind friends are waiting anxiously to see you. Dr. Baden came twice yesterday to know whether his renegades had come yet." "Dr. Baden!" exclaimed Elsie, called at once from her own troubles, "does he remember me so kindly?-I am sure I don't deserve it." "And there has been an express from Lady Van- cleve, inviting you to spend a few days with them." "That will be delightful-shall we go, uncle?" "Certainly; I see nothing to prevent it. Ernest and Mr. Weber dine with us to-morrow, for the ex- -press purpose of escorting your ladyships to see the Africanus before Captain Blucher sails. Then comes the pleasure of furnishing Katrine's room." "And I propose," said Cassy, "hanging up Carl's stocking, and putting all his presents in it." "Capital, coz, capital; that will be a good joke. How much pleasure we have in anticipation. A few moments since, I thought I was the most miserable of mortals." "If you would reflect, daughter," replied Mr. Ravenscroft, "when only the shadows of life are ap- parent, that you are still under the shadow of the Almighty. It often places a bow in the cloud, when you raise your eyes upward." "I will try, dear uncle, to follow your advice," replied Elsie, her eyes filling with tears, "and I will 26*     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.    303   try to remember that there never was a rose without a thorn." The next morning, Elsie, laying aside all care for the future, rose bright and happy, and towards the middle of the day, started with Miss Vandoren and the young gentlemen to visit the Africanus. They were received with a kind welcome by Captain Blu- cher, and were soon much interested in examining all the machinery of the vessel, which the Captain took great pleasure in explaining to them. "Here comes Hassinger," said Carl, "our old friend, who admires no language but his own, and is such a foe to Greek and Latin. I wonder how it is Alphonse comes to College." As Carl finished speaking, the old gentleman drew near. "We've got quite a company here this morning," he remarked. "Why! Carl and Ernest, my lads, happy to see you. Why! Cassy, how are you? And who may this young lady be?" "Don't you know me, Mr. Hassinger?" said Elsie, laughing, "I am Elsie Ravenscroft." "Elsie!-not little Elsie! Such a strapping lass as this! Well! what are babies coming to? Well, how are you getting on, Captain?-Off to-morrow?" "I see nothing now to prevent, sir." "I trust not. These delays are expensive matters. You see, young gentlemen, we thought all ready six weeks ago, but the hatchway was so constructed that it hurt the insurance, and had to be pulled all to   pieces-an extra expense, besides all the wharfage. It will take a good voyage and much economy prac- tised to yield a cent profit this year. More profit to Captain than owner, I'm thinking. You'll need something of an income in your new establishment, Blucher. Now my motto is--'A  penny saved is better than two-pence gained.' Yours seems to be, Two-pences are made to lavish. Elfin Heights is considerable of a house for a beginner." "I ask no more, sir, than that for which we bar- gained-of that I shall make what disposition I think proper." "Certainly, certainly," he replied, in a tone much modulated. "I only gave you a little warning; it's now off my shoulders." "The responsibility rests entirely with myself, sir." "True, true. Every one has a right to spend his own in the way he likes best." And looking a little confused, he quickly turned the subject. "Well, my lads, I suppose College days are almost over. Heads so stuffed with Greek and Latil, won't hold any more, eh? Good sound English all pushed out. Not the fashion now-a-days-no! no!  Now there's Alphonse, to be sure, worried my life and soul out, till he got to College; and what has he been good for since? Why, literally nothing.

I say it's worth more to him than all the 'ologys and trumperies in the world, that serve but to turn the best men's brains." "Well, but Mr. Hassinger," said Carl, when the old gentleman paused to recover a little breath, " whlt are you going to do with our young doctor here? Mr. Weber is stuffing for a doctor; accounts will help him but little in his profession." "Weber, Weber!" he repeated, coming a little closer to the group, and, taking a small eyeglass from his vest pocket, gave him a scrutinizing survey. "Weber!-that name is surely known to me. Yes, yes! Frederick Gustavus Weber, the intimate friend of young Vanbremer, bought more books in a year than ten men would read in an age; and took so little care of money, that if he hadn't had such a cargo of it, his children might have sung for a maintenance. Never increased it a cent, never; ready to be imposed upon by all the lackadaysical beggars that came in his way; always had a full hand with an empty pocket." Gustavus laughed heartily. "What College are you at, young man?" he asked. "The Medical, sir." "Yes, yes! But little or big pills; infinitesimal doses, or the good old system?" "I shall study both, and administer that which proves most beneficial." "You'll soon get tired of the trituration stuff-I   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      305 forget its name. My wife is a convert to it; always uses it in little or great cases. To be sure, a cure soon fol- lows; but I believe it is nature-that's the best and cheapest curative, after all. Good morning, gentle- men. I have five minutes still; it will take me that long to walk to Cobb & Company's counting-house." So saying, Mr. Hassinger took his leave; and the rest of the party, at the pressing invitation of Captain Blucher, promising often to see Mrs. Blucher during his absence, bade him farewell also, and returned to  the manse with good appetites and in high spirits, and separated in the evening with a promise from the ladies of a visit to the chateau on the morrow. This is a fine morning, cousin Carl," said Elsie; "we shall not be disappointed in our trip, but I will be quite troubled if Cassy has forgotten me." "Not the slightest danger," said Ernest, who at this moment made his appearance; " she is so anxious for her dear Miss Elsie, that she is gazing out of the window continually. I came to the landing to meet you; and 'not finding you there, I thought I would have the pleasure of crossing with you." Just as they reached the Eidelberg side, and came in sight of the porter's lodge, the attention of Ernest was attracted by Michael, who was running at full speed, and the two Master Oberlins flying before him. Pointing out the race, they watched on the shore, to see the result of the contest. Michael gained upon them rapidly, and soon succeeded in getting them within arm's length; seizing them by the collar, he     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.   307   shook them so lustily, that Ernest, thinking it neces- sary to interfere, advanced towards them, and reached the scene of action just as Michael, loosing his firm grasp, had tossed them headlong on the ground. "Michael, Michael!" shouted Ernest, "what are you about there, man?" Hearing the voice of his young master, Michael turned, showing a face that might well represent his hot-headed nation. "Sure, Misther Ernest, an they've splet in paces all the glass in the grane-house, the young varmints. To think the likes o' them to play me such a trick; I'll bate the very brains out on 'em, let 'em come nare me agin.", "Never mind, Michael," answered Ernest;. "they shall be punished, I promise you. Let us now see to procuring a glazier, before the air reaches the plants." "Glazier, indade! Jack Clopstock is gone away for the matther of four hull days, an by that time, I'm a thinkin', my roots will be starved wid the frost althe- gither; an jist all out of the deviltry of them young chaps." Those young chaps, however, kept at a very respect- ful distance from Michael; and it was not until they reached the house, that Ernest was able to overtake them. They were then going to elude him; but Ernest, seizing them by the hand, insisted on know- ing how the glass was broken. "It wasn't my fault, anyhow," said Oscar; "Lo- renzo dared me to it, and I wasn't going to be dared by any one, so I jumped on it; and then Michael was 4.   so mad, that, to make him madder, and see a little fun, Lorenzo jumped on it too, and broke the rest. We got the worst of it, anyhow; but we'll pay him up yet." "I will just put you into a safe retreat," said Ernest; "out of the way of doing any further mis- chief, until your uncle Lorenzo comes home." "Uncle Lorenzo! why he has gone out to dinner." "Well, the longer time you have to ponder your bad conduct, the better." By this time they had reached a small room in the back building; and notwithstanding all their efforts to escape, Ernest forced them in, and locked the door upon them. Their kicks and screams disturbed no one, as Ernest, anticipating this, had placed them in a remote part of the house. Lady Vancleve, not aware that anything had hap- pened, was pleasantly conversing with her guests in the drawing-room; and it was not until dinner time that the boys were missed. * "Tell the young gentlemen, John," said Lady Van- cleve, "to come immediately to dinner." "It's more than they can do, ma'am," he replied, grinning from ear to ear with delight, "till Mr. Ernest gives them leave." Lady Vancleve looked inquiringly. Ernest smiled. "In father's absence, I have de. puted myself their guardian, and have put them in a place of safety until his return." The story was then told, and his mother, highly     308     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. approving of all that was done, prepared some dinner, and told John to carry it to them. In a few moments he came back, telling them the room was vacated. On examination, a sheet was found tied to the turn- buckle, by the aid of which, they had effected their escape. A small strip of soiled paper lay upon the table, on which was written with a lead pencil. "We are going home; we know the stages, and by ten o'clock to night will reach there; we will not stay to be abused." "The best disposition of themselves possible," said Ernest. "It is a perfectly straight route to Brasburg, and there is no necessity for the slightest uneasiness. What do you say, mother, to a visit to Mrs. Blucher." "Not this afternoon, my son, I shall feel anxious until we hear from the boys. But, with her fur cloak, I do not think Adele will take any cold. The car- riage is close and comfortable." The ladies were soon equipped, and the party, accompanied by the delighted little Gassy, were in a few moments winding around Elfin Heights, and soon alighted at the door of Captain Blucher. They were received with the kindest welcome by Mrs. Blucher, and made a very pleasant visit of an hour. As they returned, Gassy remarked, "The house is not so large as you are led to suppose, on coming towards it; it is so tastefully arranged, that even the size is deceptive." "I do not want you to think Captaim er ex- travagant," said Ernest, "and will tei&;eli you   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      309 that he only gives my father three hundred rix tha- lers for the house, and will continue to stand at that rent until he has realized something." "The furniture is perfectly plain," remarked Carl, cand Captain Blucher told me he intended furnish- ing only one chamber at present, as he would not ex- ceed the five hundred thalers loaned him by Dr. Baden, and the small sum he had on hand. But I must tell you an anecdote of his generosity to others. He released Captain Horn from his indebtedness to him, as soon as he obtained the command of the Africanus, and left him the old furniture of his house, with the exception of some articles of intrinsic worth." "Dear Miss Elsie," said little Cassy, as she seated herself in her lap, after their return, "I think you are the very nicest young lady in all the world." "Little Cassy has some penetration," said Ernest, as his mother repeated Miss Cassy's decided opinion, "there is a witchery about her, which few possess." These few impressive words were noted upon the tablet of Lady Vancleve's memory, and an agreeable impression remained long after the subject of it had returned to her studies at St. Lucia. The vacation passed pleasantly and speedily; the little parlour was furnished for Katrine, giving even more delight than was anticipated; and Galen's old mother nicely fixed in a tenement belonging to Mr. Ravenscroft, and not many yards from the kitchen building, where little Galen could peep in at his dear 27     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.   381   mother every hour of the day, and often bore a mes- sage from the kind-hearted Katrine, inviting her to come in and partake of a portion of her meal. But the Christmas days were ended, and the time had arrived to set out for St. Lucia. Mrs. Ravenscroft, on taking leave, with great dignity informed Elsie that her presence would not be required on the first of March, but during her vacations her home would be at Cora Heights. Elsie's look of pleasure could scarcely be restrained at so unexpected a reprieve; "and her leave-taking," Cassy said, " was almost not cold." Time went on, waiting for none, and soon the bells rang merrily a wedding peal, seeming in mockery of the feelings of the house of Ravenscroft, as by this union they felt the immortal soul of one was jeopard- ized, and the happiness of another member sadly marred; but the bells rang nevertheless, and the bride and groom, accompanied, not by Mr. Ravenscroft, who could not conscientiously see the marriage cere- mony, as a sacrament, but by Mrs. Vandoren, Carl, Baron and Lady Vancleve, and the greater part of the title# families, far and near, to whom was given a splendid dinner at the new mansion of President Von- berg. Mrs. Vandoren made her arrangements to live with her brother during the two years that Cassy expected still to remain at school. Two years!-a long time as we look into the future, but, as the days and the months roll on so swiftly, we   can, as they pass away, in the words of the poet, re- cord them as "Gone with the world before the flood." The two years have indeed sped away, bringing but little change with them. Elsie's home, during vaca- tion, was nominally with her mother, but she was generally among her friends. Ernest was still reading in Mr. Ravenscroft's study, as his sister was so exceedingly frail that he felt un- willing to separate, himself from her. Carl, and his friend Mr. Weber, attended the medical school toge- ther, but the latter was about finishing his third course. "To-day I must leave you early, Gustavus," said Carl, as they came out of the College arm in arm. My cousins return home this morning, and I am very anxious to get a peep at them." Gustavus sighed deeply, but said nothing. "Next week the lectures close," continued Carl; my father desires you will spend some time with us before you return home." "Home!" repeated Gustavus, bitterly-" that name is known to me only in the remembrance. In review- ing the past, it is a name fraught with the sweetest recollections-as to the future, time only will reveal whether it will be my favoured lot to have what I can call a home. When I will return to the chateau, is uncertain. My duty calls me to my peasantry; but can I leave all I hold dear here?-yet if I remain, what is my hope?"

"My position with the Vancleve family is a strange one, Carl. Ernest is my most intimate friend, except- ing yourself. Baron Vancleve has visited me twice a week, since I saved the life of little Cassy; and almost daily, when the weather is fair, she is sent with Ber- tha, to while away a leisure hour for mne, and her visits afford me the greatest pleasure. Lady Vancleve has several times called with her husband, speeks freely of our relative positions, and mourns deeply the dif- ference of religion, the only, but insurmountable, obstacle to our happiness." "But Gustavus," replied Carl, "I am surprised that, under any circumstances, you give way to such morbid feelings. Your mountain, surely, stands strong in the Lord." "The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak, my friend. Though I fear I often say with Jonah, 'I do well to be angry with the gourd.' I confess I felt to-day I was ungrateful for my many blessings, when I received a letter from poor Lewellyn Bryant. He is about leaving the Heidelberg school, has declared himself a Protestant, and has been discarded, and cast upon the world by his father, without one cent. I have invited him to take up his abode, at once, at the chateau, and await my return. I have one of the best of housekeepers, and he will find every thing very comfortable." "Misther Carl," said Michael, coming quickly up the rock, where the two friends had seated them- selves, and doffing his wool cap as he spoke, "I   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     313. would'nt be interruptin' of you's, but your man Ber- trand has been a looking for you's this full half hour, an plaze you." "Thank you, Michael," said Carl, "tell him I will be with him presently." Taking a kind leave of his friend, and obtaining a promise that he would dine with him on the morrow, he was soon seated beside Bertrand, in his little Sea Bird, and rowing rapidly in the direction of Eisel- dorf. CHAPTER XII. "Joy is not in your path, for it loveth not that bleak, broad road." "Now my school education is finished, uncle Eldrid," said Elsie Ravenscroft, "I wish I could live with you, I should, so much benefit by your instructions, and this is such a happy home." A shade of anxiety crept. over the face of her uncle as he answered, "Our happiness, my daughter, depends greatly on the state of our own hearts, and we must try to be contented with whatsoever situation Providence has assigned us; and,' laying his hand affectionately on her head, as he kissed her, he added, "patiently submit to the will of Heaven, who directs your destiny; there may be much good in store for you, Elsie, daughter." 27*     314     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "O, that I had been your real daughter, uncle, and Carl's own sister!" "First cousins are arbitrary articles, Elsie," said Carl, "you are not the only one I would I could con- vert into my father's daughter." Mrs. Vandoren alone understood his allusion. Elsie replied, "I would as soon be aunt Meggie's daughter as your sister, Carl, all I desire is to live among you, and share your happiness." "And add to it, too, dear," said aunt Meggie; " per. haps some arrangements can be made with your mother, to leave you with us certain portions of the year." Elsie shook her head doubtingly. "Do you intend walking to Dr. Baden's, coz?" she inquired. "Yes, and ride back, if you will lend me Noble." "I will walk up the hill with you, if you will lead him." She was soon equipped; taking a sad leave of them, she passed into the kitchen to say farewell there also. Katrine followed her to the gate, where Carl and the pony patiently awaited her. The old woman stood a long while looking after her darling, and several times the corner of her apron was carried to her eyes before she returned to the house. "There was more on your mind, my sister-cousin, than you cared to divulge this morning," said Carl, when about half way up "Heavy Slope." Elsie burst into tears. "Not a 'tempest' already with Dr. Vonberg; you   HEIGHTS OP EIDELBERG.      815 have been but three days from school; but perhaps you would rather not tell me why you are so distressed." "No, no, my thoughts have always and shall always be yours, cousin; the matter is just this-mamma insists on my calling Dr. Vonberg 'father,' and is very angry, as well as himself, that I do not; can it be expected Carl?" "Certainly; and you are all wrong, Elsie. The position he has asumed, or rather that your mother has given him, entitles him to the name, and you have no right to withhold it. He has been uniformly kind to you, Elsie?" "O yes, but his very kindness is oppressive. I hold still as an automaton when he chooses to caress me, because you were so shocked at my non-compli- ance." She said, laughing through her tears, "Must I apologize for my conduct in this instance too, Carl?" "I think that unnecessary. Your yielding the point is all that is requisite." "If I had you always to counsel me at the very minute, I should escape so much, dear coz." "Our Book tells us, as far as it is possible to live in peace with all men; and that cannot be done, Elsie dear, if we only reach forward towards the selfish attainment of our own ends."  They had reached the brow of the 'Slope," and were enjoying the beauty of the prospect, when Dr. Vonberg, seeing them from the verandah, came forward, arrayed in a. remarkably gaudy morning gown, to meet them.     316     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "Good morning, Carl; good morning, Elsie daugh- ter; you were truant from breakfast, have you enjoyed your ramble?" Carl returned the salutation very graciously. Elsie replied, "I rode over and walked back, my head is better"-she met a penetrating glance-" thank you, father." The eye turned approvingly, Elsie was satisfied. "Your aunt Annette will be much disappointed if you pass by, Carl." "I have only a moment, Doctor," was the reply as they all entered the house. "Is not my father your uncle?" whispered Elsie, archly. "I cannot even sit down, aunt Annette," said Carl, taking her extended hand, "Elsie and I have loitered on the 'Slope,' and Dr. Baden requires me. It is very pleasant, perhaps you and uncle Ferdinand will ride over in the course of the day." "We will," answered the surprised and delighted President. "I have a few slips of some very rare plants, I hope you will give them a place in your garden, Carl." "Very gladly," he replied, "but good-by now. As I return, aunt Annette, may I take Elsie home to spend a few days?" "I know no objection, I dare say she will make none, although I do think she might have some desire to be with her mother the first week of her return.' '"Suppose I go next week, coz."   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG,     317 "I think it pretty positive I would do much for Elsie when I call him uncle" muttered Carl, swing- ing back the garden gate of "Cora's Chateau." The visit was duly made, the slips duly planted, acknowledgments for them duly paid, and the day passed away much more pleasantly than the morning tokened. "Troulles again, my fair cousin," said Carl, going forward to help Elsie from Noble, "that countenance expresses more indignation than I love to see." "Come over with me to Point Rock, Carl, I need counsel and sympathy." "Of both quite certain, Elsie; but tell me the troubles, I am sure they will be as soon dissipated." "This book with this note I found on my bureau this morning, in the place of my Bible; I suppose Dr. Vonberg hoped the bright exterior would com- pensate for any pleasure I might have taken in the perusal of my plain one." Carl read thenote. "At some future period, perhaps not in 'Time,' my daughter Elsie will acknowledge me her true friend, in having dispossessed her of the volume which is of no private interpretation, and in affording her the precious opportunity of becoming acquainted with the doctrines and blessed truths of the Church of her mother's ancestry. Her anxious and affectionate Father,                F. V "My first impulse, Elsie," said Carl, as he folded         .     318     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. the billet, is to send the book into the stream, and his note to bear it company, but that would be impo- litic; now promise me you will never read one word in it, but let it remain for ever clasped with his note in it." "I never meant to, I promise you, Carl." "I am satisfied so far dear, but we must weigh our words narrowly, this is indeed the beginning of trou- bles." "O! Carl, what will become of me?" said the poor girl, bursting into tears. "Be doomed to despair, and I with you, my own Elsie, but for the unfailing promises contained in the Bible, which Vonberg has not power to shut from you. 'I am with you alway, even unto the end,' said the Lord Jesus; and again, 'with every temptation I will make a way of escape;' such, and many similar, you can make your own, Elsie." She covered her face with her hands, and laid her head on his knee, he bowed his over it and prayed for her. O! how fer- vently. Elsie lifted up her face, and wiped away her tears. "I feel calmer, cousin Carl; shall I ask Dr. Vonberg to return me my Bible?" "He would not if you did, Elsie, no; I am driven to instruct you in scheming and concealment; a Bible could not be hidden, therefore you must be satisfied with only one leaf; that, you must commit to memory, ponder its truths, lay them to heart prayerfully, then return it to me, I will scatter it where the ,       .   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     319 wayfarer possibly may be benefitted by it, and provide you with another; this stratagem no one will suspect, it is only stern necessity induces this deception, you and I would scorn it else." "Why, Carl, you know we would never have had the Scriptures all, had they not been hidden for us." "I am not regarding what we are doing wrong, Elsie, but I always did despise the very appearance of deceit." "May I not refuse to be present at morning prayers? I tried being too late, but Father Antoine has changed the hour for my accommodation." "Father Antoine! do you expect me to uncle him, Elsie?" "No," she replied with an hysteric laugh; "but as all the servants, mamma, all the visitors, every person, calls him Father Antoine, it seemed to come natur- ally, just as the white people on the Western Conti- nent call all the blacks, uncle, aunt and mammy." Carl laughed outright, Elsie looked disconcerted. "That is a very ignoramus version of the Yankees; too many Americans have visited our country, and introduced some of their most excellent customs, and induced the abolishing of no few of our very unwise practices, to believe they have such absurdities among them; among some of the very southern United States, the negro slaves to whom they become greatly attach- ed they designate by these familiar titles. I guess it will not be 'for this reason you will father Dr. Os. tend."     320     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERGO "But is it not the wisest policy to secure peace, cousin?" "No, dear, it is admitting that he is a spiritual guide, one advance toward Papacy. As a Protestant, with you he must be Dr. Ostend. Never yield one ace in principle to secure harmony; submit to your mother's control, even though she infringe greatly on your personal comforts, Elsie; remember the Chris- tian character is to be sustained, and sustained, my sweet Elsie, independent of the 'olive stick;' it will not be at hand to twine up the wayward tendrils. But do not look so sadly, Elsie, if you outlive these an- noyances, in two years and nine months you will be de- livered from them all. During that period you will be compelled to conform to your mother's wishes; you will be expected to attend, and your presence required at their private worship; you dare not refuse, therefore better submit cheerfully. No doubt stringent methods will be adopted to proselyte you to the Papacy; books, to convince you of the horrors of Protestantism will be opened to you; the efficacy of a confessional will be presented to you most alluringly-on this, and their books, place your foot firmly, and keep it there; my Elsie, my sister-cousin. At the close of these petty persecutions, the manse of the Dominie, or the chateau Vancleve, will gladly welcome you to a per- manently happy home." Elsie started, coloured slightly, and asked, "Did aunt Meggy tell you about it, Carl?" "No, Elsie, I charged Ernest Vancleve with pur-   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     321 loining half of my 'birth-right;' he with great assur- ance owned to the robbery, but I will be quite con- tented if you will tell me you have quid pro guo." "No denying the truth, yet I would be sorry to suppose I belonged one jot less to you." "I shall not dispute the claim," said her cousin, laughing, "until the two years and nine months have expired. Sister-cousins are slippery possessions." "I shall be eighteen; the intervening time seems long. I doubt Miss Adele Vancleve will be living; how much I do admire her, Carl." "Lady Vancleve and Adele are both very lovely, and are much attached to you, Elsie; and as to Cassy, though only five,.she has the information of an or- dinary girl of ten years of age." "Ernest taught her," said Elsie, eagerly. There was a very funny smile met her eye. She laughed, and said a little reproachfully, "I do not think I could put a higher estimate on Ernest Vancleve's character than yourself, Carl; it was your opinion of him, and affection for him, that gave him so much weight with me." "And I would be the last to lessen it, Elsie. I do not believe there. is his superior breathing, and if he were not just what he is, he would be unworthy of my guileless cousin; it is unspeakably comforting to me, Elsie, to look beyond the ordeal through which I am well aware you are to pass, to that measure of as perfect happiness as this world can possibly offer; and 28     322     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. it will enable you most assuredly to suffer far more cheerfully, knowing there is a limit." "Of course, Carl, and it is so gratifying to me that the Vancleves are as well satisfied with the con- nection as uncle's family." "Mrs. Vancleye used the word delighted," said Carl, laughing again. "If you are, I think I may be satisfied with their appreciation of me. I spent yesterday there, at Miss Adele's urgent request; she was indisposed. I felt perfectly at home, Carl; on coming away, Baron Van- cleve kissed me so kindly." "Kissed you!" interrupted Carl, "that was the ever-to-be-remembered crime of President Vonberg, which caused so much wrath between you and aunt Annette; how did your dignity endure it?" "Be quiet, Carl, you know 1 apologized to Dr- Vonberg; but Baron Vancleve is so fatherly." "I thought that was the principal objection to the other," interrupted Carl again. "They are so different-I really love Baron Van- cleve; 1 do not dislike Dr. Vonberg, but somehow he makes such a parade of his affection. Baron Van- cleve has more heart I am sure." "A nobler heart never beat, Elsie. When Baron Vancleve kissed you, and called you daughter, he took you right into that heart as a member of his own family, and he will never fail you in the hour of need; you could not have a better friend, and he has   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERGO,     323 powerful influence." Carl arose as he finished, and looked at his watch. "Carl, uncle Eldrid invited Ernest to dinner to- day, with Dr. Stuyvezant, shall we walk over the bridge to meet him?" "No, look up the stream." "It is the Dolphin; how prettily she dips, but Er-  nest says you are better on the oar." "He thinks so, but I am not." Ernest drew the boat close up to the rock, and after the usual greetings, Carl said, "I will be much obliged to you, Vancleve, if you will take this young lady a' turn round the Bay, it will be serviceable to her pale cheeks to apply a little of nature's rouge, sure to be found there." "Thank you, Carl," said Ernest, as hfe helped Elsie into the boat, "will you accompany us?" "I am afraid I should not receive such a well- fitting 'thank you' if I did." He darted to the top of the rock to escape a calabash of water which Ernest was preparing as a reward. Turning at the summit, he waved his hat in triumph. Ernest flourished his gourd in return, and it gladdened the heart of Carl to hear the merry laugh of Elsie, as the boat glided under the cliff, toward the Bay. The family had retired to rest that night, leaving Mrs. Vandoren with Carl, discussing the comparative and relative merits of the Professors of the College, to which the very agreeable visit of Dr. Stuyvezant had given rise. "The President does enjoy coming !'     324     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. here," said Carl, "but we shall lose him soon, he is to pass the summer vacation with Gustavus Weber." "I suppose the medical course of Gustavus is fyi- ished; Dr. Stuyvezant and he are kindred spirits; will he return to Eidelberg again at all?" "He thinks not; although the Vancleves love and respect him, they are inexorable with regard to his union with Adele, and allow him to go alone and lonely to his chateau." "I cannot condemn them, dear, feeling, as they do, the criminality of a consent, and her natural apostasy by such a course. No doubt they build upon Von. berg's influence and power to convert Elsie, and thus effect Ernest's return to the Papacy, else there would be dreadful inconsistency in the pleasure they evince in the prospect of that connection." "Poor, dear Elsie, an eventful career is before her between this and that period, aunt Meggy. May she stand fast in the Lord." "Amen! She will require much prayer.   She seems prepared for the warfare, dear child." "What length of absence does her mother allow her this visit?" "Only three days, Carl; I wish she could live with us altogether, she is so happy here; how longingly she desired it herself." "Yes; she thinks little of resigning her own if she could only have you for her mother. Iwish so too, in another sense, aunt Meggy." "You would desist, Carl, if you knew bow these   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      825 expressions distress me. If Cassy were to receive the idea, what would be the consequence?-a nearer con- nection between you cannot be. Coburg Vandoren was my first cousin-therefore Cassy is 7your almost sister; a union would be impossible-you know it, Carl-why labour to remove an insuperable barrier?" "I do desire, aunt Meggy, from my inmost heart, to be reconciled to the will of the Lord, but she is so surpassingly lovely, so entirely fitted to make a Chris- tian home all that would be desirable, that I do some- times feel inclined to inquire why this happiness was placed just within, and just beyond my attainment." "Will it mitigate your discontent, dear Carl, to learn I have the same regret? There is not another being on earth's surface to whom I would as willingly commit my child; but, Carl, the idea must be banished for ever. I hope yet to see you both eligibly settled, independent of each other." "Iwould be perfectly contented to have my pre-  sent condition sealed and unaltered for life, aunt Meggy; my tormenting anxiety is, that Cassy may be persuaded to become the leading star of some other home." "Let us trust, dear; there is no present prospect of such a catastrophe; particularly as Cassy has her mother's habit of contrasting all others with 'cousin Carl.' Carl Ravenscroft had no vanity, aunt Meggy was no flatterer, but there was more than gratitude in his 28*     326     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. warm good-night kiss; neither had Mrs. Vandoren ever again occasion to rebuke him. The three days' visit would come to a close. Elsie felt greatly strengthened by the wholesome advice of her uncle Eldrid, and was quite assured as she mounted her pony, and rode off amid the kind good- byes. She carried with her very many prayerful hearts and sympathizing spirits. The well-selected leaf was hidden in her bosom, and the directions of her cousin Carl strictly followed. Time wore away, and for months Elsie was undisturbed in her regular routine. She attended her uncle's church, and taught her Sabbath-school, but was always present at morning praying and vespers in the family of Dr. Vonberg. She was attentive to all her mother's commands, and never gave way to temper, even when there seemed provoca- tion. She noticed that the nervous attacks of her mother had become very frequent, and often so vio- lent as to confine her several days to her chamber. These had always been induced by opposition to her determined will; and Elsie knew, by the "Madam" of Dr. Vonberg, and her mother's haughty bearing towards him, that the fervent attachment of the first few months no longer existed. To herself he was uniformly affectionate; she suspected he must have sinister motives, for she very soon discovered her step-father had no heart. "Elsie, my daughter," he said to her, one morning after breakfast, folding one arm round her, and drawing her close beside him on the sofa, " it appears to me more than a little sur- 1h   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      327- prising, that when your mother has shown so much confidence in me as to select me for her own, and the guardian of her child, that Mr. Ravenscroft should still hold possession of your property. In my position, it could scarcely be questioned I am the proper person to direct your business affairs, and to invest your sur- plus income, which could be done much more advan- tageously at this very time, my child. I could nearly double your receipts, if you will make a transfer to me of your papers. Your mother expresses/her entire willingness, but tells me you are stubborn; I am sure I have never seen the least symptom of such a charac- teristic," he added, kissing her. "Dear Elsie, repre- sent the matter to your uncle; he surely will not refuse to acquiesce-it is so .very clearly for your benefit." Elsie, without changing her position, replied, very calmly, "My consent to your proposition would avail nothing, father. The promise of uncle Eldrid'Ra- venscroft, to place my papers in my hands with an unbroken seal at eighteen, lies buried with my own father; he told mamma so, when she made a similar request. I myself would never desire a transfer, as I am perfectly satisfied with my income. I am obliged to you, Doctor-father; but I wish no increase." "As you please," he said, withdrawing his arm. "You have an exceedingly contepted spirit; itof course is of no moment to me, only so far as I might serve you. I begin to think there is something of     328     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERO. obstinacy in your composition; your mother must be consulted respecting your dissent." A visit to Mr. Ravenscroft's study was the result. After an hour's debate, the carriage rolled away, and the Dominie, looking somewhat excited, joined his family at dinner. "My uncle and aunt Vonberg's call was official, father," said Carl; "I marvel if it was a concern of the soul?" "No, indeed! if such could be, I should doubt either had any. 3Iy brother Eghert's widow came to proffer an exchange of guardianship; to offer me Eghert's child, for her property-to give her the papers, and take Elsie!" "Good, good!" exclaimed Carl; "make Elsie joint heir with me, father, and let the property go; she can then live with us." "I would have no hesitancy, my son, in giving my brother's child an equal inheritance with you; but what would it avail? By no parchment could we retain Elsie, if her mother should choose to demand her, which, in the first splenetic attack, she would do, and Dr. Vonberg would find it easier .to pay homage to an heiress than a dependent; and, Carl, my word is held in the death-grasp of her father-'I will give these papers to Elsie only, to Elsie at eighteen, with the seal unbroken'--that promise is irrevocable. Mrs. Vonberg has all her own estate; it is the Ravenscroft division Elsie holds, and Elsie shall hold!" Hess Wintersteen would have been strongly re-   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     329 minded of the eagle. No one replied-all were con- vinced. "The wrath of aunt Annette will fall heavily upon Elsie, I fear," said Carl; "she will probably put an interdict on her visits here." "We shall meet very regularly at Sunday-school and at church; she cannot interfere with freedom of conscience," replied Cassy. "She will always enjoy her Sabbath privileges, and Vancleve chateau will afford us frequent opportunities of seeing her. Vonberg will never allow her to be debarred that house; he is endeavouring to ingratiate himself into Ernest's favour, with a hope of repairing his pecuniary condition. 'His chateau is now mort- gaged beyond its value." "What a dupe Annette has been, said Mrs. Van- doren; "his whole object must have been to obtain her property." "And would add that of Elsie to it with great plea- sure," replied Carl; "it is mournful she should be subjected to his society, and prohibited ours. But time wanes; Cassy, is not the 'Sea-Bird' to carry you to Eidelberg this afternoon-you prefer it to the bridge?" "Yes, Carl; and while you transact your business with Mr. Weber, I will make some visits, and see two or three poor families for Adele. She wrote by Elsie, asking me to do so, as she felt entirely unable." 'I can believe she is unequal to almost any exer-     330     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. tion; she seldom converses, and looks so frail, that I fear she is failing," replied Carl. "Ernest does not appear to observe the change in his sister," said Mr. Ravenscroft; "yet he did remark once to me, 'My sister is ripening for heaven.' And that little girl, your namesake, dear, seems hardly to belong to earth; she is a very remarkable child, she is a perfect magnet." "I never saw her equal," said Carl. "It is damp; heavy shawl and thick shoes," Carl called after Cassy, as she left the room to equip for the sail. She opened the door again, just to admit her head, and answered, "Yes, grandpapa." "That has always been a point of contention between Cassy and me," observed her mother; "her perfect health makes her regardless of exposure. She obeys me, of course; but it is a punishment to her to be wrapped up." "Well, here I am, enveloped in garment enough for any invalid. I shall surely be the victim to your and mother's carefulness, Carl." "Preserve your precious health, my child," inter- rupted her uncle, " the comfort of three lives depend upon yours." "I know it, uncle Eldrid, and would conscienciously avoid endangering it; but, indeed, Carl is worse than any old grandmother. I undergo inspection before every walk, ride, and sail, and never fail to hear a lecture on imprudence." a   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      331 '"I think you are benefiting some, daughter; few cousins would take so much interest." "Who mother? Carl!-why were I his twin sister, he could not take greater interest in me. "I never had a sister, but I cannot imagine how I could love one better than a first cousin; and an aunt Meggie is very like Carl Ravenscroft's mother," he added, kissing her good-by. "Meggie," said Mr. Ravenscroft, when the two cousins had left them, "is it only self-love in a degree, a little more remote, or are our children pecu- liarly gifted, and more lovely than most others? You and I are truly blessed with such a son and daughter." "We are, Eldrid, and I trust are grateful to the great Giver. I do not think we have been blind to their failings, yet I suppose all parents are prone to mark the better qualities of their children." "Carl's impetuous, ardent spirit, is so well balanced by his gentle, loving heart, that I have had very little trouble in training him. Elsie has the same tempera- ment, but she was kept constantly irritated by her mother." "She is passing through severe discipline now, poor child, thrown on her own resources entirely; how she must miss Carl." "Yes, Meggie, but it is this very discipline that will improve her character. Elsie has been too dependent on us all, she hardly thought for herself; and Carl shielded her constantly from what he called 'maternal      332     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. hostilities.' In a conversation with her, she told me she prayed daily for strength to endure patiently, and she never forgot she had not only the doctrines of the Protestant, but the character of a Christian to sustain; and she often felt at the close of a day of peculiar trial, how much she had been enabled to endure and overcome. Elsie is a timid child, yet I am inclined to believe she would exhibit great firmness when Christianity is assailed." "No doubt of it, Eldrid; she told me, but would rather her cousins and Ernest should not hear of it, that Dr. Vonberg, in a most evil way, tried to per- suade her to lend her aid to the choir at their rehears- ings on Saturday evening, telling, telling her it would not at all interfere with her devotions at her own church; being Saturday, he merely wanted her sweet voice to lead in some of the vesper-hymns, particularly one to the Virgin, which they lad some difficulty in singing.  He complained to her mother of her decided refusal to enter the Catholic chapel, even on a week day; and she taunted her with -having a very independent disobliging spirit, and a very ungarded and disrepect- ful tongue. In this manner she is frequently annoyed and distressed. I am glad Ernest extracted a pro- mise, that she would never enter the chapel under any circumstances, or read a book recommended by them. Vonberg has offered her several, but she has been very resolute in refusing to read them, much to his chagrin."

I objected, and endeavoured to dissuade him, but he persisted he was no more afraid of a change in the mind of Elsie, than that his sister' Cassy should desire to choose another brother. - I would not have listened to any one else a moment. What is your opinion, Meggie?  Carl and Cassy withstood me altogether; they both think Ernest Vancleve a paragon of per- fection." "O, Ernest has always been my standar rid.

Katrine rejoices over it, and consoles herself that her darling child will then get out of her unnatural mother's talons." "Yes, the tine will speed away more comfortably. with this expectation. Elsie no doubt is herself greatly buoyed up with it. Vonberg expresses him- self 'pleased,' her mother 'satisfied.' The contrary would make no difference with Elsie, only so far as her mother might throw difficulties in her path, were she opposed to the betrothal. Elsie did not wish the subject mentioned to her mother; but I was decided, and Ernest made the communication himself. He remarked subsequently, 'Mrs. Vonberg is an extra- ordinary person, sir.'

"He is premature with the titl,'Bertrand," said Mr. Ravenscroft, laughing-" who Was he?" "A young man I have often seen on the rocks; he once belonged to the Vonberg school; he did not mention his title, sir." Bertrand closed the door. "There is the Sea-bird, Eldrid; you may hear that girl laugh always before you see her." "Light hearts and easy consciences-happy child- ren-it is in vain to wish for our usual trio; over two years refuires some patience, Meggy." does, Eldrid-but here they come, and Elsie wit: them-it was her laugh;" and aunt Meggy ga- ed herself with pleasure, as she inquired where they had picked her up. "Out of a dolphin's mouth, aunt Meggy; had a combat for her, and promised to return her to-morrow morning at twelve precisely." At ten o'clock in the morning, Ernest Vancleve was seated with Mr. Ravenscroft in his study. Two hours were devoted by the Dominie every day to in- structing him for the same holy office. No interrup- tion was allowed during that time, and no one ever thought of intruding. Carl was reading with Dr. Baden at the same time, but very frequently was de- tained until a late dinner hour visiting with him. Ernest Vancleve had scarcely joined the ladies in the parlour, when he was informed by Bertrand that "the young gentleman who called yesterday was in the   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      335 study." Ernest, returning immediately, introduced Mr. Wintersteen to the ladies. Hess-for it was he- shook hands withi all the ladies, telling them he felt well acquainted with them from hearing so much of them from Mrs. Otenheimer, with whom he had been boarding a few days. "I suppose," he said, turning to Ernest, "you are a Dominie; I prophesied you would be." "Not yet-only on the road to preferment, Hess; but do tell us something of yourself. How long did you remain in College after my leaving there?" "You know but little of me if you ask that," returned Wintersteen. '"I was forcibly ejected by Dr. Ostend for smuggling Bibles into College about two months after that commencement; still, the deed was done, and the Spirit's operations finished the work. I, Vancleve, after a long and dark struggle, became, as I trust, the subject of Protestant gospel grace. I closed the eyes of Hans Wirtz in death, poor fellow." Hess dashed the tear from his eye, but it did not succeed; the handkerchief was found necessary, and for a time he wept in silence. At length Ernest inquired, "Hess, where are you located now? "At Brasburg, employed by the Missionary House as colporteur to distribute Bibles and Tracts; but it is Wirtz I would speak of first, and deliver his last message to you. As I was about to say, Hans died firm in the Protestant faith, triumphing in an only Mediator, Jesus. 'Tell him'-that is, you--'tell O              .     336     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. him I owe my salvation, under God, to his inde. pendent stand before the College tribunal; his words then took possession of my heart, and led me to seek Jesus, whom I have found a precious Saviour, the only atoning sacrifice. Tell him-tell him'--I have been endeavouring ever since to make a visit here," said Hess, wiping his eyes on witnessing the tearful ones of his auditors; "I might have written, but he said 'tell him.' He is not the only one, Vancleve; thirteen others, beside myself, from St. Gabriel's, have become Bible readers, and every one of them, as I have ascertained from reliable sources, are thorough- going, active Christians, disseminating the truth over the Continent. Vonberg and the fathers were very soon convinced of their mistake in making a public investigation, and this time were anxious to hush up the whole affair; but it is volcanic, and sooner or later there will be no partition wall between those schools, and St. Gabriel will declare itself on the side of Pro- testant truth, and the Bible will be her foundation stone also." Hess arose to go. "Mr. Ravenscroft and Carl will be in presently," said Mrs. Vandoren; "we cannot permit you to leave us before dinner, Mr. Wintersteen; they will be equally interested with us in your communications- and prophesies too," she added, smiling. "It certainly will be very agreeable to me," said Hess; "I always desired an acquaintance with this household-if I mistake not, President Vonberg mar- ried a lady of this family."   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      337 i He married my mother," replied Elsie, slightly colouring. "Yet you reside here still?" inquired this lineal descendant of Eve. "Not altogether," answered Mrs. Vandoren; "she lives with her mother. But you mentioned Brasburg, Mr. Wintersteen-" you are not permanently settled there, are you?" "Not anywhere permanently; I go where I am sent with books, and have been over almost half of Europe. I am generally well received. In a small village near Brasburg I met with Brock's wife; she has a little fancy store; she recognized me as an Eidelberg student, and railed out lustily against Brock's patrons for depriving him of his agencies. I could not sympathize, I was so well satisfied he had received his desert at last, inhuman man." "Yes, as soon as my father and others discovered that he was unfit for the authority with which he was empowered, they dismissed him from their employ. I did not know what had become of him." "Ernest," said Hess suddenly, with a peculiar twinkle of the eye, "how is Dr. Vance? and how is the pretty Miss Meta? is she married?" "I am not very well informed respecting any of that school, my sympathies you know are all with the other; but I believe the Professors are all well, and  the lady in question is not married, she is engaged to one of the graduates of St. Gabriel's." 29* e     338     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "To another of them! was there not some blunder about the one?' "You are a wizard, Hess, I do verily believe," said Ernest laughing, "1 made no blunder." "Ostend and Vance did. I had no conscience about using my ears at that time; I assure you it was all a scheme of theirs, to repair broken fortunes, but you slipped through their fingers, as did considerable sums from Baron Vancleve's purse slip through his. How I enjoyed the discourses of the two; I loved fun Ernest." "Too well for your own benefit, Hess, but these are by-gones. You know Lewellyn Bryant is study- ing for the pulpit." "Mrs. Otenheimer told me that, and many things that have occurred to rejoice me. How much occasion there is for gratitude in reviewing our lives. I have been led along by a way that I knew not; the hours of this day spent in this delightful circle, I shall re- count a subject for thankfulness." The entrance of Mr. Ravenscroft and Carl inter- rupted him. The latter received him very cordially, as he had just been hearing of his conversion, and sub- sequent activity in mission work from one of Dr. Baden's patients. He was introduced to Mr. Ravens- croft. Hess was courteously urged, and he willingly consented, to make the manse his home while at Eiseldorf. The day was passed in listening to his details of interesting incidents; among other things he mentioned having seen a relative of Carl, whom   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      339 he knew from the strong resemblance, and was induced to ask his name-it was Luis Valesez. "Carl's mother's sister's son, said Mr. Ravens- croft." "He is, and was interested in me so soon as he heard the name of Eiseldorf; my imperfect Spanish prevented free converse, but he made me understand a visit from .you, Carl, to your relations, would be 1 very acceptable."  "They have often written for me," said Carl, "but my home is so pleasant it makes me selfish." "He," replied Hess, "and doubtfgs his whole family are rigid Catholics; an M. D. would gain welcome access, where the mere card of a D. D. would be refused admittance, what good might you not do, Carl?" "It is a subject that must be taken into serious con- sideration. I shall be better able to chart out my fu- ture course, should the Faculty award me a diploma." "Not much fear of rejection I'm thinking, the degrees are to be given next month, I believe?" Carl nodded affirmatively. "Luis and I were born the same month," he said, "I would like to see him much." "You will look upon one of nature's models of mag- nificence," replied Hess; "there are few such speci- mens of her handy work afloat."  "Unqualified encomiums," said Elsie, laughing; "when little boys, I have heard that cousin Carl and Luis were mistaken for twin brothers."     340     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "And might be still, if Carl's curls were a shade darker." An involuntary laugh from the group, followed this reply, as the crimson mounted to the forehead of the subject of it. "Decidedly handsome, Hess, in your opinion," said Carl, joining in the mirth; "pity the inner man should not be as little defective." "Let it pass," replied Hess, with his peculiar laugh; "I am not often caught among the flattering; but to return-Dr. Ravenscroft might do much for his countrymen and Spanish relatives." "Carl evidently felt the force of this remark, but made no reply." "As I walked up the banks of the Niese," said Hess, changing the subject, "I saw a fellow chisel- ing his name on a rock; it threw me back to the time so many of us tried the same plan to immortalize our- selves. I now fully understand your remark, Ernest, as you declined cutting yours-' Better carve good deeds on human hearts:' and your President, Carl, observed, on seeing us so occupied, 'More conceit than wisdom in your employment boys, you will never find one of those names recorded elsewhere, or the originals distinguished for anything very meritorious.' I knocked mine off." "How many beautiful public edifices have been defaced by these nobodys," said Mr. Ravenscroft; unheard of names scribbled and cut on every most prominent place."   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      341 Mrs. Vandoren touched the bell, and the servants came in to worship. Wintersteen being fatigued re- tired immediately after to his chamber. Ernest took leave, Elsie promising to be at the chateau before break- fast. He had returned after dinner at the solicita- tion of Cassy, as Mr. Wintersteen's visit was particu- larly to him. Elsie remained all day with them at the manse. "We have not touched one note of our duett, Carl," said Gassy, shall we practise to-night? Mo- ther, is it too late?" "O! no, aunt Maggie, coaxed Elsie, it will not take long." Mrs. Vandoren smiled, and bid them good night." "Remember, children," said Mr. Ravenscroft, as he lighted his candle, "dreams are more acceptable than the sweetest music after eleven o'clock; it is now ten." "Our instruments shall be silenced at that hour, sir," answered Carl. "Kiss me, uncle Eldred, I shall not see you in the morning." "Between the two V's, uncle Eldred has but little of his darling," he replied, as he bent down to kiss Elsie good-night. The piece was diligently practised, and faithful to their promise the piano was closed, the guitars in their cases, and the cousins on the way to their respective rooms, as the clock told eleven. The business of Wintersteen occupied him some      342     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. days at Eiseldrof. As he exchanged farewells with the family at the manse, he felt a delightful sense of gratitude that he could enrol these Christians among his warmest friends. "He is unhewn," said Mr. Ravenscroft to Carl, after he had turned the hill, "but I like him much; he is admirably fitted for his situation, and there is a great deal in him." "A great deal, indeed, father, I never expected Hess Wintersteen would cause me to feel my own lit- tleness. My home attractions are too many for me, I must up and be doing." "God speed you, my son." CHAPTER XII. "To soothe their wounded heart with balm from the ama- ranths of heaven." cADELE is quite unwell this morning," said Lady Vancleve, as she seated herself at'the breakfast table; "I feel anxious she should have medical advice." "She seems reluctant to consult Dr. Bryant," said the Baron, "and I so much fear trusting her frail constitution to a stranger." Ernest looked anxiously, but made no remark; and soon leaving the table, he went to his sister's cham- ber. Her pallid appearance shocked him; so much altered from the day previous. He seated himself   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      343 quietly beside her; she did not appear to observe him, but lay with her eyes closed, and perfectly silent. Nanny, an old, faithful servant, who had been for thirty years a tried nurse in the Vancleve family, was standing near her. Day after day Ernest watched beside her, scarcely ever leaving, except at the call of Cassy, to perform some little kind office for her. "The weakness of our dear child certainly in- creases," said Lady Vancleve to her husband; "I can see a change for the worse daily. How shall we over- come her aversion to seeing Dr. Bryant?" "-I will go up, and endeavour to persuade her," he replied. As he entered, Ernest was supporting her head upon a pillow. Looking up, she smiled, and said, "This is my doctor and nurse, papa." "A very good nurse, my darling daughter, but you need a more skilful physician. Will you not allow me to send for Dr. Bryant?" Adele shook her head. "He never is of the slight- est use, father." "Let us have Dr. Baden," said Ernest; hiMs skill is so undoubted."       * "I fear his Protestant influence, my son; but if I could be certain that it would not be exerted, I should rejoice to place Adele under his charge." " would love to have him for my physician, dear     344     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. papa," whispered Adele, as Ernest resigned his pre- cious charge to the arm of his father. "The wish of my dear daughter is enough. Go for him, Ernest; let him come without delay." In about an hour Ernest returned, bringing Dr. Baden with him. A beam of pleasure lighted the countenance of Adele, as she saw him enter. Coming towards her bedside with one of his bright. est smiles, he said, "Why did you not send for me before, daughter?"But the moment his finger pressed the pulse, her father saw a change in the expression of his countenance. "I will give you a prescription down stairs, Baron Vancleve," he said. "What is your candid opinion, Doctor?" he asked, when they reached the library. "I fear you think there is but little hope; do not conceal the worst from me." "There is no disease, Baron Vancleve, not the slightest; but her system has entirely run down, owing to a too sensitive nature. The slightest trouble would act upon such a constitution; and if placed in circumstances in which her mind would be harassed, I would not answer for her life a single day. Tena- city of life is whaj she requires. If we could arouse an anxiety to live, to recover, to mingle again with the things of time, she would be restored. In many conversations I had with her while at Mr. Ravens- croft's, I was surprised to find how little hold she had   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      345 on life, and how anxious she was to find a resting- place beyond this world. I will speak-frankly to you; her hold on life is just as slight as a candle flickering in its socket, which a breath of air or touch would extinguish. In adverse circumstances, I have seen many such cases; but I confess, in regard to Adele, I am utterly at a fault, as, in every other instance, dis- tress of mind has been the acting principle. In the case of Adele, there is everything to make life desira- ble: surrounded with all that is pleasant, with a happy, grateful disposition, to appreciate all her bless- ings; yet she longs to take the wings of the morning, and flee away, and be at rest. She requires no medi- cine whatever, it would injure her materially; nutri- tive food will be the thing to prop her up. But the Lord is the hearer of prayer," he said, rising, and extending his hand to the Baron; " that is our strong- hold, after all, Baron Vancleve. I am going to visit some patients this side of the river; in about two hours I will return. In the meanwhile, avoid the slightest excitement; it would probably prove fatal." When Baron Vancleve was alone, there was a dis- agreeable impression left upon his mind. He was a firm believer in prayer, yet he could not reciprocate such a sentiment from the mouth of a heretic. Hl was dissatisfied and, unhappy. He was about return- ing to the chamber of his daughter, when he heard the voice of Father Antoine, inquiring for Adele. "My dear son," he said, as the Baron went for- ward to receive him, "I only returned from my cir- 30     346     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. cuit an hour since, and, at the first intimation of your affliction, I came to offer my kindest sympathy, and afford what spiritual consolation I could to our dear sufferer. Shall we go at once to her chamber?" "Not now, Father Antoine, her physician recom- mends entire quiet." "Of what importance is the poor body, compared with the never-dying soul, my son? Should that pass away unshrived, what would be its doom? I tremble when I think of the brink on which she stands." "I feel it; I know it, Holy Father: may her life be spared until she feels prepared to receive the unction at your hands." "There is a weight of sin for which our dear daughter has yet to answer. The confessional ne- glected, the-" "Holy Father, hold! my heart is already pierced with sorrow-in pity, refrain, refrain!" "None feel more for you than myself, my son. But are you not depriving her of the only hope of salvation?" "I will see her again, Father Antoine. It may be strength will be given her, and a mind to see the right." Dr. Ostend waited below, while the Baron went to the chamber of Adele. "Father Antoine is here, my child, and much desires to see you." The blood mounted to the face of Adele, and her   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      347 frame shook with emotion as she answered, "t I have seen him for the last time, father, as a spiritual ad- viser. I know he wishes to administer the last rites, but tell him that I need them not. I have fled to the only refuge, the sure refuge, and feel, and know, the blood of Jesus cleanseth from all sin. 'Jesus can make a dying bed, Feel soft as downy pillows are.' He has made mine even pleasant to me, and I feel that I am going to the bright world of spirits, a world where disappointments, or sin, or sorrow, of any kind, can never enter, and where all tears are wiped away." She could say no more; her strength was entirely exhausted by the effort, and sinking back on her pil- low, she lay apparently lifeless. Dr. Baden soon came in; a slight bow was the only recognition of Father Antoine, as he passed up stairs. "What has occurred?" he inquired; " there surely has been some exciting cause for this change." There was no answer; and, of course, the question was not repeated.  "Is she in immediate danger?" asked Ernest. "Not from this attack; there is much nervousness connected with it; use only the fan-no stimulating restoratives, the reaction would be too great." Baron Yancleve sent Bertha down to say to Father Antoine that Miss Adele was too ill to be left a mo- ment, but he would be happy to see him in his library on the morrow."     348     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. Mr. Ravenscroft had been a daily visitor at the chateau since the illness of Adele, and had been most kindly received by both Baron and Lady Vancleve. Elsie's offer to remain with little Cassy, and while away her lonely hours, was most gratefully accepted; and Gassy, charmed with her new companion, was quite happy. But did Ernest never leave his sister's side? He did. Twice a day he might be seen going towards the rooms of Gustavus Weber. Morning and evening he carried tidings of his sister. It would have been difficult to tell, when the friends met, whose grief was deepest. It may appear unmanly, but they were not ashamed to mingle their tears together, and weep over the fate of one who was dying a martyr to mistaken religion. Even in the few moments they passed together, they always commended her to her Re- deemer, and Ernest returned home more fitted to endure his bitter sorrow. "Would it not be possible to see her?"Gustavus inquired-" one last look, a farewell taken of that dear one, would be a consolation of which none have a right to deprive me. I will come and ask it as a boon at your father's hand-it must be granted-it will, I feel assured." "Act as you think proper, Gustavus; my father, I think, would grant anything that would gratify Adele." Ernest watched the lifeless form of his sister with sickening apprehension until-he saw some sign of   HEIGHTS OF ZIDELBERG.     349  returning life, then, yielding his seat to Dr. Baden, he threw himself on the couch completely exhausted. He soon fell into a sound sleep, from which he did not awake for an hour. Dr. Baden was still sitting beside the bed, fanning the sick girl. As he arose, he looked towards Adele, and his heart died within him; death could be traced on every lineament; the silence of Dr. Baden answered him, as he inquired in a whisper, How is she?" The stillness of death reigned; there was not a sound, excepting once or twice a stifled sob from Nanny. Baron Vancleve had left the room, and Ernest heard a voice speaking in the most earnest manner, which he at once recognized as that of Gus- tavus. It drew nearer-the voices ceased-light foot- steps were heard ascending the stairs. The heart of Ernest beat almost perceptibly; he gasped for breath as the door opened, and Gustavus entered. Lady Van- cleve rose to receive him, but Ernest seemed fastened to his seat. The hand of Dr. Baden was immediately extended, with a look .of surprised inquiry. Not a word was spoken; Gustavus seated himself at the foot of the bed, and resting his forehead on his hand, sat gazing upon the face of Adele. She opened her eyes slowly, and rested them upon him. A smile lighted her face, as she- said in a feeble voice-"Gus- tavus!" In a moment he was beside her, and leaning over her, kissed her forehead. "Adele!-my dear Adele!-do you recognize me?" 30*     350     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "Yes, Gustavus; I longed to see you, but did not like to request it." "Any request, daughter, I should have rejoiced to grant," said her father; " and if you have now any ungratified wish, only name it." "Will you not grant my request, Baron Vancleve?" said Gustavus, taking the hand of Adele in both of his, "let me have the consolation of calling your daughter by the endearing name of wife: let me, in her last monfents, have the privilege of being with her-the right to watch over her, night and day." Dr. Baden said nothing, but stood gazing at Gus- tavus in perfect astonishment; intimate as he had been with him, he had never suspected his attach- ment. Baron Vancleve remained silent, with his eyes fast- ened on the floor. It was a call so unexpected, that he was at an entire loss how to act. To entrust his daughter, in her dying hour, with one branded as the worst of heretics by Father Antoine! Yet how could he refuse? It could not harm her more than being with Ernest. He cast an imploring glance at Lady Vancleve, and laid his cheek on that of Adele. "What is your wish, daughter." ("I would have it as Gustavus says, father." "Has it your sanction, Henriette," he asked. "My most cordial one," was the reply. "From my heart I thank you, Lady Vancleve," said Gustavus, tenderly embracing her, "I shall now be comparatively happy, even in my bereavement."   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      351 "You will wait until to-morrow, my son," said Dr. Baden, "Adele is already too much fatigued. To night I will leave you in my place as a physician. I had intended remaining; but as I can with perfect confidence resign her to your care, I will return home. Early in the morning I will again see her." "Baron Vancleve," asked Gustavus, '"shall Mr. Ravenscroft be invited to return with Dr. Baden to-morrow." "Father Antoing is Adele's clergyman, Gustavus, that must be left to her discretion. What will be your choice, daughter?" "Of my choice you can judge, father. I desire it should be known that all my hope is in the blood of Jesus shed on Calvary; to that cross alone I cling; on that Rock alone I build my hope. Sprinkled with atoning blood, I fear not to die. Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life; and I am accepted in the Beloved." The face of Baron Vancleve was closely hidden in the pillow; that of Lady Vancleve was suffused with tears. Nanny looked much dissatisfied, and crossed herself frequently. Ernest rose hastily and left the room. Dr. Baden drew near to the bedside, and leaning over, whispered in the ear of Adele, "Upon a world of woe life's curtain falling, to arise anew on realms of glory." A tear glistened in the eye of Adele; a return of the warm pressure of his hand was the only answer.     352     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. Beckoning Gustavus to follow, he proceeded to the library, to give him some directions for the night, and returned home. Adele almost immediately sank into a deep sleep. Her mother sat beside her; and old Nanny, wearied with watching, took a pillow, and laid herself upon the floor before the fire. "You will retire, Baron Vancleve," said Gustavus, "and try to obtain a little rest. Adele's sleep is natural and comfortable; there is at present nothing to fear." The Baron consented, with the promise that he should be called if the slightest change were percep- tible. Ernest laid himself upon a couch in the same room, and slept heavily from perfect exhaustion. A faint light was glimmering in the east ere Adele awaked. "Have I slept long, mamma?" she asked. "It is now nearly morning, daughter. Do you feel refreshed?" "O, yes, mother; my dreams were so sweet; angels hovered around me, fanning me with gentle breezes, and whispering softly, 'Come away, come away.' Then the softest strains of music met my ear, and died away with every breeze. I felt I was just at the outer gate of the Celestial City. I longed to enter; but a voice whispered, 'Not yet, not yet. Come in your own good time; your days are numbered; and you shall have entrance here; but remain yet a little while, and be a solace to those who need you.   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      353 I felt grieved, but turning, I saw Gustavus cast a pleading look upon me. I went towards him, but before I reached him I awoke; but in so calm a frame, it seemed I had really seen him. Was he here, mother?" 'Yes, daughter, last night he stood beside you." "Did any thing occur, mamma?" she asked, speak- ing in the lowest tone. "Was there not some favour asked by Gustavus, and granted by papa? or, was it but a dream?"  "What would be your desire, my precious daugh. ter?" "A union with Gustavus, mother," she answered timidly, "if it were not a dream. It would be a con- solation to him to call me wife, though for a little moment; and when the grave closes over me, he can mourn for one belonging to himself. I desire to lie beside him, mother; to rise in the resurrection with him; to stand upon the sea of glass, side by side, and cast our crowns together at the feet of Jesus." Gustavus, completely overcome, and fearing to ex- cite her, stole softly into an adjoining apartment. There, finding a private stairway leading to the front door, he descended, and went to his own rooms. Adele had brought death before him so vividly, that every spark of hope was. extinguished. Her dream was but a foretaste of that heaven she was so soon to enjoy. The strongest German mind is naturally tinctured with superstition, and Gustavus was not proof against it.     354     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. After refreshing himself with a bath, he sat down, and endeavoured to collect his thoughts, he opened his Bible. On the first page that met his eye was the account of the ruler's daughter. He was led to it, surely led to it, to incite to prayer. She would perhaps be given to his supplications. There was the same kind Friend now, as he who spoke to Jairus of old--"Thy daughter liveth." "I will go to Jesus," said he, rising; it may be he will hear my pleading, and spare the life of her who is now dearer to me than ever." He entered his closet, and there, with strong crying and tears, he presented his petition; he besought that her life might be spared; he said, "I will not let thee go, until thou bless me." He offered the prayer of faith, he believed, and rose from his knees, certain of the recovery of Adele. For one hour and a half he had wrestled in prayer, and had prevailed-at least, such was his impression. Dressing himself with far more than usual care, he again started for the chateau. Several times he stopped to endeavour to realize his situation. Was he an admitted visitor at the chateau; was he about to become the husband of Adele, with Baron Vancleve's consent. There has been much prayer for her reco- very. I feel that it is only to the fervent effectual prayer of the righteous that the Lord lends a hearing ear. His mind reverted to Dr. Baden, Mr. Ravens- croft, Carl, and Ernest, and he offered a prayer of silent thanksgiving2 that he was surrounded with so   HEIGHTS OP EIDELBERG.      355 many friends, whose hearts were always touched as with a coal from the altar of the Almighty. He was aroused from this reverie by hearing his own name pronounced. It was Ernest.   Gustavus was shocked at his altered appearance, his lip quiver- ed, as he addressed him. "I. never before fully realized her loss, Gustavus, and was buoyed up with some little hope. But that dream-she was too near the celestial city, and saw too much for mortal eyes. I fear she is only waiting to be united to you. Her spirit will then wing its flight to those mansions of rest for which she is so well fitted." Gustavus gently placed his arm in- that of his friend, and led him to the brink of the river. Seat- ing himself upon a rock, he pointed to Ernest to sit beside him. There was a subdued expression in that face, which Ernest had never before witnessed, but not a ray of sadness. "As sure as this river ebbs and flows, Ernest," he said, in a low but decided tone, "so sure will Adele recover. She will not pass away as the morning cloud, and the early dew, but will be restored to health." His voice rose as he spoke, and his eye gleamed with pleasure as he continued: "Believe me, she will yet be the mistress of my chateau, the idol of all hearts there, and will be the instrument of the conversion of many, ere she is called to walk the streets of the new Jerusalem." Ernest clasped his hands together, and raising his     356     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. eyes to heaven, said, "God grant it may be realized. It is almost too much to hope, Gustavus." "I have an assurance it will be so. But, come, we must go to the chateau; it is now eight o'clock, at half-past eight Mr. Ravenscroft will cross the  river." Breakfast was just placed upon the table when they arrived, but Ernest, declining partaking of it, went to his sister's chamber. Dr. Baden shortly after came in, accompanied by Mr. Ravenscroft. "What report have you of my patient, Dr. Weber?" inquired the Doctor. "She has had quite a comfortable night, sir, and she speaks this morning with a much stronger voice." "There is no more favourable symptom in her case," he replied, as he followed Baron Yancleve up stairs. Gustavus and the Dominie were left alone. "My son," said the latter," God is the hearer of prayer, and I trust Adele will be given to our suppli- cations. Neither Dr. Baden nor I went to bed last night, but remained in prayer together, and I think we offered the prayer of faith for her restoration." Gustavus grasped his hand, his heart was too full for utterance. "My father desires you will come up stairs with Dr. Weber, Mr. Ravenscroft," said Ernest, coming in at this moment, and taking the hand of the latter   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      357 in his own. "Adele seems much better, and is ready now to have the ceremony performed." Gustavus started up. "Let it take place as soon as possible," he said. "I have had so many bitter disappointments, I feel almost superstitious in re- gard to it. It seems a happiness too great to be realized." His flushed cheek and excited manner almost alarmed Ernest. "Be calm, dear Gustavus," he said, laying his hand upon his arm; "any excitement would affect Adele sadly." "Iam ready to follow you, Ernest," he replied. You will precede us, if you please. Our Dominie will not be more calm than myself, I assure you." A smile of pleasure lighted the face of Adele, as Mr. Ravenscroft entered. He gently took her hand in both of his, and whispered, "Be of good cheer, daughter, Jesus is a very present help in every time of trouble." "I have realized it fully, Mr. Ravenscroft, while passing through deep, deep waters. I thought I had entered the dark valley, and hoped soon to reach my home, but now--" she hesitated, and the colour mounted slightly to her temples. "But now," repeated Mr. Ravenscroft, with a benignant smile, and still holding her hand, "there is a lingering look behind, daughter." "I feel better, Mr. Ravenscroft. I do not feel so 31     858     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. near the eternal world; and," she added, lowering her voice, "I would like to stay a little longer." "Dear child," he replied, much moved, "I trust many, many happy days are yet in store for you." She pressed his hand, but said nothing. Mr. Ravenscroft brushed away a tear, and placing his hand upon her head, he stood with his eyes closed, evidently in prayer. Gustavus had seated himself beside Elsie, and, at her invitation, had taken Cassy upon his knee. "Sister is going to be married," she whispered, ( to a rettic-Bertha said so. What is getting married to a rettic? Is it anything bad?" "Not at all; very good indeed, Cassy." "Is it, Mr. Weber? Then what made Bertha cry so? "Because she didn't know what a rettic was. I am a rettic, and am going to be married to your sister, and will help mamma take care of her." "That will be splendid," she still whispered, clap- ping her hands very gently together, and putting her face very close to his; "then I shall have two bro- thers-will I?" "You will, indeed," he replied, kissing her fondly; "I will be brother Gustavus." They were interrupted by Dr. Baden, who whis- pered in his ear. Gustavus immediately arose, and advanced to the bedside of Adele. "It is better," said Dr. Baden, pleasantly, "that Mr. Ravenscroft should tie this knot before my little   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      359 patient quite tires herself talking to our Dominie here. I know, of old, her predilection for this gen- tleman." Mr. Ravenscroft smiled, and moved aside, to permit Gustavus to stand near Adele. Ernest, placing his arm under her pillow, raised her head gently. Baron Vancleve slowly arose, and came to the foot of the bed; his eyes were fixed very sadly upon his daughter, and he seemed with difficulty to restrain his emotion. Lady Vancleve stood beside him. Adele, wrapped in her own thoughts, did not appear to notice them. When Mr. Ravenscroft asked the question, if those present knew any cause why these two persons should not be united, a deep sigh escaped the Baron, almost amounting to a groan. Mr. Ravenscroft was startled. He cast his eyes towards him; but meeting a meaning glance from Ernest, he proceeded. Adele seemed to have almost unnatural strength; her voice did not falter through the whole ceremony, until Gustavus placed the ring upon her finger. She then seemed rather exhausted, and said, feebly, "Lay me down, Ernest; I am fatigued." When she was arranged comfortably, and appeared. quite revived again, Mr. Ravenscroft said,- "We will now lift up our hearts to God, and ask his blessing upon this union." Baron Vancleve had seated himself near Adele, and placed her hand in his.     360     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. All arose, and bowed the knee before God; Baron Vancleve alone remained sitting. When the prayer was finished, Mr. Ravenscroft and Dr. Baden took leave. Baron Vancleve saw them down stairs. "My posi- tion to-day has been a most difficult one, Mr. Ravens- croft," he said; "it has been a constant strife between courtesy and conscience. You know my views, and will therefore forgive my apparent incivility." "I am not the one to prescribe rules, my dear sir," replied Mr. Ravenscroft, laying his hand kindly on his arm; "we must come to the same point, after all. Whoever may be the labourer, God alone gives the increase." "Yes," he replied quickly, "but the Almighty has his own appointed way." "There is no other way," was the reply. "I am the way, the truth, and the life; no man cometh unto the Father, but by me." "I am the resurrection and the life, he that believeth on me, though he were dead, yet shall he live." The Baron shook his head, and the gentlemen each offering him a hand, which he shook most cor- dially, took their leave. The eye of Baron Vancleve followed them until almost out of sight. As he turn- ed from them, the thought intruded itself, "Can such men be doomed to eternal perdition?"Shocked be- yond measure, he retired to his chamber, to seek by penances to obtain pardon for the sin of having such a doubt arise, feeling that only the enemy of souls   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      361 could have induced such a supposition in regard to two known heretics. "Adele has fallen asleep," Gustavus remarked to Lady Vancleve, "she is quite exhausted, and will pro- bably sleep some time. Will not you try to seek some rest?" Lady Vancleve shook her head. "If you would just take the couch for a little while, mother," said Ernest, "I should feel more comfort- able." She mechanically obeyed, but her restless eye con- stantly wandered to the sleeping girl. The young gentlemen, Elsie and little Cassy, went down into the library, in order to have the room perfectly' quiet, leaving the faithful old nurse care- fully watching. "And now Cassy," said Mr. Weber, again placing her upon his knee, of which she had been so uncere- moniously deprived, "I am your real brother Gusta- vus."  "Are you really," she asked, opening her large blue eyes, and scanning him very closely. "Yes, really-and I am going to live here, and take care of sister, until she is quite well." "O! that will be lovely; and when sister can spare you, will you let me read some of my little books to you." "Certainly, I shall love dearly to hear them." "And then, Mr. Weber-" 31*     362     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "Brother Gustavus!" "Oh! yes, brother. Do you think Christabus is a very pretty name. Shan't I say brother Weber?--that is beautiful." "Rather of the clerical order for a plain Doctor," he remarked, laughing. "I will be brother Weber, if you like it." At that moment, John opened the door of the library, and Dr. Ostend entered. His piercing eye took in the group at a glance, and bowing coldly, he inquired for Baron Vancleve. "Be seated, Dr. Ostend," said Earnest, placing a chair for him. "My father has retired to his cham- ber, much fatigued, and has requested not to be dis- turbed. But if you wish it, I will send up for him." "Certainly not," was the forced reply. "My call this morning was induced particularly to inquire for the health of Miss Vancleve." "This is the only representative left of that name," said Elsie, laying her hand on the head of Cassy. Father Antoine looked inquiringly, but no farther remark being made, he continued, "How is your sister to-day, Mr. Vancleve." "We hope better, sir; Dr. Baden considers her symptoms favourable." "And how do you do, little Gassy?" he said, placing one hand upon her head, and lifting her chin with the other to kiss her. "I suppose you miss sister very much." "Yes, sir; but, brother, Mr. Weber, is going to live   HEIGHTS OP EIDELBERG.      363 with us, and take care of her, and play with me when she can spare him. Sister was married to him this: morning, and that gives me two brothers-isn't that lovely?" "What am I to understand by the two brothers?" he asked, turning to Ernest, affecting to misunder- stand Cassy. "Miss Vancleve, this morning, took the name of Mrs. Weber," replied Ernest; "it is a matter very easily understood." Father Antoine bit his lip. "It was her father's- wish that I should see and converse with her on holy  things," he said, turning to Gustavus. "I thank you, sir," he coldly replied; "the daily visit of Mr. Ravenscroft will save you all trouble of that nature. She will defer seeing you until she gets down stairs." "You will give my respects to Baron and Lady Vancleve," he said, hastily rising. Ernest arose, and slightly bowed. As he was about leaving the door, not deigning again to address Ernest, he turned to John-"Tell your master, my man, that I shall be happy to see him at my study between the hours of six and seven this evening." John bowed low, but Ernest observed that the sign of the cross upon his bosom, a respect he had always paid the holy father, was omitted. A cold, and dis- tant bow, was all that was vouchsafed to Ernest, and Dr. Ostend left the step. "I so much feared," said Elsie, " that Dr. Ostend     364     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. would offer to accompany me home. I want to spend this evening at uncle Eldrid's." "You are not going so soon, Elsie; it will be a great disappointment, as we are just looking up, and will be able to enjoy your society." "Mamma's order is positive-I must obey." Dr. Ostend might have offered in vain; his ser- vices are not needed. I shall take you across the bridge at any hour that suits you." "Thank you, Mr. Vancleve; that is what I depend upon. Between three and four this afternoon I should prefer starting." In a short time Bertha entered, to say that Mrs. Weber was awake. Dr. Weber had been walking the floor, manifesting a little impatience for a message. "We will go up, Gustavus," said Ernest; "and in five minutes I will return, Elsie, and study your Bible lesson with you, for your class on Sunday." Lady Vancleve had risen from her couch unre- freshed and miserable. Not so Adele; her eye had assumed its lustre, and her pulse, Gustavus said, beat almost naturally. Ernest took his accustomed seat beside her, and kissed her cheek. "Place your arm under the pillow, Ernest," she said; "I am going to take some nourishment, and my head is rather low." Ernest was about complying, when a cunning glance from his friend told him that there was some division of property now.   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     365 Stop, Mr. Vancleve-resign that post; I see your forwardness requires checking." "Pardon," replied Ernest, rising, with a mock bow: "I hope, in future, I shall be taught humility; but, I would humbly suggest, that example is better than precept." "I stand corrected," he replied. 'Resume your seat, until I have attended to other duties. Lady Vancleve, allow me, as a physician, to prescribe rest in your own chamber, and, as a son, let me have the privilege of taking you to it. Shall I not call you by the endearing name of mother," he asked, as she took his proffered arm, and slowly proceeded to her room. "Yes, my son, I should much prefer that title." "In a few moments they reached the door, which was opened by Baron Vancleve. He smiled on seeing Gustavus, but in a moment his countenance resumed its former sadness. "My dear father, if that title may be allowed me," said Gustavus, pressing the Baron's hand, "I longed to express my gratitude to you, for the gift you have bestowed upon me; and I promise faithfully to per- form the part of an affectionate son, and endeavour feebly to repay my debt to you. Father," he con- tinued, dropping on one knee before him, "I crave your blessing, a son's blessing. I desire to hear that endearing name applied to me. Yesterday, I felt my- self an alien, wherever I might go. Now, how changed'! My heart would overflow, did I attempt to express my feelings."     866     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. The hand of Baron Vancleve was placed upon his head. "God bless my son-would I could say, my son in the faith-and may he walk in that path which alone leads heavenward." "Truly, I can add an Amen to that," he replied, rising. "In my hand no price I bring, Simply to the cross I cling." Tears flowed freely, as Gustavus, affectionately kiss- ing the cheek of Lady Vancleve, and again clasping the hand of the Baron, gently closed the door, and sought Adele's apartment. "Come, Master Vancleve, it is time you were at your Bible lesson, ten minutes have elapsed instead of five; and, from the slight cognizance I have taken of matters, your task is neither arduous nor disagreeable. Take care of your heart, Ernest, such a young lady will not lack suitors.' "I am not ashamed to confess," replied Ernest, slightly colouring, "that I have provided a little against that calamity." "But what, if she should change her mind. *Do you place implicit confidence in her childish pur- poses?" "No mind of twenty is more matured than that of Elsie; but if any transfer of affection should take place, sooner should my heart break, than hold her bound one moment."   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. -67 "And how do your own links stand?" asked Adele, smiling. "Bound with a grasp of iron, to be sundered only by death; as closely linked as though the Dominie had linked them. Do you ask such a question seri- ously, of me, sister?" "No, brother, certainly not. But you had better hasten down, or she will be apt to think it is not very well cemented." We will now, for a few moments, follow Baron and Lady Vancleve, as the door closed upon them. "Truly, we have cause for gratitude," she rev marked, " that the Lord has added such a young man to our household. Few, very few, are like him. He must be brought to think aright in the end." The Baron paced' the floor hastily. "And the influence of Elsie over the mind of Ernest," she continued; "Dr. Vonberg has no doubt she will be brought into the Church of her ma- ternal ancestry; that is my stronghold in regard to Ernest." "I much fear the influence of Ernest over her young mind will be far greater," replied the Baron. "I confess I am at an utter loss in regard to my family; and this meeting with Father Antoine, I cannot help dreading. His feelings are so spiritual- ized, that he can make no allowance for youth, parental feeling, nor indeed for anymotive which has not a heavenly basis-esteeming them all entirely carnal. Truly, he is so filled with heaven and heavenly things,.     368     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. that he cares nought for earth. His works of super- erogation must be numberless." "I have never felt that the work of another can be laid over to my account," she replied. "On that point I have always been incredulous." The Baron started. "Do you doubt anything offered as truth by the Fathers, Henriette?"    ? "I have tried to believe it, and have often confessed the sin to Father Antoine. I have performed all the penances suggested by him in vain; and I own to you, Lorenzo, that when my mind is tortured with all these doubts and difficulties, I feel that if I could find access to the Saviour, he would supply all my wants." The cheek of the Baron became pale as ashes, and his lips quivered, as he answered, "It is a delusion of the devil, Henriette; the very same that has tortured me for weeks. The texts which Ernest has so often, and so impressively repeated, are fastened indelibly upon my mind, and nothing but the power of the Blessed Virgin can ever eradicate them. We are a nmost unfortunate, a doomed family, Henriette. When I think I have almost obliterated them, under some hard pressure, Satan brings one into my mind, that appears exactly to meet my case, and I can scarcely refrain from committing the mortal sin of rushing into the presence of the Almighty. My mind is on the rack, and tortured with apprehension, which Father Antoine only increases. For six days I have taken scarcely enough food to sustain life; yet the holy Father --"              ^I   HEIGHTS OF, EIDELBERG.     369 recommends greater abstinence. Almsgiving he im- presses most strenuously, although I have already brought my large estate heavily into debt." "Your generosity never knew any bounds, Lorenzo. On that subject, surely, Father Antoine need not dwell. Let us both try to take some rest; and may the Holy Mother mediate with her Son for us, that we may know the right, and find the way to peace and happiness once more." At five o'clock the family gathered around the dinner-table. "This is my last meal here, I fear, Lady Vancleve," Elsie remarked, as she arose from the table, and put on her bonnet. "Mamma is complaining much of my absence; I shall therefore be obliged to remain at home for some time." "I will write to your mother on the subject, Essie," she replied; "we cannot long do without you.) They both kissed her affectionately, and she took leave, accompanied by Ernest. As they were passing Michael's door, Ernest proposed they should make them a short visit. "They will'feel themselves quite neglected," he remarked; "Adele's sickness has driven everything else from my remembrance." Opening the door gently, they heard Michael read- ing the Bible, and found him surrounded by his whole family. He stopped when he perceived them, and looked slightly confused. 82     870     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "I am rejoiced, Michael," said Ernest, "to see you employed in this manner. How long is it since you felt the value of this blessed word'? I feel rather hurt that I was not informed of the change." "Well, I'll jist tell you all about it, Misther Er- nest. I thought you and Father Antoine, being rather at outs, Hwould'nt add anything to your diffi- culthy, as he is rather a hard person to elude." "I should not wish to elude him," replied Ernest, 'I am perfectly independent of Dr. Ostend." Michael shook his head. "He's daper than ye think, Misther Ernest-daper than the sa in its dapest spots; but till my eyes were opened to sa the truth, I was blind to him althegither. The first time my faith was something shaken in his opinionbeing infallible, was when I wint on an errand to Dominie Ravenscroft's, whom Father Antoine told us was nither more nor less than a divil in human shape. It was Christmas-eve, two years back. I trimbled at the intrance of such a place, and crossed myself to be presarved from harm. I went to the kitchen door, where I found Katrine, who was a friend of Mally's, a tuckin up the corner of her apron, and the tears quite a rollin down, and I says, 'An sure, has any thing happened to ye, jist now?'  "'Come in, Michael,' says she, 'and I'll tell ye.. It isn't for sorrow, but for pleasure, I'm a cryin. Never was such masters and mistresses brathing as lives in this very house.' So she took me up over the kitchen, and showed me a nice little room, fixed   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      37:1 off for a present for her, where she and Bertrand and a friend; if they liked it, could sit like princes, afther their work was done. 'This all comes of the Lord, Michael,' says she, 'that puts such things into the heart of his own people. " "Just then, who should come in but Miss Gassy, bless her swate face, and, says she, 'Michael, I want you to take these to the childer, and put them in their stockins the night.' With that she hands me a package, and smiled jist like as if I'd been somebody more than Michael Malony. My heart was full to the brim, and I thought which ever world these are to paple, to there I would just like to go. Then some time afther, having great distress in my back, which cost me no little with Dr. Bryant, and was none the betther, but rather the worse, I thought I would just spake to the Doctor that's now a waitin on Miss Adele, and he hardly heard me out afore he says, 'Now, Michael, you must lay by for a few days, and I'll come myself and see you to-morrow.' He was true to his word-came every day, as you know, for a month, and not a cent did he ever charge me. When I spake my thanks to him, he said, 'I desire to. do like my Master, Michael; he went about doing good. Now I want you to remember that although it's a great thing to have health, the soul is of far more value, because that lives long after the body is dust and ashes. " "'And that's the thing sir,' says'I, {I want jist to larn.'     372     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "'Then take this Bible,' says he, drawing this very one from his pocket, 'and it will teach you the way to heaven. " "'But, sir,' I answered, 'I fear Father Antoine, if he -hears it, will lave no stone unturned to make me lose my place.' " "Then he looked awful solemn upon me, and said, 'Fear not them that can only kill the body.' Then he prayed with me, and I felt good thoughts come into my soul, and I read the book daily, and he came and explained it, and took me to the young Doctor's room in the College, where Peter, and a dozen more- once bitther Catholics-met, once a week, to study the word of God, and Dr. Weber prayed and exhorted. I now bless God that he led me to the Dominie's that night, for it was the beginning of good things to my soul." Elsie's eyes were suffused with tears, as she warmly shook the hand of Michael. "Truly, O Father," ejaculated Ernest, as he closed the door, " thou hast hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes." CHAPTER XIII. THE hour of six had arrived, and Baron Vancleve left his home to keep his appointment with Dr. Ostend. His nerves, shattered by the events of the day, were entirely unstrung, and his hand trembled   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.3   as he laid it upon the study door. No voice bade him enter, and, on opening the door, he saw the form of Dr. Ostend prostrated before a large crucifix, immova- ble as a statue. The stillness of death reigned. For a long time the Baron stood irresolute whether to leave the room. At length, concluding to do so, he was about retreating, when Father Antoine slowly arose, and advanced to meet him. "I fear I have disturbed you, Holy Father; pardon my intrusion at this sacred hour." "My whole soul was wrapt in holy meditation. I needed strengthening after all I endured this morning, and the Blessed Mother has vouchsafed me her pre- sence and her blessing." "May I not receive your blessing, Holy Father?" "Blessing!- Ioreozo Vancleve! Were you not a watchman upon the city walls, and have you not ad- mitted a traitor within its limits?" The head of the Baron bent low beneath his pene- trating eye; his knees smote together, and he almost fell into the first chair near him. "Holy Father," he replied, in a tone of the deepest humility, "the petition of my dying child was the sore temptation that in an evil hour prevailed." "Was the soul of that dying child of no value in your eyes?" he asked. "Was that wish, instigated by Satan, to be weighed in the balance with her never- dying soul, now doomed for ever to certain destruc- tion? She has committed a deed from which my whole nature shrinks, and which must call down our      374     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. anathemas upon her. Gustavus Weber is a sworn enemy of our Holy Church; he has unfurled his ban- ner, and bidden defiance to every thing connected with it. I have watched him narrowly; he has given no less than a hundred Bibles to my parishioners, and the reception that I receive among them in con- sequence is cold and distant, sometimes almost uncivil. You are probably not aware that your own household have felt his influence; your very servants are daring to take a stand, omitting the sign of the cross in my presence." He stopped, and seating himself opposite the Baron, remained perfectly silent. "Holy Father," said the Baron, " what penance can I perform, or what endure, to avert all these sore judgments? O that I could be restored to your favour, and once more be thought worthy to be called your son!" "That is a question with which I have been occu- pied all day-one glimmering of hope arose." "Mention it, Holy Father; whatever it may be, I am willing to accede to it." "Our church wants almost rebuilding; the Ma- donna requires resetting, and St. Peter is becoming quite dilapidated-a gift for that holy purpose might be acceptable to the Blessed Virgin." "What amount would be required?" "The sum needed would scarcely be less than ten thousand thalers." "It will require some sacrifice of stock just now,"   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     375 replied the Baron, "but it shall be done imme- diately." "The greater the self-denial, far greater will be the merit." A note for the amount was drawn out by Father Antoine, and with trembling hand signed by the Baron. Lady Vancleve was shocked at his haggard appear- ance as he entered the drawing-room, and the prac- tised eye of Dr. Weber saw some premonition of palsy in the slightly drawn mouth, which, however, soon passed away without being noticed by any other member of the family; and Gustavus, fearful of alarming them, made no remark upon it. Weeks rolled by; the health of Adele improved daily; but Baron Vancleve evidently declined. Be- tween the hours of ten and eleven a nightly visit was regularly paid by Dr. Ostend to his library, and the evil effect on the nerves of Baron Vancleve was visible to all. As Dr. Bryant was absent from home, he had placed himself under the charge of Dr. Baden. "Time is rolling on, Adele," said Gustavus; "three months have passed since I called you mine, and I long once more to see my home, which I can now feel will be a home indeed." "But papa's health, Gustavus?" , If we can only make a visit for a month, it will be a great satisfaction to my people to become ac- quainted with their new mistress."     376     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "Is Lewellyn there still?" "He is; but Mr. Ravenscroft has invited him to study with him for six months. He will then go to the Theological Seminary for two years." "Your arrangement, no doubt," she said, smiling. The smile was returned, but the question remained unanswered, as the left hand of Dr. Weber seldom knew the good deeds of the right. The day was appointed for their departure, a week after this conversation, and Lady Vancleve proposed inviting a few of the friends of Gustavus to join them at dinner ere they left Eidelberg. President Stuy- vezant, Mr. Ravenscroft, Carl, Dr. Baden, and Baron Kieft, were of the number. The party assembled, and a more pleasant group was seldom congregated on the Heights of Eidelberg. One of a light cast of character would probably have pronounced it dull, as the loud laugh was seldom heard. Conversation flowed freely, each bearing his part in it. President Stuyvezant descanted largely on domestic happiness- on the love manifested by Providence in setting the solitary in families. As he went on, describing a home scene, his eye kindled, and his cheek glowed with pleasure. "I am surprised, Dr. Stuyvezant," remarked Baron Vancleve, "with your views on this subject, you have never married." "No one, Baron Vancleve," he replied, "has ever realized more fully the blessing of a congenial home. Left, at an early age, with a sacred trust-a widowed   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      3" mother and three sisters, much younger than my- self-I could not, had I desired, have assumed other responsibilities." As he looked towards the Baron, he was shocked to see the glassy appearance his eye had assumed, as he essayed to answer him. The next instant, Dr. Baden and Gustavus sprang from their seats, and rushed towards him; but before they reached the spot, he fell prostrate on the floor. Ernest threw himself be- side him in agony. "OO! my father, speak! speak to your son once more!' he cried. "My' son," said Mr. Ravenscroft, "endeavour to be calm. All now depends upon strenuous exertion." "He has been the sacrifice, the tool of that vile serpent, Dr. Ostend!" he cried, springing up, and clasping his hands together, and if his life is the for- feit, he shall be proclaimed a murderer-a murderer of the best, the kindest of fathers." Mr. Ravenscroft took his arm and led him into the library. Locking the door, he remained with him until he became somewhat calmer. Blood was taken immediately from the arm of Baron Vancleve, and mustard placed upon his feet, but for an hour there was no sign of returning life. He at length slowly opened his eyes, and fearfully looking round said, "Is he here?" "Who, my love?" asked Lady Vancleve. At this moment Ernest again entered. A mattrass     378     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. and bed had been laid upon the floor, and Baron Van- cleve placed upon it. His son knelt beside him. "Was it Ernest for whom you were inquiring?" asked his wife. Laying his hand gently upon his head, he smiled, and said, "May heaven bless my boy. My inquiry was for none; I only feared his presence." At this moment Dr. Ostend entered, unbidden, and unnoticed by the Baron. Ernest was. the first to ob- serve him. Springing from the position he had taken, he advanced towards him, and whispered, "To the library, sir-I would have a word with you." The Confessor reluctantly followed. As the draw-. ing-room door was closed by Ernest, he deliberately locked it, and placed the key in his own pocket. "If intruders will enter unbidden," he remarked, , means must be taken to prevent it. If my father's life is taken, you are his murderer. "Go, Dr. Ostend, go. Meditate on all your vile deeds, and this, the crowning one, your treatment of your best friend. Go, fall at the footstool of mercy, the cross of Christ, perchance there may be mercy still for you. Sins of the deepest dye may be washed White as wool. On that alone your only hope depends. But come not under this roof again, or you will find that when I became a Christian I gave up no right as a man, and will soon show you that the arm of Ernest Vancleve is as ready as his spirit to punish the auda- city of Dr. Antoine Ostend."   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      879 The Confessor looked towards him in perfect astonishment, but answered nothing. Ernest, opening the hall door, said, c Go, sir, and save yourself forcible expulsion." One glance at the determined look of Ernest was sufficient, and darting out, he in a few moments was out of sight. "Would that I could have exercised this power long since," sighed Ernest, as he slowly unlocked the parlor door, after giving orders to John to admit no one, without first calling him or Dr. Weber. As he resumed his position beside his father, he heard him feebly mention the name of Mr. Ravens- croft. "Shall I call him, father?" he inquired. The Baron shook his head. "My mind, my son, is greatly disturbed. Would you could assist me." "Will you not go to Jesus, my beloved father." The head was again shaken. "My Holy Church forbids it, Ernest, yet every feeling prompts my flee- ing to the cross for salvation. I fear it is the device of Satan." "It is the teaching of the Holy Spirit, dearest father, open your heart to its blessed influence; it will show you the way, the truth, and the life. Shall Mr. Ravenscroft pray with you?" The head of the Baron was shaken violently. "Shall I then, dear father, or Dr. Baden) or Gus- tavus?" There was no answer; and the quivering face and     380     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. frothed mouth showed the disease .had returned with redoubled violence. It was of long continuance, and Adele had been carried away fainting, supposing it was his dying moment. He, however, again revived. Looking around anxiously, his eye met that of Ernest. He tried to speak. Ernest placed his ear close to him. He could only distinguish the words, " drawer- lock-open-Henriette-read." It was understood by Ernest in a moment. In a whisper he answered, "It shall be fitted with a key." A bright look expressed his father's pleasure for a moment; the next was succeeded by deep gloom. Ernest went to the furthest end of the room, entirely overcome. Gustavus was sitting at the foot of the bed. Lady Vancleve held her husband's hand, at- tempting, in vain, to conceal her emotion. She leaned over to wipe his brow, and again heard the name of Mr. Ravenscroft.  Dr.. Baden immediately' called him.  Walking quietly to the side of the bed, without addressing Baron Vancleve, he knelt; all followed his example. He prayed, yes, he truly prayed; he plead all the promises of God, in behalf of the sufferer; he asked the Spirit's guidance for li0m, that all darkness and prejudice should be re- moved, that light might break in upon his soul, and that in his dying moments he might give evidence to those around that his peace was made with God. His prayer was short and fervent. Only for his soul's salvation did he petition, not one for his recovery. He arose, and advancing to the bedside, took the   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      881 Baron's hand within his own, and said, with much emotion, "If you have taken Jesus for your friend, your only Mediator between God and man, will you not signify it by a pressure of my hand?" The hand was grasped firmly. Ernest wept aloud. "If you feel that Jesus is precious to you, that you have been enabled to roll your sins and sorrows upon the cross, raise your hand, in token of your entire trust." A beaming smile irradiated his face; his hand partly rose, and an effort was again made to speak. Then all was silent. Gustavus came forward, and placing the arm of Lady Vancleve within his, and the other abound her, he rather carried than led her to Adele's chamber. Ernest silently followed. Adele fully understood, and asking no questions, she placed her arms around the neck of her mother, and wept with her. The head of little Cassy had sought refuge in the bosom of Ernest, who, partly called away from self, was endeavouring to comfort her. Gustavus, knowing that his services would be needed, returned to the parlor, where Dr. Stuyvezant and Baron Kieft) who had not left the house, were awaiting his return, to offer their services and make arrangements respecting the body. Should the form be Catholic or Protestant, was the question. "That matter can only be decided by Lady Van-, cleve," said Gustavus, "and I cannot tell how we shall obtain her voice upon the subject. I know that she is much dissatisfied with Dr. Ostend of late, there- 33     382     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. fore Dr. Weisse would be preferred to officiate; but I scarcely think a Protestant burial would coincide with her views. She has desired me to advise her brother, Mr. Oberlin, by telegraph. He will probably be here to-morrow; we will let the matter rest with him. There has been some unpleasant feeling of late, regard- ing the children, and it would only add to his displea. sure to have a Protestant ceremony; which, after all, is a thing of very little moment." "I disagree with you entirely in that sentiment, Gustavus," replied Dr. Stuyvezant; "but it is a matter of so much moment, that we have no right to make a change without very clear evidence that it would meet the approval of the family." "Pardon me, Dr. Stuyvezant; when I spoke of the unimportance of the form, it was only in reference to the dead-the good or evil that would accrue to him in consequence. I should have made myself more fully understood." The following day brought Mr. and Mrs. Oberlin, who were much shocked at the sudden death of their relative. They had sullenly refused all intercourse, although full explanation had been made of the whole matter relative to their boys-merely replying, that in future they would place their little ones where they would be under other supervision than boys and pas- sionate servants. Mr. Oberlin, whose spirit was much subdued by the death of his brother-in-law, to whom he had been much attached, showed a willingness to please those   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     883 who differed widely from him in opinion; and though the Catholic form was to be observed, he made no objection to the proposal that Protestants should mingle with those of that faith, in the last rites of the Baron. Thursday morning arrived-the one on which Baron Vancleve was to be borne to his silent home. Numbers of the peasantry had collected, and groups might be seen conversing in a low tone, descanting on the virtues of the deceased. They were still flocking in, until they formed a dense mass for almost a square around. The chateau was filled with the gentry, whose carriages formed a line reaching nearly a mile. There had been the stillness of death for the last quarter of an hour, excepting here and there a stifled sob was heard. At length the large hall door was spread wide open. Every eye was fixed upon it with intense interest. President Stuyvezant, Baron Kieft, Dr. Baden, and Dr. Vonberg appeared, bearing in their hand the bier, on which was placed a plain, simple black coffin. The crowd immediately fell back, and in an instant a space was left wide enough for four to walk abreast. Dr. Weisse preceded the body. An immense procession issued from the house. The peasantry then followed four and four, forming a line that reached probably for miles. Remaining outside the chapel while the tedious ceremony was being per- formed, they again joined the procession as they moved towards the burial place. While a few Latin     384     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. words were repeated by Dr. Weisse, the body was laid beside the open grave. As he finished, the four gentlemen, silently raising it, lowered it into the grave. As a spade of dirt was thrown in, and sounded upon the lid, there was a general burst of grief. Lamentation and mourning, no longer sup- pressed, was heard on all sides. Every head re- mained uncovered, and no one moved from the grave. At length the sexton came forward and lifted the spade. Dr. Baden took it from his hands, and in a moment he and the three other gentlemen were busied filling it themselves. It was finished ere one stirred from the spot. Ernest clung to the arm of Gustavus for support. Among the gentry there was scarcely a dry eye, as they viewed this uncommon manifestation of respect, and, as they turned from the grave, there was one simultaneous burst from  the peasantry, "May God bless them for their kindness to our benefactor and our friend." Years after, Ernest or Gustavus could not mention this incident without emotion. The day after the interment of Baron Vancleve, the will was opened. Lady Vancleve was left execu- trix, associated with Mr. Oberlin as executor. As his stay was limited, it was necessary they should proceed at once to examine into the accounts, and as Ernest was entirely unfitted by his sad bereavement to render any assistance, Mr. Oberlin invited Dr. Weber to aid him. Every book was found kept in the most perfect   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERGo     385 order, showing Baron Vancleve a man of business; not a thaler spent but a note was made of it. "But what is this?" asked Gustavus, bringing to view a package on which was written in large letters, "Dr. Ostend."  It was opened by Mr. Oberlin. There was recognition of stock taken up to the amount of ten thousand thalers, and entrusted to Dr. Antoine Ostend for the immediate reparation of the church; nine thousand thalers given at different times the same year, at the earnest solicitation of the Holy Father, for various spiritual and temporal purposes. "Large donations, truly," exclaimed Mr. Oberlin; "if Father Antoine had not been the medium, I should fear imposition had been practised upon the generous and pliant nature of Baron Vancleve." "A worse almoner could scarcely have been cho- sen," replied Gustavus. "On what do you base that opinion?" replied Mr. Oberlin, colouring. "On close investigation, and know him to be a vile deceiver." Mr. Oberlin started.- "How far does Protestant prejudice influence you in that opinion?" "I am speaking only of his moral character. He has this year wrung money from his parishioners to the amount of ten thousand thalers, and fione know anything of its appropriation. Many of those poor beings were obliged to deprive themselves of food in order to meet his demands. I took all the names: of 33*     386     HEIGHTS OP EIDELBERG. those in poverty, and the amounts paid by them. I carried the list to Dr. Ostend, and threatened to ex- pose him, if there should be a recurrence. He has since execrated my very name." "You astonish me I the report of his sanctity has reached Brasburg." "Baron Vancleve has been his dupe for years," said Gustavus, "and I much fear his life has been the sacrifice of his perfidy." "I will sift it to the foundation," said Mr. Oberlin, much excited, "and if guilty he shall not go unpun- ished." He went out, and returned in about an hour. He had inquired diligently regarding the reparation of the church, for which had been expended during the last year just two hundred thalers, the gentlemen assuring him that this sum had been presented by Father Antoine from his own salary. No remark was made by Mr. Oberlin, but he left a message that he would he happy to see him at the chateau, on the forenoon of the next day. At the time appointed Dr. Ostend appeared. Mr. Oberlin received him in the library. "As a faithful minister of the Church, Mr. Ober- lin," he said, extending his hand to him, "I have come to soothe the sorrows of Lady Vancleve. Although I have felt much aggrieved of late, resent- ment is not in my nature." "The business for which I had desired to see you, Dr. Ostend," replied Mr. Oberlin, bowing very coldly, and declining his proffered hand, "was altogether of   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     387 a secular nature. As an executor of Baron Van- cleve, it is my duty to see that a proper disposition is made of his estate. Has the amount placed in your hands been used as directed?" As Mr. Oberlin spoke, he unfolded the memoran- dum and laid it before him. As the eye of Dr. Ostend rested upon it, he became exceedingly pale, his voice at first trembled, but soon recovering him- self, he said, with a sneer, A I was not aware that Baron Vancleve recorded his free-will offerings. Certainly he has lost his reward by so doing." "That is nothing to the purpose, at present, sir, I demand an account of your stewardship." "The money was forced upon me, much against my will, and I have expended the most of it in alms."  "You have then a most ungrateful parish, as they accuse you of being the recipient, rather than the benefactor. Was the ground on Elfin Heights, on which you have built, a free-will offering also?" "It was. The deed was sent me by the Baron, accompanied by a note asking my acceptance." "Indeed, then he has not recognized it. He says on the same paper, as you see, "Ground rented to Dr. Ostend." -If you refuse to do us justice, sir, I shall lay it before a committee of Bishops. If they decline, a civil court is my only resort."' ' Do your worst, Mr. Oberlin," said the Confessor, rising, and resuming the cloak he had thrown aside. "It is evident your mind has been poisoned, by     388     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. heretical influence." Bending over the table, in the attitude of prayer, for a few moments, he remained silent, then clasping his hands, and raising his eyes to heaven, he ejaculated: "O! Blessed Virgin, dis. abuse the mind of this misguided servant of the Church." Bowing low to Mr. Oberlin, he again ex- tended his hand. With an expression that probably was engraven on the memory of Dr. Ostend, Mr. Oberlin folded his arms, and replied: "The hand of Mr. Oberlin will never clasp that of a villain voluntarily." There was not a word of reply from the Confessor, but hastening from the room, Mr. Oberlin heard the hall door close after him. "Does your head still ache so violently, sister," said Mr. Oberlin, seating himself beside her couch, and endeavouring to regain his self possession. "The pain is much mitigated, brother; I have ob- tained some refreshing sleep." "Where is Dr. Weber?" he asked, "I thought he was with you." "He has just gone over the bridge, with Cassy Vandoren. Do not address him as Dr. Weber, he spoke of it, and seemed hurt." "I was rather at a loss what to call him. There is a dignity of manner that makes him appear much older than he really is. He is an honour to any family; I have seldom seen so elegant a young man. What address! what an intellect! and what principles I How sad he should be such a confirmed heretic."   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     389 "I thought with you until quite lately, brother, but this book," she added, laying her finger upon a small pocket Bible, "has taught me otherwise. He is not a heretic, but a true follower of the meek and lowly Saviour." Mr. Oberlin sprang to his feet--"' My dear sister!" he exclaimed, "in mercy to your soul, lay aside that sealed book. As you love me, as you love your own soul, as you love the Holy Mother, refrain from per- using its contents! Let me not lose my darling sister eternally. Will you not give me that book?" "All my estate, first, brother. This book belonged to Cora, and the dying request of Lorenzo was, that I should make it the man of my counsel. It is now my solace, in this trying hour, and will enlighten my path, even through the dark valley. Read it your- self, brother, you will never regret it." "Never! never!" he exclaimed. "Here, by your side, in the name of everything that is sacred, I sol- emnly declare that whatever may be the temptation, I never will give way to it, or read one word in that book, which has destroyed the souls of so many near and dear to me. Let us never again name the sub- ject, dear sister; it will only be a fruitless source of contention between us." Hearing the voice of Gustavus below, he went down to consult him regarding the steps to be taken with Dr. Ostend. "We will examine the papers more thoroughly," said Gustavus, "the turns of law are various."     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. Turning to the table to get them, what was Mr. Oberlin's surprise to find them gone. Every book was lifted, and the room searched in vain. "That notable villain has them!" exclaimed Mr. Oberlin, stamping his foot; "he is the devil himself in stratagem." "Let us at once obtain an officer to arrest him," replied Gustavus, reaching the hat of Mr. Oberlin from the stand, and placing his own upon his head. A fruitless visit was made to the burgomaster, who only shrugged his shoulders, and leisurely seating himself, between the whiffs of his pipe, assured them that his temerity was not quite equal to aiding in the apprehension of the Holy Father. Finding him im- movable, they proceeded to the study of Dr. Ostend. Mr. Oberlin, greatly excited, accused him at once of the theft. " Those papers were taken by you, Dr. Ostend, and shall be delivered to their rightful owners." The Holy Father's face assumed a look of horror; raising his eyes, and clasping his hands together, he exclaimed, "No one can now remain in that house of Belial-that charnel-house, filled with dead men's bones, and all uncleanness-without showing a cloven foot before they leave it. Begone, miscreant, lest the air of my sanctum should be contaminated with your presence." As he finished, he turned to leave the room. Mr. Oberlin sprang forward, and seizing him by the collar, took from the table a small riding whip, and half a   dozen strokes were given, ere his loud cries for help were answered by a man-servant, who appeared at the opposite door. "Come near, you varlet," cried Mr. Oberlin, now completely roused, " and you will sorely repent it." The man cowered, and shrank into a corner of the room. A close observer might have seen something very like pleasure on the countenance of Dr. Weber, who, with folded arms, stood silently viewing the whole scene. At length, completely tired, Mr. Oberlin released his hold, saying, - If the law had done its duty, I should not have sullied my hands with this castiga- tion. If you had been a gentleman, I could have dealt with you as such." Without making a word of answer, Dr. Ostend dis- appeared, and the gentlemen left the study. "I certainly should not have thought of such signal vengeance," said Gustavus, laughing heartily, "nor would I have inflicted it; but I confess I had no great inclination to rescue the weaker party." Mr. Oberlin joined in the laugh, and they soon afterwards reached the chateau. In the afternoon they went to view the house built by Dr. Ostend, on the lot which he professed to own on Elfin Heights. It was a fine building, costing probably not less than twenty thousand thalers. As they were returning, towards dusk, theywere surprised to see: groups of peasantry collecting here and there,     392     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG, who, as they drew near them, would immediately scatter. Gustavus asked the cause, but received an evasive answer. After making inquiries several times, he at length discovered there was some excitement relative to Dr. Ostend. There had been some whisper that Baron Vancleve had not lived out the full mea- sure of his days, and as many of them had been over- reached by him also, Gustavus feared there might be some outhreak, and did not leave the ground until they were all dispersed, and he returned home, satis- fied that the danger, for the present at least, was over. In the night, however, a loud cry of fire was heard, and, in two hours, the dwelling of Dr. Ostend was burned to the ground. From that night the Holy Father never again made his appearance in Eidelberg. Of his residence none knew for a length of time, until a piece appeared in the "Ghostly Counsellor," a paper edited by Father Basil, stating that the martyr, Dr. Antoine Ostend, had found a resting place in the monastery of St. Anthony, and had been chosen as their abbot. Mr. Oberlin, at the request of Lady Vancleve, made the most strenuous efforts to discover the insti- gators of this lawless act, but no one was found to give the slightest information, and the secret re- mained with those concerned. After remaining a month at the chateau, Mr. and Mrs. Oberlin reluctantly took leave, promising, the following summer, if possible, to repeat their visit. "Time is rapidly passing," said Dr. Weber to his 4   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     398 wife, "I feel that I should be among my people; I am not doing my duty, remaining here." "I long to see my future home, Gustavus," she re- plied, " but how can I leave mamma and Ernest?" "We will try to obtain their consent to accompany us. The change of scene would certainly benefit them." Lady Vancleve at first resisted -every appeal, but finding Ernest desired a change, she finally consented to make them a short visit, and on the following week the whole family set out, accompanied by Presi- dent Stuyvezant, who had promised Gustavus a visit of a few weeks before he returned to his charge at Kendoran. When they arrived within a few miles of the chateau, many of the peasantry, in their best dresses, came to meet them, and their happy faces and hearty cheers produced quite an exhilarating effect on the whole party. Gustavus sprang from the carriage, and was at once surrounded by the whole group, expressing their pleasure at his return in va- rious ways. The simple and devoted affection they manifested for her husband affected Adele to. tears, and before she reached the house she felt as much at home as though it had been her birth-place. "I suppose this is Mrs. Volkmar?" she remarked, as they drove into the carriage way, and a pleasant looking old lady came down the avenue to receive them; 'her very appearance would command both respect and love." -34     894     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. Mrs. Yolkmar was the widow of a Hungarian officer, who lost his life in endeavouring to achieve the independence of his country; and she, an alien from her home, was obliged to seek a maintenance in a foreign land. Giving them a courteous reception, she escorted them to the drawing-room, while Gustavus remained behind to shake hands with those of his people whom he had not seen, and he fully realized the words of the poet: "Absence strengthens friendship, when the parting is kindly." At the close of that day, Gustavus, with a heart overflowing with gratitude, gathered his household, and, on bended knee, commended them to the favour of the Almighty, and consecrated himself anew to his service. Lady Vancleve was present for the first time. Since the death of Baron Vancleve her Bible had been her constant companion; but neither Ernest nor Gustavus felt themselves at liberty to establish family worship publicly at the chateau, always holding .a little service in the chamber of Adele; and a feeling, which she could scarcely define, prevented her uniting with them in this sacred duty. "Truly," exclaimed Gustavus, as he closed his chamber door, "I have been led in a way that I know not. When I thought my day-star had almost set, and dark clouds enveloped me, God mercifully point. ed to his bow of promise, on which I fixed my eye,   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     395 and I may now say, my head is anointed with the oil of gladness, and my cup runneth over." A look of love was the only reply of Adele. It was enough, and imprinting a kiss upon her cheek, he retired to rest, peaceful and happy. CHAPTER XIV. "Every end is happiness, The glorious consummation of design." "ONLY three months and Elsie returns to us" ex- claimed Cassy Vandoren, one bright spring morning, as Carl and she were preparing the ground for seed, and cutting off the redundant branches from the vines and bushes. "She loves gardening as well as I do; we shall have pleasant times together." "Likely," replied Carl, turning his face towards her, c" how many days do you believe Ernest Vancleve will leave her with us, Cassy?" "I forgot his claim, for the minute. O well, she will be happy, and we get along very delightfully, I am sure; and we can have her with us very often, at all events." "Of course, daily, I hope, and to know that my cousins are equally well situated will be a subject of thankfulness'I have been waiting for several years, You are happy, Cassy?" "As far, dear Carl, as a happy home and dear, sr     396     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. dear, friends, can promote happiness; but, can a Chris- tian pilgrim be entirely happy, with a knowledge of the evils of the heart, Carl?" "No, not with such as mine, Cassy; but I have been inclined to doubt that you had much trouble with that plague of humanity, you are always so bright, and so kind-so exactly what I lov e you to be." "Very easy to be all my friends desire, if those very friends exert all their powers to make my path smooth, and allow nothing to interfere with my plea- sure--never annoyed in the slightest. Uncle, mother, and you especially, shielding me always from anything that might be adverse to my comfort: notwithstand- ing, I have to grieve, and pray over many, many, be- setting frailties. It is queer, Carl-I had the same thoughts of your exemption from the troubles of an evil heart." A heavy sigh escaped him, but he replied in a cheerful voice, "My cousin Cassy Vandoren would be the last person I would confess to." He took the seed from her hand and planted them. Theresa appeared, to say that breakfast was ready. The prospects of Elsie were discussed at the table. Mr. Ravenscroft informed them that "the young Baron had been already to make arrangements with him about their union, which he wished to take place, if he could persuade Elsie, the day after she was eighteen." Carl looked at Cassy, and whispered, "I told you as much."   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      .397 "t He gave as one reason," continued Mr. Ravens- croft, " that Cassy being at school, and Lady Weber so far away, his mother was left without a female com- panion; besides, he thought I'he had tarried a good while for Miss Vonbergs notions.'  "Better let things take their natural course, bro- ther," replied Mrs. Vandoren. "We desired to have Elsie with us a month, before her marriage; but Van- cleves are never unreasonable, and we shall see her constantly." "Not a doubt of that, aunt Meggie," said Carl. "Will you sail to-day, Cassy? I am to see some patients up the river." "It would be just as convenient, Carl, and more delightful, to ride along the banks. Gentle has not had the saddle on for three days; she will lose her right to the title, I fear." "Horses, then, if you say so, Cassy. Can you be ready as soon as they?" "Sooner," she replied, laying her hand -on his fore- head, and giving his head a shake as she passed Mm; "you know I can, saucy Car]." He tried to catch her, but she eluded him, and returned in a very few minutes, dressed in a riding. habit and cap. ': Who is tardy, Dr. Ravenscroft, and where are the horses?' Carl started. 'Why, are you ready? I did not expect you in less than fifteen minutes." "'I will sit with uncle in his study, while you are preparing." 34*     398     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "Well, do; but take off that fur, it is too warm in the study for it." His cousin smiled, as she unhooked the tippet. "Did you ever see the river look more beautiful, Carl? It is like melted glass."  "It does; I am glad you proposed riding, though I preferred the Sea-Bird, before we came out." "I was afraid Gentle would become frisky; she is already a little unruly. But, Carl, I do wish you would sometimes thwart me a little, and take your preferences." "As in this instance, Cassy, I am usually the gainer by giving. way to your inclinations. This world, too, is so full of thwarts, that we need not create them for each other." "My career has been wonderfully smooth, Carl." "And have not Imuch subject for thankfulness, Cassy? Could my home be improved?" "I have occasionally thought you might think so, during your visit to Spain this summer, and introduce from there a very charming Mrs. Dr. Ravenscroft." Carl drew in his reins a little, and placed his horse immediately before that of his cousin, giving himself a full view of her countenance. "Would you be per- fectly satisfied with such an addition to our home circle?" he asked her, deliberately and distinctly. "The bounden duty of the whole household would be, to receive our new relative with cordiality, and in every possible way augment her happiness," replied Cassy, half seriously.   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      399 "You know I would never add a member to our family fireside, without the advice and approval of my father and your mother; but that is not my question, Cassy. Is it possible that you, who have been my constant companion so many years-walking, sailing, riding, visiting, reading, practising our music toge- ther, praying with each other-tell me frankly, could you be satisfied that another should take your place, Cassy?"He fixed his eyes earnestly, almost reproach- fully, on her face, as he awaited her reply. The cheek of his companion became pale as she answered, "It is a subject, Carl, I have always turned from. I know it must be some time; and I acknow- ledge it, I should feel selfishly jealous to be supplant- ed." She tried to laugh, but tears prevented her.  Carl returned to her side, and they silently pur- sued their way until they came upon the hamlet where a patient resided. Here he checked his horse, and laying his hand on the reins of hers, he said solemnly, "My own Cassy, here by the side of this murmuring stream, among these hills and rocks, be- fore high Heaven I sacredly promise, while you live, and live Cassy Vandoren, never will I change my con- dition in life; and in this promise, declare to you I make no self-sacrifice ;-is the fetter of France re- quired?" he added, releasing her bridle, and drawing a ring from his finger. "No, no, Carl," replied his cousin, nor would I permit you to make the promise, had you not said it was no sacrifice."     400     HEIGHTS OP EIDELBERG. "To leave such a home as mine, Cassy, is a sacri- fice, but duty imperatively calls me; I am going to tell my own mother's relatives of the Redeemer in whom she believed-in whom her son believes-and to offer to them the same Saviour, the only Mediator. Shall I, a soldier of the cross, shrink from my plain duty? Dr. Baden will attend to my patients; I ex- pect to return in time for the wedding of Elsie." "I always feel in parting with a friend," replied Cassy, "how much may transpire in their absence; it is a changing, eventful world; we cannot expect to be carried through it on 'flowery beds of ease;' yet, Carl, how blissful the reflection, should our home circle be broken, each of us has an assured hope of a blessed immortality." "I know it, Cassy, a glorious home is prepared for every child of grace, the survivors only are the suf- ferers." "Yet a little while, and all will meet where parting is no more, Carl. I have to remember this when I look upon mother and uncle Eldrid; yet you, dearer than either, may be taken first." "Or you, my own Cassy, what would this world be to me without you?" "A wilderness; as it would be to me separated from you, Carl; but the voice of the Shepherd dis- solves all earthly enchantments. "Gladly leaving all below, Jesus we would follow thee."   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     401 The voice of Carl faltered, and his lip quivered, as he said, "Your expressions have sometimes induced me to think you would not be unwilling to exchange your earthly for a heavenly home, Casey, much as you are beloved here." She turned her beaming face full upon Carl, and replied, "You know I love you all dearly, fervently; but what is a terrestrial paradise compared with that glorious abode--dropping her reins, and clasping her hands together, without noticing where the horse stood, his foot slipped, and before she could recover the bridle, or Carl saw the danger, she, with Gentle, was thrown over the precipice. Carl flung himself from his horse, and reckless of the imminent risk, plunged over the rocks to the spot where his cousin lay senseless. With presence of mind remarkably his own, he removed her fur and cap; then filling his from the stream, bathed her head and face. Language cannot portray the inten- sity of his anguish when he found no sign of return- ing consciousness. He was only a short interval alone; for the Arab of Dr. Ravenscroft, without a rider, running along the road, gave great alarm; and the people ran in every direction to offer their assistance to their much respected young physician. Cassy was carried by two peasants to a cottage. Dr. Baden arrived incredibly soon, and he despatched a note to the manse, saying, Cassy Vandoren had been hurt by a fall from her horse, and could not      402     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. ride home at present, but that he would see her there in an hour." A bed was placed for the body of Cassy in a covered wagon, followed by Dr. Baden, and the distracted Carl in a carriage. As no one at the manse was aware of the fatal result, all that might be exciting to the supposed sufferer was carefully avoided. Her mother, with Elsie and her uncle, walked quietly up stairs after Dr. Baden, and some other friends had made previous arrangements. "Do not forbid me, dear Doctor," said Mrs. Van- doren, wringing her hands, as he gently opposed her entrance, and tried to lead her towards the adjoining room, "I must come to my child." Mr. Ravenscroft stood an instant only by the side of the bed, and before Elsie had reached it, he put his arm round her and turned away. Dr. Baden followed with Mrs. Vandoren, whom he had soothingly persuaded it would be best. "Be composed, my dear Mrs. Vandoren," said the kind Doctor, "she would not recognize you; we will do all that is requisite for her." "Tell me candidly, Doctor, how is it with my child? will she recover?" "It is well with her, my dear friend, it is well with her." "Is she-will she die, Doctor-O! tell me of my child-tell me!" There was silence a short time. Dr. Baden took   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     403 both her hands in his, and said softly, "She has passed into glory." The head of the childless widow fell upon the bosom of the Doctor. He lifted her upon the bed; swoon succeeded swoon for some hours; and when sub. dued, anodynes were necessary to calm her violent agitation. But she was sustained; and sat calmly the second day after, at the side of her daughter, occasionally stroking the glossy brown hair, as it lay parted upon the marble forehead. Elsie knelt weep. ing by her aunt. Mr. Ravenscroft stood on the other side, grief personified. Carl, pale and sorrow-worn, with folded arms, bent over the coffin, intently gazing on the same beaming countenance that had turned upon him, as she stood at the portals of heaven. The radiant face seemed to upbraid their mourning for one who had attained immortal blessedness. The same mourners were around her last resting- place, attended by very many sorrowing and sympa- thizing fiiends, and many, too, on whose hearts the departed had "carved numberless good deeds." The agony of the mother was tearless. Elsie sat on the next grave bathed in a flood of grief. He who had always been first to soothe her distresses, stood there also, but she was unnoticed, and all else; his suppressd sobs more than once occasioned the voice of the speaker to falter. Ernest and Dr. Baden supported Mrs. Vandoren to her carriage. Carl now observing Elsie, was about to take her away, when Bertrand, without speaking a     404     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. word, lifted her up, and carried her to her aunt. Carl, with his father, remained a few minutes by the side of the open grave; as others dispersed they, too, turned away, leaving her to sleep on till the first resurrection. But ever after, the flowers of spring and autumn told of the loving heart, and unwearied hands that planted and trained them, until in beauty no plot in Evendale cemetery could compare with it. Sympathy is soothing, and time will in a measure heal the keenest sorrows. The family at the manse were sad, sad indeed, but never murmuring. Carl was occupied almost constantly; his practice, owing to the avowed wish of Dr. Baden to retire, was in- creasing daily, and no one ever better filled their niche. He was welcomed with a smile at every bed- side, having a comforting word for all the suffering. He had a smile for the rejoicing, and a tear for the sorrowing; he could pray with the sick and the dying, and none could better give consolation to the mourning.  He was venerated by the poor, and admired by the gentry. Indeed, he was called "the beloved physician," he neglected none. Dr. Ravens- croft was always at his post. No night was toodreary, no storm too pitiless, to prevent his obeying a call to the couch of an invalid, be it ever so humble. Mrs. Vandoren, too, was unremitting in her exertions; many who would have suffered from cold and hunger, were relieved by her active benevolence. Frequently she would accompany Carl in his rounds, and ascer-   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      405 tain the pecuniary condition of the peasantry, and contribute to their necessities. The return of Elsie to the home of her child- hood did much to mitigate their sadness. Ernest cheerfully asented to her remaining six months at the manse. "I feel we are selfish, my son, to allow you Wto consent to Elsie's request, but she will be such a com- fort to us." "That is my reward, dear Mr. Ravenseroft," re- turned Ernest. "Where is Carl, sir?" Gone with some eglantine roots to Evendale; that is his recreation, after the fatigue of the day. ie will return presently. Poor boy." "Always alone, I believe sir?" "Always.  Bertrand-once offered to water the plot every morbng, but he declined his services. Being of a pensive, meditative spirit, I fear it will become morbid. He never names his cousin, but comes in sometimes sick from Evendale, no doubt, from unrestrained weeping. A heavy trial, Ernest, though we know He never afflicts willingly, and all things will work together for our good." The warm heart of the young Baron felt deeply for the bereft, but he could not trust himself to give utterance to a word. Mr. Ravenscroft saw it, and inquired if the Vonberg chateau were really under arrest. "It is, and will be sold shortly. Dr. Vonberg has the offer of a Professorship in southern Germany, of 35     406     HEIGHTS OP EIDELBERG. greater emolument than his Presidency, which he will accept." "The Doctor has called often, but Annette we sel- dom see; she believes herself unfitted to bear the sadness of our house, her nervousness is so much in- creased by a visit to us. The religion she has chosen has not much sustaining power, Ernest." "None, sir. My father's family can all speak from experience; and my little sister Cassy has not a ves- tige of Romanism left upon her mind." Mrs. Vandoren, who had been with Elsie, arrang- ing her sleeping apartment, now joined them. "I cannot find words to thank you, Baron Vancleve." "Ernest-dear Mrs. Vandoren, do not give me any other title, I beg." "Ernest, then, it shall be in future, my dear. I am so grateful for the comfort of our dear Elsie, a little while." "I am afraid I shall not know how to deprive you of her at the end of six months; but she will be here daily, then. I really do believe I am only second to aunt Meggy and uncle Eldrid, with her now." "You believe no such thing, Dominie Vancleve," exclaimed Elsie, catching his last words as she entered the door; " you know all are exactly on a line in my heart, and cousin Carl not a whit behind the rest." "We are all entirely satisfied, dear," said her uncle, kissing her as she seated herself on a, low chair close beside him; "we full well know you sincerely love us all-have you seen Carl?"   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     407 "He brought me home, you know, uncle." Yes-but since." "No; Bertrand says he came, and finding a mes- sage for him, he had Arab saddled, and went over to Eidelberg." "You have decidedly declined the offer of St. Paul's pulpit, have you not, Ernest?" "Yes, sir; I hope to spend my life in the College Chapel. It has ever been a matter of wonder to me, how a clergyman could leave his first charge, espe- cially for increase of salary." "To you, that is a matter of little importance, but sometimes their churches do not very amply support their dominies; although we ought to be slow to change-if possible, to remain." "The College proposes erecting a larger house for the accommodation of summer travellers, on the site of our present one. I do not think I could exalt my. self by changing, if that were my object. I have the advantage of being a converted Romanist, which induces the students of St. Gabriel's to come in con- stantly."           - "Is that allowed, Ernest?" inquired Elsie.  "The officers of St. Gabriel's find it better policy to pass many things unnoticed for which formerly the students would have been dismissed." Carl came home toward evening in better spirits than usual, owing to the reeove'ry of a little boy about whom he had been extremely anxious several weeks.     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. " Yours is an anxious life, dear," observed Mrs. Vandoren. "Yes, aunt Meggy, it has its shadows; but the improvement or restoration of a patient is a delight exclusively the physician's. I would select the same, were I again to begin life." The evening, like the many that succeeded, passed profitably at the manse. "I have been here nearly six months, aunt Meggy; how the days have flown since I left the chateau. Dr. Weber and Adele have come; Dr. Vonberg and mamma, at Lady Vancleve's invitation, will stay there, and are expected to.morrow." " Your uncle has a note from Dr. Vonberg, request. ing the privilege, as your mother's husband, of giving you away. Do not oppose it, my dear," seeing the eye of Elsie flash-" he is right; he is nominally your father, and it will appear better so. If I desire it, my Elsie will consent," she added, folding her in her arms. "I wish nothing contrary to your will, aunt Meggy," replied the affectionate girl, ardently re- turning her caresses. All were busy preparing for the reception of the youthful bride at the chateau. The sun of her last day at the manse had arisen-the day she was to be led to the altar by Baron Vancleve. Since the death of his father there had not been such an appearance of life and animation at the chateau. Lady Vancleve really looked bright, as she gave her directions for   various arrangements; and her children rejoiced as they observed her light footstep and cheerful spirits when the hour arrived, and the carriages which were to eonvey them to Mr. Ravenseroft's. In consequence of existing circumstances, few guests were invited beside the relatives. President Stuyvezant, now Do- minie, Mr. and Mrs. Weberstadt, Dr. Baden and his son Philip, Lewellyn Bryant, Captain and Mrs. Blu- cher, and the domestics of the two families, only were present. Elsie slightly changed colour, as her mother took the arm of Ernest, and Dr. Vonberg presented his to enter the room with her. Carl stood by the side of Ernest, and Cassy, at her own request, as the hand- maiden of Elsie. The day was passed at the manse. No one witnessed the parting of Elsie with her uncle and aunt. Ernest gently unclasped her arms from the neck of Carl, saying, playfully, She is trying to make me jealous, Doctor, but she will not." "I will be back every day, Carl, indeed I will," she said, half laughing through her tears, as her cousin, after an evident struggle, released her; and placing her hand in that of Ernest, he whispered, "Take her--cherish her, love her, as I have all her life, and may God bless you." The carriage rolled away. Time rolled on.   The years of Dr. Ravenscroft became to him a pleasant monotony. Elsie, faithful to her promise, whenever it was possible, was a daily- visitor at the manse. 35*    "O     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "Carl has declined breakfasting here to-morrow," said Elsie, handing her husband a note; "he writes he will next day, but has no time, nor taste for gene- ral society. With all your influence, Ernest, cannot you induce him to go out at all? He is so admired, so much esteemed throughout the whole country. We all still mourn for our dear cousin, but his grief is as though her death were yesterday; his sole en- joyment is at that grave. Does he ever mention her to you, Ernest?" "Never; and there has been an interval of five years. He is deaf to all my expostulations, to accept some of the numerous invitations he receives. Ex- cepting as a physician, he visits but four families, including our own." "True, and if his Sea-Bird is required to take visi- tors home, when the ride would be long and tiresome, he excuses himself professionally, and with his natural tact, sends Bertrand. Thousand pities he should not settle in life. Carl would make the best husband in the world." "Save one," returned Elsie, with a bright smile. "I am quite willing to accord with you there, but Carl might readily engage the affections of the love- liest in the land." "He did, Ernest, and lost her. There are none left to compare with Cassy Vandoren." "True, indeed," replied the Dominie, with a heavy sigh; "but he was perfectly convinced of the impossi- bility of their union, they were so nearly related."   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     4" "Yes, but Cassy would not have accepted the addresses of an emperor. Carl's worth would out- weigh the brilliance of a crown, and his marriage have been equally distressing to her." "Even his music is neglected; except at morning and evening worship, not a note is heard at the manse. I am to meet my deacons, shall I send Carl to see Lorenzo? he seems drooping to-day." "No; he saw him yesterday at the manse. He told me then nothing ailed him but his mother's fears, and too much sugar candy. Carl says, that if all children were prohibited candy before dinner, and a very trifling portion after, this would be a far more healthy generation." Ernest, laughing, said "they must profit by the prescription;" and after a little more talk about the boy, went out. Season came and went, making little change in any of the families belonging to the Heights. Carl reading in the evening, to his aunt when alone, or when occu- pied with company, passed it in his father's study. It was a cold, December evening, that Dr. Ravens- croft was called to the dying bed of a poor man at Eidelberg. "He desired you would come over with me, father. Can you brave the storm?" "I braved a worse storm in my frantic anxiety for you, my son, eleven years ago. My parishioners are my children. I would not dare refuse." Bertrand came in from a messenger to say that John Heisse was dead.     "2     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. There had been a long interval of silence, when Mr. Ravenscroft said, in a calm low voice, "Carl." Carl lifted his eyes from his book, and looked in- quiringly. "You have arrived at the very height of your pro- fession, my son, and are nearly twenty-eight years of age; have you ever reflected that in the roll of time your aunt and your father will be'advancing in years, and according to the decrees of nature, my pulpit and my seat here will be vacant, and she, who might be your solace, in a little while, will also be numbered among the departed. I have often, very often, re- flected on the lone, desolate situation of my only, my beloved son. I could leave this world without sor- row, could I previously see you settled in life. I would not select for you, Carl, but surely there is one whom you might find attractive and whom you might persuade to make life a blessing to yourself, and a comfort to the remnant of my days." Carl heard every word without again raising his eyes; he then replied, with a deep sigh, "My father asks an impossibility of his son; my heart lies buried up by the side of yours, father, at Evendale." "She left me her son to fill that void. What have you, when your aunt and I are taken?" "The recollection of your virtues, and the blessed anticipation of a re-union, my father." "Enough, Carl, that subject shall never be touched upon again."   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.     413 A sad, almost bitter smile, and a low "thank you father," was the reply. The earth will revolve, despite the instability of hu- manity; and though there were changes in Eiseldorf and Eidelberg, the family at the manse still nurm- bered three. The boys of Elsie were constant visit- ors there, and were a source of great enjoyment to them all. "Aunt Cassy is coming home to stay with us all winter," said little Eldrid. "We are all glad," added Lorenzo, "they will all be here on my birth day. I shall be eight next day after to-morrow." "And I am going on six, uncle Doctor," said Eldrid, seating himself on the knee Carl had placed for him. Lorenzo whispered in his uncle's ear, "he was only five yesterday." "Your aunt will think you quite old boys; I hope she will think you pretty clever." "We can both read, and I can write pretty well. That is being pretty clever, isn't it, uncle? I want to tell you,"' he continued, "lowering his voice; "father says aunt Cassy puts him in mind of aunt Meggy's daughter who died a great, great many years ago, before any of us were born.  Hush! Don't let aunt Meggy hear us. Do you remember her, uncle Doctor?" Carl nodded, and taking out his watch, asked Eldrid if he could tell the time?     "4     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. In a few days the family at the manse crossed the river to welcome Dr. Weber, his wife, and their little friend Cassy, to Eidelberg. She had indeed grown; the resemblance to Cassy Vandoren was very appa- rent, but of course not remarked upon. Her visits to Eidelberg had been very few and short, having spent her summer vacations with her mother at the chateau of Dr. Weber. "Can it be possible that young lady is only eighteen?" said Mr. Ravenscroft. "If I did not remember the day of her birth," re- plied Mrs. Vandoren, "I certainly should suppose her to be at least five and twenty; yet she is precisely what her childhood promised-what a delightful com- panion she will be for Elsie." She was; and, in course of time, to Mrs. Vandoren too. Often she would carry with her her sewing, and sit the morning, while the Dominie and the Doctor were occupied with their parishioners and patients. They visited the poor together, and Cassy appointed an hour each day to read the Bible to those who were unable. Unlike any other of her family, Cassy Van- cleve had been nurtured on the lap of Protestantism; she had had none of the superstitious errors or false doctrines of the Romanist to overcome, and as she grew it was in favour with God and man. Cassy was in- deed an "Israelite in whom there was no guile." "k I do wish," she said one day, as they were sitting together, "I might call you aunt Meggy; I am the only one obliged to say Mrs. Vandoren. The few   HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG.      415 months I have been home I have learned to regard you as an aunt-have I your consent?" "4Full and free, my dear; I have had you so much with me, I really feel very little difference between you and Elsie, and will 4be glad to add you to my list of nieces," replied Mrs. Vandoren, affectionately kiss- ing her. "Sister has sent for me to pass the summer there, but I really have become so interested in my Sunday- school and my poor families, I do not think it well to leave them; yet sister Adele and the Doctor are so urgent-what would you advise, aunt Meggy?" "I fear I would advise selfishly; I shall miss you so myself.  You must be guided by your mother, my dear; I must not judge for you, indeed." "Mamma throws me on my own judgment. Bro. ther, and Elsie, like yourself, wish me to remain here. I hope I shall be guided to do what is best." She was saying " good-by" to Mrs. Vandoren, when Carl came in. After the salutations of the day, he said, "Unless you prefer walking over the bridge, Miss Vancleve, I  will take pleasure in rowing you over the Niese." "My preference should not permit me to tax your courtesy, Dr. Ravenscroft, "especially so near your dinner hour."  "Remain with us, my- dear, and I  will accompany you; I  would like to consult them all regarding your leaving us," said Mr. Ravenscroft.     "6     HEIGHTS OF EIDELBERG. "Do you expect to leave Eidelberg, Miss Van- cleve?" asked Carl, with interest. "My sister is desirous I should be with her in the summer; my going is at my own option-to choose is my difficulty-no one will advise me." "I supposed your stay among us would be perma- nent, and said so at the time of the election of the superintendent. That office will be again left vacant, a department always difficult to fill; what is the opinion of your brother, Dominie Vancleve?" "Ernest says his personal feelings are too much interested, I must decide myself, I trust I may satis- factorily." "The duty to remain appears to me Very clear, Miss Vancleve, unless Lady Weber's claim is very positive, pardon my interference." "I so much desired your opinion, but did not like to ask it," replied Cassy, colouring, "I will write your views to sister Adele. I know they will have weight with her." Not only this time, but frequently the "Sea-Bird" was observed bearing the beautiful Miss Vancleve from one landing to the other, and occasionally the little skiff was seen gliding over the bay, a very colla- teral way to Point Rock. "Have you not observed some very remarkable fea- tures in the character of Miss Vancleve, Meggy?" asked the Dominie, as they sat alone one evening in his study, "are there not many very striking peculi- arities."   HEIGHTS OP EIDELBERG.      417 "Resemblances, youwould say, Eldred. I have; and find as strong traits, as similar in character and dispo- sition, as in name. I could scarcely control myself in church when she sang; it was the very voice of my child. I really have so associated them, that the spirit of my daughter seems to be hovering near, when she is with me; and Carl is certainly interested in her; do you not notice, brother, how differently he receives her from all other ladies?" "His interest is very apparent to me, Meggy, and if Carl should feel towards her as you suppose, and should add her a link to our family chain, could you bear it Meggy, my dear sister?" "Eldred, I firmly believe she has providentially been brought among us, to-fill that dreadful breach made ten years since in our circle. I have been watching them anxiously, and will rejoice in such an event. My whole heart yearns over Cassy Vaneleve; she is the only being on earth I could call daughter." "And will, Meggy; your assent only was wanting. Carl has told her himself his sorrowful story; has con- fessed to her that he loved her at first because of her resemblance in name, voice, manner, disposition, and character, to Cassy Vandoren, but now-he loved her for her own sake. He expressed very much your idea, Meggy, when he said, had the two Cassys not lived on earth at the same time, it might be an argu- ment for the transmigration of souls, they were so alike. Mrs. Vancleve rejoices in the prospect of such a son. I spoke to her of the disparity in their ages. 86     "8     HEIRGHTS OF EIDELBERG. She thought that hardly perceptible, observing that my son looked so young, and her daughter has so matured a mind. No one has spoken since of it; but Carl is coming, Meggy, I will leave you."
