INTRODUCTORY SKETCH.     Ilidde his face is, He is dead; Hushed the place is, Over his head; Lush the grass is, On his bed; Thick wi' daisies, Ye turfe is spread; Every trace is Quickly fled, Of the graces In him ybred; Ah, his race is Too soone sped. Dwrke his face is, Alas I he's dead. Rude and chafing were the checks, * His high hearte of youth did vex; And the home that should been warme, Chilled him like a colde March storm.   T . .. THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. INTRODUCTORY    SKETCH. I. REGINALD WARE is dead! His eyes that greeted mine so often, and never but with brotherly affection, are closed to earthly scenes and now turn their greetings to the iheavenly. His hand that met mine so often, in the firm andgetitle clasp of manly friendship, now lies cold Upon a plse- less breast. His form is begir with at linging ves- tare which, alas, can impart no warmth. A:bt hi. close, straight and grim, the walls of his-narrow ou e.  Above him, the moist stones and the troddentlay lie     "  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. heavily-but a little higher than these, the creeping grasses are growing green, the daisies are growing gay; and still a little higher, the elm-tTee branches sway forward and backward in the west wind; and yet a little higher the winged birds and the winged clouds come and go the live long day through the happy sky; while, highest of all and glorifying all, the round sun rolls over in his appointed course, and the crescent moon-gentle shepherdess--leads forth her golden- fleeced flock of stars. S., meetly, he takes his unperturbed rest. Fitful and frightful agitations will shake the living world, but he, lying six feet below the valley-turf, will remain un- shocked and absolute forever. Succeeding springs will come and sow the sod above him, and answering flowers will grow tall and wave in the tarrying zephyrs like angel-swung censers of richest perfume. The hum of wandering bees and the vernal murmurs of the near- by wood, will temper the smiting splendors of the sum- mer solstice. The haze-dim light of waning autumn, wreathing its listless moods in dreamy shapes, will hang long and lingeringly around his resting-place; and the wild blasts of the winter-nights will wail above his buried manhood, until wails and dirges, and Time too, which will not outlive these, shall be no more. But my dirge has been sung. In another fashion I have said over the sleeper my mournful requiem. It   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       15 is not here that I would awake again the echoes of the expired strain, nor now that I would weave, in elegaic phrase, my utterances of grief for the departed. With this, dear reader, yourself have naught to do. Nor would the name of my deceased friend thus have fur- nished the initial words of this volume, but that his approaching death occasioned the committal to my hands of the materials from which the work is ampli- fled; materials already so ample and so complete, that my task in preparing them for the press, is hardly more than that of a collator, or at the most-as I beg the reader to suppose-that of an editor. I should, however, feel but indifferently discharged of all obligation, if I should omit to give some account of the origin of certain manuscripts, which form a very considerable portion of the materials mentioned. And it accords well both with my conception of the duties of my office, and with my inclination as a friend, to preface such account with a sketch-drawn briefly, in merest outline-strokes--of the fortunes of this man to- whom was confided the childhood of our heroine; who formed, with tender and tireless care, the plastic mind of the child into the sweet and noble character of the true woman; who flung out with the enhancements of ardent portrayal, before the enamored girlish fancy, the rich-tinted fields of literature, and then led the sweet wonderer, with judicious guidance, through the     16   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. enchanted landscape of the vision; who loved her first, naturally, as her kinsman-afterwards, with that intel- lectual sympathy which can only exist between the mature teacher and the expanding pupil; who, in fine, took her to the highest place in his affection, and gave her his complete confidence when her sky of youth was unshadowed, and who cheered her with the one, nor ever took from her the other, when the pallid mists of shame settled sombrely down upon her obscured life. By birth endowed with the privileges and restraints of a membership in the Society of Friends-unfortunate birthright-Reginald Ware's childhood was perverted, and his natural joyous temper at length permanently embittered, by a thousand vexatious checks imposed upon the hilarity of his youth. Through a long line of unresisting ancestors, he had inherited a will as im- perious, a temper as sudden and violent as if his fathers had never grasped batons less noble than the trun- cheons of absolute command, and as if his mother had been the daughter of a king. The better qualities of courage and generosity, which assort almost always so kindly with the characteristics just mentioned, were also developed in full degree, all combining to render him a boy of high temper, with a good heart, and a disposition of infinite gaiety. A disposition too gay, by far, for the cheerless atmosphere which surrounded him. A temper too sunny, as he had constant assur-   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.        17 ance by the innumerable troubles in which it persist- ently involved him. Mounted on his high-spirited colt, and bantered to a race by his companion, Joe Barbeyrac, how otherwise could he do than shake a free rein against the arched neck of the eager animal?--which brought him con- dicn punishment. With a quick-taking ear, how could he help learning the gay songs which Joe Barbeyrac used to sing; -and how, while they were yet ringing in his brain, could he restrain their melodious utterance? -which was forbidden and, in mid-warble, roughly broken off. Having read "Ivanhoe"--a new number of the astonishing series of splendid romances, then issuing from the pen of that great unknown genius-- now unknown nevermore-how could he repress his enthusiasm for the pomp and circumstance of the tournament, the chivalric spirit of old feudal knight- hood?-which was harshly reproved as tending to foster a  warlike spirit. How could he decline Joe ]Barbeyrac's bounteous proffer of the use of their family library, supplied with goodly store of such ravishing pictures of an age, which, to all gentle hearts, and most of all, to generous boyhood, is the true "age of gold"-the era of ringing lists watched and enlight- ened by tearful or haughty eyes, of women whose beauty makes poor the painter's art to portray, and can only live in the heated imaginations of beauty-worship-     18   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. pers, and in the hinting words of poets;-the era of sounding battle-fields with knightly belt and spurs for the winning-the era of ruined castles, -whose ghastly corridors are traversed at the very "witching time of night" by muffled foot-falls, which now, while we read, echo in the next dark hall so fearfully that we shudder and do not dare to turn? Reginald Ware had not to endure sudden outhursts of tyranny, violent acts of oppression. Well had it been for his happiness if these had been his heaviest grievances. There may be a more galling yoke than a ponderous yoke of iron, and often it is harder to bear so light a weight as a mere wreath-of nettles, per- haps. Reginald's father might have fed him on coarser fare, clad him in scantier garments, driven him earlier a-field and worn him out with severer toil; he might have punished him with reckless tyranny for crimes never committed, or he might have beaten him with cruel blows for petty faults of neglect or accident. In neither of these regards could the boy justly complain. And here be it said, at the risk of winning to the side of the oppressor, the sympathies of those worthy and ultra-amiable people who make it a cardinal point in their articles of philanthropy, if not of religion, that all exercise of physical force in household discipline should be abated at once and forever as a tremendous system of oppression-be it admitted, I say, even at   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       19 the hazard of setting the theory of Solomon and the practice of the elder Ware at perplexing variance, that rod, nor thong, nor persuasive switch ever fell upon back of human boy, in the scrupulous household of the Wares. And here, too, I aver, perhaps without being sure of gaining the acquiescence of all my readers, that a closely followed system of correcting, checking, re- minding, and setting right, and a persistent course of refusal to acknowledge and make room for the out- spoken thoughts, sympathies, .gayeties, even the faults of a child, constitute the most vexing tyranny that a frank-hearted boy can be made to endure. It would not be more unwise to give a garden-tree, now and then, a stunning blow with a hatchet, so that it should split, and ever afterwards grow awry, wearing grievous scars upon its rind, than to dig the earth lip every day around its roots, every day to prune away each natural shoot, and graft the vigorous limbs until, by very cul- tivation, it should grow pale, and poorly, and cast its leaves in mid-summer. It was no passionate cruelty that alienated Reginald's filial affection. Perhaps cruelty of that stamp could not so have moved hin. But when, to consider an in- stance, he saw his father close a chafing discourse on the evil tendencies of the human heart, the wickedness of war, and the whole duty of parents to their off-     20   THE HEART OF. MABEL W ARE. spring, by deliberately burning a borrowed copy of a forbidden novel, which had been discovered in its hid- ing-place, sternly refusing to his son the means of mak- ing restitution to its owner; and when he reflected that this act was only a fitting exponent of the paternal discipline to which he was subject, how could he re- strain his indignation at the injustice, the heartlessness of a discipline so ruthlessly despotic-how quench the heat of his vehement passion, except in the smothering glooms of passive hate. But if Reginald Ware manifested palpably enough his utter inability, as well as disinclination, to curb his nature to the yoke which had rested so long and easily on the necks of all his tribe, not so did his only brother James. He was a cold and wily hypocrite. Born in another country, and at another time, James Ware might have risen from the lowest station in the Society of Jesus-into which order, doubtless, he would have been instinctively impelled-until he should have suc- ceeded to the admired sanctity and undisputed sway of Ignatius Loyola himself; or, doffing his uniform cap of the Valteline, he might, like the Italian Mazarin, have donned successive insignia of office, until he should have worn a cardinal's hat, and wielded the premier's sceptre of a nation as great as France, hoarding miserly gold in his coffers, and tampering with queenly fame for his profit. But, in the sphere that received him,   THE HEART- OF MABEL WARE.       21 this great genius turned his attention, without loss of time, to the task of winning the golden opinions of his brotherhood, and the golden possessions of all man- kind; and in this pursuit he soon made gratifying pro- gress. His craft seemed not so much a constituent element of his intellect as a general instinct permeating and actuating all his faculties, making itself apparent in every the slightest act. Whether he spoke the truth with intent to convey the true impression, or spoke a palpable, though deftly-cloaked lie, or, speaking the truth, so tortured its significance that in the end he had effected a deception, yet he did it all craftily, astutely. If, in the most natural mood, he performed the most natural act, it was still accomplished with infinite tact and cleverness. Oh, be sure here was a great genius. And so it happened that while Reginald Ware, losing the wildness of his boyhood in a-precocious manliness, which was the result of his habits, of dis- gust at his social environment, and withdrawal to the society of books and meditation, came to be regarded with dislike, and was finally given over by the breth- ren of his household of faith to the world and to the devil-synonymous destinies-his brother James, by many years his senior, had already won among them a reputation, most enviable in his own eyes, as a sober and discreet young Friend. Nay, more, by means of the frequent religious gatherings of these people, he 2*.-     22   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. had become known and esteemed through half a score of counties nearest his father's residence. At the same time, his success in the pursuit of more substantial gain was not less abundant, and certainly not less gratifying to his own aspirations. Already, without trenching on his estate in expectancy in his father's wealth, he had, by wily and assiduous bargain- ing, become the possessor of a farm, with a single ex- ception the largest in the borough, and the footings of his rental, unmarred by deducted expense accounts, were swelling month by month, and undergoing gra- dual metamorphoses from bank accounts to well-backed notes, and from notes to mortgages, and from mort- gages to-nothing more at present, though the despotic ghost of Sudden Foreclosure began to stalk through his wily dreams.   Blossoms a-manie come on a tree, But who canne tell the yield there will be I Fishes a-manie swim to ye nette, What fisherman knows the caste he may gette I Loves a-manie have sudden birth, Some in heaven, but more on earth; Earth-born loves growe quickly colle, Heaven-born loves weare never olde, Soe, however, love's birth be guessed, Who would knowe, must bide for ye teste.

MARY NEWLAND, sweet Mary Newland, whose brown eyes beamed so softly, and whose brown htair gleamed in sun or shade so goldenly, whose voice ever cheeringly rang, and whose- little feet ever dancingly peeped from under the skirt of her gown, demure and gray; Mary Newland, who was the only daughter of the man who possessed the only larger farm in the borough than that of James Ware-the two farms by chance adjoined each other; Mary Newland, who was, in fine, the admiration of the borough's meek chivalry, and must I say-it, the envy of the borough's beauty, had it whispered one night, to her astonished little ear, that without knowing it, and without art at all, she had won the admiration of Reginald Ware. She had long before recognized his superior bearing, habits of life; and range of thought, in comparison with other young men about her, and had often listened to his conversation with a mute curiosity that made her a     26   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. listener altogether charming and delightful. She had never sympathized with the prevalent distrust of his character; but the scope of that character, the strength of his unappreciated nature, the simple girl was poorly able to comprehend. She had in her gentle heart no depth of womanly tenderness and devotion to match the bounty of in- tellectual vigor, the treasures of affection, which he sought to lavish at her feet. Neither understood, nor could ever appreciate the other. His abrupt and ar- dent wooing, frightened instead of winning her. Now, she yielded, overcome by the violence of his affection, now, retreated in maiden timidity before the fierce tide of his passion. Never met lover in mistress such per- plexity of moods; never, since the amorous and needy Romans clasped, in mailed arms, the struggling Sabine daughters and dames, did mistress so tremble before her uncontrollable squire. By some untoward means information of his brother's suit was, one fine day, brought to the ears of James Ware. That evening he presented himself before Mary New1and, armed with her father's consent, as a rival suitor for her hand. Rejected, he was not baffled. The poor girl had little force of character. She was no match for the cunning James Ware, standing as he did on the vantage ground of her father's consent.   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       27 No match, at least, except in the sense of owning the larger farm, in expectancy-and adjoining his own too. James Ware chuckled with incredible ugliness, at the thought, and so, stopping at the drapers,he cheapened and purchased a wedding-coat, in the lustre of which garment, a month later, in the presence of all the family connexion, except an absent brother, and in the presence of a gray flock of witnesses, he took the Newland farm to be his lawful homestead property, as long as grass should grow or water run, and brown- eyed Mary Newland, with pale face and damp brow, to be his lawful wedded wife; promising in the somewhat exaggerated phrase of style, in the use of such intan- gible words as "love," "honor," and "protect," to re- cognize toward her the ordinary civilities of married life. A month or two thereafter, or possibly sooner, and mayhap a little later, old John Newland, having achieved in behalf of his daughter a settlement in life so auspicious and desirable, needs must exhibit the complaisance to relieve: his son-in-law of an annoying incumbrance; so, he was gathered to his fathers, and, enjoying the reward of his deeds in another place, was directly thought of here no more. A.     r - O   Sooner, later, from his home, Everie manne sets oute to roam; Some goe wept for, some goe jeered; Sorrie goe some, and some goe cheered; Some go easte and some goe weste; Longe shall most roam, ere they rest. Some are gentle and some are clowns, Those meet welcomes and these meet frownes; Some bee wearied ande come home, Others the wearier widelier roame; Alien landes their sore feet tread, Alien skies bend over their head.. Earth-born loves grown colde they say, Truer lover comes another day, Bolts in vain against love are locked, Prisons for love are rudeliest shocked.     k   "I. RECEIVING his share of the paternal wealth, cheap- ened by a moiety in ruinous compromise, Reginald, Ware turned his back on the home of his youth, with- out an emotion of regret. Bearing about him an air of entire freshness, his pi- quant originality charmed -an ennuied circle into which it was his 'fortune to be cast, and, to his' own astonish- ment, his debut in the saloons of fashion wore very nearly the dignity of an event. He was refined and courteous by nature. His unsophisticated ignorance, therefore, suggested no quality of clownishness. His conversation, by reason of disuse of social intercourse, had that purity, that chaste elegance which is some- times observed inl foreigners who have learned our lan- guage from books alone, and have never acquired the vulgarity of style which so surely pays the tax of col- loquial proficiency. He was conversant with literature, ancient and contemporaneous; 'and possessed in his     32   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. natural brilliant parts a guarantee of welcome from the intellectual companions to whom his acquirements gave him ready access. Very soon, therefore, the smart of wounded affection was banished away from his heart, and the thought of Mary Newland became only a pleasant memory. Now, being released so suddenly from a social re- straint which had up to this time embittered his whole existence, his character seemed to undergo a radical change. He became humorous, and genial, and gay. His bearing, honorable and manly, gained him worthy friends. Finely moulded in person, and full of vi- vacity, he was flattered by the admiration of women. He fell into a life of elegant dissipation. From being limited so harshly, by the bands of a pseudo morality, finding himself free, he rushed, with the sense of liberty, to the opposite extreme and tampered with vice, conscious of danger, but willing even at ruinous hazard, to gratify his curiosity. There was in his own innate refinement of tastes, no less than in the subtle and subdued modes of pleasure prevalent in the social circle in which he moved, a double barrier to withhold Reginald Ware from walk- ing for any length of time in the paths of coarser dissi- pation and vice. But, notwithstanding these, he found and trod an easy way to the tables of chance, where he learned to lose unflinchingly and to win without exul-   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.        33 tation--the two great lessons of game. Surrounded, too, by gay women, and possessing, in an eminent de- gree, the amorous dispositions of early manhood, he fell, with great naturalness, into habits of intrigue, and, -alas, for the truth-became a dread to the husbands of the intellectual beauties, whose pride was flattered by the homage of the distinguished new-comer, and whose regards were given to his easy winnings. He became, also, a successful author, and for a time filled a place in the literary world hardly less brilliant than that yielded to him in the world of fashion. Reginald Ware, however, is but a subordinate char- acter on the stage with which we have to deal at pre- sent, and we hasten to the end of this introductory sketch. Two or three years spent in the glare of gay life ac- customed him to its excitements and revealed to him its tawdriness. He turned to seek in other scenes the lost stimulation which had now become a necessity of life. He saw his native shores sink behind the billows, and tasted the enthusiasm of the young traveller's threshold cup, as he plants foot for the first on the shores of fatherland. He saw in their affluence and in their abjectness the homes of " merrie England." He threaded the storied hills and legend-living glens of Scotland. He noted, with curious eye, how the crum- bling and wrinkled body of the Old, wears ever and     34   THE HEART OF MABEL IWARE. everywhere upon its breast, in glittering decoration, the boast and pride of the New age. In Paris he quaffed with renewed zest, the more highly-flavored goblet of that dissipation which had palled his appetite in its hum- bler guise at home. He traversed the valleys of c" fair and pleasant France." Spain, Switzerland, the Rhine, the Elbe, and the Danube, opened for him their trea- sures of beauty and sublimity. The old pictures of the Past, so loved in his boyhood, emblazoned with shin- ing names--of nations whose march, striking into step from some heroic word, or blow, or deed, flashed its long blaze of splendid achievement in his wondering eyes, till he turned with relief to the mist of their latter- day declining;--of men, whose words, strong or sweet, whose deeds, brilliant or noble, whose lives, serene or violent, used to lure away his soul to more than imagi- nary companionship;-and of battles, whose sweeping clangors and fierce music sound for ever in the ear of the rapt student the roll-call of the heroic centuries, and summon up for his admiring the struggles and the for- tunes of the men who triumphed and who fell,-all these old pictures started up before his eyes into actual being--being, alas, in ruin-along the classic shores of the Levant. Chance had made him one of a party of English tra- vellers. With the enthusiasm of boyhood, revived by the scenes and associations around them, and forgetting   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.        85 the worldly wisdom which three years of fashionable life ought more thoroughly to have implanted, he again lost his heart. The proud father of the fair-haired English girl, whose beauty had won his admiration, refused with unwise and unnecessary violence, to lend his sanction to their union. Accordingly, one fair and favoring night, like that when Jessica "Did steal from the wealthy Jew, And with an unthrift love did run from Venice As far as Belmont," did Reginald Ware, "stealing her soul with many vows of faith," bear from the old Venetian palace, where her 'father's household were sojourners, the pride of that household, the sweet girl whose home, on the castled Severn was thenceforth for ever relentlessly barred to her and hers. Reginald Ware and Mary Burleigh found shelter from the pursuit of the indignant father on the shores of one of the little lakes in the north of Italy. Here they chose their home. Love was with them to render it happy. Classic seclusion and refined leis- ure lent it elegance. Five years came and went. Then came Death too, and went, but not alone. Reginald digged the double grave that robbed him of Mary and their child, and wandered away to the westward. With his hopes blighted, with his heart faint at the     36   THE HEART   OF MABEL WARE. sudden and fierce bereavement, he fled as from a sha- dow back to his native land, nor rested until his weary eyes were soothed, as they fell here and there on the remembered scenes of his boyhood's home, and filled with sad but consoling tears as he recurred to the wasted heart-treasures of his youth.   Narrowe years do ye roamers know, Narrowe, yet crowded wi change, I trow; But the times growe thinne as well, And emptier far, for those who dwell. Childe-birth travails, and heart-need lacks, Dwellers at home may soreliest tax; And dwellers and roamers alowe must sleep, But friends canne be colde and aliens can weep. Dwellers too heedfully nourish cares; But in the far parts how free one fares! And nourished cares are guests as I thinke Drugging ye pledge-cup a hoste may drink; And, when in an ambush, madness waites, ll wager him hid withinne a man's gates 3     I             I   MhIV al r    MARY NEWLAND had always been a happy girl, Mary Ware, from some untoward and inexplicable cause, was never a happy woman. Words did not corroborate the silent utterances of wasting health and sad-looking eyes but when she had raised her head from the pillow with painful effort to look upon her new-born babe; when she had pressed her lips to its forehead with feeble tenderness, and when with bap- tismal chrism of motherly tears she had named it Mabel, she drooped down upon her pillow and meekly died. And James Ware was called upon to bury his loving wife. Fortunately the great Newland farm neither took to itself wings, nor in' any other manner depre- ciated in marketable value. Therefore, with many devout and crafty reflections, its owner solaced himself and presently was comforted. And having established a notable housewife, Martha Ruggles hight, of severe     40   THE IIEART OF MABEL WARE. aspect, of desponding mood, and of triumphant vir- ginity, at the head of his domestic establishment, charging her with the stewardship of his dairy, his daughter, and his pantry, sundry chests of flannels and linens, divers pieces of plate, kitchen-maids, and poul- try-he departed to attend a yearly meeting, where he was observed to demean himself with his old well- ordered sobriety, and whence being returned, he was again observed to apply his industry to the manage: ment of his affairs with unabated cleverness. Nor was this comfortable estate of mind perturbed inordinately when the next winter his gray-haired father was taken with a fit of coughing of such un- usual violence-he had been subject to fits of this kind in the winter-that he coughed his breath quite out of his worn-out old lungs, and not being able to regain it, nor yet able wholly to do without it, had struggled very hard, then very faintly, then gasped a moment desperately, and-nothing more except to drop the jaw, to grow cold of body and sharp of feature, and to lie there with staring eyes, dead. James quietly made arrangements for renting the paternal acres--the title-deeds had already been de. posited in his iron chest for several months-made out the leases in his own name, and-went on. These events, namely, the marriage of James Ware, the birth of his daughter, the death of his wife, the in-   !t'G       THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       4 stallation of Martha Ruggles, and the fatal coughing-fit of the old Quaker, all occurred within the first two years after Reginald's departure. Few other changes were observable either in the family, or in the neigh- borhood. The Barbeyracs had long before, on the de- cease of Joe's father, left their country-home, and gone to a northern city, where Joe had entered a profession, married, buried his wife, and died, about the time of Reginald's exodus from the paternal walls, leaving a son to the care of his bereaved mother, and to the in- heritance of his very considerable fortune. This little boy, Eugene Barbeyrac, used to come each year with his grandmother-a stately but tender- hearted woman-to spend the summer months in the pleasant old family mansion; and the two children, Eugene and Mabel, were thus every summer thrown together, becoming constant playmates-the mutual shyness which each discovered as each year they met, wearing quite away with the first hour, and leaving perfect childish confidence and affection for another twelvemonth. The meadows, the pastures, the woods, and the river-banks were wandered by these two chil- dren hand-in-hand. And, with no other event in her life than these sojournings of her playmate, who came almost with the birds and flowers of Spring, but who went, alas, when the flowers withered and the bird- songs ceased, Mabel Ware changed from  a  house-     42   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. wife-nursed and puling baby, to a thoughtful, seven- year child. About this time James Ware began to conceive plans of almost fabulous cunning. His acuteness- penetrating enough before, one would think-grew so sharp and pointed that it became a question whether he would long have any left. He wondered at his former prodigality, at the little attention he had given to his suffering pecuniary affairs, and he invented such miraculous schemes of doubling and redoubling his in- come, such systems of keeping all snug, and making both ends of the year meet-such resolutions of econo- my and prudence, as to his debtors, that he finally be- came involved in an inextricable mesh of schemes, plots and calculations, and lost clear away from himself, so that he could do little other than mutter and wink at Martha Ruggles, until at last it was flatly evident that the poor man was not "all right here," as Martha said pointing with her thumb to her left eye-brow. James Ware was sent to a mad-house where, with characteristic wile, he contrived to convey to his cell sundry little pebbles, delectifying himself with the con- ceit, that in every pebble so secured, he had defrauded his keeper out of a very considerable landed property. And so in earnest did he grow in his species of finan- cial dexterity, that he stored his cell with incredible fortunes, leaving himself barely space to eat and sleep.   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       48 The conduct of the madman's estate, had been placed in the hands of trustees, who resigned their trust in favor of the brother, when, pitying the unprotected state of his little niece, he accepted, on his return, her guardianship. Reginald Ware, therefore, after eight years of absence, found himself once more in his native valley, the controller of his brother's fortune, and the guardian of Mary Newland's daughter.        Oh, deare to the comers from foreign lande Is the welcome blithe,. and the close shake-hande; Oh, sweet to the roamers joined who did roam, Parted, to join again at home. And they gossip faste, and they gossip long, And they drink olde pledges wi' storie and song; Oh defthe can each one mend a link, In another's chaine of memorie broken; And pleasantly each makes ye other think O' fair sights seen, and o' bright words spoken. Until the wanderers-gossipping here-- Goe roaming agen, wi' pilgrim cheer. Soe the roamers but dwellers at home, Look on the faces that toe them come, Lose the faces that fromme them goe, List for tidings that come too slowe, And hearing, hear weal or haply woe. 3*     ip *   HEN abel was in hera sixteenth ear, her father WHEN Mabel was in her sixteenth year, her father suddenly resumed the temperate exercise of his wits, spurned forth his pebbly treasures, and was re-instated as the controller of his person and affairs. Irritated at finding his fortune unaugmented except by its natural moderate increase, he found in the voluminous records of his brother's stewardship, food for infinite vexation, As might have been infallibly predicted, the brothers quarreled. Reginald went-forth again from his native valley, not now as before, without an emotion of regret; -but grieving bitterly over the separation from his pupil and companion. The return of her father, and the departure of her uncle were events which commenced a new era in the life of Mabel Ware. Hitherto, from her infancy she had lived under the constant watchfulness of her pre- ceptor, and had learned to depend too completely upon his guidance and wisdom. No unnecessary check had     48   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. ever disturbed the natural and easy flow of her life. The neighborhood in which she lived was thoroughly quiet. Her companions had been few, and with these she had never been very intimate. Once or twice each year, some strange gentleman, or perhaps a party of gentlemen, who lived it may be in Europe, or if in this country, yet in some place which to Mabel seemed quite as far away, would come to greet Reginald, to pass a few days with him, renewing their old friendship and calling up in so quiet a retreat their mutual souvenirs of pleasure and adventure in other days, and in places so distant that Mabel, listening, could hardly believe them in this same world. To her these occa- sional visits, were epochs of tremendous interest. The sojourn of these comers at the Wold, was like the passing-by of a pageant, full of circumstance and splendor in the eyes of the simple girl. The men seemed like the heroes of romance and song. If one of them, with bearded face, free glance, high bearing and unique attire stood for a moment beside some " weighty member of the meeting," with sober gait, meek deport- ment, flat-cornbed hair, closely cropped beard, and quaint garments of clannish color and fashion, he seemed like a demigod in the unequal comparison. Many of these strangers had met Reginald abroad; and having recently returned, hastened to pay their early duty to their friend who had preceded them.   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       49 One of these had been wandering up the Nile, and he told of pyramids and palms, of Bedouin Sheiks and Arabian horses, of sand-deserts and ruined cities, and a hundred legends of the God-River. Another had been diving into the depths of Scandinavian lore, and ex- ploring like a lava-digger the beautiful mysteries of the Norse literature-almost hidden by the overwhelming tide of Time; and he told of winters in Norway and Sweden and Siberia; of the hardy but tender-hearted and romantic inhabitants of the North of Europe, and  of the gayety of the Northern capitals. One had been collecting the ballads and legends of Castile and Arra- gon, and he had tales to tell, of amorous Spanish maids with lustrous eyes and dainty feet; tales of des- perate loves, and revenges too ghastly to seem real; stories of perfidy and cruelty, with the sounding names of great noblemen, and high-born ladies, strangely and guiltily intercoupled. Almost all these guests had been in Central Europe, and with the natural love for republicanism, which most Americans carry abroad with them, had been at- tracted by mutual sympathy into friendships with the great revolutionary leaders. These spoke always with deep. personal interest of the condition of European state affairs, evincing an intimate knowledge of the motives as well as of the public acts of the' various great cabinets, and uttering the sounding names of     50   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. politicians, of captains and of kings, with the unfeigned familiarity of men who had talked with them face to face. Mabel looked upon the guests, and listened to them with awe. She was gratified when they commended her proficiency in study, and when they amused her with stories which they deemed better adapted to interest the child; but their conversations, as- they sat after dinner at wine, only fragments -of which she could, by some artifice of an open window, or a friendly curtain, overhear, -- conversations sparkling with wit, replete with anecdotes of distinguished men, and allusions to other lands,-and, more than all, tinged and enriched with a certain quality of self-reli- ant speculation-a questioning, a sentry-call to stand and give countersign, with which these men seemed to salute whatever offered to pass, whether religious creeds, established systems of political affairs, usages of social life, codes of taste, or whatever other artificial creation, in literature, polity, or religion,---these con- versations were to her the principal charm of their visits from the outer world. Once, such a party of friends of Reginald brought with them a youth-a stranger who had travelled with them from a foreign land, who had gained their inti- macy, and who accompanied them, as they made this little pilgrimage to a shrine of friendship, as a curious   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       51 stranger, regarding the character of the country. This guest was not like the large, bearded men who accom- panied him,. and those who generally came; but on the contrary, he seemed in their company hardly more than a boy. There was that, however, in his haughty and firm lips, and in his unembarrassed demeanor, which quickly reminded the person who dealt with him, that he was dealing with a man. There was, moreover, a wonderful power in his eyes, which seemed quietly to penetrate all barriers of secrecy, and all wards of reserve, and go straight on in their mission of discovering, in spite of all arts, until they had seen the motives and the fears, and the close thoughts of others. There was about him, too, a quality which I am at a loss to describe by any better phrase than an apparent experience which seemed like intuition of men, of mo- tives, of books, of customs and of nature, of sufferings and of joy, of pleasure-perhaps of crime-and of pain. It is not intended, by this expression, to convey the idea that Philip Sutherland was, or appeared to be, blaze. On the contrary he was fresh, piquant, vigorous and joyous;, but if having known him, you had after wards heard a tale of love and hate, of suffering, or of courage and, perhaps, of perfidy, and that Sutherland had been a chief actor, the exponent of one, or either, or all of these, you would not have wondered, nor been in any manner doubtful, that it was he, but would pre-     52   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. sently have remembered in him such qualities as the issues of the story had developed, and you would soon recognize him well in every impulse and act.--Such were his intuitive capabilities. Mabel saw little of this young stranger until the very day of his departure. That morning, as she was water- ing her flowers, it happened that he, too, came alone into the garden, to breathe the morning air. .Noticing the child, he approached her, and after inquiring if she was the daughter of his host, proffered his aid in train- ing a clematis, which had strayed from its proper place against the wall of the summer-house. This accom- plished, he sat him down on the shaded seat, and taking Mabel's hand, and peering curiously into her eyes, began to ask a hundred questions about her studies, her readings, her companions, and finally led her, with appreciative hinting suggestions, to speak of her young dreams of life, of aspirations, and wonderings. That afternoon he left Wahlen-Wold with his party, and they saw him no more. A few months afterwards they learned that a ship, on which he was a passenger, had foundered, carrying all on board down with her, and Mabel, who remembered their meeting in the garden, and their long conversation, which seemed to her so strange to remember, wept and shuddered as she thought of him now, with his long hair full of sand, And his hand, which held her's that pleasant norning,   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       53 now, alas, " tossing with tangle and with shells," deep down below the gulfs. The climbing plant, which he had helped to train, was henceforth called Philip's Clematis. For the rest, the sunny-tempered Eugene Barbeyrac seemed to her like a brother, and his stately grandam unbent always from her stateliness in the presence of these two. If she loved either better than the other, indeed, it would have been difficult for her to elect the favored one. So went the days by at Wahlen-Wold. A      "   Going to sleep, night-words must be saide, And a manne should speak before he is dead, Some forgiving, some cheering word, By wife, or childe, or friend to be heard.

And some mayhap have a tale at heart, Which for calm dying they must impart; A tale soe grim it never will rest, Albeit yhidde in a dead man's breast.     1%   VI. &iGe femmssonL "AST year, when the too brief Indian summer was drawing to its dreamy close, when the east wind began to wail round the gables, when the cold rain-clouds be- gan to thicken in the sky, and the year went pallid and shivering to its quick-coming death--the message reached me that Reginald Ware desired my attendance at his bedside, while he should go down into the valley of shadows. My watch was not a long one. Three days after my arrival he died. In the interval, our conversations were broken and painful. He committed to my charge a large manuscript-book and a portfolio of papers, let- ters, and memoranda of dates, places, names. I had already known the outline of Mabel's story. "It is all here; " said Reginald, as he pointed to the book and portfolio. "Her story is told there. The manuscript-book, written by her own hand, is at first, radiant with the loveliness and purity of girlhood.

ABOUT a six hours' journey away from the quaint town, whose people love, halfjestingly, but yet with no small mixture of complacent pride, to style their clean and rectangular streets, their long rows of red brick wall, faced with white marble, and defaced with white wooden window shutters; their splendid, and- for a country so new as this--ancient public buildings, and their noble fountained parks, "The City of Broth- erly Love,"-about a six hours' journey away from that quaint town, the traveller, if he happen to pursue the necessary direction, shall observe-with many a curi- ous glance it is hoped-a single lofty mountain, which rises with a considerable show of sublimity, a few miles to the north of the mainly-travelled thoroughfare. I      "   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. And when his eye shall have scanned once and again the outline and the proportions of this bold peak, it will wander away to the westward, along the uneven horizon at the top of a range of mountainous hills, pausing again and again in its survey, now to look twice at some far-away mountain-road, winding its zigzag course up the steep heights, and losing itself at last in the mysteries of sotne heavy wood; now wondering at the industry and patience of the farmers, who have ex- tended the area of their clearings to the very summit of the higclest peaks; and now marking, if his eye siall have any skill in woodcraft, the various character of the forest trees, by the deeper or lighter green in their folilage. But the mountain wlhich first attracted his attention will recall his gaze from its amused wan- derings, and claim his curious watchfulness as often as every mile of his journey gives its outline a new phase, and, to some degree, another character. At the foot of the eastern slope, if a descent so nearly perpendicular may be called a slope, of this mountain, which is as it were the tower at the extremity of the long rampart of lesser hills, flows a quiet and lazy river. Tills strc:lam is not navigable at the point where we reach it, except for sloops and schooners of propor- tions absurdly diminutive, and for small river steam- boats, built with lighltest draucght, anrd so fitshoned as to be able to creep over shoal saui bars which would   THE  HEART OF MABEL    WARE.    65 indubitably strand a bathing-tub of ordinary dimen- sions. In the winter, however, the floods swell the ca- pacity of the current; and then long rafts, formed from the trunks of great trees, deftly lashed together, come sweeping along from the upper countries, giving the peaceful inhabitants short glimpses, as they pass, of roughly accoutred and black-bearded men, shouting strange oaths, ribald jests, and reckless laughter, and then hurrying on with the muddy current to be seen no more. This little river, while it runs close to the mountain, seems to felicitate itself in respect of its vicinity to so bold a feature of the landscape, and evinces its affection for its rough neighbor, by clasping with a quick curve each projecting buttress of rock, and by casting itself hurriedly into the embrace of each little hollow nook in the bank--where frosts, or earth-slides, or chafing torrents, have left their grottoes-affording only space for a narrow and dubious path between its margin and the steep declivity. Leaving, with some show of reluc- tance, the last ledge of rocks, the sinuous channel now grows straight between its banks and moves on to the south with energy, as if disgusted with its mission of flowing and determined presently to put an end to the- business forevermore. The country hereabout and  below this is tolerably level, presenting a succession of rich and well-tilled ' ^.'   -!     "  THE HEART OP MABEL WARE. farms. Three or four miles below the point where the river leaves the mountain, it crosses a broad and dusty old turnpike; and here, for the behoof of travellers thereon, it is itself crossed each day more or less fre- quently, as the exigencies of these dusty pilgrims may require, by an ancient wheel ferry-boat; the conve- nience being propelled by the benevolent exertions of eight spavined legs, stimulated to their duty by touches piquant and encouraging, from the black whip which arms and embellishes the hand of Cyrus Todd the younger; and alternating with other eight spavined legs, as often as once in six hours. This prominence and responsibility, it should be here explained, is as- signed to the aforesaid sixteen morbid members the more readily, as it has never been observed that the wall-eyed and mouldy heads which appear at the stall windows, exercise the slightest volition in the matter, for while the heads sleep and nod, the legs move on in the same monotonous step. Nor should it be omitted in passing to say, that Cyrus Todd the younger, is the son of the man-himself a Cyrus Todd too-who re- ceived by way of patrimony, from Cyrus Todd the elder, the wheel-boat, the eight horses with their sixteen legs, and the right of ferriage, with all prescriptive rights and exclusions, privileges, appurtenances, and heredi- taments thereto belonging and appertaining. The proprietor of this ferry drives a business less   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.,        67 thriving now than of yore, as may be inferred from the spectacle of a second boat, like the first, but more an- cient, which now rests stranded on the sandy bank, with one end sunk ruinously in the muddy water, and the other gradually falling to pieces in the sun and storm. The old ferryman and his son are humorists of almost incredible facetiousness; and like many others of their tribe, love most to display their powers in a bitter and gloomy sarcasm against the world around them. Many of their most scathing witticisms, it must be confessed, have lost in some degree their first piquancy, by reason of a habit into which this brace of wits have fallen, of "t getting off" the sharp sayings a little too frequently; but in 'this regard it is a plea- sant reflection that their calling brings them constantly into the presence of a changing auditory. Indeed it happens not unfrequently that some traveller crosses the ferry who has never had the happiness before. The wit of the family, on such occasions, is contrived to be "gotten off" with such effect, and with such aid of sly winks, nudges, and pokes in the ribs, that it often goes near to reduce the too happy stranger to convulsions of merriment. The grand target at which these merry ferrymen let fly their barbed shafts, is the reckless stupidity of the age, as illustrated by the una- nimity with which an infatuated travelling public com- mits its safety to a Board of cold-blooded capitalists,     68   THE IIEART OF' MABEL WARE. (who pocket their money and set them flying over the country, at desperate speed, through a million grim deaths; and, in fine, whisk them across this very con- siderable river, with shuddering haste, in little shriek- ing steamboats, which can be seen only two miles be- low the old safe ferry, flying across the water black- decked with the flock of birds of passage, who come and go like other passage-birds-only these last need not fear collisions. A little village founded in some forgotten era, con- taining half a dozen stone houses, an inn and post-office, two blacksmith shops-rivals-a shoemaker's shop, a country barter store, a plain little Quaker meeting- house, and a score or two of small, wooden tenements whitened with lime-wash, has picked itself together at the end of the ferry, and now stands on the western bank of the river, apparently regarding itself with pro- found and sorrowful amazement at its own stupidity in having failed to select a site a mile or two lower down -where the railroad crossing was to have been located. Following the turnpike, a pretty thick wood, which borders the old village to the north, will give you a pleasant shade for a mile or thereaway, and if it be summer time you will be loth to leave it, and will, perhaps, turn to the right into the still shady and less dusty road, which runs away from the hot turnpike up toward the purple mountains.   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.        69 But, gentle traveller, if you are simply enamored of the pleasant shade, turn not up this quiet road. I warn you that the wood is but narrow. You will pass it in half an hour, if you let your horse walk never so slowly; and beyond it the sun is fierce too. Doubtless if you choose to travel on, the old turnpike will give you nobler scenery, more amusing incident, and alto- gether, more agreeable and profitable entertainment. My way, however, lies still through the shadows. These past, there is, a little further on, the gate of a lane, on the right hand, at the other end of which is a large mansion, whose balconies proffer shelter, and if you will follow me, there will I take you, promising such entertainment as the place affords. 4*      1%   Each dismounting, entered straight Welcomed each the castle's gate, Then they had them to a hall, Where did zephyrs stirre and wave, Sat them down and rested alle, Some knights doffing helm and glaive. -Then the knight who rode alone, Unsaluted and still unknown, Raised his visor half way up, Quaffed ye proffered threshold-cup, Craved of each his faire assent, And with bright eyes on him bent: "Here there lived a maid," he said, "Scorn not gentles, ye simple tale; Simply she lived, and early she wed, Where bliss should follow, there followed bale, Then a lover sought her bed- It needs not, lady, to drop thy veil; Maide, wife, husband, and lover, are dead, And some may scorn her, but some will wail."       IIL ; i  0me teab. THE mansion which we have found at the end of the lane, is a large square edifice, built of roughly-hewn stones, and flanked on either side by a long piazza with wooden pillars and a strong balustrade. A hall, broad and high, running through the centre of the house, opens by large double doors, with upper and lower divisions, out upon each piazza. The roof is steep, and on the sides, to the east and to the west, three dormer windows admit light to the attic cham- bers. At the north end of the main building, there is a long and low addition, the rooms of which are used by the occupants of the house, as kitchens, work-rooms, and convenient places of storage. High up under the cornices, a curiously-wrought oval window adorns each gable. The other windows through the house have very small panes of thick glass,-but those on the first floor are long, and open in divisions like those of the hall-doors, out upon the piazzas. From each end :of     74   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. these a flight of steps leads you town into paths that wander hither and thither through the garden, which encloses three sides of the house, and the yard which spreads out in front, and is entered on the opposite side by the lane, up which we came. The garden and the yard as well, have a score or more of tall trees scattered over the area without order, and numerous tufts of shrubbery and small garden trees, help to lend a rural and sequestered air to the spot. The house itself stands on the summit of a long ridge, which runs northwardly from the thick wood until it loses itself in the mountain, two or three miles above. To the eastward from the mountain-road, the land rises pretty boldly to the summit of this ridge, and then falls away in a gentle slope of a mile or so in breadth to the river. This slope broken to the south by the wood, and flanked eastwardly by the river, stretches away to the north, until, at a league's dis- tance, it too swells up into the first low hills at the foot of the mountain. The steep side of the ridge falling toward the road, is covered all along with orqhards and cornfields; and on this side too, between the mansion and the road, but a little to the northward, there are long barns grouped in such a manner as to enclose and shelter an area used as a barn-yard and sheep-fold. Each barn   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       75 has steep roofs and large, swinging doors, and two or three of the largest are adorned by fantastically carved weather-cocks, one .of which was originally intended for a veritable vane, and accordingly built with a pivot, so that it might have faced the winds' music to this day, if the invading rust had not long ago fatally ad. justed the index forevermore. Down along the road-side are a number of tenant- houses, each with its kitchen-garden about it, and its walls quaintly whitened with lime-wash. The eastward slope is broken into long fields of grain and meadows. In these, the planters come in the spring and walk painfully up and down the long distances, stopping at every step to drop and cover the corn seed; while in other fields come single men, and march sturdily back and forth above the brown fur- rows, ever swinging out their long arms over the earth as if bidding it be fruitful with a gesture of benediction. Here, too, in the summer mornings come the ranks of mowers, and striking in their bright scythes one after one, keep measured stroke and step and distance, while they charge sternly down through the pride of the meadows, the tall and waving grasses-all day nodding before their path, and alas, all day marking that path behind them with long ranks of the fallen. And fol- lowing the mowers come shouting boys, who toss hither and thither the serried swathes, and sometimes     76   THE HEART OF MABEL tWARE. come, also, the merry maids of the household, and the brown-cheeked daughters of the tenants, to lend their willing aid in saving the sweet-smelling treasure from the drowning rain that threatens. There, too, in the autumn, the ploughmen drive their patient teams a-field, and all day long move lazily up and down the slope, leaving the ground behind them deep-ridged and black. Here and there over the area, generally at the cor- ners of the fences, and along the river banks, young walnut-trees, tough and supple and straight, lend a pleasant shade for the mowers to find shelter under when they pause to rest. Here and there, too, a grace- ful elm, standing in mid-meadow, trails down its sway- ing boughs to the very grass-top,-but almost all the trees are walnut, and the children of the tenants, who come in the autumn to gather the sweet nuts, wonder why the elm-trees were ever made at all. And now again, gentle reader, I proffer you release. If it so please you, resume your journey on the dusty highway, where you will see more imposing scenes, and hear happier tales. But if the proud peak and the long hills, the mountain-road and the orchards and cornfields, the wood, the slope, the river with its lazy craft, and the quaint old mansion have about them any charm to lure you of a summer-day's leisure, why, we will sojourn here; and I, plucking the yet unwithered   THE HEART OF MABEL.

Occupied with her studies, her exercises, her read- ings, her conversations, her birds and her flowers, with the occasional agitations that will stir the pool of the dullest country life, with the annual sojourn of the Barbeyracs in the neighborhood, and with the visits of Reginald's friends, Mabel's girlhood wore on quickly and pleasantly. Her father's restoration, and the consequent depart- ure of her uncle, left her, for the first time. since she had been old enough to appreciate solitude, alone. - Per- haps the care with which she had been reared had been too sedulous. Perhaps the solicitude, which had ever been around her to watch and guard, had been too ten- der.-Certainly, she had not learned to be brave and serene under so severe a test as loneliness.

Hope may be bright, courage may be high, and good heart of grace may--nay, oftener than otherwise, does -sustain him nobly. His eye flashes and kindles. His breast heaves high with the enthusiasm of hope; yet this is like the ardor of the good warrior, which burns most brightly when the drearest dangers draw nigh. When night comes and leaves him alone, unstimulated    : by the watch of friends or foes, then he shudders. For him, however, the feeling is but transitory. His emo-   : tion shames him. He strikes a great ringing blow       against his breast; he stamps the ground in disdain at lIis weakness; he smiles out cheerily upon all terrors, and presently grows brave and strong again.   : But Mabel was only a girl; a timid, helpless, and    , too delicately nurtured child. It was not for her to be  ? ashamed of fear, nor to grow brave by laughing at the terrors around her, or by any petty artifice of stimulat- ing arts. She brooded over her forlorn loneliness in silence, and with tears.

My guardian has gone, and, for almost the first time in my life I realize a sense of complete loneliness. I watched him as he went, while I could yet distinguish his form, then the carriage as it wound along the winding road, and finally the lingering cloud of dust, which re- mained after the carriage had gone behind the wood; and now, I am alone. When may I see him again? How kind he has been to me I How much I owe him I How much I ought, and indeed how much I do love him! Last night when we were alone together the last time, he brought this book, in which I now write, and having inscribed simply my name very carefully in the first leaf, said, in a low tone, and in a manner which rendered it impossible that I should forget his words, L"Mabel, my child, it is nearly eight years since I returned from Italy, and assumed toward thee the responsibility of a guardian. I am now discharged from that responsibility by the restoration of thy father. In leaving thee, child, I have the consciousness that I have been guided always by a concern for thy welfare.

We will therefore leave it, as indeed we must, to time. I may say however, and I say it with un- shadowed confidence, that I have studied for years the singularly manifest dispositions of thy nature, and have found to my unspeakable satisfaction that a love for the truth, and a tendency to the right, are deeply-set- tled and controlling principles in thy heart. In this belief my child, I am induced to propose to thee the undertaking of a task, which I trust will not be irk- some in its execution, and which will, I cannot doubt exert upon thee a very wholesome and profitable in- fluence.

"And often, when sad moods of loneliness come upon thee, as I know such will come, when thy mind is unperturbed by the excitements of lifei and when thy heart is filled with strong yearnings for all that is high and pure, then read the book thou hast written. And as the skilful oarsman sitting with his face from his skiffs bow, yet determines his course by watching the line of his wlake, so wilt thou, by surveying the trodden path of thy feet, quickly discern the deviations when untoward influences may divert thee from thy true course. I leave thee, child, to choose thy own path, in a labyrinth so intricate that few are able to thread it wisely, so difficult that none have ever tra- versed it without erring. I would gladly remain and lend thee the aid of rlly experience; but not being per- mitted, I am solaced by the conviction that thy honest and pure impulses are less liable to wander than the sagest experience; and so, placing in thy hands this plan as a clue, and trusting that thy grasp will not un- loose from it, I go.

I will "give i  it my entire confidence;" and write here, as he re' quested, my " most secret meditations;" though indeed, I do not remember everto have had meditations that I thought should be secret. Yet I may have. I hope that my fancy will not always be the idle and wander- ing truant that it has always been. I may have secret meditations. Indeed, I hope I shall. To-day I am too sad to write; but, hereafter, I will frequently commune with my dear confidant, the un. written book. I feel already an affection for it. It is mine more than any other thing I possess. I love it. I will withhold nothing from it. I will leave all over its pure pages, the imprint of what I am.

Then each gueste that harboured there, Unhelmed knights and ladies faire, Looked upon the painted maid, From jewelled hand to hand conveyed.

And as each the picture tooke, Some glanced back a sudden look, Doubting glance of hinte obscure, But ye knight swore, "Oh, be sure, This young maiden was maiden-pure."       AT the age of sixteen, Mabel's mind was losing the artlessness and the constant agreeable astonishment of the young girl, in the sweet consciousness of the youth- ful woman. At the same time her form- became more roundly developed, and her limbs assuming a state- lier grace, grew easy and unembarrassed  in their office. Her brown hair fell demurely over a more : thoughtful brow. Her voice was less loud, but more musical. Her laugh became less free, but her smile was happier. Her step was less springing, and far less wanton but whatever man saw her pass; could butlook after and watch her going, paying involuntary homage to the grace of the retreating apparition. In fine, Ma- bel was not now a child, but henceforth a woman. Her health was perfect. Her natural sound consti- tution had been firmly established by habits of kindly exercise and judicious exposure to sun and wind. It was before said that her hair was brown. Her face was a    92   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. Grecian.

Her teeth were syrmrmetrical and smath and pure. Her upper lip, the most expressive and most dubious feature read of physiognomist, was finely chisellud, with a thousand haughllty contractions lurk- ing in its ordinary quiet curve. Her mouth was per- fect in bend, full-lipped, and rosy.

Over Mabel's face went variable shades of complex- ;  ion, changing quick like the shades of an April day,   now pale in thoughtful quiet, and now flushing bright- ly hued and rosily in response to any calling theme of the moment. Her form was full and round without lack- ing any feminine grace; her stature stately, and all her proportions symmetrical. In glancing back upon this picture, I am concerned lest some readers should obtain an erroneous impres- sion of the young creature whose portrayal is so feebly executed. It was said she was voluptuous in impulse, in capacity, and in beauty, and in these alone. Oh, I 5..

How might it be otherwise? Her reading, indeed, had been various and unrestricted; but if she had been permitted to pluck such rich-hued flowers as overhang the paths of romance, she had no less reached after the wholesome fruit whereunder walk sages, and philosophers, and his- torians. Moreover, who ever had come to Wahlen- Wold to awaken in her breast the fire of love? No; she felt in her heart the first low whisperings of rap- turous desire, but these came with her age, and respon- sive to the capabilities of her nature. They came un- bidden, as naturally as her form grew full and womanly --as spontaneously as her limbs grew round and accus- tomed, her mien stately and restrained. Whatever spirit might sleep within, certainly it remained yet unevoked. The hungry whirlwind of passion had never been roused.  I aver, that she was pure as your young sister, sir; chaste, madam, as your timid daugh- ter. Honi soit qui mal y sense.

In assuming the task of journalizing in her book, 1i a she seems to have been impressed with the propriety of prefacing the undertaking with such a retrospect of her experiences, as should serve in some degree as an index of her character, and should lend a completeness to the record which would otherwise seem abrupt and crude. She has, therefore, in the first entry, after the impulsive reverie which we have already transcribed, recorded such a review, as is in every way adapted to the present necessity, and which serves to delineate, more clearly than any possible description, the vigorous character of her intellect, and the pure and simple range of her esti- mates. We transcribe this also.     98   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. WAILEN WOLD, 10th mo., 10tl, 184-. The first autumnal rain is pitilessly beating off the russet leaves of the door-yard maples, and the murmur of the falling drops reaches me, sitting in my quiet room and looking down to the parti-colored wood across the fields. The sound makes the loneliness most grateful, and fills me with a disposition of thoughtful- ness. It is a fit day for lonely writing, and I have chosen it, after having waited a fortnight since my dear guardian left me, to make my acquaintance with   i my mute companion-the blank book. It has occurred to me, that in commencing, I should  preface what may be written, with some brief allusion to what has gone before, and though the task seems a  1 formal and unpleasant one, yet I fear I shall regret if I omit it. I scarcely remember anything of my early childhood. I was silent, neither happy nor unhappy, and, so far as I can remember, stupid-that is, without wonder, with- out care, and without expectation. I call to mind the children with whose faces I was familiar, but, except in those cases where I have since known them, the souvenirs are without interest. I seldom recur to that period, and in doing so, the only emotion that I expe- rience is a sort of careless wonder, mingled sometimes with something like incredulity. When I was seven years old my father was taken   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.        99 away, and I was told, without being made to under-. stand it, that he was mad. I did not comprehend the extent of the calamity that had fallen upon him, nor did I realize my own loss in being deprived of his pro- tection. But, without any distinct comprehension, I was aware of the oppressive presence of a great sorrow,  My heart was conscious of grief without being con- scious wherefore, and I could not find relief. My sleep was disturbed and filled with perplexing dreams. Un- heeded, I wandered the live-long day across and across  i the Wold, down the meadows to the river-banks, and away to the shady wood; but in wood, in meadows, nor on river-bank could I see to gather flowers, my eyes were so dim; and when I looked to the house, to  the river sloops, or to Reginald's Peak-it was not called Reginald's Peak then, it had no name-I could not see across the Wold for the blinding tears. Then my uncle came; and immediately, though not suddenly, a change came over me. I left my lonely walks to walk or ride with him, and my unhappy  thoughts were lost in the richness and novelty of his conversation. I was unconscious of it then, (I am glad that I was,) but now I remember and perceive that his  themes and manner were skilfully adapted to my un- cultivated state, and contrived for my pleasure and im- provement. I was also unconscious, but can perceive it now, (wondering the while at my guardian's judicious F     100  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. skill,) how day-by-day he elevated and expanded the character and scope of my thoughts. Very soon after he came, he began to give me the outlines of simple but affecting stories, and then, having awakened my interest, would bring the books that contained them and allow me to read them alone. Reading slowly and painfully was my only scholastic acquirement. The character of these exercises rapidly changed, until from unravelling the mystery of the simplest stories for children, I listened, with an astonishment and deligrht which I can never forget, to my guardian's reading of ' "The Lady of the Lake."                 The seed of a love for books was thus early planted, and I am indebted to the same hand, that it did not   spring up into a luxuriant and sickly growth. I had learned the relish, and should have become a literary gourmand but for the restraining guidance of my    i teacher. I have said that reading was my only accomplish- ment. This I had picked up at the little village school, where I had been sent out of harm's way, and beyond this I knew absolutely nothilg of what is taught in schools. My uncle decided that. I should learn, first and principally, the science of language, leaving all other branches of science and all other accomplishments out of present consideration, as naturally of secondary   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       101  order. This was the great fortress which I must sub-! due, and from which I might at leisure pursue my vie-  tory unopposed over the surrounding realms. But first the castle must be taken. His theory and method of  conducting the siege were, as I have reason to believe, the result of deep thought and extensive observation.  The plan was unique, and-since I am writing in con- fidence to thee, my dear Book--,it was successful.  My guardian drew for me, with much care and labor,  a few rules, divested of all superfluities and illustrated by paradigms, which I learned with great ease, and which gave me an insight into the whole fabric of the   :? Latin language. I became aware that language, whichj hadi been to me before, nothing, except a sponta- neons sign of want or of satisfaction, was a great machine, created with cunning combinations, and with diverse uses, philosophically adjusted to appointed   - movements and determined effects. I did not discover: this at once, but seeing dimly the shape of the various - ; parts, and hearing, as it were, the mysterious murinur and rustle of the machinery, my guardian drew aside the veil with his eloquent teachings, and exhibited the wonderful mechanism' in its beautiful and harmonious offices. I became suddenly possessed with a craving desire to know more. Speech, in my opened eyes, was a miracle. I constantly talked for the admiration of   - noticing the combinations of phrase with phrase. Lan- riOn .     102   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. guage became a new world, in my imagination, wherein the chapters were realms, and sentences families. Each word became invested with a soul, and moved on, with manifold uses, toward an individual destiny. My childish gratification, as I was permitted to read the immortal fables, was enhanced by the pleasure of tracing, step by step, word by word, the phraseological design, and of noting the perfection of each complete sentence; nor did these double pleasures make me weary of the more methodical and abstruse grammar which followed my guardian's easy lessons. And in this manner, with a morning and evening ride, with conversations to vary the employment through the long days, and with evenings passed in listening to my uncle's reading did I spend the next two years, and then, the first part of my task was accomplished. I   had learned the Latin language. I could read with ease, and correct appreciation of the mechanism at least, the sweet Georgics and faultless epic of the Mantuan bard. In Livy, and Tacitus, and Sallust, I had tra- versed great reaches of history; and inspired at a single draught, from Cicero's political orations, whole systems of partizan loves and hates. I had read in the summer meadows the idylic pastorals of Theocritus; had wearied myself over the sonorous tragedies of Terence, and had attempted, in vain, to fathom the beauty that might be in the odes of IIorace. These last, my uncle told   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       103 me, I was too young to comprehend. Alas, I have not:a yet grown old enough. I had thus learned, at the age of ten years, a language. With the exception of a little studying of geography,  and the acquired accomplishments of penmanship and orthography, I had learned nothing more.  We entered upon the second part of my task, the second division in my guardian's plan of the conquest-- with a systematic arrangement of time. In pursuance of the theory, of which my success should be the illus- tration and exponent, the greater share of my time was now devoted to a methodical comparison of the gram-; mars of other languages, with that of the language I  had already mastered, and with each other. My progress was so rapid and unhindered that I can only attribute it to the wisdom of the method of in- struction. In two years, I had, by these comparisons,  derived and inferred, rather than learned, the charac-  terizing qualities of the Greek, -French, German and English languages, and if I could not then, nor for a  long time afterwards, perhaps not yet very fluently--read the authors in each, my lack was of that nature, which can be supplied by practice, and only by that i In my fifteenth year, my guardian prescribed for me  a daily course of historical and general English reading, and less frequent courses in each of the languages mentioned. At the same time he contenced teaching *  ' i     104  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. me a system of mathenmatics. These exercises, varied under his supervision, have been continued up to the time of his departure. Thus have I epitomized for thy sake, my book, the history of my education, which indeed, comprises all the history I have. What more wouldst thou know, my dear companion? Already thou dost know where I live--at the home- stead, on Wahlen AWold. The Wold, the river, thle wood, the mountain, stop my darling, I will hold thee up to the window. Look out through the rain and see for thyself! My companions-alas, my chief companion, thou knows't has gone, and has left thee to be with me in his absence! Many of the people on the place, are good and kind, but they are not companions. As for the neighboring girls, they are away; Sarah Hunter at school in the North, and Nellie Powers in the City. They both write to me occasionally, but my dear Edith Gray is away, and I hear no more from her; she is dead. These young girls are the only ones with whom I have ever been intimate. Eugene Barbeyrac comes down in the summer time, with his grandmother to their old home; and while he is here, he comes and talks and reads with us every afternoon, and joins our evening ride. He is very pleasant and good, and we are always sorry when he goes. But these are all.

It was a year of strange experiences to Mabel. Her .  thoughts and reflections went fortl, at first, alone and  tremblinly, and came back without fruition, lament-   : ing for their accustomed guidelc-but gradually these    , moods left her. She began,- to feel curious, and with curiosity she gained courage. Her feet no longer shriank if shle trod inl some new path. Her eyes went  peering down in the vistas of' the labyrinth, wondering what mirht be bevlid ; and she felt impelled to wander   about alone. So she oained courange and habits of self- reliance; and longr before the year had passed, the tales ! she imparted to lher familiar, were more often joyous : than sad. That part of the manuscript-book which was writ- ten as this year wore on, by far the most voluminous   : portion of the Nwlole, is full of character, and deli- ! cious in its free and unfeigned naturalness. The pages sparkle with quaint conceits, joyous sallies, quiet rever- ies of hlappiiiess tinged with sadness, buovant hope for ': ' the future, with great-eyed wonder and haste to see that future open upon her. IHcre and there are fresh- toned little sonnets, written to sunsets, and clouds, and friendship, and sucel other gentle theimes as young maidens love to muse upon.

Here, too, are recorded such little souvenirs of unimportant events in the past, as make you feel to know and love the writer so much the better, for having heard the simple story. It is evident that you can not be entertained more pleasantly than by giving up the remainder of this chapter to two or three random selections from this year's work upon Mabel's journal-book.

When we walk to the ferry we cross this wood by a footpath, which is made convenient and beautiful   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       118 by two wooden foot-bridges across ravines. When we go to 'walk, almost always we turn to this wood, and there are many obscure paths that lead to quiet and  pretty places, where we study and read. There are  other paths still more obscure, that lead to more quiet  spots, where I go alone. I have said we. I had for- gotten that my dear guardian is gone. Alas, I shall] not now need to go to those more secluded places.? Now I am alone always.  When we used to ride, we would go up the moun- tain-road, or perhaps away on the turnpike, or some-  times to the village, and across the ferry, and down the  river-road to the Barbeyracs, or beyond, to the town,; five miles away.  Well, one day we had been reading a Scottish story,  in which every hill, and stream, and lake, every moun-  tain-peak, and field, and moor, had a picturesque or musical name. My uncle had seen these places, and told us that the scenery was meaner in every respect than ours; but, he suggested, the habit of giving the  features of any landscape fine names, soon invests it with a charm which a more beautiful, but unnamed  spot, can not possess.: "Ah," said Eugene Barbeyrac, for he was with us, "what a pity, since names are so potent to charm,--- what a pity that we have no names for these scenes  which are so lovely."7 ,! *     , '  ' I     "4  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. "How delightful," I added, "would it be, to ride to 'Coilantogle's Ford,' instead of. to ' Todd's Ferry.'" "Or to 'Loch Achray,'" joined in my uncle, "in- stead of Bittern Pond,' when we go to the hills." "Oh, yes," said Eugene, "and how romantic to say, when we see the black strip of cloud along the moun- tain, 'Benan's brow wears a frown,' instead of saying, ' There's a black snake in the hills.' " "And , oh, yes," I chimed in again, " and I wish the wood had a beautiful name, and the bridges, and the creek, and the ravines, and each little nook." "Thee'd better call it ' Up-and-down-Wood,' :' broke in hMartha Ruggles, who was sitting near us, ' for of all the places for little pitches, I'll allow I never see the like; and as for thy 'little nooks,' as thee calls 'em, I must say I can't see what some folks sees to admire in bugs all over their gowns. ' Spider's nests' I call 'em, and a proper namrne I'll allow. .For my part, I'd just like to be shut of that wood, and I wish, Reginald, thee'd cut it away, which I shouldn't have the least hesitation in doing so, ef I was trustee." We all laughed at this; for Martha has often lost' her way in the paths, which are plain enough, I think. Still we talked about naming our treasures, and finally determined to consider the matter, and come to our next first-day's afternoon walk, prepared to?risten everything worthy of a title. e   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE,       15 In the interval before first-day afternoon, my head was perplexed with multitudes of sounding names, but none, alas, were new. I hoped that the others  would be more successful.  "The river," said Eugene, when we were seated on a bank in the wood, from which our eyes could take in tlhe whole prospect, " the river is already well named;  ] it is unnecessary to re-christen it." To this we both agreed. "As to the hills," he continued, "I think we had better name only the high peak. If we have too many names to foster into general acceptation, we shall evi- dently neglect them. I have one name to propose for the mountain, and I think it a good one. I will sug- gest it after you have mentioned yours."  As he said this with an unusual air of importance, we grew very curious to hear the name, and declined making any proposition. "I would, then," said he, " name the peak ' Abadda.'" At this my uncle laughed very heartily. Eugene was confused, and appealed to me. "Why ' Abadda?'"I asked.  "Oh, I have no reason." "But should there not be a reason for fixing upon a mountain's name-which, thee knows, may be expected  \                             - ", 3 ;';^     "6  THE HEART OF MABEL WAIRN. to outlast even the hills?"I urged ; for I did( not like his name. "No need of that," he replied, "l e want a name, and I propose one. Why demand a reason? 'Abad- da' is an original word. It is sonorous, and has an ancient sound. lIow well it would ring in verse' "'Tile ligltning bathes Abadda's brow.' Does it not seem like a real old mountain named "' Eugene," asked my uncle, "l how did you happen to hit upon this name?" "Hit upon it?-why, it occurred to me, to-be-sure, spontaneously; and, as I liked the sound, and had not. heard the name before, I immediately adopted it." "But, Eugene," continued my uncle, "I think I can give a clearer account of this fine sonorous name than you have given :-You went home with your head full of this christening project. Whether you thought of mountain, wood, lake, river, or bower, armies of names trooped before you, and each ogled you fbr your choice. Paris was not more perplexed in choosing Aphrodite than you in selecting a name. Many of them were beau- tiful, but you had seen them or heard them all before. You were confused. You twere in despair. You re- solved to. fabricate an entirely new word to. answer your necessity."   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       117 "So far so good," broke in Eugene; " now how hap- pened I to fabricate Abadda?" "Listen my friend, and you shall know. Your essay was more difficult than you had anticipated. A happy, -  idea occurred to you. You would take the first prac-  ticable vowel in the alphabet. To it you would link the first convenient consonant. If it- should have an unobjectionable appearance you would add the first practicable letter, vowel or consonant. The same pro- cess would bear repetition. With such material as an alphabet, and with a plan so ingenious, you could make mountains of names. Names are words, words - are composed of letters. You knew the letters, and. could therefore produce combinations until you had in-  vented a name full of grandeur. You commenced your task. A struck you forcibly as a good initial letter. You might go farther and fare worse.- A was chosen. What should follow? Let us try. B- letus see. Bwill do. B is well. B is a miracle of aptness. What shall come next?  A is once more eligible. A is again available. A is, on the whole, one of the most useful letters in the alphabet."  Eugene again broke in: "You are a'conjuror." A" very simple one." "But how do you know all this, for it is true, to the letter?" "Once, I meditated an epic. Like Byron, I lacked a 6'*  r  6                    r -     "8  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. hero. A thousand names were at my command, but not one was new, and I thought all were trite. I re- solved a plan of manufacture, but found name-making more difficult than I could have believed. I went to bed to meditate. In half an hour I had achieved my hero's appellation, and sprang up to commit it to writing lest I should forget. I have given. you my plan of construction. The name I found the next morning was Abadda." "Wonderful" said Eugene, " but the epic?" "Oh, from a certain oriental sound in this word, I resolved that the theme should be an Arabian tale. But other and weightier matters came to claim my time, and for any thing I know, my muse still waits me in Araby the blest. Seriously, however, this name is not objectionable. Settle it between yourselves and I will be content; I used to climb that peak when I was a boy, and any name it bears will be dear to me." My uncle stopped and seemed lost in thought. Eugene whispered to me. We both spoke at once. The mountain was named "Reginald's Peak." TWe named, that day, a cave in the mountain, "De- serter's Lair;" because in the last war with Great Britain a deserter had sought refuge in it, defended himself from its entrance when pursued, and finally died in it. "Bittern Pond" we called "Maud Burton's Basin," after an old mad woman who used to haunt it.   THE  HEART OF MABEL WARE.      119 One of my pleasant seats in the woods, where there was  a wild rose, we called "The Bower;'" and another cool seat at the foot of the rocks, "The Grotto."  The merry little brook was named "Rock Chafer." After these, and many other things, had received their titles, my uncle, who had not named anything, called our attention to the long slope from the ridge, which we had just christened--' The Heights," to the river. "I think that 'Wold' will be a good title for it," said he, " yet Wold alone, would hardly suffice. What shall we add?" But we answered "No, we will waive our choice." Then he said, "You see all the walnut trees, that are clustered here and there over the place. Walnut- Wold seems to me the appropriate designation-      X Wahlen, however, the old Saxon word for walnut, may seem to you more quaint and pleasant. Which shall we choose?" How could we do otherwise than take the old word?  So I will here make an end of my long story.

Therefore should they, love themselves and life. Oh, the joy of being, when. Spring came that year, heralded by all his ushers of the white, and red, and green I Oh, the joy of motion, while her full veins thrilled with the strong pulses of health, as each morning she felt her swift horse-her dear Selim-bounding under her light weight I Oh, the joy of sight, as she reined the gentle steed upon some elevation, and stood motionless, like an equestrian statue, to do reverence to the rising sun I Oh, the joy of fancy, as she wove fantastic wreaths, and surveyed with quiet glee her crowned head in Rock Chafer's quietest inlet-pool; and, more, when she laid aside her book, and pondered of the sweet or brave, the stirring or consoling words she had read, and of the tales of romance which to her had been tales of realty I But Mabel had other experiences than these, that year. The sad moods of loneliness, " when her mind should be unperturbed by the excitements of life, and her heart be filled with strong yearnings for the high   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       125 and pure," which her uncle had foretold her, came now often and lingered long. Sometimes in her employ- ments and in her mirth, while she read or rode or walked, unbidden emotions-diverse as doubt and gratitude, urgent as fear, or calm as reverence-stirred her heart. But more than these, there were moments when all the current of her thought seemed to set toward the divine. In the long and bright days of summer, when the brightness above her was so brilliant, -and the still- ness about her so profound, that she grew sad and mute with the oppression of too much beauty, then came to her heart grave questionings and clamorous yearnings, to know of life, its heretofore--its destiny. Consciousness of another and vaster Presence about her than the air, and the earth, and the beauty, was heavy in her soul. She was dimly aware of God. She was painfully aware of the- mystery enshrouding Deity, and     longed to have pierced it at once. That principle of    1 our being which is termed faith--the intuition which is the genius and subtle perfection of reasoning--was      awakened. That innate necessity of the human soul,     (j which clamors for a theory of supernal causes and con-   I ditions to be acquiesced in and clung to,--began to be    hungry within her.                     - In the household of the money-loving Quaker, her father, religion was a constant and prevailing condition   I :  fi             I    -    lo^     126  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. of life. Thlle principal topics of conversation, pecuniary matters aside,--about these last, however, much less was said than done,--was the meeting then last or then next, the exhortations of " weighty members, " or of famous itinerant preachers, and the spiritual deal- ings of the brotherhood with derelict members. At heart, however, this religion was wholly worth- less and hollow. It answered no other purpose than to relieve the monotoiy of daily toil. It lent no high nor generous nor happy emotions to the quiet people who assumed it each morning as they assumed their orthodox garb; laid it aside as they laid their garments aside at night, and dropped their heads upon their pil- lows without religion as without clothes. The whole was a hollow form, a mere ceremony, life-longo indeed, but without grace and not at all august; a frame and body-a poor plain body, too-of a religion, without the life and soul of religion in it. No man seeking a faith to bind to his heart, and lean upon, could see in this, beauty or comeliness. Nay, more, whatever man should contemplate it, must pity its weakness and ab- surdity. Here was a form, a ceremony, and a soulless frame, lending its morbid existence to the task of strik- ing, feebly indeed, but with malice enough, against all other systems, because of their devotion to form; all other creeds on account of their ceremonial and arti- ficial nature, and the fabric of all other religions, with the absurd cry, L" hollow and heartless frame."   THE  HEART OF MABEL WARE.      127  Religion, which of all things should be-positive, and which is mos  t bright and pure when existing in spite of all antagonisms, grows poor and pale and little worth, when it descends to become itself a mere nega- tion; Reginald Ware himself, like a large proportion of the younger literary men of. his country and time, a freethinker on religious themes, sympathizing heartily with none of the various denominational creeds, had refrained, with characteristic delicacy of sentiment and with rare tact, from ever expressing in Mabel's hearing, ideas or suggestions, which might serve to give her young mind a bias. He had deemed it better, to leave her unadvised and unbent, until her age and mind should be mature. Whether a lurking doubt concerning the integrity.    of his own belief, and a disinclination to plant in the mind of the child seeds that might spring up to fruit which he himself should in the end be forced to deem pernicious, restrained him, I do not know.  This I know, that many men of severe intellect, of sound sense and  philanthropy, who in their own hearts-  utterly repudiate the doctrines of their spiritual teach- ers, and of the respective sects to which they may be attached, yet outwardly conform to, and refuse to pro- test against, such doctrines, contenting themselves for   i the self-denial of occupying a falsely understood posi-      128   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. tion before the world, with the wholesome reflection, that present systems are to a degree restraining and salutary in their character--and although they may be false, in many ways pernicious, yet such is the dispo- sition of mankind toward license, and such their need of control, that it is the wise part of conservatism to uphold even these bad systems, rather than to rush upon the anarchy which surely lies beyond any sudden release from any great restraint. Whether such rea- sons had weight with Mabel's guardian, I cannot tell; certain it is, that she was forced to form her own theory of supernal causes and conditions, before, in her ignorance, she could lend her acquiescence to any creed. That there was a God, she had always believed. She believed this like breathing. Her heart made him good, and her intellect invested him with attributes of wisdom and power. That she should live hereafter--how could she doubt it? And that her future might be cast with the future of those who surrounded her here, why might she not believe? That her life to come should be like this, changing and progressive, seemed a natural sequence of her Cre- ator's plan, and the only answer to an imperative neces- sity of her being. She was impressed with these convictions, and   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       129 adopted them to her belief, as simply as they stand written on the page above-almost without a palpable process of reasoning. Then, she loved the Good God. She reverenced the great Creator. She lifted up her voice in praise to the wise upholder of the universe. Then, she went backward in her fancy to other days when she had been unborn, to later days when she had been unconscious, to her lonely childhood--feeling the while a glow of divine gratitude as she thought that God's love had shielded her through all events, and brought her here. Then, she went forward, in her fancy, to when she should be dead, and wondered for the change, for the worlds that should receive her, and for the being she should become; and if, here, she felt fearful or appalled , at heart, she remembered, that God, who had shielded her always, would forever more be her guide, and pre- sently she was serene again. These emotions and their attendant convictions came not at once. They grew in her heart, as the Spring flowers grew, and ripened into peaceful fruits of hap. piness, with the fruits of autumn. In fine, she had, in a simple and untaught manner, won from solitude, and from beauty, and from her own prompting heart, these first dim experiences of religion. Creeds are vain. Soundness of basis, perfect whole- ness and perfect harmony of parts are not, in any theoe     130   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. logical system, understood among men. The fair white walls of religions, the buttresses, to the eyes of men founded as rocks, the shining domes of outward piety, tile towery heights of sublime confidence, and the very climbing spires of mingled importunate prayer and ecstatic praise, go up, indeed, through the unsubstantial slky, but the deep foundations of rock-where are they?  No worldly eye has ever seenthern. Worldly eyes are filled, indeed, with other sights, and worldly hearts recklessly assent; but of all who have cared to grope, not one has found the eternal, flawless bases of these great systems of creeds which have filled the world with their shadows. To faith and faith alone the depths are revealed. For faith alone they are. By faith alone they exist. To the faithless such temples are like the clouds, un- real. So much for systems, forms and creeds. But there is a truer thing in men's hearts than systems, vaster of import than these, perfect and whole as these are not, personal and high, where these are shared and shared to comparative vulgarity. There is a knowl- edge, so apparent, so absolute, so smiting-at-once, that the soul's impulsive obeisance mocks at forms. There is a recognition and a pure self-love, so pertinent, so terse, so needy, so all-in-all, that the heart feeling it: creeds you no creed, but springs out spontaneously, answering some hidden mnusic of its inner b(ing,r to rank itself in file with mankind, waiting for God's reviewal.

Stranger still, to see this man, who had never before been known to part with any smallest portion of his wealth without unwilling struggles of temper, now bidding his daughter prepare for such an expedition, instructing her the while to make such outlay in pre- paration as she should deem fitting, and never caution- ing her to limit her expenditures by an economical re- gard for her father's so nearly empty purse. Mrs. Barbevrac's invitations of a similar character, had not been wanting before; but hitherto they had only produced a close smile on the dry lips of the old money-lover. Your ear, gentle reader A secret! and mnind, it must not spread I! Perhaps its mention at all, wrongs this honorable man. Certainly be would not for a farm, that it should become known-just at this point at least. A secret! There is-you know it, my reader, how- ever brave and strong you may be; and I, too, I feel it well-there is for each one of us, a foe, grimy watchful, sure in the end to conquer us all, Death t We can not   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.        135 know, nor at all conjecture, when we may be over- come by some fierce onslaught that he may make; and this is our chief solace in respect of his terrors. It would be more dreadful to know that on some certain night-ten years away, perhaps --he should strike us down, than to be conscious that he may strike the fatal blow to-night. Well, sometimes it happens that this foe, with grisly courtesy as it would seem, sends an avant-herald to announce the coming of his Lord; and then, he who receives the message waits like a malefactor condemned, counting the hours that shall intervene before the sen- tence be complete. Men do not generally fear death. The King of Ter. rors is not a king whose name strikes us with awe. In his immediate presence, and when he oppresses us with sudden blows, we may indeed stand aghast; but it is rather by reason of bewilderment than from proper fear. The great army of mankind charge down the battle-ground of life, not like the stern squadrons of it chosen warriors,    ' "Misnamed forlorn, byll 1Who hold the thought of Death in scorn," : '$6 Not like them, plunging into some imminent deadly breach, whence only a mangled remnant shall ever come forth. We go to lie down in a breach whence it      136   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. not one shall rise up. In the midst of other desperate charges, bugles are borne, and breath hangs tremulous on the bugler's lips, ready, at a signal, to bring off the broken ranks of surviving heroes,--and poets, who sing the turbulence of the charge, and the fierce heat of it, sing no less, "Then they rode back again." But for us?-return?  Who dreams it? Yet awe mnarch on, undeterred, with firm feet, bearing our pied colors cheerily, and keeping step to our stately cadences undismayed. The foe strikes us down here and there, on this side, on that, sometimes in whole ranks, yet we do not shrink. Fall our brothers on our right hand, fall our brothers on our left, yet our pulses beat temperate music, and we march on serene of front. Sometimes, as the doom hovers above us, we feel thle deadly faintness of fear at our hearts; but straight be- thinkin, us a moment, we fall with decent serenity. Yet almost always our hearts are stout and brave. With grace, mournful it may be, but stately, we bend forward to meet the blow. Even those who are clown- ish, slow of wit and coarse of mood, grow dignified and gentle at the last. MAany, perhaps most, would fain continue for a little time, the conversations they are holding with their friends and neighbors of the ranks, and many shrink   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       137 with tears from relinquishing these employments, but this is not fear. James BWare-and this is the secret-had seen such an avant-herald. The message was, that the grim king was only just behind. A consuming disease had reached out its hand and was slowly closing its gripe around the miser's heart. No aid could stay that hand, and he knew that when the grasp should be complete, his heart would be turned to stone, and so, he would be dead. But when he became conscious of this, Oh what a mortal agony of fear fell upon him! He shrank away from the doom with a persistency of repugnance that almost made him mad again. He moaned and howled in desperate and unmanly fear, and stamped the ground and gnashed his teeth with wicked rage. But this and other similar paroxysms were brief and infrequent, when sometimes the corroding thought would over- master his more temperate moods.  Reason would regain quick control, and again, to the eyes of all observers, he was the same crafty, formal Friend. A strange pride, also, now'took possession of him, to conceal this mtalady, with more solicitude than he would have' felt for the blackest shame. He begged his phy- sician to hold it in dreadful secrecy. Often he .thought it was discovered, and that all eyes were turned upon him, as waiting for a, calamity to strike; but still the men came and went, and made contracts with him     138  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. which years could not complete; and he took a strange pleasure in this sort of defiance to his adversary. He dreaded the humiliation of turning away these men, and saying, "Go your ways and traffic among the living, for I am as one dead;" for he, too, in his way was proud. Another reason withheld him from de- claring his malady. lie feared that all men would shun to deal with him, and that his increase would sufler. So James Ware harbored his secret with his disease, twin guests in his heart; and in fact one gnawed there as keenly as the other. But he looked upon his daughter now with other and more anxious eyes. He began now in fact to see her, for the first time, as his destined representative-the heiress of his fortune and his name-for before he had never thought of a residue of time whiclh might perchance remain after his life- and he felt now that she was to be alone. Secretly he almost wished that his brother might forget all differ- cnce, and return to be with her when he should be with lher no more. Dismissing this thought as hopelessly impracticable, he began to cast about him for some one to whorm he migrlt consign a trust, which now ie began to suspect might be precious. He looked in vain. Triflinl, but insuperable objections cut off oie and an- other of his acquaintances, from the possibility of suc- cession, until none remained. It was strange that t   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       139 Eugene Barbeyrac, who was also a favorite, almost the only one, with the old Quaker, did not occur to him at all in his anxious canvassing. Mrs. Barbeyrac, who, as has been intimated, was stately and proud, was, for all that, fond arid over- weening in her anxiety for the future of her grandson. With his father's fortune, the young orphan had inher- ited all that father's share of his mother's widowed heart. And this stately lady, too, older than James Ware, fell, like him, into similar trains of speculation. She, too, went, now and thena casting forward in her mind, to the time which could not, she knew, be far away, when the boy upon whom her hopes were cen- tred, and to whom her solicitude was wholly given, should be without her care. As she thought of this, she grew sad for his loneliness, and anxious to antici- pate what well or ill-chosen partner might share and alleviate it. But, unlike James Ware, whenever she thought, she was quite successful in making her choice. One nane, and only one, was before her. She dreamed nights of Eugene and Mabel. One day when the Barbeyraes had taken Mabel to  ride, and brought her home, Mrs. B. dismissed her horse, seated herself by the crafty Friend on the piaz- za, and While the two children, yet unsatisfied, were cantering around the gravel carriage track on the lawn near the house, the two fell somewhat into this mood of conversation:  -        '-,1MS'      "O  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. "James, thee ought not to keep so fine a girl away down here at the Wold, by the twelve-month together. Thee knows she is almost, and for that I may say quite, a woman now, yet she has hardly ever slept a night where she might not see Reginald's Peak from her window, while all the neighbors' children have at least been a few quarters to some boarding-school." "I am told, friend Margaret, by those who admire such vanities, that Mabel excels all the children in the borough, in such of the branches of what they are pleased to term an education, as seem to be the most de- sirable, such as a knowledge of strange tongues, and the like; and if she can not vie with them in such follies as singing, dancing, and painting and embroidering, which indeed I esteem not only follies but absolutely pernicious and sinful, why thee can well understand that I am not uncomfortable in that regard, but am rather inclined to rejoice that the child has avoided such snares of the adversary. And as for thy wonder that Mabel is found almost always at home, why how should it be with a woman?" "Nay, James, I did not mean that Mabel had suf- fered from the loss of the boarding-school discipline, for indeed, she is better learned than any young girl that I know; and for that very reason, I think thee will allow that a young woman like her, might with profit see a little more of the world than she is ever like to see here."   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       141 "Thee knows Margaret, how I esteem the vanities of the world. Thee knows, too, how prone is human nature, and more especially the mind of youth to be smitten with its hollow gaieties; and come to love what is unlovely and unbecoming-that which profiteth little to the soul. Ought I not, then, to be glad that my daughter is so far removed from these dangers, and would I not incur the charge of rashness and im- prudence, if I should send her where she would be less protected than she now is?" "But, James, it is not necessary that all who see should embrace. Eugene, there, has seen much of the world, and yet he is uncontaminated." "Eugene is a good lad." "And, James, thee knows we may die." "Why--what, what is that thee says, Margaret? Oh yes, we may die, very true-we may die. Look, that stallion of Eugene's has fretted himself to a foam I 'Tis a free horse." "I say, James, we may die, and our children may be left alone. Ought we not to arm them with whatever weapons, experience and a knowledge of the world may lend? I confess to thee James, that I know I am old and fond, and not wise, that my protection is im- potent, and my counsel worthless, yet I can not con- template the loss which my poor boy will suffer when I am gone, without shuddering, and I am constantly 7*     "2  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. anxious for his future. Do thy thoughts for Mabel ever run in the same channel, James?" "Why Margaret I tell thee, thy fingers now come near to touch the very spring of my present fears and anxieties. I too-perhaps-may die, though I am yet, as thee knows, but a young man; yet I may die; and it perplexes me greatly to fancy what difficulties and em- barrassments might be in store for Mabel. I tell thee, Margaret, I would be greatly relieved, if the girl were married to some discreet man, of my own choice." Then there fell a silence, and the two watched the flushed faces of the riders as they passed now around the lawn, and now up and down the long lane. They were gay, and their laughter mingled its tones and reached the ears of the sitters. As they turned at the foot of the lane, and came galloping up toward the house, Mrs. Barbeyrac commenced again. "Erugene too must be married; James, I will give thee a thought. Thee sees them as they ride! they are, to my thinking, a beautiful and well-matched pair. I would they were mated for life." James Ware started. It was a new thought indeed: "Eugene-Eugene, and Mabel? Eugene is a sober lad." "And, James, thee knows Eugene's property is mostly hereabouts." "Mabel and Eugene? Margaret, I tell thee I will con- sider of this matter." Then the happy riders came up with glee and laughter.   Be wary of beastye, And wary of song, All wives who in duty Would be wifely strong.

AND therefore it was, that when the next week, Mrs.  Barbeyrac sent her formal invitation to Mabel, with the accompanying request for permission to her father, James Ware granted approval to his daughter, already desponding at the thought of having to decline a pro-  posal which seemed to her so desirable. Therefore wondered Mabel, and therefore perplexedly cross- winked Martha Ruggles. James Ware had considered. The two names would not, night or day, leave ringing in his brain. "Mabel and Eugene,- Eugene and Ma- bel?-and Eugene was agood lad, a sober lad, verily,"  and it was true, as Margaret had suggested, that Eu- gene's property was mostly thereabouts, too. The  heart-sick miser had considered. Then came hurried preparations which bewildered the whole quiet house, and Mabel most of all. The day for their departure was settled and changed, and settled again, and had dawned. Mabel's trunks had * I     "6  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. stood the usual waiting-hour on the platformn of the piazzi, and liad at last been securely bestowed on the foot-board of Mrs. Barbeyrac's carriage. Eugene, who had corne to bring her to his grandmother's, whence they were to start for the station, had waited, hat in hland, while her father, Martha Ruggles, the kitchen- naids, hler dog, her birds, and even the rooms of the hlouse, lad received her weeping farewell. The hieart of this simple young girl, clinging to her home because it was the only spot on earth which she felt to know and trust, shrinking from the undertaking upon whch she had entered with such lively joy, terrified at the startling nearness of the world which she longed for and yet dared not invade, was overwlelmed with poignant and unfeigned grief, at this first thoug him- portatnt rending of such ties. No one who has'not like lier been :allowed to grow up in close intimacy and affection with the characteristics of a single landscape, tlhe features of a single scene, in solitude there, too, and ill ignorance of what may be beyond, until they have attained the estate of manhood or womanhood, and then, lhave been suddenly ushered, away into a strange world, molre strange by the painting of a vivid imagci- naltion, can fully appreciate the terror and really im- iortant grief which took possession of this poor novice. Thie last parting word was said, and the carriage- wlhecls went remorslessly rolling down over the gravel   THE  HEART OF MABEL WARE       147- road, every pebble of which was so dear to her; and when, just before they were about to go behind the      wood. which would shut away the scene henceforth, she leaned forward to take the parting gaze -she could not at all see it for the blinding of the tears in her eves. She cast 'herself back in the carriage and sobbed aloud. Then, the carriage seemed to go more slowly. Then,  the dazzling beams of the autumn sun were warded off by the intervening branches. Then, the subdued song of birds in the close covert, and the scent of unseen flowers, in whose shaded chalices the dew-drops re- mained ungilded and pellucid, came in and assailed her senses with soothing influences. A spirit of the bird-songs, and a sister spirit of the flowers' breath, seemed to come and stroke her hair with their spirit touches, to fan dry the tears, and cool the smarting channels they made on her cheek; and, it seemed the while, that their voices came almost impalpable, yet unbewildered and distinct, in sweet beguiling hints of pleasure, and short absence, and return. It might be that, or it might be that Eugene found means to be- guile her of her grief and soothe her into smiles; for then, while the shade was cool, and the odors sweet, and the songs most thrilling, just then his arm was drawn around her firmly and sustainingly, as if to sup- port her in a trial so severe. It was the first time since     "8  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.  they had been children, hand-in-hand wanderers of wold and wood, that his arm had clasped her in that way, but she did not repel him. Why should she shrink? It was Eugene. Only Eugene, her brother; and indeed, she felt grateful for the assurance of sym- pathy which the caress seemed to convey. And then, when his other hand gently drew away her hands from her weeping face, and smoothed her disturbed hair, she saw that his eyes were full of love-or of pity, as she thought, which, in the case of so young a man, and on behalf of a beautiful and weeping woman, is not a very different thing for the moinent--why then she felt still more grateful, still more disposed to lean upon his su- perior knowledge of the great and terrible world-his superior manliness and firmness and experience; there- fore she was not troubled when he bent over her and kissed her tears away, and drew her still closer in his arms; nor when, kissing her tears quite away, he left these, and pressed his lips once and again, and more and more passionately to her beautiful mouth. On the contrary, she could well have returned the caresses, so far from being shocked and grieved at them. And so, alone with her and the beautiful morning, stirred with pity for Mabel's grief, stirred with admira- tion for her tearful beauty, stirred with manly pride to feel her dependence on his manliness, and stirred with passion to hold this beautiful woman in his arms, and   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       149 unhindered to kiss her sad face, .Eugene Barbeyrac as-  sumed qualities of manhood which he had never before possessed. He sprang all at once to a stature too lofty and imposing for his nature. For the hour, he became gifted with a potent and chivalrous character, to which there was nothing in the natural scope and fabric of his  - soul giving him a right. He wore for the time such qualities as might win any woman's heart.  Accordingly, when, at this most auspicious moment,  he declared his affection, and sought with a persuasive eloquence not his own, but lent him by the combina- tion of chances and the hour, to lure from her favoring  responses, and to kindle in her heart an answering    ! passion, he was not wholly unsuccessful. It was not by any artifice that Eugene had taken a  time so favorable to declare his passion. He could not  have anticipated the effect upon Mabel of her. grief.  He could not have stooped to take advantage of her  excitement and loneliness, to win from her an acknowl: edgement from which her calmer hours would revolt In fact, he was himself: quite as completely, as unex-  pectedly, surprised and hastened to his present position; as Mabel had been. He had long loved her, but onlyI lately had he begun to acknowledge to himself, that her love was a necessity of his happiness; and since he    ;i had realized this conviction, he had grown shy and     ;J timid in her presence; fearful, lest now that the thought : i : 7     150  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. had so grown around his heart, she might suddenly be torn away and lost to him forever. He had not ven- tured to communicate his secret even to his grand- mother, but had nursed it in silence, and unhappy.  Suddenly the opportunity, with the favoring surround- ings, presented itself. He impulsively reached out his hand and plucked the coveted fruit, unopposed. His heart swelled with exulting happiness. He was radiant with joy. His high hope and apparent delight were contagious. Mabel, too, was carried away with the excitement, and when they were joined by the stately dame, whose motherly heart was so warm and so entirely their own, that the thought of concealing their happiness from her did not at all occur to either of them, they knelt with mutual and equal fervor to reveal their love and to demand her sanction. Upon her, too, the happiness came unexpectedly. She had hoped, but the realization of her hoping had not seemed so near. She blessed them with words full df grateful joy, and bound their betrothal by her wit- nessing consent. So the rest of that journey was not grave or terrible. And here, let me say to the gay and fashionable people who will smile with incredulity to read of this old-fashioned impulsive method of love-making in real life, that the heroine was not one of them; that her habits and experiences, her estimates and standards   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE       1 51   were wholly unlike theirs; that it is hardly possible  X for them, living artificially as they do, to comprehend  the quick forming motives, the impulsive and improvi- dent actings of one who was a very child of nature, untutored and unpanoplied.                 How indeed can it be fair, reader, that you, who have received flattery and homage from earliest girl- hood-taught always too, to receive it serenely, and    A regard it precisely like a presented bouquet, with plea-  sure if it be prettily wrought, with slight regard if it .be I a bun-gling bit of work, but with toleration if it be well-imeant and kindly--how is it possible that you,   : now, should be able to understand and appreciate tho effect upon one like yourself at heart, but lacking your experience, of a first ardent passionate proffer of devo- tion and manly love? 'You would smile at the thought of allowing such a proffer, to make you pale and red by turns, to make you weep and feel faint, to win fromn you a sign or token against your will. Very good for you, fair lady! but this child, ah, it was different with ' her.  No more can you comprehend' how deep a grief it was to Mabel, to leave this home of hers, only for a winter; how serious a thing to go out facing the un- known world, for her who had looked upon it always from so far away. The people, coming from beyond,  to mingle a little with the quiet people there, came not     152  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. with their work-a-day garments, but in holiday attire; came not with the plodding step with which they would have trodden their own floors, but with the fresh mien and the springing step of men, who, for the time, throw care and toil away, and set themselves to drive somefete day's hours on wings. They bore not about them the traces of daily labor, and if any dust clunc to their garments, or any lassi- tude dwelt on their lips and brows, it was the inspiring weariness of far-coming pilgrims, the glittering golden dust-to young eyes glittering and golden-of old and strange countries. And so she dreamed, naively enough I grant you, that life out of sight of Reginald's Peak, was not plodding and common-place, but significant and strange. Besides, I have not spoken of the birds whose voices, the flowers whose perfumes, the glowing morning air whose embraces, reached and surrounded her with their influences, without a meaning. This young girl was as quick and responsive to all sensuous motions, and touches, and breaths-however subtle-as ever any dreamy-eyed dame, whose undulant form and dainty feet, and fair, fair hands did press the amorous couches in the wanton-odored halls of Sybaris. These spirit-voices therefore, assailed her senses, quickened by the tumult and the grief of parting, with a more potent influence of languor than seems credible in the estimate of one not similarly sensitive.

She had been separated, partly by inclination perhaps, but chiefly by circum- stance, separated, to an unhealthy and unnatural ex-  tent, as I think, from the gentle kindly intercourse with  women, which she ought not to have been without  .  Ah, it would have been a different story-the story of Mabel Ware, but for this one peculiarity and lack in her education.

But if, my fair readers, to return, if you still smile at this speedy, informal method of wooing, this easy, unex- pected winninag, and still say "it is but a trifling arti- fice of the romance-weaver," why then--not to argue with you too long-I refer you to your gay brothers- who know better about these matters than you do, to ask them, how long a time they would require, to win from a young girl, wholly inexperienced in love and in life, weeping too over some half-imaginary grief, re- quiring sympathy and support-a young girl sweet and beautiful, just entering in from the doorway of woman- hood, romantic, ambitious, filled with aspirations and confidence-how long a time they would require to win from such an one, a token of love?

'Twas as if every cubic inch of Regnald's Peak, should have been perfo- rated, and hordes, and shoals, and worlds of ants should come the live-long day, go the live-long day, in blind yet orderlyevolutions-never resting, never pausing-- but keeping up through the heart of the great moean- same antics, for the crowd to1admire. 7Twas as if every     160  TtIE HEART Of AtABEL WARE, tain, a perpetual unresting movement, without hope of relaxation. At first, Mabel had wonder and thought that must be bestowed upon the luxurious appointments, the gaiety and bustle, the order that prevailed amidst the apparent disorder, and the perfect understanding which every one, except herself, seemed to possess, of the cus- toms of that kind of life which prevailed in the great Hotel that received them. Then the City, with its constantly-recurring freshness, its new phases, its con- trasts, its broadly-hinted mysteries, its open and para- ded poverty, wretchedness, and crime, startled her, and fed her soul with novel wonders. But when, after the first few bewildered days, she be- gan to adopt a routine of daily life, even in the midst of confusion which at first seemed so great,-then, when she began to be able to rescue from the pressure of engagements which could not be disregarded, little snatches of solitude, she became aware of tumultuous reflections, vague and unsatisfactory, on the new rela- tions which seemed to close around her, without bid- ding, and, as it appeared at times, strangely unwelcome. This suddenly-projected alliance, to which she had yielded her assent without a shadow of unwillingness, now assumed a grave import of meaning, which it had not seemed to wear at first, and she longed for time to think, and to gaze upon it as it approached, threatening ,$.   THE HEART OF, MABEL WARE.       161  as it came-so it seemed to her-to swallow her up  from herself for ever. She felt no shrinking from her future husband. Her  intimacy with him had been too close and too long for that. She thought of this, and it, too, perplexed her. She was sure that if she did not love him, his presence  would now be repulsive to her; that his touch would call up and alarm all the revolting guards of her senses, I that his kiss would have for her the sting of a blow.  But she could not'make it so. She could not feel that involuntary repugnance and drawing away from  his intimate intercourse, which she felt sure she must feel  in the presence of an unloved lover. It seemed that: she might as well shrink from her own guardian; as     from  Eugene. Even his caresses did not trouble her. Indeed she had an ardent affection for him, and a less refined woman would have mistaken the sentiment for the passion. Whoever loves curiously to investigate the laws of the judgment, the influences which lead and shape it, or the lawless legality, the unreasonable integrity of the heart, would find the various exercises of this young girl's judgment and affections--as vaguely indicated in the now hurried and brief entries in her journal-an' I interesting and fruitful study; but contemplated in the light of Mabel's future history, the study suddenly takes a  graver import, and curiosity is lost in awe.     162  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.         ' If you wish to find the most fragile and delicate of all beautiful flowers, you shall not breathe the enervat- ing air of artificial summer in the conservatory for ex- otics. Go to the bleakest and most fearful precipice,  where hardy pines and toughest roots are hardly able to endure the rigor of the searching airs. Go in earliest spring, and in latest autumn, and there, while the melt- ing snow shall have hardly ceased to fill full the spring torrents, you shall find the pale and beautiful primrose; and there, when the gusts of late autumn begin to rave fearfully down the glens, and go muttering terrible things up the shaking passes, you shall find a flower, tiny and pallid, but more perfectly wrought than any rose that ever flushed summer dew in its bosom's cha- lice-more wonderful of tint than any regnant lily that ever tossed her head for other flowers to envy; a flower so ethereal, and lovely, and pure, that if you twine around its stem the waxen fingers of your dead child's hand, it will pass unchallenged, and unhindered into paradise, and bloom on unabashed, beside whatever flowers may bloom in heaven's fields. Nor is it a thing to wonder at, except with the calm and happy wonder which is not born of surprise, but which is the parent of worship, and which all appropriateness of all created things, may, in the same manner awaken. It is a beau- tiful but not a rare provision of Nature's Architect. The roughest surroundings almost always produce the   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       163 most refined manifestation of whatever lovely thing we  consider. Mossflowers and lichens are seen in their most perfect development, through the thin sheathing, of ice, when the wintry rains can hardly fall before the drops are congealed. The. roughest shell harbors the serenest pearl. The poorest and coarsest mould of earth was washed away when the richest diamond -lay  bare. And when the smiting gusts strike away, -from his high and dizzy place on the shrouds, some hardiest sailor boy, and the cruel waves give him no more back again, it may be, that the warmest heart in a world grows cold in the dead man's breast. Away cut there in the quiet and homely country,  surrounded by people who are by the tenets of their creed, and by their habits of life, and by clannish cus-: tom, fanatics-warring through life with life's dearest amenities, hostile in purpose to the refinements which tend to mollify and disarm purposes of hostility, and practising rude contempt for such gentle and kindly influences of civilization as polish practice from con-  temptuous rudeness;-among these " weighty mem- bers" of the country meeting, their weighty wives, their meek sons and their restrained daughters, Mabel had grown up as unartificially as the mountain-flower, as serene as the pearl, as unrestrained of instinct and intuitive perception as the diamond of brilliancy and glow, and with a noble and gentle heart.     164  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. True she had had the influence of her uncle, and the society of the Barbeyrac's. So had the flower the sun- beams and the summer breezes; so had the pearl the miglty swing of the free ocean, and large glimpses up- ward along the trembling, translucent walls. And the diamond, too, had sunshine and winds; and the sailor's heart many and many a kindly word that purified like a benediction. Mabel went forward, day after day, towards the con- summation of her girlhood with fitful and feverous starts, and involuntary shrinkings back as if fom some dreaded but intangible evil. It did not occur to her, tlat she might cast off the engagement and stand once more free and happy. She had no word to say, in an- swer to the question which would be asked her, "Wherefore?"She had no reason that seemed more than a phantasy, for the apparent inconsistency of such an act. More than either, she had not time to make the resolution, and to form the plan. A single doubt, a doubt not acknowledged as a hope, yet blindly-fos- tered, was in her heart. She was almost sure that her father would refuse to sanction the betrothal. Eugene was not by birth a member of the Society to which she was attached, and although for her own part she could hardly conceive how such an accident could be a bar- rier to their union, yet she knew well how insuperable it would appear to her orthodox father; and she fore-   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.      165 saw that he would recall her with violent and rude haste to her home. Already the letter petitioning his consent to their betrothal had been despatched, and the answer was due. Mabel would have been shocked, if she could have discovered how sure she was, that that answer would be a refusal, and how complacently she' looked for its arrival,--but she was deceived. It came, and with it came her father's free consent, and his request that the affair might be hastened. In- deed, he was of opinion that it had better be consum- mated at once, and he promised to come to the city to attend the wedding, at any time, on the briefest notice. This was quite in accordance with Mrs. Barbeyrac's plans, and with Eugene's wishes. Mabel felt a desper- ate longing, even now, to break away, but now more than ever she was unable. Now, another angry ques- tioner would ask, "Wherefore?" and, no more than before, had she a word to say. And now, too, a des- perate impulse came upon her, to hasten the sacrifice, when, at least, she thought, there would come repose. The time, therefore, was fixed, and she gave her con- sent. She heard it announced to one after another of the family acquaintances and trembled, but never trembled with joy. So passed the winter, bringing an unceasing variety of incidents of ordinary character and tame enough to others, but to Mabel significant and eventful. It left 8*     166   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. her no time for reflection, at the most critical time of her life. Her soul was filled with a tremulous voice that bade her pause, but a thousand voices called her hurriedly away to scenes that forbade her to think. She went on without volition and without pleasure-- without shrinking, yet filled with apprehensions. Her introduction to society; the quick-following par- ties and balls and gay pleasures; the conversation of brilliant men, and the patronage of queenly women;. the wonderful drama, that stole away her soul and bore it down the stately march of the sublime tragedies to their fearful catastrophes; the opera, that thrilled her with delicious senses of happiness,--all these com- bined to hurry her away from thought. Then her father came up to the city, and seemed strangely anxious to do what he might to complete the affair. Sometimes he was almost childish in his impa- tience at the necessary delay. The few papers which were deemed necessary were complete, and remained in his impatient hands days before they could be exe- cuted. He seemed now too, to have forgotten even the ties of his sect. He forgot to insist, until Mabel reminded him, that her marriage should be celebrated in the plain style ; and when Mrs. Barbeyrac proposed a compromise by an arrangement of two ceremonies, one of ostentatious plainness, and the other of ostenta- tious pomp, he fell in with the plan so readily that Ma-   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       167 bel felt shocked at his utter absence of care, concerning a matter which she knew he deemed a matter of con- science. Now, indeed, for a little time, Mabel was withdrawn partially from the entanglements of society, but even now, many arrangements for the approaching ceremony filled all the hours, and besides, now that it was so late-the brink so near, she felt irresistibly impelled, herself, to go forward more hastily and realize the worst, or learn to laugh at all that she was fearing Then came the double ceremony. The sacrifice was complete. Away went the heart-sick miser down to his country home, to wait again for death, and to make long forth-reaching engagements of business, by way of deluding himself into the attitude of an unsub- stantial defiance of the tyrant who would not cease from oppressing him; and away went his daughter and his new son, to mingle in the increased and long con- tinued festivities of the occasion. They came a gay if, not a happy bridal party to the capital, to participate like many another gay bridal party in the culminating splendors of the late season-and there, the excitement of political debate by day, and the glare of metropoli- tan life at night, the flattering homage- of men whose   i names had been familiar to her ears so long that their  bearers seemed by necessity far-off, and heroic, the presence of distinguished people from the far away  :.Mi     168  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. countries, in their national characteristics, and in fine, all that renders society in the national metropolis so bewildering to a novice in social dissipation, combined to bewilder her. All the crowding circumstance and pomp of this first winter Mabel had spent away from poor tame old Wahlen Wold seemed to sweep her away from herself, and bear her on with the rest around her, in step and time like a roll of drums. Afterwards when they came in the early summer, jaded and weary, to their country-home, she looked back upon the reckless dissipation of the time with wonder and with terror. Now that she began to think once more calmly and temperately, she began to ap- prehend all the significance and force of the vows she had taken upon herself at the altar. The indissoluble and eternal relation into which she had entered, and to shudder at the fatal thought. One duty was evident enough, namely: to assimilate by every cheerful sacrifice of what might be mere tem- porary conceits and whims, by every womanly pro- priety of pride and duty, by every wifely conformity to a single standard of tastes, habits of thought and aspi- ration, heretofore similar enough, but now strangely revolting at the thought of bonds, and incontinently starting away at the approach of necessary equations and standards.   Sternest lessons that are taught Destinie impartes; Is pale patience to be wrought In rebellious heartes?

He was happy in loving his beautiful wife, but still not acquir- ing day by day that dignity, that growth of manliness which a proud and thoughtful woman will look to see in the man to whom she has given herself away. Hex was utterly ignorant of the terrible suspicions of unfit- ness which haunted the mind of Mabel. He could not comprehend that she was not as happy as himself. Mabel meanwhile was at school. Fate was her pre- ceptor, and filled her weary hands with tasks which' seemed hopeless, but which were for the doing, and  which must be accomplished. Sometimes she drooped in exhaustion and faintness, but ever she revived. Her heart was brave and high. She wandered through  a thousand glooms of doubt and despondency, with courage often faltering, always sorely tried, but never \ .' - "     172  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. wholly deserting her to complete despair. Ever serene and lovely, her sedulous hand held tight the veil that covered her true face from her husband, knowing that like Khorassan's followers, he could not look and live. So the summer wore away. They rode through the old haunts, and walked to the wood, and over the slope, as had been their wont in the days that Mabel sighed but to look back upon. Suddenly a great stroke fell upon the house, and they all trembled and bowed down before the terror of it. The strong man, still concealing from the world and from his own household the secret which his phy- sician and himself had hitherto held fearfully between them, all at once with a terrible outcry gave it forth, and made it shockingly public. So now we may speak of it more freely. It was the dim twilight. No lights were yet brought to the wide old parlor, and a gloomy pall of gathering darkness hung over the group, hiding them from each other. Mabel sat in a window, watching the fading out of the last rosy tints in the western sky. She was sick at soul, and the silent but eloquent voice of her repin- ings was loud at her heart. Eugene, who had been reading, had fallen into a pleasant revery after the dark- ness had shut the pages of his book away. The old man, always taciturn, and now hardly speaking at all for days together, except to the men who still came to   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       173 do business with him, was seated in a dark corner in another part of the room. The family had that very day received intelligence, through the public journals, that Reginald had accepted an office in an American embassy. All at once in the darkness, the heart-sick miser began, in a shrill voice that made his listeners shud- der, and with eager haste of utterance, to exculpate himself from sins which no man had ever charged at his door. His voice grew more shrill, and his utter- ance so rapid and tremulous, that his words could not be distinguished. His family thought that some new form of his old lunacy had suddenly attacked him. They hastened to summon the servants. Lights came, but, oh I the terror of the group that clustered about the wretched old man. He had stopped speaking now. A strong convulsion was racking him. His crafty eyes, still crafty in their deathly expression, protruded from their sockets. His face was purple, and its muscles frightfully rigid. One hand was locked in his saintly white cravat, in a desperate endeavor to wrench away the impediment that would not let him breathe, while the other went cleverly about seeking, with ludicrous and awful propriety, to restore to its place his tongue, which, hanging far out, had been bitten nearly off. Then Death came, and sought to bear away its vie- tim. But, Gods I what energy was lent him by despair.    l   ,             i 7     174  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. He sprang to his feet. His voice came out incoher- ently indeed, but uttering husky roars of agony and terror. He bounded to and fro through the narrow space, unhindered by the strong arms that sought to restrain him, like a mad lion in its cage. With both hands now leaving his throat and his hanging tongue, he clutched fearfully at his heart, and threw himself against the ghastly by-standers, with imploring looks for aid. Now he went blind, and, still huskily and in- coherently roaring, he rushed to and fro, and beat his head against the uncaring walls until he fell mangled to the floor, whence he could no more rise. One by one his gasps grew longer in their intervals and fiercer in their throes, and then his rigid muscles relaxed one after the other, until he lay wholly unaware; and after, I know not if ever he schemed another plot or no. James Ware was gathered to his fathers. Small as had. been Mabel's commerce with her father, and hard and ungenial as had been his temper, there was yet in her heart a strong sense of filial affection. She mourned, therefore, with sincere and daughterly grief, as they laid him away under the cold ground for ever. But there was something more than this sudden rup- ture of the ties of natural affection--something in the unexpected falling down of one upon whom she had been accustomed to look as a permanent tower of   THE. HEART OF MABEL WARE.      175        strength,-more significant than any mere awakening of filial grief. It taught her as she had never been taught before, for never before had she looked upon Death, the instability of Life. It made her heart sick to feel how fearfully brief and unstable might be all her joys and griefs. It left her too, with a pensive consciousness, that however painful the course of life might be, however much and wearily she might endure,  yet it would soon be at an end,--it would soon be at an end. So she turned her more resolutely, and with fewer thoughts of failure now, to learn the lessons that Fate was giving into her hands.- Winter came again. This winter they were not go- ing from home. Mabel was pensive, but serene out- wardly; and Eugene, recovered from the shock which Death had shaken the whole house withal, went on treading a sunny path as before. But now Mabel had another theme for anxiety and       thought. She had now partially subdued the fearful whirl of emotions which at first used to take her breath away, as she thought. She had learned to look upon the significance of the marriage vows she had taken calmly, almost without emotion, except an indefinite yearning of desire in her breast-a haunting demon of unrest that would not be assoiled. She had now begun    ! to look calmly out to- the future, and to connect her destiny in her thoughts with their mutual destiny. - ,            176  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. Oh, Fate is a rigorous and successful schoolmaster. And in Mafbel he had found, too, an uncomplaining, a hard-striving pupil. It was not wonderful, then, that progress had been made. Sometimes, indeed, she failed to master some task at the first trial; but she never shrank from wholesome castigation; nay, she even added to her preceptor's discipline unnecessary peniten- tial stripes. It was not singular then, that the disci- pline was attended with marked success. But now Fate was about resorting to another method. He was about to adopt a system of rewards; and he looked to see Mabel make a rapid stride to complete success, when she should be the mnother of Eugene's child.   But how strong soe'er Fate's curb, 'Tis not alwayes used; Some fierce passions that perturb, Are to be amused. And right well the teacher knows, Whether boons or whether blows- Whether sharpe strokes or milde art, Sureliest will sway the heart; Though at times, be it confessed, Erring wide, plies lie his guest.        : Every mother loves her young, Blesses it wi' hearte and tongue ;  And ye mother would hide well, I)arkliest to hide in hell, Who, by other love is 'guiled, To forget to love her childe.

I introduce no phase of character, no series of incident, nor any development of affection or passion merely to enhance the interest of the plain-going nar-  rative. The story is simple and easy to tell in a direct ^  style, and, as I think, sufficiently interesting and dra- matic in its natural sequences, without the adventitious - aid of rhetorical arts, if, indeed, I had them at corn-! mand.

The hearty re- sponsive duty and content which might have been looked for almost without doubt, was not altogether realized. Mabel's daughter came, and laid its little waxen hands on its mother's breasts; but no great happiness and ease of heart came with its touch. The childish features were like her husband's-the same blue eyes, the same sunny hair, the same irresolute character of mouth-for, have I omitted the mention of it? there was a certain wavering expression constantly present on Eugene's lips;-but I do not know that AMabel ever looked into the father's eyes more tenderly, because they were like her own child's eyes; or that she ever caressed his waving hair, or kissed his wavering mouth, because she was accustomed to the reproduction of those features in the tiny face lying in her lap. Nor do I know that her mother's heart grew proud with the discoveries of constantly new similarities, as every day she noted them. It was strange, now that Mabel was a mother, that the bond-fastened with a link so precious-became no less galling than before; stranger still, that the mother   THE HEAIfRT OF MABEL WARE.      181      8 came at last to look upon the child as the embodi- ment and exponent of her lost freedom; stranger still, that now, admitting in her most secret soul such con- clusion, she began to revolt more desperately than be- fore; and, strangest of all, and horribly unnatural-- you will say, gentle reader--that not long after this, when this mother looked down into the sweet and in- nocent face of her child, with its blue eyes raised help- lessly, appealingly, and confidingly, she let drop into those baby eyes a look of deep aversion and disgust, so palpable and unsubdued that the child instinctively- screamed aloud with terror. Whenever, thereafter, Mabel looked into her daugh- ter's face, the same murderous impulse came and took momentary possession of her hands, her eyes, her as- pect. The child never failed to shrink from the terri- ble beauty of its mother's look. The mother hardly ever failed to restrain her hands with difficulty from doing dreadful infanticide. Nay, but this is horrible-this is not, and can not be   ? true? It is horrible, madam! but for its truthfulness --alas, 'tis an " ower true tale"I am telling you this day. Here it was. It seemed that this beautiful woman, heart-sore with her chafing struggles to be free again-    : felt herself defrauded of whatever life, and strength, and beauty, and soul, had gone out of herself, and mixed with other life to form this new being. 9     182  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. Suffering so deeply before, and bravely striving to be still, a fresh pang struck her, and she could but shriek. She felt, and could not away with the con- sciousness, that she had been robbed, cheated out of what must evermore seem a new concession and acqui- escence the most significant, to the sanctity of the alli- ance which she hated. An everlasting spirit of protest took possession of her heart. She could not reconcile it with herself. Sometimes she cried aloud: "I am robbed I Give it back to me! Its life is mine! Part of its soul is mine I! I have not consented! I will not consent I Give it back! Oh, I must, I will have it again; it shall not be so!" Then her eyes shone with bright fury. Her frame thrilled and trembled with passion. Her hands clutch- ed together involuntarily and relaxed in terror. The fearful consciousness that she was a murderess-the grisly, hateful thought of infanticide--smote her like a blow, and she fell sick and blind with remorse.

IN that portion of the journal-book which imme- diately follows the pleasant year's work-from which, in a former chapter, extracts were made ; a portion which extends up to a time, a little subsequent to the birth of Mabel's daughter-the entries are brief and crude. Al- most always they commence with an apologetic refer- ence to the length of time which has elapsed, since the last preceding entry; and the expression of the inten- tion not again so to neglect her duty. Early in these pages she speaks, whenever she writes, of the pressure of employments and diversions; speaks sadly of the loss of her old accustomed leisure and ease of life and heart. Here and there too, in these pages, the reader detects the subtle presence of an involuntary protest, forbidden all the while indeed-not allowed to stand up and make itself visible,; and yet, the very stoutness with which the writer avers that no such thing is, awakens     186   THE HEART   OF MABEL WARE. the reader's suspicion and points out the lurking hesi- tancy protested against. Later, for two or three months, there are no entries, and when on reaching home, that Spring after her marriage, she remembers again to take up her pen, she must needs be first at the old fashion of apologizing for the silence. It was the hurry of preparation, it was the wedding, and it was the bridal tour, and it was the gayety of the capital, and it was the weari- ness of one and all of these-poor lame excuses, made to satisfy the delinquent's conscience; which in truth, needed not to have been aroused at all, at so slight a sin as the neglect of a journal, but which, once awa- kened, should have had wherewithal to lull it more truly and completely than these poor opiates. Still later there are doubts and shrinkings from the destiny she foresees, all denied in letter, but present palpably enough in the spirit of what is written. In this part, however, as if here, by some natural turning away of the mind from the weariness of re- ality-a device of the heart, -for seeking relief-the reader finds here and there, a tale or a quaint rime, wholly from the affairs with which the writer has to do-yet even in these there is a sombre hue of thought, that confesses her prevailing sorrow. The ground of each, ballad or story, is sable, like this story of her life; but there is nevertheless a certain tinge of lurid beauty   THE HEART OF MABEL WA'RE.       187 wrought in each, which if it can not relieve the dark- ness, yet will not let away the glance that falls upon it, until the survey is complete. One of these is here transcribed. Come now, it seems that we build no more, our dear and beautiful Castles in Spain. Is the power then gone? Has the architect's cunning hand lost its craft? Has he forgotten the mystery, which he knew so well? Sooth, it appears not wherefore! but, nor do the fair castles appear any more! Come now, we are stupid! Let us have a tale. AND THE CAPTAIN COUNT OSRIC. Once there lived in a bleak clime a white-bearded king. His realm was wide enough, indeed, but a barren soil and a chilly sky made it seem poor. Many rugged mountains, however, crossed the kingdom, and among these were mines of salt, and great beds of iron ore. The state-revenues were therefore ample. More- over, his domain was almost entirely surrounded by the sea, and his coasts were populous with fishermen, who had been from time immemorial the most loyal subjects. The soil, also, unproductive in grains and fruits, bore     188  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. the hardy Northern pine in great forests, so that the white-bearded king had better and more abundant timber for ships tlian any king; beside. Almost all the soils of the fishermen, when they be- came young men, wishing to see more of the world than they were like to see in their narrow home, were willing to serve ten years in the king's navy. Accor- dingly the service had a constant supply of young sailors, who had been born on a wild coast and reared from infancy amid the toils and hardships of life on the waters. That portion of the realm which was not surrounded by waters, was defended by a chain of mountains, im- passable by any more formidable army than a lonely traveller or two with their servants and guide. The sea-ports iwere large and safe of harbor, and so fortified as to be unapproachable by any enemy, and the coast was too rough and wild to permit a fleet to discharge soldiers upon any part of it except at the ports. The white-bearded kilg, therefore, with his defences strong about him, with his mines of iron and of salt, with hs populous coasts, and loyal subjects, with his pine forests, and his never-failing supply of brave sailors for his navy, waxed proud of heart; but when- ever inl his moods of pride he looked upon his daughter, he grew unhappy, and in one of these, one day, he said to himself:--"Lo, I am a great king, among the kings   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       189 of the earth. I am the proudest of my line. I have wherewithal to defend myself against all adversaries; I am happy." But thinking a little longer, he brake out again. "Yet, I would I had gotten a son. I am old now, and however great and powerful, I must die. I would I had gotten a son, who should be like me. A son, who should bear my name and wear my crown when I shall have laid both aside." And, thinking still a little longer, musing quietly and speaking softly, he said; "Emilie is a good child, and a 'brave girl too, as I know right well. But how shall a girl wield the scep- tre of a king? My great crown would crush her smooth brow, and my name-alas, I fear my name would go over the world with a trifling echo if this child should bear it after me." Then the old king fell into a fit of musing again, and, as it was after dinner, presently he fell asleep, where--with his chamberlain tip-toeing here and there, fanning away the- flies, the audacious democrats--we will leave him to enjoy his siesta. Among the royal ships was one strong and staunch, and swift and beautiful, which led the navies into every battle, reached first any distant port, and never failed to bring her convoys safely home through the greatest array of hostile forces. Her mast bore in every fleet she joined the admiral's broad pennant; 9*     190   THE HEART   OF MABEL WARE. her officers were the most skilful, her sailors were the bravest of the navy. To belong to her was, in that kingdom, as proud as it was in Rome to belong to the tenth legion. A fisherman once perilled his life, and lost it, to save the crew of a royal vessel which was wrecked on his coast. His orphan son, a helpless lad, ten years old, was sent by the king as a sailor-boy on the famous royal ship. In three or four years, in a place where all were sig- nally brave, he signalized himself, in a great fight, by his wonderful courage and skill. He was made an officer. In three or four years later, after another great battle, the young officer was ennobled, and invited to visit the Court. Lieutenant Count Osric was presented to the king. Every one praised and admired him. Osric saw the princess Emilie. He loved her. His passion consumed him. One day in a balcony, where were many ladies and noblemen of the Court, drawing her apart, he declared his love. She trembled and blushed. She turned to leave him, but did not go. They were about to be interrupted. She extended her swl ite hand. He pressed it to his lips, and they sepa- rated. Thle nex-t day, the princess looking from a casement into a park, saw a painter taking. upon an ivory plate, her portrait, by stealth. Astonished and indignant,   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       191 she withdrew. But when she saw Count Osric near him, and noted his imploring gesture, she came back and stood in a bashful attitude, but with a kindly look upon her face, until the artist had finished his task. Osric waved her adieu. The next day he went with his ship away. The princess heard of his bravery always. She knew that he loved her. She loved him too, and whenever the ship came to the port, she used to send a page to scull by the vessel in a little boat, and bring her word if he had -seen the brave Lieutenant, and how he bore himself. Once also, she arrayed herself in the page's dress, and going with him, saw Osric, and had nearly fainted when her lover, by accident, looked that way. But without a special summons, the officer could not approach the palace. And this was the way all things were-when the white-bearded king woke up from his nap. The king had dreamed his daughter married to the son of a great king, whose realm adjoined his own be- yond the mountains, and who had been evermore a rival. And, while the fit was on him, he sent a mis- sive to his brother-king, saying, "Make with me now this treaty of alliance, and send hither thy son. By my faith, I will give him my daughter to wife." I And this very Osric bore in his ship the'messenger to the other king, not knowing what he did. The herald who came, said, "See, now, I have here     192  THE HEART .OF MABEL AWARE. drawn and signed the treaty of alliance; sign thou, and look for my stripling, who will set forth on the mor- row." Then the white-bearded king bade his servants make a great feast against the morrow. And he called his daughter, and said to her: "Be jocund, dearest, to- morrow is a feast, and thou shalt be its mistress. And be blithe of heart, I say, my darling puss, for to-mor- row night I will give thee a brave dower, and wed thee to a noble lord." Emilie wept and prayed, but the king stormed till he foalned in the mouth; for although he loved his daughter, yet was lhe truculent and high of mood. The poor lady protested, but the king stamped his foot and swore. So the smooth-faced boy tlhat came the morrow's eve, took her troth, and presently they crowned all the ringing festivities with the marriage. A little afterward, Osric came with the brave ship into port. Again, there had been a battle. The cap. tain of the ship had been killed, and no one was found to fill his place like Lieutenant Osric. He was made captain, and again bidden to Court. But before the Captain Count went up to the palace, he found means to convey thither, to Emilie, the ivory plate, 'and across the face he had written, "My lady, thou art false!"   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.        193 At this all Emilie's poorly stifled love rose again. With her tears she erased the cruel words, not caring if, at the same time, she soiled the beauty of the pic- ture, and returned it faded and little worth, with the words written under the soiled portrait, "My lord, I am true." Then coming to the palace, Count Osric saw her, pale and sad of brow and eyes. The other courtiers said it was child-birth that made her pale-for Emilie had borne a son now; but Osric knew that it was love and sorrow.                         - So, his passion consumed him again until he was mad. And presently getting speech of her, he said, "Lady, hast ever a trusty page in thy train?" The lady, thinking of that one who so often had gone to look after this very lover, smiled, and an- swered, "One who will die when I bid him!" "Then," bralke forth Osric, "'disguise thyself as his brother. Go forth at night from the palace's northern gate. Traverse the city's great street until the city is behind thee, and a forest is at thy left hand. Enter a path which will appear, and follow it until thy dear feet press a cliff above the sea." "And thou?" questioned Emilie. "I," said the Count, " will anchor my ship against the cliff. A red light shall float at the mast-head. I will come with a boat and bear thee away. Then,     194   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. with the strong ship we will go to another land-a summer-land, where we shall be forever happy. Oh, fly with me, lady, or I die I Fly with me, I pray thee by our love. I bid thee from all pains. I proffer thee all delights!" "But, my lord," asked the lady, looking lovingly, yet doubtingly, into his eyes, "must I do this?" "Dear Emilie, I implore thee!" "Nay, my lord, rather command, and so I shall have strength to obey. Without thy command I can not do it." Then coming closer to him, and laying her hand in his, she said: "But, for the command, dear Osric, I entreat thee." Then he said, "Come, then; I command thee," and she promised. The night came, and was bleak and dark. It had rained all day. The ground was wet and cold, and all shrubs were heavy with rain drops which lurked in the hollows of the blossoms and the leaves. And the night was bleak and dark; and a cold wind kept blow- ing stronger and stronger from the sea. But Emilie, arrayed like a page, set forth, with her trusty follower. For she knew that her lover would not fail. She left her sleeping lord. She left her sleeping child. They left the palace-gate. They traversed the crowded streets. Houses dark and houses light, houses to the right and houses to the left, lamps and bridges   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       195 and sentries, and whirling carriages and night-walkers they left behind them. Emilie trembled but did not faint. A wood was at their left. A path opened and re- ceived them. It led them over knolls and down ra- vines. It led them through open places where fairies might tread a ring, and through thickets where mur- derers might lurk in lair. It led them to a cliff, and they paused. Below them swas blackness of darkness, but the roar of the sea came up and assailed their ears. Emilie could see no red light, and her heart beat loud. Captain Osric, weighing anchor at nightfall, and sail- ing down to that part whence he had promised to sig- nal the cliff, spoke not a word to his officers, but left them to conjecture, "it is a secret expedition." He' walked the deck and said, "Make this sail!" and, to the helmsman, " a-port," or " a-lee." But this place, where he had promised to anchor his ship, was a part hardly ever navigated. No port was near. There were shoals and breakers where the sea ran high. There was no light-house in sight. Yet Os- ric knew the place, and at another time his pilotage wpuld have been safe. As for his men, they had all such sublime confidence in their officer's knowledge and skill, that if he had proposed to pilot them down the Maelstrom, and back again by some unheard of channel, they would, each and all, have said, "Good, then, we shall arrive!"     196  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. At another time Osric's pilotage would have been successful; but now the sea was high, and the wind blew strong, and the night was dark. They were on the breakers. A red light-many a red light-went to the mast-head, and tarried all along the shrouds, to signal, with their lurid gleam, distress; and the great guns boomed out their horror at the peril. But before Emilie came to the cliff above, the ship was broken, the lights were quenched, and the men were dead. Morning came, and still the princess stood on the lofty cliff. She saw spars and pieces of the wreck in the sea below. She climbed, by a winding path, down the cliff-side to the beach. She saw Osric lying dead. She saw the men dead around her-in each eye a re- proach, and each clammy mouth seeming to say, "It is thou!" The lady went to a convent, where, as some say, she died young; but others say-and I guess these last are right--that she lived old, became a saint, and could do miracles. But young or old, I warrant me, she never left off to say masses for the soul of Osric, and the souls of the brave men, that lay stark and dead on the sand that day; nor ever ceased to see in her dreams the re- proachful look of their dead eyes, and to hear in all winds and storms, their voices saying still forevermore, "It was thou."   THE HEART oF    MABEL WARE.    197 And that is the tale of the Princess Emilie, and her lover, the Captain Count Osric. But now, if I should say that the lady's deceived lord took their child, and went back to his father's realm, where the two made war upon the white-bearded one, and-all that I might say about the fortunes of the kingdom-ah, how dreamy, and alien, and far away would it not all seem? And this because the tale of the lovers is complete. Loves are immortal. Tales of these, and of these alone, are ever new. If, now, one should tell a simple story of love, and another pom- pous tale of war, of the times of Aurelian perhaps, the first would seem nearer to us, I give you my word, by fifteen centuries or so, than the last.       How ye memories come and goe, In our heartes of long ago; How the echoes sink and swell, Through ye vales where echoes dwell, Strangeliest wakened, strangeliest hushed; Nowe, by lightest zephyrs brushed, Springing up, and ringing out Cleare and loude as a child's shout; Falling nowe, and dying, dead, By oblivion overspread. Long the heart in some nook-part, May holde love a-lurking, latent; But at last-and the beats beat fast- A worde, a touch, a tone--'tis patent.     S   PART THRD. XIV. 31t lDt    c ftJe THE succeeding year rolled heavily away. The suc- ceeding and changing seasons brought to Mabel no change or relief, brought to Eugene no thought of sus- picion nor unrest of heart, and brought to the little Floy, health indeed and baby-beauty, but won not for her a mother's love. Their way of life in the old family mansion-for since their marriage Eugene and Mabel had lived with her father until at his death the place became their homestead-was quiet and secluded. Outside her own family, including Mrs. Barbeyrac, Mabel had no neigh- boring intimacies. In managing the double estate, Eugene's time was fully occupied; and although he was     202  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. . nearly always at home, yet his employments left them little time for other than incidental and common-place conversation. Mabel, accustomed from childhood to witness the stateliness of Martha Ruggles, and regarding her as ex- clusive mistress of the house, by some subtle and in- fallible prerogative, had little inclination to swerve from her blind loyalty. She knew little of the affairs of the household. The internal economy of Martha's realm was but dimly comprehended, and lightly cared for by the nominal mistress. The industrial policy of the domestic state, was left uninvaded in the hands of its executive. Mabel, weary of her place, weary of its environments, weary of herself, turned faintly away from the world and buried her in the hurtful seclusion of books and meditation. I say hurtful seclusion. Hermitage is not a natural condition of being. There are few souls utterly free from those lurking dispositions toward evil, upon which seclusion begets a monstrous brood of doubts, suspicions, misanthropies, repinings, and questionings of such grave matters as should forevermore be left un- questioned. There are few minds so pure of metal, so flawless and serene of temper, that all the biting corro- sions of empty hearts, vagrant thoughts and unfilled years, come upon them, and, passing away again, leave them uneaten, bright and true. Monkery of the heart,   THE  HEART   OF MABEL   WARE.   203- and cloisterage of the mind are among the severest tests wherewithal mind and heart can be tried. Few men have the courage to endure them. Fewer still come forth from their endurance whole. Life for the young I Admiration and contrasts for the beautiful I Emulous strivings, successes, and de- feats for the high of heart I Busy toils and high suffer- ings for the hopeful! The terrible aggregates of life's small griefs, petty vexations, and fretting cares for the brave! The swirling tide of recklessness, the over- whelming billows of worldly indifference for the proud. For the haughty of soul, that wretched conformity whereto custom's great inexorable wheel breaks its vic- tims! For the children, of genius, cold, unappreciative, flouting sneers; or, worse, unappreciative but fulsome flattery I For one, here and there through the world and through the years, for one or two of inward in- tegrity of soul, of calm serenity of mind, full of the world's gathered wisdom, loneliness perhaps, reflection, speculation, converse with God and with nature, self- commerce! But for the rest, life; while we live, life! Life with its sweeping tumults, its clangors, its music, its swift strokes; its grievous burdens, its grieving cheats, its wickedness, its folly, its laughter, its tears, its gentle hu- manities; oh life! dear life, that is so short; sweet life, to be lost forever; sounding life, one day to be     204   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. still; proud life, that will one day grovel down to such humility; joyous life, that will grow so sad I Sweet doings, that shall quickly be done; sweet beings, that are and then are not; sweet regards, now drinking in all beauties, to-morrow to be glazed!

Sweet desires, that will no more clamorI Lusts, that will no more quicken I Beauty, that will be unsightly! Warmth, that will be most clammy cold! Life, that will be Death!- "But let me live my life!" One day in the second summer after Floy's birth, Mabel, reading in a city newspaper, carelessly down a column, which seemed all the way down, to have as little interest for her as a column in a moon's news- paper might have, came suddenly, upon a name that smote her eyes like a blow. So startled was she, that she lost the place; and when she saw it again, again it drove the blood to her heart, leaving her pale and cold, then brought it in a tumult back through all her veins. It was in the summer. Oppressive heats were about them. They had fled the heavy house and sought the shade of that piazza fi'onting from the sun. Eugene was playing with Floy, while Mabel sat at a little dis-   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.-      205 tance from the others, so turned from them that she was unobserved. The name she had found? What other name could it be, only his who had come there, years before, to fill her childish heart for one hour with wonder and-de- light, and who, as suddenly as he came, had gone down-so the dream ran, she thought-to lie in long disquietude beneath the heavy waters, leaving but a, glimmering memory to be wept for and shuddered at? But it was a dream only I This paragraph which had so startled Mabel was a notice of his recent arrival in the country, and a reference to his wonderful escape from a shipwreck which involved the destruction of all beside, on board the ill-fated vessel. So-it was in good truth but a dream of terror after all. This was the first time the rumor of his loss had ever been doubted-yet it must be true! --For he was even now returned. Oh, it came suddenly upon the heart of Mabel. Away, into forgetfulness fled the few years-they had not seemed a few-she had lived, since he had been with her, that bright morning, among the flowers at the summer-house. Away, like darkness before the  sun-rise, went the mists which now always overhung her path of life, and there, in the kind and kindling sunlight, the bland -and balmy sunlight, she sat like a child listening to hidden music, while in her- heart a 10     206  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. new song was ringing. Again, still sitting quietly in her place, she wandered the garden, free and light of heart as of foot, stirring this root, pruning that plant, listening now to the birds, and now stopping to feel the embracing glow of the morning light and air, and thinking the while of the strange gentlemen who were in the house. Again, she sees one of them, the young- est, and so unlike the rest-come down the garden- walk toward the summer-house where she stands; and her eyes, as she thinks, fill with tears to remember how kindly of tone he asked--"Are you our good host's daughter, little maiden?"She remembers now, all the while weeping quietly and without pain-how gravely and sweetly he looked upon her, when she prattled to him that her mother was dead, and that her father was mad, but that her dear uncle Reginald was her guardian; and how tenderly, after he had told her that his mother too was dead, and his father and his sister as well, he drew her to his side, and took off her gipsey hat, to let her hair fall down and blow out more freely on the breeze--and then, how he asked her questions--she wonders yet how he knew to ask such questions. The revery was not long, but it seemed like a sleep fall of pleasant dreams. When she came back with a sigh, she felt cool as if a breath from the cool North, had come down through the heats for her refreshment.   THE- HEART OF MABEL WARRE. ' 207 Now while she looked up at the trees, the landscape beauties, and the blue heavens, her heart was pervaded with a quiet joy for long years unfelt before. Carefully avoiding her husband and the domestics, she made her way through the garden to the summer- house, and stooped to pull away the weeds from the roots of the climber, which years before had received the name of "Philip's Clernatis." She carefully cleared the place, and with her delicate fingers mellowed the earth around. She brought water with her own hands and gave it to drink. She disentangled it from its va- grant clamberings, and trained it tall and beautiful, up the lintel and over the arched door of the bower. For this flower, trained once by their mutual hands, had about it a certain fragrant sweetness, which was more ethereal than even a flower's odor-a sweetness which her heart recognised without analyzing, a quality which, with instinctive providence, she took and inhaled, but let go unnamed. Then, standing under it, she reached up and plucked the brightest blossom, placed it in her hair, and, stand- ing there still, overarched by the vine, lost herself and wandered away again up and down the vistas of sweet- est revery. Yet wherever her fancy wandered, she did not at all leave out the memory of the stranger who went away and seemed dead; but who was not dead, as it now seemed--and her heart beat quicker at this-- btut who had returned again alive.     208  THE HEART OF MABEL. WARE. She wondered most of all if he had remembered his visit to the Wold; if ever he had recalled the little gipsey-hatted girl he had unbonnetted so freely, and, for that matter, unsouled too, quite as freely. She could not think it possible that he had not quite lost her away out of his memory long ago, and the thought marred the beauty of the revery, as an unresting night- mare mars the beauty of a dream. Mabel did not admit to herself the change wrought by this sudden knowledge that Philip Sutherland was living. She would have been shocked to comprehend and believe fully, that a rumor concerning the life of a stranger, or at the most of an acquaintance, had been able so to move her. She did not consider that this belief, which took possession of her, that Philip was not dead, had begun to fill a void which Eugene and her child had never been able to fill; and that the strang- er's imagined presence in these reveries was potent to lay the spirit of unrest, which no struggles of duty and wifely submission had ever been able to exorcise. Sometimes, indeed, a quick thought flashed upon her of the truth, but she banished it with womanly pride, and denied to her heart the conviction that this stranger was more to her than another. Yet she did not the less, for this sturdy denial, find him in all her thoughts. It was said, if the reader will remember, that Philip had only met Mabel once-a morning meeting in a   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       209 flower-garden-and then had gone away that afternoon. -He had, however, during his stay at the Wold, drawn to himself very powerfully, the observation and sym- pathies of Reginald. In the few days thus passed to  gether; these two had formed a warm friendship. The man of the world, satiated with pleasures and heart-sore with affliction, and the young man-knowing the world too, and having tasted every cup which had palled the other's taste,-looked upon all about them, life and its shows, its shadows and its substances, through the same calmly scrutinizing eyes; but Philip looked upon all out of a heart fresh and young. His regard, therefore, wandered sweetly round the world. Accustomed to intercourse with oldermen, and with men who had seen life, Philip had early learned to hold his heart in check; to proffer, in worldly commerce, only the coin of his brain, which is bright enough for that generally, and which is every where current- though the metal is baser than that of another coinage. Living among men who laugh only to sneer, he had found it necessary to sneer as well; among men who had completed their task of wondering, and had there- fore never more to wonder or admire, he could stint in all admiration, or trick it in the livery of critical scru. tiny. But when he found that Reginald was not the same hard man that the others were-that there were springs     210  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. of fervor in his heart yet unexhausted, and that natural feeling unrestrained, called from him responsive feeling instead of mockery, then the two found a bond of sym- pathy between them. There was in each a combination of worldliness and of freshness--each so tempering the other, that they presently felt a mutual attraction, and yielded to it without stint. Accordingly, preserving before others the calm mien of courtly decorum which prevailed, when they were alone together, they lost this in a kind of sweet abandon of joyous cheerfulness, and felt like children in the unaccustomed freedom. When Philip went away, therefore, Reginald's heart went after him ; and at the rumor of his early death, Mabel saw her guardian weeping as for a young brother dead. Often after this, the two spoke of the young stranger. From her guardian Mabel learned the story of his life; and up to the time when Reginald too went from the Wold, they did not cease sometimes to dis- course of him, and to cherish his memory. Mabel, therefore, felt to know him better than one with whom she had only met once.  And though, whenever her thoughts recurred to him, her memory went straight to the morning and the garden, yet it vaguely seemed that there were many other meetings between them, only a little less distinct than this one, which she might dwell upon, if she would. Since her marriage, however, these souvenirs of the   THE HEART OF MABEL WAKRE.       2" stranger-dead as it always seemed-had grown less frequent and more shadowy. Before the day when the newspaper column showed her his name so unexpect- edly, AMabel had almost entirely forgotten to think of Philip Sutherland. Yet when the rumor of his death was thus denied, and the assurance came that he was alive and near again, all that had ever been in her heart concerning him, .came back so vividly that she saw at once that nothing of all had been lost. Fate is said to be blind. But if he might have seen into Mabel's heart, and noted how all her thoughts were filled with another's name than her husband's, he would have been ready to lay by his schoolmaster's trade forevermore, in disgust at having been so out- witted, and cheated into the belief of his pupil's progress. And perhaps this would have been his wisest course, for I apprehend, she would not now have labored at his tasks so patiently as before.     I       i   How the chafed and burdened soul, Startes and bounds beyond control, Toe gladde voices of the past.

Every day she trained it taller, -mellowed the earth about its roots, and watered it at high noon. She tore away the intruding branches of other shrubs, and taught its tendrils to assume new shapes of beauty; and every day plucking a single flower and wreathing it in her hair, she forgot to look at the book she. had brought out with her--forgot/ every thing, in other reveries like that of the first day. In these happy day-dreams she did not permit the intrusion of such unlovely guests as the thought of her present relations and the remembrance of her present abjectness would have been. She loved wholly to cast these out of view, and to go back to the days when yet she was a child, when her guardian was with her, when all her days were days of pleasure, when her thoughts were high and heroic, when the great world was still -     216  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. beyond, unexplored, and the bearded men who came down to mingle a week with the simple and unwonder- ful denizens of the place, used to make her strange to herself. About this time Eugene went to spend a fortnight in the city. Mrs. Barbeyrac, whose health had been very much broken since Eugene's marriage, but who still stoutly insisted on keeping up her own establishment, down on the other bank of the river, now came to spend the few days of his absence with Mabel. Hitherto, since their marriage, they had lived very much at home, and almost quite alone. Eugene had hardly before been absent longer than a single day. And now, while Mrs. Barbeyrac would wile the sum- mer mornings away with little Floy, leaving Mabel to wander alone and to sit in the summer-house unob- served, it seemed like the lost freedom of girlhood restored for a happy hour; and her heart exulted al- most as if she had never known sorrow or perplexity. Every day she rose with the sunrise. She gar- dened, she rode alone, she played on her harp-it was an accomplishment learned since her marriage-she went abroad as if she were a girl, and left Martha Ruggles as unobstructed and free in her domain as she had been while Mabel was indeed a child. In fact, this unnatural joyousness of mood, apparent as it could but be, and seeming like a gleam of sudden sunshine   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.        217 through the clouds of gloom  by which her path seemed always overhung, aroused the watchfulness of this worthy creature; and Mabel presently afterwards began to be aware that all her movements were noted, and her temper scanned by a pair of bleared but peering eyes, which seemed to possess the extraordi- nary advantage of an excellent view of every haunt to which she could resort. A suspicion came upon her of the truth, that Martha, not failing to observe her recent change of disposition, could find no rest for her imagination, nor repose for her curiosity until she should be able, by crafty espial or by malicious con- jecture, to discover the cause. Mabel was, therefore, conscious that her movements, and even her emotions, must be to some degree re- strained. But she was cautionede soon after this, in another manner than by the painful evidence of her own consciousness. Itt is possible, that, in our interest in the more im- portant characters of this work, the character and movements of this good Martha Ruggles have been allowed to repose in unworthy obscurity. It is hoped that her importance has not been undervalued. Let us hasten to do Martha Ruggles a morsel of justice. Ever since her accession, Martha had ruled her realm with a rod of iron, which was only not grievous on account of the unwavering submission and loyalty     218  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. of her subjects. Nothing in her reign had ever pleased her; consequentlv she was as s happy as could have been expected. Her feelings had sustained a succession of outrages, which, by means of the agreeable excitement they afforded her, had rendered her comparatively a comfortable woman. The madness of James Ware, the return- of his brother, his own recovery, the de- parture of Reginald, MaIbel's winter in town, the mar- riage, the birth of the childl--anticipated and realized- and finally her master's death, were each and all events which had, in her belief, no other significance--no farther scope-than of deep personal injuries to herself. Most of her time was given up to labor; much of it however, was reserved for tears. Martha Ruggles had hardly any difficulty in con- jecturing, that, as Mabel was happy in Eugene's ab- sence, it must be because Eugene's presence was irk- some to her. Once conjectured, and suddenly it grew as broad as the noon; and now too, directly, she re- membered that she had known it for a long time; and considering on this point a little, she was ready to ad- mit that she had suspected as much, from the very day when first she " clapped eyes to the young couple when they came back from Washington." And the worthy creature wept to confess how the knowledge had lain like a heavy burden on her heart. But if Martha had been able by a miracle of discreet *0   THE   HEART  OF MABEL WARE.    219 and self-imposed restraint, hitherto, for so long a time, to preserve this secret intact within the recesses of her virgin heart, she certainly found now some great and insuperable difficulty in allowing it' to remain in its goodly retreat any longer. For a day or itwo,-indeed, she did no more with it, than to bestow upon Mrs Bar- beyrac, a variety of hints, so darkly worded as to be wholly harmless, and in fact, utterly meaningless. But, when she saw that hints fell upon the proud, but fond, old woman, like seed upon rocks, she fretted herself into a dissolving passion; and, quite overcome by her emotions, revealed the whole--which, indeed, was nothing but' merest gossamer suspicion-.asseverating vehemently the while, that nothing but affection for Eugene, and her sense of duty to her master, impelled her to the disclosure, and forbade her to suffer the truth to lie any longer unrevealed. Great was Mrs. Barbeyrac's astonishment, and obsti- nate her incredulity. Mabel, her dear child, hers al- ways from the cradle, so it seemed, until now, hers and Eugene's; Mabel false? Mabel, playing a treacherous part with her husband, and with all? Out upon it, for a base libel! Out upon you, too, Martha Ruggles, for a credulous fool! Out upon me, too, for an unworthy friend, if I let the slander shake my loving confidence I It and you, Martha Ruggles, are false and -frivolous. Whimper me no whimpers for the sharp word or two     220  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. of mine; but weep, if you must weep at all, for shame, at having slandered the sweetest and most loving lady your foolish eyes ever beheld. In some such fashion, went up before Mabel the shield of the good old lady's love. The shafts of suspicion fell down along the bright surface of the breast-plate, leaving not a scratch. The doughty Martha was discomfited.  She retired from the field in a veil of tearful mist, heaving many a deprecatory sob from the depths of her virgin breast. So was vanquished this good Ruggles. Not so were dismissed the malicious little fiends of mistrust and doubt, conjured by her bathetic eloquence. Mrs. Bar- beyrac, left mistress of the absurd field, dismissing her heat by degrees, fell unconsciously but curiously to scanning the matter. Picking up at leisure the enemy's spent shafts, she began to consider whether or no their barbed points were poisoned with malice; whether or no, if such poison were detected, innocence could be hurt by the infection. With mere womanly curiosity, she began to wield herself the very weapons which her own love had foiled, when wielded by the strange hand. Recalling, again and again, Martha's ingenious and imaginative arrayals of the various grounds for doubt, she began presently to admit a doubt to her own mind, that all was not right. Then she too, quietly, but with- out any relaxation, began to watch. Presently Eugene returned. Mabel was not in the   TH E HEART OF MABEL WARE.      221 house when he arrived, but his grandmother received him, and with that frankness which had never allowed her to have a thought for her grandson, and leave it unshared by him, told him all that Martha had said. Here, however, the natural kindness of the old lady prompted her to give the tale a color less start- ling, than that which had adorned the sketch of the poetical housekeeper. To Eugene the whole was as light as any breeze. He had no room in his happy heart for doubt. And while he requested Mrs. Barbeyrac strongly to repri- mand Martha Ruggles, he could only, at the most, be induced to promise that he would observe, how warmly or how indifferently Mabel might meet him when she should come. As Mabel rode up the lawn, Eugene came forth to assist her in dismounting. He shouted his greeting loud and gayly. He told her that while he was in town, he had met a stranger, one Sutherland, who had inquired for the "little flower of the Wold;" and that the gentleman had been induced, for old friendship's sake, to accept Eugene's hospitable invitation, and was coming down in a week, to spend some time with the family. All this intelligence Eugene had imparted before Mabel had dismounted; and then, when mindful of his promise, he turned to observe her manner, he was at     222  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. once shamed that he lad been led to promise at all. How her cheek flushed to see him! How her eyes grew eloquent and bright-to have him at home again. How tenderly she questioned him of the incidents of his absence, and even inquired concerning Sutherland- where he had met hinm, how he looked, and all-telling the while, how they had heard, just after he had left the Aold, of his loss at sea, and that only a few days ago she had seen the announcement that he was alive. Eugene reproached himself for a disloyal traitor; and that night, in his happiness, while they were sitting on the piazza, he confessed the whole to Mabel, and laugh- incgly protested himself quite satisfied. But oh, it was well that the deep dusk hid the sud- den paleness of the lady's cheek, or else, the whole tale had there been told. Mrs. Barbeyrac instantly began to explain her share in the matter, with a view to exculpate herself from the appearance of an unworthy suspicion; but as the old lady was strictly truthful, and not accustomed to apologize, every word she said only served to make the matter worse. And Maabel still grew pale. Then Eu- gene, noticing that she was silent, and guessing that she was grieved, perhaps indignant, began warmly to de- fend her. The old lady, somewhat perplexed by her awkward attempt at an apology, warmly replied; and the two fell, for the first time in their'lives, into a dis-   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       223 pute, from which Mabel at once retired, and which was continued and increased in earnestness until it assumed the form of a quarrel. The next morning Mrs. Bar- beyrac went to her home, unhappy and discontented. From that time there was a feeling of restraint between her and her children.     r   Faces that goe from us pale, Come agen in other yeares, Beaten browne wi' many a gale, Furrowed wi' lines that speak a tale, Of toils, and mayhap of teares.

HE had remembered her then. It Awas more than she had allowed to her daring dreams. He had spoken of her, and as she would have had him speak, if she might have chosen-as " the little flower of the Wold." He had then worn her memory like a flower in his- bosom, across the great seas and through the great perils; and returning now after so long, had not failed to wear it back again. Who could tell how many times, in the changes of his adventurous life, he had called up this souvenir along with other happy thoughts, perhaps oftener than any other-and solaced himself with the gentle fragrance of the memory. Who knows but perhaps be might in the very hour of extremest danger, have thought of the little maiden at the Wold, who had told him all her heart; and perhaps, even then-who could know?--might have shrank back from death more carefully, for that he remembered that she might weep to hear.     228  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. And he was coming; he would be there in a week. She sat her down to wait; but oh, surely it must have been more than a week-it must have been months before he came. Yet he did not fail to come with his time.          I    mat Philip Sutherland came. In all material points he was the same. A casual observer might have pro- nounced him unchanged. Hlis eyes were slightly more steady in their glance. His face had a pale and more thoughtful cast. His beard was a shade darker His voice might have fallen to a deeper tone, but it was more earnest and retained all its old penetrating quali ty still uttering an eloquence which Mabel could well believe irresistible. He seemed sad. His glance, in the power of which he used to exult, was quiet now and almost unused; and if, at sudden times it was seen still capable of taking men's thoughts against their ill, yet there was now a prevailing cast of kindliness, which gave assurance that, without pressing motive, the power would not be exercised to dismay, to sur- prise, or to fascinateroad, an Recently he had met Reginald Ware abroad, an had welcome intelligence, of his pursuits, his health, and pleasures. Muchll that Mabel wished most to know oncd plerg hre guardian, philip could tell; and accor- dingly in the pleasant conversations which resulted, Mabel was brought much into contact with Sutherland. I-abe ws ro=yt   .c   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       229 He had strange tales to tell also, of startling note, concerning his own adventures and perils. Wild tales, which he had no taste for telling for the admiration of vulgar ears; stories which, with native dignity and delicacy, he abstained from alluding to at all, until Mabel found means to draw from him, "With prayer of earnest heart That he would all his pilgrimage dilate, Whereof by parcels she had something heard." Therefore, taking a favoring occasion, when they were alone, he told his tale-how, leaving the Wold, that summer's day that she did wot of, and leaving the land- a little later, he went down upon the great deep in the strong ship, with "the many men so beautiful," so happy and so brave. How they looked behind them with pensive eyes to bid farewell to the sinking shores; the others because they were leaving friends and home-he, because he had seen that gipsey-bonneted maiden at the Wold-and here he paused and looked at the listener, and Mabel looked down and blushed, and both put by the thought With an effort, and Philip resumed the tale. They had lost the shores from sight, and now their pensive eyes grew glad as they turned them outward surveying only the waters and the sky. Then the round sun came in the morning up out of rosy waves,     280  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE, and shone all day upon white-crested billows, and set at last in molten glass. The moon and stars went softly overhead at night, making no noise; and some- times compelling winds came after them, and lent white wings to the speed of the flapping wheels, nor ever were they perplexed or beaten by ruder gales. But once sudden gusts ran over the shivering sea. Great tempests flung out banners above them, and storm-legions bivouacked about their path. The climb- ing seas roared loud, and swelled high, and beat down their flimsy bulwarks and guards. The water flooded and quenched their fires. The masts went, torn from the rended ropes and shrouds. They were at the mercy of the merciless elements, a drifting wreck. Then he told, while Mabel shuddered at his calm voice, so contrasting with the terror of the tale-how the ship gave a great lurch and settled perceptibly, how the mariners looked each to the others, with the blood all flooding back to their hearts, leaving their brown faces pallid; then how, presently, she gave another lurch and settled deeper, so that the landsmen too, knew their immediate danger, and grew pale as well. And how, with another and another lurch, swaying now to this side and now to that, her stern rose high in air, and her bows went down in a whirl- pool. And then, with low voice and sad mien, he told how, amidst the sudden graspings of every hand, the   THE  HBEART OF MABEL WARE.     281 troubled looks of every eye, the pallor of all cheeks, and the faintness of all hearts, the strong men, and the beautiful women, and the little hildren went together out of the sweet air and light of heaven, down below the seething surface, and down, oh, to what oppressive depths of cruel waves! and how, the few, strong of limb and brave of heart, who, suffocating all the while for breath, clomb the great height of the swaying walls, and came forth at last, only not dead saw the others never more. Then, these few who had come forth again from the jaws of death, saying nothing to each other, swam wearily here and there, until one after another had found a spar or plank or oar to cling to; then helpless, disheartened, they went, slowly drifting--slowly drift ing--on the swelling, and the sinking-on the mount- ing, and the falling of the billows-of the billows,- swelling, sinking--mounting, falling-on the billows, slowly drifting on the sea--on the wide, wide sea. Some went down again, and the others were parted, and saw each other no more; but through the night that followed, long despairing cries went at intervals over the waters, and each that heard, knew that another of the weary floaters was at rest. When morning came, one was alone. No others, nor spar, nor floating wreck, nor succoring bark, nor white sail, could be seen in all the distances.     232  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. All day the fierce sun beat down upon his aching head. Water there was, and his tongue was parched, but he could not drink. Weary he was, and the bil- lows were softer than couches of down, but he could not repose. The night came, and he bade farewell to the sun with his weary eyes, and said, "In the morning, I shall be thrice dead." But a white sea-bird fluttered cheeringly before his eyes, and a white thought fluttered cheeringly in his heart. And that thought? -- "Was of me!" said Mabel, suddenly dropping her eyes at his inquiring glance; and the speaker grew silent. It was afterwards that Mabel heard of the ship which came to rescue him, of the port in lower France, to which he was borne, of his long illness there, and kindest nursing,-and of many other adventures, that had befallen him since.   Toe his kenne is nothing hidde, Who can note the playe unbid, O'er the features of small smiles, And sadde wearie lookes-the wiles Of ye hearte, to hide its tale; From his eye can naught availe.

No man so accomplished in knowing the motives, the character, and the thoughts of those around him, could be deceived by the feeble attempt, which, in obe- dience to the promptings of conscience, Mabel was ac- customed to make, to impose upon the world a sem- blance of love for her husband. There are many avenues to the heart, left unguarded even when it is most strictly given in charge to the sen- tries to watch and ward. No heart, not already com- pletely occupied and garrisoned, can be fortified strongly enough to shut out storming besiegers, and to shut in the treacherous lurking messengers, who undo bolts and bars, and let in foes o'nights. No man who is skilled, with a sudden, hinting word to startle his listener out of an artificial, into a natural mood, and who knows how to study those moods of nature, is at a loss to go to the bottom of the secrets which lie in a woman's soul.      236  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. Philip Suth6rland was not deceived. He probed and estinmated the quality and volume of Eugene's character in an hour. He questioned, as his habit was -how could such a man con-llmand the admiration, and satisfy the requirements of such a woman?  How could a man so tamely gifted, meet and respond to the divers tempers of a woman, at once imperious and gentle, intellectual and sensuous, severe and voluptu- ous? HLow could a man so little kingly, sway and control a woman so variable of impulse, so rebellious of emotions? How had Mabel been led into this mockery of ties, which she wore so uneasily?-for he could read, too, the ill-concealed aversion. How, with her high, her severe estimate of the sanctity of the affections, had she been led so utterly to disregard their promptings; and, how would it end?  Here was a study, then. Sutherland sat him down to ex- amine, with curious eye, the game before him. But it was not merely the curiosity of a connoisseur, that prompted, and constantly made him eager for the study. When Sutherland, on his first visit to Wahlen Wold, had turned away from the summer-house, in the balmy morning, and left behind him the young girl, so beauti- ful, so free of heart, so candid and responsive of soul, he had said within himself: "If now this child, had five years more to her age, my choice were already made.   THE   HEART OF MABEL WARE.     237 I would win her love." Then, sighing to feel that it was only a dream which he could not make real, he sought consolation in saying, and once and again re- peating: ";Well, well, doubtless, if she were -a woman she would have become common, and then she would have lost the charm." But, each time he repeated the common-place, he felt a certain protest in his heart fined purpose, but with a vagrant and sweet intent, some year to return and test the truth. Going thence, and leaving the country but a little later, it happened that no part of his sojourn here was remembered with so much pleasure as the week he passed, in the country, with the bountifully endowed, the appreciative, and warm-hearted Reginald Ware Remembering the Wold, therefore, always first and al- ways last, when he thought of America, he did not fail to mind him right pleasantly of the meeting with Mabel, which had so charmed and brightened the last hour of his stay. It was to him' what the fragrance might be to a pilgrim, of some flower, which, when turning, with heavy and shrinking heart, from -iis home, he had plucked. just within his own gate, and borne it far and borne it wide. Coming back again, after years of life-knowing too, from Reginald, that Mabel was married-he did not the less for that, curiously speculate as to the     238  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. woman which this child might have become. He had accepted Eugene's invitation, and had come to the Wold, prompted rather by curiosity than any other motive. He came to resolve him of certain doubts. Philip and Mabel, sometimes alone, but oftener with Eugene, rode and walked through all the haunts of the place, and the days went on wings at the Wold. Once, at the grateful, cooling close of a certain sultry day, they were all in the verandah watching the rising of the moon. The heavy odors of the flowers, closed in all day, and now unloosed again, were thick about them. Mabel sat with her harp near her. She had learned this accomplishment since her marriage; and long be- fore, lhad learned goodly store of the richest and dearest ballads of our English tongue. The two gentlemen, leaning against the balustrade, had been smoking fragrant segars from the Havana. Eugene had just lighted a fresh one. Little Floy was romping with her father's cane. Manbel sang. Philip drew near to hear. Eugene, with Floy, sauntered down to the farther end of the piazza, and up by the two, and down again, absorbed in happy thoughts. Philip drawing nearer, sat him down by the singer's side. The song she was singing wIls a simple and touching ballad, of a soldier lover's blithe return. Breaking off from it, however, she paused a moment, took another strain, and sang out, in rich and meaning tones, a lyric for the hour.   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.             289 L Who bids convention rule the mind, Stale custom thwart the soul- Deems holy loves unholy loves, Out-running priest's control; The heart doth call poor Reason's thrall, Prates of pale Duty's ties,- His creed is old, his speech is cold, His mouth is full of lies. IL There is no treachery like our own, First treason to ourself; Sweet freedom bartered, what are all Life's gauds but wretched pelf; And this false part, my traitor heart Did league in, against me- Oh, tell me now, I pray thee, how Once more I may be free. If death could buy the serf's release, The purchase should be mine; The happy heart-its ransom paid, In death, should yet be thine. And I could smile that happy while, In paying price so great. Resolve me now, I pray thee, how To win this sweet estate. IV. The fabled cord so hopeless hard, That bound the quick and dead, Most meetly symbols this hard ring, Which binds two souls unwed;     240   THEE  HEART   OF  MABEL   WARE. But solve me where-oh, hlopeless prayer- Where ends this symabol round? Alas, 'tis whole, then so my soul Must at the last be found. The song ceased.   The two sat mute.    Eugene, romping with his darling, came by toward that end of the balcony, and by   again, and down   among  the shadows. Philip, turning to Mabel, found her in passionate tears. With  native delicacy, he avoided speaking; and when Eugene passed again, answered the idle re- mark he made, to save AMabel the pain of. replying. Then taking the harp from Mabel's hand, he sang in his low, sweet voice, to a mournful air, a lover's Tilere is a word, a thrilling word, That I must say not- A pulse by thy dear presence stirred, That hence must play not. There was a hope, a hope I dare No more to chllerish; I had a dream, unrivalled fair,- Too fair to perish. My heart was brave, my arm was strong, Arm and heart are weak now; My lips were running o'er with song, Only sighs they speak now.   I         THE HEART   OF MABEL WARE.     241 My life to nature's music high, Glad time was keeping; Tear-drops never dimmed my eye, Now-I am weeping 1 Mabel leaned over the harp, close beside which Phi- lip sat, and looked down into his upturned eyes. Her hand dropped from playing among the strings, and hung at her side. Philip looked up at the moon. It went just then behind a sombre cloud. He looked down the balcony. Eugene's back was next them. He took the hand which hung so near him, and pressed it hurriedly and unresisted to his lips. Eugene turned.   The moon came out and smiled serenely.  The little hand hung white and unspotted as before at Mabel's side. The two remained pale as statues, while Eugene walked calmly down the long piazza, watching the blue smoke that curled about his head, unconscious of the ghastly mists of dishonor that wreathed his heart and gloomed about his hearth. He went by without speaking. Philip -looked after the unconscious figure as it passed --and this man, so used as he was to social deceits, well accustomed in comprehending the desperate fic- tions of Life, felt his heart smite him as he saw the happy husband and father go by, all unconcerned. He grew paler as he sat. His heart felt cold, and his pas- sion was rebuked.     242  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. Again the husband passed, and his face was from the cheaters. This time I do not know whether any som- bre cloud hid the moon; but there hung the white hand, and there lay the other hand which had grasped it, and there were the lips which had pressed it, yet Philip stirred not. Mabel glanced furtively down, but met no ansswering glance. She looked down the garden walks and sighed. She looked to the cloud that had been over the moon. She looked into the cloudless sky- depths, but she felt no touch. Again Eugene passed and repassed in silence. Then Mabel turned, and bent down over the cold statue of a lover by her side. Her hand and white arm fell curved like a wreath upon his head, and glided down about his neck. His softly-whispered name was in his ear. Her breath was on his brow, her breath fanned his eyes, her breath was on his mouth, and her lips greeted his lips, with a wily winning hint-a sweet and damning hint. When Eugene came that way again, Philip sat alone with his hand wandering the harp-strings at its own unconscious will; and when the other asked for Mabel, she had gone in, for fear of the dew, as Philip said.   HIow yo lovers love to calle, Back- the houre which, most of all Houres or years of all the past, Sped So sweethe, Would not last- Fled so fleethe, Fled so fast. Coldly Duty bids " be still," Untoe hearts that will have will, Silverly doth Honor lure Reason cries, "be chaste, be pure;" Virtue meekly bids, "endure." And ye lovers, turning, try, With pale face and weary eye, Try to turn their hearts away- Vainly plye a vaine essay.     6   XVIII. ti aummer-    Oset again. THE next morning was bright and beamy. Early went Philip to the garden; but not so early that he failed to find Mabel there. With her morning-dress, her gardening glves, her pruning-knife in hand, and her gipsey-hat, she looked larger indeed, but not very much older than she had looked-that other morning. Her eyes were lustrous, her cheeks flushed, and her form dilate with beauty. She was working at the en- trance of the summer-house. Greeting Philip as he approached, she said: "Philip, dost thou remember our first conversation?" Undoubtedly, how can I forget?" "It was in this garden, Philip." "Near this very spot, I believe. Nay, I think just within the summer-house, where you are now standing." "Here!-dost thou not remember drawing me close to thy knee, and asking me such compelling questions?" "This is the place, Mabel. I have forgotten what I said."     246  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. I hIave not." "All is sadly different now; is it not, Mabel?" "Sadlv, dost thou think?" 1 Most sadly." "Unalterably, though ;-Philip, dost thou know the name of this flower?" "The virgin's bower, I think." ' Wcll, it is now a long time since I have called it 'Philip's Clematis.'" "ow do you mean, Mabel?" "When we heard of thy rumored death. Dost thou not remember helping me to train this very flower that morning?-and so, when I thought tAee dead, I wept, and called the climber by thy name." "Ah, Mabel, let us sit here again." They seated them where they sat years before. Ma- bel's eyes were covered with her gloved hand The other hand Philip had taken and ungloved, and held it calmly and without sign in the old way. The bounti- ful light of the morning was about them. A singing- bird, on the slender bough of a cherry-tree above, poured out a loud and rich gush of song which drew their souls away after beauty and love. "Mabel, I think you love me." I And if I do, Philip-what then: is it strange? Have I not heard thy voice growing ever more musical for my hearing, than for other ears? Have I not felt   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       247 thy questing glance, thy probing words, going deeper into my heart than any other words or glance have ever been;--deeper and closer than any explorer be- side can ever go? If I do love thee, Philip, I cannot help it;-what then?" "I love you too, Mabel! Oh, be sure you do not out- love me, but-Mabel, remember! I am loving another man's wife." "Yes, oh yes-it is that! Remember?-can I ever for an instant free my heart from the oppressing con- sciousness? Oh, yes, it is that! Thy admonition was unneeded. I do remember, now and always; and therefore, because I can not forget, Philip, thou must leave Wahlen Wold, and leave me to be forevermore alone."  She withdrew her hand, gently but resoiutely, and rose to her feet. Her lover sprang to her side. He regained her hand. His face, until now pale and doubt- ful, beamed with animation. His eyes were full of hope and enterprise. From both, as he spoke, wore away the restraint which had held them before. Their tones were no longer calm and controlled but eager. "Ah, Mabel, do not banish me. I swear to you I can not go if I would. My love is not an idle passion that can be bidden be still. Do not condemn me to essay what can not be accomplished! And, Mabel, forgive me, too! It was cruel to remind you of a bon-     248  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. dage so fearful, so fatal. It was needless, and yet, have you ever bethought you?-these ties are only human  Human resolution may spurn them away The world is wide! There are retreats where we may hide deep enough away." "Do not name it I I implore, I command thee, name it not!"-and her tall form dilated with womanly pride, her gesture grew queenly and imperative, and her eyes came bending upon her lover's eyes, a glance of proud and regnant rebuke. Ah! if at that moment he had turned him away with drooping head and yielding mien-if then, he had sought the ground with abashed regard, and been mute before the compelling reproach of those startled eyes, it would have been another tale for the writing now. But he neither turned nor yielded. His eyes met hers with a more potent glance than her own. His voice went on unsubdued and urgent. "Nay, Mabel, but I will name it, for I must. I urge you to no haste. I only beg you to think, that the ties which bind you, so against your will, are only hu- man. A word of yours, made them strong. A con- senting word"--and he bent down to her drooping head, speaking low and deep-toned, "a consenting word, dear label, shall undo them forever! Nay, I know all that you might say of duty, and honor, and wifely faith; yet Mabel, what are these but empty   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.      249 sounds? Your wifely faith I tell me, where is it now? nay, do not weep! You could not keep it! Your duty? remember it is only by an arbitrary, a mere hu- man, system of customs that your duty is due to this man, your husband. You were betrayed into an un- natural marriage. Perhaps you sinned in yielding to that; but be sure you will not be absolved by heaping sacrifices forever on a shrine where worship is not due. Duty? it is not to him, since you do not love him-but to me-if you love me-that duty is due. Nay, nay dear Mabel, do not weep for your honor! Bethink you, and if you love me well, say I will it be brighter in his keeping, to whom the tyranny of custom alone compits it, or in mine to whom your own heart would trust it in unfaltering confidence?" But still, Mabel, drooping her fair head indeed and' weeping the while, yet unconvinced, had courage to silence her pleading heart, and say to her pleading lover, "Nay." "Name it not, again I beseech-I command thee 7/ again name it not! I have confessed my love-; let it' be enough, for I can not yield! I flung away, at the fatal altar-at the cruel hungry altar, I flung away 'like the base Judean' my eternal jewel--the freedom of my soul. Do not speak of rights or duties. I have no rights now! I may not even think; and duty is bondage. Leave me, I pray, and forever 1"     250  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. "But Mabel, dear Mabel, consider the years-the in- terminable years which will come so drearily and wear so wearily away. Have you courage for these?" "They will be long, indeed, and very terrible; but they will not be interminable!" "Yet, remember, Mabel, each of us must endure them alone!" "Oh Philip, thy words torture me I Be generous! Rather assist me in my extremity, than aid the tempta- tion which so nearly overpowers me." Mabel sank from the seat where they were sitting, to her knees besides her lover. She clasped both his hands in hers, and looked appealingly into his ardent eyes, while her own eyes filled with tears as she spoke:- "Philip, thou hast not forgotten thy mother, who is dead, nor thy young sister who is in heaven. Thou rememberest the happy little girl who stobd here at thy knee, years ago-not many years ago-and answered thy questions with wondering and innocent delight. Thou knowest too, all that I am now-wearing a bur- den too grievous; denied to love thee, whom I can but love. Thou canst see how it is withering me away, immaturely; that I shall be dying soon-that soon I shall be dead; and I have no shame to own to thee, that I love thee, and thee only. I can not, I would not con- quer it; yet I must not yield! Oh, Philip, by thy   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       251 mother's sacred memory; by thy love for thy angel sister; by the native honor of thy heart, the nobleness which makes thee the man I am driven to love; by thy love for me, I pray thee, I implore thee, be gener- ous! Forbear to tempt me, and rather help me to re- sist thee, than beckon me downward to my ruin i" The hard and accustomed man was mightily wrought upon. His eyes were tearful, and his voice was un- steady. He bent over Mabel's beautiful head, and raised her tenderly to her feet. He saluted her fore- head with grave and stately tenderness. "Mabel," he said, "I will help you! You are a brave and noble woman. Reginald would be proud to know his ward, as I know her! I, myself, will aid you against myself. I need not, however, leave Wahlen Wold. I, too, need aid, and you only can lend it me. Let us therefore league in mutual defensive alliance against ourselves." Then, parting and smoothing away her disordered hair, and saluting her once more with the same mourn- ful grace, he led her toward the house, talking pleasant- ly of the morning, the birds, and the garden flowers.     pm-FTaI'?- ----    Promises are faire, and soothe, Brave resolves are cheaply taken, Miens are tender, speech is smooth, But what hearte is aye unshaken  "Silverly doth honor lure." But the tempter's voice, be sure, Hath a dearer tone to win, Reaching hearts that pine to sin. Sin is comely, sin is faire, Sin unbinds her wealth of haire, And her eyes are bright below, And her round white breasts peep through; Every curve about her wais, Clamors sweet to be embraced; Dainty hands and feet has she, Her lithe-limbs 'twere joy to see. 12     O   i XIX. I  '          QCemgtatim+ Now went the days by sadly and slowly. Autumn had now begun to drench the world, with its combina- tions of russet and of gold. There came a weary time, a weary time. Philip and Mabel met now every day; sometimes in other presence, sometimes alone. :Both were con- strained, both unhappy, both for the most part silent. Sometimes, however, they indulged in long discursive conversations. Reining in their horses as they rode, to a gentle walk, or 4itting down to rest on a fallen tree, while the others still gathered the pattering chestnuts. Always their conversations were full of repinings. They seemed to find a relief in constantly acknowledg- ing to each other the love which they were not per- mitted to entertain; though, as often, they deemed it necessary to avow their firmness of resolution; and at such times Mabel always asked and received the promise of Philip's support. And what was this? He promised     256  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. to aid her in her forlorn task, by example, by word and by deed. He promised not to tempt her, and he applaud- ed her sacrifice; but there was in his tone, in his eye, in the very fact of his assent, that which overthrew all beneficent influences of his words, and made more im- perious and irresistible the flow of Mabel's passion. She felt sometimes, often indeed, while yet he talked with her, strong in her resolution, and brave to endure; but, was it intentional, or was it the result of a con- stantly recurring and an unconquerable impulse which at such moments beset him?-I know not how it was; but there was always at the close of these fair fine words, which lent Mabel such strength of purpose, a pensive look, a hand-touch, or, sometimes perhaps, a lip- touch, so suggestive that it scattered away her new courage like leaves on the wind, and whirled away her heart, her hopes, her imagination down the grooves of possible happiness, until her thoughts were lost and her head dizzy. She always wished that their conversa- tion had ceased before that last turn; that they had parted a poor five minutes earlier, yet now -- it was Destiny. Philip Sutherland, generous as his impulses were, in behalf of this woman-and they were so generous that he had truly resolved to stifle down his love for her, was yet not the less, the same proud man who. loved to be strong for the defence and support of the weak. It   H TTHE HEART OF MABEL WARE.          257 !!t gratified his pride to be able to overmaster his own pas- sion before Mabel's eyes, and then turn and proffer a moiety of his strength to her. And so he did not fail 2 (constantly to uphold her in her purpose; but in all he was constantly haunted by the impulse to withdraw this aid for a moment, and remind her, how heavily she was leaning upon him; how, without his aid she     would be thrice lost. He never held her up long enough and steadily enough to let her become serene and whole, but constantly pulled her a little back and a little down. It was base, it was unmanly, it was not  *  generous,-and yet, I aver, it was in obediencet o an im- pulse which every proud man would have felt, and to which many who are not reckoned base or unmanly, but who are called generous, would have yielded. Sometimes, too, Philip and Mabel ventured to wan- der-with many a hastily interposed protest the while- into the paths of speculation, concerning the moralities of their position, the philosophy of their denial, and the criminality of their yielding to an impulse which urged flight. And here, too, Philip always assumed a lower tone of ethics, and argued for their entire in- tegrity of conscience, and spotlessness of honor in the hypothesis. "The very soul and essence," he said, "of marriage, the condition essential to its integrity, and absolutely necessary to make it true and holy, is mutual love.     258  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. But you do not love your husband; and therefore, the connection you hold with him, has none df the charac- terizing purities of the sacred institution. It is with- out harmony, and therefore, without sanctity. Who ever heard of a sacred discord-in chimes like these? The promise you made then at the altar, however for- tified by tokens and pledges ever since, is barely and simply a promise; with no other significance, and no other binding quality than any other promise,-and may be broken for reasons which are potent enough to win you from any pledge." "But think, to do this, how dreadfully it would be to deceive Eugene," said Mabel--- "I grant you that," broke in Philip. "I grant you that. The man who has clasped you unforbidden to his heart, and who has dreamed so confidently that your soul held his image, as your eyes now hold the moon-in the depths"-for this was at night, when they were conversing thus, and Mabel was gazing at the moon, while Philip stood looking down into her face-" that man will wake, if wake he must, from the dream of fatal beauty to madness and death. Indeed, Mabel, I think it could hardly be borne, for to deem one's self dowered with your love,-ah, I know how sweet it is. But however dreadful, it would not be a deception, Mabel. The deception is, in continuing to bid Eugene nurse the belief which some day must be   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.      259 given up. For Mabel, strong as you are and brave, you need not hope to go from this to your grave, for- ever wearing the mask of affection so studiously, that affection's eyes will be deceived. Oh, I pledge you my word, you will fail. You have set yourself a task too vast, too magnificent. You must abandon it, or fail miserably in the attempt." "But, Philip, remember, there was a time, only a few months ago-before we went to that fatal altar- when, at the sacrifice of a- little peace, a little quiet, a little regard of friends, and at the cost of a little reso- lution, a few tears-my own cost too-I might have drawn back, and been forever free; and now, what sacrifices .of honor, of reputation, of virtue, what cost of broken ties, of desolate home, of cruel tales on every tongue, of agony of heart-costs, too, now not all my own-must buy for me the freedom, I dared not pur- chase at a rate so cheap before. Ought I not, there- fore, to bid my clamoring heart be still and suffer, rather than win so precious a boon, at another's despe- rate purchase? Ah, Philip thou knowest well, I ought." "Nay, Mabel! again and again I assure you that I am not able to look upon marriage, in the same custom- stale style with which you persist in regarding it.: It is true, that you might, at one time, have avoided the thraldom which is so bitter; but it is true, too, that     260  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. you may yet escape that thraldom. Forgive me if I say, that in failing to avoid it, you sinned. Therein I believe you did a great-perhaps the greatest possible -wrong to Eugene, and lent your aid to outrage your- self. And if now you must pay a price for freedom, tenfold greater than before, why, you can not but see that the added suffering is the direct penalty and conse- quence of the former sin. I say this, not, Mabel, by way of reproach; but I may remind you, that next to this greatest wrong, the most bitter injury which you can inflict upon your husband, is the long deceit which you daily practice; and from which, some day, he must and will be free." "Oh, Philip, Philip, cease! thy words torture me i! Where is now the aid of thy promise?" I "Nay, Mabel," he replied, with a sudden start, "you have misapprehended the drift of my remarks. We are only speaking of the supposed case. I was con- tending, perhaps too warmly, that even if we should forget the relations--which we are both resolved not to forget, you know--yet, the act would not necessarily involve any self-humiliation, any sequestration of honor and self-respect." So, setting himself right in a manner, which drew from Mabel a sigh of weariness, rather than relief, they went their way.  And this was the manner of their conversations. Mabel the while, always w earily pro-   ?

Yet, both were resolute. 12*       Ye blind husband is a rover; Thick temptations crowd to prove her; Fear, and love, and passion move her; Conscience to thy task, reprove her I Guardian spirits haste to hover Quick and warningly above her I! -'Tis too late, the strife is over; Tardy angels I s]owe reprover!

XX. I     X MiVttrtns Bightl-tto to Harkne. O ONE day, a little later in the season, Eugene had gone away in the morning to attend a fair, of which he was an officer, and had sent a messenger in the even-     ing to say that he should be detained from home for the night. Philip and Mabel sat again that evening on the verandah, and this time they were uninterrupted. But this time they did not sing responsive songs, nor did their hands meet now  in those sudden touches which had so moved and thrilled them both before. Each was silent-busy with secret thoughts. Now and then, one or the other, arousing for a moment, uttered some casual remark, but all that was said seemed alien and unfit. The speaker suddenly fell hushed, and silence and sadness brooded over them again. It was a hot and murky night. The air seemed charged with extremities of languid heat, and sur- charged with hurtful and heavy vapors. All through the sky little flashes of light struck silently backward     26]  T THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. and forward from cloud to cloud. Ominous murmurs went over the feverish earth, and there were portents of a quick storm abroad in the heavens and on the ground. The oppressive sluggishness of the atmosphere seemed to overweigh Mabel's senses; and her thoughts went back to the past, came up and leaped shudderingly over the present, and ran forward far into the future, but wherever she turned, nowhere could she find a drop of cooling water for her drinking-a breath of fanning air for her breathing. So she sat with Philip, but alone; so she repined at her lot; so she shrank from all thought of escape, because each thought brought with it a thought of shame; so she endeavored to think of her fatal bondage, and strove to chide her spirit into acquiescence-until her heart beat faintly and more faint. Scalding tears-which yet did not bring relief-came and filled her eyes. She wondered that Philip-sitting a little apart-did not notice that she was sobbing. She thought it unfeeling in him, that he failed to come and soothe her. She longed to go to him; but there was something in his aspect that re- pelled her. In obedience to a sudden impulse, she left him in silence, and unrecalled, and went to her room to sleep a troubled sleep. Sutherland, too, inured to various climature, and too vigorous in body and in mind, to be disheartened by a   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       267 foul sky, yet had in his heart pulses that beat respon- sively to these seasons of depression. He was sad and mute when the last red gleam died in the west, and left the heavy, heated air, darkened too. He listened to the moan of the wood, and the croaking of the frogs on the river-banks-far away one would think, but seeming in such an atmosphere, tremulously near. Long masses of hazy shapes were congregating blackly in the sky about Reginald's Peak, and from one to an- other of these, and backward and forward these among, played all the evening small, subtle blazes, giving no report, but revealing in sudden outlines, now this side, now that, now this detached pinnacle, now yonder sharp crag, and now the highest peak of the mountain. Gazing long thereaway, Philip thought not of the scene. His mind wandered to his boyhood.   He thought of his stately father; of his pictured mother, whose soul-so they had taught him in infancy-was in heaven; of his sister, tall and fair-haired, and dead, too, early dead; of his beautiful English home, and of his going thence for the first time away. And then he mused on, all along the path of his life. How long the wayside seemed! How strange, that eyes so young as his, could look backward with a glance so reaching and far! Constantly, the while, the thought of Mabel recurred. If he gazed at the flashes in the sky, he saw her still;     268  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. and if he turned to the images of his fancy, her image intruded among them. He could not assoil him from. the token. At such an hour, too, when he could not be unjust to himself, searching his heart, as he could but do, he felt self-accused of the crime of coveting his neighbor's wife, his friend's, his host's wife; and his honor strove in vain to cast off, and be rid of the stain. It was in vain, that, acknowledging their mutual passion, he pro- tested that it should be subdued. In vain he said to himself, "I love this woman, but I will conquer the passion. She, too, loves me, and has acknowledged as much; but the untimely affection must be banished from her heart. Honor and manly virtue restrain me; purity and wifely duty forbid her to yield. We un- derstand each other, too, and we are agreed, that this wicked affection shall not be nourished. She is a brave woman. She will not fail. I have promised also, to aid her, by philosophy, by self-restraint, by encouraging words, and by mutual endurance, to conquer, and be free from this reproach upon her womanly pride." It was all in vain that he endeavored with these, and with other specious arrayals of the matter to satisfy his awakened conscience. His clear intellect went fatally through all the pretentious fictions, and he saw the truth undisguised. He felt, too, how imperfectly he had kept his promise to Mabel. He was aware that he   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.      269 had ventured to play with so subtle and dangerous a thing as the human heart, and he reproached himself with the perfidy. He resolved-and now he had risen, and went pacing up and down the dark portico, for Mabel had gone now-that to-morrow he would make preparations for his departure, and that in a day or two at the most, the whole dream should be past, and he would be awake once more. 'He grew stronger and freer of heart as he settled this resolution in his mind. The night seemed to have lost a moiety of its gloom. The air was not so heavy and hard to'breathe. Philip went to his room and slept as lightly and as heavily as a happy boy. That night there came upon them one of those ter- rific thunder storms which come in that climate after days of impurity and heat of atmosphere. A brief storm, which comes with the sweeping overhead of a black cloud, and goes with its going, but which seems while it lasts to rend and tear the world. Mabel sprang up from her broken sleep and gazed forth with awful wonder. The tempest had not yet reached the house, but she could see it a mile or two away, thick with crossing lightnings and loud with splitting peals of thunder. The winds too, began to spring up and rush here and there in quick frightened gusts. Swiftly it bore down upon them, like a living monster, and still more swiftly " it neared and neared."     270  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. Mabel saw that the house stood in its path, and with a sweeping thought for the safety of its inmates, sud- denly she remembered that the apartment in which Sutherland slept was in a part of the house, beyond the protection of the steel conducting-rod. And even now the storm burst upon them in its first fury. Without a provident thought, but for his safety, she ran through the rooms and halls until she reached the apartment where he slept. She bent to listen. In the lulls of the tempest she could fancy she heard his breathing. She called but he did not answer. She beat the door with her bands. She called him loud and loud, and still beat the door. Then she caught the sound of his voice. He had heard her, and she grew still. He was coming forth, and now she felt her face grow full of blood, as she thought how small an errand had brought her to his door, at midnight. Now she remembered too, her dishabille-that she was clad only in the dress of a summer's night; and she turned quick to fly; but he had come forth now, and she could only trust to the darkness. Now too the storm grew louder and more dreadful. She lost her shame in fear. Unable to make him hear, she took his hand and led him swiftly away to a safe parlor.   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.-       271 Philip at once comprehended the danger and saw why Mabel had aroused him. The two stood each holding the other's hand, and neither speaking while the storm howled out its brief wrath around the strong house. Sometimes the flashes made it suddenly so light that Philip could see Mabel's white face, and her abundant hair falling wildly down across her damp brow, wreathing her white and indistinctly seen shoul- ders. Her lips were parted, her head turned partly away, and her eyes tremulously startled. Philip stood by her side, holding her hand and watching steadily for the strong flashes that gave each time an unsatisfy- ing glimpse. Then the flashes came no more. Then they heard the noise of the storm rolling down the valley and growing far away. Still they stood listening. The calm that followed such thunder seemed sacred. They stood still. And what did they think, standing there in the si- lence?-alas, I can but conjecture, only I know that there was a tumult in their hearts that shamed the puny tumult of the storm. And how ended this silence; and how went they thence?-alas, that the silence was ever broken. When they went thence, they went-together-away-into the darkness.     272  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.

I                        ?iiXXI.  THE next morning when Mabel came early, with flushed face and feverous pulse, to her own room, the first beam of the rising sun looked into the chamber and laughed so derisively that she was fain to shrink away and hide her head, even in the solitude there, for shame. The morning was bright and gay when she came forth, but everything seemed strange and weird and wild. Who knows, whether to her eyes, and to eyes like hers, any beauty retains the same comeliness which invested it before? The most dreadful quality of other crimes is the benumbing influence they extend to those  fine faculties of the soul which are at first so sensitive to impressions of beauty and purity. Who can say     276   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. whether this crime, like others, has or has not the same hardening touch? Who can decide, that this sin, like other sins, leaves upon the tender vines of the soul's garden, the stain and unhealthiness of a cureless blight? Who can deny the consoling fancy, that, forasmuch as it was in yielding to these finest and tenderest feelings, that the sin was committed, it will be on other than these, that the suffering must fall-the sturdier and more superficial perhaps, as love of kindred, love of kind, and love of home-for ever it seems that atone- ment is by vicarage. When Eugene returned the next day he was wel- comed back by both these defilers of his honor. Deeply as they had injured himt they found itmore easy to endure his unsuspecting presence than to be alone with the rest of the household. The very restraint imposed on them bv his coming, was in one sort a freedom. They assumed the natural tones and themes, talked easily and pleasantly onward, looking when occasion made them look, straight into each other's eyes, with a calm serenity of glance, which only the necessary restraint could lend them. Accordingly, in the days that followed, Eugene al- ways found his wife on one side of him, and Philip on the other. Their conversation now was addressed to Lim, and if to each other, yet so as to include him. He could but notice the difference. He thought, "they seem to have exhausted each other!"   THE  HEABT OF MABEL WARE. . 277  There was, however, now a change, which Eugene      I observed, too, in Mabel's health. Her cheek grew pale.   l Her eye lost its fire. Her form seemed drooping and    : weary. She sang no more. She only answered what was asked her briefly. At night she did not sleep, but  - when the morning came she slept feverously. Eugene feared that she was falling into a consumption. , What was it?-Do you remember that morning         - when she came to her own room, how the sun laughed derisively? Alas, he always laughed derisively nowl  Everything seemed to know her-as she was. It ap- peared, in truth, that the very inanimate things which she loved, were informed with her secret. She could not be rid of the grotesque idea. Why, the birds,      i perched in her path, would wait until she came close, eyeing her the while with shameless curiosity, and then start quick as light away, and fly far, and dive here and there in mocking antics, as if glad to be beyond her. And the flowers-if she reached to pluck a delicate nestling blossom, a light blush went shivering across it, and it nestled lowlier away from her hot hand; while,   -i if she approached a tall, proud lily, or other glaring and bold flower, it leaned towards her, and looked into her eyes with a hateful sympathy of mutual conscious- ness, which made her shudder. There was a woman on the place, the wife of one of the tenants, a large, healthy woman, with a face white 13 ' s  ' *"2     278  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. and red, mirthful blue eyes, light hair and voluptuous form, concerning whom village gossip had been used to say, that her children were more like her husband's companions than like himself. The rumors were un- substantial, and unnoticed; but now, Mabel meeting this fair woman one morning, and receiving her greeting, saw in the bonny glance of her eyes, a strange, half- surprised familiarity, which made her pity the poor man, who called her children his, and at the same time, filled her with apprehensions, lest this wanton creature  should harbor in her white breast, like thoughts con- cerning her. Why, the very wind came boldly to her lips, and clasped her waist about wantonly, and, dallying with her curls, wound caressingly around her neck--the bold and saucy wind. And all sights came to her shame- oppressed eyes, without the sacred veil which before they had always worn. Philip, too, was anxious; but he had not the same need to wear the trouble in sight, on his brow or cheek. He could bid it deeper down. He knew how to wear cloaks and veils. Yet, now, he began to speak of his departure. Philip and Mabel now avoided being alone together by accident, and went to their meetings secretly and by appointment. He was urging her to fly with him, and seeking to prove to her, that after what had occurred, she now might and ought.   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.        279 To his reasoning she could answer nothing. To his proposal, she protested that she could not yield.              - But presently a new source of alarm came and made --- her tremble. Before, she had had no troubling thoughts of discovery; no idea of a revelation to Eugene of her infidelity. A " damned defeat" had been made of her husband's peace and joy; yet it had not occurred to her that he should ever know of it.      : But one morning, waking from sleep fresh and rosy, she found herself clasping Eugene in her arms, and pressing her lips hard to his mouth. He was only quietly smiling at her warmth; but oh, she shuddered and grew faint and sick as she remembered her dream. It had been Philip, not Eugene, who, a moment before, had filled her clasping arms; he, whose mouth her lips had been caressing; and she wondered that she had not, a score of times, murmured his name.        i Thenceforth when she went to sleep, she always turned her face to the wall, and gave it tremulously in   - charge to all her senses, that they should make no sign. Yet she trembled. She told this soon after to Philip, and thenceforth he urged her not only by love but by fear, to go beyond the danger of these fearful revelations of unconscious lips. She was impelled by fear. She was tortured by per  S was tortured by per-1  \'i1     280   THE HEART OF MABEL .WARE. plexity. She was drawn by love. She was urged by dislike; for now, since that fatal thunderous night, she could not receive Eugene's caresses. His touch had become hateful to her. His presence was repulsive. She felt oppressed with a consciousness of the living deceit she was practising upon her unsuspicious hus- band. She yielded, and the guilty pair went guiltily to work to plan their flight.   Meet it is whenne wrong is wrought, That ye cruel cheaters flie; Chepely so is freedom bought, From the dreadful cheated eye: Eye unconscious, cheated eye, Calmly failing to espie, What were death to be revealed, What is shame to be concealed.

The night is come. Philip waits with his carriage at the foot of the lane. Wrapped in his cloak, he paces impatiently back and forth before the carriage, speaking to the restless horses, and glancing up towards the dark. mansion. Mabel has stealthily left her husband's side, and arrayed herself for flight. No remorse assails her now. Her conscience is at rest, or if it gives her any sign, it wafts her forth. She is relieved to feel that sioe will never again lie down in the bed she has dishonored-- that no deceptions are for practising henceforth. She bends over the sleeper for the last time. She remem- bers the pleasant past; the early friendship, the lasting affection of those first years. Impulsively she deplores the mistaken union which had turned the sentiment to aversion; and by a strange, yet not unnatural, process of intuitive reasoning, she makes a magnanimous effort to forget the injury he has done her, forgives him in     284  THE  HEART OF MABEL WARE. her heart, and in the very act which is to shatter his happiness and hopes for ever-experiences a comforta- ble complacency at the exercise of a spirit so charitable. She steals to the window, and looks abroad, upon the scenes, now obscurely shaded, of her home. It is the same spot, whence she parted before, for a brief absence with so many tears. 'Yet it is not the same, for now she has no tears to shed, going from it for ever. Before she leaves the house, she has another mid- night parting look to leave. She bestows it at the bedside of her daughter. Alas, that my pen, of all the fearful words of this sombre story, must write these words--there was not even then, and even there, an impulse of relenting. Again the old savage mood comes and takes hold of her features, and her heart rises again in vehement protest against the ravished life that was hers, and is now beyond recall. Wist- fully, morosely she bends and gazes upon the innocent child. The greedy, protesting aspect, the attitude of wilful, unnatural desire-ah, it is too horrible I But let us breathe free again I There is a noise, startling in the stillness. Two or three clocks in the house strike the hour. The watcher starts like a guilty thing away. A softer gleam lights her face as she is leaving the room. She pauses. Contending emotions flit across her face. She draws near the bed again. Once, the first time-the last-only once-came the motherly   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE..       285 lips, with uncontrollable maternal impulse, down, softly, lightly-down through the darkness-to the poor child's parted lips. A moisture is in Mabel's eyes. A thrill is at her heart. She turns and -goes, but leaves a tender look in the dark room--a kiss, pure as a jewel, on the lips of the child--and is gone. A moment more, and she stands in the open night. She runs down the lane swift as a buskined huntress, bounding with exultation as she meets her lover, coming, in his impatience, to meet her. The carriage rolls down the same road where the other carriage went before; but other arms are round her and ano- ther voice cheers her now. They drive swift as fugi- tives through the straggling village, down upon the boat, and cry out quick and impatiently to rouse the old ferryman. The delay is cut short by fees, and the boat leaves the shore and gains the centre of the stream. The old ferryman is curious. Besides, he has heard and recognized Mabel's voice. He approaches the window and peers in. Mabel bends forward, affecting frankness, and bids him good-night.  * "Thee rides late, I'll allow, friend Mabel. Who's that other in thy carriage?" "My cousin, Cyrus-Eugene's cousin; he lives in town, where we are going by the next train. Come now, Cyrus, I'll warrant me, thy thought was of ano- ther matter-an elopement, perhaps. Oh Cyrus Hof 183     286  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. me, too, thy old pet;" and she laughed a loud forced laugh-as she ought not to have laughed that night, or ever. "In truth, Mabel, thy manner was so hurried, that mayhap I didn't like the look of it. But one oughtn't to judge of another now-a-days. Everybody has got strange whirls now. Since this pestilent fire-and-water folly came down this way, all the folks are pretty well turned o' their wits." Here they reach the shore. Presently they pass Mrs. Barbeyrac's great house. It is dark and gloomy; but darker and gloomier will it be before the next nightfall. The old ferryman hears the whistle of the coming train as he floats slowly back to the dark village. He sees, as he reaches the shore, the lights of the little steamers as they prepare to cross the river with the train's passengers. He stops and watches; and when his son remonstrates against the delay, calling him to come to bed, thinking another thought he replies that he will stay-muttering to himself the while: "We'll have another job this way, before a bit, I reckon." Reaching the city, the fugitives make no pause. Philip's arrangements are complete. In another hour they are whirled away toward a sea-port, where a little sailing vessel lies off in the very jaws of the harbor, with white wings already unclewed, waiting to be   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.      287. spread, and her smallest anchor just ready to be hove a-peak. The wheels go round swift as lightning. They have reached the port. A well-manned boat awaits them. The signal is given and taken. Oh, Philip Sutherland was a very accomplished manager. Where he had gained his experience-who knows? The oars are long, the strokes are strong. They mount the ship's side. The white wings spring out to their utmost stretch. Before the wet anchor drips from the capstan they are bounding away outward into the gray waste. ' "    *     "'*!       Fearfully it strikes to the heart, Whenne the friendly vaile doth part; Vaile that erst did hide ye woe, Its sore rifture now doth show. Swifthe, swifthe, this round world, Underneath their feet is hurled-- Feet that after vengeance runne, Feverish till the deed be done. Time alone canne them perplex, Toil and space but lightly vex.     I   XXIII. EUGENE wakes with a start, from a frightful night- mare. He reaches for Mabel's hand, to assure himself that it is all unreal. Mabel is not there. Perhaps she is gone to look after Floy's comfort; but just then lit- tle Floy comes into the room, seeking through the dark- ness for her mamma. "But, Floy," asks her father, A isn't your mamma in your room?" "No," says the child. "I had a beautiful dieam. Oh, I want to kiss mamma, dear mamma I Where is she? I can not find her. It is dark." "Wait, child. Mamma will come presently." Eugene thinks Mabel'is about the house, but-he won- ders where, and lights a night-lamp. The beautiful child, in her flowing white night-dress, standing before the bed, starts out of the darkness revealed by the sudden light. The quick glare hurts her eyes, and she shades them and rubs them with her little hands. Her     292   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. father draws her to him, kissing her fondly. Then, for the first time, he notices a disorder in the room. Some drawers are drawn in the bureau, and there is a con- fusion. He calls through the house, "Mabel! Mabel!" He runs to Philip's room. He, too, is gone. It must be some surprise these two are planning. He descends the stairs. On a centre-table is a note, which he grasps, tears open and hastily reads. All is explained. Then his brow grows dark with novel passion. The mild and pleasant man, starts rigidly up into the out- raged husband and the injured friend. He calls out, with a terrible energy that brings the servants at once about him. He orders his fleetest horse. He arrays himself for the saddle. Martha Ruggles is instructed to take Floy in the morning to her grandmother's. He gallops down the lane, and enters the black shade of the wood-a blacker shadow at his heart. He wakens the echoes of the village street-echoes hardly calmed since the other alarm. Cyrus Todd awaits him on the unmoored boat-but he has no second fare that night. Eugene pulls up to demand if a carriage has crossed, and how long since. The old man answers, making his preparations the while, but there is a way better ac- cordant with the fierce passions that burn in the rider's breast. Fording the shoals and swimming the pools, his brave horse gains the other bank. Stopping a mo- ment at his grandmother's dark house, to bid her a   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       293 hurried farewell, and to explain in one brief sentence, the extent of the desolation which has fallen on his home, he next draws rein at the station-house, rousing the sleeping attendants with an outcry so impatient, that they sleep no more that night. The next train townward would not pass'that way for two hours. Eugene knew that he could not reach the city sooner than- by waiting. Yet, there was that in his breast which made him spur fiercely forth into the darkness, along the road. He pressed his armed heels constantly to his horse's sides; and gnashed his teeth with impatience, as the slow fences and trees crept by him. His horse fell, but an inn was at hand; and his imperious bearing procured another with more speed than the heavy Dutch landlord could have been moved to by money. Once a train of cars met, and swept, howling, past him, and he th6oght how brief a time must: have elapsed since it came by the fugitives with the same roar. As his second horse was staggering, he heard behind him the rattle of the coming train. Fortunately, he had just passed a station-house. He ran back, and succeeded in flinging himself on the moving car. Arrived in town, he found little difficulty, but some vexing delay, in tracing the fugitives to the other rail- road. He reached the port whence they had sailed. -     294   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. The place was small. Every one knew of the sailing of the vessel during the night; some had seen a strange gentleman and lady embark on her; but her destina- tion was not known. Finally, an old sailor, whose son was a mate on the schooner, knew, and was bribed to mention the name of a small town in southern France, which his son had to'ld him was their destined port. Immediately Eugene remembered to have heard Philip mention this place with affection. It was the same place where he had been conveyed after having been picked up on the ocean. Eugene hurried back to town, exulting in the thought that he could fly to England under the black cloud of a steamship, that he could post down across France, from Calais, to the little sea-port town; and that, sail' she never so swiftly, he should arrive before the swift little schooner that bore the traitors. There, then, should- be their meeting. This little French town should be the scene of his terrible revenge. He did not revisit the Wold. His banker and lawyer lived in the city, and there he completed his necessary arrangements. From London, Eugene wrote to Reginald Ware, tell- ing him, without comment, the simple wretched truth; and adjuring him to come to the French village at once, and witness the end. In Paris, he found a college friend-Mr. Gifford-   THE   HEART OP  MABEL  WARE. J,295 to whom  he disclosed the mischief which a trusted friend had wrought him; and demanded his aid when they should " meet at compt."   His friend promised to join him in two days. He reached the port, and learned to curse his impa. tient haste, which had made the journey too short, for the fugitives were not yet arrived. Young Gifford came at the appointed time, and still the two were forced to wait. Gifford explored the scenery about the place, drank sour Bearnese wine, quarreled with a Gascon count, and made love to a vil- lage grisette, named Gilberte. Eugene walked up and down the weary beach, gazed seaward, and waited. 9     I       Sweet to the weary, sweet to the worne, Sweet to the fearful whose breast is torn With prickings of love, and stings of remorse; Oh sweet is rest, and ye restward course.

IT was pleasant, after the great toil and turmoil of such a night-the crowning turmoil of her perturbed married life-for Mabel to see the shores go bluely down out of sight behind her; to watch the ceaseless march of the long-ranked billows; and to feel about her the bracing embraces of the compelling winds. Philip, too, seemed moved by the same benign influences. His manners were not now reserved, as they were wont to be; but joyous as a boy's. His glances were full of love; his voice musical and happy. -They were not old, these two, but, after the maturing experiences of; the recent past, they now seemed to grow young every day. They were not sorry when the retarding winds or the hindering calms came and checked their course. They could well wait. Mabel had never been on the water before, and the ocean had for her a wonderful richness of novelty. Philip loved it too, and felt a sort of pride, as Mabel wondered at all that was so familiar to him.     300  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. Nor were the sweet moods of happiness which now, every day, and all day long, possessed them, marred by the black shadows of their crime. The cloud of shame and remorse which rises, when any great wrong is wrought, to hide the pleasant sun away, leans far forward; and many unshadowed days intervene be- tween the sin and the drear shade of it. Hardness of heart, and uneasiness of mind, which are the fruit of vice, spring not up at once to wretched fruition. The seed, like other seed, lies hid in the mould of the heart's garden; and, springing up duly, is at first no more than a fragrant blossom, and later, a little germ, and later, a bitter crudeling. Long years ripen it to poison maturity, and other years-years too slow- bring decay and death. It is not true, that all the ways of sin are thorny ways, and all her uses bitter. It is not true, that all the great treasures of bright names and white fames, of heart's ease and soul's loss, of charges undischarged, and duties unheeded, and ties daringly snapt asunder, that have been paid down--the exchanges, oh I! most unequal barter, of purities for in- famies, and of faith's serenity for integrity flawed and shattered beyond repair, that have been made-heavy prices wherewith, since the world began, so many sweet and noble, aye, and loyal hearts, have been ready- to purchase absoluteness of affection; it is not true, that all these grave and heavy prices have been paid down   THE. HEART OF MABEL WARE.      801 for naught-trafficked for a fair promise never ful- filled. Who of them all, wretched, despairing, dying, would go calmly back, resign the thrilling purchase, and be forevermore without the sweet memory of it, if so they might even have back again the price they paid?                   , Mabel and Reginald?-what to them were the cries of pain and rage, the murmurs of scorn that might be sent out after them, but which could never reach them? What to them was the darkness they left behind, while their happy eyes were dazzled by the glad light that beckoned them? What to- them were the barbed' doubts and hurtling sneers of all gazers-to them, each soobuciklered by the other's love? What?-why, what was the ocean with its leaping billows, but the path that led them to happiness? What the,great sun and the tender stars, but beacons. to herald them on their bliss. ful way? What were the swift winds, the gentle calms, and the gentler breezes-what the round world itself but loving subjects of their love, pleased agents of their pleasure? Now, they fell into lower latitudes, and the sun was warmer and the airs were more balmy. They began to anticipate their home. Time wore away. To-morrow, if the wind did not veer, the captain thought they might see land, though he did not " like the look of the sky," and intended to "keep her away" during the night. "     802  THE HEART OF MTABEL WARE. And so they retired, thinking--"To-morrow we shall be there!" But in the dead night a great cry arose. In the night "the storm-blast came, and he was tyrannous and strong." The sea had been rough before, and their little bark was laboring heavily; but in the night, a sudden, desperate hurricane swept down over those scas with blackness of darkness and with terrible mut- terinos. The great waves that towered up so high and wore their snowy crests so loftily, went down pallid and shiverinc to the flat surface. The frail vessels that lay in the tempest's path, gave a great struggle, and went slowly down where they lay; before the wretches in them had time to mutter a hasty prayer. The strong vessels fell down, each on its side, and lay like one stunned with a quick blow. But their captains came out in haste and desperate energy; and called madly through their trumpets, orders which no man could hear; and with gestures and signs only they made their sailors cut great ropes. The tall and beautiful masts, of which they had been so proud, went, drifting, to be seen no more; and each ship, with lurches like the choking sobs of a child, regained itself and stood erect in the water; but ah! how different from the stately creatures that fell down. Then the old sailors in each, crowded to the helm, and each one was got before the wind. Many were found to have sprung ghastly leaks,   THE  HEART OF MABEL WARE.       303 and on these all hands went bailing and pumping for life. In some, the people stopped pumping directly, and presently went down, where the frail vessels had gone before. In others, they hoisted out pitiful little boats, and struggled with each other for a passage to death-to death. Others still pumped on, and prayed the while for morning and for aid. Other ships, a few, had no leaks, and' scudded down fast and shivering before the hurricane. Some of them, the lightest and the fleetest, were far before the others. And the people on the slow and heavy sailers, smiled to each other, at thinking how sluggish their own crafts were, while these light ships went by them. For every one knew of a rough shore a little way to the leeward, and every one wished for a hundred miles of open sea ahead. Still the terrific gale swept the ocean with undiminished violence.     d   The ocean is false as a friend canne be, But ye land is hard of heart as a foe; The false one's guiles we parry with wiles, And shrink from the enemy's wrecking blowe.

REGINALD WARE had not received Eugene's sum- moning letter directly. When it came, however, he hastened, with great forebodings of heart, to arrive at the sea-port before these two men should meet. He remembered that Eugene was the son of the fiery-tem- pered Joe Barbeyrac, who had been his earliest friend; and he read in the hasty letter, that he was a desperate and blood-thirsty man. He knew, too, that when he should cast his vehement rage upon the polished and worldly Sutherland, it would be like the vain beatings of the surge upon the patient rock. He knew that the contest between them must be prevented, or that it would be a contest to the death. He hurried away; and, as he posted down through that poor and pensive but fair country, a hundred plans of pacific intent were conceived and abandoned in his brain. Obstinacy and pride and passion he felt were before him to :contende with.     308'  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. Ten leagues of his journey remained, his land- lord admonished him, as he finished his bottle at the post-house cabaret, while the fresh horses were being harnessed to the carriage; but he believed it could not be so much. Evidently the man was hospitable he secured no guest, however, that night. The night fell heavily and luridly and threateningly. Reginald urged his postillion on. His heart was full of fear. He doubted that he was only going to be a passive witness of a tragedy which he could not pre- vent. He shuddered at the thought that the desperate husband had already met the seducer, and had quenched the fire of his hate in slaking blood. The darkness came on deeper and deeper, and even- ing was lost in midnight. The road on which he was travelling came out, at the distance of two leagues from his destination, from the open country, upon a high cliff; and for the remainder of the route, wound along near its edge. Just as they reached this cliff, and 'turned their horses' heads toward the village, a great roar reached their ears, coming from the sea. The winds sprang up at random, blowing now here now there; now, sweeping by in fitful gusts, now falling still, as if bending down to the ground to listen, and now trembling with agitation. The horses snorted, reared and plunged in the traces, and sought to turn upon each other in their terror.   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       309 Reginald, looking seaward and listening to the strange roar, immediately conjectured that a hurricane was upon the waters; and his other fears lost themselves in the new fear that Mabel and her lover were exposed to its fury. And now he could distinguish out in the darkness, a blacker and more opaque line of blackness. He could see it, as his eyes became sharpened, appa- rently approaching; and for a time it seemed about to strike the cliff at their very stand-point. It came, growing denser, and with better defined outline, but swept by, a league before them. The ac-. companying wind, indeed, almost overturned them once or twice, and it needed their combined strength to restrain the frightened horses. But the force of the first shock spent, the wind which followed was strong indeed and threatening, but they began once more to go forward through it. As they crossed the tornado's path, houses, trees, everything, was torn and scattered in ruin. With great difficulty and hindrance they made their way through the ruins, and pressed on. The countrypeo- ple were striving to pull out their goods from the wrecks of their houses, and were talking the while of vessels, seen the day before in the bay. Through them all, over the obstructions, and against the mighty wind, Reginald urged his postillion on; until, now, they drew near the village. People were "*     310   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. in the streets though it was almost morning. The ser- vants at the inn ran hither and thither, like people dis- traught. They were quite willing to talk indeed, but seemed wholly unable to commence their duty by attention to the horses. There was much confused talking, about the gale, about the houses blown down, about the people dreadfully mangled, and last-it was now beginning to be gray in the morning-and last, it was said that three vessels had been stranded and beaten to pieces just off the harbor; and that a fourth was now beating about, a little farther away, endeavor- ing with every skill of seamanship to wear out the gale without falling on the shore. Reginald could not retire. He made his way, his heart oppressed with anxiety, to the beach. A multi- tude of people were there; and boats, with coils of rope, were beached, all ready to attempt a rescue. In one of these boats, Reginald saw by the flaming torch-light, that a young man of foreign garb and aspect, had taken the rudder, evidently against the remonstrances of ano- ther man, wrapped in a cloak, who seemed to dissuade him from the adventure. But the young man would not be prevented. He pushed the cloaked one from him, and motioned the daring crew to give way. Their long strokes sent them forth, the crowd cheered as they sulcceeded in riding over the breakers, and they were lost in the darkness. By all this, Reginald knew that   THE HEART?F MABEL WARE.       8" the vessel had stranded, and directly he saw the flash of her signal-gun. Another boat started, was bilged, and two of her crew drowned. A third was successful, and they lost sight of it outside the breakers. The ship was lying, less than a mile away, high upon a reef of rocks. It was the vessel that had clung so pertinaciously to the idea of safety. Reginald, with all the crowd, watched. Suddenly a hand was on his shoulder. Eugene was behind him-the cloaked stran- ger. His cheeks were hollow, his eyes were sunken, his whole aspect was haggard. He pointed to the stranded ship, and made signs at the boat which had disappeared. He placed his mouth close to Reginald's ear, and shouted, "My friend has gone in one of the boats I I could not go! Lest I should not be here! To meet them-you know!---But, what if they are blown by this wind, and never come? I should have no revenge! Oh, it would be too horrible!"  He wrung Reginald's hand, and turned him again to watch. But, ah what a change came over him! Now the light was stronger! Now they could see the awful condition of the wreck, and could begin to discover the people on her decks. They could see one of the boats --only one-and they knew that the other, with the brave and good men, was lost. The boat was close under- the vessel's side. Two or three persons descended and found places in her. The     812  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. waves forced her suddenly, ten fathoms away. Just then appeared on the deck of the ship the white night- dress of a woman. Again the boat was brought under the vessel's side. The woman was safely lowered down. Others crowded over the bulwark. The little skiff was about to be swamped. But one, who seemed to direct all, was seen in gesture and attitude to remonstrate. Still the crowd came madly on; but this man alone cast himself before them, and for a moment withheld them. He was seen to cut with a knife the rope that held the skiff, and she parted. Seeing these things, Eugene suddenly threw away his cap and cloak, and ran like a madman up and down the beach. The boat came safely to the land. Reginald held Mabel in his arms, while Eugene roughly wrung her hand, and shouted his rude demand for Sutherland. But at the name, Mabel, too, sprang up with sudden energy. She waved her arms in frantic gestures to- ward the wreck. She ran from group to group of the men who stood on the sand, and begged them to launch another boat. Failing in this she would have cast her- self into the sea, but was withheld by force. But now, Eugene sprang to a boat. Once and again he called out fiercely and sharp for volunteers. Regi- nald, at Mabel's command, and Mr. Gifford, had each taken an oar. Two brave fellows were found, and the   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       313 skiff went gallantly out. Mabel ran to the highest ele- vation of the beach, and looked eagerly on. When the boat had made half the distance, a great wave struck away the last defence; the billows went over the wreck, and the water was filled with wretches. Eugene saw it all; but the others, with their backs to the boat's bow, saw none. Mabel saw it; but she had noted Philip's form, and now sinking on her knees, and holding her hand hard to her heart, she strove to dis- cern that loved form amidst the billows. Eugene's eye was fixed. In the confusion of the breaking up, he had not lost sight of Sutherland. Dis- regarding all others, he left the drowning to the right, the drowning to the left, and urged his rowers on. It was his own hand that plucked his enemy from death. A shout went up from the shore. A wild cry went up above the shout; a woman's cry of exultation; and Mabel was borne fainting, away to a cottage. No other was picked up. No word was said. Philip, self-possessed all the while, had seen Eugene and Regi- nald.  He comprehended the whole at a glance. He had seen Mabel safely landed. He was aware that he owed his life to the man he had so injured; but he was ' conscious, too, that his life had been saved only for the luxury of taking it again. So, he did not speak. So, he proudly met and baffled the glances which fell on him.  So, his heart grew collected, and -his limbs grew strong, and his mien grew proud, at every stroke.     314  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. Reaching the land, Sutherland sprang ashore; in- quired of the nearest stander-by where the lady had been conveyed, and hurried away to the hut where she lay insensible. Eugene and Reginald walked slowly to the inn. a  a   Statelie rites they seem, and high Light words said, or small deeds done; When we thinke o' the morrow's sun, They who speak or doe, will die.     I   XXVI. H a raftions REGINALD spent the day that followed, mostly with Mabel. They spoke little, and all they said had unim- portant reference to the events of the day; nor ever went farther back than that. Mabel dared not, and delicacy prevented Reginald from touching on the past. To have seen them, one would say, they had never met before. Mr. Gifford had called promptly in the morning, and delivered a note to Philip, which neither of them had read, but the purport of which both knew. Both were dismayed, yet they felt that silence became them best. Reginald had, indeed, made an attempt to mollify Eu- gene; but he had said: "My wife is in his arms; my honor is under his feet! How would you do, if the case were yours?" and the peace-maker was silenced. He had also approached Philip, concerning the possi- bility of avoiding the bloody catastrophe. But Philip too, in his turn, had replied: "I have stained his honor.     318  TEE HEART OF MABEL WARE. I have seduced his wife. Shall I refuse him any poor satisfaction that he may demand?" and this, too, was a silencing answer. The captain of an American vessel, lying in that harbor, homeward-bound, had called on them that morning, to tender his services and sympathies to the shipwrecked people. To this man, who was a gentle- man, Philip disclosed a portion of the truth, and de- manded his assistance in the meeting which was to fol- low. Captain Rogers accepted the delicate trust, with- out any display of curiosity, and set about discharging his commission with sturdy taciturnity. In the afternoon, Reginald learned from Mr. Gifford the appointed time and place-a little elevated plateau, to the east of the village, flanked by a wood to the north, and falling, on the south, abruptly down to a bay, which stretched away a league or two into the country. He promised to Mabel, that he would come in the morning, and remain with her until the affair should be complete. All day, Philip sat writing in the little room alone; but at night he came and sat with Mabel, while she gazed on his quiet face, and held his hand in her own; thinking the while, that to-morrow the face might be cold, and the hand forever still. She was tearless, and only at intervals murmured his name. Later, Philip fell wearily away into a careless sleep;   THE HEART OF 31ABEL WARE.       319 while Mabel, sitting on the couch by his side, bent over him all night, watching his face until the darkness grew dense; and then watching where his face should be, un- til the misty dawn of the morning came, revealing the features again, pallid and gray and quiet. Presently thereafter she heard the roll of wheels. A carriage stopped at the door of the inn where they lodged. Captain Rogers had come for his principal. With her own hand, and with her caressing voice, she must rouse him to go forth and pay-with his life it may be-the penalty of their mutual joy and guilt. But who doubts that she too, is paying a dearer price- she who must stay behind? The farewell was of the briefest; hardlyany words. Philip handed to Mabel a sealed package--the papers written the day before-and was gone. These papers?-they are here too, on the table where I write, with the journal-book and the port-folio. I deem it fitting to suffer them to remain mute. Suffice it to be said,'that in writing them, Sutherland was oppressed with a presentiment that he was about to die. To Ma- bel, for whom alone they were intended, they possessed a meaning and significance which another eye would vainly seek through them.  Afterwards-months after- wards-when sh3 broke the seal, they accomplished their mission.  Let them rest! Yet, if any readers are curious, these, as well as the book and the other papers, shall be at their service.     320  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. Philip was gone. Mabel heard his carriage-wheels until the sound ceased. It was well that Reginald came then. From an upper window of the cabaret-for this wretched inn was hardly more-where they at once re paired, the surface of this plateau de morte-the place of the hostile meeting-was visible. With a sea-glass they were able to note every thing distinctly. Eugene's carriage was already there. They saw him with Mr. Gifford, walking up and down the place with a slow step. Near him they saw a surgeon, with a package under his arm. They could note Philip's ar- rival: the grim salutation of the parties; and then in stony silence, they watched the progress of the terrible duel to the end.   Hates are heavie though hands be light; Ye fellest wounds dealt, are not in sight. Lawe gives succor for body and purse, But Lawe assoils not a deeper curse. Stains of honor and flawes of heart, Foulest of dye are hopeless to part. Some say that for these y cure is blood; And I believe, o' my soul, sometimes 'tis good.     r"   XXVII. %adr 6g Hattie A GREAT wit has recognized some of the general weaknesses of human estimates, in his well-known say- ing, that "no man ever doubts his own ability to do three things, namely, to drive a gig, to edit a newspaper, and to farm  a small property."' The reverend jester might have added a fourth to his list of universal ac- complishments, unless some one shall be able to remem- ber when, or where, any man declined to second a friend's duel, simply because he considered himself un- qualified. Often, men are ready with excuses. They fear the consequences, they shrink from the painful du- ties, they tremble lest they themselves shall be involved in peril, they hesitate to link their names with the affair, or with the names of the other parties, they are conscientiously opposed to duelling, and will not coun- tenance the system by their co-operation; but amidst the infinite variety of reasons, given by so many un- willing people, I positively believe no one of them was     324   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. ever heard to give this most natural and effective reason in life-namely, ignorance of the management of the affair. Nay, I am convinced, by curious inquiry, that every man verily believes himself infinitely competent to act in that capacity at any time on an hour's notice, and to judge without difficulty all questions of rights or of chances which may be presented for an instantane- ous decision-to take into inexperienced, and frequent- ly agitated hands, the conduct of an affair which in- volves in its issues, so precious a thing as the life of a friend. Every honest and good man must rejoice that the barbarous practice of resorting to the field, for the ad- justment of unimportant differences resulting from dis- regarded punctilios of etiquette, and the costly and dreadful custom of making the deadly encounter the end of feuds and the arbiter of high quarrels-every good and honest man, I say, must rejoice that these customs, and the frightful disregard of human life en- gendered by its frequent sacrifice, have passed like other barbarous customs--some other, I mean, only some-out of date. One feels quite ready to forgive the fanaticism of the reformers who, say that all duel- ling is absolutely murder, and should not any more than assassination, have a recognized existence or tol- eration in any body politic. This warm rushing to the extreme is quite natural after we have been ruled by the other and bloody extreme so long.   THEE  BEART OF  MABEL TWARE.    825 At the same time, wise men know well, though they are well content to refrain from avowing the sentiment that no great system of retributive justice, springing up in the dimmest mists of primal and barbarous life, growing with the growth of the social institution, and strengthening with its strength, taking form and sys- tem and science with civilization, living through all times and  reaching through all nations, in spite of legislative barriers, and in defiance of judicial severity, rushed to spontaneously by cruelly injured men, and grasped like a God-given weapon, in the last resort, by sufferers who have tried all other resources in vain- wise men, I say, know well, that a system like this- nature's first judicial tribunal, the wager by battle-is not wholly unreasonable, is not wholly outrageous, is not wholly without utility. They know, that it should have its place, its hour, its grim but stately appoint- ments, and its recognized existence somewhere in the social fabric; and if not in the letter of the statute-books then, at least in the hearts of men who can feel for deadliest wrongs.. And they know too, that in men's hearts, the wager by battle will always hold its sacred place. Feeling this, and knowing how dangerous an in- strlment of  justice it is, they are not alarmed to know that legislative enactments inhibit it. It is all well. There are vices, of a nature so limited to the men whose they are, that the members of the community     326  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. can not have any other than a curious, an impertinent, a fictitious interest in them. They are not subjects of legislation, nor of judicial notice. They must be left. So, there is commerce between man and man, so strictly mutual, so exclusively dual, in its character and conse- quences, that only the two who deal with each other can properly have to do with it; and the community have no right to any demonstrative intervention. Loves and kindnesses, benefactions of great note and value, may pass between these two; but the outside world shall never know of them. Society shall not officially take note of them. Indeed judicial strictness must not find, in all these, infinite motives, it may be-any re- cognizable motive for any formal act. So may hates exist, between these two alone, and great injuries be wrought that crush the heart without draining the blood, and make the brain mad without marring the body-such hurts may be bestowed in the same exclu- sive manner. These can never be the legitimate sub- jects of laws. Mark now!-A rich man, brave of bearing, gay of speech, and hollow of heart, shall approach a poor man's house, a dark ill conditioned house, poorly ap- pointed, and wretched, but bright to his eyes and warm to his heart who calls it home, for the presence of a daughter. She is fair and good and kind, the poor man's only wealth. The rich man has rested himself   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       827 and gone, but he has stolen a jewel from the poor man's casket. He has seduced his daughter, and shamed the house forevermore. She who was fair is foul; she who was good is wicked; she who was kind is hard- and the home becomes as poor and dark to the poor man's eyes, as it is in reality; nay, a thousand times more wretched. Then what justice shall the sufferer have? absolutely none! If indeed, the case be aggra. vated by some wholly accidental circumstances, and the requisite proof appear, the seducer shall be con- fined in prison for a few months. But who says that is satisfaction? Who thinks that is justice? Some will say, " wait,-wait, there is another world beyond this verily, he shall have his reward ;--but I apprehend the poor man will answer, a Let me kill him now,-and if it be too much, why then let the other world executioners 'bate so much from the punishment reserved for him there!" But let us return from this wide digression-a di- gression into which I have wandered inadvertently. AMy intention was, to adhere severely to the natural flow of the narrative-rushing forward with it in its rapids, and abiding serenely in its still places; happy, if I  should be able to catch and fling back the gleams of sunshine--ah, how few-playing here and there upon its surface, and successful, if in any just degree, I should convey the melancholy refrain of its minor     328  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. keyed murmurs-the tragic sweep and cadences of its latter progress and close. For this first note-worthy ramble, let me be pardoned. The combatants who met this morning, were both supported by men, who had trodden such ground be- fore; and who fell to work with calm expedition, to discharge the formalities of the occasion, and make a quick dispatch of an unpleasant affair. As Philip and his second set foot to the ground, they were received, by Eugene with a haughty inclination of the head, which comprehended both; and by Mr. Gifford with a formal bow to Sutherland, and a proffered hand to Captain Rogers. The two seconds, drawing a little apart--while Eugene still paced up and down the place, with his eyes bent on the ground, and while Philip, who had lighted a segar in the carriage and was smoking, sauntered quietly to the edge of the little plateau which beetled over the bay, thence surveying the beauties of the glorious morning--completed, with a little close conversation, and a little walking hither and thither, and a little glancing about, on the ground and to the back-grounds, the necessary arrangements. Mabel and Reginald, from the little window, were watching and noting all.   There is more of grislie grace, And stateliness in that lone place, Where two deadly-hating foes, Arm to arm to ye death oppose- Imprecating for the right, God to supervise the fight; Than where armies chaffer hard And long, like Jews in a market-place- Fight all day for-lowe reward, Of wealthy place, or filthy praise. But however foes appeal, Ere they close, "God guard the right,' Many issues sad, reveal, Chance alone directs the fight.       XXVIII. IT was agreed that Gifford should measure the ground while Captain Rogers should charge the pistols, and that Gifford should select his weapon from the two, while the captain should have his choice of positions. Each commenced that portion-of the task assigned him. The ground was selected and measured; the pistols were ready, and Gifford had unhesitatingly taken that on which his hand had fallen first. Captain Rogers was looking at the ground. He walked twice or thrice up and down the distance, carefully noticing the features of the place. - Making Gifford confront him, he planted himself, first in one position and then in the other, turn- ing suddenly, levelling out his arm at Gifford's motion- less form, and noting with a lightning glance, the va- rious objects which filled his eye's range. All at once, with a confidence which excited the other's suspicion, leading Philip to one of the places, he stationed him and signified his readiness. Before placing his man,     332  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. Gifford, approaching the other party and glancing about him, saw in a moment the error he had made. Behind Philip, at a little distance, was an arm of the wood, presenting a back-ground filled with the black trunks of trees, and their uncertain branches; while behind his own principal, the ground, level a little way, descended abruptly, and away in the distance were the light waters of the bay, and the white grain-fields of the opposite land. Against these Eugene must stand out in bold relief. Both were stationed; but before the weapons were placed in their hands, 1Mr. Gifford found time for a hur- ried conversation with Captain Rogers. He freely ad- mitted his fault, nor did the other affect to be ignorant of the inequality. "But," said he, "much as I regret it, I must not lose the advantage. The interest of my principal is confided to my care; and however willingly I would enable you to correct the indiscretion, I can not do it without hazarding a life which is not my own. I have no right to do it. All rules of duelling forbid me. But, see," he continued; "yonder is a barge mov- ing slowly across the bay. Possibly her masts and spars swaying hither and thither, may back your man at the proper time, and if so, it will make the chances more nearly equal." It was useless to remonstrate. The weapons were delivered, and the combatants, set with their faces from   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       833 each other, were instructed to turn and fire at the word. Suddenly, Philip, rousing himself from the abstracted mood into which he had fallen, turned and anxiously surveyed the place and its qualities. He was instructed in the customs of the duel, and detected at once the ad- vantage of his position. Speaking out warmly, he pro. posed a change of place. To this Captain Rogers gravely dissented.  Eugene laughed; and even Mr. Gifford, anxious as he had been to be permitted to rec- tify his blunder, was constrained to decline the proffer. Philip, thus opposed, suggested that they leave their places and draw lots; he who should draw the highest number to have the position backed by trees. There was, as before, a general dissent. But Philip refused to fight on other terms, and this method was finally adopted. Placed again, with Sutherland this time backed by the bright water and the white grain-fields, for Eugene had out-drawn  him, the word was given.  The two turned quick and fired. Philip into the air; Eugene's ball shattered his opponent's pistol-hand. The idle hand went heavily down to his side; the pistol fell to the ground, and Philip's face, in spite of his self-con- trol, grew white with the agony of the wound. The mangled hand was slung in a handkerchief, and again the fighters received their weapons. No one spoke yet of satisfaction. 15*     834  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. Again Philip's shot went into the air. Eugene's passed without effect. Captain Rogers perceiving the paleness of his principal, hinted at making an end of it. Gifford declined to mention the matter to Eugene, who heard the proposition, however, and laughed aloud to scout it. They fire again-Philip into the air as before. This time Eugene's bullet went crushing and whirling with ghastly precision through his opponent's body. He staggered back, and was caught in the arms of his second; but recovering himself in a moment, with a sublime effort of courage stood upon his feet, white and gloomy, but resolute. Mr. Gifford now expressed his wish that the affair might end; but Eugene, still laughing brutally, de- manded another shot. Captain Rogers in vain pro- tested against it as outrageous and unheard of. Suther- land, without speaking-he could hardly do that now- signified by a gesture, his intention to gratify his opponent's demand. This time Eugene's shot was harmless. Philip did not fire. "It ends here 1" cried Captain Rogers. "By all means!" assented Gifford. "By the eternal, not so 1" shouted Eugene, in a fury. He strode up and down the place deaf to all remon- strances. He vowed it should only end when one of   THE  HEART OF MABEL WARE.      335 them should be dead. "It was not for an empty shot or two, a pitiful wound," that he came upon the field. "Life-no less than that," would he take. "Death- no less than that," would make him yield. IF   Both seconds vehemently protested against this bar- barous persistency. Both finally withdrew, firmly de- claring that they would not assist at another fire; but Eugene instantly commenced re-loading his pistol him- self, and defied Sutherland to a last encounter. Captain Rogers would have led his principal away; but he had not noted the change which had come upon the features of the wounded man. The blood re- V    turned to his face. By a gesture, gracious but irresist. ible, he dismissed his attendant from his side. Then, speaking with low voice and difficult utterance, yet with IF  something of the old firmness and meaningness of tone, i  he said:- f   "("Be it as you will, Eugene Barbeyrac You shall I    have this last shot I threw my bullet first into the air, and turned full front to your fire, because I had 1 wronged you, and you had a right to revenge. Again, though wounded, I left you unharmed, and faced your shot, because I remembered that your child would be fatherless, and other hearts would be desolate if yours should be cold; and for your childs sake and their's- whom I have wronged too-I did not kill you. It was the third time. I remembered that Mabel was once     HEART OF MABEL WARE. tours; that you, in your feeble way, had loved her; and o, remembering that she is now mine, I pitied you and yet you live. For Mabel's sake, I took your bullet in my breast 1 Still you were not satisfied. Another fire was be- yond the rules. You were not entitled to it, but you would have it.

I took your fire. "And now-you will still murder me! Go on, if you will! It is as well to make here an end of all l I see, nothing less will satisfy you! If we go hence, you will pursue me with assassination. " Stand back, gentlemen! It is no longer a duel. Stand back; my pistol is loaded! Stand away, I say 1" for, here the seconds would have interfered, " From us, I say. He shall have-his last shot for I too, am about to fire  "Give you the word, sir, and then-pray, for pres- ently you will be dead I" The two stood confronting each other with weapons presented. Philip's face was flushed, and his eye fired with the excitement of the occasion. Eugene was pur-   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.   337   ple with passion; foam was at his mouth; he tottered where he stood, and seemed falling in a fit. At once, however, he assumed a sudden rigidity. Counting-one-two-and three, he fired. His ball struck Philip's forehead, but passed off with a harm- less, grazing wound. Philip, slowly, with his left hand, drew his pistol to its level, took patient aim, while all stood aghast, Eugene glaring hatefully on the while, and touched the spring. The ball went through the. hating heart, and the injured husband fell dead I Philip too, sustaining himself with unnatural strength all the time, sank down and was borne away. But Mabel and Reginald had seen all this.       It is not true, what ye praters holde, That death is better than life; Or, if it be true, it is but for the old, -Who are beaten out -with strife. For man in his prime of life to die- Black shade in the place of sweet light- Is as if ye daye while the noon is high, Should falle into sudden night; And who of ye praters will dare maintain, That night untimelie at noon were gain I Oh I the sea is wide, and wide, and wide, And it gladdens the hearts that are gay; But it crushes the broken, it tests the tried, And it scoffs when a weeper would pray; It will laugh with a heart that is blithe of cheer; But it mocks a crushed heart with cruellest jeer.       Ii       PPART FIFTH. XXIX. ItIf jt-Scat' at $e. IT became an immediate necessity with the friends of the wounded man, to bear him at once beyond the reach of the offended laws of the place; which were stern and exact against duellists, and which, in a case like this, would doubtless be executed rigidly. The means of safety were at hand. It will be remembered that Captain Rogers had announced himself as homeward bound. His vessel was in readiness; he also, was one of those who must fly; nor was his departure hastened by many hours, when, yet early in the morning, before the unaccus- tomed officials of that little village had taken any steps toward the arrest of the offenders, they sailed quietly out of the mouth of the harbor, quietly down the reach     342  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. of shoreward-going waves, and quietly out until the fatal shore was lost in the foam-crests behind them; with Philip slung in a hammock, with Mabel at hand to watch and nurse him, and with Reginald, who could not do otherwise than share their flight, walking the deck-his heart almost breaking with contending emo- tions of love and of regret, of pity and of indignation. There was a poor unskilful surgeon on the ship, who made a knavish piece of work of setting Philip's wounds to rights; and who, considering, with much wonder, that his patient had not been killed outright, and mark- ing the vigorous cast of his frame and the fresh look of his countenance, ventured at once to pronounce his case one of slight importance; one from which he would be quite healed before they should reach the other side. All who saw the place where the bullet had entered, and noted how it must have gone through the lungs, could but feel sad and doubtful, and shook their heads at the little wise man's prediction, yet allowed them- selves to be beguiled into the hope that all might be well. The surgeon was stupidly ignorant, and there- fore quite confident in his own conviction. Accord- ingly he declared the hand-wound to be the more dan- gerous of the two, and set himself directly to probing, setting, splintering, splicing and bandaging in a man- ner to drive his victim almost mad with the pain of it. Oh, sweet was the wind that reached them now. It   THE  HEART OF MABEL WARE.      343 came without rudeness and without noise, but brought along with it a balmy odor, even upon the waters, that hinted of meadows and river-banks and of spring-flow- ers. It was the gentlest air that ever blew, that which came reaching after them to heal their wounded hearts and refresh their chafed bodies. It came, now with light clouds, now with quick-hushed rains, and now with clear blue sky above, and they sped them on their way. But, alas, it was different, after a day or two. Philip had now taken the inflammation. The wasting fever and agony set in, and combined at times to drive him delirious. O'nights, lying in his hammock, -in the close cabin, with the fire in his breast to torture him, he raved. He raved his whole life out to Mabel-all that he had been, all that he had looked for, all that he had feared. At such hours, too, came remorse. Eugene would be there-a pale ghost, to cry out after him for a murderer, nor ever cease to upbraid him with treachery. At such times, the wild man would turn with fury upon his gentlest and most patient nurse; reproaching her with bitterest taunts and charging her with his undoing, until she too had well-nigh gone mad. O' days, when the fever had subsided a little in his  : breast, he would lie--his hammock swung by day be- tween decks, in the air-watching with eager and wide-  :' *I     844   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. eyed gaze all slightest objects about him. Long would he look into each man's face, as if wistful to note some expression there; but the same anxious look would fol- low the billows and the clouds, and the white gulls as well. His face had now grown thin and sharp. His eyes were large and lustrous. Of an afternoon, a red mark was blushing in either sunken cheek-but oh, how shall a poor pen like this, describe in written words-how, even, should a master's hand leave on canvass-the look of fearful mingled languor and earnestness, which this dying man's features wore? For, be-sure, this man must die, now. Again the air grew rich with odors that hinted of grasses and of blooms, but these were borne now from the west. Birds too, flying eastward with weary wings, came down to rest in their shrouds; and the tender sail- ors welcomed them, for they knew by their coming that the voyage was almost complete. Another voyage too, was now almost complete, and it was doubtful which harbor should be first entered. Now the sick man did not rave any more o' nights. His looks, full of tender love, but full also of the deep languor and disquietude, never ceased to follow Mabel, with benedictions of glance. She went not from him now, day or night. She was pale as he, but her eyes were tearless. She was mute, and watchful, and patient   THE HEART   OF MABEL WARE.     845 If there were any clamorous griefs in her heart, raging to be given out in quick cries, she repressed them. Reginald, won from all unkindness of thought, now, by this great calamity, stood, too, at the other side of the hammock by night and by day. The sailors and their officers, hushed and reverent, went about with a certain important air like men hav- ing a grave mission. The winds and the waters, too, went hither and thither as if commissioned to break no silence by any token or noise, for, allthe voyage, never "did ruder air perplex their sliding keel," than the soft breezes that came, first eastward and then westward, laden now with the odors of the old, and now with the fragrances of the new world. Philip grew feebler. Mabel was more still. Regi- nald became kinder and gentler in his offices. The sailors, and the winds, and the waters felt quieter in their comings and goings. Then, all of a quietest afternoon, as he lay on the still deck, while only the playing prow-ripple and the murmur of the stern billows made a hushing noise, he spoke. The fever had left him now. He was all calm, and clear of brain, and possessed of heart. He spoke words of wailing without weakness; words , of shrinking without fear, and words of protest without a braggart air. I will not write here what he said. My heart is filled     346  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. with the burden of the protest and the wail; but I will not write the words. Whatever a man so young and so confident, knowing all the worth and worthlessness of life, loving and be- loved, hoping with daring aspirations for happiness and for fame, for length of days and honor, curious to test the future with the ever fresh experience of the past, not fearing to die, but having crowding plans of long life, and unwilling to relinquish them-what such a man might feel he felt, and said what such a man at such an hour might say. A cry of grief is on the waters. Agony of heart is in the little vessel that goes on its lonely way. The sun, going down now, penetrates between the decks and leaves a halo of lurid light around the dead man's head and his thick masses of dark hair. The sailors have come to look, and have gone to be still all night. Reginald is gone too, to weep alone; and Mabel, still bends over her dead. She clasps that head which gives no sign. She seizes and drops the cold hands. She presses her ear long and earnestly to his breast, but there is no stir of heart. She looks out this way, out that way, over the waters, with quick, desperate and never satisfied glances, as for something which she can no more find. She sobs with tearless eyes, without relief; and still seeks with caresses to awaken respon- sive caresses which will waken nevermore.   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       347 Oh, well, for the clouds that float in the happy sky; and well, for the waves that go, crested and brave, here and there! Oh well, for the onw'ard-pressing ship, so soon to cut with her prow the waters of her home-bay 1 and well for the gentle-hearted sailors who are almost home, where wife, or child, or parent, or sister-or some one-awaits each.

BEFORE Reginald and Mabel left the ship the next morning, an undertaker, coming with a brazen box, of shape significant enough to satisfy all curious gazers, carved, too, with devices and symbols of mourning- urns and the like-had borne away with him the body. Then they sped them home, without pause, without rest; but Mabel never took her thoughts away from following that brazen box-with its lid and sides wrought into mournful hints-on its lonely journey. And at night; when they had reached home, she fell into an unquiet sleep; and dreamed a dream of the traveller so cribbed. The dream ran thuswise: She saw the undertaker bear the burden from the vessel, along wharfs burdened with worlds of freight, none of it so costly, alas, as this; along narrow streets 4 where heedless life jostles unheeding death; and along by great hotels, where this same still form had moved so familiarly once, to his ware-rooms. There, with piles     352   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. of coffins on this side, with ranges of coffins on that side, with sables and palls hanging here and there, the assistants completed their preparations. Thence, the symbolled box, marked with another symbol, not of death but of destination, was taken and delivered to the transportation people. Then the dreamer saw, as it was placed with other freightage in a baggage-car,-and, glancing back a little, there were hundreds of living men, each with his busi- ness and his desires; but what were these to her? There Dwere infants in their mother's arms, and children. with their nurses,--happy all. There were boys going to college, and girls coming home from schools, merry all. There were gay men and beautiful women, on di- vers errands-trifling all. There was a wife, and her lover-not her husband, alas!--tremulous both. There were mothers going home-hopeful all. There were fathers going after money, for those at home, brave and resolute all. But what were these to her? There, in the dark carriage, with the other freightage and by the brazen box, her soul sat down. There was a desperate crash. The foremost carriages were broken in pieces. There were cries, and groans Tlose who were behind, coming forward, saw here and saw there many mangled bodies of men and women and children; and, wailing aloud, they pushed away the unbroken brazen box, and said within themselves:-   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       853    I "alas, why did this escape, and these encounter the  shok which this would have been safe from?"     - The dreamer awoke!                  Z Late in the second day, a wagoner delivered the box  at their door. The people of the place knew of their  return; and, looked with suspicion upon all that hap -: pened. Cyrus Todd too, mindful of the laugh of Ma-  bel's, that night, when she " went to town with Eugene's cousin," and seeing the direction on the coffin, as he  ferried it across the river, suspected the whole, and at once the little village knew all.            q To avoid the public gaze, perhaps fearful of encoun- tering a demonstration of public disapproval, it was de- termined that Philip should be buried secretly. That night therefore, late, "almost at odds with morning" indeed, Reginald and Mabel, each holding a  torch--while two strong serving-men lowered the body into a new grave in the little lonely burial-place-saw the last of the brazen-box. Holding forth their torches, and peering downward, the flare of the light, falling on the salient curves and lines, relieved the black dark'  ness with reflected curves and lines, which however,  fell everywhere into appalling symbols of death, upon the coffin-lid. So, shuddering both, they drew back; - and the serving men, while they held their torches up above their heads to see, filled the grave to the surface. It was a wild and strange way to be buried, thus in ai     354  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. the dead night; lowered into a rude grave, out of torch- light, like a brigand. The only midnight burial I ever saw, was one of unrelieved ghastliness. It was a strange and wild end of a life like Suther- land's.

Whole cities fled for breath : from the fatal South to the rivered North: and in the North too, the crowded streets of towns grew strange   and still at noonday, while the feet that were used to ' press them, went pressing banks of tender grass; and    while the white faces that were used to flit and glim- i mer in them, grew bronzed and joyous--fanned by    i ocean-winds, and tanned by hot beach-sands. Summer heats too came to the Wold, and the borough-  dwellers grew wan, and panted for mountain air; but  where might Mabel fly? When she went now down the paths her feet were wont to tread, she walked reso- lutely on, nor tarried in any pleasant shade; but, reach-  ing the walk's end, presently returned. She went too, without looking up, without looking down. If she gazed away, her glance, like her feet, went straightly -! forth, and straightly returned. Her step was no more  , -16 . '.1 ,*,/i     358   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. elastic. No hue but one was in her face. Her eyes were cold and expressionless--only weary. Sometimes in the morning, thinking of the dreariness of the day that menaced her with its long hours, she grew impatient and desperate. Then calling her fleet steed, she rode furiously forth for an hour, through the thickest dust and most unshadowed part of the high- way. But returning, she seemed unchanged. Sometimes in these rides she passed the people of the place, but always she swept by them like a storm, nor ever stopped to note whether scorn or hate, or wonder or pity met her in their startled faces. Often she saw the gay people flying from town to country retreats; and then she shuddered to feel that for her there was "nor flying hence, nor tarrying here." At first Reginald accompanied her rides, going with womanly tenderness to be with her lest she might have to breast alone some smiting look or word of scorn. But, seeing her ride apparently regardless of his pres- ence, and heedless of passers by, he went no more and she rode at her will. He watched with tenderest soli- citude her wanness of cheek, her failing fleetness of step, and her coldness of eye. Long and gently, and deftly too, he sought to win her back to thoughts of life, to hope, to curiosity, even to wild grief; any thing   THE  HEART   OF MABEL   WARE.    859      but silence: yet, seeing all his efforts fail, he felt them   : all. absurd, and was fain to leave her alone. One part of the house was now unused. Here, in       ?! the darkened rooms, sometimes the weary woman went; and there for days together she would remain, stealing     ? in and out of all the doors, and remaining never one      X hour in any apartment. All day, the haunting spectres  of other days drove her from room to room. All day, the phantoms followed her with mocking, staring eyes -with cruel, jeering eyes.- "Old faces glimmered at the doors,         3 Old footsteps trod the upper-floors,    - Old voices called her from without ;"  - but still like Mariana in " the moated grange," she only    ? said,  "s I am a-weary, a-weary, I would that I were dead."             From heat to heat the summer went on. The pesti- lence came to the village, and even to the tenant-houses at the Wold. Reginald would have urged her to fly, but she would not listen--she heard him   not. She only heard, but steadfastly heard, the frightful boding words-the fearful meaning words, "There is nor flying hence, nor tarrying here." Fiercer heats withered the air. Drought withered , ' i     360   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. the herbage. Unshadowed skies scorched the earth. The fell disease struck down the strong men, struck down the fair-browed women, withered away the ten- der children. -Mabel went to the tenant-houses, and looked mutely on, until the dying should be dead. Never laid she cool hand on'a burning brow, never bathed- a parched mouth, never rendered the soothing offices of tenderness and patience. But wherever the dying were, there she stood with her dry eyes and sealed lips.' Why should she minister to these people -so happy? How she envied each calm corpse! But the pestilence had no harms for her. And still the summer went on from heat to heat. Mists came and filled the air. Dry mists, red and tremulous, overhung the earth; but they warded away no glare of sunshine, and the air grew heavier with the weight. Reginald's Peak and the hills became every day fainter of outline, and then were lost. A little later, the river--so low in its bed that no craft could swim, and the ferry was a gentle ford-disappeared from sight. Then the trees, first far down the fields, and afterwards nearer the "Heights," one by one went out in the mist, like a light obscured in some dark dis- tance; but this was not much to be deprecated, for their leafy honors had long before grown sere. Nearer and nearer about them closed their cheating shroud. Heavier grew the murky air.   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       361 Later, the summer strained to fullest bend, seemed to relax. A copious rain left the earth rejoicing, and the air soft arid bland. But how could the heat of Ma- .  bel's heart be quenched? What shower could allay her fever? What consolation might lend its bland     . serenity to the hot atmosphere of self-consciousness? With tearless, aching eyes-with unrefreshed face, and with lips still mute, she loooked out now upon : rains, now upon sunshine, now upon chilly vapors of autumn; but her heart was still bent. There was only one relaxation now. *    .   #        X    *  .  . : What purifying influences these summer-heats have  for a heart so diseased, who can tell?

"So nearly make clean"--for, be the truth spoken, oh sore, oh sad!-no purifying min- ister can ever wholly eradicate a blot once fallen on so white a thing as a woman's soul. Drear glooms had gathered over her path, when she had found herself yoked in a. hateful alliance; yet she 3 had borne herself through all with stubborn silence.  :::*i     362   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. Fate, whatever lessons of mere endurance he had taught her, had no teachings like those of shame and remorse, and lonely grief. I do not know how it was, but when the cool and pleasant time of autumn came, she began to wander down the paths, to haunt the woods again, to ramble over the fields, and to ride here and there, as of old. She was pale still, and mostly silent; but now she plucked flowers, and looked at children again.   In the heart of bowed age, Light balms sorest griefs assuage. Kindlie seemings, look or word, Comfort lende; while griefs deferred, For the time less grave appear; And the dotard wins good cheer.

WHEN Reginald bore the desperately hurt man and the pale woman, away from the coast of France, in flight, back toward the land whence the two vigorous and joyous had come,-it will be remembered, they had  just left Eugene lying dead, pistol in hand, with his friend bending over him, trying in vain to stroke out of the rigid features the ghastly look of hate which yet re- mained on them,--and with the surgeon standing by unneeded. The authorities of the place caused the young gen- tleman to be arrested, as a party to the bloody act; but when they learned that the man whose dead corpse only was in their custody, had come in long pursuit of a faithless wife and a treacherous friend, and that the same hand which first robbed him of his jewel of hap- piness, had now ravished from him his poorer jewel of life, they made easy the penalties of their offended law, 3 and Mr. Gifford was presently set at liberty and allowed  to bear the body of the slain husband away. i z- 1     366  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. Intelligence to be transmitted, advices to be ex- changed and preparations to be made, so delayed the homeward voyage, that it was not until the summer had almost passed, that Eugene's remains reached their destination. The old Grandam, meeting the vessel with outcries of paraded grief and ostentatious display of funeral cir- cumstance, bore the tardy coffin down the country, to the desolate home, accompanied by a retinue of old family friends; and seeming to have some consolation in making all beholders feel how great a wrong she had endured-how great an outrage had been com- mitted upon a family so innocent. Accordingly, that day when the black draped cortege went through the country towns-all the people heard querulous com- plaints of treachery-the basest and most terrible mur- der done upon an injured man in a foreign land. A story was told also, partly true but only dealing in facts and not considering motives, concerning a ship- wreck; and it was said, while all listeners stood aghast with horror, that only the day before the murder had been perpetrated, its victim had gone out through hide- ous breakers to the doomed ship, and at his own most imminent peril had generously saved the life of the man who within a day was to shed his blood. The country-side rang with the vehement indigna- tion of the people. The murmur came soothingly to   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.        367 the ears of the lone and stricken old gentlewoman, and she bade the train move slowly, in order to prolong the sense of consoling sympathy. In the open carriage with herself and the clergyman--she had always been a churchwoman--sat the little girl whose father was borne in the plumed and palled hearse before. It seemed to be almost a pleasure to the old lady, as they passed through the frequent villages with slow pace, while the people came round to stare at them, and the principal families sent their carriages to join the pro- cession,-it seemed a pleasure, in some sort, to the bereaved old lady to take the little girl into her lap, and caress her with an air as of necessary support and protection. They came with pageant of grief and pomp of sol- emnity down to the quiet country place. Little used as a people so rural were to an excitement so great, and unaccustomed too, from their religious tenets to see the dead bestowed by other ceremonials than of the plainest, they gathered around with calm surprise to look on and swell the throng. Others, however, and many, came with real sorrow to exhibit so poor a mark of respect for one who in his life had been known and loved by them. For Eugene had been a warm-hearted and pleasant-mannered man, and had not failed to make friends anywhere-except at home. The village graveyard therefore, where he was to lie,     368  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. where his father had been buried before him-where Philip Sutherland too, the spring before, without pomp and with only Mabel to mourn and Reginald to behold, in the night too, had been lowered out of the torchght into the darkness-was now crowded with a greater multitude of feet, than ever before had crushed its flowers. Philip's grave had remained all summer without any tablet to mark the place, only a myrtle--that too planted in the night-had sprung up and began to look green and dark upon the spot. But, though unmarked ex- cept by the myrtle, the people of the place knew the grave; and if withering, reproachful glances and scorn- ful, hateful looks could have wrought upon the flowery earth, that spot would have worn a grim dent for long and long. The priest stood there in his robes, where robed priest had never stood before; for there the simple in- habitants, though living so near to cities and churches, had another and quieter way than we have, of hiding the faces of their dead. Even Eugene's father, who had not been by birthright a member of the peaceful brotherhood, had been so enamored of this funereal sim- plicity, as to direct himself to be so quietly buried. Then the august and beautiful ritual went floating the air, so solemnly and compellingly that even the gray-clad people of the place, and the oldest and most   THE tHEART OF MABEL WARE.      369 stubborn of them all, grew breathless still to hear; and each carefully pulled his obstinate hat to one side of his head. Then the sound that comes up from every grave that men build, after whatever ceremony-the sound of the falling clods on the coffln's lid-came up on the air yet freighted with the other and gentler sound, and the two intermingled, and were borne away. But just as the ceremonial was complete, when those who had stood in the skirts of the crowd were strolling mutely away, and when those who had been nearest the open grave were parting and falling back, leaving the priest, the bent but still stately lady and the father- less child standing close by the grave alone; just then a cloud of dust, swiftly moving down the highway and drawing near the place, attracted the watch of the people. As it came -nearer they heard the quick falling of the horse's feet; and they could now see Mabel's form in its centre, as the dust-cloud approached. The highway ran close by the graveyard; the place was narrow, and the passers-by must go near the graves., Already the people, now retiring, blocked the road; so that Mabel was forced to draw rein, and let her horse walk slowly through the crowd. Ah, what evil looks met her, from all the upturned eyes I Detached from the neighborhood by their seclusion, no rumor of the arrival of Eugene's body had reached     370  THE HEART OF BTA BEL WARE. the Wares.  Mabel was therefore ignorant what fu- neral this was; but suddenly, she could be ignorant no longer. Casting her confused glance away to the left, she saw the men filling a grave; and standing thereby, was the robed priest, and the little tearful girl-her own child- and the broken yet proud old dame. But the old dame seemed not broken now. She too, at the sound of the horse's feet, had looked up; and carefully wiping her tears away, finally, as the rider drew near could recognize the unhappy woman who was the cause of all. Then all her old stateliness and pride, and for the moment, her strength too came back. Then all woman- ly tenderness died out of her and left her rigid as car- yen marble. Then all her love for her boy, her de- termined conviction that his life had been taken by a cowardly conspiracy, and her hate of the murderers, came and filled her with a rage that was not to be ap- peased. Crying out fiercely to those who stood near, to stay the murderess, she rushed suddenly forward, with her own hands to tear her down from the horse. Many arms were stretched out to restrain her from the phrenzied act, but still she struggled with them all, in her ghastly eagerness to be revenged in brutal physical destruction. No hand stayed Mabel's course; she grew paler as   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       371  the word '( murderess" reached her ear, and pressed on  through the obstructing crowd with shuddering haste, but alas, without speed. She saw the sudden rush     ? toward her, and saw the crazed woman withheld. Still  she strove to pierce the crowd and be let away; and no word came from her lips.        . Finding that she could not be -allowed to reach her victim, the old gentlewoman raised her voice, and sent it out after the pale and mute apparition - bidding her listen to a motherly curse. There was no need of the bidding. The tone of her voice turned all hearers 'to statues still as stone, and compelled their listening.  The groups filling the road remained motionless ;Sand Mabel, begging with entreating looks and imploring gestures but without words, for room, was'forced to re- main and hear. And then, by a chance combination of scene and time and purpose, there occurred a certain inartificial grouping together of circumstance and character, in grim harmony of parts, to complete the unitiesof a pic- ture, grand of scope, sublime of attitude, symmetrical of proportion and tragic in manifest sequences. It was artful without art; complete without care. There, standing with her feet above the graves of  her husband and her son; with the robed priest awed in feature, and lifting his hand in deprecating token at  her side; with the fatherless child weeping and cling-  :?     372  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. ing to her garments-the child's golden-tressed head caressed by her black-gloved left hand-standing there, and reaching out her right arm above the half-filled grave, while the men with mattocks and with spades stood awfully aloof from their work, was the old Gran- dam, her tall form drawn up to fullest stateliness, her features rigid and fierce with long disused tricks of haughtiness, her eyes sparkling, her lips apart, and her nostrils distended with the excitement of the occasion. Alas for the central figure of the other group I To the right of the picture's field, surrounded by the pic- turesqucely clad people of the place, intermingled and relieved of monotony by the sable-wearers-the friends who had come in the funeral cortege-sat Mabel upon her horse. The people around her, wearing always a suf- ficiently grave demeanor, had turned from the grave- place, with faces unusually solemn, and with mien more than ever reverent. Startled at Mabel's ap- proach, and suddenly stopped and rooted in their foot- places by the dreadful clamor of the old gentlwoman, each face was turned backward or upward, and, some leaning this way, and some that, peered eagerly toward lier pale face, to note how such a woman might endure such a curse. Her horse, with a quick intelligence in his eye, with one car prickled eagerly forward, and one drooping low on his neck, stood in a posture of chafing impatience at the detention. It was the same gallant   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       373- horse that used to bear her, in the thrice happy days, or ever the sorrows had come-her gallant Selim. But the woman who now sat upon the unchanged horse, alas, for the change I Her hair seemed darker;  it was ever damp now, and appeared more luxuriant for the recklessness of its disposition. Her brow was-- oh, how pale! Her eyes were hollow and sunken, and bright as a maniac's eyes. Her cheeks, flushed now, but pale ever, were fallen and hollow. Her form, ar- rayed in a close-fitting riding-habit, seemed indeed, un- impaired. One gloved hand held, with nervous finger- play, the bridle-rein, while the other, carrying the whip, was drawn shrinkingly across her breast, and pressed convulsively to her heart. As she rode, she had left the graves on her left, and now, as the first words-'  reached her, she turned with a fearful shrinking away expressed in her attitude, and fixing a startled, an im- ploring, a protesting look upon the curser, she listened without averting the gaze.  "Hearken," shrieked  the Grandam, with vatical    I pomp  of gesture, and with shrillest menace of tone; "Hearken, thou murderess, for the kin of the murdered cry out to thee for blood!

These last words were uttered more shrilly, and with increasing vehemence as Mabel rode swift as a wounded deer away; for now, when the phrenzied woman left off with the guilty mother, and fell to cursing the inno- cent unborn child, the horror of the hearing' startled the statues from their rooted attitudes, and gave room for the suffering woman and the impatient steed. Desperately she struck the  eager, horse, and went with the weird speed of a scared ghost from the place; but swifter, came the last shrill menace and reached her flying, "Be cursed, be cursed, be cursed, thou, and the child thou art round with!"

Yes, for now as the winter came down from the fro- zen north, Mabel was looking for another gift at the hand of Fate. Fate was again teaching her lessons of endurance, and now another, reward was proposed the fee. All that autumn, Mabel sat in the house, looked forth with pensive eyes, and wore out the dreamy beauty of the sky and the earth with her heavy watch- ings. No more, now, no more since that curse had reached her ear and cloven her heart, went she forth as before.  No more dared she ride the roads where all men-and women more than men--who might meet her would know her story and would greet her with scornful looks. No more dared she walk in the fields, the woods, the sequestered paths and lonely lanes where the old haunts had been. For to her these places, no less than the dusty highway, were peopled.     380   THE HEART OF ]KABEL WARE. The phantoms of the old forms and the familiar faces walked beside her there; and whenever they came, inopportunely they met. Then followed in her whirl- ing fancy, fantastic brawls. They died each by the other's hand; and the apparitions too, turned to curse her with evil eyes. All the people about the house now, who had been there long were to be removed. And a few new faces, changing every week, were all that she could bear to see. Mabel dared not step her foot on the ground now, lest the herbage should be blasted. She dared not note any sweet sound, lest she should jangle the har- mony. She dared not gaze on any fair scene, lest she should see a menacing ghost pointing backward and beckoning forward. If she ate food, she waited to die, as if it were poison for her. If she drank water she looked to see it shrink away from her hot lip. She dared not now think sweet or pure thoughts, lest all thoughts should thenceforth for all time grow grisly and besmirched. She checked with haste, any slight- est souvenir of love, lest sweet love too should be slain. Religion, she kept away, crying with her hand on her lips, "Unclean, unclean!" and fearing lest all faith should turn to dark unbelief. She dared not pray, lest some watchful demon should seize her lips and wring out blasphemy unaware. She dared not hope, lest all   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       381' administering angels should become fell agents of retri- bution. So, feeling that whatever air she might breathe would henceforth wander the atmosphere, a tainted contagion; that whatever song her lips might utter, would never more be fit for the lips of the pure; that whatever sweet or happy thought her brain or -heart might dally with, would go forth so distorted and. bent awry that it would never more be wholesome for the imaginations of gentle maidens to harbor, she waited in wonder, to see what monstrous manner of child could be produced from her. A grim sense of the grotesque, too, be it said, sometimes mingled with her disjointed- fancies, and tinged them with a ghastly hue of baleful mirth. The child would seem already born, and her changing whims would make it wear diverse shapes of ugliness and deformity; or sometimes would conceive an unem- bodied and impalpable creation. It might be, now, a sound-as a long wail; now, a laughing imp, gaily prankt in jewels or flowers of hottest flame; now, a frightful laugh, pealing out into blind darkness, and echoing down a long gallery, lost in the distance but leaving the consciousness of a continuous echo jeering and mocking far on; or, it might be some bi-formation; of diverse natures-a white-winged dove, perhaps, with the hateful eyes, the burnished crest, and the lithe neck of some frightfullest snake. Sometimes, it would come 17'      382  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. forth a white bird, which, placed in her hands, but bursting away, would fly swiftly out and upward until it would be lost from sight; while in her hands would be left a golden thread spun out from the flight, and hanging down the sky: and up this slender thread must she, through so long a time as, perhaps, the half of a delirious night, climb, by her hands alone, oh, how wearily; and if she looked down there were the tenants' faces, and the faces of the villagers, and Cyrus Todd's face, and Martha Ruggles' face, all looking up after her with mockery. Sometimes, she had given birth to a new pestilence, which, running around the world and killing whole nations of men and women and children, would bring its victims with horrible glee to its mother's feet, until for ever and ever she seemed to sit upon a throne, which was a mountain hecatomb. Now, Mabel took her bed, and did not rise any more; but her imagination kept on in-its ceaseless whirl, and she never ceased to wonder what it should be, this birth, now almost due. Now, the old midwife, who, in the same chamber had nursed her mother when she was born, came and established herself in the room; and a little later, Dr. Coverley, who had visited the house every day, came and took up his abode there, and she saw him ten times a day--yet Mabel did not cease to wonder. Now, one day, another physician came, and stood   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       383    A: with Dr. Coverley, at her bedside. They spoke to. each other as if she were not present, and as night  came on, there was a preparation in the .room and Mabel wondered more eagerly than before, for she be- lieved that her child would be born that night. And now, indeed, for the first time strange as it may seem, she began to link in her mind the memory of the father, with the thought of the child. She began to see his eyes in the eyes yet unopened, to hear his voice ' in the infant voice yet dumb, and to see his beauty in the beauty yet unbeheld. Now she heard Philip's step in every comer's step. She saw his form in every by- stander's. A score of times she cried out to welcome him, as some one opened the door; and then, disap- pointed, she would tremble with eagerness, to have in  a her arms his child-and her's.              ; So, she waited with a great tempest in her heart. There was a great tempest too, out of doors, that- night. -                ai * ,i :!     9   Like the phantoms of a dream Sorrowe's phantasies do seeme; Subtle modes doth madness ply, From its own conceits to fie.  Whenne the darkest gloom impends- ye self-same houre the sorrowe ends. When the fardels that we bear, Growe too grave, and fell despair Saps our courage, mines our strength,               I Thenne repose draws on at lengthe.  'Bitterest groans at ye last we sigh, But sweet peace and calm are nigh. *         '  A::l     I   I A I XXXIV. AND still the wild wind swept down from the hills, and howled across the Wold. Great blasts came, bear- ing eddies of sleet, and dasled them against the case-  ments with a noise, which, to the ears of the sick woman seemed louder than' the rattle of musketry.  Long shrieks were wrung out from the tortured house- cornices, and each beaten gable seemed to wail like a spirit of the damned. The trees too, like the trees in Dante's Hell, took plaintive voices, told piteous tales to the heedless night, and shrieked with reproachful  fear, as the mad tempest tossed and twisted their long boughs. Ever and ever, sudden gleams of lightning  flashed away from the winter storm, and left blacker darkness on the earth. Sometimes, stronger and fiercer  charges of the storm-legions menaced the very strength : of the old stone mansion, and made the frame of the strong building tremble and creak like the timbers of a  laboring -ship; and then each inmate looked timidly  away to some noisy corner, as if to see it part.      388  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. All these sounds of the tempest reached Mabel's chamber, hitherto so sedulously quiet; and to her, with her brain fevered, and her senses bent to the fiercest tension, they were almost maddening. They had taken the child to another room immedi- ately, while she was unconscious, and before her moth- erly lips had caressed it-to give her quiet; and rest, they said-and no entreaty could induce them to bring it. The physician administered many an opiate and potent narcotic, but "nor poppy nor mandragora, Nor all the drowsy syrups in the world Could medicine" the raving creature to slumber. Occasionally a placid calm would fall on her pale face. Her limbs would lose their rigidity. Her breathing would become regular; but anon some fiercest shriek of the blast would pierce to her heart, and shake her with a thousand wild imaginings. Then she would start up crying back de- fiance to the mad tempest. She would toss aloft her fair arms, and twist them together, and sway them wantonly as the tree-branches were swayed in the wanton gusts. Her eyes would grow wild, and her nostrils dilate with terror. Tow she sang, now she prayed, and now she raved half incoherently, in entreaty, in despair, in choking grief and in fearful menaces, until her voice grew husky, and she could be heard no more.   THE   HEART OF MABEL WARE.     389 As the night wore on toward the morning, she be- came calmer. Her quiet intervals were longer and more certain. The physician left her alone with the old nurse. Soon the pale woman seemed to fall asleep. The nurse, sitting a little apart, listened through the noise of the storm, to catch the breathing of the slum-, berer. A little before she had doubted if sleep could, ever again calm that perturbed form. So, wondering, she too, fell asleep. Mabel awoke. A blighting doubt had seized her. A thought was at her heart, so fearful that it was kill- ing her but to think. She rose noiselessly, warily. The craft of madness shone in her eyes as they gleamed  on the nurse, while she passed her, and reached the door. Through dark rooms and halls she made her] silent way to the parlor. As she entered the room, a sudden flare of lightning showed her a white mantle,  draped over some motionless object, lying on a table., A tremor struck all her limbs. She tore away the cloth, and without daring to reach out her hand, stood waiting for what another flash should reveal. Long     i  she waited in the cold and desolate place, all the while   bending forward, in vain striving to pierce the cruel, darkness. The lightning came. There lay the new-born child,  dead, glowing in the glare like a holy child, and wear- ing, to her excited fancy, on its upturned face the same- *i     390  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. look its father wore that night, when the sun, setting in the billows, reached with its beams and enhaloed his face and his masses of dark hair. Think you the mad woman made any noise? Should she shriek, or wail, or sob, there, and then? Noise, to call around her the cruel haters, who had already taken the life from the helpless babe, and now would slay her? Oh, mad as she was, she was not so mad as that! Quickly she bared her feverous breast. Quickly she snatched the child, stiff and chill, to her motherly bosom, and strove to make the thin garment go round and warm them both. Oh, then you should have seen her, warily gliding through the long hall; shrinking suddenly to the wain- scot in some lightning gleam; swiftly and dexterously undoing the fastening of the double doors; cowering through the narrow opening and making it fast behind her; and then, with the sleeping house all closed and black, walking like a ghost down the piazza, and hurrying by each white window-shutter. The storm beat pitilessly her unprotected frame; Her face, her shoulders, her white breast, the dead child, her arms and wasted hands, were cut by the whirling shower of sleet. All the ground was roughly cncrusted with ice, and the sharp points gored her ten- der feet; but she fled away down the well-known paths   THE HEART OF MABEL W ARE.       391      I of the garden, and out into the long meadows where " the summer warriors conquered; across the grain-fields where the furrowed ground made her trip and fall; through the corn-fields where at every step, her gored feet struck heavily against the rank stubble sheathed in ice, fast she fled. Once she looked back; but the look froze her with a chillier thrill than the wintry air. Her flight had been discovered. She could see the house flashed through by sudden lights. She fancied she could hear Regi- nald's startled call, that should rouse all sleepers, like a trumpet's blare; so she fled faster. She ran towards Reginald's Peak. Fear and mad-     .  ness gave her strength, and she clasped the stiff weight   X to her heart and went on.                   I Sometimes the high fences-each board ice-sheathed, too-barred her way; but they were behind who had killed her' child. Sometimes fierce gusts swept her      1 from her course, and beat her down to her knees; but ever she regained her feet, and fled toward the "Peak." ' Never, until the pallid morning came, did the flaring    I lights cease from fluttering here and there, in and around the shocked house. Some went down the lane, some up the mountain-road, and some down toward the        d turnpike; some through the garden-walks, and some along the path to the thick wood.              " It was white day when one of the searchers found on -        392   THE tIEART OF MABEL WARE. the garden fence, a shred of a white garment of finest fabric, like Mabel's night-dress. Then quickly gathered the others there. Sometimes by the print of her feet, sometimes by stains of blood, sometimes by gouts of flesh frayed and fretted off from her torn feet, and now, sheathed in the ice, and sometimes by some fragment of a white gar- ment, they followed on her traces. Reginald pressed before them all, with impetuous haste, ever losing the trail, now cursing the stupid ser- vants with great oaths, now groaning aloud to see the bloody stains, and now darting away, to follow some sudden conjecture. So the ghastly searchers went, where the ghostly ap- parition, with the stiff childin its arms, had gone before. So they reached across the wide fields, to the foot of the mountain, at the side nearest the river. Then the traces grew plainer. Here the blood-stains and the gouts of flesh were more frequent. They could see where she had sunk down here and there, exhausted; and then, how she had staggered with uneven steps along. They traced the steps into the narrow path winding along the steep declivity above the river. Here were boisterous pools and eddies in the stream, and above them the banks were steep; and the path ran close along the edges. Beyond the most boisterous of the river-pools, they could find no traces.   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.       393 So each man looked at the others and pointed to the pool, and then glanced at the long reach of ice, cover- ing all the river's surface, below. And each one  gravely shook his head. All that morning, the merry ferryman moored his      : barge in that part of the ferry canal, where the current was strongest. Reginald, sitting in a skiff, was rowed backward and forward, through the canal, peering all the morning down into the hopeless, cold flood, but Cyrus Todd. was sure. He knew the currents well, and had moored in the strongest of them. He leaned, with boat-hook in hand, over the upper side of his . barge, peering downward. Many wagoners came on the turnpike and shouted to the ferryman, and stormed -   j at his silence, and cursed his obstinacy; but all were forced that morning to wait. It was high noon when Cyrus was seen hurriedly to thrust his pike, and twist it about and about, to draw it up nearly to the surface, then to strike deep again,  ! and again to twist it about and about. Suddenly he rushed away to the lower side of the barge, and, wait-   : ing a moment, wielded his pike again with better cau- - tion.                      '  The frail and torn night-dress could not resist the   ! force of the current. It was in her long hair, her long o: 1 ,      394  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. and waving hair-her silky mesh of hair, that Cyrus must twist the rude iron. So he drew her to the sur- face, but he dared not' attempt to lift her out. He waited, until the skiff-rowers came, and they too, gathering tresses of her hair in their hands, lifted her in. But the child was gone!    %* X- - * Gentle Reader! it is a grim close to a dreadful tragedy; but now, I'll warrant me, you have a thought-which is only a conjecture-which lends the lurid gleam to complete the sombre picture; which im- parts to the ring of it, the hard metallic tone that vouches the fabric finished and whole. A thought of yours, I say, and a thought of Dr. Coverley's, and of Cyrus Todd's, and of the borough people. But when, that afternoon, Reginald went weary and stricken, to solve the doubt-for your thought was only his doubt-when he found again at the foot of the "Peak," the uneffaced traces which they had found in the morning; when, long and earnestly and tenderly, he sought of the hard rock above the pool, to know the manner of the end, why, now, how think you, it appeared? The hard rock of course held its secret. -No earnest- ness would warm it into confidence. But the ice, cold   THE HEART   OF  MABEL WARE.     395I as it was, melted into showing two or three places where it seemed that the fingers of a clutching hand  had grasped there for support. The ice would tell the seeker no more than this; but at last, the root of a shrub, with its stem torn violently off, pitying the anx-  ious doubt of the poor man, waxed garrulous and told him all. And it was not by her own desperate will, after all, but by a false step on the desperate declivity. So Reginald bore back with him that night a lighter heart.     CONCLUSION.     'Toe an ende the knight had come; Sat the companie all dumb; While for a brief musing space, Silence held alone the place. Then each stout knight seized his lance, Cried " to horse," donned helm and glaive; While eache dame looked still askance, As each had thought of a fresh grave. Rose they then with sudden speed, Mounted eache his rested steed; Tooke the earlie morn's gay pace, With a newe smile on each face, So they rode, this brave companie, Two by two, and three by three. Pricked they on, but as they went, Manie a looke to yo knight was bent, Y. faire dames, the genthest-eyed, Gazed and wondered who might ride, Thus amidst them all alone, Unsaluted and all unknown. One thought of a lover, across a sea, And her questing glance asked, " can it be, "That my lover rides here, unknown to me?" Faire ladye, I know not but 'twas he I And another, bethought her of tales of olde, When ye poets wrought their rhymes in golde; And she blushed in thinking " can it be, "That ye knight rides with us, for love of me "' Then agen her eyes like stars, Shone upon his visor bars, And she pined, to solve the doubte: Ladye, I think thou hast found it out.   CONCLUSION.                 I IN the introductory sketch, if it be not forgotten, it noble character of the true woman." This expression, and others similarly indicative of an intentional vouch- ing for the naturalness and womanliness of my princi-    I pal character, may have awakened in the minds of some    I readers, occasional unpleasant doubts touching the value of any opinion of a  writer who is capable of such an estimate. Perhaps, indeed, some may have allowed the     I curiosity, to which the book was indebted for their peru. sal, to deepen :into amazement at the apparent incon- gruity of the character, justly inferrable from the vouch  : 'D-"]     400  THE HEART OF MABEL W  ing prediction, and that developed in the issues of the story. And if any have followed the progress of the romance, with another motive than mere curosity; if they have so munificently rewarded the author's art, as -gazing on the picture--to have made the painted forms real in their warm imaginations--if any have re- joiced with them in happiness, sympathized with them in perplexity, trembled and despaired with them in desperate adversity, and perchance wept over them, dead-why then, it is conceived, that such-viewing the monstrous spectacle of a mother's heart swelling with murderous desires, as she looks upon her own off- spring-may have experienced an impulse of indigna- tion, that the author should still sustain with unabated sanction, that mother's original purity and nobleness. Well then, if these conjectures are not idle, but are well put; if I have been so unfortunate as to excite amazement, and perhaps indignation, instead of sym- pathy, then permit me to acknowledge the failure of my plan. I had hoped that the integrity and candor of my heroine, evidenced by copious extracts from her Journal; and inferential from the picture, so imperfectly sketched, of her happy girlhood; would be sufficient to establish that portion of her life, in the estimation of every reader, as pure and good. I had hoped too, that the exigencies of timidity and inexperience, the loneli- ness of the simple child in the great and gay world,   THE HEART OF    MABEL  WARE.   401  the urging claims of old-time friendship, and so many clamorous and hurrying voices, might have seemed so pressing and cruel, as to have excused her consent to  the unnatual marriage-to that degree at least, that the most severe might have regarded it as a pitiful failure  to resist, rather than an insincere and wicked compli-  ance. It was my intention so to picture Mabel Ware, and so to array the urgent motives that impelled her to     a this first false step, as that all readers should be inevi-  tably charmed with her maidenly innocence, and pity        rather than accuse the poor child, who, yielding to ap-3 peals which seemed so irresistible, became 'the victim       of a blighting alliance. It seems that in this I have not  succeeded; and  therefore, I acknowledge  my failure.                   -  But, if it should be said, "Nay, now, sir author--in  this regard we have no  issue with you. We did ad-  mire and love her maidenly innocence.   We  did not  accuse her of crime, but only pitied her fatal error, in the marriage; and we began to think her early promise belied, then, first, when she let fall the expression of  fiendish infanticide, into the blue eyes of her helpless  baby: and afterwards, when she fled from her husband       : kvith the seducer."  If any dissatisfied readers should set themselves right in this wise; why, then I will go ,ladly back, and retract the acknowledgment of failure,    I made a   few lines above. I have not failed. I deny      402   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. that any other act of Mabel's life, after her marriage, j was inconsistent, or wholly unable to be construed con- sistently, with the impulses and motives of a true, a high-souled, a warm-affectioned and originally pure woman. Will no one recognize-will you not recognize, gen- tle reader, the full scope of my meaning, when I say, that in looking at this child, the offspring of a union to which she could not find a consenting pulse in her heart, and in feeling that she had given it a moiety of its life, Mabel felt robbed? That she instinctively reached forth her hand to grasp back, and try to have again, that of which she felt defrauded? Will you not conceive me, when I say, she felt that an impalpable tie had, in this child taken a form tangible and indisso- luble; and that she was wholly unable to reconcile her heart to the consciousness of the chafing ligament? that, once and again, she raised her hand with impetuous gesture and rash design, to sever the fatal fetter? that she only restrained her hand from so rash an act by the quick-returning consideration of the blackness of the crime? For the rest, who shall say, now, after so many of the purest, the noblest, and the best of those who are kept for us in the divers memories of the past-so many of the brightest creations of fancy, moulded in .the warm and living imaginations, and stamped for immor-   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.      403 tality, by the embalming pens of the sublime old masters of romance and of song-so many of the young, the lily-browed, the high of hope, the warm and . true of heart, in olden time and in our own time too, have "loved not wisely, but too well;" and have been so bountifully forgiven by the sternest judges--who now shall say, that only the impure and the un- natural, the vicious and the wanton-monstrously yoked in some unequal and blighting alliance-have' leaped the pale of the prisoning coverture, and sought liberty and love, forgetful, alas, of bright honor, and long suffering duty? zi * / * .

FLOY BARBEYRAC is living with her stately grand- mother, who is now no more than a stately wreck, in a city a long journey away from the old home. It is a beautiful and happy-hearted child.

Cyrus Todd still drives his ferry, and sneers at the opposition steamers with double virulence, since Cyrus Todd the younger, like a traitor, went over to the enemy. The case was this. Martha Ruggles--that grievous spin-  ster--came, when, a little after Mabel's death, the place had been sold to strangers; prompted as she declared, by gratitude and a disposition of kindness toward the man who had rescued the body of her mistress, to the house of the merry ferryman. After remaining a    I     408  THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. weary time, she continued to remain. Evidently, it was a siege. Storms of sighs and showers of tears were directed with admirable skill against the defences of Cyrus' heart. The stout old jester, who had borne so bravely the rains of many a winter and the freshets of many a spring, could not withstand the autumnal floods of those hazy eyes--the mournful blasts of that too sensitive breast. He yielded. The besieging host, with bountiful largess of triumphant tears, marched un- opposed into the yielded citadel. But spleen was in the heart of the younger Cyrus. Rebellious thoughts haunted him. . Dire were the cuts, administered in his official capacity, upon the sixteen plodding legs, which it was the mission of his life to stimulate and inspire. Even the mouldy heads awoke at the stall-windows, where they were wont to sleep. Bitterness was in the young man's soul. Hence it is, that Cyrus Todd now employs a " slip of a boy," to wield the persuading whip-cord-a cross-eyed " slip," one Ruggles by name- while Cyrus the younger stands at the wheel of one of the Rail Road steamers. Capt. Rogers sails the sea. Mr. Gifford expounds the law. The Gascon Count with whom he quarreled, grieved at his departure, and would not be consoled for the loss of a duel which he meditated. The village grisette, whose name was Gilberte, gazed over the sea after the vessel that bore him away, and lamented, like   THE  HEART OF MABEL WARE.      409  Ariadne, her unreturning lover. The Count and the    ^ grisette, indulging in mutual sorrow, fell into a mel- ancholy sort of marriage; which proves a happy one however, crowned with two most boisterous pledges. Concerning these people, it happens strangely enough, that I know, from having fallen in with them by chance, and being hospitably entertained at their little chateau, two leagues from the village where Eugene Barbeyrac died. For last summer, when I was travel- ling through Anjou and Gascony, I turned my horse's head and rode ten leagues from my course, partly in mere wantonness, and partly out of idle curiosity to see the place where was enacted one bloody scene in the tragedy I did wot of. Well, coming just on the night- fall, to a little chateau at the roadside, and inquiring of the gentleman who was leaning on the pretty garden gate concerning the route, it chanced that we fell into / a trifle of conversation. Learning, bit by bit, my er- rand, he revealed to me that he had known something  , of the matter, and inquired with abundant concern as to the probability of Mr. Gifford's return to claim his quarrel. Being of a vagrant bent of mind himself he resolved to join my vagrant expedition, and to that end pressed me to partake of the hospitality of his place until the morrow. And so, in the evening, that charming Gilberte-Madame de Saint R---- now-told me, like a mighty little gossip as she is, every, the most trifling incident that had occurred from the arrival of --  S ,/.     "O   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE. Eugene, up to her own marriage-including also the birth of the twin-pledges thereof-as naturally growing out of the affair; together with such mountains of ro- mances inferential, and labyrinths of mysteries inferred, as went near to make an innocent of me. But the wine these good people ply their guests with is villain- ously sour. There are four graves in the quiet country burial- place. Marble monuments are over each. Three of these are inscribed with simple names and dates. The other bas a longer inscription. A harsh word is ever on its chiselled lips. It utters, above the grave which should be peaceful, a rude proclamation to all gazers. It is that which marks the mound whereunder Eugene sleeps, close by his father's side and not far away from the others. He is written down, as " foully murdered, by the hand of a seducer and assassin-Philip Suther- land." But oh, it is strange and humiliating and awful to see, how tranquilly, here, in the very presence of the accu- ser, the accused too sleeps on; so near that the voices of any strollers who read the tablet must go over his resting-place. There is no warring of grasses, of flowers, or of airs between these two. The sturdy myrtle ha-. crept across the intervening space, and won to his close embraces the blushful rose, which tosses up for both mounds at once, its vicarious offering' of fragrance to the summer heaven.   THE HEART OF MABEL WARE.        411     : In another spot only a little way removed lies Ma- bel. On one side is the old man, whose heart would turn to stone in spite of him; and who, after all his dread of discovery, must needs, one night, blurt forth the unsuspected secret, so awkwardly, himself. (I won- der whether his heart is stone yet, or dust!"A tanner now, will last you nine year." How long a miser's heart will last, one that is turned to stone too, I think the grave-digger forgot to mention.) On the other side of Mabel, between her and the two, whose fierce hands, for love of her, struck out each other's lives, lies the true heart that bucklered her's so manfully to the end. There, in the fall of the last year, we laid Reginald. And so the four are together. No cloud, no sun- shine, nor shower nor storm, shades or illumines, blesses or scourges one, and passes without touching all. The gentle guardian and protector, the deceived hus- band, the sinful but proud lover, all are there, and there in their midst, tranquilly as the rest, the woman they died for. It is fitting, as I think., Fitting too that we leave'them. In Pace Requiescant. THE  END.
