PHILADELPHIA:  PUBLISHED BY BARCLAY & CO 1 NORTH SEVENTH STREET.     INTRODUCTION.   THE following is a narrative of much suffering; it cannot but call forth the sympathy of every well-meaning person. Some may think the Hermit has strange notions, but they must consider how he received his training. Though he may seem to be severe on certain individuals, he has been as mild as the cause of truth will permit. This is no spite work; he has ill-will to- no one. After a life of suffering, he has found a place where he may enjoy a season of rest.  Though he has confidence   in the generosity of his fellow-men, and believes that few of them would wish to disturb his meditations, he has thought best to use precaution. Ix   Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1869, by BARCLAY   & CO., In the Clerk's Offie , the District Court of the United States, in and for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.   THE HERMT OF THE CHESAPEAKIE   A SHORT LIFE-TIME BEFORE entering upon the narrative, there are three truths that should be set before the reader. The first is, that human nature, left to itself, would procure its own destruction; or, in other words, "foolishness is bound in the heart of a child," Every one who acts upon the selfish principle, is still a child. All manhood comes by the training of Divine Providence.  The second is, that unmixed happiness (even if it were attainable), is not man's na- tural element while in a state of probation. All our solid happiness is the legitimate fruit of those troubles which we take so hard while passing through them. A king, said: "it is good for me that I have been afflicted." The third is, that this is not the "Age of Reason." The reason why the world pro- gresses faster now than it did in some of the past ages, is because Faith is reviving. It is Faith that overcomes difficulties. Faith accomplished all the great achievements of the past: it is now brought to bear upon the common affairs of life. This is emphat- ically an age of Faith. These truths will be confirmed by the following pages. The events set forth claim not the attrac- tion of daring adventures, but if the reader has ever tasted sorrow (and who has not?), he or she will know how to sympathize with one upon whom  the storms of life have beaten with great severity, until "His face is furrowed o'er with years, And hoary is his hair," and his heart is subdued with grief, " never- theless I live," and enjoy life, "by Faith on the Son of God." The intention is not to give all the events of my lie, but let one be a sample of many; and oiy such as appear to me, looking back from tis distance, to be  interpositions of Divine Providence, by  which my course of life was'directed.  Not to recognize the Divine Hand in the  management of the affairs of individuals as well as nations, would be practical atheism; because, faith in God's providence is but an i acknowledgment of His existence; which    beng withheld, leaves the cleft open for the wedge of atheism, but given, is the clinching argument for His existence. Without thls Faith, no one can believe in the theory of redemption, the pivot of Christianity. This thought will be ever before me while relating the events that led me to become a hermit. The farthest back my memory goes, is to the time when I was large enough to play about the house and in the garden, thinking it a great adventure to go as far as the road gate. The house and out-buildings had a ghostly appearance, being after an ancient pattern and I knew nothing of the outside world, but judged it by the scenes around me. Therefore, if the cities and landscapes could have been painted down just as they existed in my imagination, they would have presented quite a picturesque appearance. The furniture, also, was after the manner of old times; not only the pattern, but the very carvings and caricatures, intended for ornament, suggested ideas of terror; of being torn by wild beasts, or carried off by gob. lins. Such things were frequently spoken of by the slaves, and were associated m my mind with every object upon which my eyes rested day after day. One winter night, when several of the neighbors happened in at once, they talked of different things, telling tales of the sea, cities and foreign countries; and, though quite small, I became so interested that my sleepiness left me. A large fire was burning in the great wide fire-place, the circle was made larger as the heat increased, and one story followed another until late in the night. Stories are so much plainer than anything else grown people say, that a liie child understands them, and will listes when it would notice nothing else. I waes charmed with all the stories that were told, notwith- standing some of the words hi no meaning for me. But this, perhaps ade the whole story the more romantic leaving some parts to be filled up by he imagination, which was worked up to its utmost. When the conversation tuened, at last, upon ghosts, my fears were excited, but my - interest was not the least abated. I sat close to my mother, drawing my feet u     fi;r f';::r some ghost woll'd pull rle down through the floor; and looking around few few minutes to see that none were reaching after me from the outside of the circle. Every time I looked around, the furniture appeared more ghostly than ever, shaded as it was from the main part of the light that came from the, fire, the remainder casting over everything in the room, a dancing, flickering shadow. The impression made on my mind that night will never be erased; and, in after times, it took strong determination to go anywhere in the dark. 'That night my prayers were but little comfort, I was afraid to sleep alone, and wakened my mother several times in the night, being tormented with frightful dreams. There was one field that was in pasture all the time I can remember, and there, with my playmates, I plucked the flowers that grew in early spring, and the clover blossoms, and blackberries in their time. ,'here wa the field which was in wheat two years: in harvest time, the ringing of the scythes made music that I still remember; it is Jearer than any note I have heard since. When the growing corn became higher than i -iy head, then was a season of fin; and vhen the peaches were ripe. or the apples, i to climb the trees and take the fruit, and eat, and talk, and play-free from care-then  was my hour of happiness.        a The garden, too, though not laid off with I the same-regard to symmetry as some I have  looked at since, was a model garden to me. a There was the pink, the shrub, and the lilac; i the balm and the peppermint; the currant d and many other things; which I gazed o upon, tasted, or of which I breathed the - fragrance. Sometimes, the garden walks, tc with their abundant grass, became a bed for fo myself and playmates, where we would lie h under the shade of some bush, and talk as e: children will, regardless of the flight of time. w Each golden hour, as it flew, carried no w record of us, save that we grew in stature, V and were buds of promise. The shade-trees that stood in the yard, b with wide-spreading limbs, upon which we di learned to climb, and the carpet of grass beneath. where we rolled and played, saw many hours pass in the same unconscious d happiness. My playmates were the children of the next neighbor, two little brothers, ho who came often to play with me, and another bo little boy that lived farther off and did lat not come so often: they were all older than as myself. It might be supposed, from what has been t said, that there was no bar to my happiness; fro but such is not'the case. Though much of the fat tim- was spent as above related, too often it to happened that bad temper destroyed my happiness, and, to some extent, the happi- in ness of those about me I was very selfish, tur and wanted to have the best plaything or far the best place, and generally had my own way because they, being older, indulged me, the   which does not often happen among children at play. H demlanded ofteni that they should forego some pleasure for my advantage, or to gratify a notion, and if things did not go just as I wished, would be very quick tem- pered, use unkind words, and sometimes even resort to blows. But they generally man- aged to please me, though it required consid- ng erable ingenuity. When playing alone, I have many a time got angry at my play-things and broken them, or playing with a ball would throw it as far as I could, and sometimes find it no more. And when nothing could please mne I havo - remained in a sullen mood for hours, lying on my face, biting the blades of grass into short pieces. But I was tender-hearted and affectionate; when it was a real grief, and not "a mere offense, my state of mind was far different. Being fond of pets, a cat that I called mine, was missing several days; and finding it dead, I lay onde whole afternoon on the grass thinking about it, and did not go in "till the sun was down. Though I did not always do as my mother told me, yet I loved her, and if she went l. away only for several hours, the time seemed n long till she came back. There is an inci- d cident that conres often to my remembrance: ,it occurred ole afternoon when she had gol,0 ,to stay but a short time; it was in the ehilly 1 days of autumn; she had only grone over to a neighbor's house, yet I felt likhe an orphan. I stood by the stable-door sheltered from the wind, and looked across the field, and waited. and waited-as I thought, a good part of a lifetime-so long did that hour seem. In the distance were the trees of the woods, and, over their tops the red sky of early twilight -nearer to me the field of corn-bladed and topped, and the fence along which I watched for her to come home. Now and then, as hope seemed slim, tears would  - -  r eyes, and fall down upon the fg would my eyes be for a minute! , wiping away the tears I woul, . While watching, I saw a we.  down the lane, but when she passed by tnr bars and did not come through, ny childish disappointment was keen, and bursting into fresh tears. I repeated to myself again and again, "why don't she come home? why don't she come home?" My father would sometimes let me ride on horse-back, and take me with him to a neigh- bor's house. The last ride I remember, was later in the same autumn, when he was going as far as the Ball. The Ball was a village which had grown up around an old-timee tavern, having a large wooden ball suspended from  an arm in lieu of a sign-board. My father was going-to have a horse shod, and to attend to some other affairs. On the way,'just as we turned into the "main-traveled road," it was necessary to turn to the right to go to the village, but not far from the, corner toward the left, there was a small house, and children playing in the road I felt a desire to go there; why it   was I cannot tell, but the looks of that house, that group of children, and the sur- roundings, have remained deeply engraven on my memory until now. A little beyond the house there was a turn in the road, and I could see no more. The day was mild and beautiful, clothing every object-every view with its own lovli- ness. This was the farthest I had ever trav- eled since my remembrance. Each farm- house or more humble dwelling received its proper share of attention, and made its share of impression on my mind. In front of one house, leading to the road gate, there was a row of tall, aged poplars, which could be seen from a long distance. To my mind they presented the idea of grandeur, and the dwelling proved to be rather fine compared with some others. Coming in sight of the village, its houses jumbled together. in places, and again scat- tered in others, it filled me with emotions hard to be'described. My imagination clothed it with a grandeur not realized in any place where it has been my lot to travel. It seemed to me as if it were a place where it would be a joy to live-where every thing was gay, and more desirable than the common things of life. Entering the streets, I could not turn my eyes this way and that way fast enough to look at all distinctly, but all  together presented a mingled mass of gayety, and I was as if in a delicious dream. Yet this village would have had but a shabby 1 appearance to another child of my age, that I had been raised amid the bustle and show of I any city or large town.         t When I came to the blacksmith shop this i dream of delight was somewhat spoiled, for t then it was plain that even this paradise a could have some dirty holes in it. This cir- t cumstance has been of use to me many a time since; for by it have I learned that h when any good thing is in prospect we n paint it in golden colors, and imagine that, r when once in our grasp, it will give us unbroken c pleasure. But having looked into all its n parts, we find some stern reality, and, more-  over, that this reality which seems to us as the dirty spots of our experience is the ii means by which we are enabled to enjoy the t good that is allowed us.  I played and watched some time about ru tse slhop, then ventured farther away. At fi one place I stopped to admire a beautiful I 4 lattice work; at another, some flower pots; r at another, a canary bird in a cage; at d another, a beautiful ornamental tree, so tl different was it from anything I had ever h seen. Thus two hours or more were whiled h away, (so swiftly did time pass,) when I a] thought my father would ,be uneasy about fr me; for he had told me -ot to stay long. cl When I came back he was about 'to start to ci look for me, but he was now saved that trouble. uE He told me to get into the carriage, and, after re driving upon several streets of the village, al and stopping at several places, he took me st to a confectionery and bought a whole pound B   t of candy for me. We now started home: the r- objects on the route were looked upon, but not n with the same interest; my thoughts were d more about the candy. d  As we came near the corner, to turn into the lane that led to our neighborhood, it was ; twilight, and I could only see the outline of - the house that had attracted my attention - in the morning, but my imagination pictured - some desirable sight beyond the turn in the sroad.  After that, any place 1 heard tell of, seemed to be somewhere on that road. t  From this circumstance I drew a lesson in e after times-that children should be per- I mitted to see and understand as much a Ipossible, for what is partly veiled from them. either by design or accident, they clothe in gorgeous colors, and picture out romantic forms never seen in real life, and thus lay the foundation for many keen disappoint. ments. Suppose when I came in sight of the vil- lage, we had turned off on some other road, and I had never seen it till a half-grown boy, it would have existed in my imagina. tion as a place of unmixed beauty, where people were never troubled with the common things of life. That. thought would have modified every other thought, and my mind would have been moulded into the belief that such was attainable in this world.' And even after the illusion had been dis- pelled the seed it had planted would still have grown; my plans would have been built on false premises, and the end of my life a shipwreck. Though I could not trace the connection at the time, the fact of that false picture being blotted from my mind on the same day, had great influence on my after life, and helped me to bear up under the many hardships that fell to my lot. When some time had passed, and I did not have an opportunity to pass by the house near the corner, and go to the bend in the road, to see what was beyond, the conclusion came insensibly stealing over me that it' might not be any thing very great after all. One night, as I lay in my bed, I was think- ing of the sights I had seen, and picturing to myself what a nice house I would have when a man; and while among the sur- roundings, the furniture and clothes, the finehorses and coaches, I fell asleep. When I awoke, the shadow of a life of sorrow was resting upon me. While I was feasting in dreams of grandeur, my father passed into the world of spirits. My mother, whose health was delicate, soon followed. During his burial, and her short sickness, the bustle and stir of friends going and coining kept me from realizing my loss. It was not in a small child to reflect. Ideas are ither forced by circumstances upon childr4, or steal grad- ually upon them, so softly that they do not recognize a new thought, but imagine it was always with them. One and another would stroke my head, and say, " Poor little boy!" But the words did not make me feel'sorry.     THE ORPHAN. HE inconvenience I mostly felt, was l from seeing strangers at the table in the place of my father and mother and being compelled to ask some one else for favors in the place of them. , When I went out to play I was lone- some, and, coming in, there was only the hushed undertone, the soft tread-then the deathly silence-broken only by the tick- ing of the old clock. Then, again, would I try, to think of some kind of play. All this time I wao only disconcerted on account of the estraint, and was even fretful while the Neighbors were together paying the last respects to the remains of my dead mother. When the friends took the last look, I was led forward to do the same, and kind words were spoken to me; but I did not compre- hend them, nor indeed anything that was  going on. They told me she was dead, as they had told me of my father; and they  said the people were going to take her to the burying-ground; but I looked on in silence I as the procession left the house. After they were out of sight I stood a long i time in deep thought. It seemed as if this  would only last a few days, and then she ( would come back and love me again, and i things be as they were before. Then I won- i dered why they had not brought mry father t back, and the chilling thought began to a steal over me that I would see them no more-" see mamma no more! see papa no t more!"Then I knew what it was to be an o orphan. A heavy load was on my heart. I walked w through the house to go up to my own room. t Each step made an echo that sounded strange, e and rested heavier and heavier on my heart. t The sun was down. Reaching my own room, g I stood at the window a long time looking m out among the thick leaves of the shade M trees that hid every thing else from view h except the sky, showing here and there be- gr tween them, and I wept as only an orphan to can weep. Long after the stars had been showing fo themselves between the leaves, I stood there, m still looking out, wishing my father ald go mother could come back again. At last, to when overcome with fatigue, I lay down with to my clothes on. Looking up at the dark cor- th -ers of the roof, I felt my utter loneliness. th But sleep soon came to my relief.    ml 1 awoke next morning with the impression of having come back from a long distance. in Eveiything looked strange. The load was me on my heart, but not so heavy. I did not wa care to eat nor play. There was nothing to thi ask for, and no one I could ask with pleasure. co I was miserable, and -they gave me a dose of W] medicine.                cot Mrs. Terry, a friend to my mother, andd ath kind lady, came and took the place of my wh mothel in the house but not her place in a my heart. Yet I learned to have some con- tr fidence in her, and my lonesome theling did   partly wore off. Some time had passed when, one day, a great many men came in gas carriages, and on horseback, and took away in my father's cattle, and horses, and plows, er, and everything; and strange people moved ne into the house. Another strange man staid in. all night, and talked kindly to me, and told ie- me to call him Mr. Walters; and Mrs. Terry ly put all my clothes in one bundle and gave en them to him. lIThe next day he took me and ;k- my clothes into his carriage, and after Mrs. ry, Terry had bid me good-bye, and told me to  ae be a good boy, he drove off toward the high. ie way. le My heart was sad as I saw the old house 3t for the last time; and as we turned the cor-  ner, and the same house came in view, and a the same bend in the road, I thought of the is day I rode with my father. I looked back until all was out of sight; and my heart was s sad. Every object I had seen that day re- s called the memory of my father and my Y mother; but now I had none. e  We passed through the village, turned to e the left, and followed the road. I was now on strange ground, and every object arrested r my attention,--a flock of geese by the road- 3 side, a tree, a gate, a house, a hill, cattle grazing, men at work in the fields, the grind- I ing of the wheels in the sand, crossing a little stream-these, and many other objects took my attention on the route-my feeiiugs a strange commingling of sadness and delight. It was late in the afternoonw when we turned in at a gate; after going the length of two fields, and through two more gates, then winding along a body of standing wood, we came in sight of a large brick house, with trees and outhuildings betokening age. Out ears were saluted with the blowing of cattle the bleating of sheep, the mingled voices of geese and other poultry, and the bustle of nmen about the barn-feeding for the night Mr. Walters drove straight to the barn, having placed me and my bundle oI ground, he spent upwards of an hour s. to matters about the barn. All this time I stood waiting impatiently, for, though the weather was not yet cold, my feelings would have been improved by going to -the fire. When he was ready to go to the house he picked up my bundle and told me to come along. He led thte way through another gate-into the yard-by the well-into the kitchen, and, putting do wa my bundle, walked out.  There was a good fire blazing and crack- ing in the wide fireplace. and this was the most like home of anything I saw. I stood warming myself, changing my position first this Way and then that, to keep out of the cook's way, who,*as bustling about supper. While warming -I noted every thing that could be distingu ished by the dim light of the kitchen winidow. It was growing dark, when a tall woman came it with a candle, and placed it on the kitchen table. Shte tamrned to me and spoke kindly; her tones did not make me feel as if I had found amy     own mother. yet they gave me some encour- agement. She asked me if I had come to live with her, and be her boy. said I looked like a smart boy; asked me if I could work, and if I would like to go to school. I an- swered her as best I could. She told me to go with her into the sitting-room, and stay with her until the men came in to supper. She took up my undle and I followed her in, when, having aken off my extra clothing, she gave me a seatf before a good fire in a smaller fireplace. She then commenced overhauling my bundle, a:d, having placed every thing in shape on a stand, she resumed her knitting, which she ad worked at but a few minutes when the ook gave word that supper was ready. By this time also the whole family (of white people) was present; which consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Walters, three boys they had raised or partly raised, the oldest nineteen, the youngest twelve, and now I was added to the number. The supper was set on a large table with no table-cloth, and consisted of the johnny-cake I had seen baking on a board before the fire; hog's liver, stewed apples, and wheat coffee, with cream. I was hungry, and anything like food was accepta- ble: I ate and drank heartily-so much so that I had ugly dreams that night, though I did not then know the cause. As an act of kindness, Mrs. Walters put me to sleep between two of the boys, to keep me warm. But this was a sorrowful thing for me: the bed was hollow in the middle, and the two great sluggish bodies rolled together in their sleep, crushing me between them: sometimes I spent the whole night planted between them, pushing both ways, and could not sleep till they arose in the morning. Then I could get a short nap, Mrs. Walters indulging me as she thought in a late sleep because I was small. As the time passed I became so accustomed to it that I could go to sleep a little sooner, but it increased my constitutional nervousness and irritability, and confirmed the habit of wakefulness, which was an injury to my health in after times. The next day was spent playing or rather looking about-taking a survey of the premi- ses as far as I saw fit to. venture from the house. It was in keeping with other farms, and just below the garden a rivulet ran by, leading into a wider stream, where, as I after- ward learned, the people of the neighborhood caught fish, turtles, oysters, and other luxu- ries. At the head of this rivulet also, there was a mill-pond, which was another resort for those who were fond of fishing, gunning, and the like occupations. The month of November was now gone, the farm work was done, and there was little for the large boys to do except to get up the winter's wood. This required but a few days, and they were soon started 'to school. As the school-houe. was about two miles dis- tant. M rs. Walters considered me too small to attend.    The winter was therefore passed by me in doing such things as were suited to my age anid strength, which were of little importance except to educate my limbs to work, and my mind to the knowledge that it is the reasona- ble lot of man. I became an attendant upon Mrs. Walters, doing anything and every thing she told me, and when there was noth- ing she wished me to do, I was allowed on mild days to go and play about the straw- stacks; or if it was severe weather, to look at pictures, or find such letters as I already knew, in any of the books. She would also take a few minutes at a time to teach me, and this winter I so far advanced as to be able to pronounce most words of two, and some of three letters. The golden minutes were all improved, for I was anxious to learn. When spring came there was more for me to do: besides waiting upon Mrs. Walters in the house, there were many little things I could do about the farm, which would have been but a waste of time for a larger person. I carried water into the field for the hands to drink, and watched after the sheep, and cattle, and hogs. I could make free enough to ask Mrs, Walters if she wanted me soon, and if she said she did not, I would take the big dog and go around the fields where the fences were bad, to see if the neighbor's hogs were trespassing, and spend an hour or two throwing sticks, and making the dog bark; or would lie down along the fence where the dead grass was thickest, and think about my situation,. Mr. Walters was a hard man, with few re- deeming traits. He acted as if he begrudged those about him what they ate; he ground his laboring hands to the very last stroke they were able to do, and the consequence was, that nobody would live with him. As he had not enough of slaves to do all his work, he was obliged to get white boys in whatever way he could. He kept his eye open for poor orphans that had no one to take pity on them and save them out of his hands. He would make them work far above their reasonable strength, and if it had not been for the force of public opinion, he would never have permitted them to go to school, but would have had them with the slaves, 'cutting wood and making rails all winter. I soon learned to feel when he was at home, as if I were in a pen with a wolf. He could always find something I had neglected to do, or else I had not done enough for the time engaged in it; and wJen he would stand watching me and directing me how to do anything, I have often worked above my strength, so that my sleep was broken with the involuntary motion of the muscles. Or in trying to do the work exactly right, I have spoiled it, and brought upon me the whipping I so much dreaded. To the credit of humanity it can be said that such men are the exceptions rather than the rule. My life would have been intolerable but for the kindness of his wife. who. thougk     nearly as close with money as himself, had the humanity belonging to her sex. Even in her propensity to hoard she was his superior; for while she worked hard and saved everything till it was needed, she was kind to those about her if they were willing to work: but he oppressed all he could, that he mightwaste the extra proceeds in sporting and gaming. My back was often sore from his efforts to make me a profitable servant, and when his wife remonstrated with him, he told her he was not going to feed other people's children in their laziness. But in her I found a friend; and when there was anything to eat better than common, she always gave me a good share: she seldom spoke unkindly, forI always tried to please her. Yet, she was not my mother, and my heart went back to the time when I was the favorite of a household. Now that I was an underling I could not content myself to call  it my proper sphere, and do the best I could  to make things go well with me; but felt as  a  child would that had been stolen away, ' and hoped. some  time to go back to its X arents. Jimnmy, the youngest of the three  large boys, took pleasure in doing what he 1 called, " slapping me over," and this he re- v peated very often. At first I told on him, h but he would tell a worse tale on me, and I  would be beaten again; so I learned to bear u it without complaint.  This bad treatment, together with being t compelled to bear it in silence, aroused Hi within me the spirit of revenge. My hatred oi to Mr. Walters and Jimnmy knew no bounds, and many resolutions did I  make to pay li them for it when I  became a man. Some- th times the evil spirit would suggest plans to fo my mind to be revenged on. them even now, I but al undefined dread would seize me, and I bu could not think long about it.     to The habit of saying my prayers had been ml taught me from my earliest recollection, and he thus the idea of forgiveness had gained some so foothold in my mind. I  had some knowl- m edge, also, of a  place called heaven, and to believed that my father and mother were, asl there, and the desire to go to them was en( stronger than anything else  Though there i was blutlittle spoken in Mr. Walters' house to justitfy the belief that they even lived in a str Christian land, yet, in one way and another, ant I   had learned the difference between right Thi and wrorg, and that those who sin cannot ben enter heaven. My very bereavement and hea sorrowr led me to take hold of ideas on this ing and kindred subjects with more eagerness liev than anything else.          W I   had an opportunity to attend church spo and Sunday-sclhool occasionally, but my at  akt tendance was too irregular for the lessons T 1   received there to have mnchinfluence, except opet to giv  e m e the impression that there ,wa mor 9,chr institution as the Church. This seet fact alone, gave me great comfort and left strengthened my faith. I  was in a* clas in c Sunday-school, and loved very much  to go, suE   had and loved my teacher, but the main benefit ven I received. from  the Sunday-school, was his through the good books which were either and given or lent to me. was  The second winter I was at Mr. Walters' ling I was started to school, but there was very that little attention paid to me, and I learned ting nothing of any account. The teacher's at- tention was occupied .with the children of s to three or four of the wealthiest farmers, and his the rest were neglected. The third, fourth r he and fifth winters were passed in the same ren manner. But I was anxious to learn, and d a with what the teacher helped me, and the eat help I received elsewhere, there was no mean e a addition made to my stock of knowledge. orI  During this time  I also found another friend. There was a widow who lived alone my in the edge of the woods on an adjoining the farm. Having occasion to go to her house a an few times, she saw that I was sad, and spoke all kindly to me. I  needed kindness, for the ld contil;:,I beating received from Mr. Walters as andd ::iny was too much for my philosophy. lY, The amount of religious instruction I had its received did not Ineet the demands of the ee case. I desired, above all things, to go and he live with my  parents, yet the spirit of re- re- venge seemed to have the throne in my A, heart, and I was sorely puzzled. Prayer was I with me no hard task-no idle ceremony: I ar understood that it was asking for such things as we needed; and if ever there was any-one g that needed the rough places in the road of d life made smooth by a kind Providence, that d one was the poor heart-broken orphan. S, Thus I reasoned: If the Almighty will y listen to my prayer, and if He will answer it e- then I  need not be so sad, but must ask Him o for the things I want. Now, above all things, , I wanted my father and mother back again; but this, though a  child, I knew better than to ask. Yet I  did ask that he would take me up to live with them. Then I  asked that he would not let Mr. Walters and Jimmy be so cross to me; and every difficulty about -my work, and all my sorrows, I carried them to him. Many things turned out just as J i asked for them, and my faith was strength ened, though I  did not then know the mean. ing of the word "faith." But Mr. Walters still worked me above my strength, and treated me with great cruelty, and Jimmy beat me whenever he saw proper. This made me afraid that praying did not benefit me, and the thought weighed so heavily upon me, that for a long time no feel- ing of playfulness had come upon me to re. lieve my usual sadness. Mrs. Greene, the widow, saw that all was not well with me, spoke kindly, and several times gave me a cake or something of the kind. The confidence thus begotten led me to open my mind in answer to her questions, more than to any other human being: 8sh seemed to almost fill the void in my heart left by the  ios of my parent, I passed  much time at her huse asm I  ou-ld,.doia" such work fbr her as she would let me, and   receiving many favors from her. She taught me many lessons, and to lher belongs much of the honor for the progress I made at that time. Many Sabbaths were passed at her house, when she would talk to me and instruct me in holy things. It was under her teaching I received the clearest ideas of the Christian religion; her house was to me the warmest spot in this cold World. She drove away my feeling of bereavement; when with her I felt there must be some hearts not walled in by selfishness. Her kindness gave me a new dea of the world, and she explained to me bout the Saviour. Ye ministers of all denominations, who bend all your energies to become popular with the rich, and whose praise is in the mouths of the thoughtless, you might well exchange your reward for hers. She comforted the heart of a crushed and helpless orphan, she turned the course of a life that might otherwise have ended in shame. And I was not the only one-she lives in the hearts of others-many of whom have gone to join her, where friendship never grows cold. She placed my feet upon the only Rook, and taught me how to make use of the little chance there was left for me to be any- thing better than a slave or criminal. She told me to pray for Fortitude to bear my troubles, and that the hatred I felt toward my persecutors might be turned to Love- not for their actions, but for themselves, and  that they might be led to do right. I could not see any great change in their conduct, but the assurance of Mrs. Greene that my prayers would prevail, gave me en- oouragement, and I know the effort to re- turn good for evil gave me strength. Though my lot was still hard, I bore up with Forti- tude which would lead me to indulge in some self-praise, did I not know that it was froln Him my strength came. Gradually the idea stole in upon me that I was not my own, but belonged to Him, that He had a right to do as He pleased with me, and that His goodness would not allow me to be tried above what I   was able to bear. And as the widow advised me to do, so did I follow her advice and try to act like a Chris- an.  The more I did so, the more new ideas - would be suggested to my   mind, until I ] found that my will must be to do His will, i and  be contented with my lot. As each i trouble came  upon me, it would open my a mind to some  new rule of action by which I to regulate my life. -  I was growing in knowledge of my relation 1 to God, and in knowledge of works of useful- X ness. Moreover, a  circumstance had turned h up to my advantage in the pursuit of edu- cation.  The sixth winter there was a new v teacher, a very kind man, attentive to all the a children, an'd under him I made considerable d progressi His ionduct displeased the most tj influential citizens, and they  would have 12 turned him off, but they could get no other n competent teacher.  As  their children ad- e}   it vanced the same under him as the former h teacher, and as their only fear was that his tt impartiality would produce too much feeling of equality among the children; they thought a, best to bear with him, until they could find e another, who they hoped would restore the I old feeling. The next winter, also, I had the a benefit of his kindness and patience. And t no one can tell how happy I felt for one more y added to my list of friends. Mrs. Walters t was a friend, Mrs. Greene was a friend, Mr. y Matthews was a friend-and each of them v was a friend in need-a friend that coulfl do eme good. I felt more than ever that my 1 Maker was my preserver. Another winter s came round, and my friend was gone. They e had turned him out and found one more t , their notion. I could read, write, and cipher, which was I all that any one less than a professional man 3 was expected to do in those times. But I was not satisfied; and though after that the teacher gave me but little help, I made con- siderable progress; for, even without any help, going to school was an advantage- there was the time to study, and the place, with no other care at the time, and no great disturbance. I had now gone out of the reach of help from Mrs. Greene, but He who helped me out of other difficulties helped me out of this also. I applied myself with dili. gence, and, as I progressed, overcame all the difficulties in my way. I It might be well to pause here and reflect upon the temptations of the poor, and es pecially of the orphan. They are robbed of the means of self-improvement, and scoffed, and injured, and driven from respectable cir. cles, because they are ignorant and mean. Knowing there is no hope in this world, and not having faith sufficient to lay hold on the things of eternity, they lose self-respect, and indulge in small acts which finally lead to ruin. Their persecutors make a show of respec- tability, and establish rules of admittance into the higher circles; yet, hiding behind legal forms, they do far blacker deeds than their victims. Yet one lives in splendor, the other dies in shame I The orphan is tempted to revenge by bad treatment at home; dressed in filthy rags he dares not go where he can learn what God has said, for the finger of scorn is more potent than a line of bayonets: "respectable* people pass him by--thinking a kind word-.- a word of advice to him, would be casting pearls before swine; and unless some lonely widow, or some person who id not afraid of losing respectability  by coming in contact with him, takes notice of him, he is left to his own reasonings. Bad treatment makes him feel that the whole world is his enemy, and starting from a false stand-point, he reasons himself to a disgraceful end. Thus many, neglected by those who boast of their philanthropy, and lashed to madness by those who care for neither God nor man, become ofTenders and end their lives in prison.      : But when these dangers threatened me kind words were whispered to me. FAITH came to may relief, and I was saved. Yet it was by continually bearing up under great sorrow by continually stifling in my bosom that feeling which men call a- sense of our rights, and by refraining from what men call self-defence. My road was beset with snags and pitfalls, PFaith in the roordness and pro- tection of my Maker was mly comfort and defence, and as each trouble passed over me without destroying me--my languaoge was- 'iThus far the Lord hath led me on." But if at any time I had trusted to my own wis- dom, and had done as my own nature sug- gested, my destruction would have been in- snred. O ye who have little children, pray that you may be spared to raise them up ; pray that they may be kept from such temptations, and from the evil that is in the world. THE FARM BOY. HAD by this time collected quite a library one way and another, and had read all my books through, embrac- ing every odd minute for that pur- pose. There was so much I had read about that impressed me with a desire to imitate, or to prove, or prac- tice, that I acquired the habit of meditating as I read, and noting down the ideas that  would strike me. My life had thus far been I beset with so many difficulties, that tales of 1 dificulty and suffering seemed to takle m6re  hold on me than others: and not knowing what might fall to my lot in the future, I - took deep interest in the plans which the a heroes would fall upon to relieve themselves,  thus showing their presence of mind. Then t would fall into a tramn of thought, imagining r myself in a simnlilar situation, and planning n what to do for the better. -h This was no waste of time, for the habit u was calculated to so discipline my mind, that a when such troubles should befall me, plans a of relief would suggest themselves more r easily than without such discipline. , t In one of my books there was a ship at- tacked by pirates; all on board were cap- tl ured and sold as slaves: there was one man p among them who believed in turning every tf dispensation of Providence to account, and si by his proper behavior, secured himself d good treatment, obtained the confidence of is his master and others, taug'ht them in the d true religion, and accomplished more than in is done at many stations by the mission- aries.  All this time he was away from his wife N and children and friends, who mourned him n. as dead: yet he did not count this part of fo his life as time necessarily wasted, but went t1 to work; and when he was restored to his an family, his captivity became the proudest it time of his life            su '        o-   m,  Tn another, two little boys were playing on rn the ice, upon the shore of a wide river; the it ice was broken into large cakes: before they at knew it, thile large cake upon which they were mn playing, had floated out from the shore; Ir they shouted for help, but their feeble voices "died away on the March wind. gr  Night'was coming on, and the little boys o- were cold. They knew the anguish of their d parents when the discovery should be made e and they both began to cry. They passed the night suffering inlbody and mind. Morn. t ing came at last; they were at the mouth s- of the bay and could look out upon the wide g sea. a-  The water was becoming rougher every y minute, and they were afraid they could not ; keep their footing much longer. 'I'The larger h boy had a knife in his pocket; they went to e work and scraped the ice till they made places for their feet to stand. One of them had a string in his pocket, and each of them had a stick with which he had been striking the little pieces of ice along the shore, to make them slide out toward the channel. They tied the two sticks together, and the larger boy took off his under garment and i held it up for a signal. Thus the two little - boys passed away the time upon the large - twaves, looking at the receding shore, think- I ing how happy they were before they ven- tured on the ice. Like a man, who for the sake of gain, has ventured upon a sea of crime; all around them is the faithless water, a powerful enemy and the ice being of the same material, is fast melting into its original shape--to let them down. Whatever they desire, food, shelter, friends -is on the shore; whatever they dread is ali around them. But they take courage; when one is tired of holding the signal the other takes it, and thus they keep it up all day: now they are lifted up and see the ,;!.,. now they are down and everything   : ,: hidden from their view by the waves ;.. up around them. Now and then, al ;:. ' are lifted up, they think they see the *:,';.. sails of a vessel, they watch in the same di. ,rection each time they are lifted up; now they are sure they see it. Will the men see their signal? That is the question. The sail shows plamer and plainer, but she is not coming directly toward them. She sails on and on-now her side is to them-again the sails seem to sink down, down--till they disappear. The vessel is sailing along the coast. As they saw she did not notice their signal, their hearts sunk in despair. They cried bitterly, but still held up their signal--hoping-it seemed against fate. Night came on again. They took their sig- nal down, and determined to take such com- fort as there was left for them. They agreed that one should watch while the other slept, and not to sleep long at a time. For though it was not cold enough to freeze them, they suffered very much. They could see severdi   ight houses at different points, but saw few lights from vessels. Some time in the night, after they had taken several short naps apiece, it being the younger boy's turn to watch, he was so overcome with his suffer- ings, that he lay down by the side of his brother. Thinking about home, and what a happy place it was, and what a nice thing it would be to be safe on land, he forgot his troubles, and imagined himself once more in the arms of his parents. The larger boy was dreaming too. He imagined there was a great sea-monster try- ing to raise his head upon the ice to devour them; but when he had forced himself to a certain point, he would slide back by his own weight; and between the terror, and the rocking of the ice, which he supposed was occasioned by the monster, he awoke. There was a light, as if it were a vessel standing in from sea. It seemed close upon them. He watched, and it drew closer and closer. It was plain to be seen the vessel was coming directly toward them. HEe was so overjoyed that he could not speak, butpulled at his brother to raise him up. The little boy raised himself up, and when he saw the light so close he uttered a cry of joy. The man on watch hearing it, hailed to  them, and they both answered. ( Where is ' your light?" asked the man. "We are on   E a cake of ice!" "How many of you?"   E "Only two," was the answer. By this time  the vessel had been steered so as not to run 1 into them, her sails emptied, and a boat let 1 down to take in the boys. They were treated e reksindly, and were soon restored to their pa-  rents.,    -E It would be going out of the way to tell c of the anguish of the parents and friends of e these two boys. It is enough to say they prayed, and Paith prevailed. It would also v be improper for me to tell of all the cases of o distress-how the adventurers acted-and o how they were delivered; how one was con- fi fined in prison, and what use he made of his t time--how another saved himself from the c violence of a mobl-how the General of a be- f sieged city defeated his enemies-how some t sailors, cast away on an island, planned to i obtain food--and many other painful situa- w tions, which I thought upon as if they had ni been my own experience. But it was always pi necessary to leave part of the plan unfin w ished, knowing that circumstances are always l sure to arise which we cannot take into con- sideration beforehand; and knowing, also, of that "necessity is the mother of invention." p Presence of mind in cases that required of decided action, and fortitude under circm- lo stances that taxed all the energies, seemed la to be among the most necessary qualifica- , tions of a man.             H But, upon further consideration, it was co made manifest that the men who can brave ha every danger, are overcome bysmall troubles fee coming upon them, as water dripping upon do a rock. 'So I braced myself under the many tal little troubles that fell to my lot    When Mr. Walters would beat me, my back would be so sore that it gave me much pain to bend to my work, but I would try to do everything right, and would feel com- forted; and as I worked along would sing,- "I'll suffer on my three score years Till my deliverer come, And wipe away his servant's tears, And take his sexile home." When any work would be contrary, I tried to bear it patiently and work at it with cool- ness until it was accomplished. But this r effort did not always succeed, for sonme imes a things would try me in some unexpected way, n and my impatience would get the advantage e of me, unless my mind was greatly cast down s with grief-whereby I learned that it was e good to be afflicted. When I had to find anything, or do any work in the dark, I tried to do it deliberately, and make up with the t other senses what I could not do with sight; for I thought that I might some day he blind, i and this practice would be of use to me then. In this way I tried to turn eiery trouble into r a blessing. T there was occasion, once, for some one thlat belonged to the farm to go with a wagon on a journey that would require several days. This piece of business fell to me. I a rose soon after midnight, and made a very early start. My load was of a substance that re- quired very careful driving. The roads were bad; and though I thought every spot was familiar to me, this adventure proved how easy it is for a person to be mistaken. The bestJ could do did not save my charge frorm several hard jolts; so I was compelled to get out and lead my horses until it was light enough to see. It never came to me so forcibly before, what a pleasant thing it is to behold the light of the sun ; and how narrow would be our field of action if it were always night; and what dif- ficulties we would labor under in all we tried to do. These reflections did not take into consideration the other uses of the sun, as for instance, the influence it has on vegeta tion and animal life, but only its use as a lightgiver. Then the question came up, why should there be any such thing as night? It must be that, besides its being a part of the great plan on which the worlds were created, it is intended to have sonme in fluence on the actions of men. The succession of day and night is a hRsHO of punctuality. *' There is a time to e vera purpose under the heaven." It is a lesson of patience:, I wished for day--and waited long: and it is a lesson of Faith ;--for at last it came. His ways are above our comprehension; His laws are immutable; and things Will come round as He has planned them. If we have Faith and act on it, we do wisely, and feel the benefit within ourselves; but if we do not have Faith, His ways are still immn- table, only we act so as to lose the benefit. It is a lesson for those suffering from mia-     fortune: there are times in every one's his- tory when everything looks dark ; they have this disadvantage, that they cannot see what to do, and laboring in the dark, they miss where they try to strike true; they wander when they intend to walk straight forward: then they complain at Providence because all their efforts fail. Under these trials, some are discouraged and give up, while others press on blindly, and make their condition worse by wearing out their energy to no purpose. Some work while it is day, and when night comes, they bear on in the same course until day comes again, when they look around them and take a fresh start. There is a succession of day and night from the beginning to the end of life. Those who let opportunities slip do not work in the day, but wait till necessity drives them; then they have the disadvantage of night, and say they have bad luck, and will point to some one who has done well with half the effort, because he worked in the day- light of a good opportunity. The successful man will claim that the only reason why he prospers more than the other, is because he tries harder, thus they will dispute-the one claiming it is all in ' luck, the other it is all in the amount of effort. Then let any person who has suffered good -opportunities to slip, not waste his strength with efforts directed in the dark, which ac- complish nothing; but only see to his pres- ent comfort and wait for day, (it will surely come), and then strike with well directed efforts :-it is never too late to do good. This fact in nature teaches us also the necessity of alternate labor and rest--supply and waste, and also those revolutions in the arrangement of Providence which place men alternately up and down. It shows us also the stars-those sources of light which we cannot see in the day-time, thereby pointing to the many little enjoyments free to the unfortunate, that are not noticed by the man in prosperity. This train of thought led me to commence a .separate list of subjects, which were collectively called "Teachings of Nature," to distinguish them from those lessons learned by my trials and afflictions, though it was generally some trial that set me upon the train of thought. And though some of them have been enlarged since, yet the mind was started in that direction at the time of the incident. Therefore the idea and some of the forms  of words were stamped I upon my memory as indelibly as the muiti- plication table. I was now growing to be a good sized boy;  several changes had taken place in the state ( of affairs: as before stated-the .teacher E under whom I   progressed so finely had been I dismissed, but I still improved in learning: i moreover, the habit of meditation and noting r down my thoughts had made everything in r Nature, and even misfortunmes, my lesson f books. Mrs. Greene had been carried to the a   i- grave, and my grief was almost as if my e mothter had been restored to me and lost t again. But as if to balance this misfortune s by a favor, it was only a short time after- r ward that Jimmy left Mr. Walters, leaving : nobody to beat me, but Mr. Walters himself 3 He, however, still kept on at the same rate- requiring me to work above my strength, I and acting very unreasonable in the smallest matters, such as no one else would notice. He delighted to stand by a laborer, man Cor boy, and direct him to hold his spade this ,way, or turn his hoe that way, and curse rhim, and beat him, and say, "now maybe t you'll do it as I tell you;" and then go off and follow the plowman, and measure the b furrow, and find, fault, and tyrannize over , them, so that all hated him. Bad as my own treatment was, my suffer. ings were lost sight of when I saw the treat. ment of some of the slaves, especially one man against whom   he seemed to have a peculiar spite. If there was anything very disagreeable to do, as for instance about the marsh or creek, poor Perry had to wade into it; if it was very heavy, it was Peiry that had to stand up to it; when he flogged Perry he seemed to act in a more barbarous man- ner than with any one else, as if he delighted to mangle human flesh. Sometimes he would knock him down with a stick or hoe, or anything that was handy, and leave him senseless, and go off to the grog-shop. One day he came home under the influ- ence of liquor, his manner plainly showing he had lost the. game. We all dreaded to see him approaching. We -had done a good day's work, but we knew- there would be something wrong. He looked about for some time, seeming puzzled because he could find nothing wrong. Then he spoke: "You didn't do much to-day!" "   , ...  to answer him.  Then h , .'  he knew I  always tried 1  that himself had some ,'. /   ... when I   might have esci. . .. . "You have been idling away your time." I answered that we had not. "Didn't you waste any time at all?"I still insisted that we had not. "Did you put in every minute at your work?"I assured him that we had done so. Then he seemed baffled, an walked away muttering that we had mad a poor day's work to have put in every minute. The truth was, I   had taken about two minutes to note down several thoughts sug- gested to my mind while working along. I did not see any impropriety in saying that we had wasted no time; but when he put the question so close, asking if we had worked every minute, I  was puzzled, but dare not show it, and made a bold face, and answered him in a straight-forward manner.- This sat- isfied him. I knew that if the. loss of onew minute had been acknowledged, it would take many lashes to atone for that minute; but I felt uncomfortable at having escaped in such a manna-. x   It was true that I was at work every Minute, and I might argue that the neces- AIty of keeping those thoughts noted down, to direct my life by them--thus making me a more profitable servant to him-justified me in saying that I was at work every minute. The idea of even prevarication seemed to be taken away by the consideration that he was benefited by it, just as much as by the minute a laborer is compelled to stop to take a drink of water. -  But as he did not recognize this as an act of service to him, I still felt as if I had de- ceived him. I felt urged to go and make a confession; but as it would be impossible to make him understand the nature of the con- fession, and knowing that he would construe it into a great crime, I thought it best to keep silent. But I made this resolve-that as there are sometimes acts, innocent in themselves, which cannot be confessed with- out having the appearance of guilt, it be- comes me, who wish to "abstain from   all appearance of evil," so to manage that I can i speak the whole truth without appearing to . have confessed a wrong.          i Ever after this I kept the newly-suggested i thoughts in my  memory until the rest were on their way to dinner, or until I was about  to retire, or until the Sabbath; for I felt this I to be truly a work for the Sabbath. i This led me  to watch closely over all my i actions. and to try not to offend in any point, I and to think beforehand whether I could tell o without hesitation, and in plain words, what j I had done. There were some cases in which it was hard for me to decide what to do. One c case I  will cite. In walking one day across d the fields of a neighboring farm, I broke a p fence rail while climbing over. I considered p what to do. It was evident I  had done an k injury. Though it was small, it was not be- fc neath the notice of One who sees all things. b Aly uisposition was to make good the loss, g yet it was trifling; then I thought of the evil that might come if cattle, seeing the w breach, were to force their way through; at then I   looked at other circumstances. They er ,did not seem to justify any fear of danger to there was nothing in either field that could to be hurt. I    considered that it was a rotten to rail, and if I  took one of Mr. Walters' rails be to replace it, it must be a  good one, then I so wohuld do more damage to him than I    had T1 Aone to his neighbor.           an Looking at all things, and the fact that pe the fence could be seen to before anything an was put into the fields that could be hurt, ta I   considered it well enough to say nothing an about it. Yet I    could not rest contented, mi and several times concluded it would be less- wh trouble to go and repair the fence than to qui stUdy so long about it. On the other hand, ing was the consideration that I  was to act on a I principle, and this act was to be a precedent ten -r future regulation.. So I weighed the mat- wit telr well in my mind.      . .t last I   reached this conclusion--such W 5 VV   ry little accidents are taken into account, in the es- relation that one neighbor holds to another; mn, and what is liable to happen to one man, is ne just as likely to happen to another. If each ed of these little things was made a matter of ry special attention, it would be the step from the sublime to the ridiculous. I dismissed to the matter with this consideration, that if he ever I should own property, any little tres- he pass not done through malice should be re overlooked. This little accident happened on a time et when I had been permitted, by Mr. Walters e- himself, to go where I pleased on that day. a  or, once in awhile he gave the white boys ;o a Saturday afternoon, and once in a still t- longer while-when it puzzled him to find e anything for them to do, he gave them a o whole day :--he said it would encourage Lt them to work better. As one boy would n grow up, or run away, Mr. Walters tried to t- manage to have another orphan coming on; 3- or would supply his place by some means. "He went to the city soon after Jimmy left, n and brought home a boy about two years older than myself. This boy had been pun- ished by the city authorities several times for theft, fighting, and the like misdemeanors. e hough he did not regularly beat me, as his t "illustrious predecessor" had done, he made himself very disagreeable: he wallowed ma in the dirt, put chaff down my neck, or sand in my ears, or mud in my mouth. All this I bore very patiently for a long time, and only wrestled with him, and turned it as -a joke, never showing any signs of anger. "But he grew  worse and worse, until I could take it as a  joke no longer, and at last desired him to think of some other kind of play: for besides the disagreeableness of the play, I   did not want to waste the time knowing if we should be called to account for it, I would be compelled to throw the blame on him. And, in truth, he was alto- gether to blame. This, as I had feared, only made hima worse: so -he commenced to tumble me about in a very savage way, which I consid- ered very much like fighting. I struggled to save myself as much as possible, but tried to show no signs of anger: at last he went to pounding me in good earnest. I was not bound to be a passive sufferer any longer; so I fought him with all my strength. Though my rough life had made me wiry and the amount of wrestling I had been conm- pelled to do had made me supple for my age and size, in this case I had many disadvan. tages:-he was two years older than myself, and large to his age, while I was small to mine# then he had been used to boxihg, which I knew nothing about: the conse. quence was, that I was badly beaten, receiv. ing a very bad cut under the left eye. I   had learned to bear in silence, so I at- tended to my wounds the best I could, and with the help of Mrs. Walters, my face was soon patched up.  I   dreaded to see  MA. Walters come home; he came the next fy     sober and in a good humor; as soon as he saw me he made inquiries, and I told him all about it from beginning to end. He merely said, "I will settle it," and walked toward the house. That night he sent for me to come to him in a room where he was alone. The 'dreaded hour had come: I went into his presence trembling; he bade me be seated, then he spoke as follows: "I intended to thrash Bob about this, but' have fallen on a plan which I think is more for your own good." His manner surprised me--tle itdea' of anything being done for my good by himn was entirely new. He con- tinued :-'. i was always interested in you, and like you better than any boy I ever raised." My opinion was. that 'he had always taken a strange way to show it. ' I don't like the idea of your being beat up this way by that young pickpocket." Then he could not tlink his own beating was any offence, these were my thoughts. but no 'kn'owing how to construe his wrlds I kept silent. "You will carry that scar with you to your grave; no woman will ever narry you with your face marked up like that; now, I want you to thrash him twice as bad or I'll give you as much more." I was altogether- amazed at such, a propo- sal, and still more at his manner. I was at a loss how to take him, but may as well explain what it took me a long time after- ward to study out. Mr. Walters was one of i those men who lay great stress on their chivalry. He was cruel to the slaves and  ground down the poor, but was respectful to Ioi wife, and polite to those whom he con- sidered his equals-even when drunk. He c valued himself as a man of great prowess,  and boasted that he turned his back on no  man living. His gambling was merely to y hnake a show of wealth; for he valued money v too highly to risk it in a game, except what d he considered the surplus gained by extra driving. He considered it. shrewd manage- n ment to make his hands wo(rk above their f strength. As a laborer, he considered it  chivalrous to grind as much out of me as w possible, but now my case touched another h chord in his chivalrous (!) heart. He saw w me oppressed, and 1 was a fit object for him oi to defend.               lil At this point I ventured to speak. and al suggested the difference in our ages. and that b he should not require me to undertake what sc was impossi;,le. To this he replied, "Jake, sa you were al-was cowardly, and I love to see se a boy or a mal' hl:ve spunk; you must try as him, and I will be close by to see that he kr does not hurt you much."  Now, it had come to a crisis. I had never do before been compelled to urge conscientious gt scruples againt anything he desired me to ca do, but now it must be done, let what would follow. It would never do to act upon his di( suggestion without trying my best to evade an it. I ventured to tell him that it was not sti cowardice that prevented me altogether, but he hat I considered it wrong to seek revenge, and wil   he that we were commanded to forgive When I "finished this sentence I was so frightened 1 ly did not know whether'I was sitting or stand- rd ing; but instead of any burst of passion to against me for thus disputing his authority, e. he calmly answered: * I have determined to. to punish him by some means; if I do it my- be self he will take his spite out of you; but this plan will be effectual with him, while it it will be a great advantage to you. It will re give you more confidence in yourself. You d cannot be considered as seeking revenge, y because I CHOOSE you as the instrument by i- which I will punish hn.

'his is. y what I command you to do. If you don't t obey me I will give you the worst floging t you ever had in your life: but. if you do obey L me. and put Bob under cou, I will never- y thrash you again. Now go to bed and dream ;over it." i  I retired in deep study and did not sleep till the clock struck two. It would be vain - for me to attempt to tell how I revolved the 3 subject in my mind. But finally the fear of 1 what would follow if I disobeyed, together with the consideration that it was not to seek revenge, and the hope that good might come out of evil, made me decide to make the I attempt, though there was no hope of sue- cess. The next morning when breakfast was. over, Mr. Walters ordered me to cut some- wood for the house; when the rest had gone out, he said to me, " what have you made up your mind to do?"I replied in a husky voice, "I will try it," then he told me "^ ,nt down the axe, and go gunning with hir'. It was evident that he was interestl,'i ; my case; it seemed to be a new excite::;-, for him. Each of us took a gun and I the way toward the house of another fl,;, who had a boy about my own age and size; he asked Mrs. Hughes to let Henry go along with us. She consented, and he brought out his gun in quick time, for he was de- lighted to go. Mr. Walters had not tasted anything strong that day, and was in his best humor. After we had wandered about some time, and wasted some ammunition, he sat on a fence as if to rest. After passing several remarks to put us in as good a humor as himself, he said, "Henry, let me see you knock Jake's other eye out."' Henry looked down and said, smiling, "I wouldn't like to do that, sir." "Well, both of you set your' guns against the fence, and let me see which can knock the others hat off." By this time I saw his intention, and we did as he told us, Henry to enjoy the fun, and I to prepare for battle. After we had struck at each other with various success, he jumped off the fence and said, " now if you- will watch me, I will show you both how to     stand so that nobody can hit you." Then followed several lessons in the "manly art," and we returned home. This was followed up for some time under pretence of gunning, or fishing, or going to mill, or something of the kind: Henry en- joyed the fun, but suspected nothing. When his father mentioned to Mr. Walters about 'our boxing so much, he only laughed and replied, "they seem to enjoy it, and Iam fond of the fun myself: there is no dangerof their falling out." Bob was all this time wondering how Mr. Walters could find so much for me to do about the yard. Both Henry and myself gradually became quite expert, having gone  through all the motions, and drilled until e e knew them well, Mr. Walters now dropped Henry, and called on another boy, the size of Bob. This boy went by the' name of Tom r Craig. Mr. Walters introduced the subject t by betting Tom that I could knock his hat t off: Tom bet that I could not; so we went at M it, and Tom lost the bet-much to his sur-  prise and conflsion. Mr. Walters laughed 1 at him harder than he really felt like doing o for the purpose of exciting him to do his  best. We had several rounds, and Tom ai worried himself down without getting the w first lick at my hat. Mr. Walters again h laughed at Tom, and said, "if you want to  stand up with one of my boys, you'will have . m to take a few lessons ;"'Tom was anxious to w take the lessons, and went through the same  course as Henry. But I had the advantage of being better n trained, and was too much for Tom until he  was trained also; then, he began to gain on th me, and Mr. Walters dropped him and the training too. I was now considered well ov enough trained to make'the attempt, and be my face had healed up, leaving only a scar.  None of the bound boys, nor any one else, he understood what had been going on. The day arrived which Mr Walters had appointed gi for me to teach Bob a lesson of humility. life ie gave directions as if he were going away, sti had his horse saddled, and hitched in front  of the house. Bob and I were set to work to- gether in the barn-yard--he supposing Mr ' Walters had left to stay several days. me He was very anxious to know how I had h been spending my time, and he commenced: h You've been a gentleman a good while- to had to colne down to it, at last l," I replied r that I had not been idle. He asked me if chil would not like to be a gentleman again, say o  ing that he would make me stay gentleman alot a little longer next time. Thus he tormented eel me some time, as if trying to make me say T or do something for which he might beat me. tur As he came off so well before, he was very has willing to try it over again. At last, as he in n could make a fight in no other way, he gave wou me a slap, saying that I was the old boss' by s pet and told lies on the rest of the boys. I spe returned his slap with another just like it. cou He then struck at me one of his scientific per blows I met it with One of my scientific cert 2a   hen parries, and tripped his feet from under him. rt," I was in hopes this would satisfy him that fate had turned against him; for ever since Tder I could handle Tom Craig so easily, I had to full confidence in my ability to masterBob. en-  But, instead of giving up, he was only en- hen raged the more, and made at me with great out fury. This time I planted one that stretched and him at full- length on the filthy barn-yard. am He raised himself as soon as he could, and of came again--meeting with the same success. This was repeated several times, until Bob' Fr. fury knew no bounds. He was about to mak do a plunge at me with the fork, when Mr. WaU elf ters rushed out of the barn and snatched i ne from him, saying-"None of that I none of ve that! if you want to lick him, do it with ed your hands."' of  Bob looked at Mr. Walters and then at m me. "What's the matter," said Mr. Wal. let ters, "are you afraid of him?"Bob swore at he was not. "Pitch into him, then " said at Mr. Walters. Bob came again, but not with r- so much fury. It made my heart ache to id look at him, but self-interest urged me to obey Mr. Walters, even if it made Bob suffer. is Mr. Walters made Bob stand up again and m again, to be knocked down, until he was too e weak to stand. Then he led him to the n house, and I went on with the work. Mr. o Walters came back to the birn and coml. e. menced praising me, but my heart ached for o what I had done. He told me that I was of e a noble spirit--too noble ever to be flogged again. For himself, he declared he would r never do it; and if I would follow up the in. e struction he had given me, it would soon be that few m'en could do it. He said I would some day make a good I overseer, and he named a horse that was to I be mine whenever I wished to ride out. Bob was sick two weeks. At the end of that time he went to work. He did not try to impose on me any more, nor did Mr. Walters ever give me any more rough treatnment. So my life, after that, was comparatively eas. I - still worked hard, and used my. privileges very sparinglv, but was not under the same fear as before. The fear of ghosts having been planted in me from my infancy, by the horrible, tales I heard, and by the very looks of the house where my memory first opened, it was harn to overcome. However, neither Mr. no Mrs. Walters was calculated to indulge i child in notions, so I was compelled. to g to bed alone; and to go through the hous  alone in the dark, and about the barn ant everywhere else, as I grew larger. Thus I becamne confident, and would yen ture on my own responsibility, but the feeling has never been entirely eradicated. Often in my bravest moments, a feeling, of horror would come over me that was only quelled by a strong act of the will!. There was a superstition prevalentin -i th:; part of th- country, mostly among the slave,- that if a person dreamed there was moneburied in e certain place, and dreamed it seVeiral'times ir     succession, it was sure to be there; and they had a strict performance to go through in or- der to secure it. There were different per- sons in the neighborhood, who had suddenly made a show of wealth, and people averred they had obtained it in this way. It was my nisfortune to dream of money, and in such a way as to lead me to believe it was actually there. Like most other people, mnone was to me very desirable. I studied t le matter over: there was no one to whom cauld intrust the secret; for, whether suc- ;ssftul or not, a secret I intended it should renmain for time indefinite. Preparations were made secretly, and when all things were ready, I sallied forth one night alone to seek my fortune. 'I'he lesson I learned that night was a good one; but as it had also some amusement mixed with it, the event was celebrated in verse. At this period, making verses was my fa- vorite pastime; taking the place of that buoyancy of spirit, which in my early child- hood, would break forth into playfulness in the intervals of rest between my great troubles.  It must be confessed, that in this production, I allowed myself all thile poetic license possible, both in the forms of expres- sion, and in the pictures drawn; and I would ask pardon for inserting it, but for the fol- lowing reasons:--It illustrates a popular superstition ; shows what the love of money will lead even a timid mind to dare; shows the wildnless and power of an imaginattin imnproperly cultivated; and shows what a struggle it costs reason to battle sucessfully with a heated imagination. All my suffer- ing has not been able to blot a line of it from my memlory. It reads as follows :-- "One moonlight night I 'rose from bed, With pn adventure in my head; And creeping softly on the floor, I came at length unto the door. And knowing that the slightest noise Would 'wako the 'old folks' and the ' boys,' With greatest care I turned the lock, Which, springing, did mny caution mock. It clicked, the old man ceased to snore, And grunted out, ' who's at the door?' My hopes were for an instant crushed, But quickly all again was hushed. I started out and took the spade, And for my destination made. ' T^was on a calm October night. The moon still gave a feeble light. I strode across an open field, And then another, nor did yield My spirit to a weary frame, For hope was kindled to a flame. Across the field I sped my way, Nor did & single moment stay, Until we came (my spade with me), Uto a lonely walnut tree. f I took a seat upon a stone, And shuddered that I was alone. One half the moon was now gone down, ahe other half but dimly shone. (A bre is stirring'now it seems), X lked tup through the thin-olad limbs. I mlt and mused in spirits low,     I And soo the wind began to blow.      I started up and seized my spade, And soon a large deep hole had made. Anti as I worked the wind did roar,  I never heard it so before; It pierced me through and through my clothes, But sweat was dripping from my nose. ' 'Twas more than once I thought I heard The shrieking of some om'nous bird. Strange feelings would come over me, I'd ply the spade, and feel more free. Once, something almost pushed meo. down, I ventured not to look around, But worked the harder till it ceased, And for the moment was released. Then I smelt brimstone very strong, But it did not continue long; Though, as I worked, it smelled the stronger, And might have yet remained much longer, I smelled a handful of fresh clay, And smell of brimstone died away. "I thought of spirits black and dire, I saw a dog withl eyes of fire,- I heard the clinking of a chain, The blood rushed to my thickened brain. I grasped a sod and raised it high, And aimed it at his biggest eye ;: The phantom not a second stirred Bnt gradually disappeared. Now fears were crushed; once more in harness Again I went to work in earnest. "I felt at last like cooling off, - And took a while to blow and puff: I knew imagination wrought, And thus each ghost was turned to naught. I knew I had not long to rest, For cooling off was not the best; Again my fears grew hot and high, Again I dared not raise my eye. Again I thought I saw a sight- Two spirits in a bloody fight: It seemed to be about my prize, Each one contending it was his. I was more frightened than before, But clay and mire scratched and tore. The fight grew high as they drew near, It filled me with a dreadful fear. I tighter clenched my muddy spade, And said, ' I'll see of what you're made.' I struck, ard both did disappear,- They melted into shapeless air. "I next beheld a female form Advancing calmly through the storm. A nest of serpents on the ground Annoyed me with a hissing saund. A dusky horse and rider led A troop of warriors from the dead. I worked away in mud and fear,-     f They one by one would disappear.     ( I thought I heard somebody call;     t The trees were shaking, great and small;  My vision wild and wilder grew,  The sights were horrible and new. At length appeared a mighty train Lead by a demon with a chain: While some were armed with club and knif, Some played upon the flute and fife. It sounded like the distant hum Of voices, cymbal, fife, and drum. "I saw another army come From that direction toward my home. They met beneath the walnut tree, .  The tumult then surrounded me.     ' .'. QOne time I nearly swooned away, I could not more, nor wished to stay.   The battle grew both hot and high Thewounded seemed to fall and dlie The dying groans, the clash of arms- The sound comnmingled With the storm. Both leaders tumbled in the hole That I had dug in search of gold  And after'them the armies followed, They fell headlong and rolled and wallowed. And now to hide the frightful train, I tumbled in the earth again. I worked away, the ghosts outside Still swept down like the ebbing tide; By time the tumult all was stilled The hole was as completely filled. "'Twas now long after midnight hour, The wind had nearly ceased to roar, Too late to dig the hole again, I saw my labor was in vain. Though not with victory nor with joy, I started home a wiser boy; Determined not for love of gold To hasten to be sick and old. I saw that trouble was in store For all who love the precious ore; Who would not have his conscience burn, Must give his labor in return. Who undertakes toforce his way Will have the damage all to pay, And many dificulties rise Before the man of greedy eyes. And who his life in ease would spend Must take what God sees fit to send." Among other sources of profit, Mr. Wal- ters followed fishing during the most profita- ble seasons of the year. This vas an occupa- tion that caused much exposure and fatigue. Here as elsewhere the greatest suffering fell to the lot of poor Perry. Both before and after my promotion, I took part in these labors, and truly it was a trying season both on the patience and the physical constittion. 'here was very little opportunity to sleep, and much of the time we were in wet clothes. I had studied the laws of health, and used every means in my power to prevent any serious consequences from such exposure. Vhen there was a little time to spare, and while others were standing listlessly around the fire, engaged in foolish jesting, which was frequently accompanied  with profane  language, I would change such of my clothes as were wet, and use friction to bring the ex- 1 posed limbs to their natural war mth. While t thers drowned  their cligagreeable feeling in whiskey, I used it vely sparingly and would c snatch a few minutes for sleep. Upon thisM Bob took occasion to call me such names as a "sleepy-head," and "snake-doctor." On  one r "asion having taken deep old, the best  remedy within my reach was to take a larger p drink than usual and go to bed. When   I p got up again the cold was effectually broken, o bult I was very sick at the stomach , and upon r. this Bob took cecasion to give me the name of "suer." nhese names hung to me ji while I stayed in that neighborhood. pi Notwithstanding the hard labor I per- in formed, from the extreme sensitiveness of de my nerves I was   very wakettli: this was or partly constitutional, and partly brought on. w from having been placed to sleep  between th   two large boys; so that in the early part of my stay at Mr. Wealters, Imvery seldom fell asleep till long after midnight. Though i't was so very hard fbr me to go to sleep, happil for my health, that fact once accompishpe, . slept soundly. These circumstances made me try to be systematic as in anything else, but nobody could appreciate nay case, and it drew upon me many disagreeable remark SX rihere was a neighbor a short distance off whose melon patch was destroyed; there was a great stir raised about it, and many conjectures as to who had done it. 'I'he night I started to dig the money, Bobs knew I went somewhere notwithstanding mray great caution. Sver since that he had ntade a loud talk of my habit of going out, after the rest were asleep. He pretended to believe 1- had destroyed the patch. Knowing my innocence, I was free to go and be questioned.; as there was no proof, but only suspicion, the main weight of evidence rested on the char. acter heretofore sustained. At the trial Bob made himself conspicuous and was in his glory. He stated that I nPglected my work, occasionally riding off whlen Mr. Wa. ters was away; that I was lazy and sleepy headed, anil given to drunkenness, eiting tlhe case at the fishing-shore to prove the last charge. He accused me also of being given 1- to fighting, and of being revengeful,- and told 1- the whole story of or disagreement in a t- manner v-which made it appear that I was all to blame, that the second fight was for re venge. that I was Mr. Wralters favorite, that a himself was afraid to strike me because Mr. e Waiters was present, and that as I was a h favorite I did many things that no one else would venture to do, hoping that Mr. Wal. , ters  would stand by m'e. He protested against the treatment he had received; asked ! the authorities to interfere, and found a new Iemployer. All those charges were fully refuted by 3  . Mr. W  altels and several neighbors, but as there was no proof on any one else, and as they must punish somebody, I was corn. mitted to jail, and Mr. W alters became Iny bail. Everybody knew it was unjust, amld tthe circumstance brought mne mnore into nio- tice, and made mne many friends. I was willing to stand mny trial, feeling conscious of havingr ill will to no man, ITut Mr. W  alters, and several of his friendls, advised me not to appear, as there was no regard paid to justice. 'T'lhe authorities wanted the money, and if they were disarp . pointed in that, they would be certain to, procure my conviction. I took the advice of my fi'iends. and indulged in the lbllowing refections: '  Some governments are  only a show of .r-: justice, where the rights of man are tram. pled upon for the aggrandizemeat of .a few individual The law is not a terror to evil doers, but to the innocent, when b y-robbing or oppressing them, the unprincip led len ... who work themselves into office canindulge i? their extravagant notions, When sue}t laws - :: ":i     prevail, no difference how circumspectly we walk, evil men can find occasion to do us harmn. "The sublime of life consists in this;-to have an eye single to a good purpose; to give no occasion for evil report; to bear up when people speak evil against us falsely; to use dexterity in all we undertake, as it were taking everything by the handle, so as to accomplish as much as possible with a given amount of effort; to regulate the emotions and passions, so they may-help forward with the work on hand; and to let every act, however small, be an organic part of the great work of life." THE CITY. " HEN I was about eighteen years of 5al age, death visited the house, and   [ took away the head of the family: Wf Mr. Walters was laid in the grave. Mp) 7Mrs. Walters turned all the personal O  property into money, and resolved to end her days in the city of M -, where she had been raised, and where she had plenty of relations. She obtained good homes for the two smaller boys, and gave the larger ones liberty to go where they pleased. But me she requested to go with her, as she was loath to part with me; and as an inducement, she offered me good wages. To see the city was just what had been my desire a long time. I was to be her at- tendant, coachman, errand boy, and friend. I was to be a son rather than a servant. Providence had kept the way open for me. We occupied the house until the new comers could take possession; then everything was packed up that was to accompany her and me, and at an early hour we found ourselves 1 on the wharf waiting for the arrival of the ] steamboat.               i If might be well, here to note the differ-  ence in the shades of feeling on leaving this  home, and when I left the first home I knew,  to live with Mr. Walters. Then, I was a  litltle friendless orphan, sensitive in the ex- remlne, tender as the buds of Spring, suffer- 1 jng bitterly from the loss of my parenlts, and i ,ith an undefined dread of falling into the '] hands of those that did not love me-vainly a wishing for some place in the world that was t warm with a father's and a mother's love--  with all the crude notions that belong to a g child, destined to be ground out of me by d sorrow.               * This time-though still there was a void E left in my heart by the death of the dearest a ones on earth--I was looking forward with I o the hope of one day joining them again. I t] had met with friends and parted from them- o had tasted many sorrows, and braved many, 1 dangers--had seen many evils threatening En   re me, and been delivered out of them all: this is time, as before, leaving no friends behind, but only the place with which was associated the ;o memory of joys and sorrows interwoven. I ;o could not but feel sad, yet there was hope p before me; whereas the other time all was o dread. , These scenes of parting are good-they o stir the heart to its depths-and as it boils n over, all the evil runs off with the foam; a s clearer view of life is taken, and we start on h afresh. ;,  While indulging in these feelings, the e steamboat arrived. Our luggage was the first on board; and having seen Mrs. Wal- ters comfortably situated, I took a po'jtion to watch all that was: going on. While the rest of the freight was being put on board there was time to look around and make some observations. There were several farm-houses in sight, part of several fields, and the woods hid everything else in that direction. On the other side were fields stretching away in the I distance, and houses, some of which were : close, while others were barely visible. Be.  tween these two scenes lay the winding 1 river. I leaned upon the side of the boat, think- ing of the wide world, with its many coun- tries, one stretching beyond the other, all dotted over with houses and clusters of houses. ' My eyes rested upon the waves as they moved onward toward the sea. There was a bhunch of weeds moving along with them. While the weeds were growing, they were an item in the economy of nature. But they were not even an item now. My eyes fol- lowed them as far as they could be seen then I followed them, mentally, until they floated out, upon the ocean. I thought of Columbus, when he had promised to return if he saw no signs of land, howhis heart must have swelled when he saw the seaweeds floating near his vessel-then of the timber ; that is carried to the-frozen. shores of Green. land and Iceland-then of the minerals that have been for ages preparing for man's use; anld 1 believed that nature was truly economi. cal--absolutely nothing was made in vain. Even these weeds, now lost from sight, were made to teach me a lesson. By this time the boat had moved off; I looked back at the familiar spot on the shore lluntil lost from sight by a turn in the river. 'Then, for awhile, I was occupied looking in all directions, backward and forward, and at the farm houses on either shore. As we glided by, mnly heart swelled with emotions of grandeur. Then, for awhile, my attention was drawn to the great swells, then at the foam left in the wake, and I fell to musing on the Providence that seemed exercised over me and looked toward the future, and thought over some of mny good resolutions, believing that a new phase of .life was about to be opened before, me. After having thought a long time in this strain, and prayed that the same protection might be over me in the fi-   Sure, I lifted my eyes from the foam, and looked about on deck. The raw weather had driven every one else to seek shelter, and was becoming very un- omfortable to me. Going below, I spent some time looking at the machinery; the engineer kindly answered my questions, and the warmth of his room made me feel very comfortable. Though I had but a very indis- tinct idea, after all the explanations, I could dot but indulge in some reflections on the ingenurty of man--how strong the mind is which overcomes the rivers and makes them the servants of the human family; it bridges the ocean with a chain of ideas. Also, how Weak the body is, which is so easily swallowed lp in those same elements, when they are tot in subjection to the mind. Having seen many parts of the boat, my attention was again turned to the scenery of the country, which was now the main field of observation till we came in sight of the city. The appearance of the city was grand and would have put strange notions into my head, but again the reflection, or rather the unnoticed impression of my childhood, on seeing the village of the Ball, came to my help. My inward exclamation was, " grand!" Then I continued to think,-" but ' it is not all gold that glitters'; what I see is only the outside show;-if the real view could be ta- ken, it would show many filthy spots, crimes  broken hearts, deformed bodies; revenge,  hatred, strife:-would that this view before . me represented the condition of thile people!"  The boat landed, our luggage was attended I to, and we were soon ;wheeling over the stony streets to that part of the city that T was to be our home. Thle streets were a thronged with vehicles, the pavements were i crowded with people, everybody was in the ( way of somebody else. 'This scene, as mnost  others, called forth reflections, but the lesson is it taught nme was in after life, when I came to see what rushing there was for good situa- t tions, and hlow those who obtain them, do it by crowding others out of their way; but t my rule has always been to give the road, or i go around people just as we do when we n meet in the street, and to be content with w my reasonble share. If all would do this, a tiere would be more PEACE on the great s thoroughfare of life. We were soon settled in our new home. t Several days were spent in getting all nmat- ti ters arranged for Mrs. Walters' comfort, and of after thiat I was at liberty to spend my time ti as I pleased, except certain hours of tire day, th and wirenever she gave me notice of wishing to any unusual service.       -  At first, much time was spent in looking ge around, examining the workls of man, reflect- pr mg on the triumphs of thought over the ele- co ments of nature. When I saw so much in one small spot, the question arose, Why is it of not more equally divided? Why is it all done th in one place? A little reflection showed me os Why certain kinds of business must be car- su ried on near each other; and this, making an    nd - the ground dear, it is necessary to do with as little as possible. Thisleads to pnutting up tse high buildings, close together. Then, they n- must be strong. Taste leads to ornament; bnt vanity leads to display; display makes it he necessary to use great exertions, and good ad management. , The rich seem to agree that' ry it is good management to oppress the poor. is- From love of ornament come opportuni- ld ties to labor, which make some contented he minds. But, more abundantly is produced is, scorn, meeting envy in the streets, ridicule, m and flattery, looking in two directions from es the same face. Thus come heart-aches, re. w venge, despair. id  A little more reflection showed me that re the spot thus chosen must be a place where many vessels can land at once, so the in y habitants of the city can deal with people ,f elsewhere. Then, it seemed as if everyone d would naturally try to live on the favored e spot, where everything was made, and every. , thing is to be had; but that is impossible. y  The manher in which this thought led me e to the next, may serve to show how many of a our ideas, good and bad, are received, which y we act upon as if they were born with us, "but never know their origin. When any. t thing is for the convenience of all, some e must be farther off, and hence have less - benefit than others. This rule holds good , even in trifling matters. In church, 801some , must sit farther from the stove than others; some must be farther from the light than ' others. It Is true, also, in more important matters. Some must live in climates where the warmth of the sun is not given so profusely as it is in others-some are permitted to live "n eventful times, as when Moses talked with God, or when Jesus was on the earth- whereas others live in times when nothing is taking place. And some are even less for- tunate, as those living in the dark ages, or in  time of a desolating war. But man is made for a variety of situa- tions, and it is required of every one accord- ing as he receives opportunities.' Man is made to bear even opposite inconveniences which, to overcome, exercises everyfaculty alnd every one is tried according to his strength. As I was in a place where everything was to be seen, it appeared to be a good oppor- tunlty to see foir mnyself, and form an opinion of everything based on my own observa- tions. I determined not to condemn anv- thing nor any person without just cause, but to be governed by the Apostolic injunction-- good. IThen, in all reason, when I had proved a thing. and found it not good, no one could blame me for rejecting it. After having seen many of the great works of art, I visited, in the course of time all those places where people are led by curi- osity or the love of amusement. Curiosities, such as wild beasts, and relics of past times and different countries, after having been  r  '  -  ' !. \ ; %     seen (nee or twice, lost their charm as curi- osities. But they enlarged my ideas, giving me much food for thought. The theatre charmed me, so that I went again and again. But in a short- time the charm wore off, so that to see a new play was no more than reading the daily news. My first impression of the gambling-houses was -"These are the filthy spots."  The *con- duct of all that took part was so disgusting that it was painful to enter the second time, but I persevered, lest I should form  an opinion in too much haste, and condemn themn unjustly. I left them wondering what comfort men could find in such an atmosphere-and if there was any pleasure in a game. why they did not visit each other at their homes, and enjoy it without the disgusting accompani- inents. During this time I visited 'the different churches in the city, and especially those which I had heard most abused. I had studied the catechisms of different denomina- tions, while at Mr. Walters', and now had the privilege of seeing some of the adherents engaged in worship. They all seemed to be doing right, and I ould see no reason why they should quarrel : with each other about the little differences of opinion:-every man thinks according to 1 his own  experience. Whatever evil a man v thas seen, he sets up a rule in his own mind a to prevent that evil, and some having made I great efforts to overthrow evil, have made a s set of rules which others have taken as their I  guide. The fault is not in going by any set r of rules, but in pretending to do so, and e then letting the passions rule. I joined my- n self to a Sabbath-school, which I regarded as v a  great privilege, for. heretofore, ny cllurcl a and Sabbath-school privileges had been very d meagre.                 t  Malny  of these observations required te money; but while mny mind was exercised( on such things, it was best to go througli ol with them, and Mrs. Walters kindly let ne in have money before it was earned.  'hough to I   believe in doing everything according to to system, as much as possible, there are some we things of such a  nature that they cannot be fn brought under any preconcerted rule, and di must be accomplished by using the oppor- ca tunity while it is possible, making other let things and .other rules bend for a short time. Besides trying to profit by everything to wi oe seen and heard, incidents would often m: occur, trifling in themselves, but which, set- hu ting me upon a   train of thought, would teach int one a   lesson free of charge. A finely dressed sta man was walking along the street, holding on himself as if he imagined all eyes were en( turned upon him in admiration. A  piece of the paper was pinned to his coat behind: every- the body could see it but himself.      les Then I,considered for what purpose both E *organs of vision were made to look in the my same direction, while all other sides were sha blind; why we were made to move with the 'an   ari- same side of the body always foremost. Thi's ing is to teach us that we are to hlave an object in 'view, and to follow that object regardless of ent other thngs. If we had eyes looking in all :he directions, we would be distracted from the vas main pursuit. dy  Moreover, having no eyes except in front, 'as signifies that danger may come upon us un- tn- seen, if we do not clear everything before us ng as we go. This was so ordered, that we might le, see the necessity of a clear conscience, which an knows that all duties are performed up to In the present time. It teaches us that our business is not wilhL en the past, except by way of reflection, tha- if we may not commit the same error twice, 7Y but that it is with the present-to employ d every minute, and with the fiuture, to place i- our affections on a better state of existence: proving that HOPe enters largely into the. it suin of present happiness. ;e  It teaches, also, that there is no standing ad still in life. We are always growing older, - always getting nearer to the time of death, d and should always be progressing in WISDOUV s and GOODNESS. If we could see and move In all directions with equal ease, it would allow of retrograde- 1 movements, the stand point would be the center of our operations, and that would give D the idea of a permanent state of existence I whereas the present plan teaches us that we are passing away. Our duty is to go forwir d. It teaches us to look well to,what ilnpres- sion our actions will make on others, for if ' we could " see ourselves as others see us", the man could have seen what drew    people's eyes, upon him. Then whatever view    we may take of our own actions, other people will see them in a different light, and judge accordingly.  Thus the form of our bodies develop our mental faculties. though not in the sense of materialism. "llThis is one of the teaclings of nature. Walkingl along a street where a great deal of business was transacted, my clothes hooked into a 1nail sticking from a box. This led me to reflect on those grealt evils which we try to shun, but in ventilling too close to them, we are snagged wilh smfall evils that proceed fromn tlem. 'I'hc bent way is to keep a good distance off,-a rent nmay be patched, unt cannot  be madle the same as before,-it leaves a scar. At another time the pavement was covered with sleet; it was difficult to walk; I had many times before walked on slippery ground. hut now the peculiar circumstances led me into a new train of thought. In whatever station of life we may be placed, we stand. on ground sleeted over with sin. Evil influ- ences, like the wind that blows against us, and the people that crowd us to one side, make the more caution necessary at every step lest our feet slip. Sitting in the room one evening at home, my attention was attracted to .the large shadow from the lamp, cast by one person, and the small shadow close to it cast by an.   othlr, when there was no great difference in the sizes of the individuals. I had noticed the same thing many times before, but was now in the frame of mind, resulting from the habit of reflecting on whatever I saw. It showed me how one whom fortune has smiled upon will mak.: a great show and a great noise in the world, while another less fortunate makes but little impression. Even though they be equals in actuJl worth, the nearer to the lamp, the larger the shadow. One beautiful evening I took a walk in the most fashionable street of the city. It was brightly illuminated, and crowded with peo- ple gaily dressed, seemingly bent on m:tking the  most of the passing moiment. TIhe thoughts that' passed throlugh my mnind, so impressed me, that 1 took a stand in a con- venient place, and loolking as far as I could see both ways, put the thoughts into tlhe following form of words for future,pleasure. Along this bright illumined street, The skipping step of many feet Is heard as people pass and meet. The waving dresses are unfurled, And locks are tossed so gaily curled, Unconscious of a suffering world. Nothing is done but make parade, And laugh and talk and promenade, And sip, and sip, at lemonade. Their church, it is the theatre Where they in gayety appear, And thus go on from year to year. They live as does the butterfly, Arrest the traveller's w:nd'ring eye, Admired, but uncared for ----- die. While looking at the works of art-the t great achievements of man, nothing  im- c pressed me   more, than the large ships-per- haps because they were associated more with fi the different countries of which I had read. j Another reason might have been the influ- t ence of very early notions; it had been my a habit to cut out pictures 1and save them to b look at, and among them were many pictures '1 of ships. I   learned the different kinds of o vessels, the nature of their cargoes, and the d1 countries they visited, or to which they n belonged. A   desire seized me to know all Al about them: it seemed as if it would be one pR of the grandest things in life, to be borne in Al one of them upon the bosom of the mighty ocean: as soon as my foot rested upon the I deck of a   large vessel, my imagination was tl carried from one country to another, and I pc thought the reality must be still  hmore de- we lightful.                 gC Sometimes when making inquiries about - the great works I   saw in the city, ill-man- I  nered people would make remarks about my th being green, but that made little impression wc on my mind, as most people took no notice it of me, except to answer my questions politely wt and explain things which otherwise could je not have been properly -understood.  The an   in desire to be a sailor gradually became soc ed strong, that my mind was made up to men- as tion the matter to Mrs. Walters, and ask her he permission to go-urging that the present It occupation did not call all the faculties into, as exercise, and that as the novelty of the city a had worn off, my happiness could only be ss sedured by an active life. en  While turning the matter over in my mind" te to be sure to present it in the best light, Mrs. Walters informed me that she had received a ie letter, several days before, from a friend wh ts lived further down the river, stating that hi o- wife was dead, and asking Mrs. Walters t g come and take charge of his house. She ha ie promised him to go as soon as she could o arrange matters where she was. She said' i- she had procured me a good home, with the d chance to learn a good trade.   She had e recommended me th a house-carpenter, a worthy man and a good mechanic, believing I would like the business.  She had the writings -all drawn up, and waiting to be si-ned. This she had done to give me an agreeable surprise. My mind had been made up to be a sailor; and among other considerations, I believed it to be a calling in which I couldl exercise some influence for good, independent of its usefulness. It had been my lot always. to be placed among those who (with a few honorable exceptions) paid little regard toX morals. I had been trained by circum- stances 'to stand on my own foundation, re- gardless of what others said about me; and hoped, though I was not sure, thait I had ex- erted a good influence. I believed that such a situation would be natural to me, and wished thereby to accomplish some good. Another reason was that I had , great desire- to visit the Holy Land, and this seemed to offer the best opportunity. But again Providence had opened a  way for me, and I determined to pass by my own judgment, and  trust that Providence more than my own desires. The proposal to learn a  trade was like water on the fire of my aam- bition, and it thrlew a cloud over my feelings. 131t I  had too much regard for the feelings of Mrs. Walters to show it; and as I cast- down my head to thinkl upon it, she coul not see any signs of displeasure in my face My decision was to learn the trade, and the papers were signed, to take effect the nex Monday mnorning. Mry ambition now took a different turn I determined to devote all my energies to. the business, and learn the trade as fast as, possible, so I might become a first-classa- workman. Already I saw myself receiving good wages--rising slogwly-taking contracts -endeavoring to be perfect in the art--until I could bid against the best mechanics for the contract of any great public work. I was young, and living in an age of progress; it was not impossible that, before my race- was run, some great work should be pro- jected that would rival Solomon's Temple- and it would be a  happy individual that te.-     ceived the contract. It was worth a life-time of effort. During the week I removed my luggage to my new home, but remained with Mrs. Walters till she took her departure. The next Monday morning, rising early to pre- pare, I helped her arrange her baggage, placed everything snugly in the coach and behnd it, and, with many good wishes, we bade each other farewell. THE APPRENTICE. t STOOD looking after the coach as it rattled down the street, until it turned  j a corner and was out of sight. I C  walked slowly toward my new home 5, with feelings of sadness, but resolved to begin life with renewed energy. As I  walked along the street, un- mindful of the busy throng, I thought on the ways of Providence-my eyes were filled with tears, and my heart with gratitude. Having gone up into my   room and ar- ranged my clothes, I went down to the work- shop to receive orders. Mr. Cleaver, my new employer, started me on some plain work which required very little ingennity. After I giving sufficient directions, he left me to do the best I  could. The four workmen were e busily engaged, each at his own bench, and  they paid but little attention to me.  1 As I worked along, slowly and steadily, my thoughts were occupied with the changes of E life, frequently leading me to utter silent I prayers for comfort in my desolate condition, z and help to do everything right, that I might a cause none to be my enemies, but might have c the good will of all. Now and then a tear r would drop upon my work, but no one no- a ticed me.         - Noon came, and we all went to dinner. I had but little appetite, and felt uncomforta- fi ble. Not that there was anything in my new a home to make a  disagreeable impression, but h the state of my mind was such that I was t: glad to get back to the shop. The opportu- n nity for silent prayer, and the exertion neces- rl sary to perform the work, seemed a balm for ^ my wounded spirit. Evening came, and we t] vent to supper. I   had more appetite, yet a te sparingly. After supper, I did not go p ut as the rest did, but staid in and read the Book of books.             d It seemed as if every word had been writ- w ten for my special benefit. That Book has n been more precious to me ever since. I re- s tired early, slept better than usual, and in c] the morning felt a buoyancy of spirit, taking a] breakfast with a  good relish.     M I   started to the shop mentally repeating w a   verse of the Scripture I had read that w morning-"Servants, obey in a-ll things your al masters according to the flesh; not with eye- if service, as men-pleasers; but in singleness of u] heart, fearing God." I  prayed that I might vl   e have that singleness of heart, that desire to benefit my master, and that every stroke of e work might be to the glory of God. 3. That day my work was a little more diffi- e cult, but I bent my whole mind on it, which i- was more vigorous than it had been the day , before, and succeeded in all I undertook, i without spoiling any of the-material. The enext day I had occasion to consult one of the workmen. He kindly showed me what I desired, and made one or two remarks, which led to a conversation. I found them all pleasant companions, disposed to treat me well, and in no way desiring to lead me astray. After that we had many pleasant talks. Thus, one day passed at a time, leaving its mark on my mind. When I was engaged upon a piece of work unlike anything I had ever done before, all my energy would be bent upon it: when working on what could be done with ease, without growing careless, I naturally fell into a train of thought, or was led by some of the older workmen into profitable conversation; or, when any one felt like it, he would sing. Though  it was not for me to have the pleasure of being borne by some noble ship from one country to another, the very hope that had been raised was a profit to me. I had watched the vessels, as they loaded, and then swung out upon the water to land on some foreign shore-and this led me  to in- quire what circumstance in man's life was like hoisting sail. When a man has examined enough to separate the good from the evil, and take a position-when he has taken a subject to aim at, as the work of his life, and has arranged all secondary aims to form a part of the main one-then, the vessel is loaded, and he is ready to hoist sail and start on the voyage of life, his Inind free to enjoy the scenery as he passes along. Mr. Cleaver treated me well, advanced me fast, and gave me  much encouragement. I almost felt as if my sails were hoisted. I had passed sentence on all the attractions of the city, and resolved to try no more experi- ments. I attended church and sunday-school regularly, and joined a literary society, which I  considered a rare opportunity, as they were not so plentiful in those days. I also paid a small sum per week for the privilege of a library. The friendships I formed were few and deep.  Mrs. Walters, though kind to me, was associated with my orphanage. After I met with Mrs. Greene, that feeling was not so strong; and now I  seemed to be in a cir- cle of friends. Though I had met with friends and did not. feel so desolate since I had met Mrs. Greene as before, 1 still knew that it was a   cold-hearted world-that while I walked straight I would find a friend here and there among many acquaintances; but if I stumbled there would be none to lift mo up. So I resolved not to see how far I could- venture in the direction of sin for the sake   of a doubtful pleasure, but to keep on the safe side and make my pleasure consist in doing my duty: knowing that if I made pleasure my god, and tried to serve it with. out doing wrong, it would, be sure to en- croach gradually upon duty, besides making it less attractive. I resolved between work and study to put in all my time; and by working leisurely as a rule, whenever a difficulty arose it would be a recreation; allowing myself this liberty -that whenever any harmless recreation was on hand, and circumstances pointed to t, and no duties interfered, I was to indulge in it for a short time, dropping every care. Experience long before this had taught me that something of the kind was necessary to relax the mind, and let it gain strength for the next effort. I knew that a bow always bent will lose its spring. It may seem strange to some that a mind not yet mature could stand such close appli- cation both to labor and study, with so little recreation. But this is easily explained;-I worked leisurely most of the time, and when a difficulty arose it produced an agreeable excitement. I read but little at a time- stopping often to reflect; and was free from all those vexations and cares which most young men bring upon themselves in the pursuit of pleasure. More than all this the habit was formed in early life, of doing the most trifling things right. People generally think if they spend too much energy on a small matter, they will not have enough left to accomplish those of more importance. But the tendency is in the very opposite direction: if you acquire the habit of doing small things right, you will take hold of a large matter with more dexterity, and accomplish it with greater ease. After becoming pretty well advanced, I fell upon a plan to make me more thorough in the work. I commenced to note down such ideas as would strike me, and this led: to what was very properly called "steps in improvement." It was based upon the sup- posed difficulties met with in the advance- ment from the first attempts at mechanism to the more refined stage;-each improve- ment was supposed to have been suggested by a former difficulty: in this way what at qrst appeared the trifling parts were seen to e necessary, each forming an organic part.-  he writing was set in two columns, the first containing the difficulty met with and its number, the second containing the improve- ment thereby suggested, with the same number. But it must not be supposed that all other feelings were swallowed up in ambition to be faithful to duty and to improve my time. I formed many acquaintances, and a few that ripened into the warmest friendship. Though I  was no talker, and though but little time w as spent in pastime as such, there was am- ple time for cultivating friendship, so that even now I   look back to soine of the friend-   5 ships formed then, as some of the warmest i of my life, and that period of my life as 3 among the happiest. One of the pleasantest days of my life was spent on a Sunday-school excursion. Those seasons of recreation did not occur so fre- quently then as now, and consequently they made a more lasting-impression. They were looked forward to many weeks before the time, and remembered' with pleasure years afterward. On this occasion the children were all dressed nearly alike, and trimmed, with ribands. They met in the church at an early hour, formed in classes with the teache at the head, and marched down by twos to the steamboat, singing as they went. Provis. ions and sweetmeats had been made ready beforehand  to add to the attractions of the day. We had a pleasant trip, landed at a delightful spot along the river, and were joined by two other schools. Benches had been prepared, and a platform or stage, from which the children were to recite their pieces. This was trimmed beautifully with wreaths of flowers. The impression made on my mind that day, will never be erased: so well did I love to think it over, that I put down the pro. ceedings in some light, irregular lines, as follows :- "The people had assembled, far and near, The orators were in their proper seats- Trembling, and waiting for the trying time. A  hymn was sung, a prayer was offered up; With much encouragement and loving words, The preacher told the trembling boys and girlst To ' stand up nobly; God is on your side.' Music again; and the exercise Commenced, and the people, with open eyes, With gaping mouths, and list'ning ears, Thought not of the children's hopes and fears. A  name was called and a boy arose- Dressed in his best from ears to toes. "Iie spoke about the Holy Book of God, Which tells us we are bought with precious blogd, How savages are brought to their right mind, When once the light of God has on them shined. How youth, so much inclined to go astray' By following this will walk in Wisdom's way. And how in death, when it has hush'd alarm, Man fights the latest foe with strengthened arm, "He made his bow, his speech was done, And instantly, music was begun. "Another name was called aloud, A sprightly miss out from the crowd, With all the ornaments allowed, Skipped on the stage. And she was beautiful and proud, And just the age. "Her clear and sweet and silvery voice, Was heard by the congregation, Proclaiming that Sunday-school girls and boys, Are the hope of our nation. "She took her seat, and many a tongue Joined in, and a  song of Liberty sung.     "Thus every girl and every boy- Trembling, yet full of youthful joy, Got up and spoke-sat down again, And were saluted by a strain Of music well composed and sung;- Thus they went on till all were done. Some spoke of one thing, some, another, And sometimes two would speak together. Some spoke in voices loud and full, Some animated, and some, dull. The subjects, merry or sublime-- -  Composed in either verse or rhyme. Some children large, and others small, Some low and stout, some slim and tall All in the spirit of the time, Unconscious of a world of crime. They spoke and sung, as well they might- Their hearts uplifted with delight. It was a time of greatest joy To every little girl and boy. It was an interesting scene Adults might take an interest i,. sAt last when all that kind was through, They yet had something else to do: To make their nuts and candies crack, It did me good to hear them smack. The nuts and cakes were passed around, They ate of candy, many a pound. They chatted each to his next neighbor, Forgetful of the morrow's labor. All over, they were sent away With this advice-to READ AND PRAY. J Oh, who could look upon a scene like this, And not be touched! Where many children meet, And are endeared to duty by the joy That is the offspring of an innocent- A heart-uniting, friendship,making cause. Here they are taught to think of better things: Here they are taught to love each other more: Here enemies, by magic, are made friends Herea boys that bruised each other, now shake hands;E Girls that made ugly mouths are caused to smile. Here they are told of India's depraved Yet innocent and harmless boys and girls. Who, when they hear of HM, embrace his cause, Thus putting Christian boys and girls to shame. Here they first learn to throw aside their toys, And save their pennres for a better cause. And, Oh! the PLEASURvE lasts from year to year, In preparation and in memory. Yen, more , 'twill be remembered all through life. 'Tis well spent time! Thank God for Sunday- schools!" No one can measure the moral and social good effected by such delightful and innocent recreations. That Providence which orders all things for good, ordained that the present state of affairs should- be broken up. I had been a member of Mr. Cleaver's family only a little more than a year, when he paid the debt of natlr.  Many young men in my situation, would have considered it a happy circum- stance.  I was a good mechanic, and was  now legathy relieved from my part of the r contract. I could now command good wages, i labor was in demand, and a happy career seemed to open before me.  But I was grieved.   Notwithstanding IX  had learned to accept the decrees of Provi-  dence  without complaint, my   heart was s touched Mr. 0leavcr had been my friend; t   Mrs. Cleaver was left a widow with a family Ihough she was not left penniless, though she was in no danger of immediate suffering. I could sympathize with her desolated heart she needed sympathy, comfort, help. Ihe fact that good wages were accessible to me, was owing to Mr. Cleaver's kindness in advancing me so fast. It seemed no more than right that the time of my indenture shlould be filled out. The day of the funeral was a mournful day in that family. The re- mainder of the day. and the Sabbath, I spent in devotion. I tried to mnake a sacrifice to Him who had given Himself for mne, offering up my soul and body entire to do or suffer His will. Early the next morning I informed Mrs Cleaver of my intention to remain with her. She was surprised and pleased. I told her I was willing to assist her in any project she might have in view, to prevent using up what means were left her, but rather to make it a capital to start with. She had not had time to form any plan. i I proposed, as she had generally boarded Mr. Cleaver's journeymen and apprentices, that she would take in, boarders as that would require less change (of plan) than anything else. Moreover I could procure respectable boarders. She consented to do as I had proposed. That week was spent in making the necessary ar- ' rangement. The shop was no rented by a Mr.*Vright, who had several other shops at different points, and had a large contract-building inl the suburbs. The next Monday morning I commenced work with him in*the same old shop. My wages were good. My timewas divided between the different shops and the block he was building, according as he ar- ranged his workmen. This changing ef places afforded me a good opportunity to obtain boarders for Mrs. Cleaver from among my acquaintances, and I was more careful to pick respectable men thhan to swell the number. Soon her house was filled with the choice of my acquaintances-mostly carpenters- some of whom brought their families, making a pleasant circle, of whicht I almost felt like claiming to be the centre. Though I was glad of so much good company, I seldom had either time or inclination to exchange more than a passing word.  Still, the position which I held led me to relax my studies a little at stated timnes rather than be considered selfish. Bult the loss was nearly made up by the pleasant evenings spent in innocent and profitable amusemlnent--in improving the faculties of conversation, cultivating friendship, and, I sometimes even' dare to hope, exerting an influence for good. Mrs. Cleaver, though still feeling the loss of her husband, was in fine spirits at her suc- cess, and many times refilsed to take my wages; but I strongly insisted, leaving'a small portion for my own expenses, knowing the main part rightly belonged to her.   Once in a long time I received a letter from Mrs. Walters, and once she called on me, but her duties required her at home; and from the care on her mind, she had little inclination to correspond. Yet I often heard from her through her friends with whom she had made her home when in the city. While working in different places, I came in contact with several disagreeable characters. The trouble they occasioned me was very annoying, and it required all my energy and caution to so conduct myself with them as to prevent them from drawing me into seri- ous difficulties. Day by day the annoyance grew more and more intolerable, and I heartily wished that something would turn up to cause certain individuals to be turned off.- The thought even presented itself to my mind to try to bring it about in some way, but I despised anything like plotting. Day by day the passage was presented strongly to my mind-"One sinner destroy- eth much good."' Sometimes a determination would seize me to pack up and go where there might be more agreeable company. But the difficulty presented itself that my services would not then be so valuable to Mrs. Cleaver. I al- most repented having been so conscientious wishing myself free to go where 1 pleased, fearing I had taken more on myself than even duty required. But. having undertaken a good work, I determined to go throuzh with it, even at the cost of great self-denial. Whatever duty required of me before I 1 made the promise, it was plain now that my 1 duty was to fulfil the promise -"Pay thy l vows.      , I reflected that it might perhaps be the f best for me, after all; for there is no station  of life that is not attended with annoyance i of somne kind. Not only are we annoyed in h our daily avocations, where necessity com- s pels us to remain, but, even when the cares r of life are for a short time thrown aside, and E we seek relaxation in some innocent amuse- ment Even if a lady goes to visit a neigh- a bor, there is some trouble at home which n hangs upon her mind and lessens the enjoy- I ment of the hour.  At a social party, one will have a dress not u quite finished, and will be compelled to ar- 'anfe it slyly, and move very carefully; an- h other will have on new shoes that pinch a ten- j der corn; another can only stay till a certain e] hour, and must lose the best part of the fun; w another has a horse that will break away, e; and must look after him every few minutes. Whether in city or country, there will be scarcely one that can enter fully into the pastime free from all distraction. This is a sad picture of earthly enjoyment, at but it is partly caused by our own want of be system, and partly allowed by a wise Provi- fo dence, to prevent us from running our pleas- an res into sin. The man or woman who can br eave things wrong at home, or leave any sel past duty unfinished, or enter upon any th amusement without having first seen that or   er all is right, will feel the memory of that n neglect hanging: about them like a burden. T; hey may try to throw the whole soul into le the amusement, but that neglected duty, be d it ever so tifling, will gnaw at them all the e time, and the pleasure will not give satisfac- tion. This is what leads many to accompany n their pleasures with the intoxicating cup.    ut if every diuty has been performed y and the body and mind need relaxation, no d difference how poor#he person may be, the s time is not felt as wasted,--sleep will be i- sweeter, and the mind and body will be more e vigorous. And knowing all this, any one can I enter in with a relish, and go home satisfied. 1 .he consideration that every station of d life has annoyances, led me to picture myself fleeing from them, changing my position still finding annoyances, until I became a fugitive and a vagabond upon the earth. On the other hand, to meet them with Faith and determination, would have the effect always produced by turning the face toward the foe; and I hoped to conquer them. !  There are also other advantages in pre- senting a bold front, so as, by Patience, to conquer the foe which we cannot evade. By bearing troubles, we learn to sympathize with others. If we wish to do a favor we cannot bform a correct idea of what should be done, unless the case is solmething like what we have experienced: troubles are the bands that unite many hearts. There is yet another .dvantage; we are naturally quick to speak and act, but slow to think: we often do or say things in our glee, for which we afterwarlds repent; we might have been saved that repentance if some little trouble had been hanging over us. Children thiilnkl that if they could get from under parental restraint they would be very happy, but when they have liberty, even a short time, human nature boils over, and play gradually changes its tone, until it grows into quarreling and fighting. A young man starts in business, desiring as soon possible, to gain enough to put his mind at ease: he says to himself, " oh, that I had it now, that I might enjoy it in my youth! then, these cares and difficulties would not embitter my life." If his wish could be gratified that moment, his life would be bitter indeed: with no ob. ject in view, his talents would cankler, his energies rust, his passions rage. Idleness would scourge him to despair; and he would exclaim with the wretched Byron,- "Man and the world I so much hate, 'I care not when I quit the scene." No one need say he could occupy his attention in managing his wealth for the benefit of those around him. That will do for old men who have battled with difficulties and waded through sowrows, and are now broken down. But young men are for ativa service; their energy must be spent on sow.  thing; all their faculties must be exerci ee,: orthey will breed corruption. Thestruggle -.     necessary for a young beginner, make his position the very one to exercise him. Let every one understand this, and enjoy what is within his reach. While facing difficulties, his eye fixed on the prize, he will pass, unnoticed, many trifles that would cause him much uneasl- ness if his mind were free. The impetuosity of youth will make a wreck of any man, who does not direct it to- ward some prize. Many a duel has been fought about trifles that would have been forgotten in five minutes, if the mind had been weighed down to its proper place with care, and the energies and passions concen- trated on some desirable object. A man having reached the point for which he started, naturally supposes he can sit down  andenjoy the fruit or'his labor. But, there is a son whose irregular conduct brings sor- row on his aged parents-or, enemies who are envious, seek occasion to make trouble-- or, fire spreads devastation-or, disease lays him on a bed of languishing. while pain and fevel give him but little chance to enjoy the  fruit of his past success.   There is seldom  a time that we are free t from  all these troubles at once. It seems I like a contradiction to say that they are per- mitted for our good, but, 'ust in the propor- tion that the human will is subject to the Divine, we find it true. Those which come upon us through our own neglect, are some- times suffered to chasten us sorely, but those sent on us to make us sympathize with others, are gradually lightened when we turn the power of Faith upon them.      6 A man overcome by misfortune is broken uip in business--he meets with sympathy from his friends. One who has had difficul- ties similar to his, sees his anxiety for the welfare of his family; his fevered temples w or his aching limbs will receive the sympathy w of those who have labored when -weary and at sick; the inconvenience of his wife will be ne seen by those who have been broken up, and cc compelled to live for a short time without the th conveniences of civilized life ; while the one who has suffered none of these things will an sympathize only by imitation.      de If we  cultivate the mind that was in th Christ, we can feel for others even though we my have never suffered the like ourselves but for what we cannot obtain by cultivation, will be * fir given us from  the bitter cup, and we must , take it as from the hand of One that knows tha what is for our good.          'cli Time passed on.  One of my persecutors vas had been dismissed, without any effort of the mine to bring it about; another had slackened I up, gradually, until he seemed to try rather frar to be agreeable than otherwise. In one way qui andanother they were all conquered.   qui My time had been filled out, and still an. pied other year added to the past, My home was aga still with Mrs. Cleaver, although at times the ope work was so distant that I was compelled to new take board elsewhere.  Boarders came and tone went; her house was generally full; the same whe   his scenes were acted over and over again. My Let endeavor was still to do everything right, t is , and occupy my spare time in study, save an evening now and then spent in social enter. on' tainmen. The only change respecting my- any self was, that since the time of my indenture asm- was out, I had been laying up my wages, which was quite an addition to my comfort e a There was less demand by this time for me- to- chanical labor, and Mr. Wright informed me een that for the future he could do without my een services. It was plain that to remain in the had city would bring with it the certainty of ith being idle most of the time, only catching a en- little piece of work now and then- which by calculation, was likely to cost me more to ich secure the work and move to it than it would wn be worth after it was done. 3re  Notwithstanding my attachment to the or- friends and scenes of the last few years of ho my life, the scenes of my rural life came up - vividly before me as I considered the chances ys to obtain work in the country.  Though it nd would have been very agreeable to become a he sailor at this time, it would have been neces- sary to give up the idea of becoming a first- ee class mechanic. For this, and other reasons, Is I  decided to go to the country. ie e-       THE WANDERER. sh IT   H a   mind unsettled, and far from n     being in a  disposition to follow any ]h[I sotrain of thought, I  started out on n  t  foot to look for work. Instinctively Y    I   turned my'face in the direction of -  my boyhood's home, which was not e    altogether associated in my mind 8 with sorrow: for the memory of fields and woods, of house and barn, of bush and brier and fence, of plow and fresh earth, bore wit. ness, not only to my tears, but also to that icomforting Faith which had bidden me wipe them away. When about a   mile from the city, I turned and looked back upon it. There it lay--a dense pile of houses, and-standing out above them  were the steeples, flags, and masts y mind was carried back to the refectioq forced upon me, when viewing the city th first time. Just then a fuheral bell tolled out the news that some one had gone; and as the melan- choly sound died away, I thought of the vacant place, and the mourners going about the streets. I started forward slowly in a different frame of mind: gradually my step was quickened, and, stopping often to make in- quiries. mny mind became altogether occu- pied with the object of my search. Here again the book'of human nature was laid open before me, presenting a page entirely new. Some would answer my inquiries in m tone which showed that they did not care whether I obtained employment or not; *      I L   others  uld forget that I was seeking em. plofyment, and imagine that I was passing along to let people knom my most private affairs. Some would answer my questions with a stupid stare, while others would politely tell me all .they knew about chances for employment, and direct me through by- ways that saved many steps. On one occasion I took a by-path which led through dense woods, and came out into on both sides of the path, lay a bed of flowers. I stopped to enjoy their beauties. April was wearing her brightest smile; we are seldom blessed with such a day. The birds elt its influence, and poured forth their oftest melodies, Several children were coming toward me; I watched them till they came near and began to pluck some of the flowers. Their innocent prattle was pleasing to hear. It carried me back to thie days of my early childhood. "iHappy children, to live amid scenes like this! You have no cargut to enjoy the hours of each day as it passes. But I am weighed down with life's many cares. Oh, that I were a child again I Why may I not be? They pass the hours in leisure, but I must leave scenes like this and drag lay weary limbs in search of a place to toil. "It is not the weariness that oppresses me; it is the anxious care. Cannot I trust Him that He will provide? I CAN. I submit to Him as my Parent. I can visit scenes like this, and others of different kinds of beauty, and enjoy them as a part of my legacy. I am a child again!"   , I started on, and having followed the path ] to another public road, I stopped at a house 1 Awhere there was a man working in the gar- o den. When we had talked a few minutes, he t asked me to go in and rest till after dinner. t I accepted the offer, and he accompanied me to the door. The house had an air of neat- 'j ness. The wife wasibusy sewing. Close by M her, in the, cradle, slept an infant. On a r stand were sundry cordials, and a cup and t spoon, around which the flies were buzzing. g On the other side of the house, on a bureau, st were some books and newspapers. On the e mantel-piece, on each side of the clock, were in some flowers arranged with good taste, and tanding in glasses of water. After a few M remarks exchanged with the lady, I chose a th book and commenced reading. A man who fo was plowing in the field, on the other side of ar the road, came to the door for a glass or cup sp to drink from. The ladsy waited on him with va such an air of sociability, that it was pleasing to to witness it. The same children I ha&-seen ha came in with some more flowers, which tool ce the place of those in the glasses. T he lady die then busied herself about dinner. The din- dry ner hour was spent as pleasantly as one rot might suppose. The home was a picture of sto domestic happiness, and gave 'me food for ant thought as I went on my way. st After searching four days longer, my bor efforts were crowned with success. There sho   em- was a carpenter living in the village of Sur., ing rey, about forty miles from the city of M- ate and not far from the river. Mr. Webster, my nms new employer, agreed to meet me at the uld wharf with a wagon to take my effects to ces his house, and gave me directions how to by- find the boat at M., which would come to the Surrey wharf. A delay of two days was neces. ch sary before my return to the city, as the boat lto that was loading did not leave the wharf un- od til that time. The most of these two day* rs. it rained, and the time was improved in be ril coming better acquainted with the family of Ire which rI was soon to become a member. ds The boat being ready to start, I retur ned ,ir to the city, arriving there on Friday after- re noon. Saturday was spent in taking leave e of my friends, and the next day was the last he Sabbath I ever spent in the city of M. It lg was spent as usual. Df  On Monday morning, one by one, as sny to friends left the house, they took me by the lo hand and spoke the parting word. When it it was time to start for the boat, I bade good- 's bye to Mrs. Cleaver, and the lady boarders, I and the children, promising to let them hear rs from me soon. My luggage was put on 8, board, the boat moved off, and I was on the a way to my new 4ome. In going each way, both to and from Surrey, I spent the time 's in examining the vessels and rigging, and t in doing whatever the men would let me. It I seemed like a  step toward learning to be a it sailor. When the boat approached theSur- s rey wharf, I  recognized Mr. Webster stand- y ing in the crowd. He soon helped me with my luggage, and in due time we arrived at h his house, and all that belonged to me was e placed in a  snug little room. There wad no other journeyman in Mr. Webster's family the custom of the carpenters in this littIe town being, that the one who had a contract would employ the others as journeymen. On Tuesday we started out to the house which was to be the scene of my labors. On the road I  inwardly renewed my old resolution to try to be perfect in the least as well as the greatest. It was soon evident that Mr. Web. ster was pleased with my workmanship. The evenings of that week were spent in becom- ing acquainted with the neighbors. Sunday came. It was the second day of May, and as lovely a  day as ever smiled ol this earth. Having made all thh preparatio for the Sabbath on the evening before, arose early, dressed in my Sunday suit, aln . spent full two hours in reading the Book I valued most. By this time little Joe came to, tell me that breakfast was ready, which, having been added to the many blessings re- ceived fromn the (iver, I walked out a short distance from the village. About two hun- dred yards from the last dwelling-house, the road parted, going two ways. At this corner stood the school-house, facing the village, and presenting a   side to either road. It stood in the edge of a- delightful grove, bounded by either road, and extending a short distance back. The grove, had been     purposely left for a play-ground. Beyond this there was a rivulet, which crossed both roads and led through a winding valley down to the river. The looks of the right-hand road being more to my taste, I followed it down to the stream, which was crossed by stepping from stone to stone. There was a spring from 'which the school children carried water, and at the fence was a stile from which a path led down the valley parallel with the stream. Upon this stile I took a seat. The rich car- pet of grass that was already formed upon this spot by a rapid growth-the road-the val- ley-the field--each seemed trying to outdo the rest in adding to man's delight  Looking up at the thick foliage of tender green, that made the school house grove the loveliest of all, I could not but count up  few of the blessings bestowed on man, to make this green earth of ours as near a para- dise as our own actions will permit: though many fall in the bloom of life, there is a lovelier place preparing for them: aid those who are permitted to stay longer, have good cause for thankfulness. . "'The month of Aprilpthough it brought *its sorrows, was a valuable gift;-a whole  month to enjoy life! This is the second day of May, only one day of the month is gone; that day brought its joys and sorrows: TO- D AY is given me to look on these scenes and  drink in the pleasures they give; if the whole month is given me, there will be  twenty-nine days more of life, and every  hour may be passed in the knowledge that  it is the gift of God, that He still remembers  mne: if some of-those hours bring difficulties along with them, they must not cause me to  forget the joys. How many troubles might a be upon me now if that Hand had not t] warded them off! Those fiesh, green leaves, n growing so thick upon the trees, find a re- n sponse in my soul: they are the word of God speaking to me, telling me to rejoice. n "or if God made so many little thinrs t that just fill a vacancy in our hearts, He 41 will provide the substantial things for our p: happiness. To Him we owe all: for I know tc that if He sends trouble on me, it will be to bi act as the cold wind, or the exercise which m abrdens me and makes me strong. It is not le my desire to always bask in his sunshine as I am doing now.             m "I will think of the troubles I have passed th through, and how they have been overcome; ga and now, being settled for a while in a com-l fortable home, with   many conveniences pa around me, and the opportunity to improve any time, I am inspired with feelings of devo- br tion and ambition. I am filled with pleasure. r These feelings can all be expressed in a few th words for future use:          thi ' Now Spring puts on her living green, And I'm released from anxious care,  8 I'll be more studious than I've been,  r11 see more pleasure than I've seen, in And as I taste the morning air,    Ev I'l spend the time with (jod-in prayer.'" ti   'd  As I passed a long time there, and no one th happened along to break the thread of my vn thoughts, I felt lifted above the considera. tion of earthly things, and that whatever ig happiness might be given by other exercises, ie the hour of secret devotion is the climax of m happiness reached in this world. m  Again the pocket Bible was taken out, and id while perusing its pages, the sound of horses' id feet and the rattling of carriage wheels fell a. upon my ear. Knowing it was nearly time r- for public services to commence, I closed is my book and started toward the village. I- Coming into the place, I saw people gatler. o ing from all directions to the house of wor- ship, and several carriages passed me. Tr Ihere was but a short time to wait after e entering the house, before the religious exer- a cises opened. I enjoyed the sermon, which o was more remarkable for the spirit of devo- L- tion than for display of learning, and doubt i not that many went to their homes that day, a profited by what they had heard. No doubt many made good resolutions before sleep i ing. 'he summer and fall, and also the mont  t of December, passed agreeably, and each e day-each hour brought its joy or sorrow rand carried its record to heaven. Mr. Web- ; ster s house was as much like home to me as any place since I became an orphan. For i that was my feeling still. When the bleak winds of winter whistled over those scenes which. had been so lovely in May, there was little that could be done, and my employer kindly informed me that he would not have enough to do through the winter to keep himself busy, but that he would be likely to need me again in the spring; and if I would make his house my home for the winter, it would cost me nothing. I could not bear the thought of living on any man. much less a working man with a family. After making him sensible that his kind. ness was appreciated, I declined his offer, telling him tlat I would look around among -the farmers, and try to get enough to do to pay my board through the winter. He then told me that the gentleman for whom he had built the large house, had spent all his money in baying material, and had nothing left to pay the carpenter. Mr. Hopper was a greedy, over-reaching man, who always tried to do a little more than he could do honestly. When he en. gaged Mr. Webster to build his house, he had plenty of money to furnish material, and pay for the building of a respectable hfouse. But his ambition was to do something brilliant: so he spent all his ready cash in material, trusting to his usual good luck for the means to pay the mechanics,-perhaps thinking it made little difference whethr they were ever paid. Mr. Webster was the. soul of honor, and, besides, wishing to do as he would be done by, he desired to throw his influence on the side of the balance forpeurr. Even when he was absolutely wrongei if there was any prospect of obtaining asi     rights peaceably by the use of patience, and if his immediate wants did not prevent it, he always went on the plan to secure peace. For he said " the less men's passions are worked upon, the less inflammable they will become." He had been remarkably suc- cessful in obtaining his rights so far; whereas others who had resorted to law had fared worse. It was his lot, sometimes, to come in con- tact with little, unprincipled souls like Mr Hopper, who would stoop to unfair means in their feverish efforts to be considered aristo- cratic. Or if they did not deliberately lay out a dishonest plan, the swelling of a mean spirit so modified their plans, as to necessi- tate a short coming somewhere. As Mr. Hopper sat smoking and swearing in his new house, praising his own shrewd- ness, and rolling in glory at the thought of being now considered aristocratic, he little thought how much of his satisfaction de- pended on the forbearance of Mr. Webster. "But," said Mr. Webster to me, " if you wish your money, I can get it all, or part, by paying interest." I told him I would  rather make it as easy on him as possible,  in his efforts to preserve peace, and if Mr.  Hopper would live on his generosity, with- out thanks, I would thank him, but decline i his offer. I named the small sum of money i that I would need from that time till spring, f received it that evening, and the next day r started in search of a home for the winter. t Though well known to the farmers of the n neighborhood, there proved to be none that t wanted any person for the winter.    t Once more I started in the direction of t] my childhood's home. Though making a a great many steps, the work of calling at every farm-house, made my bee-line pro- b gress very slow. I had been travelling sev- it eral days, when it came on stormy and com- ir menced raining; which, besides making my u travelling less comfortable, seemed to dampen li the hospitality that I had heretofore received. s Some people shut the door in my face. It w rained three days very hard, the ground be- - h ing all this time a perfect muck. It was very n( laborious to walk. In spite of all my pre- o caution, the rain would penetrate to some parts of my body.  Sometimes I wished I had taken up with a Mr. Webster's offer, and allowed him for it th out of my wages, but I had made a resolution w and intended to carry it out,-hoping the w experience would benefit me in some way. m Public houses were few and far between, and Sa even if they had been more plentiful, I could mi not afford hotel prices while looking for a ti place to work for my board. I had started with a supply of crackers to fall back upon, ar when not meeting with hospitality. I also to had some matches with me; and would kin- cu dle a fire to dry my clothes, which being HE done, I would partake of the food, and go to no some stack-yard to pass the night, dry and wi warm. This was repeated several nights. wi The rain being over, a keen north-wester nr(   nd blew all night, and on the eighth day of Jan- ent uary, the sun tose bright and clear on a ire frozen country. That day I found a home ns for the winter, with a farmer by the name of ey Deitz. I went back and informed Mr. Web- ic- ster of my success, but instead of removing as, all my luggage, I only took my clothes and ed the books I expected to use through the winter. n-  The next evening, just as the sun hid him- r. self behind' the woods, I reached my new in home, bundle in hand. I went to the barn o- and helped to finish feeding and watering y the stock, which was to be my occupation mi through the winter. 1i- While engaged thus, my thoughts were occupied with the peculiarity of the circum- g stances. "Man is made to labor; want is I- the incentive: but man is expected to do f more than look out for his-wantg: he is ex. e pected to accumulate. Though only a few - ccumulate, the aggregate of labor increases the aggregate of wealth. The labor'I per- u formed last year, makes Mr. Hopper a wealthier man this year; a small portion of that belongs to me, but he withholds it, and i, thinks he is shrewd, and that it makes him appear very aristocratic. "There is a time comes round once a year when much of the country is idle; that time r is called winter: some are so well provided , for that they can be at perfect ease, others, like myself, must find a place to do some service that will entitle them to their board; while  many suffer, notwithstanding the increase of the entire wealth." This thought occurred to my mind at different times during my stay there, and suggested an idea which became a practical lesson. Heretofore all my calculations'had been based upon the idea that every day was man's to be improved. This was true, but in a modified sense from that in which I had understood it. There are times in every one's life-as winter, old age, infancy, sickness, scarcity of employment, lost days from bad weather, looking for employment, Sabbaths, holidays, nights, and many more-that ean- not be taken into account when we number our opportunities.   , This had been a familiar thought to me many years, but never appeared in so stron. a light as now. My memory went back to the time when I first commenced to rave my wages in the city of M. When oalculating what my expenses were for a day, ard what my wages were, I made allowanceenly for Sabbaths, and calculated a large sum that*l might be laid up, at that rate, against the time I arrived at a certain age. Now I saw that the hopes of many a youth are based on calculations that are destined to fall short; and if they live up to thosea oa culations a miserable old age awaits them. Happily for me, my wants were few. I wa now able to bear the shock of adversity, do  without my wages, and become a partner with a peace-maker, on whom a blessing i - pronounced. I feltmyself blessed even whi!ef ' .:,:     thinking. Moreover, the fact that there are times when no man can work, teaches us to be the more watchful to use our opportuni- ties. The habit of laying tp for winter, develops the habit of forethought and economy, and has a vast influence on the destinies of men leading them to prepar? ror age, sickness, trouble, DEATH. When the Giver allots, to any man or woman, thirty, forty, or fifty years, it is not for those days to be. spent listlessly seeking present satisfaction. Every opportunity should be used to lay up for fu- ture wants; and when times come that most people consider lost time, that is the oppor- tunity to exercise Patience, Hope, and other graces. We shall all be judged for the man- ner in which we pass those precious hours, though we sometimes think them dreary. Every opportunity should be seized, for, once gone, they are forever out of our reach. We cannot do'to-day what should have been done yesterday, without neglecting part of to-day's work.  "Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof." And so with the GRACE that is given us. According to the advantages we have, much or little is required of us. If we do not im- prove our present opportunities, we shall not be able to do what will be required of us at some  future time, and must suffer for our inability, because it is our fault. This is one of the teachings of Nature. Whatever I   was doing, whether feeding, or cutting  wood, or making rails, or any other service, I aimed to have a subject on my mind to occupy my  thoughts; or the les- son I had learned that day, to repeat over and over again while at work-except when a new train of thougoht broke in upon me, or I  was carried back by the surrounding I scenery to former times. Cutting and split- i ting wood on the sunny side of the house, ] while the wind whistled about the walls, was 1 a  pastime rather than a task; and when go- i ing to feed for the evening, the streaks of ; light made by the sun shining through the t cracks in the stable, had a charm about them 1 that made me stand and think before setting to work.                 N The progress made in my  studies that f winter was equal to my expectations. Much t of the time was spent in the room with the I family, but when anything difficult was to be c done, I  went to my bed-room, and wrapping i myself up well, took a  seat by the window 1 and worked away until it was mastered. a 'While in deep thought upon the difficult t point, my eyes would naturally rest upon r the row of locust trees. in front of the house, a 'and upon the road that ran by. Some- s times when the weather was mild, I   would b go- out after supper and spend 'an hour. or v more in devotion, walking backward and' for- e ward on the dead grass that was thickin the front yard, or would stand and look up b through the trees as the night wind breathed s softly through their branches. These hours b were far happier han those spent in the iI   re ' church, which, though three miles off, I to regularly attended. di- At this time my mind was exercised on the parts that reason and revelation respec- ps -tively acted in'teaching us our duty.; My id reason easily comprehended some general n, ideas, which if brought into action, might 3, greatly change the aspect of the world, and o I was laboring under the mistake at that y time, that these ideas had been discovered t by reason. The great difficulty seemed to y be to put those ideas into operation. No i- way was apparent but that prescribed in the Gt Gospel. -  I then took down the following note:- r Reason gives some general idea of the whole - duty of man: Revelation points out the , particulars : Reason teaches us duty in its  rough, unpolished shape: Revelation shows e it in its finest colors: Reason hews out the  various parts of Solomon's Temple to their a proper dimensions, and throws them down in a   shapeless pile: Revelation erects the s Temple without the sound of saw or ham- mer. From the lessons learned since, im. stead of saying reason "gives," " teaches," and "hews," I would only say that reason is the witness which looks on while revelation does it all. And reason is a faithful witness if the passions are kept in subjection to the laws given by revelation, but advises wrong when the passions assert their sway. The last word Mr. Webster spoke when I left his house, was in telling me to write to him or come when I   needed money; but as I had been very economical in my .expenses, and as the rails were not made for Mr. Deitz, but for another farmer who added several dollars to my  stock; when I did write to Mr. Webster, it was to let him know that I was going farther, but did not need the money unless Mr. Hopper had paid him.  When I left Mr. Deitz it was to go on still farther in the same direction-toward the home of my youth, looking for work as a  mechanic. I went on foot, being encumbered only with the bag-gage  I brought to the house of Mr. Deitz. I stopped to inquire only at those houses which were close to the road; and they were few. At night I found a hospitable family that entertained me well, but could give me no information about employment. In the course of conversation, I  learned what had already struck my mind as being-true-that I was nearing the neighborhood in which I was raised--Mrs. Walters' house being only ten miles off. If I could get work in this neighborhood it would be like coming home again. I spent the week looking around, stopping with different old acquaintances, but could hear nothing of work;--there were more carpenters than could find steady employment. Yet I enjoyed the week and another Sab- bath came round. The friend with whom I ,stopped Saturday night was a church mem- ber, and gave me the oppottunity of attend. ing with him on the Sabbath. I met with   many familiar faces, the same familiar scenes, the same old Peniel Church: old times had come back again.  The preacher was a stranger to me, but the sermon was a good one. I returned home with the same friend. The next day I resolved before leaving the neighborhood, to take a good look at the old farm of Mrs. Walters. The people living there were strangers, but they treated me kindly and invited me to stay over night. I spent that day looking at scenes which brought back vividly to my mind, both the sufferings and joys of the past. After dark a long time was spent in devo- tion in the stack-yard. When in company with the family, the conversation also took the turn I wished it. The next day I started on, feeling glad of the stay I had had among my old friends and familiar grounds. My mind was so exercised on the past, that I kept on in the same direction, which led me toward the home of my infancy, which scene called back the days of my father and mother. Inquiries were made along the road for work, almost with. the hope of find- ing none. But whether finding work or not before I reached the place that held my affec- tions, my mind was made up to visit it at all events. Night came, and no friend to welcome me in; but the matches, and the plain provisions I had brought along came to my relief. Good weather was a blessing not to be for- gotten among many others; and as I thought of visiting the old spot so dear, I felt like one who expects to realize a fortune. Hav- ing partaken of a simple repast, the provis- ions from my bundle, and water firom a pure stream, I sought the shelter of a stack-yard; and having made myself as comfortable as possible, lay for some time thinking about the prospect before me, but was at last away in the land of dreams. My sleep 'was re- freshing, my dreams were sweet. After an- other simple meal in the morning, I started on, still happy at the prospect, still inquiring, but finding no work. Night brought me to -the Ball tavern, a where I put up as a stranger, which I really s was to the people, though not to the place. 1 How my heart was thrilled with pleasure c that night as my head touched the pillow, at ( the thought of being so close to the place I l loved I The next morning I could not resist o the temptation to look about the village be- E fore leaving it-perhaps forever. There had been but little improvement f made,-not many new houses, not much 1 business going on; but nearly everybody E was dressed in gay clothing; they seemed to b be trying to out-dress each other; that a seemed to be the race-ground on which they a were trying  their speed; though some c seemed to be only training.       V v I fell into conversation with a plain-looking h gentleman, who seemed to be all of the class r( he represented; that he-was a sensible man w was made plain in the first one or two re. ii marks. I asked him how business prospered It   Bs, in the village, and how things were going on ad in the neighborhood. "Everything is dull aexcept dry-goods and notions," said he. Ad "How happens it they are brisk when every- d. thing else is dull?"I asked. His answer ie will always be fresh in my memory. Id  "They have the fever just now; in fact ig they always have some kind of a fever in this ie little place: sometimes it is the fever for I dancing parties, sometimes for literary so- h cieties, then for excursions, then for meet. e ings, then for missionary societies, and now it is for dress. Whatever the fever may be )- they all try to have it the hardest. If the} y would take religious meetings and mission k ary collections, and then cool off to a moder- d ate effort, and remain so, it would be the g better for all. But whatever notion 'they Y take into their heads, it is carried to the I highest pitch, then suddenly dropped and e something else taken up. There are-a few [i families about here that always try to lead d off; and whatever notion they take into their eheads, they have money to carry it out. It - is ridiculous to see the foolish poor people t trying to do like them; they say it is better - to, be out of the world than out of the t fashion. So they strain every nerve, and almost starve themselves to be like their eneighbors, and to be respected by them, 3 which is the very thingtheir neighbors try to prevent. My plan is to take a stand on reasonable ground, and not move from    it, let   other people cut what  capers they please." This was a   lesson for me; I had always looked on the suffering poor as doing   the best they could under the- oppression of custom,   but never as bringing on their troubles by their own  foolishness. Finding out in this way that many bring   their own troubles, I believed it was only so in some little spots of the world. The gentleman said, moreover, that as he was a merchant, any one might suppose- he would be glad I o see them take such a fever. But he  preferred seeing people act with common sense, and  spend their money for such things as they needed most. It was fo the interest of the community at large, and of each individual, merchant as well as any one else, that people should do so; that he had lost a great deal of money in the course of time by trusting such people for the-neces- saries of life. Baggage in hand, I   again set out-now on familiar ground. The, interest with which I looked on every object may be better ima- gined than described. The body and mind both refreshed, it was with a light step and a lighter heart, I pushed onward to thed almost holy spot. But suppose it should be changed; the little change wrought in the village in nearly twenty years, led me to hope not. I   came to the corner where the road turned in toward the old farm. There  ' was the same -  house near by, the same bend in the road, but not the group of children. It was only a   short distance, and'I walked ?1     to the bend in the road, just for the satis- faction of looking beyond that turn, which mi my infancy had seemed like the vail that bides the unknown future. Taking a long tlokf I could see nothing mysterious-the charm was broken; but the thought came to me, that if I could only have taken that look when a playing little boy, it would have given great satisfaction, and the scene would have been remembered among those held most dear. Turning around, I went back to the corner, and thence down the lane. The -walk down this lane had more reality wi it than any poem I ever read. Every setp,added new delight. I came; at length, in sight of the house and barn. They looked as they did when I could first remember. As I approached the house, I almost felt as if going to embrace my beloved parents after so long an absence; but that joy was not in reserve for me. I saw faces at the window, I knocked, and the door was immediately opened by a young lady, who invited me in. - While exchanging 'a few remarks, my eyes sought for the old- time furniture in vain; things were in a different style, and arranged in different order. After going in it seemed no more like home. I had made up my mind to pass a short time there, Jet the work be what it might, and whether it brought me any re- ward or not. The object of my errand was made known, the madam   told me her hus- band was in the field, and would be in to din- ner; and as it was nearly ready I had better remain seated. The gentleman came   in soon; while at dinner, different subjects were mentioned, giving me some knowledge of events in the I neighborhood since my'departure. The prop- i erty had been in different hands since my g father owned it, and all the improvements 1 had been put on it by the present owner,  who was now putting in his third year upon a it. He  engaged me to work with him one month; that being considered long enough t to become acquainted, before bargaining for E a longer time. That afternoon we worked together, making fence.       I I I  was lost in thought, and was rather slow 1 at the work, making the first impression a p bad one.  Everything was so much like t home: it was the same  old house; though 3 in good repair, its appearance was not t changed. The out-buildings had been re- paired, too, but presented nearly the same r old appearance. The fences were after the d same   fashion, in bad condition, and the o fence we were working at was the first im- s provement in that line. The main improve- a ment was in the soil, which was now quite I rich.                  p As I  worked along in deep thought that I afternoon, I  drew many a. sigh,'and almost n wished the place were- my own; it seemed ti as if it ought to have been mine. Not that a: I   coveted his honestly obtained property, but the place (the scenery), was dear to my tl   s- heart. Every object in my. view brought h! back precious memories. t  At night they put me to sleep in the same g old room I occupied when I knelt at: my e mother's knee, and went to bed with her kiss. e I went to the same window and looked out t through the limbs, now bare, and triedl to e pray, but could utter no formal prayer. Yet i my heart ascended to Him, and memory i traversed all the time that had elapsed since o that night when grief first overcome me., The clock struck ten, eleven, twelve, and Ir still remained. It struck one, and I lay r upon the bed-still thinking. I felt peace , within, and a hope of one day joining those i who had left me so long ago, and who, I hoped, could still benefit me by their prayers. But my business was with this world a while longer; T drew the clothes over me and fell asleep. My sleep was refreshing. I per- formed my duties the next day with becom- ing energy, and all' the days following until the time agreed upon was out. Mr. Ransom expected in the course of a year to build a new house, as the old- one was getting  very infirm. He had learned that I was a mechanic, and that my reason for seeking work with him was to be upon the old home place.  He therefore offered me regular work until the time, and also the contract for building the house. This at first seemed the very thing most desirable, but upon due reflection my mind was changed. I saw he was maaking improve- ments, and was very glad of it; but to de- stroy the present charm of the place seemed almost like sacrilege. Though there was no one but myself who viewed it in that light, yet I did not take altogether a selfish view of the subject. I considered that there were many who owned property, but would let it go to waste; it seemed no more than right that some one should take it in hand who would make it profitable. Then again there are those who will not only make the land yield to them, but oppress' the laborers, and take profit also out of them. When the poor are thus oppressed they think it would be a just retribution, if the wealth should change hands. But sometimes the poor man when he is raised a little, becomes a greater op. pressoer than the one he despised; whereas there are some who never tasted poverty, yet from an idea of liberality will befriend the poor: such men are very scarce. Sometimes we desire to see the oppressor reduced, when infinite wisdom sees fit not to do it; and sometimes wealth is turned-from one to another, for reasons we cannot under- stand; it is best to submit to the wise arrangement, and be content with our lot. This I tried to-do; my father expected this property to belong   to me, but a higher Power had not permitted it. He intended me to have ease and opportunity for reflec- tion, but I have been oppressed and afflicted,' and compelled to bear it in silence. Yet I was happy, and cannot tell but that the ownership of property for which I had * k   anot labored, would have proved my ruin. While I submitted to the decree, I was still loth to help mar the present beauty of the place, though in the eyes of others that beauty would be enhanced. Neither did it suit me to stay and see it done by others. Moreover, it seemed to me that Mr. Ransom was of a grasping disposition, and would be likely to fall short somewhere; and it would be a deplorable thing, if I were compelled to go to law to obtain my just wages for build- ing on the place hallowed by the memory of my parents, and thus associate the 'dear spot with strife. I stayed two months, all he time becoming more attached to the lace, and more determined to live so I might join my parents in the "land of pure delight." There came to the house one day an old colored woman, who seemed very glad to see me; she made herself known as "old Aunt Judy," that had been a member, of my father's household. She remembered me well when I was a little boy, running about these very grounds, but I would not have known  her. She asked me if I had come back home to live. I answered her in the negative, stating my intention to leave when ] the present month was out. She told me where she lived, and said I must be sure to 1 come and see her before I left; it was like old times come   back, my face and voice ( almost made her think my father was alive c again.  I promised to go and see her, and 9 started for the field. The next rainy day t was appointed as the time to fulfil my prom- V ise.  When that day came   I went, and i took my  pocket Bible along to read to her, e but found she was a  good reader, and well c acquanted with the contents of the Bible.  She told me a  great deal about my father's p affairs, explaining how the property fell into w other hands, a mystery I had long desired to sf unfold. It does not belong to this narrative lc to explain that matter, it is enough to say a] the memory of my  dear parents became  n( dearer than ever, and I bowed more submis- eively than ever to that decree, which had tc made me  penniless as well as an orphan. pi She took out a  manuscript from a little bok, or and told me   this was what my father had, A 'left for me, saying it would be more precious cc to me than money or land, and that for the be promise of delivering this safe to me when I arived at the age of manhood, she and all her children received their freedom. She said she had kept it with great care, and warned her children to have it so kept after she was dead, but she- had lived in hopes that she could deliver it to me with her own hands. She said now, thank the G(ood Master, she had fulfilled all her obli- gations to the white race, and her heart felt lighter. When I  left she called down many blessings on me. The next Sabbath I did not go to church, but felt that whatever might be the contents of the manuscript, it would bring back pre- cious scenes, and become a  deeper devotion   n. than could be felt amid the congregation. "Nor does it belong to this narrative to tell ie the contents of the manuscript, only to say bt that by it I found that the name I had been it going by was only assumed, and that the s. name I knew my father and mother by were n only assumed; our real names and ancestry e were all given, and many strange things d which do not belong to this narrative. But o still more and more I loved their memory, 1- and new hopes were awakened. y The place seemed more and more like. r home, but it was destined to be changed, I1 and the neighborhood did not suit me as a e place to settle down; therefore, I resolved I to move on, that I might find a better place, and always/think of the old home as it looked when my life knew no trouble. IWhen the trees were in their fullest and freshest beauty, and when fields, garden, grass, and flowers were looking their sweetest, I started out, baggage in hand, to go I knew not where, and to see the place no more. I walked along witha sad heart, almost chok- ing with emotion, looking at everything for the last time, and, often turning around to look at the house. When I came to the last point in the road from which I could look back, I put the 'baggage on the ground and turned to take the last, long look. I  stood for some time in tears, thinking of the events that happened in my   early childhood, now and then breathing a prayer. The old garden with its flowers and walks, the fields and orchard--everything came vividly to my mind. I seemed to be stand- ing again by the stable-door, as I did that evening when watching for my mother to come home. I wanted to call them all back while memory was clear, and as- nearly as possible, live my childhood over again; but. when I   thought of that form which once I saw coming down the path, holding out loving arms, and drying my tears by her approach, I knew that I could not see her now, and, felt like when first an orphan. But with the hope of one day meeting her to be separated no more, I turned arund, picked up my baggage, and travelled on-, once more a wanderer upon the wide world. As I walked along, I employed my mind i ' composing the following verses which havs been fresh in my memory ever since. Wide is my field, to seek the truth, And find it out is all my care; I   sought it in the bloom of youth, And now the tree begins to bear.  But in the early morning mist, And in the early sparkling dew, A   lesson I am taught-'tis this- "Man's life is short, his days are few."  Man's days are few, so mine shall be, But they will seem as tedious years,  And many changes I  shall see-- Hardshipls andsorrows, griefs and fearw. Youth, with its fire, must pass away,  My riper years must follow on,.  ,;::.   . / :     ] must be feeble, old, and gray, Ere life, with all its .toil is done. My heart is shrouded o'er with gloom, I pine as doth the turtle dove, I have no place to call my home, No one that can return my love. And ypt I feel as minutes roll, ,   A satisfaction few can see; " The love of Christ is in my soul, '.   The law of love has set mo free. "The fields and woods, in verdilant spring, Give life and light to nil around;  And then, to hear the warlmerls sing  Oh, charming sight! delightfuil sound! I then forget my many cares. I then forget misfortune's blow; The scene my passive soul ins;pires. And joys, from many fountains flow. But through the limbs of stately pines, T]i: winter wind mnoans out to meo "IlWhen Inman the sweets of life resigns, Hte from its sorrows shall be free."' But ere I see my future homne, My soul must pass through death's dark gate And ere I know my lastin doom, Must lift the vail that hides my fate. That vail is the DFCISIVE MrARK Beyond which, mortal hath not been, I try to look-but all is dark, I long to view the final scene. , I did not feel altogether bereft; the manu- snript made me feel as if I had my parents with me, and by degrees my heart became light. I felt reffresied as if I had'really been to visit them at home. Thinking of the world with which I must nlow battle, I began to take a business view of things. I thought over the difficulties that were to be surmounted :--There was the selfishness of the world, which led some to deny ne shelter; there was the suspicion ' attached to any one in my situation, which led some to scorn mne; there was the vast  number of poor, and the few wealthy which made labor hard to secure; there was the 1 scarcity of money, which made it impossible 1 sometimes for an honest employer to pay  me: and then there was that "shrewdness"  of which some of my fellow mortals were l so proud. I had even heard people who  made a snow of morality, and who claimed  to be respectable, argue in favor of such i "shrewdness." They have even urged me to go on the same plan, as the only one by t whlch]l we can secure a livelihood.     a "And is it possible," I thought as I f walked along, " that the spirit of FRAUD has i such a hold on the human race, as to draw  k people in who wish to be honest? Let a others do as they will, I will starve before I n will fall in with it. I will work hard, and if c Faith in God is of any avail, though I may j be puzzled sometimes, I will never be com- a pelled to go by the rule of taking the advan- M tage wien I can, because others take the t advantage of me when they can." With u   these influences bearing upon me, and with these stormy circumstances beating in my face, I pressed on--hoping for better days. And now it occurred to me that many blessings had been given me in the past, and many were still with me. There was health, and strength, and knowledge of workl: there was Faith to bear me up, and the examples of others who had trusted in God, and not in vain. These blessings were present with me, and I compared them to a life-boat: and firmly seated iln that boat, I resolved to mount thie waves on life's troubled ocean, until drifted to some hospitable shore "Mount the' waves! moultt the waves mount thie waves!"I repeated to myself as I walked along; and ever since that time, when tempests have swept me from secure positions, my motto has been 'Mount the waves." As it was a busy season with farmers, I was not long finding workL, but I wished to findl a locality, where I might settle down with the hope of improving my condition by w+orkin at my trade. At the first place I ', stopped. the man engaged me by the day, and having employed me ten days, he gave me nmy wages, and I started on with the same motto fresh in my memory, and an addition made to it--that whenever Provi- dence led me to a firm foundation, where it wouldl be reaolah!e to plant myself, my duty would be to build upon that foundation,  and accumulate as much as possible for the future. And this was now my motto, 3 "Without a foundation, mount the waves; with a foundation, dig deep, and build." I continued to pass from place to place in- different states, looking for such a place as might suit to stop for life, and workling a few days here and there to pay expenses. For I did not want to call on Mr. Webster if I could help it, until Mr. Hopper paid him. This kind of life was not according to my taste: it seemed like a waste of time, and would have made me miserable, but the thought comforted me that God counted all the minutes, and was using this apparently wasted time to work out some good purpose; and it must not be considered wasted while He made use of it, although it seemed a blank in my life. My duty was to trust Him and though the man might- be scorned, le the dignity of the Christian be preserved by an upright walk. This thought influenced my actions-even to the smallest: one instance will be sufficient: while crossing out the ground to prepare it for corn, looking back upon the mark that had been made, I discovered several slight bends; this was because the desire to do ex- actly right, had not been in operation every\ minute; then I tried to do better, and suc- ceeded, by great effort, in doing the work just right; my conscience approved the effort and made me feel happy.  Sometimes my work would be with a farmer, and some. times with a carpenter; my mind was made up to do anything that was honest, no dif-   terence how low some might think it, rather than fall down to a level with such men as Mr. Hopper. Though Providence upheld me, I did not escape having many severe trials. These trials gave me the opportunity of seeing more than ever into the hearts of others. 'Ihllere are many acts of foul oppression done through blindness: the rich man sees only an opportunity to increase his wealth and respectability, and commits the act. thinking himself slrewd. The poor groan under op- pressiol, arndt see their wray hedged in; there is no hope fo' them but to suffer on. They think this an evil for which there is no rem- edy. There are some who wilfully and know- ingly oppress, who study out plans to oppress with more -severity; the suff'ering poor cry out, "Lord how long?" and the answer comrses, "stand still, and see the salvationSf the Lord. Malrk that man, see what becomes of him." Sometimes my lot fell in good families, at other times, just the reverse; somnetimes I received my wages, sometimes not. This period seems almost a blank, and seems to bear no relation to the other parts of my life. On one occasion, I had two contrary animals  to work with, it was a sore trial of Patience.  An ordinary horse or ox is trying enough sometimes, and the plowman Rho can wor -i day after day, and never lose Patience; who,  while heated with violent exercise under a t scorching sun, his blood rushing through his a veins, and then a senseless beast misunder- standing every order, can coolly arrange c things as often as they get wrong, must ha te both the head and heart of a hero. It is an t act worthy of praise, and the praise is worth  an effort. These two animals had been given o me to work with, because my employer could p not work with them himself. Theyhad been  in ruined by imnproper usage. After trying for b a reasonable length of time, I informed him  that more harlm than good would be the re- w suit; I had tried my best and failed.   te He took this occasion to fall out with me w and abuse me; he drove me off without pay- ing me, but as I had only been with him a th short time, I felt glad that the matter was so lu easily mended. While on the road, I re- a fleeted how much better mycondition was T1 than that of many who had families, and w upon just such occasions were cheated out su of large sulns, but could not pack up and dr go so readily. The habit formed at Mr. Walters', of '^ imaginilig myself in the situation of any one di that I heard or read about, was now of great en advantage. Besides the discipline of the  o mind, which enabled me to decide quickly vil what was to be done in any case, it gave me a measure of coolness and almost of stoicism, tow which prevented these things from weighing litt heavily on my mind.          J. As I walked along the road, the tedious- SOo ness of the journey, and the uncertainty of twe my position, were beguiled by singing some fef hymn in which a promise was brought to but ^   e  ,  ^^^^^   her mind--and when working up and down the as fields, looking forward to the time of reunion with my loved ones, has many times light. not, ened my labors. I now fixed my mind upon ese a certain locality many miles off, and set my ing face steadily toward it, with the intention of :rs. making no inquiries on the route. I carried mne provisions with me, and as the weather was ily very pleasant, it was not hard to find a-spot nd that would answer for a bed. 'The place was ng a long distance off, and as I had but little )p- money, it was necessary to walk all the way - ire  Once there, my intention was to work at ey somethlzng, no difference what, until my repu m- tation should be established for honesty an w- fidelity, and, in the meanwhile, watch for the ss first opening to. work at my trade. This' ry place had been recommended to me by differ. er ent people,who could give me no information )f about nearer localities. It was now the heat es of summer, but I pushed on with all my strength, for Hope animated me to make at great exertions. I But the heat compelled me to rest some  is through the day; and as night was pleasarLt to for sleeping, it was also pleasant for travel- e. ing. The difficulty was, that I could not see Is the country passed through in the night; e. but the desire to be settled overbalanced that. h As sleep in the open air was so refreshing, k -it took but little to satisfy me, and I had the i, more time to travel- therefore I could afford a to walk leisurely when anything led me into s a train of thought. '- The lights at the farm-houses looked very cheerful, picturing peace, plenty, and con- tent within. They almost tempted me, some- times, to turn in at the gate; but my plan was to keep on, and stop only at stores, or once in awhile at a tavern, when tired of my plain provisions. One afternoon, as I came  in sight of a charming little village, the beauty and stillness of the scene tempted me to stop and rest. A little distance ahead *vas a tree, whose thick leaves offered pro- tection from the sun, and underneath which  was a heavy coat of grass. There I sat down and rested, looking upon the village in admiration. My ear was sa- luted with the sound of the hammer on the anvil, and other sounds betokening industry' This might possibly be the place where  would settle for life. Whllile revolving this subject in my mind, the shout of many chil dren's voices rung out upon the air. Scho,  - was out, and they were free for that days The sound gradually became less andJess distinct, as if they were scattering in dyier- ent directions, but for some time the merry voices mingled with the bustle of the little village. r Four little boys were coming up the road  toward me-and after they had passed me a little distance, two of them turned into a  r pasture field, and, following a path, were - ^ soon hidden in the woods, while the other  two went on up the road. It was not long   - ' before the tinkling of a bell, which had beea * T but faintly heard, arld hardly noticed, became :M ' *  -"-  - A     more distinct. In a short time a cow came out of the woods; she was followed by sev- eral others; and then by the boys. The motion of them all bespoke freedom from care, and no thought for the future, as they moved leisuTrely across the field by the path to the bars. As I watched them taking life with as much ease as if the happiness of the present half-hour was the great etvent of their exist- w ence, I would freely have exchanged places with them. After they had passed me and reached the first house in the village, I arose and followed. Entering the village I noticed every sign that spoke of the character of the inhabitants, and everything made a good impression. As I entered the only public , housein the place, I almost hoped to find  work without going farther. If a pleasant  situation had been my chief aim, I would i have stopped here at once; but the hope of  bettering my condition was what led me to  look forward to a larger town.  The pleasant little village where I had i now stopped, delighted also in a poetic name. There was no opening for me to go to work s just at present, and I left with a sad heart c casting many a look behind. If I had been a born there it would have been myhome forc life, but my affections wee entwined around h another spot, which, though less beautiful, b was far more dear to me. Time, and much Iabor, brought me at last P] to the town of C----. Here again, thehotel ae was my stopping place; not only for the n sake of refreshing my body, but as the best p place to make inquiries. At this town, also, w; the demand for labor was snmall, or rather I the supply of men was large, but this fact u did not discourage me. As I had deter- a mined to remain in this place and do some- th thing until an opportunity should be offered to to work at my trade, I engaged at once with Mr. Dodson, the landlord, to perform the mi duties of hostler. The first thing I did after su having obtained employment, was to write au to Mr. Webster to send me my tools and ,na other articles. This would make me feel to more at home, and moreover, would be an co evidence that I was a mechanic, and help wa be to obtain permanent employmlent. Sev- fell eral weeks afterward, a letter came to my the address, from Mr. Webster, inclosing the wa 'amount he owed me, stating that although the 'Mr. Hopper had not paid him yet, he had into promised to do so in a short time. He sup- the posed that I must be in need of it before 1 this time, and stated, also, that' my chest me would .be put on bogrd at the first oppor- will tunity. Two days afterward, my chest of it  tools was snugly stored away in a corner at pur the foot of my bed. thre The same energy that had purchased for Serf e the regard of my employers as a me- top ohanic or farmer, rendered the business of an man hostler aIso profitable; for many of the gen ther tlemen, looking with pride upon. their ani- the Mals, rewarded me quite liberally.  the My situation was now quite pleasant. My Boor , .     . ,   ame health was good, my pocket was well-filled, sev- and money coming in more or less every ohe day, far above my immediate necessities. orm With opportunities second only to those I hey enjoyed in the city of ----, my mind was ath at ease, and my studies again received due attention. Though my mind was at ease, it as was only on account of the hope entertained ent of rising to a more useful position. Not that ist- I felt it a disgrace to do anything that was Oes honest. but the wish to rise is planted in nd every breast, and the ambitious ideas con' )se neted with my learning a trade, were inter- ed woven with every thought. he To throw aside the hope of obtaining the Od reputation of a first-class mechanic, did not lic only seem like making the apprenticeship a ad blank in my life, but it would have been like at throwing away a part of my existence. Yet, Id if I had settled down in that business, and )f married then in my twenty-fifth year, I o  might have saved some money for old age been saved many hardships, and studied at d intervals to my heart's satisfaction. But the matter did not appear to me in k such a light then; my ambition was to over- t, come all my weaknesses by seeing the world, n and work my way to such a position as would r command respect, so that my word might d have influnce, and my advice be followed 1, by reflection. I kept my name in for the next vacancy that might occur in the em- t ployment of Mr. Fontaine, whose popularity as an upright man was so great that he monopolized the business of ,the town, em. t ploying most others as journeymen. He was gettin g old, and my suln was rising. If I could obtain steady employment with him, b and establish a reputation wherever he took a contract, and wherever he was known, *the road did not appear difficult, that led to the fulfilment of my most. sanguine hopes. I had now been some time in the employ. ment of Mr. Dodson, when the freshness of summer was gone. The maturity of early autumn had been stamped on the face of inature. But my duties confined me closely to the towt, and the little of nature that could be seen in such a place, was all that was given me to behold. The ardent desire felt while living in the city of M., to breathe the sweets of nature, .had taught me that it was a part of my nourishment, regulated by the law of supply and waste; and the long intervals that had been forced upon me there, did not seem forced upon me now. There was, a lad who sometimes assisted me when much was to be done, and he was willing to take my place in slack times, when it was so that I could walk out and taste the pure air of the country. There was a hill three miles from the town, which almost de- served the name of a mountain. From the top of this hill the country could be seen for many miles around.  To spend an hour there was the object of my walk. I followed the public road for about a mile out of town, then took a path across a field, through the woods, and finally came to the foot of the hill   It was no easy matter to ascend the hill, but that once accomplished the grandeur of the scene mnore than repaid the trouble. As far as the eye could reach, the gently waving or more abruptly rolling woods and fields, could be seen in all dirrctions until lost in the hazy distance. Then by intently looking for a few seconds, one could distinguish the smoky outlines of uncertain objects. Not very far from where I stood, and plainly to be seen, were several vessels, apparently still, each one carrying the glorious Stars and Stripes. As I looked Ip and down the sparkling path of commerce, and then at the surrounding fields, it seemed a proud thing to be a citizen of a great country. My de- termination was strengthened to be some- thing more than an hostler. I returned down the hill by a different way, and passing through a patch of thorny bushes, that bear a wild fruit called the mountain cherry, came to an opening where grew weeds, and grass, and many kinds of flowers-flowers of every tint and hue of autumn. It was a beautiful day, the honey-bee was there gathering store, and so was the hornet, and the yellow-jacket, and other insects- - tasting now one flower, and now another, or  softly buzzing to tell of their contentment.  The scene struck me with mingled feelings  of sadness and pleasure; my mind went back to days past, in which I had looked upon t like scenes, and if stung by a bee perchance would run to her, who was sure to "kiss the place to make it well." The look of flowers to a child free from I care, is one of unmixed pleasure; the scene e before him mixes with all his thoughts t: tinges his play with its own lovely hues, M and in that frame of mind he paints the fu-h ture.  ' When he is older, and tedious duties are h imposed upon him, he passes by the same p place, or looks upon a like scene. Hfis duties t become more tedious than ever; that future he had painted for himself, when he had no * lo knowledge of tedious duties, f his beau ideal a of life; he longs for a life that cannot be of realized, and remains ignorant of the happi ness that comes from perseverance and .M ictory. Or it may be one who has lost a little sister, that goes to spend a while in the place ne where she played, to pluck the flowers that she used to love, and transplant them, as ot] she is transplanted, to a placewhere they- eve can grow up under more care; that the we memory thus cherished, and the tears made of thus made to flow, may draw the loved one fir into his presence, while dolnm the work fli pla Thus with myself: these scenes kept the the memory of the missing still with me, fresh cia as at first, and the place they occupied kin in my heart, was neither left vacant, nor hea closed to make room for other affections. as Whatever business might engage me, or Phj sorrows crush me, or hopes take up my of  outside thoughts, my happiness was to retire for,   till, often, as if to the garden of affection, to of pluck the flowers that grew along its walks, As and caress those 'in spirit, whom, bodily, I ng, could embrace no more on earth. ids, A man who has undertaken some enter- in prise with the hope of great gain, may also ing visit a ecene like this. 'Hiseagerness, his the anxiety, the necessity of watching opportu- Tot nities do not permit him to gaze thought- to fully on the scene; he turns away disap. tly pointed, and soon learns to depend on other brs recreations. But let him throw asideall he hopes and fears inconsistent with a full sub- the mission to the Divine Will; let him believe n thatthese scenres are made to draw us into le- the habit of reflection; that they bid us e- with an imperative voice, to forget, at times our consuming cares; let him believe that nt that same Divine Mind overlooks all our Ly affairs, and will provide for us, only leaving he us certain duties which are necessary, as a re discipline, to give us relish for true happi. )f oess, and then he can sefe the poetry of )f flowers.  Such was my state of mind at that time;  as the lessons taught by different events in my t, past life were of service to me then; and as - the lengthening shadows. told the approach ' r of night, I returned to my place of duty. t. Thus matters continued until later in the s fall, and yet no vacancy had occurred. There k came along a man who had no other occupa. n tion but that of hostler, and desired to be a, employed by the landlord. e  Mr. Dodson told me that my services had always given full satisfaction, and he desired ato keepme; but here was an opportunity to e employ a man who would stay with him for , time indefinite. If I would engage to stay , with him, andlook for no other situation, he would give me the preference; but if that. promise was not made, he would employ the ; new-comer. I did not wish to make the promise, and therefore gave up my place to , the man. There were several fishing-boats that be-!  , longed in town, and it was not hard to obtain  a place on board of one. This new business offered new excitement, and, being in good health, I promised myself much enjoyment. Moreover, it was something like a sailor'$ life, and therefore had an extra charm for me; nevertheless, I kept my name in for the next vacancy with Mr. Fontaine. We made several trips, and as in any other situation, my endeavor was to make every circumstance teach me a lesson. There were a good many to be learned in this line of business:-the habits of differenrt kinds of fish, which gave a knowledge of the best place and time to fish; also the customs of the fish dealers, the best markets, and the class of people that most use any particular kind of fish. My knowledge of the laws of  health was of use to me in this business also.  as well as the habit of strong resolution  - This was necessary to resist the inducements -  of my companions to "take a little more " ." for, if repeated often enough, they con      sidered it equal to the observance of all the laws of health. When sailing smoothly with the wind, it reminded me of one whose lot is cast in a good place, who is lifted up by friends, and placed in a lucrative business. But sailing against the wind, which required many changes of direction, was like my own life, in which there had been many turns. At last the welcome news came that there was a vacancy, and my name was in first. When Iconsidered all the plahs I had laid, and-the experience of my past life, together with the opportunity that now opened before me, my position seemed to be one that must yield satisfaction : the pinnacle of happiness appeared but a little way off. But for me, Providence had other lessons in store. No time was lost in moving my tool-chest to the scene of my future labors, and estab- lishing myself in my new home. I hastened to write to all my friends, with whom corres- pondence had grown cold, to tell them of my good fortune. I felt as if settled for life, entered with usual energy upon my duties, and with higher hopes than ever. As before stated, the reputation of Mr. Fontaine as a good mechanic and a good man, was spread far and wide,-so much so, as to swallow up the reputation of all others in the same line of business. It is therefore unnecessary to say that he was a pleasant man to work for. The members of his family also were agreeable. My fellow-workmen were many, and of different characters; but I met with no difficulty among them, which was not overcome by rules which experi- ence had taught me to apply.   My oppor- tunities, as before stated, were second only to those in M--. I had money enough to answer all purposes, so that Mr. Fontaine would be likely to pay up. before my neces- E sities urged me to call on him. My   situation at that time is easily de- z scribed,-I  was happy. I began to look 1 around among the girls, and though my regu- i lar and systematic habits did not permit me 1 to learn as much about coquetry as some of I my   companions of the hatchet and saw, my r love of company did not permit me  to re- v main entirely ignorant. It was at this time s the various passions of my  soul had their greatest struggle. I was passionately fond o of study, and also of company, when I found a the right kind; but the manner of my raising s had made me   backward, and being dull in r conversation, I  cared little for mixed com- b pany. However, my experience in M  --- h had quickened me  a  little, so that a new u world of happiness was opened before me, t though I  made many mistakes, which caused h my   face to burn every time I remembered sB them.                  n Though feeling myself among a  circle of is friends, and placed above the fear of want, A and in hope of still happier times, I could g not forget that I was once a helpless orphan, sf and had been beaten by a   larger boy, and cc durst not tell my  sorrows. The memory of i    e , this was vividly brought to my mind during the Christmas holidays, by seeing what hap- t pened to a little boy that wore rags for a clothes, and was carrying rags to the store d -perhaps to buy his Christmas sweet-meats. g  At the sight of him, a great crowd of the y town boys ran upon' him, tumbled him about , upon the ground, and kicked his bundle about the street till it was kicked to pieces, e -yelling out all the time, " rags for sale! '. rags for sale!"Seeing his condition, I went , and picked him up, brushed the dirt off his r clothes, and gave him such a sum of money e as would about make up his loss, and led t him toward the store. Instantly sticks and s stones were hurled at us very plentifully,-so that it was difficult to shield him by my own body. As we came to the store-door, two of t the largest boys rushed forward, and tried to drag himn back. I pushed the two boys i back, opened the door, and pushed the little * fellow in. A large crowd of men and boys now gathered round; one rough specimen came up to me and with many profane words, told me if I wanted to -fight to strike him, and not raise a fight with boys. I told him I had no desire to fight, but wished to pro- tect that little boy. Before I had done speaking he struck at me, doing no harm, however, and was going  to repeat the at- tempt when one of his friends jerked him back, and told him if. we were going to have a. fight it must be in the regular way; before I could interpose a word, a circle was cleared in the  crowd, seconds were chosen, all strangers to me, and myself dragged into the ring and told in decided tones, that it was either to fight or be rode on a rail. While I was trying to explain the cause of the trouble, a heavy blow was planted in the side of my head which laid me dizzy against the breast of the nearest man. He supported me   for a moment, then turned my face toward the middle of the ring, and asked me if I was ready.  Before I could speak again, the man who was in the ring made another plunge at me, and knocked out the most of my   front teeth. I fell back, bleeding and weak, but was caught and supported by some of the crowd. Some said I had been beaten enough; others said "he commenced it, let him take another lesson in the art." Then some one suggested that I should have a little time to rest. In the meanwhile I was spitting my blood and teeth upon the ground, and several handkerchiefs were brought forward i for my use. The man in the ring, who was all the time boasting of his prowess, asked me if I had enough; without noticing his question I said, in the best manner the condition of my   mouth would allow:-" Gentlemen, this is more like murder than anything else." At this Rome laughed loudly, while others gave utterance to execrations. One of the seconds, (but whose second is more than I can telD, then said :-"Do you 'mean you've got enough?"   *"That's what I mnca:" wag   the answer. "Why didn't you say ' nough' then?" demanded the hero of the ring. "'Nough," was the answer I then gave, and hoped my troubles were over. "He makes too much parley about it, Bill; I'd make him sing it out better ner that," suggested a voice, and a multitude of voices joined in the chorus, "Give him a little more! give him a little more!" I had by this time regained some of my composure, and saw that my appeals were received with about the same regard as if the place had been a forest, and the people a pack of hungry wolves. This led me to rop all idea of conscientious scruples, and ght as if with a wild beast. The thought of my mangled condition had begun to raise my anger, and now, free from the restraint of any conflicting higher duty, and with my soul in the business before me, I turned to my   antagonist again. Even according to their own rules, they should have let me off now, for I had spoken the final word, which according to their "rules," always ended a battle.  I had acknowledged my enemy vic- torious. But their love for mangling human flesh was not satisfied, and the sure knowledge that to pronounce the final word again would not release me  from my tormentors, made me- resolve to sell my life as dearly as possible. I  sent up a silent prayer for help. Whether my countenance showed any new  resolution or not is uncertain, but, just as my   antagonist made his plunge, some one 4 standing behind him said, " watch yourself Bill;" but the warning came  too late to do i Bill any good.  t His former success had 1 made him a   little too careless. Summoning o all my strength, I  warded off his blow, and h gave him one that leveled-him on the ground. t Knowing that I   was all alone, and must do c my best, I  planted both heels in his stomach, t and snatched a   stick from  a man in the s crowd; at the same time a  heavy blow was t dealt me by some one, which mashed my  M nose, and staggered ine, and made the day a seem like twilight. In that multitude, I was M little afraid of striking a friend, so I dealt w blows with the cane in all directions, and w made room to pass out of the crowd.    q Something struck me in the back of the it ead, and I   fell senseless to the earth. w When I    returned to consciousness, the offi- cers of the law had me in their hands. A st speedy formality was gone through, and I m was lodged in jail. There I  lay a few, weeks in and had nearly recovered when my  trial w 'ame off.                 if The interval 'was spent in reading the a dealings of God with his chosen race, and wl also the "precious promises" which are sp made to all. Over and over-again, I read the words, "Call upon me  in. the day of we trouble, and I   will deliver thee, and thou pl shalt glorify me," to see if they were really ha there, and belonged there, and could be con- thi strued in- no other way. They became my ha motto -for thih time of trouble, more em- to phatically than ever before. My miserable abc   Fh' appearance would be likely to make a bad ng. impression at my trial, and I had little to nd hope for but some severe punishment. kes  But I threw myself helpless upon Him, im  and plead for mercy. My trial was passed Ia off with but little investigation; I was only he made to pay a small fine, as they said I had La gotten the worst of it, and would probably be more 'peaceful thereafter. My counte- n! nance being now wofully disfigured, my re promenading with girls was at an enra  My if hope of building a reputation in that place le was also at an end. My fear was that my to situation too, would be lost to me, but'Mr. id Fontaine came with a pleasant smile, and nt told me if my mind was not already made se up to leave, that my place was waiting for it me. y  My   plan was already partly formed to to leave, but this seemed like a timely inter- to position of Providence, to save me from the ff suspicion and scorn, that would fall upon h, me while looking for work; and   I again a took my place. Just here may be a fit c- place to stop and reflect upon my trouble, n for with all my reflection in the jail, I could e not come to any conclusion. i,  I hold it to be the duty of every man to 3, whom God has given strength, to protect ts the innocent as much as-is in his power, and ?. to make any sacrifice, if necessary, even life v itself. The only point left open to doubt, is, s hou far the responsibility of any individual. e extends. If a  man made up his mind to interfere ) in every case, it would be necessary for him to have no other pursuit, except to occupy r odd minutes; and it would be necessary for 1him to have no family depending on him, that he might be free to go in, determined'to' conquer or die. An order of men devoted to the purpose, would be a   great help in some   localities, where the law-is adminis. tered by the worst men in society; but it would be rather a  weak order, if it demanded a   life of celibacy. The plan of mutual aid would perhaps obviate this difficulty. It would beget a  love of liberty that would be wholesome to any country; but when it ac quired strength, there is no knowing where it would cease to interfere. The subject is-- worthy of much thought. But in the case of any one man who stands up against oppression and outrage, many things are to be considered in measur. ing his responsibility. In my case there was no widow nor orphans to be left behind if my life paid the forfeit; but then I was a stranger among strangers, and any man who was a well known citizen was more re- sponsible than myself. For in the first place, his interference would have had more weight; in the second place, he would not have been likely to be handled as roughly as a stranger; and in the third place, if he had lost his life it would have excited more sympathy, and have led to an investigation of the evils which brought about his death. , ac, t     If one man's death does not cause an in. vestigation, the deaths of two or three will and it would be a glorious. death which caused a reform in this particular; for it would lead to a general reform of a great many evils. The only question for such a man to ask first would be, what would be- come of those dependent on him, and whether the sympathy awakened would lead to a pro- vision for their welfare? If it Were not for the death of martyrs, all the theological discussion-since the time of the Apostles, could not hold Christianity fuphgainst the rage of Infidelity--the gates But I had considered none of these things: there was a wrong committed before my eyes; I attempted to set it right, and trusted in Him for the consequences. The sacrifice I offered made but little impression on the multitude; the mob was regarded as a com- mon-place fight, and I was considered the peace-breaker, with the additional 'stigma of having broken the " rules" of " honorable" fighting. But that God to whom I offer a daily sac- rifice of my soul and body with every faculty, sees all that I have done, and knows my mo- tive; yet I ,suffered much, that it might teach me the following lesson, "It is not enough to stand up against evil, and trust in Providence, but we must use sagacity and attempt only what is reasonable, and not expect Providence to protect us so far as to remove the need of sagacity. We must by foresight evade the necessity of any more than reasonable protection from Providence, discerning from the importance of the case what amount of sacrifice it is proper to ^ake. This i's perfectly consistent with the idea that God will work a miracle when- ; ever it is necessary.  This unhappy event caused me much in- 1 convenience among my fellow-workmen, as  some of them made a great deal of sport  about it-much to my annoyance. But I  possessed my soul in Patience. I appeared I no more in public except at church, spend- i ing all my leisure hours in study, or walking k out in the country after night, to view Na- a ture, my best companion.        i One night, as the starLs were looking down from. the sky, I walked. out to the grove c alone, and-taking a convenient seat, looked n up at the broad canopy of heaven, through n the trees, whose branches were slightly i moved by a gentle breeze that played sweet h music..                r And thinking on the millions that sit in I darkness, I commenced to sing a missionary h hymn. I think I sung that hymn with the o spirit and with the understanding. As I, finished the last verse I was still gazing up p. toward the habitation of Himn whose name t was then between my lips. I still could, z catch a glimpse of the blue firmament be- be tween the tree tops, and as my own voice ci died away, te .wafaing wind again fell upon to my ear, and seemed to keep repeating what - ax ,l   in. I had just sung, impressing me with the ill, loveliness of Nature, and the sinfulness of ch man. it  Pondering upon that thought, different at kinds of scenery came before me,--all those a described by the poets, which need not be me- repeated here: but the last that came before er me I will mention if I cannot describe. It o- seemed as if a great multitude of people were gathered together; as I looked over al their heads, and saw them all in a kind of uf undulating motion, I thought of the sea. ty As I considered that in each head there was 3S rolling a train of thoughts, I was reminded of the stirring of the waters. I was so im- s: pressed that I thought it the most sublime y scene I had ever witnessed. But the wind Id recalled me from my reverie, as it groaned :e again for thie sinfulness of man. Yes, every e scene in nature is perfect; but man, the n- noblest work of God, is a sinner: and a e multitude of people, the sublimest scene on a earth, is marred by the thought that they are only sinners, only chaff and stubble. I continued to work with all my energy c- for Mr. Fontaine until nearly Christmas of r, the next year, by which time my money was - nearly spent. I asked him to let me have t somne by the coming Christmas, whch was t generally considered a convenient time to t pay old debts. Though he paid montlhly to , those who had families, there were others 1 who drew their wages irregularly as they r needed them. As necessity had not cornm- t pelled me to draw on him, I supposed it was e as safe in his hands as my own. He an- , swered me pleasantly, saying I could have e it at the time named. I worked on till all ) the others stopped for the holidays. L When all the rest were paid and my name was not called, I walked up and asked him if he had forgotten me. He said he had en. tirely forgotten me, and had no money left, but would pay me all on New Year's day. That was soon enough, and at the day ap. pointed I presented myself for payment. He tried to turn me off again with a prom- ise, and I expressed a hope that he would be successful next time in getting the money, as I stood much in need, the money I had before I came to him being all spent. At this he pretended to grow angry, and called me hard names, telling me to get the money the best I could, and that he would not pay me until I sued him. This seemed like hard treatment, and especially from him, whom  I had always regarded with reverence, as being a devoted Christian S His place in church was never vacant, and his devotional Spirit had all the appearance of being genuine. , When we see a man going through the performance of his duties in church, and see that he has the appearance of piety, we . naturally look upon him with respect ao being one of the supporters which hold so- ciety together; but when we come in con- tact with him in the world and find that he  ats upona the principle nf selfishness, -   grasps hard,to take the advantage, the feel ing is urned to disappointment,-it becomes painful to reflect upon it; but this thought does not apply to that man whose hearlt is the seat of God's throne, and who, going forward in the discharge of his duties, adds to his possessions by honest means; for such a man, in building up his fortune, does no more than increase the amount of property that is used to the glory of God. It applies only to the hypocrite, who uses religion as a means to answer selfish purposes, and prac- tices no more than he can help. The feeling of scorn we have for such a mean, is insensibly applied to the denomina- tion to which he belongs. Thus it was in my case--nas quick as I saw the hypocrisy of one upon whom I had looked as a pillar of the church, the church itself seemed less holy; but this is wrong, for though we might search out all and find the most of thei hypocrites, there will be one or two urm noticed before, that remain untarnished. They are the pillars of the church, and while they remain, the church is triumphant over every accusation. A great hindrance to the church is that men will make pretence; but the very fact of their being discovered, the fact that the world sees through them, is a triumph for the church, which declaresi that " the hypocrite's hope shall perish.", Another hindrance is, that men will hold I the church responsible for what hypocrites i do; but the very act of hypocrisy is a tribute t of respect, acknowledging the superiority of- n the church over the world. If the church could be relieved of the t weight of hypocrites, it might accomplish t3 more good, but ministers generally .eem to be willing to compromise with them for the w sake of their carnal things, and they get the w upper seats indeed, some of the ministers m are the greatest hypocrites. qThe world lo judges by the outside show of hypocrisy, se and true Christians are thrown into the back- ground. "Come oqt'from among them," or ce "Iet them grow together till harvest," here th are two commands, ad it is left to each su individual to decide for himself which applies for to his particular case. The clergy bend hy their rules so as to receive all that will be ha liberal, thls committing fornicationalsowith cec the common men of the earth.      all Now what to do with Mr. Fontaine was a wa question to be debated long before deciding, and I did debate it long. To lose all without to a struggle to save it, seemed like too much rec of meekness, but if it was His will for me to pec do so, I was ready to make the sacrifice. ber Mfany t houghts passed through my mqind on idea the subject. First, Mr. Fontaine was a fit to representative of a class'who line by outwit- and ting honest people; place such a man where ah there is no one to perform the honest duties mot of life, and he would fare badly; but while Fon there are others whose laqbor produces the in t] good things of life, he has plenty of tricks to usei secure them for his own use. It afterward -A caLme to myknowledge, that he^ had gained rem'   feel- his extraordinary number of customers by mes underbidding all others, so they could make 'ght more as his journeymeni than by taking the t is contract. At first he lost a great deal in )ing this way, but it secured him the monopoly, *add Ifs had taken he ay 'oe   Pv 1Y Idds and then he asked his own price, and grew uch immensely rich. At the same time, by no many little tricks which only cost him a rty, few cents now and then, he acquired the lies reputation of being honest, liberal, and a Is a perfect Christian. me-  If I had taken up my money by littl sums, he would never have stood a law-snt 1 a to prevent paying a small balance; but as . hna- was, he could make a good sum by playing a in trick; and then bygiving a small donation isy to some good cause, and making a show or lar more devotion, his reputation would be ess brighter than ever. yht Some of those who had been my fellow- eim workmen advised me not to try to get the r- money, as it was inpossible, and would lead ed. me into great trouble; they urged, moreover. ile that my name being already known as a er peace-breaker, would give him a great ad- he vantage over me. Ut Though I knew there was but little lama. he and no justice, I was firm in my purpose to( a test the matter, hoping that at the very least es it' would call attention to such gross violation L.2 of all ideas of justice arid civilization. Those [d people who thrived by such acts, were held es in great awe by their victims, and most of te those victims would suffer without a muL f- mur, thinking it better to escape as easily as they could, rather than attempt to expose e their oppressors, whom they regarded as h their superiors. o I felt that my giving up without a struggle e would strengthen the bands on those who e were held to the spot, because oppression B made them too poor to go anywhere else. I 1 loved meekness, but did not want to make it , serve an evil purpose. The attempt to get the money by law re- ceived but little attention; the costs were thrown on me. It took all I had except the sult I wore. The manuscript my father left for me, my own manuscripts, a Bible, and a hymn-book, I managed  to secrete before hand, and they were not taken. qThe pro, ceeds of my chest being insufficient to pay all, I was obliged to help construct a plan& walk on a back street to pay the balance :While engaged in tnis work, it was my hllt to be surrounded by boys and idlers. and to receive the taunts of all the "respeCtable  people that passed ljy, especially the mere bers of church, whose remarks carried the idea that I was a spoiler, who had attempted to destroy the good name of the innocent, and was receiving the just retribution from ah offenlded God. I attended church no more in that place; bat was told that ' Fontaine's devotions the next Sabbath, .were in the'jubilant strain that David might have used after he had slain Goliath.    - :Ater this task was finished, I spent the, remainder of the winter with a friend, who0 f^           f&T     sympathy for me arose partly from the fact that he too had been robbed by the same adroit pick-pocket. Though I desired much to leave the place, my spirits and health were not suflicient for the exposure of traveling in search of work in winter-time. The winter was spent in doing anything I could find-mostly sawing wood. My evenings, Sabbaths, and odd times, were spent in reading such books as were now left me, and such as I could borrow. There seemed to be no road left to me now to better my condition, and the desire to visit the Holy Land was the only hope left for me to indulge in' The most likely way to execute that design, was to go on board the first ship I could find, that was going across the ocean. I saved all the money I could during the winter, which was a' very small sum, and as soon as the weather was mild enough, and my spirits were mended enough I started out again upon the world, but not an aimless traveler. My face was turned to- ward the city of B--, where I expected to see ships going to different parts of the world. As I walked long the road, it was thus I mused: "Mine is a stormy life. There are storms of wind, storms of rain and snow, and storms of sorrow. We can build houses that will shut out the storms of weather, but I can find no place-no shelter, from the storms of human passion. If I take my ease, and let the storm have its own way, it creeps in by degrees, and freezes the blood in my veins; if I try to make my house secure, there comes a hurricane that overturns it. If I follow the customs of society, oppres- sion steals power, until it holds me by strong chains; if 1 act as a free-man, it treats me as  a criminal for resisting its authority. I long to stand on Mount Calvary, and in the a garden of Gethsemane, and pour out my  sorrows in the ears-of Him who drank the 1 cup of sorrow, and tasted death for me." I The little money I had saved through the winter, bought me all the clothes I needed,  and as my weary limbs dragged along, it did I not make me very sorry to think my bag- s gage was so light. But if I became a sailor,' c it would be a fine opportunity to study, and r the question now arose,' whether to pur- i chase any books, and if so, how to do it. v While doubting, and not able to come to any  ,better conclusion, I thought best to drop the S subject and let circumstances decide.  s After a toilsome journey, which was re. b lieved only by devotion, and the pleasure of o seeing strange places, the city of B---, at N length came in sight. I sat down to rest, p and to consider what to do when I entered. A My appearance 'was very unprepossessing, ti and any plan I could fall upon had some objec- a tion: so without being able to form any plan, ci I started on, determined to let Providence es dictate in the smallest as well as the largest in matters. I had walked but a short distance m down the street, looking this way and that A   It way, without any aim, when I met a man e as unprepossessing as myself. Confidence h seemed to enter my troubled mind, and I e picked up heart to speak to him. I asked. g him if there was anything to do in the city, told him my trade, but that I was willing to g do anything for the sake of living. He asked y me several questions, which were properly e answered, told me he did not know of any v opening, but I could make his house my e home for a few days, and could find out for o myself. t I turned and followed him to his house r Hisfamily were good people. That night's o sleep was very refreshing. In the morning e I started out determined to do anything I s could find; before night my efforts were crowned with success. I returnedl-to the 1 house of Mr. Ruth to let them all know of 1 my success. I told him I was not a petson to forget a kindness, and if he would permit me to stay at his house, he would not be the loser.  )  They all made me welcome. The work lasted only- two weeks, but by dilligent search I managed to be employed at one thing or another, until the beginning of sum- mer, losing only a few days. My spare time and Sabbaths, were spent in reading and de- votion. As I received my money, I gave what was proper to Mr. Ruth, and all went on well. My mind was now made up to purchase several standard works before becoming a sailor, but the sum in my possession was too small, so I worked on at whatever I could find until another month wqs gone. and I felt able to buy the needed books. Now was my time to look for a passage to some country, to, pay my way by laboring on the boat. The only point left was to try to get with as decent a crew as possible. This did not seem hard to do, as I fancied myself by. this time, something of a judge of human nature. After having looked around for some time and been refused by different ones, my eye lit upon a signal which indicated that the ship -was bound for Marseilles, in the south of France. This was as near as I could ex- pect to get in one vessel, and I sought an interview with the captain; he treated me very politely, and seemed to be a perfect gentleman-the soul of chivalry and honor. So pleased was' I that 'my old buoyancy of spirit again returned, and it was not long before 1 had bidden good-bye to the family of Mr.'Ruth, and had my small bundle, (in which were three new standard' works,) placed in a berth on board the "Margaret." As it was several days before she Sailed, the time was occupied in writing to my different acquaintances, and in looking about the city. The next Sabbath, in the morning early, Captain Seagrave had everything put in order, and the "Margaret" was soon moving down' one of the noble rivers of America.      THE SAILOR. T'HOUGH discipline had so regulated my emotions, that I was not alto- i[!D gether beside myself at the thorcrht of being one of the crew of a sea-bound af' ,vessel, there was a satisfaction which CtO made me forget the keenness of my past troubles. I watched everything that was done and said, that I might be quick to learn and obey a command. For a while the books remained untouched, except at the hours of devotion. As we moved down the river, I watched he ever-changing scene on either shore, but ny thoughts were mostly on the romance of the sea. The idea of a moving home that had within it the elements to resist the raging sea, was truly sublime. As I pic- tured to myself a noble ship, going out upon the deep, growing smaller and smaller, then out of sight, a thing of life amid the elements of death, venturing on unknown paths-to be a sailor was to be a hero. Between my duties I watched everything that was to be seen, until there was nothing but the shore now left far behind. As twilight came on  and the land could not be seen, I bade adieu to the scenes of the past, and felt as if en-  tering another state of existence. The captain seemed pleased with my tact,  and desired me to become a regular sailor;  but when I told him my object in accom- f panying the crew, his countenance changed. The appearance of the crew did not much f engage my attention till the vessel had started, it being natural to suppose the b crew would be after the manner of the cap- . tam. I had to be initiated into all the mysteries i of the order, and wrestle and box with their t picked men, before the stain of " land-lubber" vl could be removed. All this I took in good ix part, and they began to think me a fine t} fellow; but they were addicted to gambling and profane language, and other evils; and bl my refraining from such things was con- E sidered a reflection upon their morals. In m short, I soon found out that they were a bad fa set of men, scraped out of different nations, fe uniting all their vices, discarding all their an virtues. I was now sorry for having shipped, b; and formed a bad opinion of all seamen. I ve became the butt of the whole crew, and so tried my old plan of silence and patience, th but things grew worse and worse. I desired to the captain to use his authority in my by behalf, but he turned me off politely, saying  I would soon learn the ways of sailors, and w when accustomed to it would make one of the up best. They watched me closely in all I did, my ste devotions were made a subject of ridicule, I I  was maltreated in every way-even to blows. wa These also I had to bear in silence, for an ofi idea was fastening itself in my mind, that I these men were a gang of desperadoes. lan Certain remarks about the performance I hil would be compelled to go through on the saic \   coast of Africa, confirmed me in the belief that the vessel was a slaver. ted T'he captain was a model of gentility and Ito- chivalry, so were the other officers; but i, yht was plain that it was the kind of chivalry, nd which oppresses and enslaves those who are ich t;o weak to defend themselves. The cargo ny was also another proof of my suspicion, ng Guns, pistols, knives, and other instruments be of death wee on board; the other articles 'a could be left at other places where they pt might stop. I could now understand why the captain was so ready to take me; he sup. ed posed from my disfigured face, that I was ut just the man for a slaver, a fit unit for his ce motley crew." e,  One of the crew, the most sneaking man e on board, threw all mny books and clothes c- into the water while I was on duty. It was n hard to control my rage, but there was no n redress, and lno amount of punishnment ts would restore the manuscript left by my :o father. It was this that made my blood y boil; all the rest could be replaced. e  I longed for an opportunity to escape. 'e The vessel sailed into an obscure port on a, one of the Vest India Islands. I managed u to slip off in spite of their watchfulness. I - had but one suit, only a little money, and was in a strange country. But there were t, one or two comforting features in my situa- ; tion; there was little danger of Asuffering - from cold weather, and I had no load to carry. I had been so completeIy deceived in this first voyage, that I thought I would never b venture on a ship again. This island would be a good place to drown my sorrows. There were many pages of the Word of God recorded in my memory, and many comfort. ing hymns, which I repeated to pass away the time while lying in concealment till the vessel should leave. 'L'he provisions I brought in my pocket could be made to stretch for three days, but what should I do then? Most of the people on the wharf were blacks, speaking a barbarous imitation of the English language, and wearing faces of a still more barbarous expression. The few white faces to be seen were those of people of dif. ferent nations, speaking different tongues, among which prevailed a broken English but they looked like hard cases, and were very likely to be in league with the slaves, so it would not do for me-to tell how I came there. Therefore I had to fall on some plan to give the appearance of having been left by accident. I looked about in the low land near the water, and found a shallow stream where there was mud and mire. I went in up to the knees, and lay down and rolled in the mire, to give the appearance of a mis- step, and a hard struggle to get out. Then I went to a spot where I could get to the ' water on solid ground, and washed the most of it off, but left part of it on. In this condition I started towards the landing, and the first white man I met, asked hin if the ship "Margaret" had sailed. He  said she sailed yesterday. I told him I was * ' '     one of the crew, and while looking around on the shore, had ventured into a shallow stream, and found it miry. The appearance of my clothes was evidence to him that I was speaking the truth. He'directed me to the house of a wealthy man. who was a Dane, and had dealings with most of the vessels which stopped at that port, saying that he would be the person most likely to help me. I went and told the man the best story I could frame under the circumstances, being only desirous to con- ceal one fact,-that I had purposely left the ship. He treated me well, and kept me as a servant, requiring me to perform what ser- vice I could on the wharf and in the store- house. The duties were light, and my fare was very good for an outcast: yet in a few days I gave up the notion of staying in the island, and wished either to get back to this country or go to Europe. Thle next vessel that stopped was a Dane bound to Rio Janeiro. I told my employer that if he would procure me a passage on that vessel, perhaps there would be a better chance for me to return to the United States from some other port. He spoke to the cap- tain, ard I was permitted to work my pas- * sage to the end of the voyage. I managed to be quick enough to give satisfaction, but my state of mind did not permit me to indulge in any reflections: it was a pleasant voyage. I had only one suit, but little money, and was an entire stranger; yet fared much bet-  ter than in the ship "Margaret." During my stay on the island, and through the  whole voyage, I watched for some word  which might indicate the name of the island:  not a word was spoken, and I dared not ask, i for fear of exciting curiosity. In due time v we reached the city of Rio Janeiro.  The sights in this city were not altogether i unlike what I had seen in the United States. Having learned beforehand, by reading, what i to expect, and curiosity having been worn r out long ago, nothing struck me as very v strange except the languages. The upper- c most thought in my mind was my precarious s situation. Though in my pursuit of learning, I had obtained a slight knowledge of several Euro- t pean languages, it was only a few of the M words mostly used; these were pronounced c with difficulty, and understood only by close o attention, and sometimes repetition, so that  this jabbering of different languages which I n heard, was mostly, or altogether unintelligi- a ble. My plan was to wait in this city until d some opportunity was offered to return to fe the United States, or to go to Europe; and v while waiting, to try to get something to do cl n sight of the vessels, that I might be in- h formed without making inquiries, which ha would draw too much attention.     at Though not for curiosity, yet for advantage, m 1 would gladly have improved the interval in a looking at the country, and learning of its w customs and habits; but in my present situa- h tion, it was not likely I could learn any-   in thing, but what might be learned in books w of travel; and not knowing the customs e, sufficiently well to venture abroad, my true I interest seemed to dictate that I should work, and get some clothes. I obtained y work in a sugar house, and told my employer h that I was waiting an opportunity to get it back to the United States, and, therefore, n desired him to settle with me every night, e as that was the only condition upon which e he could employ me. He was either in want - of help, or was a man of humanity, I could e not tell which; for he readily agreed to do a as I demanded, and I had by this time - learned to distrust my knowledge of men. As I worked day after day, thinking of my e troubles, the question forced itself upon me v Where is my home? If I could be instantly e transported to any of the numerous homes I s have had, I would there feel myself at home. But, in fact, no one of them is my home; , where I now stop is the only home I have ron earth. T'he home of my infancy is dearest i to my heart, but the dear loved ones are rgone, whose presence made it home. Where they are is my home, if I can reach that happy place. But now I am a pilgrim, and this spot is as much my home as any other place on earth. Several vessels sailed away while I was waiting, but none of them to any port to which I wished to go. After some time a Portuguese vessel was ready to sail for the city of Oporto, and upon this I secured a passage. The ardent desire for knowledge which had led me to learn a few words of this language among others, was now proved to have been worthy of indulgence. Though it was spoken in the city, a knowledge of it was not indispensable, as the English was spoken there also; but on board this vessel it was the only language used  Though some of them could speak English, it called forth a laugh whenever it was necessary for me to use it. My attempts at conversation were so Jame, required so much labor, and called forth so much derision, that I never spoke when I could help it, yet improved as much as possible by listening. T'le crew and officers seemed disposed to treat me. well with one exception-a Tran who answered to the name of M-. His conduct was uniformly annoying. He was one of those little minds who imagine that all peaceable people are cowards, that a man's happiness is in distressing those around him, and that when he ceases to destroy the happiness of others, it is through fear. Thus it was with himself; he had been- very annoying to different individuals of the crew, but one after another had silenced him. Thus he thought of me-that my happiness ought to be in tormenting others, and that it was through fear of him I re- mained peaceable. He also seemed to be of a revengeful disposition, and looked as if he would take advantage to do an injury when he was not watched. He had mischief in his look whenever his   eye rested upon any of those who had chas- tised him, especially if he was in a train of thought; though when in conversation he tried to cover his intentions with a smile. I felt myself happy at the thought of having only one tormentor; and past troubles had so moulded my mind to patience, that I was not overly anxious to be relieved Another reason was that we would be sepa- rated at the end of the voyage. But experience had taught me that an evil will grow; perhaps the indifference with which his insults were borne, would be con- strued into a slavish spirit by the rest of the crew, and all uniting against me, give me a greater load to bear or cast off. So the necessity forced itself upon me, to consider what was best to be done. , There are ways to cast off an evil which end it at once; and there are other ways which people generally fall upon, that only aggravate the evil or substitute another in its place. It was hard to decide upon any plan that would be sure to work no mischief In vain I watched for him to meet with some accident, through which I could both show my bravery, and make him my friend. Every- thing went on smoothly; there was no oppor4 tunity for the display of heroism, except in the faithful discharge of common duties. There was among the crew a large man called A--, who was an excellent sailor influential, and understood English. He had always treated me well. I sought conversa- tion with him at different opportunities, and opened the subject gradually. He promised to aid me all he could. He managed at different times to have the three together in conversation, and acted as interpreter of ' those shades of thought, which could not be  expressed by the few words I was master of. In a short time the manner of M-- changed, i and before the voyage was over he became a warm friend. The satisfaction I saw on this voyage,  gave room to my old desire for systematic i study. But this time I had not ventured to t buy any books except a Bible, and no cloth- i ing except a water-proof coat. As the  climate was mild it was easy enough to wash p one garment at a time ; the Bible was carried b in my side pocket, and there was no need of 1 uneasiness that any one would throw  my r valuables overboard. Some of the sailors li had books, but 1 could comprehend so little b of their meaning, that the only advantage b they were to me, was the improvement in 1( the language.  I read the Bible a great deal, but even that fountain of truth sometimes grew taste- ai less-I say it with all due reverence--I could p not put in all my spare time reading the n Bible. 'hough it is a sea of knowledge, and al has been explored for ages, and new dis- o coveries are continually being made, yet the pv flesh would become weary.  The book of Nature, in which I had read ar much before, went far ahead of my calcula- an tions, and came abundantly to my  relief. ni of   is- The variety of scenery upon the ocean was of surprising to me, and gave me a new idea- he that there is no condition in life but presents I variety; and 1 believe a well-developed minid g could find variety and satisfaction in the id middle of the great Sahara. Ocean scenery I has been the theme of many a pen, but there d. is one scene which perhaps no one has ever a- thought worthy of description; yet to me it gave its share of pleasure. It was a ship seen n at a distance through a gentle rain. Some- bh times I almost wished to see a storm, Lut n- Providence did not so order it on this vovage. Le  One calm evening I was moved to mditta- a tion by the wide sheet of water, with the sly e outspread like a great awning, spangled with sr stars and olue between. " 'There is beamly everywhere," I thought. My mind patsedd h hurriedly over some of the scenes that are s, presented to people in different stations of y life, then again I breathed the thought, n "yes, there is beauty everywhere: He in. y tends all His creatures to be happy." The t: calm surface of the water and the pleasant e sky forced me to think of His goodness, His y protection, His love. Then again one day, iooking around upon r the horizon, taking in every object as far as u the eye could see, I thought, "'l'his is a world of itself, a large world-just what 1 can seo a at once; but beyond this, to the east, there , is another horizon, which also looks like a I world, and beyond that another, and another, - so in all directions, all over the sea and land, I stand where we will, we seem to be in the I center of a world. Yet it takes many of t these to make the world at large. i  "The eye cannot see, and the mind can not grasp a world like this we live in: much less can it grasp the distance between tlhe planets; much less can it grasp the idea of infinite space. or the idea of eternity. "We say the World,' and the mind grasps what we can see at one view: we say '  Eter- nity,' and the mind grasps but a limited part of duration." 'lhe idea is expressed in tlhe passage, "From everlasting to everlast. ing 'Thou hrt (nd." At the first thought we imragin ll e has existed ever since a period a long time back; the mind travels back to that mnagiinary period, and we find he had still existed before that; the milin reachLe out again, travels back to what seeimi. like a beginning, but He had still existil before. It reaches back again and aguili. but every time it stops to take breath anil looks beyond, the beginning is still iln tliu distance: it is still "t from everlasting.'  "In the beginning God created the heavein and the eartl ;" when did Hfe create? at i, period called "  the beginning." Why did lie not create before? there was an eternity tlas already. If He had created many ages  m.. fore, there would still have been an eternity. past. If there was an eternity before thi;t period, it was as much the end of eternity a.4 any other point we can imagine; if there is an eternity to come, this is as much the egiu- ning as any other moment we can imagine.     Millions of ages .from now, the eternity past will be no greater, the eternity to come will be, no less. If a thousand ages were added to eternity, it would be no longer, if taken from it, it could be no less. If the Self-Existent had created a thousand years sooner, the time before creation would have been no shorter, if a thousand years later that time would have been no longer. Time is no quicker come than gone. The past is not, the future is not, the present is the point where the past and future meet. Eternity is a continued NO IV. As the scope of vision from any point seeins like a world of itself, so each moment is a miniature eternity, capable of being divided into an infinite nuzmber of parts, each part a com- plete NOW. The ship sailed on, touching at different islands, but I did not venture any distance  on the land, contenting myself with what I could see while remaining near the vessel. So I made no observations of any interest. Land again made its appearance, dimly seen at first, but gradually rising up out of' the ocean, and objects becoming more and more distinct. All stood looking for some time, making observations about their friends at home, when one of the sailors, as if proud of his country, struck up one of their national songs: one after another joined in, till nearly the whole crew had united, and as their strong voices rolled out upon the waters, my very soul rejoiced that there was such a thing as nationality to unite men as brothers. True, nations go to war, and war is a terrible evil;  but it is small compared with what might be, s if the bonds that unite a  nation were dis- E solved, and families, and factions, were left I to struggle promiscuously-subject to no I government.                1 The city of Oporto appeared in sight, and s thefeeling that animated all the rest was 1 imparted to me. I  almost felt as if returning i home: there was certainly little feeling as if  among strangers. I  could think of the home r of my childhood, and the looks of the old E h4use; and called back the days when my father petted me, and my  mother kissed me. r This gave me  pleasure: so when I thougllt i of all the places that had been Imy residence, t some more, others less. But I had ceased to v regard any part of the earth as, a  desired c pot, except that land once blessed with the t resence of Himin,-now bearing His-curse d shall I  say? no; only His flown. I now a yearned to set my feet upon that holy t ground, and for many precious reasons.  li The ship landed. I  was actually upon the n soil of Europe. It was hard to realize it, and in spite of all my efforts I could not fcei ay myself a  stranger. There was no place on b earth that seemed any more like home  than w the spot where I  stood. The people of that tl country had treated me well, and it seemed or as if every face I met was full of sympathy. or This was only imagination, but it added greatly to' my happiness. Though I   still m spoke the language very badly, the confi do   y ' dence I felt seemed to utter itself .n my man. ie ner, for every one I spoke to answered me as re well as I could wish. This may have been f only imagination too, for I looked well at any le one before deciding how to speak, and the rs good impression already made may have e blinded me to some frowns actually given. , Itf so, then " ignorance was bliss." It took but little to make a good impres- e sion on a wounded spirit like mine. Many s people. in the sunshine of life, have burst ;. into fits of anger, or acted out " injured in. e nocence," at far lighter inconveniences than d were suffered by me on that voyage. But I e thought myself happy. The plan to be pur. n sued now, was to obtain employment in some - store-house, or to help load vessels, or some- thing of the kind, till an opportunity was t offered to get nearer to the desired country. e  The opportunity to labor did not present I itself every day, and at times when there was nothing likely to be done in which I could take part, I would look about the cit'y, and r sometimes go a distance into the country. It was wearing late in the fall, the busiest season was over, but there was enough to be X seen and enough  to admire. The pleasant scenery, the expression  of some of the dwellings and their surroundings, the sooth- ing influence of the climate, combined to make me   feel at home. Though some of the customs were strange, and the every-day sights resulting from them were new, they did not seem out of place; there appeared to be a  fitness, a proof of common sense, in everything I saw, and my  mind had become so accustomed to seeing things done differ- ently from my childish impressions of the proper way, that everything had an air of familiarity.  But it would not do to venture too often, nor too far away; besides the de- sire to miss no opportunity of sailing, it was best to work as much as possible to prevent getting short of money. After some time, a vessel was announced to sail for the AMediter- ranean, stopping at a  number of ports, and going as far as Alexandria. I had made the acquaintance of several men of influence, each of whom had prom- ised to intercede for me if the captain refused to hearken to my   request. So, it was not without confidence I .undertook my own cause, the confidence being increased at the thought of my experience as a  sailor. It did not require much pleading. Sea captains are nothing loth to have'an extra man or two, especially in the stormy. season. A little was added to my stock of clotlhing, but not enouglh to be an incumbrance. I  still had no book but the pocket Bible, and what I had made of a diary since my books were thrown overboard. This diary was little more than a record of some of my thoughts. of which many were expressed only in words enough to help the memory, on which I mostly depended. The voyage in the Mediterranean occupied more time than a  much longer one sometimes does, where there are not so many stopping   ilaces. Wherever we stopped I went on -shore, the main object being to set foot on land in so many countries. But I was too nauch occupied with the prospect of seeing Palestine, to indulge in any thoughts of the countries where I stopped. What I saw was an advantage to me, but I could give no de- scription that would enlighten any one's mind who has read books of travel. Yet I may have occasion to mention some of these places, incidentally, in the future lectures. It will be proper, therefore, if I now tell only wliat befell myself. For the same reason, though this was the roughest voyage I had yet seen, and though we had quite a storm on one occasion, were I to give a lengthy de- scription of that storm, it would not compare with some descriptions I have read, and which are within the reach of all. Therefore it would not interest the intelligent reader. My emotions found expression in a few verses at the time, but as I have only a Tagged remembrance of them, they will be permitted to rest: for I must confess to being a little selfish; not even the sublimity X of the ocean has impressed itself upon my  1 memory   like my -own  sorrows. Those 1 thoughts which were impressed upon me by I the millstone of sorrow, were the clearest in my memory whether expressed in plain sen- I tences or verse.  The emotions from a storm I were not as terrible as I   had imagined, s though  this was from  the fact that the d danger was not as threatening as in cases s of which I had read.            u Yet the dashing of the sea gives a stronger M impression of the power of God than a long fE study  on the word "OMNIPOTENT," and a ti more practical sense of our weakness than the  most eloquent sermon, or  the most n humble prayer. Landsmen look upon sailors b as a God-forsaken class, but "They that go rn down to the sea- in ships, that do business in tl great waters, these see the  works of the m Lord, and/lhis wonders in the deep."    be There is a lesson in every wave, and if the B mind is permitted to follow the corpse that to is committed to the deep, till it reaches the sh plane where it Inust rest until the power qu thalt raised up Jesus is again exercised, the fo impression will be  deeper than that pro- de duced by' any sermon it ever was my   privi- be  ge  to hear. These impressions are not he lost on  sailors; thoughl there are some wicked men among    them, whose influence I  checks the rising thoug'llt, that might lead an to selrious and profitable conversation. yet as ve a  claas they are not bad hearted men. to They make little ado about orthodoxy, and ac are unguarded in their manner of speech; wi but they are as open to good impressions as aff any   other class of people (except little coi children): and  there is Inany a  iman and ne woman  who   would consider it a horrible so( crime   to miss going to church on a rainy an Sunday, who is a  worse sinner at heart than me the average "jolly sailor boy."      hin My   first impression of sailors was a bad has one; but experience, the best of teachers, tieo 4 '            ..   s   on' soon taught me better. CaptainC---  with on whom this voyage was made, was the mowt too stern, and dignified of any I had yet seen, ng and was inclined to be a little overbearing. she Being the master spirit of the vessel, as well as as t  he  st in rank, his individuality was de- stamped upon the officers, Yet there was e's very little trouble on board; things gener. I ally worked smoothly enough. Sometimes se a man would show in his countenance that It it was policy rather than inclination that ly led him to obey, yet there never appeared n, anything like insubordination. As for mej Id my shipmates on board this vessel gave me m no unusual trouble,--only those little in- e- conveniences which cannot be avoided. re Patience and kindness did the work for mo. d  It did not take me long to find out that re I was to say nothing to the officers except to give the proper answer, both in word and w action.  I  did not begrudge them  their a customary respect, and I considered all on e board my   servants just as far as I needed o them. My object was to get to Alexandria, y and it gave me the same satisfaction to see ythe progress of the noble ship, as if she had e beenfitted out and had sailed for my special ybenefit. n  Science and the dexterity of the sailors - had also been made to contribute to my pleasure; they steered the ship to the de- , sired point, and under the blessing of Provi. dence, landed me   in the city. I could not 3speak the language of the country, but there were strangers of different nations there with whom I could converse, and I felt no fear of difficulty in carrying out my inten- [ tions. As the Jews were among the most promi- nent merchants, my first inquiry was for the business place of some individual of that race. It was for this and other reasons that the study of their .language had occupied much of my  spare time. It was not long before I  found myself face to face with a Mr. B---. I introduced myself as one desiring to visit the Holy City. He looked at me sharply, and asked me some very annoying questions, evidently to find out my motive for wishing to visit that place which was so dear to himn; as much as to say there could be no sympathy between us, that he should help me to visit the home of his fathers. It was no use to try to evade his questions; I   had to tell him plainly that I was a Jew, and "wishled to visit the place out of pur veneration for the Holy-City. [  did not wisk.. to tempt Providence by venturing into such a   country as the Holy Land is in these times, without some such protection as would be afforded by going as a   citizen of some country, or the friend of some business man.  The uncertainty of any chance to go soon except through his kindness, and th6 anxiety to get there as soon as possible, led me to urge the matter very strongly with him, as if it had been my only hope. It was hazardous to give the last piece of informs. tion, for an apostate Jew is the most despised     of all creatures, among those who claim to be, and certainly are, a peculiar people. But I had embarked in a hazardous enter- prise, and being tossed upon the tempestuous sea of life, had lashed my body securely, determined not to lose hope while scudding before the storm. My hope was that the lapse of centuries had cooled the passions of the Jews against "The Innovator " and His followers, but in this I was doomed to dis- appointment. The prejudice exists in many f their minds as strongly as ever. He gave me another scrutinizing look, as if to de- termine the cast of my'features-he was evidently puzzled by their scarred condition. He required me to explain why I spoke the language so imperfectly. This was done according to the information he received from the manuscript my father left me. "Then your father left his people and be- came an apostate?"I answered that my father visited the land with true devotion and was all his life a firm believer in the final supremacy of Israel; though at different periods of his life he believed it for different reasons. "And what did he teach you would be the cause of Israel's triumph over her oppres- sors?" "He died before I was old enough to be taught anything about it. All I know about his faith is from a manuscript he left in the care of a family servant, to be given me when I became of age. A helpless or- phan, raised among strangers, I grew to be a man before a father's instructions were given me." He paused and looked at me.  I had  evaded the necessity of telling him about my i father's doubts and perplexities on the sub-  ject of religion, his final decision and conse- i quent movements; and I hoped he would I not plainly ask me about my faith. I was t liberal in my sentiments, belonged to no re- i ligious denomination, and did not try to im-  pose my faith upon others. The exercise of Faith is my spiritual appetite, and my creed  has been given me in the same manner as c my daily bread; I believed that the dealings I of the leacher with each individual soul, t would be more convincing than any attempt g at argument: that He who had led me was able to lead others also, and therefore con- h tented myself with arguing by actions, and s with such professions as became necessary g in the order of Providence.       b When he had surveyed me a few seconds, a he said, "Then you were raised among c Christians?"               "The man who raised me was more like I a heathen than a Christian," I answered. e This seemed to please him. "  Were you t left free to form your own opinions?" he tE asked,    '"I had no restraint, and received but little teaching," was the answer.    n "Then I suppose you believe in no God is but Nature."              of , "I worship the God of Abraham, Isaac,    ;o and Jacob. My disfigured face, which causes the world to look upon me as a vagabond. r- is but a proof that the Potter has made me is a vessel of dishonor. Yet I adore Him." ,  He looked at me with interest and pity g both manifested in his countenance. "Yes," e said he, "the world has used you roughly f like all our race; I suppose you desire to s return to your people, and become one of 3. the circumcised." My answer was, "I love y my people; I am already circumcised ia e heart, it is good for me that I have been - afflicted." s  He then said, "It is necessary for God's people to be distinguished from the world by 3 some visible sign." "The visible sign,"  e answered, " is to act on the principle of Love i the world is entirely selfish. This is a more separating sign than any mark of the body, which leaves the soul unchanged." "Our Law-giver commanded many things," , said he, "which you have nlot yet learned;. i it is necessary: for all to observe them, whether in our own land, or scattered among, the nations: Israel must be a distinguished; people."  My answer was, "I am convinced that out. ward observations are of no account; he' that is a Jew, must be one inwardly,-must be circumcised in heart; to all such the God, of Israel will listen, and He will answer prayer as distinctly as if they had consulted the Urim and Thummim. I am a Hebrew of the Hebrews, and carry the mark of His love in my forehead: whom He 16veth, He chasteneth." This reference to departed glory, stung the old man to the quick. His manner changed instantly;-" tell me plainly," said he, " are you one of those that wait, or are you a be- liever in the Impostor?" The word "im. postor" stung me also; it was the first time the word had been thus applied in my hear- ing, but my answer was in adl-Ocalmness. "'There have been a number bfimpostors, who clamed to be the DELIVERER, but I be- lieve in none of them." "Then you are one of those that wait." "I do wait, and Hope, but I do not expect the Deliverer till there is FAITH, in Israel to give Him  a glorious reception."      ' "My son. you wrong your people, Israel has Faith, Israel waits in Hope: but qllhave sinned, and must bear our punishment with great resignation. The darkest howx. ju st before the dawn ; this is the longestif ction, and the hardest our race has ever"Suiffered certainly we have suffered nearly all that our Law-giver threatened, and I almost think I can see the first dawn. The Sun of right- eousness cannot "delay much longer." As the old man spoke, his eyes glistened with tears, the hard face lost its hard expression, and I took courage to speak. "Bear with me, my father, while I give my opinion; all Jews do not think alike. It is true Israel has sinned, but it is not the sins of former generations for which we suffer now, and for which the whole creation As   fers; it is the repeated sins of this genera. tion. "God trained Israel up as his child, He gave him lessons in Faith, and our people grew in Faith, so that some could call down fire from heaven. When our Law-giver talked with God, our fathers believed; when God revealed Himself to any person of great Faith, the people believed; but when the samne Jehovah who talked with Moses in Sinai, laid aside the terrible majesty that made the multitude tremble, and revealed Himself in a lovely Form, Israel's Faith failed. He was of a servile spirit, and could not believe in a God that did not excite terror. "This was the great TRIAL OF FAITH for 'lich Israel had been so long in prepara- ;on. God had revealed His power, His ven- geance, His mercy, His wisdom, His holi- ness, and the crowning revelation was to be His LOVE. He revealed Himself to our fathers in a FORM to excite Love, to beget confidence, to drive away terror of every kind: but the rulers of our people believed in terror and majesty, and if the great Con- querer and Deliverer would associate with the common people, and suffer as one of them, it destroyed the dignity of the rulers at one blow' Then if He was to commence his series of conquests, by destroying the power which they had wickedly acquired over the flock of God, He was their enemy, and they set about to conquer Him. "And then in Jerusalem  and all the country about, was fought the greatest battle en record. On the one side was Jehovah in a lovely Form, claiming his right to rule by the Law of Love, and using his power to banish all terrors. On the other side were the usurpers, who, clothing themselves with the majesty of God, claimed the right to rule by terror. "The weapons used were, on the one side Love, on the other side terror. They took the unresisting Form of Love, subject to the same laws as our own bodies, and gave vent to their rage, until that Form had suffered all that can be suffered in the body, and was relieved by death.  "Then the power of Love in Jehovah ] raised up the same Form, now capable of suffering no more. le had borne all the  consequence of sin, which is suffering and  death, and He could now suffer and die no  more. He was victorious. "Israel had not yet sufficient Faith to re-  ceive Him, and He left the earth until  Israel's Faith should be exercised yet more, and when He finds Faith on earth, He says He will come again in the same manner as 1 He went, and to the very same spot where 1 He left.  "  But though his visible Form is not pres.  ent, his influence is with us, and operates ( on every heart; for He said, 'I will send the i Comforter.' That Comforter is Himself  working invisibly, but He says He will come  again visibly, and show Himself to every a person. Rev. i. 7.   "The punishment of the Israelites is foi- the good of the world j when they get tired of waiting for the Deliverer to come with terror, they will accept Him in the Form of Love; then He will come and restore Israel to power; that power will be Love, and all the world will be blest by Israel's restora- tion. Rom. ii. 15. "Some of the nations now accept Him as their King, but they have very little under- standing about it; his most zealous followers were so anxious to convert the world, that they let go the points requiring the most vivid Faith, and the Faith of his followers has become weaker and weaker, until it has degenerated into a number of contradictory systems of morality; having no particular OBJECT of Faith, except that those who do, right will be happy, and those who do wrong will be miserable. "The nations of the earth are like little islands of sand; every tide changes their shape, runs two or three into one, destroys one and washes up another. But Israel is a. rock. He has stood the shock of centuries. No revolutions, nor contending factions, nor great calamities, can change the form of Israel. He is still the Lord's beloved, but by his continued obstinacy, is daily bringing upon himself the chastening rod. It is the hand of Love that wields it; the Father longs- to throw it down, and rule his son with pure and undefiled Love. 'But Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider."' The old man's countenance changed many times as I spoke, and he would have inter. rupted me several times, but I motioned himb to let me proceed. It was the dearest sub. ject upon which I could speak, the centre around which all my thoughts revolved. And now, being permitted to express myself for the first time to a living hearer, it gave me a pleasure never felt before. I had pur- posely evaded giving him a direct answer, that I might have the opportunity to utter my sentiments; and now having spoken for Him, I felt ready to die if it was His will. Nor did the flashes of anger that came to his eyes give me any alarm. They taught me a lesson,-that many of Israel are still prejudiced as strongly as ever, but are a lit. tle more reserved with their violence. The hand of God is at work. Providence will lead them by a way they know not, arnd place them where, perhaps, they might have stood centuries ago. The old man put on a severe countenance, and spoke with bitter- ness. "Then I suppose you are going to worship the place where the three thieves are said to have been executed, and I suppose you will bring away a piece of wood, and say it is a piece of the very cross that bore the weight of your thief, and I suppose you will pray to, it, and work witchcraft with it, and call it your Urim and Thummim. You will never go there through any help of mine, you. apostate 1" I walked away, saying, " perhaps some one     else will help te." He again spoke very angrily, ' if I see you in this city much lon- ger, 1 will have you arrested as a spy," This was a view I had not yet taken of the mat- ter; as I walked slowly out, and along the street, I wondered what was best to do. I was in a barbarous country, had made an enemy of an individual who would be likely to do what he said, and my face was a strong witness against me. I began  to study whether there was any hope of joining a caravan in any part of the country, but while I thought of these things, every mo- mnent seemed to be fraught with danger. Perhaps, even then some one was watching whlere I would go. T The great object of my life was about to be defeated, almost at the moment of suc- cess; yet I had won a great victory. To have not .spoken would have been like sink- ing' in the deep; as it was, I was still scud- ding before the storm. I could never have looked up(n any scene once hallowed by His presence, if I had denied Hirn as a means of obtaining a safe passage. To have simply said that I  believed in Him, would not have come up to my idea of profession.  I had no objection to wearing the martyr's crown if it were His will, but if after professing Faith in Him, I had power to save my life and did not do it, but per- sisted in trying to gratify my curiosity, and 1 thereby lost my  life, it would not be the death of a  martyr, but of a self-willed ad- venturer. Besides this ray heart was so i w arrmed by having made profession, that I r thought it could not draw me any nearer to s tinm, if I stood upon the very spot where He a went up.  The wisest plan for me then was to re- h main in sight of the ship that brought me a there, as the best protection from  being p arrested; and if no other opportunity were e afforded to go to Jerusalem, I must return in the same ship. After making diligent s inquiry, and finding no other way to reach if the Holy Land, I  applied to Captain C--- I for a   returntpassage.  It was ve-y hulnilia- tl ting, but not as bad as it would have been sl to lose my life by persevering in what oi seemed unreasonable. After sorme time the tc vessel sailed, and it was with a lioght heart I al fous .   myself speeding westward on the to wings of the wind. Once in Portugal, I al imna-ined I  could feel myself at home. The to vessel returned by the same zigzag route, sl stopping at a   number- of places, some of wl which ihad no remenbrance of having seen m on the map.               af During this voyage my skill as a-mechanic be was brought into requisition, which added a wu little to my Funds. This was a plea 'which I th had never. thought of urging, when trying to en obtain a  passage, but it was all well enough ha as it was. I  had my satisfaction of sailing, at and did not expect to trouble myself to see the any more of the world. My impression of Portugal was a   good one, both from the the climate, and the treatment I  had received in   ry from my acquaintances there. My inclinea. Dn- tion was to find employment, and try to his gain a little spot that I could call home. at- When we returned to the city of Oporto, he spring was coming on, as if to give Nature a I fresh impulse in the display of loveliness. an As I was not altogether without money, I ly could not resist the temptation to spend a ig day or two amid the fresh odors of the dy country, and indulge in the relaxation which a had been so long denied wle. In the beauties ut around me, my mind let go the memory of o- my troubles, and I once more felt as free as r. when playing about my-father's door, under lg the sunshine of a mother's smile; and felt as independent as if the vineyards, and all the to lands around me were my own. -  Again the insatiable appetite for study 'o camne upon me, and'I determined as soon as k- I was able, to procure some books in English, d- and again commence a systematic course of 7e study. As I looked upon the scenes around is me, and threw all anxious care aside, and f seemed to take in my relation to the world in a  thought, it was thus I mused,-" the n search  for knowledge is my natural work; f whatever troubles I may see, or whatever ? adventures I may pass through, I feel as if f they were intended to give me better ideas r of what I may hereafter learn." -  I still used my berth on board the ship as d my lodging place, and worked at anything 3 that was to be done, but was idle a great i- deal of the time, or at least not earning o money. 1 had made the acquaintance of a [ number of business men, and endeavored to o secure their influence, to obtain a situation as a  carpenter; but it was not so easy for a stranger to get a permanent situation; so I - had to content myself to do what I could, and wait. I  found a lodging place with a poor Inan, who like myself had no particular employment, but unlike me, he had a family. When the ship and all my acquaintances started on the next voyage, I almost felt as if my home was leaving me. among strangers. I  continued until the tall to work and live in this manner, giving my spare time either to study, or making  new acquaintances in order to obtain employment, or walking out to converse with Nature. There was a  new and beautiful ship which I   was helping to load; I  admired it so much that I was almost tempted to try to engage a  passage, to whatever port she might be going. Wllex she was nearly loaded, and it was known what day stle was to sail, the captain asked me if I was a mechanic. I answered in the affirmative. He then asked me if I had not- been a  sailor. I told him I had been on the water, but was not a  very good sailor. He then said, "I heard you were trying to-find employment as a   mechanic, and thlat!You had been a   sailor; I have watched you wflile at work, and admire your motion, you are the very man to help complete my crew." As a further encouragement, he told me the vessel was going first to New Castle in England, thence touching at different   islands, and differ ent points on the coast of Africa, would go as far as the Mulaysian Islands. This was a voyage promising great satisfaction; as it was so hard to obtain steady employment, and my desire to settle could not then be gratified, it seemed like the offer came by the hand of Providence. I fitted myself out with a sailor's suit, bought several good books and went on board. It was not long before our faces were , urned toward England. My heart felt light, ny prospect was certainly a good one, with good wages, and the opportunity to study. There is much said about the tyranny of sea captains. N,o doubt there are many bad men among them, but they are so situated that a proper government is an important part of their business; it is among the first things they must attend to. The strictness which is a necessity, very easily slides into tyranny. Some of them are men that will indulge as far as it is safe, but it requires great discernment of men. Captain G- was an Englishman, of a wealthy family. He had been raised in Lisbon, had romantic notions, and the means to indulge them. Yet he was a lover of money, and,a thorough business man. He had the ship "Christo. pher Columbus " built according to his own ideas, and planned a voyage which would unite pleasure with profit. The crew was composed mostly of Portuguese. He found it necessary to order many trifling things done, in order to keep those employed who were disposed to be idle. It was never my lot to be interrupted in my studies to do anything not strictly necessary. This dis- cernment of men kept the best kind of order on board, while it oppressed no one, and was another incentive to all well-disposed sailors to do the best they could. Sailors generally know a great many yarns, and between telling them and singing, a great deal of time is pleasantly spent, that might otherwise drag heavily with them, or even lead them into temptation. The plea- sure of study, and the pleasure of meditation, were well spiced with tales of shipwreck, of starvation, of different countries, of pirates. of mutiny, of tyranny, of flogging, of some hero going  down into the water by a rope to rescue a lady, of sounding the sea and ocean; of water-spouts, of sharks and whales, q of merlmaids, and many wonders of the deep; * until I wished it might be our lot to be partakers in some  such great adventures. There were many things 1 felt sure of seeing, 1 and there were many others  which I knew X would be attended with danger, as for in- l stance a water-spout; but I felt almost willing 1 to risk the danger. When   we arrived  in New Castle, there I was no time   to look around. The vessel i was unloaded as speedily as possible, but t before reloading, the crew were called to- d gether to know their voice on a new propo- c sition. Just at the time the trade in the North Sea was more than usually profitable. fi Captain G---   had changed his plan a little, n   f 'and wished to continue the voyage still n farther north, being sanguine of great gains. At As the crew were composed of men who had n gone as much for the love of adventure as e anything else, there was not a dissenting e voice. The vessel was reloaded'as speedily  as possible, though the sanguine captain t, seemed to think it was a long delay. n  The gallant ship "Christopher Colum- e bus " once more bore us out upon the deep. , Though the coming winter would add to our 1 hardships if we were caught,-it had the ad- vantage of adding more romance; and the fcaptain was satisfied that if he could reach d Christiana early in the season, the delay and d severity of the winter would be richly repaid t by the gains. He was a man to embrace an t opportunity without delay, and then make  his mind as easy as possible. The winter D was passed very pleasantly. There was but 1 little observation made, on account of the severity of the weather; and the field of - observation, though large, was monotonous, compared with some others. The greatest : attraction to the admirer of Nature was the thought that, under this apparent desolation, the germs of life were waiting to burst forth,  the soil was resting and laying in for another strain upon its vitality. One was led to Ibelieve more firmly in the Resurrection. ' To the native of the country there must be something sublime in the very sternness and tediousness of the winters; and it ap. peared to me those qualities had a counter. part in the faces and manners of the people, -a coolness, patience, and indifference,-' which widely contrasted with the nervous, sensitive, dashing, or bigoted people I had heretofore encountered. In; these strange people there was more likeness to myself, as far as we could communicate, than in any other people I had seen. pWhat the stern- ness of winter had wrought in them, the sternness of life had wrought in me. If my greatest recreation liad been in social pleas- ures, this country might have been another home for me, but, as Nature was my favorite companion, the bleak and desolate appear- ancc of all things, instead of refreshing me, rather wrought a feeling of oppression. The stay was long, and would have been tedious if we had not been well employed. But, as we stopped at only a few points in returning, and met with no delay, it was not long  before we were again in New Castle- Little time was lost here, and again we were upon the route at first proposed. None the worse for having turned aside. The same habits of study and meditation were kept up. As a  help to my daily duties, and any occasional work that might be required of me as a' mechanic. I wrote down a list of improvements in the line of shipbuilding to the best of my  knowledge, as I had before done to make me more successful as a house- carpenter. The plan was as before,--to suppose the first effort to have been made of the handiest material, and in the simplest form,  then     each inconvenience arising from its imper- fection would be stated; then another would 'be supposed to be built of another material and in a different form; this would be also tried, and its imperfections would be the light, by which the next attempt would be made; this plan was continued until it was brought, step by step, to the present state of perfection. This was far from being scientific, but it was after the manner of real experiments, and gave me a quickness of perception equal to much experience. T'here were many ideas that proved to be ill- founded, but upon the whole the time was well spent. It obtained for me considerable indulgence from the captain, and might have obtained even more, but I refused to accept many favors that were offered, fearing the ill-will of those who, in the captain's judgment, were best employed when obeying orders. His idea was to offer a reward for well-spent time, and by keeping the idlers employed, to prevent them from breeding dissatisfac- tion. But it was not so viewed by the idlers themselves, and, in spite of my willingness to take upon myself the most disagreeable duties, the envy of some two or three was excited against me. According to my past experience, this was likely to give me much trouble, and I was willing to ward it off by any means short of actual servility. One of my shipmates by the name of L-- , by his good-nature and intelligence, drew to himself the respect and good-will of all the well-disposed, but he r also was an object of envy to the idlers. It would have been well for us all if Captain G-- had been able to fill out the number required with such men as he knew how to select. But it is one of the facts of life, that we must be content with less than what would be our choice, and exercise ingenuity to make up the deficiency. This truth is familiar to any person that ever undertook anything of importance, and is generally taken into consideration before- hand. It is only the trifler that expects to get through life easy, that frets and repines at what cannot be avoided. The strong man places himself in the gap, and the work has the advantage bf close attention; so that what appears like an evil to the trifler, becomes a great help to the well disposed man. Read Matt. xxv. 29. It was thus on this occasion. The idlers, under the strict discipline of the officers, were kept. from working any serious harm, the officers obtained more confidence in their abilities, as also those of the crew whose ex-  ample and influence helped to keep evil in check. That which will be an evil if left  alone, may become a benefit if controlled. r L--, whom I considered my friend, was  subjected to many insults, which he bore with  heroism; and though he might have brought 1 the ofenders to punishment, he chose rather 1 to keep it hidden from the officers, and re.  turn good for evil His example and corm-    - panionship was a great stay to me, helping d me to bear with more ease, and more content 1, than formerly, what it was almost a part of o my nature to expect. e  By degrees the evil was reduced until we e had a respectable crew; and finally all found s out that useful employment of spare time e was the most reasonable, and secured the g most satisfaction. This victory was gained by the adoption of a rule which would meet s with a cold reception if held up for practice,  even to the most devout. We considered it reasonable to suffer for s imaginary offences, and we bore their insults the same as if we had wronged them and were receiving our just dues. Because, at I first, the systematic devotion and study rseemed to condemn them, and they imagined we held ourselves above them; therefore, in , the evils they did us, they supposed they were only resenting what we had done to them. But Mildness, in the course of time made them see that we were their friends and they became our friends, and adopted our modes as far as they could appreciate them. In the flush of victory, my mind went back to the time when I was in the city of M. looking at ships for the first time; when de- iring to be a sailor, one of my reasons was that I might exert a good influence. That hope had now been realized, and my future seemed to look brighter. Another reason which had prompted us to bear those evils with patience, was to pre- r vent the too frequent use of authority, which is degrading to man. Many people, as soon as they meet with a slight difficulty, think about going to law the very first thing. A people who cannot rule themselves are not fit to be free; and if they cannot settle most of their difficulties by talking them over, or calling in several friends, it is because neither side is willing to sacrifice anything for the general good. When none are willing to do this, the people are slaves, even though they may elect their own rulers. Those who are willing to sacrifice are the ones who hold society together; therefore they are the princes of the country. Our ship was a little nation; the rulers did not receive their power from the crew, but from an outside force. If we had to be kept to- gether by their authority, we were slaves, but if there were enough in the little nation who would sacrifice their own feelings to the general good, so as to keep order without any outside interference, we were free. Those who made the sacrifice were the natural rulers. As individuals, and as nations, we press against each other in the relations of life, the more there is of the spirit of generosity-self. sacrifice, the more will our relation to each other tend to produce harmony; the less there is of that spirit, the more outhreaks of passion there will be. The more the influence of our mutual relation is regulated to pro. duce harmony, the more perfect is liberty ;   the less it is so, the more need of govern ment, and therefore the less liberty. The vessel was built for fast sailing, and as we were seldom long at a time without a breeze, there was no cause for low spirits. Sometimes we had a little more wind than we wanted, but it was our good fortune to be under some shelter during one or two gales. The adventures we met with were moderate in their nature, giving plenty of njoyment, but never bringing us in immi- nent danger. The variegated scenery of the ocean, was to me an ever new source of de- light. Sometimes I satisfied myself with gazing, at other times, with trying to portray my feelings in words for future enjoyment. To be enveloped in a thick fog, to witness a thunder shower, to see a ship in the distance to hear the shrieks of birds in the vicinity of islands, and many other sights and sounds each has a peculiar charm, that cannot be given by anything else. The most impatient time would be when we expected to stop at any place only a few days, and were delayed longer. After one has become  accustomed to setting foot upon strange soil, it loses its charm unless there is an opportunity to make investigations, which we had not. To the lovers of sport, the longer the stay in a town or city, the more fun; but they sometimes bring themselves into trouble. It became me to be careful in what company I went on shore. It requires much circumspection in a strange country, and especially among semi-barbarians, to keep out of trouble. The mere pleasure of setting foot on land, and knowing that it is the country or island represented by some particular spot on the map, is a pleasure which soon dies out. I tried to learn as much as possible by observ- ing the faces and customs of the people. There are many things to learn which cannot be expressed in words. A child looks at everything with interest, but it could not tell any body what it had learned, yet it is wiser than before. So a traveller will look at everything about him with interest, and keep on looking after one would suppose he might be satisfied; the nore he looks, and the more minute actions and features he observes, the deeper is the impression, and the more his mind (uncon- sciously) drinks in a knowledge of the place nd people; yet he could find no words to express what he has learned, though these  shades of difference sometimes suggest ideas  as important as those suggested by scientific I research. The study of different races of  men takes us back to the early ages of the world, and has a bearing on points in the- t ,ology. No small part of my pleasure arose a from the fact that it was like being in a x settled home, and working for the future, a and the fact of being among friends.   r While stopping on th- coast of Africa, my v mind was drawn out to think of the contrast s between different parts of this one world. r The great contrast between the last winter, I   a- in Norway, and the present summer in Africa, impressed me deeply; but the most as important thought was the moral and intel- a lectual contrast. When we reflect upon the s. great intellects that have managed the affairs in of nations, and then upon the degraded mind ;o of the heathen, it hardly seems as if both 'o were human. The giant and ,the dwarf re awaken the same feeling. The social con- f dition of those who bask in the sunshine of i- life, and spend their days in seeking pleasure, ie contrasted with the sufferings that exist in e- the large cities of the most civilized nations, h shows the full force of the passage: "The y rich and poor meet together, the Lord is the t. Maker of them all." While I thought on a these things I prayed more fervently than e, ever for the advancement of the missionary y cause, and all societies aiming at reformation. ; I felt that it would balance all my sorrows e if I could be permitted to spend my life in ameliorating the condition of the degraded i people; but there appeared a great barrier-- a it was insurmountable. These feelings were r continued throughout the voyage; and have been ever since. , While stopping in the Island of Borneo e we met with some missionaries who were on their way to some of the inland settlements. To meet the citizens of any Christian country in a barbarous land, or upon the ocean, is a pleasure equal to seeing some notable place; but to meet a colony of missionaries in my present state of mind, was like seeing the Holy Land itself. I sought an interview with one of their number, and expressed a desire to become an attendant among them, stating that my services as a mechanic might be convenient, that I was willing to do anything however menial, which would help forward in the enterprise, and could easily be released from my obligations to the captain. As he surveyed me from head to foot, his eyes twinkled with suppressed merriment, but when I told him how my mind had been affected by the condition of the tribes in Africa, and with great earnestness expressed my desire to do something to alleviate the condition of the heathen, his countenance expressed sympathy. He introduced me to two more of their number, stating what request I had made. They gave me such scrutinizing looks that I could not answer their questions without hesitation. The gentleman who seemed to have more in. fluence than any other, gave me a look as if reading my character from my face, shook his head, and said he supposed they had enough of help for awhile yet. I turned away disappointed, yet thankful that the Judge who is to pass sentence on all flesh, can look deeper than the face. My mind was much disturbed for some time after that refusal, but I gradually became reconciled to my lot, believing that the One who orders all things in wisdom, would not suffer my life to be a blank. Again my old resolution came to my aid-to be satisfied if He can see what 1 am   living for, and not     count any time wasted that is spent as He orders it. For His people sometimes acco,m- plish more by resignation and suffering- enduring to the end what He has planned, than if they were in an active field. The voyage was a long one, and as Captain O. had represented, was an interesting one. I tried to enjoy every day as it passed, and succeeded very well: some of those days are still in my memory to sweeten the cup of age. But many of them are entirely for- gotten; they served their purpose and are gone forever. It adds to my happiness now to think that my time was well spent. Tlhough imany days were dark and gloomy, the very chastenings were blessings in dis- guise, and hke the other days, they served their purpbse, 'though at the time they; seemed like a blank. The vessel returned to New Castle, about two years from the time she left Oporto. I had been a wanderer long enough. My wish was to settle down and acquire a com- fortable home. I had seen a good deal of the world; had met with many difficulties that prevented the accomplishment of my 3 purpose. My desire was a very moderate ( one, and to accomplish it I was willing to I use great exertions. The land that offered i the best opportunities was the land of my 1 boyhood. Thinking it would be as handy to I get there from England as any other country,  I thought it best to desire the captain to c release me from further obligations, and let s me remain in New Castle.        d While revolving this in my mind, my ex- perience with Mr. Fontaine and others came s forcibly to remembrance. What if Captain n G. were to treat me in the same manner? n The hypocrisy of Mr. Fontaine had shaken o my confidence in man, but only as a tree is a shaken by the wind. Still rooted down deep y in the soul was a FAITH in the better feelings e: of the human race. The question was, what t] sort of a man is the captain? In all my st dealings with him, I hand tried to penetrate c} far enough to see if there was anything in se him like Mr. Fontaine. True he loved money, w and would venture great th]ings for it, but in fo all his dealings there had lbeen a peculiar w tact, which, the farther you penetrated, the T more-closely it. resembled the policy which ar the Divine Son enjoined upon His disciples, to "'.ise as serpents, and harmless as doves." la This gave me courage; I spoke to him fu with confidence, and found I had not been th deceived. He readily granted my request. fo I helped until the vessel was unloaded and th loaded up again; he paid me all my wages m up to the day the ship left New Castle: as til the noble "Christopher" departed, I waved mi many adieus to the friendly faces on board, m and watched her till she was lost from my su view.                  dw I thought before returning home I ought ch to get a better understanding of England than I had of any of the other countries I it had seen: so the plan hit upon was to walk gu from New Castle to Liverpool, take my time, th   Ie 'stop as long as I pleased in any place, con. n- verse freely, and look at everytlflng. As I - did not care to go any more as a sailor, I d, bought a suit of good clothes, and carried my sailor clothes along. My baggage was in still light enough. for comfort. e.  When I arrived in Liverpool, there was a id ship ready to start for America. carrying a re good many emigrants. The nalesnips I had I endured had not injured my health, but only r- hardened me. Comfort was a matter of re small importance for a few weeks; so a w cheap passage answered me very well. t.  When the vessel was once fairly started, s, it is hard to describe my feelings; I am un- 3- certain whether I felt like an emigrant, or d a person returning home.  Though my y -thoughts naturally turned upon plans for the o future, there was little chance to meditate e or plan; but I had considered that before- hand, and hoped to learn a lesson in my y present situation. Evidently the great mass l- of my fellow passengers had never learned f that it was a part of man's business to s think. If the conversation that grated upon y my ear all the distance across the Atlantic 3 could have been written in full, I can form D no idea how many books it would have I made; but there was very little said in my r hearing that would bear repeating. It is to be hoped, however, for the sake of the , people whose laws they were coming to make, that in all that grinding, there were some few sentences uttered that could be dressed up so as to look like common sense. There was one story related by an old sailor, that touched me deeply. He was a native of Ireland, had been a very stout man, and an excellent sailor. In the vigor of manhood he grew tired of a sailor's life, and married in his native country. Two years after that, he made up his mind to emigrate to America. When they were in the same part of the Atlantic where the story was related, a storm arose, and in- creased so that the captain found it neces- sary to keep the passengers below. As they were about to close the hatchway, this man forced liis way up, and asked boldly if they would fasten down the best sailor on board. 'Ihe captain saw that he was an able man and asked him "are you a sailor " "Let me to the helm!" he answered, and was soon lashed securely. The storm ihereased in fury, and for the sake of life, for the sake of the many lives on board, but more than all for the sake of his wife and child, he held the ship firm. The captain saw the best man was at the helm, but the storm con- tinued to increase until it was seen the ship must go down. Only a few of the ablest men escaped death, and they, after terrible suffering. It was not his own suffering 'he dwelt upon; it was the thought of his wife and child being carried down in that living tomb! But in regard to most of the passengers, it was sometimes amusing, sometimes dis- gusting, to hear them tell how many people they had whipped, describing every motion   as if they were acting it over again. They seemed to take great delight in the thought that their tales of heroism would astonish the natives. Several Bf them spoke as if they had the promise of an office as soon as they arrived. There were two gentlemen from the Emerald Isle, who took a great liking to me. They imagined that I must haSe been the hero of many battles; and when we had landed safe in this asylum for the oppressed of all nations, my feelings prompted me to retire, and give thanks to the Preserver of men, but my two friends ourselves could "clean Out a house-full of herring,-faced Yankees." I politely declined drinking with these gentlemen, and thus made two powerfhl enemies; but I accepted another invitation from several less confident sons of the same island to go with them that we might look e for work together. We were conducted to 1 a drinking-house by a keen, smooth-tongued  man, who appeared to have been on the s watch for us. When all hands were invited b to tell what we would take, my plea was that it injured my health to drink anytil ls n strong, but they insisted that I should tLaklie n something mild to cultivate firiendship. When w all hands had taken their drink, we were con- p ducted to the office of a prominent lawyer t and politician, who, for a reasonable fee, was n ready to furnish us with naturalization pa- d pers dated baclk, and the promise of employ. meint as soonas possible. I declined the n papers, saying:I was not sure how long I fe would remain in the country. of When questioned in regard to what em- as ployment 1 wished, I told him I wanted em- of ployment as a ship-carpenter. He gave me tr a letter addressed to a friend of his in another ev city, to whom I went. It was not long be- to fore I was at work, with the prospect of good ha wages and no fear of being chleated. Provi- on dence had again smiled on me; the only str fear I now had was, that not being a voter op might cause me to lose the situation, but I m kept watch for that evil, with the intention  of being ruled by circumstances. THE  ECHHANIC.      sire WAS now in my thirtieth year, in sr sound health, had seen the world was from many points of view, was of fore systematic habits, and heartily tired ing of having no home. I wanted the ind means to acquire a home, I wanted ti an object upon which to fix my af- spec fectlens, and felt. that it would be my hap- me piest thought to settle down and devote my fro ime to labor and study.        tha   'hey Though in my devotions and my thoughts I Ighlt still remembered my parents, their memory aish could not fill all the affections of my heart s if The only difficulty in the way of marriage as was my disfigured face, which ad been like nen a wall of partition between me and the ful 'eat fillment of my desires. But there was one ust consolation, while it would make it more and difficult for me to find a wife, it would insure  for domestic happiness when I found one, foir ngs the simple reason that I would not be likel to to marry in haste. I was almost fiattere4 ads at the thought that my worst defect was th  md most prominent, and determined to knowr of beforehand if it made me the less acceptable in- I made up my mind to speak plainly about eir it, knowing it would be better to suffer dis. ke appointment before than after marriage. of There was another matter which I did not. wish to forget just at that time. The ad se ventures of the past few years had brokea rul the force of some of my habits. It became )n necessary to cultivate those habits again. ae The uncertainty of getting my wages when ok earned, had led me to place less value on to money, or rather to lay no particular plan, :d but wait for the development of eCircum- e stances. This want of forethought might d be a serious hindrance to the obtaining of s my desires. So I resolved to discipline my mind, and have it in readiness for those e moments which happen in every one's life,  n when intuitive knowledge, combined with - proper habits, is the only power he can use r to save himself from ruin; when the happi- s ness of his remaining years depend on the - decision of a moment. -  In order to do this I made it a rule to let nothing be wasted, not even the Value of. feather, and to lay off in my mind as many of the particulars of the immediate future - as possible. This would give me the habit - of close thought, and the appreciation of trifles. I began the habit of picking up everything that could be of any use, even to a nail, a pin, or a feather. This would have been a waste of time if the object had only been to save that much. but this habit strengthened the faculty for close thinking, opened my mind to several ways to make money independent of my main work, anl by degrees I obtained a tolerable clear idea of the best plan to act upon, which plan, as it became better and better organized, ia cluded a great many shades of thought, all  small matters properly arranged. I did not mix with gay company, but de- sired a companion that could sylnpathize with my past troubles, and strengthen me if sorrow should be my lot in the future. There was one whose name was first mentioned be- fore me with disrespect, and, without know. ing anything against her, I unconsciously indulged an unreasonable prejudice. Several times I heard her name spoken of in disre- spectful terms; after awhile chance brought me into her presence. She Was so different from the being I had pictired in my aind that I was astonished.     After that it was not always accident that carried me where she lived. Acquaintance first, then friendship, then more than friendship. It was plain she was not tired of my visits; yet, when I tried to utter anything more than common place remark, she shrunk like a sensitive flower. I could not understand it. T'hat sorrowful, earnest face was not the face of a coquette, yet it was plain she tried to ward off my attempts to propose. No slander could make me believe that the good quali- ties written in the countenance, were not stamped on the heart. There was no cover- ing of hidden purposes in that face; it was certainly a true index to the heart. I did not wish to remain in doubt, and pressed the matter with boldness. She looked sor- rowful, and said it was impossible. I excused myself for having been so bold, and acknowl- edged that my face was rather repulsive; but my presumption was the effect of true devotion. She looked more sorrowful than ever I had seen her, and I repented my rashness. She said there could be no reason- able objection to my face, but therc was a nystery in her past life, which, if I' knew, I ,would care no more about her. I assured her that nothing past, and nothing that any ,one could say, would change my opinion of her. After much persuasion she told me all: then I told her my history, and we were soon after that made man and wife, Provi- dence had again favored me. Her history was a duplicate of my own. She had been left an orphan, had fallen into the hands of strangers, had been persecuted more than other orphans on account of her parentage, had been compelled by her mis- tress to steal wood from a neighbor, and had suffered the punishment of the law. This had caused many other misdeeds to be asso- ciated with her name. She was religious, affectionate, industrious, economical-every. thing that I could have asked her to be ex- cept educated. All this I knew upon a short acquaintance, could know it by observation; but there was one thing I did not know, and I asked her plainly-if my face did not make, me re- pulsive. Her answer was as plain as my question: she said in, substance, "suppose, n ten years from now, you were able to buy a farm; you look in the papers and see wherever there is a farm for sale, until you et a long list; you fix on one that you think vill suit you, and when you go to look at it you find it the very farm where you, can best enjoy yourself: but there is nothing on earth perfect; your farm will be sure to have some faults, some of them can be reme- died, others cannot. It may be in a healthy locality and have many advantages, so that you could have full satisfaction; but you think you would like it a little better if it were exactly square. Would you, in such a case, reject that farm, and continue to look antil you found one with no fault? I know what any sensible man would do. I see in your face the expressy Lo of all good qualities. j   but you have met with an accident. I might be a little better pleased if you were exactly square, but I will not destroy my happiness for a notion. Love speaks from one heart to another, regardless of accidents; it is only taste that recognizes features." Though these were not her exact words, they were her exact meaning: much has been said about love, many hearts have been made sad by the glance of a fellow-traveler, or casual meeting in some public place, or some corn. pany, and many duels have been fought in the name of love; but that which she de- scribed gave me more satisfaction than many poems, or presents of bouquets. If I had been permitted to mark out what would make me happy,-before experience gave me judgment, my choice would have been very different from what was given. But Providence chose more wisely for me. My choice would have been plenty, and ease, except when inclination led me to undertake something romantic; then I might have been trapped by some of the fickle beauties, with small talk, weak nerves, and shallow ,hearts. My choice might have been to lead men in battle, and gain myself a name at the expense of the suffering and death of many confiding men, and the making of -many widows and orphans. My desire was to visit the Holy Land, to ascend the highest mountain, to go into the deepest mine, to ride high in the air in a balloon, to go to the bottom of a river by some contrivance and bring up a precious stone. But these were not allowed, the opportunity to exercise Pa- tience and Meekness had been given me, which is greater than the glory of the war. rior. The happiness of labor and study had been given me, which is more solid than the pleasures of ease or romantic adventures. A companion was given me who had seen sor- row, and could sympathize with me in com- ing troubles. In her all the noblest faculties had been developed, that she might be a stay in the hour of distress. We were both blessed with health and strength, and the common duties of life afforded many pastimes. She was indus. trious and economical, which made her a help rather than an expense: it was cheaper to keep house and support a family with such -a companion, than to remain single. The only fear was of losing employment; yet I could not but believe that provision would be made for us by the One who regulates the affairs of men. The same desire to do justice to my employer, which had always ruled me, now made me a favorite with those having charge; and the desire to live in peace, even at the expense of suffering un- justly, made me a favorite. with my fellow- workmen. The fear of being discharged gradually wore off, and still I kept clear of politics. As it were to give the finishing stroke, and complete our happiness, we agreed to join church. Not that we considered all the par- ticulars of that particular denomination     necessary to salvation, but we agreed that the yoke would not be hard to wear, and the benefit of Christian communion might over- balance the inconvenience of unnecessary re- striction. We were the more encouraged to do this, as our circumstances made it possible for us to suffer those inconveniences without infringing on the laws of health. The conduct of Mr. Fontaine had been a warning to me to "look out for the hypo- crites," and steer clear as possible, preferring to run upon the shoals of life, rather than encounter a hypocrite. Yet we ventured to become members of a denomination. We attended church and sunday-school regu- larly, and meetings through the week; besides this I was a member of a literary society, and belonged to a reading club. My wife was a member of a Dorcas society. Surrounded by religious and social privi- leges, and with a fair prospect of laying up for the future, I felt myself master of the position, and could afford to forgive much. We could afford, also, to be liberal to all benevolent institutions, especially to the missionary cause, in which my whole heart seemed settled. Our care and keeping was committed to Him, and we were compelled to exercise Faith. I made it an important study to unite with my brethren in worship that it might profit all. The view I took was that the offering of our whole hearts every day to God, is the PURE SACRIFICE spoken of by the prophets, and that when we come together on the Sabbath, there should be some advantage over every-day devotions. Sometimes when we ask the Holy Spirit to assist us in offering the sacrifice, we find it difficult to realize the answer to our prayer. There need be no difficulty if we will only think of the part our Divine Master performs. He instituted the sacrifice, first offering up all of Himself that was capable of suffering. It is His will that we should all unite in this sacrifice, whether we are assem- bled bodily or not, that the offering may be ONE. In doing this we carry out the design for which He came into the world: we thereby acknowledge Him King. The more frequently we come before the King with the desire to honor Him, the oftener He holds out the scepter to us: we live the nearer to Him, and have the more influence in His government. If there is any  other desire, it must be brought into sub- i jection. If we return from the place of sacrifice any more under the ihfluence of His Love than before, we have not offered in i vain. Even though we can perceive no ( difference, it may be like the continual E dropping which wears the rock; we still  have not offered in vain.        1 If we are cast down with troubles, by c having tried to bear up against them with t our own strength; then offering ourselves a a sacrifice, we feel that we are his, and that c He who accepts us, accepts our troubles with I   t us; it is all one whether we receive extra strength to bear them, or they be removed. Every sin we commit will bring trouble -on ourselves and others. Every day we I offer the sacrifice we commit less sin than if t we had not done so; therefore we have less trouble to bear. Our sin has an influence  upon our neighbors. The less we sin, the less we cause them to sin, and the less -trouble they have to bear. Our prayers are as incense in the sight of God,-they please Him, and He seeks where to bless us in such a manner as will not cause us to forget Him. What greater blessing can we have in this world than o feel that, we are doing good to others? Therefore when we pray, the Spirit works with our neighbors. The more Christians pray and sacrifice, the better it is for the whole world. The unthinking man has a better world to live in. The more we worship Him, the more we become like Him. His happiness is in doing good, and ours must be the same before we can be one with Him. The more we be- come like Him, the more important position shall we occupy in His Kingdom. There. fore the great object for which we sacrifice is to obtain eternal glory. We must offer a spirit broken and con- trite; though it may be diseased with sin, it will be accepted, if we at the same time pray for resignation, that we may have grace to submit to the discipline which will be neces- sary to make us pure. The work of purify. ing must be done by G 'd himself, our part is to be resigned, and to pray that'He may discipline us until we are fully subdued. When that is done, there will be no element within us to oppose His reign. He claims this as His right, "For He must reign till He hath put all enemies under His feet." Having so arranged all affairs as to neces- sitate strictness of living and regularity of habits, the next thing was to set about planning a regular course of studies. There is a great deal that ought to be learned; what seems trifling at first may be turned to account unexpectedly; many noble thoughts-even great inventions, spring from a knowledge of some trifling, common. place matter, which comes up in a train of thought, just at the moment to modify and give it a form. I looked at my own igno- rance; all that I knew might be summed up in a few words,-a few elementary truths concerning the nature of things in general, which every child knows, a moderate train- ing in the branches of a common-school education, a knowledge of human nature such as might be obtained by coming in contact with different characters among men, a knowledge of the locality of several different countries, with some of their cus- toms, a few words in several different tongues and such a knowledge of my own heart au could be learned by drinking sorrow's cup, by being placed in a variety of circumstan.  :i     ees, and in different relations to my fellow- men, tasting pleasures, to prove them, and sorrow, as my proper experience. Looking forward to what I desired to be my road to knowledge seemed long, the hill seemed high. There is the rule " know thy- self" which I felt to be imperative ; and yet that one rule embraces a number of sciences. There is one that treats of man's body, and gives a knowledge of its mechanism, which seemed to be almost as necessary as to knov how to eat, and yet men have devoted their -whole lives to this one study, and never ahthomed its depths. That science which treats of man's mind which analyzes it, and shows the office per- formed  by each of the mental faculties, seemed as necessary as a knowledge of the mechanism of,the body.  Another treats of those relations which arise from the neces- sity that man is under to eat bread by the sweat of his brow; this necessity gives rise to a desire to lay up for the future, which desire, in its turn, gives rise to outgrowing laws, regulating the comparative worth of different kinds of labor. Others treat of the relation between man and his fellow-men, and another of that between man and his Maker. So it appears that to take a single human being, and study all that can be learned fron  him, will take several life- times. After that there is the science which treats of the animals, a wide field for investigation *  there is the vegetable kingdom, another great I and wide field; Geology, exploring those i parts of the earth concealed from general } observation, digging beneath its surface, to ] bring up lessonl books from its bowels, and e divin to the bottom of the sea, to unfold its 1 mysteries. There is Astronomy, soaring C away from the earth altogether, and treating 1 of worlds which occupy unmeasured space- the homes of other beings, which may be g like ourselves, or may show some wisdom of o God not revealed on this planet. All these b expand our minds to think upon them: oh, iz if we could grasp them all in one life-time! p There is another which picks diamonds as d it were, from the things we use, the objects b1 and occurrences of every day. Another w changes those things into different forms, b from simply considering what are their original elements. Another goes still farther, is and blinding our eyes, works chances that tf have the appearance of miracles. There are n( the Mathematics, so necessary to a  well or- ea dered mind, they seem to be as it were only S] the practical workings of common sense. All these are for man. They are the pro- w: ductions of the Eternal mind. They glide into each other so as to form ONE MGHTY Ci "ESSON, which man is slow to comprehend. pr How much must a    man study to know him- ft selfl and yet God knows him. Vast is the th lesson laid down for man to learn, to be 'we divided among many individuals; yet He knows them all. 'ile knows much that is not intended for man to know, and yet up   w- men profess themselves to be wise.  One Id man may study a life-time on one branch of this great lesson, and another on another be branch; thus they have done for ages, hand- ill ing down the fruit of research from one gen- y- eration to another, each generation adding et all it could, like the snow ball rolling down- s. hill, gathering as it goes. Thus men will go id on yet for time indefinite; and when they have h gone to the last of time, and added all their xv knowledge together, they will only then ir have learned what the great Teacher knew r from all eternity. If men are accounted wise because they can 1, dive into the depths of wisdom and bring up r- golden truths, how wise must He be who I, planted them there? If a man is wise be- e cause he has succeeded in some branch of f science, and if the race is wise by uniting all - the wisdom of individuals, how wise must He e be who knows it all,-and more?  If the one e is wise who solves a problem, how wise must i he be that proposed it? If that man is wise ; who understands the last new invention, how wise is he who studied out that invention? e How wise is He who studied out all inven. , tions! Then, in this large field, where shall I pick ; my   spot to labor? First, I must know enough about the great Teacher himself, and my   relation to Him, and not to offend Himn, but to secure His aid. In order to do this, I  must know what course to steer. Now if I consult reason, she tells me to examine all the doctrines of all the sects that have arisen in the world.  This is a hard task; and, be- sides, how do I know I can find it out then? Reason tells me that reason can decide prop. erly: but even if it can, what rule am I to live by while searching?  This is the right question to ask; it strikes the true road, and leads us fron darkness to light. The popular idea is that reason is the guide, and hence the perplexing suggestion of examining all the different codes put forth by ambitious men. But, in FAITH that God is Just, we wish to do what will secure hap. piness, though entirely ignorant of ortho- doxy. Hence, through  Faith, we do the best we carn while making the examination: we desire a  rule to go by,-this is suggestJ by Faith. 'IThe seeker says, "I will do the best an ignorant man can,'" and the consequence is, that he intuitively applies the golden rule,- 'not because it is in his nature but havmng exercised Faith, which is the gift of God, the Spirit operates upon him. Then he has grace to apply that rule, which grace is the gift of God. Long after he has been exercising this prin- ciple, upon which hang the law and the prohets, Reason comes along and takes up the fact that he has been doing so, and the fact that the effect is good, and proves that if all tlhe "world would do so, there would be no evil. Faith first, Reason second. Faith leads us to act, and Reason, standing upon the ground thus made, discovers that   what has been done is the work produced by Faith. Reason analyzes the whole subject, and claims to be the guide. This will be seen more clearly by going back to the point from which we started. It is necessary to learn first-our relation to the great Teacher; commencing the search on our own plan-by reason, leads us a perplexing route; because, searching what others have said, is building on another's foundation. If every one builds on some one else, they will all fall together; but if each builds independently, upon the True Foundation, then all will stand. First then we are to exercise faith, or, in other words, to listen to the teachings of the Spirit; and the Spirit will help our infirmi ties. this is proved by experience when we try to DO His will, when we ask, '( what rule shall I live by while searching?" and when through desire to please Him, we intuitively apply the golden rule. After that, we are to use means to know what others believe autd do. Thus each member of Christ's Body will be planted in Him; thus they will sympa- thize with each other, as is proper for the members of one body. Being planted by Faith in the Rock of Ages, we are made bold,- and become firm to sustain our relation to Him who overcame the world. Faith lays hold of the sacred truths of the Bible, and shows them  to be of God, which no other system  can claim. By Faith we are led from the golden rule to be willing to E suffer for the general good-which is the practical working of the plan of Redemption. But the want of Faith is Infidelity-which acts upon the contrary principle. The plan of Redemption   is to do good to all, and l resist not evil; but die rather than break c the principle-believing  that God will still E raise up seed unto Abiraham. Infidelity says,  " look out for Number One;" when you see-  a  chance to benefit yourself-do it, no dif-  ference whom it hurts; do all you can for s yourself, and let others do the same. This b principle gives but a  poor chance to the 1 weak; there is no difference made between e right and might.             t Infidelity sells the bed from under the un- li fortunate debtor, and turns him a beggar (or c robber) upon the world; it takes advantage t o: the innocent girl, whose needle plied late s and early cannot keep her from want; it s grinds down the price of her industry, c until she is torn with anguish at the prospect tl of starvation. Then it holds up allurements i  -7plenty, ease luxury, grandeur,-all these. e] as the price o. shame. It coils around her sr -with patient, silent movements, and when p sure of its victim, seizes her, and drags her n to the house of shame. It invades the peaceful country, robs and to burns and strikes terror wherever it goes, si and feeds itself upon the plunder. Though . some who do these things profess -Chs-'ai tianity, they do not act on Faith, and are sa therefore Infidels. Infidelity establishes tho rule that I must P   ,y help nobody, for fear I will not be assisted t, in return; that I must do nothing for pos. terity, for fear posterity will do nothing for g me; that the strong must look out for them- d. selves, and let the weak do the samne if they n are able. Thus it becomes the god of force, e the Baal, the Apollyon, the Destroyer, the s Agent of the Spirit of Evil. . t  Then I must shun Infidelity which des- s troys, and exercise Faith which saves, which e creates; faith which helps the weak, faith fwhich exercises in the only tlue chivalry. e  Faith is the natural (appropriate) exercise ot the human heart; long before the child n can reason, it exercises faith, first as vn e infant taking food from   the mother, aul' afterwards in running to that mother for eevery imaginary want. Infancy is the con- e dition in which faith predominates; ,* of such t is the Kingdom of Heaven." As reason grows strong, faith grows  weak, but still , enters largely into every relation of life. When  the race was in its infancy, faith was Istrong-it directed all movements; but grad- ually it became weak, and when exercised in sin, degenerated into sorcery. This is one of the teachings of Nature. This is the first lesson in order, and hav- ing learned this, I have a firm foundation to stand upon while I learn other lessons. These other lessons are to be learned at different times of life, according to my ex. perience. I  must draw  lessons from  the events that belong to my   experience, fromn the book of Nature, from  books written by men, but more than   all, frolm the guidance of the Holy Spirit through faith, There was the Bible, my first choice of books; then such books as I could borrow out of the several libraries, were very in- structive and interesting; a standard history was my next choice; next, I loved the standard poets, and works in different de. partments of knowledge.  I   enjoyed the selected pieces in readers and speakers, then books of travel were my   delight. In early life I had read several works of romance, arid enjoyed themn, but it seemed like wastingr time. -I subscribed for several papers, -r(. ligious, political, agricultural, and comirer cial: this helped me to form  an idea of things my situation did not permit me to see; yet those ideas were crude and  ill. shapen; I was aware that the  world was changing, and that even while I  considcrel these tlings, some new discovery migliht le in progress, which would overturn the pres- ent system of science; but I  used all lmy spare time. I also studied the characters of persons, and did not forget that some tLhin s must be received on the word of others. I   tried to make use of every opportunity to do good, to live consistent with my profes- sion, to set a good example, to exert an in.  fluence by my actions, to speak a good wordl and to give to a   good cause. (This is not said in the spirit of boasting). But there was still need of Meekness and Patience.  This was not only necessary     toward the rough characters with whom I came in contact, but also members of my own denomination. When two or three are accustomed to meet together to pray, there ought to be such a fellowship among them, that they could deal in business matters without using the strict forms of law, which are necessary in dealing with dishonest men. Yet one after another of my brethren would have a small sum  off. me, showing they would have done more if I had given them the opportunity. There could certainly be no spiritual gain from meeting with such individuals, and I proposed to my wife that we should with- draw.  She urged me to remain for these reasons. "'I'There are a few that do not com- mit these crimes: seek them out and be more in their fllowship.  Never leave while there is one true Christian left. More- over, you can do good to those who can do no good to you.  Perhaps your example will lead them right." I concluded to re- main, but felt it my duty to show my dis- pleasure at such things, knowing that silence would be an acknowledgment that it was right. I  mentioned it privately to individuals, and as a proof that it was not an imaginary evil, mentioned what had been done. They only laughed, and said I  must be sharper next time: they thought it was for the sake of the -money I  had spoken. This state of affairs continued, and I continued to battle with them in humble confidence. Another evil which gradually opened to my understanding, was the bigotry existing t among the most zealous of my   brethren. 'I'hey would' say in so many words that 1 every man had a  right to a free conscience; 1 and there they felt they could afford to stop i in their liberality : for when I uttered a word c in favor of any other denomination, which . amounted to anything more than a  general n admission of free conscience, it either met t with a   sneer, or with fierce opposition. r Gradually I  learned that while I could go a so far as to allow a general free conscience, c yet to be considered a  faithful member, I n must cut loose all friendship with other r denominations. Moreover, tlicre were other a evils which I  thought should be noticed. a ur pastor was living in grd andeur  and ury, pampering the flesh, breeding cor- tl tion, and justifying his effeminate mnode  life by the fact that he never touched It toxicating liquors. This did not seein to y e   a sufficient restraint to prevent corrup- ro tion. It was necessary for me to be tem- -s; perate in all tilings, and live by rule; and .i although I  had not since joining the clhurch, si tasted anything that would intoxicate, I did not consider it any greater sin than what cl the minister was doing, and training hs as children to do, and all others who could ha raise the money. I   had seen men whlo He were so foolish as to injure their hlealth by ai strong drink, yet they would not cheat, and pa if a  person was in trouble, they would go to wr some inconvenience to help him.     th   I  But our minister would only favor cora ay mon people with a dignified nod. If any one re was out in a storm with no shelter, the re minister's beds were too costly to be spoiled n, by taking such a person in; his family were rs too sensitive to admit such a one to their h table. Was the small-pox in town, many  might suffer and die, but there was no one Id in his house that would risk spoiling a y classic face. These  disagreeable  duties mmust be performed by people who were be- neath the notice of the minister's wile; th ir n innate holiness made them  the last ones -'o I make a sacrifice. l-  If persecution were possible, it is onnl e reasonable to suppose our minister would L- recant his faith, and join the strong side,-. e his pampered and sensitive flesh could never e stand the storm of persecution, the pains of - crucifixion. Gal. ii. 20. But as matters o stood, his kind of religion was popular, and e he went with the tide. His preaching was - very popular with some, but his ideas, strip. - ped of their fine clothes, were shameful. He  wanted a  finer house to live in. A  subscription was started to raise the amount , necessary to build it. I thought of heathen r nations, and gave nothing.  He  came to t pay me   a pastoral visit, the first since I had been living  in the place.  His man- ner was   dignity blended with politeness. After some   trifling conversation, he men. tioned the object of his visit; I asked one favor,-that was the  permission to give to the   missionary cause, the amount he thought I  ought to pay to his mansion. His eye flashed fire; then he controlled himself, granted the request, and took his leave. Soon after this, he anticipated my intended -withdrawal, and read me-out of the church. I  gave the amount named to the Agent of the Missionary Society, and the whole affair led me to study very closely a table, which showed the probable amount of money necessary to evangelize the world, and the amount spent annually in different countries lor rum, tobacco, silks, silver orna- ments, and other unnecessary articles. The result was surprising; the amount spent for any one article was more than sufficient; all united, all the amounts added together and placed on one side. and the demands of the G(ospel on the other, showed what power was exercised by the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life. And yet the people %wlho bly united efforts thus rob G(od. clainm to be innocent. Th'le alnoult -sacrificed to those gods is very great, the salrount demallded by the Gospel is very smllall. I now more than ever looked into tlhe characters of men, and took examples, such as Joseph, Jonathan, Josepllus, on the one hand. and on the other hand, such as Napo- leon and Voltai-re, to try to imitate the grood and shun the bad. At the samne time I  com- pared my secret devotions with what I  had written while attending church, and found that I   could still unite with all the faithful.   I saw that the Church is one and indivisible, and is composed of all the faithful. The bond of union is Love; and when any code, or -creed, or clique, or sect, usurps the place of Love, it is against the spirit of Christianity. Apostolical succession, I saw to consist of the succession of good and holy individuals, who by lives of suffering and purity, of de- votion to, and activity in, the good cause, have held the Church up (under God), when Infidelity might easily have overthrown all the sects with one sweep. But while the faith- fr.' few live, and do and suffer the righteous Will, there is a prop that holds up the visi. ble body, and all its encumbrance of hypo- crites. Apostolical succession is spiritual. My domestic life was unclouded. It is almost the only part of my sky that shone clear altogether, the only fraction of my life that was completely happy. Even the little partings and meetings sweetened rather than eembittered life. One day, when we had only one child, my wife left home, to stay several days, and took the infant with her. I went with them to see them safe on board the boat, then returned home. As returning, my heart went along with them, affection   created many imaginary dangers in their path, and led me to pray fervently. Wllen I went into the house, there was the same lonesome echo that carried me back to my first orphanage.  My heart was touched by  the memories that crowded in, as I thought of the present situation. I prayed for their safety; but why could I expect my prayers to be answered?  In that hour of devotion, while my heart was touched, it seemed as if my rules of living were too  luxurious, that there was too much self-in- ] dul-gence: it seemed as if I had no reason to v expect an answer to my prayer. A thousand a dangers threatened them. as if to bereave me. and punish me for valuin, earthly enjoy-  ment. 1 prayed fervently, besought morcy,  and resolved to live as strict as possible, not ' to injure my health : thlen wrote out the fol- g lowing rule, after which my mind was easy; 1 I felt they were sale, and could go to work. t ' Be c(ontent with simple fare, and liard t times,--(I live for others' good and  His x glory). that when  'lironds depart, or any c f tiler sorrow colnes, I )Iny have consolation. t muist, pray as I work alonr, and( lot my en- e j,)5ymnt be in the thotlghts whckl are san- e gested Iby the tolly Sp)irit.

'lenll fields depart, I must a follow thtemn in niy pye, rsl thllroll a11 the s details of  their journley  and that will c straighten my  mind. I must not dwell on 1 theml too much.-in this case truth and hap- n piness are between  the two extrelmes, of 1 trying to drown  the memory of themn, and p cherislhini. it to the exclusion of other tlings."  Years passed, and my  family was seven in f nuamber. I  had saved enough  to buy a a home; and though I   disliked roving, I re- b solved to quit the present business, and try   I, farming, for several reasons. The life of a e farmer gave more scope for individual effort, r gave more room for exerting influence, and was more in accordance with my idea of individual sovereignty. The good of my children demanded it, and that left no room , for debate. My mind was made up. I pur- - chased in a part of the country where land , was cheap, and in a reasonable time we were established in our new home. THE FARMER. AHE spot was not romantic according to my idea of the term, yet it had its charms; and we knew that when all its natural good qualities were associated with the idea of home, we should soon regard it as the favorite spot on earth. Our neighbors were as yet some distance off; but we went to work, making improve- ments, and were happy. I also laid plans to enlarge my influence when we should have plenty of neighbors, the plans being on the principle that if you will do everything right, the result will be plain, the comparison will show others that your way is the best, and lead them to accept it. I pictured in bright colors the result of my efforts, and hoped to see a peaceable and happy neighborhood. I had heard of the shepherds of the Alps, sounding the praise of God from  peak to peak through their trumpets; I wished that all the  world would do the same. I had heard the sound of voices on calm evenings, when the whole neighborhood seemed to be alive with sounds of voices, of hammer and saw, and of wagons rattling along the road; when the little warblers would join in and sing the praise of Him who made them. Thaen I  said, " is not this the earnest of the shepherds of the Alps?  But alasl Ithe hearts of the sons of men are fully set in them to do evil.' They draw trouble on tlhemnselves by their own actions, and this world which the Mlaker intended for a para- dise, is turned into a penitentiary. Oh, that the hearts of men were with God!- ()h, that eachl heart were Ilis throne! then they inig(ht enjoy all innocent amusements. or engage in active duty free from care, and speak tile praise of God by every action.' It seemed as if Providence had led moe by an unknown path to a  field of usefulness. I still regulated my habits so as to continue a course of study, but had to forego the privi. leges afforded by a city. I looked back upon my past suffering, and felt that my hour of happinesm lhad come. All my present hlap- piness was plainly the fruit of severe disci- pline. "his led mne to follow the thought furthler, till I saw that the Church itself, and all the happiness it is to produce, is built up by the sufferings of individuals. When one is brought through a great     -trial, it teaches a lesson of principle; then when another trial conies that could be Avoided by breaking a rule, the individual is led to hold out faithful till God's own time of deliverance. People admire the moral courage, and are led to inquire the cause and the individual "gives -a reason for the hope that is within him." Thus a sympathy is awakened, an idea is advanced, and stamped by a bright example. Feeling myself upon the. climax of happi- ness, I had leisure to look upon my past life, and weigh the advantages against the disad- vantages. I had been a stranger while others were at home, had longed to elicit their sympathy, but had met with cold re- pulse. I had been injured by many, was naturally bashful, had been frightened with ghost stories, was constitutionally of delicate health, wakeful, and nervous : had been pre- vented from pursuing my studies with desired diligence, had been disfigured by the hands of evil men, had suffered hunger and thirst heat and cold, and many other afflictions. On the other hand these sufferings had increased my Faith in His goodness, they had given me the benefit of experience, I was blessed with an inquisitive mind which left trifling matters, and sought only after such knowledge as could be of benefit. For this re-son a knowledge of the laws of health had  enabled me to pass through hardships under which stout men without systematic habits had sunk. I was now enabled to think of many scenes, and associate them in such I variety as to give me happiness. The pres-  ent circumstances were favorable for the  operation of all my plans. Though I had  been disappointed in some things, as for  instance or seeing the Holy Land, 1 had  received an equal blessing in being permitted  to testify for Him in an enemy's land.  And now the prospect was that I should 1 have the opportunity of helping to mould the community of which I was hereafter to 1, be a member. Added to all this, the land e which I had bought was well chosen. There a was a prospect of a town being built upon 1 it, and its value was fast increasing. M I could look back upon my past sorrows i in triumph; for now there was nothing lack- fi ing to make me as happy as a man can be o upon earth. When I thought upon those a who were still bereft, or suffering from pov- erty or oppression; oh, how I longed to v make them partakers of my happiness I Thea only fear was that I should lose sight of the p fact that the present happiness wasbrought  about by severe discipline, and think that o happiness was the absence of suffering. m Man is made to suffer; both inconvenience ai and sorrow are necessary to call all his facul- in ties into operation.  I had laid out my plans in my past life to w secure happiness by doing good to men, and s moving among them as a benefactor, but m now  the fact was plain to be seen that w happiness is in doing good in obscurity, so. a as to rejoice in the smile of heaven, The fo   n fact that it is known to none but Him, makes ;e His knowledge of it the more highly valued, is and a source of greater happiness. e There was also another field open, the lI same as when dealing with my church e, brethren. I did not want to presuppose any e man a rogue; for if this is e the rule of life it strips our daily influenge of its moral force d and turns it to a source f sin: for when an ignorant man find hlat the rogue is con. i sidered the stan rdc of humanity, he makes , that his aim. If it is made the standard - rule of dealing between man and man, that e one must cheat because others do, then all t will sink down to the level of rogues, and all - be rogues together. But if intelligent s citizens will show by their actions that they 1 have so much confidence in man, that they a are willing to lose a small sum once in a - while, for the sake of setting the standard d higher, then social influence will be in favor sof honesty. (Some people are with their , honesty like they are with their temperance; they embrace all degrees from one extreme to the other, as the Temperate Zone touches the Torrid and Frigid). This plan, though it was not fallen upon for sinister motives, helped to add to the value of my property. The plan made a select community. At first I obtained neigh- bors by writing for some of my friends whom I knew to be good people: and after we had quite enough for company, it took a majority of votes to admit any person as a neighbor, as I had promised them not to sell to any person to whom a reasonable objection could bemade. The consequence was that people who wished to live in peace, came to us, and sharpers generally kept aloof. It did not take long to make a good many improve- ments; houses were built, young orchards set out, the crops were abundant, and we lived in happiness. That happiness, however, was not to last long. We were reminded that we were in an evil world. There was a sharper who calne among us to buy a building lot. His every look revealed the unprincipled scoundrel, whose only desire was to enter like a wolf into the fold, that he might grow rich by fleecing. The people were all asked their opinion, and were all of one mind, that such a person would cause great disturbance. He was refused upon the ground that tLe voice of the little republic was unanimous against him. He insisted that it was my property, and I had a right to sell it to him as much as any one else. I told him of my promise, and that as he had the money, the whole country was open to him, and it would be more agreeable to his feel- ings to go where he would meet with no objections. He became terribly angry, and went away saying that bad luck would befall such people. The next season when my most profitable crop was ready for market, we awoke one morning to find the best of it carried off, and the remainder trampled under foot.   Soon after that the man came again witl a malicious smile, and renewed his applica- tion, stating that the calamity had befallen me as a judgment. As there was no change in the sentiment of my neighbors, he was again refused, but we kept watch a long time, fearing more mischief. The next winter, on one stormy night, in spite of watchfulness, our house, and those of several neighbors were set on fire; and notwithstand ing great exertion to save them, they were burnt to the ground. As I had not built a very costly residence, this was a trifling loss to me. With my neighbors, it was rather more severe; but the Law of Love was there and the homeless were made welcome in the souses of others. In due time the houses. were rebuilt. We all suspicioned this man, but could prove nothing against him. We however arranged our business as if it had been one man's, and had watch kept ever after that. In the meantime troubles were coming on that concerned not only our little town, but also our fellow citizens all, over the country. For a long while, all the time I had to spare for general study was devoted to this one subject. War broke out, and as I was en- joying the benefit of a free government, I did not intend to stand still and see oppres- sion raise its serpent head, and destroy the fruit of Liberty. I went at my country's call. WAR. WAS now about to pass through r greater dangers than ever before. c It had always been a wonder to me, c how so many missiles can fly at so c large a target, and so little harm be v done. IThat mystery is solved by e considering the part that is taken by the Divine Hand. In mercy to weak man, p and especially those who are forced by duty, n ornot seeing their duty are forced by draft o that Great Being who is the Creator, also o becomes the Preserver of lives.     l This, instead of moving men to thankful- e ness, and the making of efforts to preserve t peace, make some of them the more rash, t thinking as there is so little harm done com- pc pared with what might be expected, they r will venture yet farther in their evil designs. th There is an effort made by manceuvering h in battle, to save as many lives as possible, but there are positions which require to be so taken by a quick movement; the storming fe party know that the more fury they dis- ot play, the safer they are, and the besieged a party know that to be taken at a disadvan- lo tage is the losing of many lives: therefore fr they stand as firma as possible, and prepare je to pour in a deadly fire.        M( Msany battles are won by blind fury, which li is a very different thing from bravery; and plf   tli many battles are lost by a misunderstanding. 'a- As a balance to this tendency to greater en and greater fury, there is an effort made by ge wise and faithful commanders to save tLeir as men; but the main dependence of a soldier is ig not in the wisdom of his commander; it is et in the mercy of the Most Merciful Being. )f  But as men disregard the care that God al uses to save their lives, and do not let it d- move them to keep peace, the time will come re when He will lift up his protecting hand, a and suffer them to kill one another until the ;s blood reaches the horses' bridles. r  There is one fact that gives us great diffi- a, culty. There are true Christians on both e sides, and they pray each for victory. God s. has promised to answer the prayer of faith. They both pray in faith according to the d general acceptation of the term: yet both r cannot be answered in the way they expect. e So far as wars have influence on human ;. happiness, it is best always to leave this a provision,-that whichever is better for the t human race may be victorious. That man who prays squarely for the victory of his own side, without any provision, utters a a selfish prayer. Another point that rises up is this. There are members of the same society, using the same forms of devotion, standing on different sides in the same battle-field. The idea w$' form of a church is, that its members should' be in perfect harmony. Yet there are good men-members of the same church, fighting against each other. This fact shows what power the Evil Spirit has over the affairs of men, how much it usurps the power that properly belongs to' God. It can be true only of obscure individuals, whose position makes them to a certain extent, the victims of the machinations of evil men, which ma- chinations make the duty of men appear so complicated, that it is hard for them to tell what to do. When such is the case, it is easy to err in judgment. But this can never be. true of Christian princes, who, unlike the obscure individuals, may fully comprehend their relation to each other. If they war with each other at all one or both must be wrong. The spirit of love actuates all true Christians, to whatever sect they may belong, incliining them to try to secure peace; and just in proportion as they can influence the affairs of a nation will peace be preserved. But when passions rage, it is like the rushing of a great flood';  the very lords of creation are carried along helpless, in spite of all their struggles. Besides the dangers from the enemy, a soldier has also the. same relation to his fellow-soldiers that citizens have to each other. Therefore he has dangers threaten- iMg him from his own people; many lives are lost by accidents; there is much unhappiness from quarreling and fighting; there are jealousies, envyings, and mutinies; there is more sickness than in any other station of life. Truly God has set His mark of dis. pleasure on the military profession. Yet He     4s merciful, and preserves the lives of sol- diers the same as-others: and even more, for, as before mentioned, it is a miracle that so few are struck. It is because there are cer- tain laws that may be called the laws of Providence, just as certain others are called the laws of Nature. Prayer is answered, and labor is rewarded. The man who sows and cultivates will reap, while he who neglects the one will miss the other. He that is dissipated in the days of his youth, will feel pain in after life; while he that takes care of his health in youth, will be sprightly in old age. The man who is selfish, and provides onlyfor his own comfort, not caring to benefit others, will, in the day of need. feel the want of a friend; whilehe who has been accommodating will always find a friend in need. A contentious man will fall into many quarrels, while a reasonable and patient man will go smoothly on through life. These laws have been so arranged, that they might be an incentive to virtue. But if Providence had stopped here, too many things would we been left to chance.  The, wicked ould then have rejoiced over the downfall 'the righteous. War is an example: good men and bad ien stand together in the same ranks. hough some good men are killed, and some id ones escape, God singles out those lie tends to spare. Sometimes it becomes the ity of a good man to stand where escape seems impossible; the air all around him will be swept with the missiles of death, some even venturing to pierce his clothing, but a space just the size and shape of the chosen man, is left untouched. The Almighty could carry out His plans just as well if that par- ticular person were killed, he could raise another in his stead, but lie chooses to show his mercy. He chooses to answer prayer. In famine, the righteous and wicked suffer privation together, but "I have never seen the righteous forsaken. nor his seed begging bread." This cannot be said of the careless wicked. But in wmr the righteous man is sometimes u slain with the wicked. When any man goes tc war for selfish or foolish purposes, what- i ever his ftate may be, lie cannot claim that 1 his life was given for his country. Yet it \ answers partly the same purlpose for the i  zountry as ifl his motives liad been patriotic; s himself that is the loser, lie (dies a fool, i -  a ransom for the upright. Prov. xxi. Concerning the man who goes wiith  intentioi)s it is dHiferent: his country ( ts by his death, but lie profits more: lie I t enired a sacrifice. it lias been accepled. s s I on the same principle that martyrs die  ior their Faith; and just in proportion as t his motive was pure, lie receives a crown. t This thought leads us to the subject of Re- a demption, which is comparable to many 1 things in life, but greater than them all. It t is an inexhaustible subject, not yet fully un- s derstood.   The patriarchs made it a subject of specu. lation. and the prophets made it a subject of song. The Redeemer himself gave us an * understanding of it, biut left much to try the Faith of His followers. Paul threw much light upon it, and also the other apostles. Since that time it has been studied by the philosopher, who found many precious gems on the shore of its deep, unfathomable sea. The missionary has planted it in the hearts of many people ; the poet has thrown upon it the light of his feelings ; minds cast in different moulds have made investigations; the chain of circumstances, and the many solemn scenes amid which the Offering was accepted, insure it the attention of all. It is a subject affecting the interest of all How deep and intricate, yet how simple and grand! All the new ideas that have been advanced in the course of ages, each of which seems complete in itself, are but the organic parts of the great temple. Future genera. tions will advance yet more new ideas,--and upon such simple grounds that men of the present day will wonder why they were so long overlooked. When the facts discovered through all ages shall be put together--each in its proper place, what a noble fabric it will be I Then it will be seen that it was no " cunningly de. vised fables." A system fabricated by man is soon explored to the bottom, and the sur. face always presents the best view. It can not stand the lapse of time, and the whirl. wind of ideas. But the subject of Redemp, tion grows in beauty as we explore its depths; the flight of time adds to its brightness ; the shock of contending opinions only settles it more firm upon its foundation, and makes it more secure. In this warl'fare we can only catch a glimpse of our King's glory; but when we have won the victory, we "May view the Lamb in his own light, Whom the angels diimly see, And giaze transported at the sight, To all eternity." Selfishness shows itself among soldiers In a stronger liglht than anywhbre else, unless, perhaps, it be in a fiamine, which afllietion has not been a part of my experience. O()ne day there was a fight among some of tHe nien about a very trifling matter. but scltisiili ss is a great magni' ying a lass. Tl'hie circirn. stance. thou]gh not unusual.' led mne into d ep reflectiolln, so nmucl so that I could inot sleep. Durin the nigl-ht, whein everyltling was still, and the silelnce was only br6ken by tile ch]allenge of the sentinel, at dog conmneniced barkiing. Echo answered him.  The dog seemed determined to have the last word, and kept on tarking. lie reminded me of the individual whiose selfislitness had caused the fight of the day. Some selftish people aro always snarling and finding fault, or picking holes in other people's characters. Knowing themselves to be little and miean, they are sure that everybody reads them, and their only comfort is in trying to make others ap.   pear as bad as themselves. Such people, when called to account for any misdemeanor, will always justify themselves by showing that some else has done just as bad. Thie relation of individuals in all stations of life is such. that sometimes one must do more than another. In battle, one must be more exposed 'than another. In work, there will often be something disagreeable to do, that cannot be equally divided. What falls to one at one time, may fall to another, at another time, but there will never be a time when all have done exactly alike. When the disagreeable work falls on a good man, he dues it and says nothing about it; but when t falls on a selfish man, he imagines that he fs wronged, and frets, and scowls, and com- mits depredations on others, supposing they nave first injured him. Echo answers, and the dog barks again. Thus the contention, started by one man's selfishness goes on, and increases in importance, till it ends in a great deal of harm. Every one should be content to bear what- ever falls to his lot, and if it be that he is wronged by the one immediately over him, who is liable to err, there is One who over- looks all matters, and straightens all busi- ness ; He will count it in the man's favor who has borne seeming evils in patience. When He takes the business in hand they are no longer evils; the man then appears just so mochma benefactor.  'he soldier is not altogether confined to the dark view of life ; there are many noble  deeds performed that are like so many lamps  in a dark wilderness. Friendships are here t formed that never die; deeds of charity, of r patience, of meekness, of mercy, are per- t formed, which show that the Holy Spirit i operates on all hearts,          t The respect shown to a flag of truce, is a C wonder to the savage, who knows only hatred c and revenge. Yet this is another proof that b Love, and friendship, and Mercy, are not u atogether rooted out, even by the ravages tl of a cruel war. It shows that even while t] imen disagree, and strive for the mastery, p they acknowledge themselves to be brothers. si Paul numbers truce-breakers among   the n worst of characters , The whole universe is one great brother- s1 hood: the Great 3Being exists fr the good of all. If His creatures were free fromi sin, tl and, consequently, from selfish desires, each  would exist for the good of all. That is the o object for whicli each one was created. But ot since most men are selfish, there are'very qi few left to work for the general good. , 'See- n tarianismn thinks it ihas done enough when it fl has secured the welfare of its own members, ar Christianity works for the good of those who ar are trying to overthrow it.        w; God has been merciful to His people, and su tells them, " Freely ye have received, freely th give." In obedience to this, Christianity in takes in its repentant foe, makes common wl cause with him, and lets him  have all the a   benefit of its past labors, just as if he had to   e, 'always been'true. So the laborer that corne )r, in at the eleventh hour receives the same as ig the one who bore the burden in the heat of the day. Anything less than this would be is selfishness, which cannot make common cause lo with anything. )e  A flag represents a nation as one brother re hood: it carries great moral force, protecting o, the citizen in foreign lands. Whoever dis. Is honors it is an enemy to the whole nation. t A. weak force, whether on land or sea, may e not be able to hold up its flag; it may come e to the point that the only way to save their e lives is to haul it down. And yet these very n men, may have sworn to be true. This e seems like breaking the oath. But it is only i- an acknowledgment that their flag (their y brotherhood) cannot protect them at all i times and places. ,  But in hauling down the flag, they throw I themselves upon the protection of a stronger t brotherhood-that of the whole human race. Wherever the influence of Christianity has - reached, the moral force of that brotherhood s (though represented by no flags) is sufficient to stay the passions of their enemies. But where it has not reached, there is no such - restraint. The nation is a brotherhood, so is the Church. The band that binds the Ination together is national pride; by being )one people 'they have more happiness (and influence) than if they were divided into dif- ferent tribes: one helps the other. But with the Church it is not the strength of union that creates happiness ; if the whole world could have united together to destroy the power of sin, it would have been vain without some outside help. The builders of tile Tower of Babel attempted this, but the impious act was not allowed; they tried in their own strength. The CONDESCENSION of Christ is the unspeakable gift; His suffering creates our happiness, and His Love is the bond that unites the Church. This bond of union is stronger than that of kindred, and the advantages are infinitely greater than those of nationality. There are times and places where the power of a nation is not sufficient to help its members; then they may honorably haul down the flag and throw themselves upon the protection of the stronger brotherhood. But there is no place so desperate that the King of kings cannot give assistance. When there is no other way to help each othler, then Christians can pray for each otlher, and it wisdom dictates it, the Con quteror will bring deliverance. The Christian need never haul down his colors; there is no flag of truce with the powers of darkness; and the alternative is always either victory and deliverance, or a soldier's death. Life was made tolerable amid the evils of war by such reflections as these: but at times the thoughts of the evils were uppermost in my mind; then I shuddered at the account which those must give, who wantonly suffer a war to be begun when they have influence to use against it.     The kings of old made war for glory; but when they came to a dying bed, what honors were there brought back fresh to their memory I The dying warrior thinks of the souls that were in one day hurried into the unknown world, the suffering that was en- dured from mangled limbs; the horror felt by many who had no interest in the battle, as expecting every minute to be crushed by the cannon ball, or torn by the shell. He sees deluded men facing death in hopes of promotion, pushing forward over the bodies of their companions. Hie sees pools of blood here and there upon the ground, he hears the sound of the cannon ball as it crushes through ranks of men and horses. All the mingled sounds and sights of a battle-field must rise up before him. Then he sees little children playing at their homes far away, unconscious that they are orphans. Many that had fathers when the sun arose, are orphans when they go to sleep. Many orphans, many widows, are sometimes made in one day ; their cry reaches the ears of the Most High, and his wrath is turned upon the dying warrior, who knew no mercy, but sought for fame, unmindfill of what it cost. As I thought of these things, I prayed for the time to hasten when there would be no war, and was glad when I wasopermitted to return to the pursuits of PEACE. RETURN EARS and months I prayed to be brought back to my loved ones, and my prayer was answered. Truly "His Love has been all around me! I will not try to picture the joy-  the  happiness at again being re- stored to my family. My heart overflowed with thankfiulness, and new reso- lutions were at once formed to regulate my future life.,              1 My wife and children were dearer to me 1 than ever I life seemed to have a charm 1 never known before. T'hough I had been kept well informed by letters, concerning all  that took place at home, the improved ap- 1 pearance of the place made quite an impres- sion on me at my return. My own property, 1 under the judicious  management of Mr. r King, a young man in whom  I placed great confidence, had  increased very much in 1 value, as well by the improvements made, 1 as by   the changing circumstances. As f things were turning  out so well, and the I nature of my duties allowed me much spare t time, I again laid out a plan of study, which a was intended for my direction in the future. r And now it seemed as if all the joys of t life were mine. From  the position I occu- i pied, it was easy to take a more comprehen- c sive view of life than ever before. I could e look back on the scenes through which I r had passed, and enjoy them  over again. i   There were the pleasures of the social circle the pleasures of friendship, the pleasures of traveling, the many views of Mature that had gladdened me in times past, the lessons that had been impressed upon my mind by the force of circumstances, or by some inci. dent. All these were fresh in my memory, and gave me more pleasure now in my leisurely reflection, than when first ex. perienced. I could see the world from different points of view; this was the advantage of a check. ered life. I could look back on the sufferings I had passed through, and make them a source of joy. The sorrow which I had felt at times when a lonely wanderer, turnerd from the door as a vagabond, and the prayers which I offered up as I toiled with a heavy heart, were now brought back to be conu. trasted  with my  present comfort. The pinings of an afflicted heart when I was lonely, were now placed side by side with the affection of my family, and the good wishes of my friends. I could look at the claims of different par. ties and compare them: whereby it was easy to see how a man may deceive himself, and to see what a mean thing bigotry is. Every organization has some word in which it glories. Some of these are nearly contrary to each other, but mostly they are consistent with each other, and could both be adopted by' one party. In cases where they could not be adopted by the same party, the dis- agreement is not likely to be one of princi. ple, but the memory of some disagreement between their forefathers, which came about by one side or the other, acting contrary to their own principles. Take out the disagree. ments that arise from accidental, personal, local, or selfish causes, and most of their theories could be brought to agree nearly enough for all to live by the golden rule. I had been in different countries, and though  not permitted to make many im- portant observations, yet the fact of having been in so many lands, modified my train of thought, and gave me a connected view of things that might appear to bear no com. parison. The habit of thinking about a country before I arrived in it, and comparing my preconceived notion with the reality, gave me such a frame of mind that 1 can think  of other countries from what I have read, and almost imagine myself there. Though sorrow 'had been my   main expe rience, I had tasted many pleasures and taken my choice; and was now enjoying the fruits of a good selection. There was nothing T could wish for but had been enjoyed. For though it had not been my privilege to labor as a missionary in foreign lands, out of my means I had contributed to swell the funds to carry on the work.  I had both time and inclination to make some very interesting calculations, ,which convinced me mnore than ever how easy it would be to send an efficient missionary force to all heathen nations, if people were only in the right frame of mind&   The particulars have been lost as will be seen further on in this narrative. When I looked at my own pleasant situa- tion, and the many blessings which I enjoyed, and considered that it was all secured to me by the suffering and death of Jesus, though I could not see that it would be, any sin to properly use the luxuries of life, the very gratitude'I felt led me to use them sparingly. I looked back again and again at the suffer- ings of my past life, and when I saw how close I had lived to the suffering Saviour under their influence, it seemed as if there was a glory in suffering that I could not find in my present ease. These very sufferings had been the cause of my present happiness; but the privilege of eating and drinking as much as we please, and sleeping on a costly bed if we choose is a poor aim for a life of effort. I looked fi-4her into the subject, and saw that my former suffering had also placed me where I could benefit others; and then I thought if past suffering had done this much, a continuation of the same might accomplish still more. I did not feel like taking life easy if any- thing was to be accomplished by suffering and exertion; I  could not see that any good 4 would come   from  voluntary chastening of i the body, anyfurther than to be temperate in all things, but applied myself more de- I votedly to the duties of my station, laboring hard to make everything work to the ad: I vantage of the most needy, and studying  X out the many revelations which God has r made of Himself to man.          L Things were going on smoothly, and earth a aeeeed to mne a   paradise; my mind was v labored very hard sometimes because there I was so much suffering in the world. One t day the question came to me suddenly, as t] if some one had spoken to me: -You are  q very anxious to benefit others; you can w well afford to be generous while you have plenty; you can well afford to be temperate fr in all things while you have all things to tl taste; but, if it would benefit others, would lc you be willing to have  your property pi snatched away, and yourself a   despised h! vagabond on the earth ?          t Tlen I  said, " Here am I, Lord, as clay in vi thy hands; make me  a   vessel of honor or so dishonor, as Thou seest good." My prop- fo lerty was still increasing in value, and much co of mny business was in other localities. .I of arrived home one day to find my house,and du two or three houses on each side of it. noth- b . ing but smouldering ruins. I  felt that the H time had come for me to see if I could stand m l up to my word to be either a vessel of honor w or dishonor. It only required a   moment's tr thought for me to imagine my ruin com- ra ete; and I   said, " Lord, thy will be done!" WC ir. King came close up to me and said fo x in a   husky voice, "The worst is to come yet." Again I    inwardly resigned myself, thi and said,  Not as I will, but as thou wilt." bit My friend led me into his house, and there the lay the scorched bodies of my wife and five hbu   be children Il  I fell dn my knees and cried out, "O Lord, this is more than I expected I la- This is more than I am ready to bear I!"If ad, I could write down words that would ne scorch the paper, they would not tell the gh anguish of that moment. If all the suffer. to ings of my past life could have been con- ry centrated in a moment's agony, and then y. my body given to the fire, it would only be 'r- a comparison. w  I felt as if the Almighty had become my ur enemy; as if He had cheated me in my de- re votion to Him. I had thought of hunger td and thirst, of heat and cold, of labor and pain, of scourging and fire, of disgrace and se death; but I had never thought of being gener. re ous at the expense of my wife and children. e, I felt as if my Master had said one thing and a done another. I could not say, "Thy will be ,r done;"I could not pray. "r  "Grief," "anguish," are not the words to d express my feeling; it was more like the horror t of a damned spirit as it enters the eternal n world. Kind friends performed the last duties of respect. It was a solemn time to r- all but me. To me it was like tearing the flesh from the bone. As I looked on their 1 disfigured faces for the last time, and as I saw six -coffins let down, hiding all that was edear to me, I  was forced to cry out, "Gone - from me!  Gone from me-so sudden!" i There was no hope now that I would ever meet them again. I  could not pray; I felt as if the Almighty had wronged me; I   felt more like opening my  mouth in cursing and blasphemy   than in prayer. Why did He allow it to be done by such means? Why was it not done more gradually? Why did I  not receive some warning, to prepare for the stroke? Why did I not have time to think about it before it was done? These questions forced themselves upon me, and I was as those who have no hope of heaven. The day after the  funeral many kind friends came to comfort me, but I answered them boldly that it was no use to hope any longer,--either I had sinned to deserve this punishment, or God had wronged me.    -It had not come like the trial that is put upon the Christian to discipline him for the ser- vice of God. Among others came the sneaking villain who had burnt us out be. fore. It appeared afterwards that he had come with a good crowd to fight the citizens of our town; but seeing everything con. ducted with solemnity, he dismissed them, but remained himself to witness my distress. He wore the same  malicious smile, but more intense, and was about to speak a word of comfort. In his face I read the truth-that he had done it. I was despe- rate, because I felt forsaken of God, and it would add nothing to my woe to be hung for this man. I attacked him with terrible fury, feeling that his blood would drown my woe. One blow laid him senseless. I clutched him by the throat, and would have ended his career, but my friends seized me, and dragged me     out of the house, and tried to explain to me how my conduct appeared. But I felt that they too, had turned against me, and used frantic efforts to get back to the man. As my friends held me with strong hands, and I saw that I could not get to him, I jerked my arms free, and gave some severe blows to different ones of my best friends, and had almost reached the man, when I was finally overpowered, and tied, and carried into another room. I struggled hard to get loose, and cursed my friends and everybody I had ever seen, and raved against the Almighty for his in- justice to me. My limbs were cut with the ropes, and I grew very weak. Having been ,in this condition about forty-eight hours, I fell into a troubled sleep. I was haunted with horrible spirits, and awoke to find my- self still tied, and feeling that all had turned against me. But now I was very weak and not disposed to say anything. I lay and thought on my miserable condition, think- ing only of revenge on the man who had done the deed, and hating everybody. When any one came to attend to me I abused him for joining with my enemy. I became weaker and weaker, and my ideas became less and less distinct, until a time when all seems like a blank. When the time came where my memory takes hold again, I was little more than a skeleton, and had n6 strength, nor disposition to think or care about anything. My attention was at- tracted by the smallest trifles, as if I had been a little child. Four months from the time of my misfortune, I was walking about the town, looking at things as if a stranger just entered. By degrees, business matters were suggested to my mind by my friends, andI would sometimes be interested. My affairs had been attended to by the same Mr. King; in his house, also, 1 had been kept during my affliction. He had laid out a plan for building me another house, and to get things straight for me by the time I was ready to take hold of them again. Gradually my faculties regained vigor, so that I could listen to their plans with some interest, yet I planned none myself; for when no one suggested an idea, my mind was turned to trifles as if I had been a child; and like a child, I was heedless of danger. Bnt the memory of my troubles began to make more impression on me, and when Mr. King asked my advice about the house he was building for me, I told him to build it to suit himself-it would never contain me. I wanted to get away from the place as soon as possible; every object, every association, gave me pain. Mr. King asked me what I would do with hmy property if I left. I told him to do what ( he pleased with it: 1 wanted no more to do  with it. I would go as soon as I could trust i myself on a journey. "Which way are you going?" he asked me. I told him 1 did not a know: it made no difference so I went some-  where. When he asked me what he should a   prepare for me to fake along, I told him\only ; a few clothes, what I could carry in my Ihand. I had made up my mind to go on foot, but he and others persuaded me to go ' by water, and laid out a good plan fte- me which I agreed to follow. They advised me to go to a colder country, and spend my time in gunning and trapping. They arranged my clothes to take with me, and put in all my papers, which, by this time had accumulated to a good weight. My health was now good, and my body had become strong, but my mind was inferior to that of a half-grown boy. My attention was mostly taken up with trifles. Before the day came upon which I was to start, Mr. King read to me his plan to dispose of my property. He valued the whole at a certain amount. which he was willing to pay me as I called for it. All that remained in his hands, he was to loan to the most needy as fast as he could raise the money. The interest was to be devoted to good and benevolent purposes. As lie read over the proportion to be given to each cause, he gave a very large proportion to the missionary cause. This he had done to please me. It brought sweet memories back to my mind, and tears came to my eyes, but I was living without prayer. I was pleased with the disposition he had made, but did not want to take part in it. Then he called in several of our friends as witnesses between us, and read it all over again. It was fully understood what he was to do with it. He counted out enough of money to last me about twelve months, gave me part of it, and had the remainder secured in my clothes in such a shape, that it could neither be exposed nor give me in. convenience. The day came; though I had requested nothing but a few clothes, my papers and some books were put with them, and they were all placed neatly in a new trunk, marked with my name and destination. They were put in a carriage. my friends bade me farewell, Mr. King accompanied me to the landing, and once again I was. steaming toward the ocean. BEREFT HE ocean had no charm for me. Not that I was suffering grief, but rather because I had no emotions, no re- gard for anything but trifles. When there was nothing to attract my attention, I only looked about list- lessly, without any emotions or train of thought whatever, and without any object, except to take it into my head at times to play some foolish prank. A certain amount of pain, like a certain amount of labor, will give a person a stronger hold on life. My body had endured just abdut enough of each in my time, to give   me a hold on life: my appetite was very good, and the sea air made me still better; and my body was vigorous. But my mind had been overdone, and was therefore pros- trate. As this prevented me from enjoying life, it also prevented me from suffering. One night while the boat was steaming onward, as I felt very lively, and the night was lovely, I took a notion to walk upon the sides of the boat. I had been enjoying this amusement some time, and had nearly be- come satisfied when my foot slipped and I fell into the water. , I had been an excellent swimmer in my time, but now the art seemed to have forsaken me. I threw up my hands like a person that had never been in deep water before, and tried to call to the boat but my mouth sunk beneath the surface. This was attempted for several minutes, during which time I was splashing and treading water, when the knowledge of swimming seemed to return suddenly. The motion was natural, though no distinct thought on the subject passed my mind. By the time I could hold my mouth clear of the water to call for help, the boat was out  of hearing. Toward the sunset there was a light which  I knew to be a light-house. I struck out  boldly for the light without thinking to ] calculate the chances of gaining it. I was i many miles from shore-how many I cannot E tell. ' he wind was eastward, and though not very strong, it was a good help, each wave X throwing ine nearer and nearer to the shore. t Yet, if I had been in my right mind, I would l have despaired of life. At first when I saw i that the boat kept right on, and no one re- s turned any answer, I felt uncomfortable; but a nothing like what might be expected from a h man in my situation. I instinctively struck s out for the shorle, just like a boy that might m be bathing, and think he has ventured far a enough. As I began to grow tired. my mind w rose to the necessity of tie occasion, and I n began to feel that animation which one ' always feels when trying his strength. But k after awhle I grew faint; fear for the first time took hold of me, and I began to realize g my situation as a man in his senses would sl do. Feeling my helplessness, I instinctively ic (?) exercised FAI'TH, but uttered no formal fc prayer. A' last I began to feel as if I could hold n( out no longer; but calculated this much,- w that as thie waves were carrying me ashore, Ir I could afford to rest my oars. As I threw m back my head to float, it flashed in my mem- ory that Mr. King had taken the precaution fo to fasten a life-preserver on me. It took but lt little trouble to get it filled, and from that h time I felt easier, and struck out again when ha I had sufficiently rested.        p I reached the shore next day, late in the in afternoon. There was no light-house near, th as I had   not drifted directly toward it an Neither was there rly  dwelling in sight. a Weary and hungry, I threw  myself on the of   ry sand, not knowing what else to do. I was r; soon chilled through, and rising to my feet, nd started on, being a little rested, but having Ds- a dreadful gnawing of hunger. I had gone ng but a short distance, when I was compelled to rest again. This time I was sheltered by ig bushes. I thought the best thing I could do ht would be to take off my clothes and wring me them. When I put them on again I wai is cold, but started on without any path, feeling e- my way through the bushes. I made but I little headway, and soon came to a swampy it place, where, feeling around in the dark for' d some time, I could find no way to get aroun Is it. Weary and disheartened, I sought a dry p spot, and throwing myself down, slept tin t, morning. e. I was shivering with cold when I awoke, s, but felt a little refreshed. It did not take me d long to find the way around the little swampy f spot, and I pushed on, hoping to come to e some road. I soon struck into a cattle-path t that ran through the woods, and following this, I came in sight of a small house.  went to the door and asked for something to t eat. The woman prepared some food for me without hesitation. The man tried to ques- i tion me, but I only told him I had had bad t luck this time. 1 do not suppose it gave him any definite idea, but he saw I was too weary to answer questions, and he was kind enough to ask no more. It was the most delicious food I ever ate, and every mouthful called forth inward thanksgiving. I ate all that was set before me, and could have eaten as much more, but it is well enough that I did not. I felt very sluggish after eating, and lay down and slept about an hour. When I awoke the man had gone; I asked the woman if she could sell me a pair of shoes, the gaiters which I wore on the boat being too tender to do mat any good. She could not do it unless he was home. I then asked her if she could let me have some bread to take along with me. This request she granted, I paid her for her kindness, and continued on my journey. It did not take long to wear out my gaiters, but it was not many miles to a store. There I bought some more provis ions, and a pair of shoes, and sought a plac. for sleeping. As it was late at night when went into the store, and as I took pains to not let my face be seen too plainly, ther were no questions asked about my business In this way I travelled for some days and for many miles. After my spirits were revived with the first food I  ate, and the sluggishness which followed had worn off, I felt thankful to God for having preserved my life, and felt that He had not forsaken me. Some events of my past life were brought to my remembrance in such a way as to touch my heart. I thought of my father and mother, my wife and children, and had a desire to-meet them again. So thankful was I to the Preserver of my life, that I could not but utter my     thankfulness as in times past, and I felt encouraged to pray for a meeting with my loved ones. My heart was warmed as I felt the sooth- ing influence of the Comforter in answer to prayer, and I looked on spiritual things as I had done in times past, I felt that He did really forgive me for my resistance and blas- phemny. I again offered my whole soul and body a sacrifice to Him. I was now deter- mined, though not in my own strength, to submit to whatever might be His will-how- ever unexpected, and this feeling of re-union with Him now, and the hope of seeing my loved ones that had been snatched away, brought many tears of joy. And I said, "Now, O Lord, I believe Thou wilt take me where I can join them." But to the world I was dead. I tiaveled on without any object in view but to follow my thoughts. There was one thought now troubled me; that was having left my papers on board the boat. I have learned since, that some man, having found out my name and destination, pretended to be my brother, and obtained the trunk and its contents. I would say however, that it is the second time in my life that I have lost all my papers, and know very well they can be of little profit to any one else. If any person has any papers in his possession which he thinks to be those I am speaking about, I take this opportunity to let him know that a reward is offered for them. He may advertise in an assumed name, and I will address him by mail, and tell him my plan to recover them, and to send him the money. There need be no fear, as I have no ill-feeling; my only object being to obtain the papers. They would help my memory, which unaided, is very obscure on some points. While traveling in this mood without any object in view, a storm of rain came on. I had thus far mnagaged to attract but little attention, but the storm caught me where I could find no shelter, except where I would be likely to be discovered. I was also badly in need of a good warm meal. I came to a small house on the side of a creek; I knocked at the door and was welcomed in. When I had dried myself thoroughly, supper was on hand, and I partook with them. They told me if I could be content with their accommodation, I was welcome to stay until the storm was over. The house was occupied by a young couple with no child. The man had several occupations, the most prominent one being that of a fisherman. I was not very communicative about my own affairs, and though they both seemed interested to know more about me, they kindly abstained from asking questions. Yet there was something in both of them that won my confidence. Though the bed they gave me was not costly, it was the best 1 they had, and their manner plainly showed  they felt glad to do me a favor.  I would have slept soundly, but for the    first time since my troubles, I felt inclined to lay some plan for the future. The esteem I had for my new acquaintances seemed in- separable from the idea of a plan for the future, and before my eyes were closed in sleep, a plan was fully matured in my mind When I awoke there was the smell of break fast in the room, and as soon as I was ready we all took seats at the table. Matters in general were discussed, but no questions asked me about my former life. After breakfast the man went out to see about his boat, and I went with him. I asked him how much it was worth. He named the sum it cost him when it was new. I asked him how much he would take for it now. He looked at me with surprise; then his countenance changed, and he gave me a searching look. He asked me if I wanted to buy it. I told him I did; and that I wanted him also to buy me a gun, and some ammu- nition. Then he made some inquiry about my former life. "Can you keep a secret?" I asked: I already knew he could, but this was said to introduce the subject. He gave me another long and searching look, as if to pronounce upon my character. "I'll tell you what it is, my friend," said he, " if you have any dark work on hand I can't sell you the boat, and want 'you to go somewhere else to 'find a partner." I then told him if he would listen to me I would let him know all, and then he might judge for himself. ", Then if you are going to tell us we'll go into the house; my wife will like to hear it, and will keep it as long as I will." I could not doubt that his wife was worthy of confidence, and I accompanied him in. He informed her in a few words what was to be done, and that she was expected to keep silent about it. She promised to do so. and was all attention. I told a great deal of my life to the attentive pair, and they seemed to have great sympa- thy for me. I then made known my plan: it was to follow gunning, fishing. and trapping, and to malke a shelter in some unfrequented spot. I desired him to be the umedium through which 1 would communicate to the world; I subscribed for several papers which were to come in his name. I had intended to try them to see how long their fidelity to me would last; but my heart was so full of thankfulness for the many blessings I had received, my confidence was so fully awak- ened in them both, and 1 felt so much like doing something to benefit others, that I made up my mind to do them a kindness at once. It was only a few days before I put into action a plan which I had intended to postpone for a year. This was to send to Mr. King for a certain amount of money, and place it in the hands of my new friend. It took some time and a great deal of care to accomplish this, but the money came safely, and I placed it in what I believed to be faithful hands. When I saw the effect it produced, I was very thankful that it was 1ii     still in mny power to do good. They are now living on a place of their own, a picture of content. It did not take me long to put allmy plan into operation. I found a convenient place to make a shelter in the woods, I enjoyed myself sailing about the bay, and exploring different parts for a more obscure retreat. The game I had for sale was taen by my friend, and their worth returned in goods such as I wanted, or in money. T'hrough the newspapers I was kept informed of what wVas going on in the world, the exercise was good for my health, and gradu ally restored my mind to a healthy tone. r!hings now being arranged, as I supposed, for life, my thoughts were turned more fully upon Divine things. I did greatly condemn myself for having resisted the will of m Maker, and truly my suffering had bee severe. But I was not satisfied to let it rest there. I wanted to probe it to the bottom I felt it was not enough to submit to His will, and then live in retirement, and tal I life easy. This kind of life was the very I means to restore my mind to its powers, and even my devotions were not of a kind to " draw too hard upon it. While meditating I  came to the following conclusion:-"When  I see Jesus on the cross with my unholy eyes, and embrace his feet, and wash them  in tears of penitence, then shall I be sw T, lowed up, and feel my true relation to Him." A Then I thought of his goodness in sparing  me through the war; I thought of the years and months I had prayed to be brought back aogain, and how his Love had been m manifested in many turns of Providence I: then when I remembered that it was not to th elnjoy my family long, I said :--"T'hough He slay me I will trust in Him. I know that I shall meet them all again. In this life inconvenience is an element of man's proper condition. Sorrow is better than laughter." In the meantime I searched out a place for a more retired shelter, where no human being would be likely to interrupt me. Sometimes I would hide my boat along the shore, and go as far as some village or store after night, and buy such things as I wanted. It did not take much searching to find a spot suited to my notion, and there I pro- eeeded to arrange matters for a permanent home. Then I changed my fishing and trapping places, and spent more time in the, cave. Much of that time was spent in de- votion. At times the loneliness of my situ- ation and the memory of my troubles, crowned with the great trouble, would come over me with such force that I could only find relief in making it a permanent form of devotion. On one of these occasions I thus gave vent to my feelings:          f "I am alone upon a barren isle, Where desolation reigns, to stay awhile; world Around me all is darkness, and before, and Par in the distance, is the eternal shore.  and   y are J"Gloom and thick darkness hover o'er these rocks cture I look, my searohing eyes the darkness mocks; And all is silent but the murmuring waves, 1 my That sing the requiems o'er ten thousand graves. nient ,fO'ershadow'd by this darkness and this gloom, ds, ISo far away from Heav'n, my future home, and 'T is only by the eye of Faith I see clure The glorious land-the mansion there for me. d in  "How long, Lord, have I to suffer here?

"m Then nerve me up, thou God and Mighty Man, '- To carry on the work on thy wise plan. ' And, though I'm nothing but a feeble worm Oh I may I firmly stand through all the storm ," it  On another occasion, viewing the time of i my ups and downs as a speck of time long past, I thus expressed my estimation of earthly to things h    "Things present now will soon be o'er As all things that have paseed before, To be remembered here no more. n   "Some men attempt to gain a crown, Or weave a wreath of great renown; All that man builds must tumble down. "They struggle hard, but nothing gain, Their hopes are realized in pain, Or swept down by the moving train "The mighty caravan goes by,-.- All things must pass, and so must I, And millions yet unborn must die. "What lives, and acts, and shines to-day, To-morrow will have passed away; And short on earth will be my stay. "Few vestiges are left behind Uninjured by the waves of time, And few wiH care to notice minc. "Oblivion! oh, delightful thought! When all my work on earth is wrought, My sins will all be turned to naught!" I felt that it would not do for me to bury myself in a cave. I felt that these sentimens must be put into exercise in contact with the world.  I looked back upon my past life and  saw that I had been maltreated   by many; but this I felt was no reason to re      main in seclusion. I believed that now my mind and body had regained their energy, I must come forth and mingle with men. The duty was urged by the following senti- ment : "I am naturally a target for some to shoot at, and a scape-goat to suffer for the faults of others : but this must not stop me; I must bear with the weak, for they know not what they do. In this way I can be one with Hiim who bore with the weak and ignorant Beo far as to pray for those who drove t-he nails: yet He will tread down his enemies-- all who wilfully oppose his reign." Having first arranged the cave in order, and put the ooak 'r. care of my friend, I started forth with tnes. sentiments, and without any particular place in view, I went empty handed,'with only one suit, but had a little money. My intention was to inquire for work until Ifound it. The route I took was a crooked one: most of the people treated me kindly, and offered me provisions to take along. I told them I was not asking for charity, but for the opportunity to labor. Some excused themselves, and said they hoped I did not think they meant it for charity, yet they forced me to take some- thing along with me. After much traveling I came to a place where they directed me to the most prominent carpenter of the village. To him I applied for worlk. He looked at mne very hard for a few seconds, then said he would try me for a short while. With tools once more in my hands, I felt better, I labored with due energy, and my employer was pleased witih mne; but to all his questions I only answered that I was an honest man. and had seen much trouble. The most of his work was in the shop; there was no work to do at this time at a distance from home; I was therefore brought but little in contact with men, except those idlers who had nothing to do but hang around and entertain everybody in lhearing with their un- profitable talk. ,When they spoke to me, I tried to answer them in such a way as to make an impression. There was opportunity to attend to my devotions in my own room, and to a certain extent while at work. I spoke but seldom, and tried to speak to the purpose. My love of nature led me to a grove some distance from the village, of evenings, and some idlers followed me there several times. Soon it was eported that I had escaped from some lunatic asylum, and some, as if to make me speak before I had time to think, would suddenly ask me such questions as "how long have you been out?"The idlers, men and boys, began to sing out disagreeable names, and my situation became daily more and more uncomfortable. The doctor of the zleighborhood, a wealthy man, came and talked with me several times; he told me he  wokld give me a home in his house until he oould see what he could do for me; he i imagined he had an interesting case on hand.  He even told me that if he could do me no   r r good, he would pay my expenses in an asy- , lum, where everything would be done for me  that human wisdom could dictate. I thanked - him very politely, and told him there was but one Physician could help me, and when t I needed an asylum, I could pay my own ex- Fpenses. People asked my employer about me; he t told them I was a good workman, but had t strange ways. I had come out into tlhe L world, to face the world; for one of my forms of devotion was;-"During this stormy life - I must face a frowning world." I was de- bating in my mind whether it were consistent with duty to leave this place, or try to act so in accordance with the people's notions, that they might think better of me. T"his was a difficult question; and I was not permitted to decide it by meditation, before Providence decided it for me in a prompt manner. The continual teasing had worked upon my nerves, which were very easily unstrung ever since the fury I felt at the sight of the villain who burnt my house and family. This irritability led them to try to vex me more.  One evening my proper business called me to walkl through a part of the village, to go to a shop on another road. It was customary among the boys of that place, for each to carry a walking-stick with an awi in the end of it. As I passed the corner, a flock of boys pressed around me, and com- menced to stick those awls in my flesh. It required great presence of mind to control my feelings, but I believed this was a trial that was intended for me to bear, and I spoke to the boys kindly. They would have troubled me no more, but were encouraged by some men close by, to repeat the outrage: they now stuck the awls still deeper in my flesh and the pain was too much for me to endure. I thought I could outrun the boys, and started with sufficient speed. The boys and men now chased me, yelling out " stop thief! stop thief!" and seemed to enjoy it as great sport. Several men rushed out of a store as I came along, and one of them planted himself in a position to seize me. It was no time to stop and think what was best, and besides that, my blood was heated, my patience was tried, and my whole system was excited. As he made his grab, I gave him a blow with fill force, which laity him on the ground. My feeling was one of anger, then of triumph. Instantly the cry of murder was raised, and the whole village came flocking together. Some tried to stop me, and some kept close to the fences as if a tiger had been loose. Stones were showered after me, and several struck me, but the severest blow was from a heavy stone from behind, striking me in the hollow of the knee. It took all power of that limb from me, and in a minute I was seized by half a dozen strong arms. The mob followed on excitedly, some cry ing out to hang me, others to burn me, but some insisted on having a "bear dance." They led me on slowly, or rather carried me,   for I had but one limb to walk on. In the meantime there was a great deal of whoop- ing and yelling kept up all the way. The crowd was graced with the presence of some of the "most respectable citizens," and a number of "ladies." They led me out about a mile from the village, and turned into a grove which was used for pic-nics, bear dances, and other amusements. They built four small fires f)rming a square about ten yards each way. I stood in agony of mind, not knowing what was to be done with me. All I could do was RAY silently, but that comforted me very little; I would have tried to Submit to any death, however horrible, for it was to this ny mind had been 'made up. But I had given way to anger, and under its influence had knocked a man senseless. Oh! I thought, what would I now give to recall  that one burst of passion? True, the blow  was in self-defence, but the spirit in which it 1 was given, that was my error. The idea of being roasted to death for giving way to anger, and then go into eter- i nity without forgiveness!!!! It was a horrible moment. It was TIIEN I saw the l evil of committing the first sin! If I had a been resigned to God's will when He took my t family from me, I might have looked on r their murderer without giving way to 1] passion; I might have proceeded in calm- ; ness, and procured his execution, but now E he triumphed, and I was brought to ruin. u I resisted the Divine Will first; a degree of grace was taken from me; that made me  n weak, so that anger overcame me, and once tl having got the mastery, it kept it long. r They took me in between the four lights fe and now I was more impressed with the th number of faces revealed than before. Ith thought if I would say something, there wi might possibly be one heart in all that w] assembly that would be moved, and pult in B. one plea for me. But the man who took the m lead of the mob said, "too late to speak no now," and addressed me by a very disre- co spectful name. Then some one in the crowd Tl said, "we want you to dance old fellow." wa Pour of them commenced to strip me of my Hi clothes, which I resisted with all my might sti This raised a great laugh, and some of them  said, "you had better save your strength see - for the dance, old fellow," and others called of me by the worst of names.         c When they had taken off all my clothes, gr each hand was tied to the end of a stick, a I which was long enough to keep them wide str apart, a rope was then tied to the middle of the the stick and fastened over the limb of a tree, fail just high enough to let one foot touch the anc ground at a time. All the time of this anc plreparation, I was in great anguish of mind to I at the suffering before me, but felt a little the relieved, hoping that as they were using so tha much formality, they did not intend to take sho my life. My wrists were cut very badly ano with the ropes, and kept me continually on making an effort to touch the greund with ewa   the both feet ; but it was impossible to tauch it oop- with more than one at a time. When my The body was raised clear of the ground, they )me set up a great shout and laughter. As my 1 a writhing in pain, and my efforts to .relieve my wrists by resting part of my weight on the the ground, kept up a see-saw motion, and was let first one foot and then the other touch her the ground, they continued to shout for res, some minutes. ay.  Then all stood outside of the lights except hat two men: one of them sung a song and beat JaS with his hands and feet, while the other ap- ,ry plied a switch sharply to my body; this he ny did in such a manner as to make the writh is ings represent dancing. 'LThe formality with ad which all this was done, led me to believe that ce it was a regular custom in that locality. The I song seemed to be one that was sung on no all other occasion, as it was about mnaking some Dw one dance against his will; and besides this it the skill of the man who used the switch was greatly praised,-as they said he knew or just where to strike to mlake the most grace- 'r- ful movements. a  Tle limb which had received the heavy he blow withl the stone was very much swollen, d and the man excused himself very politely y to the " ladies and gentlemen," as one of the n " animal's" limbs was a " quaker," therefore, ho he could only dance well on  one side. W- ;Vhile suffering these tortures, I thought of w Him who had suffered more for me, yet  unlike me He had suffered without sin. f  Great as my sufferings'were, they were e made many times worse by the memory of e that sin, and I heartily repented, but feared repentance had come too late. I was suf- ', fering too much to know what to think on the subject, and I prayed to the One above [ that my life might be spared. I heartily wished I had gone on my own responsibility i when the missionaries had rejected me in Borneo. 1 know that, whatever the heathen might have done to me, it could have been no worse  than what I now suffered, and could not have been half so humiliating. l Then I might have died with honor, now it was to be in disgrace. Yet I submitted to Him and said, "qThy holy will be done " and still inwardly prayed for forgiveness. Ihe whipping continued very long it seemed to me, but I can form no estimate of time. At last I became senseless. When consciousness returned, I was lying on the ground, with my hands tied to one end of a pole and my feet to the other. . Th"is stretched me at full length. The most of the crowd had gone, and I suppose the fainting was the end of the regular perform. ance. There were now about two dozen men and boys left, and they said they were going to give me a "' ducking" for my health before they let me go home. One of them suggested that, as I had one such handsome leg, they should make the other one like it. Then another took a stick and gave me a stroke  I on the other. knee, which made me faint  way.   .          When I returned to consciousness one man was at each end of the pole, and they were carrying me farther into the woods. I hung in agony, wishing that death could re- -lieve my sufferings, yet praying that my life  might be spared. I paid little, attention to ,anything till they brought me to a narrow stream of water; then the two men- stood at the edge of the water and commenced to swing me as if preparing to throw me in. I was still in hopes my life would be spared, out my hope was not in man. Some one said I would float; then another took two stones and tied them in handkerchiefs, and put one at each end of the pole. They went through this performance'with all the cool- ness of ordinary business. I could not be- lieve they intended anything more than to terrify me. The thoughts of lying on the. bottom  of that creek, with the water over me, was too horrible to think of. It was none the less horrible because the water was shallow. They then took me up again, and com- menced swinging me in the same manner as before. No one can imagine the horror of that moment. I tried to commit myself to God, yet I was filled with horror. After swinging me a few times more, they let me fly from their hands, and I fell helpless to the bottom. People have represented drown- ing as a pleasant death. It was not so to me. If I had been in some river, free to struggle, and been overpowered, the attempt might have lessened the horror of the few minutes. But to be helpless and   know that if you were on your feet ydn could have air, which is now the most desirable of all things, to struggle for air and  not get it, when you i know it is within three feet of your mouth, is a feeling no one need wish to experience. I It has been represented also that all the deeds of your life rise up before you. With me it was different; it was myself that was u presented as a finished piece of mechanism,  and, in this sense, all the deeds of my life 1 may be said to have been before me; all I the  influences of my life were seen at a  glance in the part they had taken in forming 1 this piece of mechanism.  At first the suf-  fering was violent,-worse than any bodily i suffering ever felt before. But, as the strug.  gle grew less and less violent, it seemed as f I were freeing myself from the jaws of l ome   monster, which gradually slackened t his efforts, and at last ceased. Then it was ( that the clear view of the piece of mechan- N ism  came  before me.  The next thing I i knew, I was in a bed with curtains around it, a and heard soft whispers. I could not thinkl i where I  was, and did not try very. hard,- ail my  energy seemed to be concentrated in r the involuntary motions which accompany I life, and in holding body and soul together. -h After some time  the curtains parted, and t a  woman's face looked in upon me. Then t she left the bed, and returned again in a u ,minute, and placed something to my   nose c which had a  very pleasant smell, and made c   a me feel better. Gradually strength returned, r and I was able to eat something; and it seemed as if she knew just what to prepare. For many days did that woman attend to all my wants with the true Christian spirit, for she certainly had no expectation of earthly reward. It is now necessary to go back and explain  some matters which I did not know about until after the events above related. This woman's husband had been a poor man who owned several acres of ground. His more wealthy neighbors had used great endeavors to prevail on him to sell it, to join 'to the large farm, as they thought it spoiled the' looks of a country to be divided up in -little patches. When no amount of persuasion could induce him to part with his home, he found himself in a very uncomfortable situa- tion; being compelled to live as if he had settled in some wild country, and was com- pelled to carry his marketing to a larger town some distance'off, which he reached by water, in his own boat. He had two daughters, and the mother and daughters cheerfully helped to till their little piece of ground. K, ey made a com- fortable living, notwithstaiLding the depreda- tions that were committed upon them by the "most respectable citizens," to  force them to leave the country. When the man died, the widow hardly knew what to do; it was certain she could not get the worth of their home, and she did not wish to start out into the world so little removed from beggary. She resolved to face the storm, and stand in her little home. She had no friends in her own neighbor. hood, but had many in the town, where she was known as the market woman. She and her daughters could till the land, manage the boat, and  sell in market. This she thought was better than being turned adrift upon the world. The neighbors circulated scandalous tales in connection with the names of this mother and daughters. Not long before I came into the neighborhood, a circumstance took  place, which confirmed them all in the minds of those who only wished for some excuse for their bad treat- ment of her, that they might, with a good (?) conscience, join in the general outcry. There was an old lame  beggar who m-ide his appearance in the streets of the village; the boys used him very roughly, and no one would take him in from the cold weather. While searching for shelter, in the woods, near this widow's house, her dogs saw him, and would have ended his days but for the interference of the lady herself. She kindly gave him a shelter for the night, and the next day he was seen leaving her house. It was for this reason the mob *had brought me to her house, and told her 'there was a beau for her and her daughters, that he was very handsome, had only been under the water fifteen minutes, and if she could restore him, she would have the more claim on his affections.   This kind lady and her daughters went to swork immediately. and restored me to anima. tion, notwithstanding the merriment of the crowd, firom  the fact that my body was entirely nude. When the signs of life be- ,came certain, the crowd left the house, wish- ing her much joy. and promising to giwe her a surprise party before long. She kept her pistols in readiness, and her dogs in the house, thinkingc they meditated more mis- e nief: but my opinion is, they knew her too well to attempt anything more at that time. "hey did not disturb her any more. She went out to the place where the fires had been made, and found my clothing scattered in different directions; but it was some time before I could bear them on, as my body was lacerated with many sores. Those made by the awls were the last to get well. When I could go on my feet, both knees were stiff, and my motion was very slow As I spent my time in attending to such trifles as a person in my condition could do my body and mind regained their full power, with the exception of my knees being, stiff. It was necessary for me to go on crutches. I tried to prevail on the widow to sell out I ,and go to a better country. She urged her f reasons for staying. I then offered to do some- i thing for her out of my means ; at first she did i not believe me, but afterward consented to a leave the country, declaring, however, that she X would not sacrifice the home of her husband. q There was a young couple in the town where she attended market, that had no par- i ticular home or business. The widow went i and   saw them, and proposed to leave the h place just as it was, and rent it to them for a d certain sum. They agreed to the proposal. o When everything was arranged, she shut up p the house, left the dogs plenty to eat, and b then the three women and myself, four good sailors, set sail for the town. The money h was paid, the young couple returned in the ii boat, and the lady and her daughters took b passage in a  steamboat, with the intention h of going to the town where I had been burnt t( out. I  gave them a letter to Mr. King, stated r( what I wished him to do for them, and told hm where to address me next. I have heard g] since, that the daughters are both married. a I  took passage to the city of B ---, thence te tc a  point where I could easily reach my th friends of the Chesapeake. I  took my boat, it and returned to the cave, with the intention fe of making that my home till death, unless to Providence should otherwise decree.    fe sa THE CAVE.         St]   Y   plan was to lay in provision as if I had been going to sea, that my  fish- ha ing   and trapping might be more a lin ^  recreation than a   necessity. I ar- M 'e/- ranged my affairs so that the rule aD '  of one day would be the  rule of wh every day, (except the sabbaths.) in   to  A number of reasons unite to convince m- me that this is the most suitaDle place for he me. My past experience has either been ts as be permitted to arrive almost at. the posses. ,e- sion of an object. and when it was almost in h- my grasp, to have it snatched away; or if I er seized it at all, it would be to lose it soon. er But now the very desire of heart is the object ' ie upon which I can fix all my attention. In s- the outer world tlhere is a consuming care, eo which prevents me from following a thought e. to its end; there 1 must put in my time e trimming the branches; here I can probe to d the root.  'rhouh I love my fellow-menl, it d is not in accordance with my  present state e of mind to mix with them. and engage in s general conversation; and there is no station y in life but would make this more or less necessary. s  In the cave I feel at home.   T have the r. comforts of life, no fear for the future, and can h follow the inclination of my mind, knowing , that it is in my power to benefit somebody. W, hen I became once established, there were  some months spent in close application. It is surprising how memory will recall events t that have been forgotten; during the time rspent in this manner, I was no farther away from  the cave than the spring. Spent I in this economical manner, a few months seemed like a   life-time. It almost seemed as if the events of my past life were a dream, and I had always been in the cave. The storms  of many winters have beat upon me. Gray hairs are on my head, and my days cannot be many. My  weary limbs have carried me many leagues. I  have had dealings with many kinds of people. I  have observed, and reflected,;-but what have I performed? How few have been benefited by my existence I The world is full of misery. It was in my heart to lessen pain: but I was an outsider in almost every circle of friends. I was blunt in speech, and abrupt in manner. I have seen youth rushing into snares. I tried to warn them; I spoke, and my effort was received with laughter. My childhood was spent in obscurity. I grew into the habit of locking up my thoughts, and shrinking from the gaze of others. I took no pleasure in conversation. Since then, I have come in contact with many; but it added little to my pleasure; I spoke but few words, and when alone again, returned to my cogitations. When I traveled I formed few acquaintances, spoke only when neces. sary, but observed all. Since thinking it over, it seems plain that casual words have an influence,-sometimes even more than studied sentences. I hope that my words have done no evil. The winter of life is on me; my leaves have faded and fallen. The snow covers my limbs. 1   was most at home among strangers. My influence was absorbed, because I was always in the minority. My thoughts, even when founded in truth, were scoffed, if not in accordance with the prevalent notions of     the community I was in. What was a re- spectable custom in one place, would be ridi- culed in another. I was seldom troubled with questions. But I will leave the cave, and wander out among the trees, to obtain rest from this dark prospect. It is summer evening. The hallly- air, the humming of insects, the *night-hawk searching for his prey,--these take me back to that summer of my early youth, when I went every evening to the widow's house, to do some trifles of work. She had seen sorrow. She said many things that caused me to think. I learned to feel for others. but not as I do now. From her I listened to many, a tale of woe. One evening when I had prepared the wood, brought the water, and cared for the animals. she I old. me of a man whllo worked so hard to please his landlord, that he broke a blood-vessel, and died, leaving his wife desolate. lhis children orphans. The boys were bound out to hard masters, they were educated go irregularly as to perplex them, leaving themn to think that, common learning was too high for them. "I He was foolish to do it!"I exclaimed, "I would do that for no man." "Neither did he intend it, my child," said the lady, "he was raised in ignorance; he knew nothing of the weakness of the human frame; he only thought of his little ones, whom lie wished to give better advantages than himself. His landlord was that stamp of man who has no sympathy with the suffer- ing poor; he looked upon them as made to labor that his flesh might be pampered the more; and all he knew was to get as much work out of them as he could. He was never satisfied, and always required more than what had been performed.  After trying a man for awhile, he would turn him off let him do as he would, that the next poor soul, glad of the chance to toil, -might be moved to put forth still greater efforts. "I need not have been a  widow, my chil- dren need not have been orphans, but for this oppression; he who was a murderer from the beginning, is the author of selfish- ness- -the cause of oppression. Samuel was an infant then; I kept him with me, and gave him what education I  could, but the rest are doomed to go the way of their father. You are a, good boy to come and work for me; you have not yet seen much of the evil ,of life: my  advice to you is this,-Never take sides with the oppressor; do not by your labor, your patronage, or the seeking of his influence, make him more powerful to e oppress: but rather help the weak; help i them, though it bring upon you the enmity a of the oppressor,-DARE TO DO RIGHT. The 1 Mighty One will help you; ' He shall deliver e thee in six troubles, yea, in seven, there } shall no evil touch thee. In famine, H  e i shall redeem thee from death, and in war,  from the power of the sword:"  Job. v. f 19, 20.                 i A I  went home, I thought on this subject C   e- of oppression. Though to me-not a new one, li- it was now presented in a stronger light. I d then thought of what had been said by a rattling old woman in the neighborhood, who it always spoke her mind. When our teacher is was turned out, the one that was so kind to e me, and made all my lessons so easy and e plain, so that under him I learned fast, the e trustees said he neglected his duty; the old y woman said it was because he did not give e all his time to the rich people's children, :. but the rest of the poor said nothing. I s then remembered that when old Col. R-- 1 came to the school-house and talked very r loudly, our teacher told hil in emphatic tones that he would treat all alike. e  As I walked slowly through the woods e that warm evening, I reflected more deeply d than ever before. I stopped; twilight was 3 favorable to my frame of mind. There were e but few clouds in the summer sky. I could 3 see the night-hawk sailing about, and hear e his inquiry for prey; and when he darted , down with his peculiar noise, it did not dis- , turb my meditations. D  The lightning bugs added their charm; r and many other insects kept up a continual hum.   I was a little boy, but the depth of Ihuman woe had been impressed upon me;  and  the 'question kept repeating itself,- l " why is it permitted?"I thought if I were ,a king I could soon rectify such evils. And how many there were in high places that could if they would try I Oh, if some one would take the lead I Just then the thought struck me, there is a Leader; and I felt the necessity of faith in His care. The Leader is actually about the work I wished so much to see done. Many thoughts on the subject have passed through my mind since. The reason why the work progresses so slowly, is because the Leader has left something for each one to do, and we all are so slow about it Any one that goes right to work as the Leader has shown us, and performs the duties belonging to his station of life. will become, by his influence, a leader under the great Leader. A faithful few are doing so; they are the princes, they are the apostles of the age. A few more would multiply-the advantages, until the in. creasing numbers and multiplied influence would lift the race where it could scan great calamity. But in my cave I cannot influence any: am not at ease among my fellow-men: the- noise of the cricket, the rustling of the night wind among the leaves, are more suitable companions for me. The birds sing without fear, and I hear their sweetest songs. The rabbit feeds near me, and gives me no atten- tion. I  would rather see them trust me, than eat their flesh. The study of their habits has taught me many a lesson. They live according to the laws designed by nature, and when danger comes they flee. But my fellow-men know not where their danger lies: they try to shun trouble, and plunge deeper in; they try every way but the right   one; they should be patient under the troubles permitted for their good, but they try to shun them. The relations existing between man and his fellow give rise to these troubles; the settlement of difficulties in the mildest way would call up thevreasoning powers, and lead man into a higher range of thought. This is the design of trouble; but each one looks only at his own side, and " defends" what he calls his " rights." ,Each one defending his "rights" tries to make it as pleasant for himself as it would be if sin were destroyed; and, so far as he carries his point, his fellow must suffer more than his share. This will be true until the present relations cease. Each one shrinking from the pressure outside  encroaches on his neighbor, and troubles arise. Each one should be patient, act with reason, and  discord would cease. These' thoughts arise in every one's mind but no one gives them   expression. There is no mutual understanding, and each one suspicions the other. Every one has serious thoughts at times, but is loath to express 2them, because there is a prejudice against them, unless they proceed from  the clergy.  Common people are expected to think about v nothing  but fun or business; and, if one d gives vent to a serious thought, it often ex- 1 ,ites ridicule, especially among the vulgar. a But the   Spirit operates on every heart; p Arid those thoughts should be spoken out; n she Spirit should not be quenched. Happy  v would it be for many if this custom  were g once adopted.  Nature, now lovely, would a then be more so; then all could enjoy Na- ture.                   ty I   am  desolate, and pine for friendship. p My   life has been one of ups and downs. I w have seen many sorrows. I   felt oppression's h hand upon me; it troubled me to know s whether it were required of me   to bear it tl patiently, or to use my energies to be re- w leased. Was it required of me to bear up 1a under trouble brought about by an unnatu- di ral state of affairs? Was I  made for that gi purpose, while another was made to be my al urden,- to enjoy according to my suffer- we ing? There seems to be no hope for the an poor. If the laborer stops to rest his weary Tl limbs, or bathe his aching head, he is idle. co "Ye are idle," is the cry of old oppressors; do and they tighten the bands. If he labors fri hard, in spite of pain, to try to gain the me oppressor's good-will, the task is still in- tic creased. Thus the bands are tightened from ov one generation to another. There is no oth hope for the poor but in education and self- cis denial.                  if: I reflected, and planned, and labored, and tio saved, but everything seemed to work against bu me,--still  plodded on. At last my efforts' his were crowned with success. I   had gained a of toting his NoW I   hoped the fruit of- my labor would hI be my own, and not my oppressor's. Now Pr I   Iwas encouraged to work harder than ever bee beforef it seemed that diligence was all alla   the that was necessary to make my future path. Ley way smooth. I felt free to work moderately, but my spirits were buoyant, and' it was easy mud to work hard. I could think or sing while ;he at work, and afterward take time to read ray Such was my picture of happiness, and such Mad I enjoyed for a short time. The insect de- his stroyed much of my crops; and thieves ks annoyed me so that my sleep was broken. he My house was burned by an envious man. his Instead of meditation, I had watching, dif 'or culties to overcome, and problems to solve d; It seemed severe that Providence should )w give me disappointment in the moment of ill satisfaction. Yet I was resigned till a worse trouble came. I remembered what I had re seen in the past,-that every man had his id own difficulties to contend with. I saw it it, was the lot of all. Complaints heard long e. before, that had fallen upon my ear as un- d, meaning sounds, now   came to me in full re force.  I could sympathize more than ever we with others, and I found  Many to sympa, is thize with me. Ss  I called to mind the case of a mechanic. At He had started under difficulties like myself; r. at first he could not find enough to do; he it worked cheap, he did it well, he threw out'in. e ducements to customers, and still went be- :- hind. He could not keep his debts paid, and when there was an opportunity for a ; paying job, he could not take it for want of ; material. Thus he kept on, things getting r worse and worse. No one can tell the an. guish of his mind until they have been in 1 a  like situation. At last, through Prayer, the tide was turned. Material, custom-everything was plentiful: he worked hard and gained on the world. With his success came a  difficulty: his work, though plentiful, came irregularly; sometimes several customers .would want their work finished by a certain time. He would promise it by the time that he calcu- lated he could have it done, but in order to disappoint none, he had to overtax his ener- gies. Sometimes he could not accommodate all just at the time they wished, and they would say it was because he was doing well, and did not appreciate their patronage. Then, sometimes, a   particular friend would come in with a minute job, that must be done just now: if he did it, he insulted one friend; ifLnot, he insulted another. Sone men can only see their own side of the ques tion. Time rolled on; his energies were overtaxed; some faculties were wearing out, others rusting out for want of time to exer. cise them. 'He knew his health was failing; if he could only have a little time for recrea- tion, he could develop his faculties alike; but " all that a man hath will he give for his life." If he does this, he insults so many of his customers that he is turned back to his former perplexity. This evil is not caused by any plan of Providene4. A    day's work ought to have been sufficient for all purposes, after he had allowed a   reasonable time for recreation and     meditation. But the grasping disposition of those who are able to over-reach, has worked itself into all circles of society, through a false reasoning-that, as others over-reach me, I must do the same when I get a chance. This rule has narrowed down the weak to a very small border; so that it is with them a struggle between life and death, and tlicy have to humor unreasonable requests of customers for fear of loss. The world is made up of contending forces. It is divided into religious denominations trying to root each other out; kings, striving for power; political parties doing the same. Each organization is sub-divided again and again, until every man's hand is against his fellow. This is selfishness. The contrary principle, Love, is broad in its application, and tries to do good to all, and binds all its votaries in one organization that will swallow up the rest. I remember another man, who had a large family; he tried many ways to support them, had passed up and down in the world, his heart weigheddown with care. Many times he had met with scornful faces, or heard the  ringing laugh as he went on his way. He was an HONEST man; he trusted in the great i Provider to supply his wants. "How dis- ] agreeable," said a young dandy once, in his X presence, "( it must be to stand the heat, and 1 work in it I and how I would hate to have ] my face and hands so brown, and wear such  rough clothes I it would not suit me: but I 1 suppose they like it well enough; there are e people for everything." His was a narrow s mind compared with another, who said he s considered the honest laborer a hero, because s he battled with the difficulties that must be o overcome for the benefit of the world at large. t The scoffs and frowns of the shallow s hearted, peirce like arrows for a moment, but e many have spoken to my friend in a haughty s tone, whom he has now forgotten; and he h goes on laboring, and praying to the One o above.  I remembered another man who hadu spoken to me as follows:--"The tradesman may labor long, and meet with losses to bal- s1 ance his gains, and it is hard to bear; a A mechanic may have almnost finished some h stupendous work, as a house, a ship, a bridge u g-just as it comes to destruction. So with sc any other'ambition: but ail this is onlya pa drop to the woe felt in the parent's heart al when the child is 'going in the wrong road.' He sees in the misty future many snares, th many pitfalls, for the destruction of his be- hi loved child. In that child is centered his th hope, his ambition, his happiness. You a know what betel my son. I am a withered pi tree: no hope--no interest, in the future of ni this world I I labor on, but it is only to forget ag my sorrow. Every time I see a youth, I can th but say,-                s ' Thou child of prayer and blessing, h Would that my soul oould know   a What the unending future holds  su wot the, of jog, or woe' "    we   )f  There are many disagreeable works to ,d perform, and no hero will shrink from doing  a his part; but there are thousands whose ih whole talent is occupied ,in devising plans to e. shirk their part, in such a way as to give it a the appearance of taking a more honorable a part: this makes it very oppressive to the y remainder. Putting a higher price on any f commodity than it is really worth is one way, and there are many pretences under ?. whlch unprincipled men wrong their fellows. s, If all would do their part, it would be just g enough to ennoble the man,-to develop his B. faculties in proportion. d  Those who produce the good things of s life by their continual effort are certainly y the most honorable, but it appears as if the i, man who refuses to pay his debts, and puts 3 the money at interest, is the one who gets v the honor, and the benefit of the labor. While the musquitoes draw blood so plentifully, e the man will be weak. But in the midst of all our misfortunes, s there are many things to make us forget ? them. My mind is carried back to a lovely spring morning when I was a boy. It was s mine then to enjoy, and it is mine now. Such memories sweeten the cup of age. I loved the softness of the spring morning; and the boys sometimes went down to the brook, or to the mill-pond, ducking and fishing. In imagination I again enjoy the morning walk. We are at the pond. It is not yet light enough to observe many objects, but each one creeps slowly toward his! favorite spot for getting close to the game. For a while all is quiet, but as it gets lighter, nature shows more signs of life. The wild shriek of the water-bird breaks on the stillness of the morning. He flies here and there screaming and searching for his prey. Pres ently, he darts down to the surface, makes a splash, and rises up in the air a successful hunter. As he flies toward his nest, others of his kind take courage, and continue flying around, screaming, darting down, and rising Tuhe man who attends the saw mill is now stirring; he is preparing for his day's work. At the distant end of the pond, we can hear him passing the file over the saw,--" screech up I screech-up  screech-up! scrape. scrape 1" it sounds, the whole length of the pond, and awakens echoes in the woods around. 'The game is approaching us close along the shore. Keep quiet I and we will soon have a good shot. There they are I now is the time I "bang I bang I bang "Up rises a great flock, but there are some left flap- ping. In jump the dogs, and bring us out a nice pile of ducks. Let us try luck again: agreed I we move around to another part of the pond, and wait again. The sun is in the sky: the birds are building their nests, and singing theirlively songs. The minnows have come up into a little rivulet to take the sun. As we watch, the minutes fly away: we continue to watch; the minutes roll into   hours. There comes a flock of wild geese. Their path is straight and high in the air. Before it is noon they will fly many miles. They pass over us with scorn: they neither know nor care for the fact that these bushes hide the gunners. 'They look down on broad fields, landscapes, and winding rivers. They are free as the air that bears them. Look down into the edge of the water. There is a turtle; who will catch him? it is mnuddy bottom; there! he is gone! no dif- ference, he was small. There is a slight breeze, and the ripples on, the water reflect the sun; there is only, here and there an odd bird over the water, bult the saw-mill is at work in good earnest  the big wheel is going steadily over and over, and the heavy machinery of the grist-mill joins the music. The day wears away,--let us go. e will take the path that goes along by the side of the brook, until we come out to the open field; and along the edge of the woods we will walk slowly, and watch for flowers. My comrades laugh, and ask me ' what does a sportsman want with flowers?" to which I reply, "I will pluck tlhom, and be home as soon as you," we I8     ac across the field. Next we come to a fence, and tu'il ,o go down it: there grow briers and bushhs. and flowers all intermixed. Thlle tender lcaves are just peeping out, and the flowerls are only buds of promise--like the boys. We soon  come to the public road, where eaclh takes his own way.  Yes, there is joy amid solrrow. and there  is hope. Man is a worm, but help is ex- i tended, and it is only left for each individual ' to be submissive to God's will, and stand firn 1 when the waves dash against him, and he will 1 fnd himself fixed deeper and dleeper in the t] Rock of Ages. The scattered individuals, here I and thllere, who are planted firmly, are the a pillars for others to hold by, until themsolves are planted. How many have strengthened L themselves by the examples of the good men- h of old! and even of later times! The more a that become planted, all being braced as one, f the stronger they become, until the waves w cease to move them. T"he Great Tribulation, tl a an earthquake, causing' a mighty over- te soiing sea, cannot move them, nor loosen a en single pillar. I will now repeat one of my so ormlns of devotion, and go to my rest, an in epare for to-morrow's labor.       ui "Earth is a howling wilderness,     to No travelled road-no pointed way,   in There thousands wander in distress,   bu ' We all like sheep have gone astray.' sid ' Sometimes a few will build a tent, And live from what the soil affords- Compared with what they underwent,    P This makes them feel like mighty lords t10 lar * But fast the meagre soil will lose   tel Its might of strength, they cannot stay, Ion This spot to yield, does now refuse,  pro And they're compelled to move away.   to   ese.  {I There came one tinme, a Mian of wealth air.   7Who pitied ill the sons of toil, les.

"And thus as wanderers come home, ol    The pow'r to help, the greater grows, e And thus we know, when ALL have come, The land will blossom like the rose.' ;e  Sometimes it seems as if it were impossible for a wretch like me to accomplish any good; o but again I take a different view and feel d encouraged. At different times in my life , I was placed in situations tlhat gave me in- y fluence,-especially at the town where Il suf. n feted my greatest trouble-the loss of my s fanmily. But in Wisdom I was remnoved. I say in w  isdowln, thoul I do not know why it e was done. It milght lave been because the field was too small. 'rThle storyr of my suf- I ferings will relch more hearts than I could lhave benefited as a member of society. Yet, sometimes I almost long for a nlace in the world, where I might see the fiuit of my efforts,- then I would be more encour aged: nevertheless I am resigned. It was not permitted me to visit the Holy Land, there to tread and kneel on spots  hallowed by the presence of Him, but if I am permitted to speak for Him, it will be far better. I klnow that I shall see Him when his feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives, and I shall be protec- ted by the strong Arm that destroys its enemies, and malkes nations tremble. His smile is enough for me now. I will labor oni in quiet, and try to become more and more united to Him. I have a lodge where no human is likely to penetrate, until my body is past suffer. ing: and I have made arrangement to be buried where those six graves lie side by side, and contain the dust of those for wlhom I still weep. Sometimes grief overcomes me, and I lay my body in the coffin that is prepared, and think the time of my disolu- tion is at hand, and I shall soon be in the land of spirits; but again returning energy tells me that I am for this world a little longer. What time I do live I want to im- prove every minute in trying to live closer to Him, and  in doing something that will     in some way benefit my fellow-men. I think much about eternity, and no one can tell the sublimity of the subject without the same devotion. My past sufferings were blessings in dis- guise. The most of my suffering now is from grief. Yet I live in faith that the time will come when I shall grieve no more. l'hough I look forward with anxiety, yet I do not wish to hasten the time. I am willing to wait till the discharge comes, and while I stay-fight on. I know that I shall not be tried above what I am able to bear; yet of myself I can do nothing but sin. My hope is in the suffering and death of Jesus- the Conqueror. I left one place unguarded; the foe at- tacked me there, and I fell a prey to sin and remorse. This is prophetic of what will come upon all who fail to guard every point. Jesus had made His cause one with that of man, and all I had to do was to say:-'i Lord, I desire to be one with Thee, I am Thine, take me just as I am, and do with me what seemeth good." He-took me with my guilt; He chastened me yet more, but I kissed the rod, and the pain of remorse was gone. Though I suffer still, it is barely what He permits. I have no fear that He will let me suffer more than what is for my good. I throw myself in his arms of Mercy, and believe that when His feet touch the Mount of )lives, and the earth is rent beneath Him,   and the sea rushes from  its place, and His enemies are destroyed. I shall be lodged in a safe place, where I can look down on the commotion without trembling. And this is prophetic of all who give themselves to Him. There is no name but JEsus; there is no way but the CRoss. Many subjects occupy my thoughts, but the one that is through all, and in all, and crowns all, is the Cross, the CRoss, the CROSS. By it I live now, and by it I must. live forever. It is the most wonderful sub. ject given for man's contemplation. It is-The place where extremes meet. The cross! the cross! oh, dreadful place! How Jesus felt as he drew near! The cross! the cross! oh, holy place, Where sinners lose their guilty fear I The cross! the cross! oh, rugged wood, On which the Saviour's flesh was torn I The cross! the cross! oh, honored wood, By which Jehovah's weight was bornet Oh, day of darkness day of gloom! The sun, abashed, conceals his face. But man escapes an awful doom: Sin loosens now his fond embrace. "My God! my God!" the Sufferer cries, "Why? why hast thou forsaken me?

A lady sends us the following:-- PHn ADELPHA, JuTne 25th, 1869. DEAR SIR :-When first informed of some remarkable cures by your medicine, I was reduced to a most deplorable condition of mind and body by the Dyspepsia. My mind had been so impaired that I regarded my best friends as my worst enemies. I was continually foreboding evil. My whole body was so numb, my blood in such an impoverished condition, and my entire system so prostrated, that my physicians gave me little encourage- meat of relief. It is now two months since I commenced the use of your Brazilian Balm of Life, and, as all my friends will testify, I am now in the eoJeyment of perfect health.    MARY L.
