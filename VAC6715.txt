                SCROLL AND LOCKET, BY JAMES WALTER ERVEY, M. D,.  THE MNDIANAPOLIS: 1858.       PREFACE.  THE AUTHOR has no apology to make for offering this vol- ume to the public. The incidents herein narrated are founded upon facts. The time devoted to its composition was made up of leisure hours snatched from the active duties of his profession. Read it, and your opinion shall be the tribunal before which its merits shall be decided.      THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. CHAPTER I. The City of New York, as a commercial mart, has but two rivals on the globe, and under the influence of our country's startling enterprise, before the close of the present century, the trade of the world will crown her its proud Metropolis. Whilst its markets dislay the fruits of every land and, clime, its busy harbor the jolors of every nation, and its arts and industry every product of ceaseless and untiring genius, its vast mixed and crowded population, furnish coloring for every shade of the human character, and a vivid illustration of every withering vice, and every expanding virtue. On a graceful eminence, commanding a beautiful view of this world-renowned city, and the blending waters that sparkle at its feet, stands a magnificent mansion, upon which has been exhausted the riches of Gothic architecture. There, amid the dazzling splen- dor of wealth, and the welcome, warm and heartfelt smiles of loving friends, once lived the happy family of Charles Lovel. But alas! how quickly fortune, happiness, and fame vanish before the varying changes of this sin-deluded world. That happy family is scattered and gone. Intemperance, that dark stream whose waters have hurried millions on to deep and hopeless ruin, have borne them away, and they are happy no more. Charles Lovel struggled long and hard against the sweeping current, but he was out in its swift channel, and its resistless power mocked his unavailing efforts. He resolved, at last, to quit the city, forsake his old haunts, and exchange the tempt- ing circle for a quiet retreat. He bid his splendid mansion     6        THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. farewell, and turned his face towards the wilderness of the West, and soon found himself surrounded by the tranquil scenes of a western country seat, where, for awhile, he lived sober and happy, and the blossoms of hope sprung up- in the bosom of his family. But that tempter whose insidious wilds baffle our strongest resolutions, again presented itself before him; again he yielded to its power, and again the poison flood boiled, in maddening eddies, around him. The history of a fw short years recounts the sad tale; that his property is Equandered, that his little Willie has been frozen to death in the street, that his wife is broken hearted, and that his accom- plished Laura is a hopeless maniac. Mr. Lovel again returned to the city, but not to the scenes of his former splendor, but to a comfortless hovel on a gloomy alley. There his little James, ragged and cold, cried for bread, and there his poor wife died, as each day brought its torture to her disconsolate heart; there, too, each day, came sweet Alice, bringing to her mother such comforts as her scanty means would afford. It was not strange that every eye was eager to catch a glimse of her graceful young form, as, with quick, light step, she bounded by. It is no wonder that lovers came to worship at her feet, for upon Alice Lovel none could look and not love. Her face was, at once, a world of ravishing beauty, and in her deep blue, love-kindling eyes seemed to slumber dreams of rapture, though deep from her heart seemed to be, incessantly, rising sad and sorrowing memories. "Come earlier to-morrow evening," said Mrs. Lovel to Alice, "I wish to talk to you of matters to which I have never referred since I stood by your father at the altar." Next day was a gloomy day to Alice. Dark clouds and hovering storms seemed to lower upon her path. She was puzzled to imagine what her poor mother had to communicate. \ Often through the day, as her fingers glided over the notes of some sweet song of other days, tears would irresistibly start from her eyes. Alice's lesson that day to her music class was unusually short.   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.        7 "I have hurried through," she said, "for the purpose of spending part of the afternoon with my afflicted mother; but if any of you have a Favorite piece I will play it for your amusement before we part, and to-morrow I hope to feel bet- ter, and by increased application and attention, fully repay you for this apparent neglect." "I do not wish to detain you a moment, Miss Alice," said a sweet voice, "but here is a new song that I purchased this morning, and I would be happy to have you sing it." Alice seated herself at the piano, and run over the tune, and its mournful and blending chords seemed to awaken, in her heart, again, childhood's happy dreams, and strew the faded leaves, and withered flowers of her young life around her. When she had got through the first verse of that beautiful song:- "O leave me to my sorrow, My heart is oppressed to-day; O, leave me! and to-morrow Dark clouds may have passed away. There's a time when all that grieves me Wears a darker and deeper gloom- There's a time when hope deceives me, And I dream of bright days to come." Her eyes were again suffused with tears, and her bosom was heaving with emotion, mingled with the sorrows of the past, and the hopes of the future. "Oh!" said Alice,as she was on the way to the gloomy abode of her mother, "how the sentiments of that song went home to my feelings. 'Oh! yes, 'There's a time when all that grieves me Wears a darker and deeper gloom; There's a time when hope deceives me, And I dream of brighter days to come.' I would have given much to have been left alone to-day, for my heart has been overburdened and oppressed, and when I passed by the dear old home of my childhood, the panorama of our march down misfortune's way moved vividly before me." Alice found her mother weeping and much exhausted.     8        THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. "Oh! Alice," she said, "how lonesome I have been to-day; your poor father has not been here since yesterday. The other morning he was sober, for the first time for many long  days. He wept as none but the ruined could weep, when remorse. and anguish rankle in the soul. 'Could I call the treasures of the world my own,' he said, 'I would freely give them all if the last drop of the cursed poison was buried in the ocean's deepest cave. Whilst its temptations are around me, I have no hope-I am resistless appetite's unwilling victim, and I hope how soon my burning thirst and feverish lips will be cooled by the chilling touch of death.' He seemed to be at a loss for words to express his wretchedness. Oh! Alice, could I have you all the time with me, the hours would not seem so dreary. When you are gone God is'my onTy"om- panion, and swiftly I am hastening on to rest in his bosom." "Here mother," said Alice, "I will leave you this locket which contains my picture; it was presented to me by my class, as a token of their regard." "This is your perfect image," said Mrs. Lovel, "and it will be company for me when you are gone; but why do you look so sad, this evening, my sweet girl?" "This has been to me a dark day," said Alice, "my mind has been unusually disturbed. In addition to the thousand home troubles that burden my heart, others have arisen to trespass upon my feelings. For the last three months a strange and mysterious looking person has intruded himself upon my notice, and haunted me with his presence, whenever I have been on the streets, and seems ever to have his eyes upon me. Sometimes he passes me at a cross street, some- times he walks opposite me on the other side, and sometimes at a distance in front, or behind me. He is tall, and some would call him handsome, but to me he has a forbidding, downcast look, and the worst of all he wears the marks of dis- sipation, and I wish that I would see him no more. To in- crease my perplexity I have received sundry singular letters. Here is one of them.   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.        9 'New York, February the 6th, 1839. 'Miss ALICE LOVEL:--I hope your kindness will pardon the liberty that I assume iri addressing you this brief note. To you I am a stranger. I have seen your face, and heard your name-since I first saw you, I have only been happy when I could steal a glimpse at you on the street. With regard to my family and fortune, I can give you the very best references. Be assured that upon your willingness to accept my acquain- , tance depends my earthly happiness, and believe me,  Yours, &c.,    OLIVER BROOKS.' "To this letter, I have long since replied, that I must be excused from accepting his acquaintance, except it be within the circle of my old acquaintance and long tried friends, and, that I hoped he would cease to annoy me with his singular conduct-that the matter must here rest forever. Still his eccentric habits are unchanged. Still he pains me with his presence." "I am alarmed at this strange behavior," said Mrs. Lovel, "but let me entreat you, dear Alice, to beware, in God's name beware of him who tampers with the bowl. The sad expe- rience of your own unhappy father shows how awful the dan- ger; and how deep the ruin to which it tends. When he wras a young man he only drank wine occasionally, then he drank it more frequently, then he craved stronger drink, then he was ruined. I was well warned, too, of the probable result of his habits, and this brings me to the subject, to which I referred on last evening. "Your grandfather was a pious minister and a profound judge of human nature.' He descended from wealthy and distin- guished Scotch ancestry, and he was the lawful heir of a splen- did fortune, after the death of his father. The Lovel family was one of the best and wealthiest families in the old State of South Carolina. My mother was dead, and I was young when I formed the acquaintance of Charles Lovel-my father entreated me not to cultivate it, and it seemed almost to break his heart that I did not heed his advice. - He read in your     10       THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. father's early habits his future destiny, and faithfully warned me of that which I have so sorrowfully realized. One calm and beautiful moonlight Sabbath evening, the family had all gone to worship, and I was alone. I felt unusually solemn and reflective. I strolled out to take a walk among the shrub- bery, clinging vines, and sweet flowers that clustered around our lovely home, and to gaze upon the sweet stars. My father had been unwell for some days, and his strength seemed to be failing. On my return I heard him engaged in prayer to God for my earthly and eternal happiness; I shall never forget that prayer, it sunk deep into my heart, and that prayer ever ringing in my ears, turned my heart to God, in whose name I can rejoice, in this gloomy abode, reduced to the most abject poverty, and through whom I hope to meet my father and sainted mother in the rapturous world of bliss. But to my father's warning apprehensions I then turned a deaf ear, my love for Charles Lovel was as quenchless as the fires of heaven. He and I were inseparable-I love him yet, and would fain take him in my bosom to the better land. When my, father found that I was unchanging in my purpose, he took me by the hand and said, 'My daughter, you are my only child, and all the relative that I have this side of the deep ocean, and although you have determined to act contrary to my wishes, yet I shall ever love you. When you are gone I shall be left alone; should my health improve, I will again cross the waters once more to look upon the home of my childhood, and per- haps there to lie down in the quiet sleep of the grave.' He then handed me a Sealed Scroll, and said, 'this contains a copy of my last will, together with all the necessary explanation and instruction relative to the manner in which I wish my estate disposed of, when I am no more. If my predictions are false with reference to Charles Lovel, you will never need it, and if they are true, he shall never have it to recklessly squan- der. To this I am not determined by any ill-will toward Mr. Lovel, but under my present apprehensions, I am prompted to this course, by an honest conviction of right. Should want ever come upon you, remember that it shall not be because a   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.       " father did not love you, but because your husband has become an inebriate. Whilst I live I shall cease not to pray for you, and hope for the best; and since it has been part of the aim of my life to make you happy, since I have lavished upon you every tender affection, grant me this' last request: That you will put your trust in God, and that you will preserve the seal of this scroll unbroken whilst Charles Lovel remains your hus- band.' The day after I was married we started for this city as our future home, and my father set sail for Scotland, and I have never seen his face or heard a word from him since. I have kept my last promise, and the scroll with the seal unbro- ken is deposited in a secret apartment, in the bottom of that old trunk. When I am no more you may unseal it, and examine its contents; you will find, with it, some valuable papers, that I have made out and preserved, by which I think you will be able to recover some of the property that has been wrested from us by fraud; though they will be of no value to you while your father is living. Alice, may God bless you! Be with me as often as possible." Alice was living under the protection of the Rev. Mr. Wil- cox, a highly respectable clergyman, who, in consequence of ill-health, had retired from the active duties of the ministry. Mr. Wilcox was poor in this world's goods, but rich in the imperishable treasures of grace and godliness. He was belov- ed by all. His heart was open to every appeal of misery and want, and when he had to give none ever appealed in vain. Mrs. Lpvel's father was his father in the gospel, for it was under his ministration that he was convicted of sin, and induc- ed to seek the Saviour. It was under his patronage and. instruction that he had risen to,usefulness, and it was by him that he had beee treated with a father's tender regard. It was not strange, therefore, that Alice found a welcome home under the,humble roof of Mr. Wilcox, The family of this pious man consisted of his wife and amiable daughter, Celestia, between whom and Alice there was a striking resemblance, and betwixt whom there existed a sister's affection. They were almost constant companions. One evening Celestia was absent, Alice     12       THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. ) was lost and lonely. It was a lovely evening-Alice looked out upon the deep blue ocean, over whose trackless way many a wanderer was hurrying home, and beneath whose waves millions were sleeping to await the resurrection call. She looked outupon the beautiful stars; they seemed like senti- nels upon the battlements of heaven, watching over the sleep- ing wofld. Alice walked out and seated herself in a delightful arbor, situated in the rear ground of the building, where, with Celestia, she had passed many- pleasant hours. Alice did not return. Search was made for her, and she was not to be found. A gate opening into a back alley which was guarded by a strong lock, was found open. Next day the following article appeared in the morning papers. "MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE! "Alice Level, an accomplished and beautiful girl, residing with the family of the Rev. Mr. Wilcox, mysteriously disap- peared on last evening, between the hours of seven and nine o' clock." The public mind was excited to the highest pitch. A reward was offered, and diligent search was instituted, but no word came of Alice; no key could unlock this occult phenomenon, and Alice was given up for lost. It would be sacrilege to attempt to describe the deep sorrow, and bitter anguish of the already grief-burdened heart of Mrs. Level, on receiving this intelligence. Life's last joy and hope had fled. The deep waves had rolled over her, and she struggled not to raise again; but hope, sweet messenger, returned to her lonely bosom, and whispered, thy Alice may yet live. She recalled to her mind the circumstances connected with their last inter- view-the disclosure that Alice had made to her in reference, to the singular personage, and strange letters. Six dreary months rolled away, and although little James had haunted the post-office with his ragged presence each day, yet no word came from the lost one. Another month of painful anxiety to Mrs. Level had about passed, when James came running with a letter. Mrs. Level seized it with a trembling hand, her eyes   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.       13 no sooner caught a glimpse of the backing than she knew it was not Alice's hand-writing. She involuntarily let the letter fall, and for a few moments was unconscious of the world and its troubles. When she revived, she again picked it up; it was mailed at Cincinnati, Ohio. From whom could it be? Was it the sad tale of her daughter's ruin? As she broke the seal / her life seemed to come and go, as her soul vibrated between hope and dispair. She opened it. It was from Alice. She thanked God and praised him with overflowing gratitude. She read. "Cincinnati, May the 20th, 1839. "I am safe! The past seems like a chaos of troubled dreams. I was on my knees in the arbor, in my evening devotions before Almighty God--I was seized, gagged, blindfolded, and carried through the alley, hurried into a closed carriage, and borne swiftly off. I struggled. I tried to call for help, but in vain; I prayed that I might die, but life's mysterious power held me fast. There seemed to be a female on each side of me-I became unconscious. I felt drops of cold water fall upon my face, and a smoothe, soft hand pass over it. Where I was, or what had happened, came not to my mind. Fright- ful phantoms, and fearful apprehensions' crowded upon me. Consciousness returned, and the dreadful reality was before me. I opened my eyes, but I was too much exhausted to speak; I was in a finely furnished apartment, lighted by a beautiful silver lamp. I could see the glimpse of twilight through the large windows. A middle-aged lady dressed in black, was watching over me, rubbing my hands with warm camphor. A gentleman glided noiselessly into the room, approached the bed, and put his finger upon my pulse. 'Poor girl, he whispered, 'she is rallying, life is coming back.' 'What a sweet face!' said the lady, 'how calm! she looks like some pure and spotless saint that has fallen to sleep in the arms of God.' 'Yes,' said the gentleman, 'if she lives I shall be repaid for having braved the danger of her rescue.' As soon as I regaihed the power of motion and utterance, I stretched out my hands and begged for help and mercy. A     "      THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. kind voice whispered, 'fear not, dear stranger, you are res- cued-friends are around you.' I begged for an explanation. She said, 'you are at the house of Dr. Wells, near thirty miles from the city. The Dcctor, who is my husband, was called, last night about ten o'clock, to see a man who was supposed to be dying. On his return a closed carriage drove hastily by him. A closed carriage at that season of the year, driving at such speed, at so late an hour, excited his suspicion. He fol- lowed it at distance that would enable him to watch its manoeuvres. The moon shone brightly, and he could plainly see a tall starchy looking gentleman, with a downcast look, sitting out with the driver. When they were driving around the side of a hill, two miles above this, from some unknown cause, one of the hind wheels came off and rolled some dis- tance down hill. The Doctor drove up to the carriage, and saw that you was blindfolded and supported upon your feet by two finely dressed ladies, and that one of them was holding a white handkerchief over your mouth, evidently for the purpose of gagging you, should you attempt to make a noise. He resolved to rescue you, or die in the attempt. The two men having gone down the hill for the wheel, he jumped from his buggy, tore you loose from the women's grasp, placed you in the buggy, and drove off at full speed, and had he not had a fleet horse, he would have been overtaken. You are a strangar to me, but I thank God that you are rescued.' "When I found that it was a reality, I was overpowered with joy. I was lost in thankfulness and praise. I shouted with a rapture never before mine. I praised God as I never before had praised him, reaching out my hand as the Doctor ap- proached me, I said God bless you, I owe you a life of grati- tude, but heaven alone can reward you. I then told all that I knew of what had happened, to which they listened with tearful eyes and breathless silence. I begged them to keep all a secret-"to never take me back to the city, but to let my name and memory die with the tale. of my mysterious disap- pearance. In a. few days I was able to be up, and I accepted an invitation to accompany the Doctor and his lady on a visit (.   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.       15 to Cincinnati. Through the kindness of the Doctor and his friends I have obtained a pleasant situation, but I shall not say where, for the reason that this letter might fall into other hands. ' The amount that you will find herein, I can easily spare. I shall write again soon and explain more. Grieve not for me, but believe me ever your loving ALICE.' Who, whose bosom has never glowed with a mother's undy- ing love, can imagine the joy that this letter brought to the sad heart of Mrs. Lovel? A heart around which so thickly hung affliction's veil. Who, but a mother, fromlwhom loved ones have been torn, slain and scattered upon the highways of the world, can imagine the pangs that were ever preying upon her feelings? Who, but a ship-wrecked wanderer, upon some lonesome island of the sea, can enter into the feelings of Alice, when the unmerited wrongs of the world clustered around her memory? Driven from her home like a young bird from its mother's nest, and like it to become a prey to the devouring vultures that throng upon the avenues of life. The scenes of her childhood, the companions of her youth, she bids a long farewell, and turns her steps to a stranger's door. Though Alice had no home, no father, no fortune, to surround her with its shiny retinue and dazzling splendor; yet she had a pure heart, warmed by God's inspiring love, a mind well refined, ever sparkling with the bright gems of beautiful thought, and a young fresh beauty before, which the world mustworship. Alice resolved to devote her life to usefulness, and live only to make the world better; more particularly to battle against that giant evil whose wasting touch had desolated her heart and home. She commenced teaching a class of young girls, in whose minds she poured that wholesome instruction, the mark of which was destined to be seen on the rising future. O, how heaven-tending this office! for to woman's hands is committed the guidance of our destiny-all of our future enkindling hopes are blasted without her smiles, and without her offices of kindness and love, man has no heart to toil upon life's rugged way. It is she that expands the budding thought      16      THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. of tender childhood, and the mother's smile first excites the little heart to rapture, and gives direction to all of our earlier energies. Woman's love is a prelibation of that exhaustless and undying love that swells the song of happy spirits in th world of light, and it expands the soul when other objecs cease to charm; with it no task seems too arduous, no toil too burdensome, but the most rugged difficulties become pleasing duties, the gloom fades from life's stormy way, and the lone- some world becomes a paradise. Go on, then, sweet Alice, scatter light upon the benighted path, and win votaries to temperance, to virtue, and to God; though on thy path thorns may grow, and clouds may lower, be faithful to thy mission, and God will give thee light. Alice continued teaching n different country towns in Wes- tern Ohio near eighteen months, and lived secluded as much as possible. She occasionally corresponded with her mother, and sent her a part of h1er earnings. After this she received no more letters from her mother. Alice mourned the loss of her dearest earthly friend, for she was confident that her poor mother was no more,- and the thought that she had died alone, without a friend to bury her, raise a stone at her head, or plant a rose upon her grave, gave her much affliction. The charge that her mother had commit- ted to her, at their last interview-the preservation of the sealed scroll--also troubled her mind. Her little brother she knew must be t1 -,wn upon the cold charities of the world, and of her unhappy father she dare not think, it might be that he was dying in some loathesome grog-shop, or he might be buried with beggars, outcasts, and the friendless, in some neglected spot, upon which her eyes would never rest. She wrote to Dr. Wells, to communicate to her all that he could learn of her family, in answer to which she received the intelligence, that her mother was no more, and that a strange gentleman had her decently interred; and also, had made provisions for her little brother.' Of her father nothing could be learned, but he supposed that he too was dead. "God bless the stranger!" said Alice, "I should love to   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.       17 know his name, so that I could reward him, should it ever come within my power. The world is not without hope whilst such men are to be found." Soon after Alice received this sad news she accepted an invitation to visit Indiana. Though her heart was burdened with sad recollections, yet she rejoiced that a friend had appeared at her mother's grave, and she hoped that she had entrusted to his keeping the sealed scroll. 2   . 1      O)HAPTEER II. The sun was marshaling his gorgeous rays upon the hill-top, and sweet birds were singing the laborer home, when Emma came bounding up the flowery way, leading to a beautiful woodland retreat, holding in her hand a bouquet of wild flowers. "Here, cousin Charles," she said, "are trophies wrested / from Nature's solitude. The ocean may hide its gems, but around me no flower shall blush unseen. I love to sport amidst the romantic beauties of the unfrequented wilds, and join the merry song of nature's choir. 0; yes! Charles, ^-  'I would be a butterfly, born in a bower, Rocked in a rose while the nightingale sings;" Yes, and 'I would kiss all the buds that are pretty and sweet.'" "I am happy, indeed, dear cousin"/ said Charles, "to meet you in this merry mood, under the exhilarating influence of your wild romp in the woods. You will please to accept of my thanks for your poetry and flowers. Allow me to assure you that I love flowers too, with all of nature's boundless variety of beauties; yet, Emma, we should not. be unmindful that many a frequented way is strewed with thorns and briers. The poet used a beautiful simile when he compared the human mind with its diversified and medley shades of thought, to the variegated hues of the countless flowers that bloom, and as there are many flowers that lose their sweetness in the untamed desert air, and many bright gems in the deep bosom of the   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.       19 ocean buried, so there are many bright minds upon which the light of science never falls, and many a noble heart that beats its life away beneath the deep-rolling waves of wrong and neglect." 'These things I doubt not, dear Charles," said Emma. "I know but little of the wide world, and the various phases of mankind; but you are a philosopher, and I am delighted that you have come to spend the summer with us, and I shall be happy to be enlightened by your wisdom." "The delight is mutual Emma," said Charles, "and I shall surely get the best of the bargain, for I need-the influence of' your merry presence, to restore me to healthy variety of thought." "Come Charles," said Emma, "the bell has rung, let us go up to tea," and off she bounded, literally carrying her sedate cousin into the dining room; her ringlets floating in the breeze like the plumage of some merry bird. Her fingers acciden- tally caught a finely. wrought gold chain that was suspended upon Charles' neck, and drew from an inside pocket in his vest a plain gold locket, in which was set a rare and beautiful picture. "Well, Charles," she said, stopping to gaze upon it, "this is a sweet girl, don't keep me in suspense, but tell me who it is; I suppose, however, it is to be Mrs. Worthington." Charles, considerably embarrassed, remarked, "that he had never seen the person, but at some future day he would tell her how he came to possess the picture." Now, while our friends are taking tea, we will make a brief explanation. Our scene opens at a delightful chateau, near the county seat of one of the western counties of New York, near twenty years ago. Emma Clinton was the only child of a wealthy land-trader, a distant relative, of the distinguished De Witt Clinton. She was a laughing-young-girl of seventeen merry summers, small but beautifully proportioned; her rich brown hair fell in pend- ent, mischievous curls around her snowy neck; her pretty blue eyes, sprightly little feet, sweet, warbling songs, and     20       THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. innocent mirth, made up a world of amusement and delight. Emma Clinton had none of that sickly affectation of manners which we too often meet with in the beaz monde; but she moved with that untrammeled gracefulness which gives beauty its native charms, and the female form its inherent attractions. Charles Worthington descended from one of the eldest and best families in Ohio, and although he was not what the fasti- dious would call handsome, yet his appearance was at once prepossessing. His high-arching brow was the home of a mighty intellect, and his large, warm heart was the cherished abode of every generous impulse. Charles was a sober, reflecting philosopher; betwixt him and his cousin Emma there was a striking contrast. Charles was like the silent, unruffled deep, and Emma like the jocund little mountain stream, that comes laughing and skipping down fArm the green hills. Charles had just returned from the city of New York, where he had been to spend the winter and spring, preparatory to entering upon his profession as M. D. After supper Charles and Mr. Clinton took seats in the parlor, and Mrs. Clinton had just enterered, when Emma came to the door and admonished them to fly from that sultry room, and come up and breathe the fresh air. The party rose and were soon seated on the veranda. "Thank you, Emma," said Charles, "for this suggestion; this is truly a happy exchange, and for me a very salutary regimen, that balmy air as it comes rustling through the leaves and flowers, is freighted with vivifying life, and it is exercise in the open air that places the rose-kiss of health upon your cheek." "Do you not think," remarked Mrs. Clinton, "that too much exercise in the open air developes a masculine confor- mation." "Not in the least, dear aunt," said Charles, "exercise expands the lungs to the reception of air; this imparts a life- sustaining ingredient to the blood; the heart, quickened by its impulse, sends its red current flying along the arteries, to nourish and invigorate every vital function."   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.        21 "Enough of your physiology and technology," said Mr.  Clinton, and turning to an Irish lad who was seated by the door, continued, "Tom, can't you produce us some good wine for this occasion." "At your sarvice," responded Tom, and in a few minutes the ruby fluid was sparkling in half a dozen glasses upon a silver waiter. "There," said Mr. Clinton, "you needn't offer any to Mrs. Clinton or Emma, they are teetotellers, and had they not inherited good constitutions, would both have been dead long a'go. Take some, Charles, dismiss your high wrought theories about air, blood, exercise, and vital functions; there is some- thing that is substantial, that will warm up your frozen stomns ach, quicken and enliven your torpid energies, and plant roses upon your sallow cheeks." "Whilst I acknowledge a due appreciation of your kindness, dear uncle, I shall have to ask you to excuse me, I do not drink wine, nor can I accede to your philosophy. It is true that spirituous liquor stimulates the heart and arteries, but it contains no nourishment, and therefore, cannot add one parti- cle of strength to perpetuate the increased action that it produces; then 'the only rational conclusion at which we can arrive is, that this increased action consumes the vital powers, and leaves the system debilitated instead of invigorated." "Your reasoning is rather too much for me, Charles," said Mr. Clinton, "but experience, that better teacher, has demon- strated the fact, that it is congenial to me, at least," and down he quaffed the rosy beverage. "Charles, listen at Tom Moore, 'Oh! when I drink, true joy is mine, There's bliss in every drop of wine. All other blessings I have known, I scarcely dared to call my own; But this the fates can ne'er destroy, Till death o'ershadows all my joy.'" "Well, father," said Emma, "that was a horrid idea of old Tom Moore's, and is now obsolete and buried with the rest of those old sophistical dogmas, that have retarded the progress of civilization for the last half century. Why, there is more     22       THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. poetry in one pure sparkling rill of water, as it comes gur- gling from the rock, than in all the phantomed imagery of wine." "Well," said Mr. Clinton, "Emma, you can represent the Hydropathic wing of the medical profession about as well as Charles can the Alopathic. I suppose, however, if you were to prescribe wine, you would both turn Homeopathists, and give it in infinitesimal doses." "I have been attentively listening to your discussion," said Mrs. Clinton, "and I cannot suffer the opportunity to pass, without expressing an opinion. I deprecate the use of wine, from an observance of the fact, that its use creates an appe- tite for stronger drink, and that leads to drunkenness. It is the first link in the chain; it is the first scene in the drama of the darkest tragedy on the stage of human life." "There, Mrs. Clinton," said Mr. Clinton, "you have given the subject pathos, and capped the climax, yet what you have stated is incontrovertible; but all rules have exceptions, and I am unchanged in my opinion. I am already crushed beneath the accumulating force of your arguments; you will, therefore, excuse me for the present, and allow me further time for consid- eration, and as it is about my bed-time, I believe I shall retire." The rest of the company remained in conversation till near eleven o'clock. They rose to leave, when they heard the clear, sweet notes of a female voice, in the direction of a pretty mound, that rose upon the bank of a merry little stream that came bounding down from the hills. "Hush!" said Emma, "the wild Maniac sings;" and each ear was strained to catch the words, as they floated out upon the midnight breeze, in wild and rapturous melody. The last verse Charles recognized as part of one of Campbell's poems. "Why does the brother of my childhood seem Restored awhile, in every pleasing dream. Why do I joy the lonely spot to view, By artless friendship blessed when life was new." "Oh!" said Emma, "what a lovely voice, and yet how sad and mournful; there is some mysterious magic in its enchant-   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.       23 ing cadence, that, to my fancy, resembles angels singing a troubled spirit home to rest, and as the faint echo whispers it back, it reminds me of the first whisper of that spirit, when the light of immortality breaks upon it." "Pray tell me," said Charles, "who is this enchanting night warbler." "I cannot," said Emma, "she is called the Maniac of the Mound. She has sung at that mound once or twice a year for the last three or four years.- The gossips have many stories afloat concerning this romantic incident, a majority of whom agree in declaring the place haunted, and that the sweet singer is the young love of some hero, whose bones sleep beneath the mound. There, Charles, is a ghost story for you, when you retire you can dream of fairies, and visit the airy empire of imagination." Here the party said good night; but Charles could find no sleep; that voice haunted his pillow, and ceased not to sing. Visions of bewildering beauty floated in his mind, his soul seemed bathed in some mysterious enchantment, and like Virgil's imaginary tree, "Full of visionary leaves, and on every leaf a dreamn." At last sleep, "The death of each day's life," came and wrapped him in its oblivious mantle. Next morning the mysterious singer furnished a theme for conversation at the breakfast table. "Not far from that mound," said Mrs. Clinton, "is a little grave, upon which some attention has been recently bestowed, and for which no one seems able to account." "Yes," said Emma, "I visited it not many days since, and there is a beautiful whie marble monument erected upon it, on which is carved a/opening rose bud, and a demoniac form who seems to be pouring a glass of burning fluid upon it, and so well is it executed that I could almost see the bud wither  beneath its touch-beneath which is the following inscription: "et heaven's dew expand the bud, The suh itgenial warmth impart- O! blight not with the poison flood, The buds that blossom in the heart."'     24       THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. "With this little grave,' said Mrs. Clinton, "there are con- nected some highly interesting, though deeply afflicting inci- dents. About fifteen years ago a wealthy and intelligent family moved to this place from the city of New York. The gentleman soon took to drinking, and although he had pur- chased largely of valuable real estate, he soon squandered and ran through with it all. He had a sweet little, bright-eyed* boy, Willie, who, contrary to his mother's wishes, and in despite of her entreaties, the father would take with him to the tavern; where he would spend the day, and often part of the night in the most reckless debauch. He would sometimes become so much intoxicated that he could not get home, and would lie in the street till morning; at which time Willie would cry himself to sleep by his father's side, and next morning he would be found with his arms around his father's neck. - This gave his mother many sleepless nights; after the nights became cold, she would hunt them upon the streets, at late hours in the night. This, with its consequent affliction, underminded her health, and she soon proved to be unable for the task. One cold night in December she waited their return till near midnight. She could stand it no longer; she started in pursuit; they were at the tavern, and the father too much intoxicated to walk. She took her Willie in her arms, and with tears streaming down her pale cheek, besought the land- lord not to let her husband have any more intoxicating drink. At which he became very indignant, and swore that 'he thank- ed no woman to interfere with his legitimate pursuits, and that he would let her husband have drink whenever he pleased.' He taunted her by offering her a glass of brandy. "The mother managed to keep Willie at home a few weeks. She at length took very sick; the father again stole Willie from her, and again carried him to the tavern; a while before midnight he started home, and at that time could have walked home. He took Willie, who was then asleep, in his arms and started; the landlord called him back and said, 'it is my treat; and as you have some distance to go with Willie, he would be better to have something to warm him up-here, give him this   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.       25 sweetened dram-wake up, W4lie, and drink that, it will keep you warm.' They did not get half way home; the father became unable to carry Willie, and fell with him upon the ground. Willie finding that he could n6t walk, crawled toward home, till he was overpowered by the stupifying drink, and the benumbing cold. He crept between two houses, and there froze to death. This is his grave." "Rum!" said Charles, rising from the table, excited, "rum is an indiscriminate destroyer of the human family, even sweet and smiling childhood escapes not its unsparing ravages. He who peddles it out to its hungry victims, shuts from his soul the smiles of God, tempers his heart with the adamant, arms himself with the weapons of hell, and marches through blood and tears, to the sound of the groans, sighs, and lamentations of the wretched. That rum-seller was a murderer as dark as the midnight assassin, who grapples for your vitals on the dark highway. Men are imprisoned for breaking your lock, or picking your pocket; but for a few dollars they can procure license to pick the pocket, murder the body, and damn the  soul. That little boy was stolen from his mother's arms and murdered in the highway-the murderer was licensed. Our Constitution and our Statute law are mockeries, and democracy, and all the high-sounding names by which parties are designa- ted, are nothing but disgusting, insignificant cant!" After breakfast Charles and Emma strolled out among the hills. After the satchel was filled with wild flowers, and they had sipped from all of the cooling springs, they turned their steps toward the little mound, and were soon seated upon its grassy carpet. "Here," said Emma, "I have whiled away many pleasant hours, and-here too, Charles, I have some sad misgivings, as I look out upon the future. You may think, dear cousin, that because I am merry and gay, that my bosom is a stranger to grief." "So had I thought, Emma," said Charles. "I had thought tBa-ene as good and as innocent as yourself, could be happy in the consciousness of her own spotless purity.' 4             - }      26       THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. "Do you not recollect;-Charles," said Emma, "the incident of the sweet little babe that smiled and waved its tiny hand, as the eagle was bearing it off, as its prey to the mountain rock, and this brings my mind to the explanation that I intended to give; I fear that my merry, thoughtless life, almost unclouded by sorrow, hitherto, might be exchanged for dark and fathomless affliction." "I hope, Emma," said Charles, "that your fears are ungrounded, and I see no cause for such sad apprehensions," "You don't know all," said Emma.  "It was upon this mound that I pledged my love to Walter Emet-I can never love another; for him my love is as pure as heaven, and as deep as eternity, and yet I have not told you all; Walter Emet loves the bowl, and has been known to be intoxicated, but for the last two years he has been strictly temperate, and is an uncompromising advocate of the temperance cause. My attention has been recently, so forcibly drawn to the ruins of intemperance, that I tremble for the future, when I look out upon the temptations that will be thrown in his way. Now, Charles, since I have disclosed to you the secrets of my bosom, I hope you will not refuse to tell me who it is, whose picture you wear so close to your heart." "Promise me then," said Charles, "that the secret shall remain sacred and inviolate in your own breast, and there die, unless some circumstance in this changing world makes it your duty to reveal it; do you promise?" "I do," said Emma, "and call upon the pure spirit of the little sleeper in that narrow bed, (pointing to the little grave,) to witness it in heaven." The silence was unbroken for some minutes. Charles rose to his feet, turned to Emma and said, "I have had the pleas- ure to associate with many ladies of virtue and refinement- many that the world called beautiful, yet I have never seen one to whom I could make that holy vow that was made upon this lovely mound. Here, Emma, strange as it may seem to you, is a picture that first taught me to love. The heart that warms these ruby lips is as pure as the dew that bathes the   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.       27 cheek of the mountain rose-I have never seen her, and per- haps my eyes will never behold her. The narrative connected with this locket is a sad tale of suffering and ruin, and equals the wildest romance that ever startled the votaries of fiction. "One gloomy night last winter, as I was returning from my dissecting room, about midnight, in the city of New York, I met a ragged little boy, crying from door to door. He told me that his mother was dying; I followed him through a dark and lonesome alley to a miserable hovel, in which there was neither fire to warm, nor light to cheer, and there I received from dying lips, the tale of a once Jlappy, but then blasted, heart-broken mother. As the door opened a faint voice from the corner of the room whispered, 'Who is it? I need not ask, none but the good would come to the house of the wretched.' The little boy was soon by his mother's side, crying with heart-breakingo anguish. I asked her if there was anything that I could do for her. 'Nothing,' she said, 'in an hour more I will be an inhabitant of eternity-the invisible world of spirits; though you are a stranger to me, yet I am glad that you have come to spend with me the last moments that I have to spend on earth. I am not afraid to die alone; but I have a favor to ask-may I trust a stranger?--will you be faithful to the trust of a dying mother?' I told her that she might trust, that I would be faithful. Then she gave a brief narra- tive of her sorrowing and eventful life. Once she had had wealth, smiling friends, and happy home; but now they were all gone. For ten long years had she been a drunkard's wife, and as the sad history of its wrongs crowded upon her mem- ory, she saw life's joys and hopes withered and strown along its way. She was the mother of four children. 'My little Willie,' she said, 'fills an unknown gra in a strange land, and soon I will join his happy spirit, and re-unite in heaven earth's broken ties. My Laura, affliction's dark cloud has shrouded her bright intellect, and she is a wanderer-where I know not. James,' addressing the little boy, 'I leave you homeless, ragged and cold, in the land of the destroyer. My husband will soon fall into that grave, over which hangs the     28       THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. gloom of eternal night. Oh! my Alice, will sorrows like mine ever befall thee? thou too, art a wanderer; sweet child, my eyes will never behold thee; no more will I tax thy scanty earnings, which, alone, for two long years has supported my wretched life. Unknown and unseen,' she said, addressing me, 'I prayed to God to send me one to whom I might trust the last office of kindness, to my dear Alice. Here is a Locket in which you will find her picture-perfect; and by it you will know her, should you ever meet her in the world's high- way. Here are some valuable papers,' handing me an ancient looking Scroll, carefully sealed, and a package of papers likewise secured by a seal, 'take them, stranger,' she said, holding out her cold and trembling hand, 'and promise a dying mother that you will protect this scroll and package, and guard the seals from being broken, until you seek out and present them to the person whose picture is contained in the Locket.' I Iromised her that I would leave nothing within my power undone to consummate her last wishes-her confided trust. 'James,' she said, 'come and kiss me; I have nothing to leave you but the wretched heritage of the world's cold charity. Stranger, wilt thou give bread to my starving boy?' I was too much affected to answer, but my heart responded yes. Here the poor woman struggled for breath; when she could again speak, she said, 'tell your father, should he ever return, that your wearied mother'has gone to rest-the light of earth is fading-stranger, may God bless you. Hail, bless- ed heaven! Earth, farewell!' "This scene is ever vivid upon my mind. I had the poor mother decently buried, and little James provided for. I shall never forget that solemn scene. James and I stood alone at the grave. Emma, I have tried to be a philosopher, and reconcile my feelings to the ways of the world; but here my heart turned back upon its wayward path, and I wept over the desolations of licensed iniquity. If that lovely girl lives on earth, I must see her, and although there is some deep mys- tery about this occurrence, yet I feel that my destiny will never be accomplished until it is unraveled; and I have vowed   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.       29 before God that I will fight the rum-traffic as long as he gives me power to- raise a hand, or lisp a word." "Amen!" said Emma, raising her blue eyes to heaven. "God bless you, Charles!" Then she took the picture, kissed it and said, "go, dear cousin upon thy mysterious errand; pay thy vows to the dying stranger; go seek sweet Alice, and if thou love her, as thy dreams have taught thee, take her to thy bosom."     C EAPTER III.. Near one year has passed since Alice Level first saw the town of F    , one of the most romantic villages in the West; around it bends, like a silver bow, one of the lovliest tributaries of the Miami; on each side of it rise gigantic hills, from whose basis gush fountains of ever-living water. Here Alice was soon surrounded by a circle of confiding friends, so pure were her motives, so pious and exemplary was her life, that she turned every heart to love; and every tongue to praise; but Alice was lonely and unhappy-pale grief and withering care were making their mark upon her cheek, and sorrow was furrowing its deep chasm in her heart. She but seldom smiled, but ever seemed to be calm and unruffled; and as the sunbeam reveals the sparkling treasure from which the clear-gliding stream has washed the drifted sand, so did the angelic brightness of her eye reveal a soul from which a Sa- viour's love had washed the dross of sin. From Sabbath school Alice never stayed; at church she was as punctual as the bell that tolled the hour, She watched by the couch of the afflicted, wiped the clammy sweat from the face of the dying, and soothed the mourner at the grave. Alice sought out the poor and destitute children of the village, and had them to attend Sabbath school; and shed moral and intellec- tual light on the entire circle of her acquaintance. It was not strange that Harry Wayland loved to hear Alice sing- "Our souls,1by love, together knit, Cemented, mixed in one."   I      THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.       31 Although Harry had never talked to Alice of love, yet it was evident that her presence made him happy. Alice, too, could read in his earnest look the language of his heart; for outward expressions reveal inward emotions. The wrongs of intemperance soon excited the attention of Alice. For many days she had noticed a pale and ragged little boy, with a sor- rowful, dejected countenance, come in from the country, and return with a jug, every day about the same time(. She had often sought an opportunity to speak to him, but he seemed to shun her. One day he came later than usual, and she dis- missed school before he returned. She noticed, as she turned from the school house, the scholars gathered in a group a short distance ahead of her. Bill Flint, the son of the rum- seller of the village, had followed the poor boy from the grog- shop, and had pulled off his hat, put mud in it, and was making fun of his ragged clothes. The boy was crying pitifully. Alice reproved Bill, and shamed him for his cruelty. She cleaned the boy's hat, placed it upon his head, and kindly asked him his name. "George Price," answered the boy, with suppressed grief. "Have you a father, George?" asked Alice. "Yes, ma'am," said George, with tears starting in his eyes. "Have you a mother, George?" "Yes, ma'am," answered George, the tears flowing more freely, and picking up his jug to start; "but poor mother is sick-father will whip me if I don't hurry with this whisky; I would as leave die as to go after more;" wiping the tears from his eyes. "Tell me where you live, George," said Alice, "and I will detain you no longer." "We did live at that big house by the mill, when father was sober, but now we live over the hill in the woodsy said George, still crying. "Don't cry," said Alice, as the weeping boy trudged up the hill. Alice wept as she beheld his slender form reeling beneath the weight of the jug. "Oh, rum!" said Alice, as she turned     32       THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. from the sickening sight, "an eternity of wrongs are thine! how dark and limitless the empire of thy ruin? How long, O, God! wilt thou permit its flood of anguish to drown the soul? O! my country, where is thy patriotism? Where sleeps the power that protects our altars and our homues? Who that has a heart would not, like Alice, have turned sick- ened from this dark picture of a Christian Government? Whose blood does, not rush to its deeper channels to behold childhood's young energies crushed beneath the iron heel of that monster who stalks unbidden through our land, under the sanction of our statutes? When Alice returned to her boarding house, which was that of a very worthy professor, she found a party awaiting her arrival, among whom was an aged and admiring friend, upon whose head the white frost of age had placed its snowy mantle, but who possessed one of those iron constitutions which never droop beneath the pressure of years, and in whose bosom blos- somed the ever-green hope of immortality. Mother Starkes was the adviser and beloved of all. "What makes you look so sad, this evening, dear child?" slhe said, as Alice entered the door. "Because humanity weeps around me," said Alice. "What fresh fountain of human grief has stirred the deep quiet of your feelings now, kind Alice?" asked the old lady. "That fountain which for long, long centuries has swept like the breath of a destroying pestilence over every land, and withered everything before it-the fountain of intemperance. I saw a poor boy spit upon and abused by the offspring of a rum-seller, who was stealing the bread from his mouth, the clothes from his back, and hope from his heart. Do these afflicting realities never rise before you?" "Yes, Alice," said the aged woman, "they spring up unbidden at every step, like troubled ghosts, and I am sad when memory whispers them back to my mind. Age as well as childhood bleeds beneath its scourge. Around the top of yonder cone-shaped hill leads a winding path to the remains of an old log hut; there many years ago lived a solitary old --- .-l   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.       83 man and his only child. The old man being a revolutionary soldier, he drew a pension, and managed to live upon it. Soon, however, the boy grew up and the old man became helpless. 'Six cents coming to you,' said the grocery keeper, as the boy stood by his counter, to purchase some cheese for his aged father; 'take something to drink, that will square us, I can't make the change.' From that start the boy became a drunkard, spent his father's pension, and left him alone to starve and freeze. The old man soon became a mere skeleton covered with filthy rags. It came to his ear that he was to be taken to the poor-house, the old man became distracted at the idea, and resolved to put an end to his life. 'He crawled into the woods in the middle of cold winter, and was there found dead, with his head upon a rock, and his sightless eyes turned toward heaven. I stood by his grave, Alice, and called on God to witness the visitations of this curse on helpless age. Oh! yes, dear Alice, I pray how soon this lamentable evil may be removed from our gospel-enlightened land." After the company dispersed, Alice was seated on the old fashioned back porch alone. As she looked out upon the rippling stream marching through the green banks towards its ocean home, it reminded her of how swiftly she was passing, on time's fleet pinions, from change to change; anl as she beheld the sun penciling his last lingering smile on the hill tops, it called to her mind the long shadows that fell upon her path, as the cloud of misfortune rose over the sun-shine of her childhood. The roar of the old mill-dam, mingled with the distant, clanging bells of the village herd, filled the air with a mysteriously lonesome sound. Everything combined to make Alice feel the loneliness of her situation. Thoughts of home rushed upon her mind. "Oh!" said Alice "'Am I not of those who wander, Unaffectioned here and there; But my heart must still be fonder Of my sites of joy or care."' Another perplexing question was before' her for her consid- eration. Should she encourage the love of Harry Wayland? 8     34       THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. Harry was dignified in his deportment, fascinating in conver- sation, and polished in his manners. Public opinion pro- nounced him chef d'ceuvre. He was the son of John Way- land, of Hampton, Virginia, and possessed a fine fortune. Harry was tall, straight, and square built, with piercing, black eyes, everjeted by a massy brow, swelling out its develop- ments to the infinite satisfaction of the most fastidious phre- nologist; over which was a crown of wavy, raven-black hair. Although Harry was not a professor, he seemed to be unex- ceptionable in his morals. Alice had a heart in which slumbered love's unbourded passion, for in the purest hearts dwell the deepest love; but that love had never been wakened in Alice, none had ever caught the whisper of its dreams; for conscious judgment guarded its repose. Although Alice was not capable of resisting its influence when fully aroused within her bosom, yet she possessed the ability to test the power to which it yielded. One bright and balmy Sabbath evening, Harry and Alice wandered down the banks of the stream, and were seated' upon a grassy nook. "How countless the beauties of smiling nature," said Harry. "How matchless the power that reared these giant hills, and rolls this stream on over its rocky bed," replied Alice. "Yes, Alice," said Harry, "you behold God i ryin everything, and in you I behold the perfection of His works, and why should I try to conceal that which you have already extorted from me, and that which the world is not too blind to see. Is it necessary, sweet Alice, for me to tell that I love you? The brightest earthly hope that lingers in myheart is of thee; shall this hope. still light for me a bright future, or shall it, like those lovely blossoms that spring up aro nd us, bloom only for a few short days, and then fade forever?" Whilst Harry was making this declaration, tears started down the cheeks of Alice. Then turning to Harry, she said, "Kind Harry, I am not so dead to tender emotions as to entirely disregard your affections, but I have uried so many   THE SCROLL AND, LOCKET.       35 objects of my love; so often have my hopes of earthly happi- ness been blasted; so dark have gathered the clouds over my early prospects, and the memory of departed joys cluster so thickly upon my mind, that I have not yet consented to form any ties that would turn my heart back to this ever-changing world. The future may determine me to decide in accordance with your wishes. Though I am young, Harry, yet many troubles are upon the record of my memory, and startling romance crowds upon my brief history-if your heart remain unchanged, at some future time, I will tell you all. Suppose, tind Harry, that bitter persecutions were to come upon, and te withering tongue of scandal assail me?" "I vow," said Harry, "that none of these could make me love thee less." "Suppose that ruffians were to seek me out for their prey, would you stand by, and defend my unprotected innocence?? "Yes, though all others forsake thee, and with my heart's blood," replied Harry, with a determined air. "Would my word be sufficient to refute that which others might say of me in the future?" said Alice. "I cannot think thee capable of falsehood," replied Harry. "Behold," said he, "dear Alice, how unchanging the seasons roll, how constantly the sun lights up the day, and how faithfully the moon watches over the night. I will be as faithful, constant, and as unchanging as these." "I may yet need a friend as faithful as you have vowed yourself to be, and such a friend I could never cease to love." Alice and Harry both returned happier than they went, and when they parted Harry kissed the sweet hand that he yet hoped to win. Soon after this an incident occurred, which brought down on Alice a flood of unmerited persecution. Through her persuasion a reckless young man had joined the temperance society. Imiediately after he put his name to the pledge his old comrades, beaded by .old Flint, the rum-seller, resolved to seduce him back to his old habits. They succeeded so far as     36       THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. to get him into the rum-shop, just at which time Alice passed along, the street-he happened to see her as she passed; at that moment all his resolution came back to him. Burning anger kindled in his eye-he flew from the door like a chafed lion, and as he lighted in the street he swore that the first man that ever asked him to drink a drop of the cursed poison, he would send him to eternity as quick as the lightning's flash. Then turning to Flint, he said, "you arch-fiend of hell, open your mouth and I will send daylight to your corrupt heart, that you may go to your father, the devil." No one spoke a word in reply, and he turned and walked directly off, and still lives in the enjoyment of that determination which the pre- sence of Alice prompted. From that time the enemies of the. temperance cause direct- ed their darts at Alice; for it was through her influence that the first temperance society was established in the village. It was soon whispered, in a certain circle, that Alice Lovel was a woman of bad repute, who had fled from the city of New York, and that she had come to a secluded village to keep firom being detected.. Her retired habits and her beauty were used against her. The scandalous report soon came to the ear of Harry Wayland, who traced it back to Flint, and he refused to correct it, and produced as proof a New York paper, in which was a notice of Alice's mysterious 'disappearance, and swore that he would have more proof in a few days. Harry turned pale as his eyes run over the notice, and he left without uttering a word in reply. Flint had noticed Alice and assiduously watched for an opportunity to blast her reputation, and ruin her influence, ever since she had taken'an active part in the temperance movement; and there are few men who can ruin character or blast reputation more completely and at shorter notice than a rum-seller. The evening on which Alice met George Price she happened to have on the same dress in which she was stolen from the city; in the pocket of which was one -of the letters that she had received from Brooks. In pulling out her hand- i   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.       37 kerchief to clean the poor boy's hat, she pulled the letter out with it. Bill Flint saw it fall, and when Alice was gone he went and picked it up, and carried it to his father, who imme- diately directed a letter of inquiry to Brooks. But before Brooks would reply to it he wrote to Alice the following letter: "New York, July the 1st, 1839. "ALICE LOVEL :-I need not tell you that your cruel beauty bewitched me, and like a spectre, I wandered through the streets to catch a glimpse at your face. You refused my acquaintance because my habits excluded me from the circle in which you moved. You treated me with the utmost con- tempt, and seemed to be heedless of the passion that was maddening my brain.  Still the flame abated not, and its impetuous fervor impelled me on. I sought you by force, and you was rescued; since which I have plunged deeper into dissipation to drown the otherwise unsufferable sorrow of my disappointment. Now you are within my power; if you will become mine, I will reform my habits, and devote my life and fortune to your happiness; if you will not, I will be as insidious in accomplishing your ruin as you have been to shun my presence, and slight my offers." Alice received this letter before she was aware of the scan- dalous report that was in circulation about her. She was alone in her room when she read it-for some minutes she sat motionless-the stream of life seemed to be. freezing in its fountain, and the thunder of destruction seemed to be aiming its bolts at her lonely heart. "Oh! God," she at length said, "let not the waters overflow me, neither let the great deep swallow me up." Then falling upon her knees, she prayed as none but the faithful could pray. The promises of God's protection came to her soul, and calm resignation sat upon her brow. Oh! how measureless the power of prayer. Without it man is utter weakness, and without redress to the throne of Omnip- otence. Prayer is, "The cure of all cares, the grand panacea     38    THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. for all pains, doubt's destroyer, ruin's remedy, the antidote to all anxieties." Alice could not imagine how Brooks had learned her local- ity, and she soon resolved to leave the place and baffle his pursuit. Next evening Alice was sitting alone brooding over her misfortunes. Looking up, she saw Wayland enter the door, pale and dejected; they soon passed a mutual exchange of sorrowful looks, and were seated together. "What, kind Harry," said Alice, "has ruffled the smooth tranquillity of your mind?" "Tell me first, Alice, what discord disturbs the harmony of your soul?" "Then promise me, before God and the throne of your honor, that what I tell you you will, for the present, disclose to none." "Should I ever betray your confidence, Alice," said Way- land, "be mute my tongue; my fancy paint no more; and dead to joy, forget my heart to beat." "Then," said Alice, "hear it all." Wayland sat motionless whilst, with tears, she recounted the startling incidents of her life. After which they wept together. Then Harry told her of the report that was in circulation; on hearing which, Alice's cheeks became color- less; her bossom heaved and her lips trembled. "Then," said she, "the last ray of earthly hope fades behind the gathering clouds. I have struggled long and hard against the winds of adversity, but it seems that I must, at last, yield to the power of the storm. Oh! how sweet it would be to die-to dissolve the power that binds this aching heart and throbbing brow to a desolate world-to shut my eyes upon its objects, and close my ears to its sounds."' Alice sunk back upon the settee; help was summoned, but it was some time before she could be resuscitated. When she could speak, she asked to be alone. The next day Wayland prosecuted Flint for slander, and soon the whole village was in a feud, some taking one side /   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.       39 and some the other. The trial was to come off at the Septem- ber term of the Circuit Court. Alice began to show marks of declining health. The rich lustre faded from her cheeks; soon she became unable to teach, and before September arrived, she remained the most 'of the time in her room. Brooks finding that Alice would not answer his letter, was satisfied that she would not comply with his wishes, and he proceeded forthwith to accomplish his vile purpose. Flint soon received from him the following answer to hs lete: "New York, August the 19th, 1839. C"N. P. FLINT-Sir:-Your letter of inquiry with reference to Alice Level is at hand, and after some delay occasioned by ill health, I hasten to communicate to you facts which may be of importance to you, and the people of your village. On the night of the 27th of August, 1838, by agreement, I met Alice Level at the back gate of the Rev. Mr. Wilcox's resi- dence in this city, and we eloped together. We were never married, nor did I live with her long before another man stole her from me, after night, and I have not seen her, or heard of her since, until I received your letter. All of this I will sub- stantiate by my solemn oath, if necessary. Yours, &c., OLIVER BROOKS." Old Flint showed this letter to his attorney and some of his confidential friends, and by some means it came to the public ear, and was talked of publicly in the streets; after which Alice's prospects grew darker each day-the clouds gathered thicker around her. Many began to think that they might be deceived, and began to apply to Alice the Italian proverb: "4To mavala por rosa mas devenia curdo,"-I took her for a rose, but she has proved a thorn. Oh! the cruel suspicion of the public untutored mind; how often does virtue and merit droop beneath its withering blight. there seemed to be reasons for believing the report. There was the New York paper with the notice of her disappearance,     40       THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. corresponding precisely with Brook's letter in every particu- lar. It was hard even for Alice's best friends to disbelieve such well-joined testimony. Eventually Alice learned the purport of this letter, and the report that it had occasioned. "I will prove it a falsehood," she said, as a spark of the latent energies of her soul flashed from her eye. Flint's 'attorney wrote to New York for the affidavit of Brooks, which was promptly forwarded in accordance with the above specification. There were but two persons living by whom Alice could rebut this testimony-they were Dr. Wells and lady. Mr. Wilcox was dead; Mrs. Wilcox and Celestia were gone, and she knew not where. She could think of none to whom she could appeal for help, but Dr. Wells. She wrote  him a letter and gave him a full statement of the facts as they were, in answer to which she received the following letter: "Clarksville, August the 18th, 1839. "Mss ALICE LOVEL:-Yours of the 6th is before me. It affects me much to hear that you are again in trouble, or  rather that you have never ceased to be troubled. I am sometimes ashamed to call man my brother. When I behold  him thirsting for the virtue, for the destruction, for the life of an unprotected girl. Stealing her from home, pursuing her as a fugitive, and persecuting her among strangers. But fear  not, Alice, I will again fly to your rescue-give yourself no uneasiness.               R. WELLS." This letter relieved Alice very much, and in part restored  confidence to her friends; but when it was known that Flint's attorney had received the affidavit of Brooks, again she was left with but few to vindicate her cause, and so dark did the  clouds seem to gather, that Wayland himself began to falter. Flint had written to Brooks to appear at Court in person, and was already exulting in the triumph of his cause. His grog-  shop was constantly thronged with low and filthy blackguards , i whose theme was Alice Level. There is no place on earth so  : much like hell as a rum-shop, with its foul fumes of whisky  and tobacco, its boisterous cursings, its unbridled profanity, ?t : * I ** -        oa   THE' SCROLL AND LOCKET.       41 licentious vulgarity, and its fiery eyes, bloated cheeks, aggering gaits, and stammering tongues. These vile haunts 'iniquity are a tarnish upon our country's escutcheon, a libel )on our institutions whereby the rights of man are protected, Id a disgrace to a Christian people. God send that we may on move from beneath the shades of the darker ages. No sooner did Alice discover that Wayland began to falter, an she became nerved with almost supernatural energies. ie seemed to scorn and defy her persecutors. Though Way- nd appeared to be devoted to her cause, yet she could read, any woman can, for vultus est index animi, "the counte- rnce is the index of the mind." She could discover that ere was a slight misgiving; under these circumstances she :eferred releasing him from her defense, and taking her cause to her own hands. This was an ordeal through which none it a firm heart and a true love could pass. Everything oked dark against Alice, but her face none could look upon id pronounce her vile. The time for the trial drew nigh, and the prospects of Alice sew more gloomy. Other additional stories were fabricated, it Alic', conscious of her own purity and rectitude, believed at God would deliver her. The day before the trial Brooks rived. Wayland ceased to call on her, and she was for- 6ken by the one who had vowed that he would stand by and ,fend her. Some divine monitor whispered to Alice, fear not. he prayed for strength to nerve her for the, last conflict with )pressive misfortune, for she felt that if this terminated rainst her, the grave would hide hei from the pursuit of the lumniator, and she would soon be forgotten.. Alice did not ant to die disgraced. She wanted to prove herself that hich she had professed to be; so that the church of God, the abbath school, and the temperance cause, should not be sgraced and persecuted, and the cause of religion and virtue ounded. This was the greatest concern of her soul. Court week came, and Doctor Wells came not. The Court as organized, and yet the Doctor did not appear; neither id Alice's attorney appear-he had either been bribed, or     42       ETHE SCROLL AND LOCKET. despairing success in her cause, had absented himself to save his reputation. Tuesday was the day set for the trial, and Alice was without witness or counsel. Another day and night of bitter anguish hung over her bursting heart, and then perhaps the gloom would close upon her forever. But the future will tell. tf .  A.}    CHAPTER IV. At the close of Chapter II we left Emma and Worthington upon the Mound, from which they returned to pursue the meandering programme of fortune's bewildering way. Emma was to be married in October. Often would she repair to her secluded retreat to prepare her heart for the change that was so soon to come. "Oh!" said Emma, "how solemn to me is the thought of marrying in autumn-if it were in spring, then would sweet blossoms and clasping vines spring up at my feet; but in sear and yellow autumn, I must bid my flowers, my birds and bower farewell; but it is so, and I am content." Emma's childlike gayety was soon exchanged for the calm and placid graces of riper years, like the little sparkling rill, loses its merry ripple in the quiet deep. Worthington searched Alice's letters in vain, for some clew to her whereabouts, and was vexed to think that part of her name was concealed; There was Alice, but what was the rest? Little James had told him that his name was James Lovel, but whether that was Alice's name or not, he could not tell, and if so, he saw no reason why she. did not subscribe it in full, and what more excited his curiosity, was that she should keep herself secluded in a Western village, and be afraid to write the name thereof to her mother. This all seemed dark to Worthington, but some latent energy, some mysterious power impelled him on to seek the fair Alice, and     "       THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. solve the mystery that seemed to be connected with her life. There were her own letters, written by her own hand. .Wor- thington looked at thim till he could almost see her little white fingers moving along the line. The more he read them the deeper he plunged into the stream of maddening love, and impetuous curiosity.' The style of the composition was beau- tiful, and the sentiment pure and holy, but there was a studied evasion of everything that would disclose her name or resi- dence; but the last letter made a remote allusion to some one whom she hoped never to see-here is the letter. "Cincinnati, June the 6th, 1839. "DEAR AMOTHER:-The sun is ever bright and ceases not to pour its flood of light upon the world, though clouds and storms arise, though the mantle of night fall upon us; it gives it hues to the rainbow, the moon and stars reflect back its glory, and daylight ever lingers on the globe. So, dear mother, does the light of hope ever play around the lonely heart. Though we be blasted by the chilling winds of adver- sity, and pinched by the cold hand of penury; though death come with its chilling touch, and close our eyes in the wake- less sleep of the grave, yet hope points to the blissful future and we follow its light to eternity. Oh! mother, I could not live, did not alluring hope ever shed its light upon my lone- some path, hiding with its trust of to-morrow the sorrow of to-day. Oh! my afflicted mother, could I once more see you! and press your troubled bosom, .then would my life be fresh again; but prophetic apprehension seems to whisper to my heart, that I shall see yon on earth no more. I would hazar4 everything but virtue and religion to be with you, but the peril through which I have already passed, warns Te that there is an impassable barrier between us. There is one whose search I must elude. I would rather be a wanderer in a strange land, without an earthly friend to cheer me; yes, I would rather starve in the wilderness, or pine my poor life away within a cheerless dungeon, than to fall into the hands of the destroyer. I will die, dear mother, as pure as thou   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.       45 hast taught me to live, and beyond the troubled waters we shall meet again. What shall I say to my poor father? Oh! mother, I am a premature orphan-my father is gone-the dark tide has rolled over him, and with fearful impetus he is sinking down, down. I love him, I have toiled and prayed, and at times hoped for his reformation; and if there is one of God's creatures against whom I would turn the bitter tide of my feeling, it is that one who tempted him to the alluring haunts of ruin. Should some sober moment ever come upon him, and steal back his soul from the fiery gulf that is burning within him, tell him that Alice still loves him, and bids him a long farewell. When I was yet young I viewed, with pride, the bright stars and stripes of my country, floating at the mast-head of our proud ships of commerce, and my bosom swelled with 'amor patriae,' as I beheld the poor emigrant, as he stepped upon our shore, stoop down and kiss the land of freedom.' But what is home without protection? what is freedom without security? alas! they are but empty sounds. There can be no liberty without law to restrain the hands of- vice. Unbridled passion and avarice have no bounds to mark their guilty 'steps, and where the civil authorities institute no barrier to their aggression, the weak must yield to become the slaves of the strong. 'Pro aris it focius,' was the sentiment that inspired our revolutionary fathers. Yes, 'for our altars and ourfiresides,' is the first and proudest boast of the Amer- ican statesman. Ye we behold the heart-broken wife and her starving children crushed with overpowering wretchedness and misery, dying by slow and cruel torture around the fireside, made desolate by the sanction of our statutes. Yes, mother, rum has stolen from us all that makes life desirable. It has squandered our property, scattered our family, and desolated our home. And has it not' worse than murdered?  It not my once affectionate and lovely sister a wandering maniac? That bright and glowing mind tlhat once lit up those sparkling eyes, as the sun lights up the stars, is now a world of ruined thought. Her heart was too sensitive to bear the shock of that sad incident, which I now forbear to mention. Oh! how     wan ovCivuj AND LOCKET. sweet she used to sing. Often does my mind wander back to that little babbling brook, upon whose green and flowery  margin sweet Laura used to sing me away to the land of dreams. Then, mother, we were happy and free; but those  days are gone to be recalled no more. It is hard that I dare not tell you where I am, but if you address your letters to Cincinnati, I can get them. Kiss little James for me. Now, mother, I must say farewell!  ALICE." Where this letter was written, or to whom it was directed,  Worthington could not tell. The envelopes were all gone; whether they had been accidentally lost, or intentionally destroyed, he knew not.  Worthington was not long in making up his mind to take a tour to the West, in search of Alice. Though he had come to rest from the labor of his studies, recruit his health, spend the summer with his uncle, and see his pretty cousin married in October, yet he was satisfied that he would not be long in i getting the consent of Emma, and he could feign some excuse for his departure that would abundantly satisfy his good-na-  tured uncle and unsuspecting aunt. Mr. Worthington was not long in making satisfactory arrangements for his depart-  ure. "To-morrow," he said to Emma, as they were seated alone in the parlor, "dear cousin, I must leave you; but I hope to be able to return by October. I go, Emma, not in obedience to the dictates of a groundless curiosity, I go not to explore visionary fields, in pursuit of airy phantoms, but I go under the manifest guidance of my own convictions of right; go in obedience to that high and holy monitor whose cease- less whisperings mark out the course of unerring duty. I can not rest whilst the obligations of that solemn promise is nconsummated. These papers must be of great importance to that poor homeless girl, upon whose heart lie the afflictions f a drunken father. Oh! Emma, so desolating, so horrid are he ruins of intemperance that I feel like devoting the ener- es of my manhood to the field of reformation. Innocent   childhood, helpless woman, broken-hearted wives, sorrow- stricken mothers, blasted youth, ruined manhood, and wither- ed age, rise up before me. I can no longer be indifferent to these appeals. Emma, I am a changed man-the wanton pleasures of luxury, the glittering and gorgeous display of wealth, to me, have lost their charms. There is nothing in them to expand the soul, or to inspire our immortal energies; but to save the ruined, bring the wanderer back, or to give joy to the lonely heart, awakens in the bosom a life-glowing rapture, as expansive as the song-of angels." "I love mankind the better for such noble sentiments/" said Emma.   "He who toils for human good, aspires to a higher destiny than the fickle votaries of popular amusement, and his reward shall be trophies which the perishing elements can never moulder back to dust: - It is a wonder to me how -any can be indifferent, whilst this destroyer of human happi- ness is luxuriating-in our midst." Next morning Worthington was on his way, before the light of day had disclosed to him an object for observation. Soon morning withdrew the curtain, and the first scene in the theatre of his new enterprise was before him. He found himself shut up in the old stage-coach with an individual, whose personal appearance was anything but prepossessing; he was something above six feet in height, lank and lean, with drooped shoulders, long arms and big feet; his mouth divided his face into two, seemingly, equal sections, leaving about the same amount of frizzley, red hair upon etch division. Which, notwithstanding it' was bounded above by a pair of large, flat, yellow eyes, and below by the huge prominence of a red nose, yet it seemed to assert its right to remain the prominent orna- ment of his expresssive, physiognomy. Worthington was as mute in his presence as he would have been in a den of hyenas. Ten miles rolled off, and the -painful silence' was, unbroken. At length the stage stopped, and a little pug- nosed, pock-marked Irishman was ushered in, who, no sooner caught a glimpse of the hairy man, than lie exclaimed: "'Pon me word, Mr. Goathead! it's yourself I'm glad to    48P      TIIE SCROLL AND LOCKET. be matin, gist at this time; I'm a little nady, and Id like for ye to be after paying me the wee trifle that's betwane us." "I owe you nothing," was the sulky reply of Goathead. "Ask your pardon, honey," said Pat. "I kept the account meself, and if ye'll gist look over it, ye'll find that there is four dollars and farty-eight cints comin' till me yet. I work- ed a hundred and fefty days, at siventy-five cints a day, that would make one hundred and twilve dollars and fefty cints. Well, fefteen dollars I took in store goods, that would lave ninety-siven dollars and a half; and me liquor bill, though it is a divil of a long one, only raches ninety-three dollars and two cints."e "You're a liar," roared Goathead, "and if you ever dun me for that again, you must be ready to hand in your check, for I will send you to hell on the express. I don't owe you a single brad, you d--d potatoe bug.  I will teach you better manners than to insult gentlemen on the public highway." Again all was silent, except the poor Irishman, whose grief at this harsh treatment, became uncontrolable. The stage again stopped, and the hairy man withdrew his annoying presence. "That's hard, stranger," said Pat, addressing Worthington; "to be chated by such a mon. He is the most cruel, hard- hearted crater on God's earth. His still-house runs a hundred barrel a day. So he took a large contract on the rail-road, put up little dram-shops on it, and paid his hands off in wheskey. Stranger, I am a writched mon. If I may be fray with ye, I will show ye a letter rom me own dear home beyond the waters;" pulling the letter from his pocket, "shall I rade it for ye?" "If you please," said Worthington kindly. "It is a little tadious" said Pat, "but as ye seem willing to listen, I will tell ye all about it. I am me father's only child. We were poor and had to work hard to make a leving in the ould country. Three years ago me father sold all the property that he had in the world, to get money to bring me to this country. Where, he said, I could soon make money   THE PSROLL AND LOCKET.       49 enough to bring me poor ould father and mother across the dape say, to spend their last days in happy America. I came, and I have worked hard ever since, now I haven't but a dollar in the world. This letter brings me news that my own mother has staved to death, and that me father is begging from door to door." (Pat stopped to wipe the tears from his eyes.) "It I had nivir drinked grog, stranger, I could have had me parents here, in a home of plenty. This is a happy country, blessed with iverything that's good, but I wish to God, stran- ger that I had niver put me fut upon it. The poor Irishman loves grog, here he can get it at ivery door. He works and digs, and toils, from morning till night, making your canals and rail-roads, and then, forgetful of his toil, his large heart throws it to the wind. Though I like it, stranger, and will spind the last cint that I have to satisfy me cravings, yet at this sorrowful moment of me life, I wish there was not a dram- shop in America. Yes, stranger, that's what I wish. Then, honey, this would be the happiest land on earth. The poor Irishman might then, well turn to it with a glad heart-then it would be endade the land of the fray, the home of the oppressed, a refuge from want and hunger. Yes, stranger, if there had been no grog-shops here, to-day, I might have been scattering the fruits of me labor at the fate of those I love." Again Pat stopped to wipe the tears from his eyes, and for some time sat weeping; at length he said again: "Stranger, I'm a ruined man. I have not told you all; perhaps it's not prudent that I should." "Go on," said Worthington, "I shall regard it as confiden- tial." "Well," said Pat, "as you seem to take an interest in the story of a poor Irishman, Ill tell ye all about it: there is one be- yond the blue waves that I love better than I love me own life. There," said he, presenting a tress of brown hair, "that's from the brow of me own swate Jenna. It was her that I vowed to lov?.only, and to return and make her mine. Then, stranger, I dramed of many bright and happy days to come; but me hopes are gone-the blossoms of my own native isle will 4     50       THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. bloom for me no- more. ,Jenna, I shall niver say her again; God bless her swate soul! And old Ireland, home of me childhood, God bless ye!" At this time Pat's grief choked his utterance, and for some moments he wept bitterly. Worthington himself was affected with Pat's unaffected story and flowing tears. "Well, Pat," said Worthington, "is there no hope of your reformation?" "Not whilst I can get it, stranger," said Pat. "Then," said Worthington, "I am sorry to say that I have no- hopes of your ever again meeting your friends. You have beautifully spoken the truth, and I love you for your candor. It is true, the sweat of the poor Irishman runs in streams along our public works, the rum-seller grows fat upon his- blood, and his bones lie buried far from his friends and 'home." "Here stranger," said Pat, "is my stopping place. I am sorry to lave ye. I love ye for your sympathy; but, honey, I'm a ruined man. I'm on me way as fast as the troubles of life can hurry me along. I'll drink to drown me sorrow. Good bye, stranger. God bless ye! I shall niver say ye any Mr. Worthington was then left alone in the old coach for the rest of the day. His mind ran back to the grotesque characters that had so well acted their part in the drama of human life. The ruined and the ruiner, the wretched and the wretch, had appeared together before him. The ruiner was turning God's beautiful grain into floods of poison, and send- ing it out in desolating rills through the land. The ruined was quaffing the envenomed stream, whilst his aged parents were starving to death for the bread from which it had beeni perverted. Next day Worthington arrived at Saratoga Springs, where he met with many of his old friends; also, warm-hearted rep- resentatives of nearly every State in our glorious Union. There were the old justfinishing the voyage of life, and the young just entering upon it, all passing rapidly down time's   THE SCROLL AND LOCIET.       51 restless stream, regardless of how swiftly they were all hur- rying on to eternity's fathomless ocean. A few mornings before Worthington left Saratoga, he was attracted to the drawing room by a gathering crowd. He approached, and heard a sweet voice and the smooth-gliding notes of a guitar. The ladies had come from their cells, and the gentlemen from the piazzas till the room was crowded so that Worthington could get no sight at the mysterious singer. She sang Irish melodies, Scotch airs, and old English songs, 'among which were the "Harp that once in Tara's Hall," "The Ingle Side," and "Oft in the Stilly Night;" those household words, domestic treasures, and holy spells, that conjure up the dead, and pour melody over the soul, from voices long silent. Some murmured applause, some sighed, many eyes. were wet from memory's opened fountain. Worthington was spell bound, large tears rolled down his cheek, and his bosom was heaving with the swelling waves of unconscious emotion. It seemed to him like the same soft, sweet voice that he had heard in the direction of the little Mound, and it seemed to bathe his soul in the same incomprehensible enchantment. The music ceased. "She is gone," said a voice in front. During the day Worthington tried to fix his eyes upon the ,one in whose soul slumbered such bewitching powers, such exhaustless power of smooth-gliding melody. That evening he was introduced to a minister from the city, who in conse- quence of ill health, was confined to his room. Worthington sat alone by his bed. The conversation turned upon the incident of the morning. "I never think,"' said the minister, "of that poor girl, but my soul grows tired of earth, and I long for the society of the better land, where the ruins of rum never break the heart, or wreck the mind. She is a maniac. I knew her before afflic- tion usurped the throne of her reason. I knew her in the smiling days of her childhood, when the promise of a bright future was before her.. I never knew one upon whom God had lavished his perfections with a more unsparing hand; her     52       THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. music yet excels any to which I have ever listened, its wild warbling sweetness overpowers my nature, opens the fountain of my soul, and the resistless tide of feeling carries my mind to the sweet blending harmony of the angelic'choir. She but seldom appears in a crowd; spending most of her time alone; though every one seeks her society. She never wants for anything, for innumerable gifts are bestowed upon her. She often travels with some wealthy family, to which she takes a liking. She sometimes disappears, and is not seen for many days, at which times it is supposed that she visits the western part of the State, where her little brother is buried. It was the death of this brother that blasted her mind. So sad is the tale, necessary to an explanation, that strength and feelings will not, now, permit me to relate it. God has recorded her ruin against the rum-seller, in the Great Book of Accounts, and in the judgment day he will call upon him to answer to  the charge." Next morning Worthington left with an excursion party that had come up the Hudson river, on the day before, from the city, and he never heard the minister's story of the unfor- tunate girl, whose song had so deeply stirred his feelings on the day before. Could it be that it was the Maniac of the Mound? Could it be the same voicedhat had so long reigned in the empire of his dreams? Could it be she that had planted the monument over the little grave, and came in the still night and called down the spirit of the little sleeper to com- mune with her lovely heart, and then wafted it back upon the wings of melody to the bosom of its God; to carry to heaven the sorrowing tales of earth? The party with which Worthington left soon reached Troy, and were on their winding-way down the beautiful Hudson,- along which nature unvails her grandest features. Mountains reaching four thousand feet toward the source of light, the eagle and the cloud perching upon their summits, and their tallest pines piercing the very Sky. Basins of water wrung from the mountain rock, sparkling in. flowery vales below, chafed into snow-white foam and feathery splendor, by the   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.       53 bounding cataract that leaps down the dizzy height; and beyond the hills rich-waving fields of grain, pouring their treasures at the reapers' feet. Worthington soon discovered that the beautiful steamer Troy was supplied with a filthy little bar, and that the ghosts of its ruin were stalking, spectre-like, through the crowd. After supper the barkeeper pushed a table before his nasty den, and placed a deck of cards upon it-cast a wistful look around the crowd-then stepped behind the counter to treat himself to a glass of punch, as much as to say, there are the implements, this is the starting point, and here is the example, now if u don't go to hell it isn't my fault. But finding that no per on would come and play for grog, he gave a red face the wink, and was soon seated with him at the card table. Then they must have partners, and each passer-by was solicited to take a game for mere amusement. A youth was looking on, and soon induced to play. The other partner being supplied, the game commenced. The last two beat, you might be certain, the two best out of three. Then they must  play for something to drink. The last two hesitated, but con- fident of success, they were soon persuaded. They played and won, played again and won. The barkeeper being needed so frequently in the bar, he withdrew, and his place was sup- plied by another to whom he gave the wink. The four con- tinued to play, until it was evident that the lad and his partner were worse of the drink. Then it was proposed to play for money,-a mere trifle was the first stake, for which a few games were played, the youth and his partner winning every time. Then they played for a larger sum and lost. About this time Worthington withdrew and entered the ladies' cabin. In the door of which stood an aged lady, looking sorrowfully towards the card table. He soon discovered large tears rolling down her furrowed cheek. She turned from him and wiped them away, but others came. At length Worthington ventured to ask her if he could render her any service. She thanked him and replied: "That her son was at the card-table, and that from his im-     54       THE SCIROLL AND LOCKET.  petuous disposition, she feared that something serious would bppen, but that a stranger would have no influence with him in is present state of mind. He is intoxicated," she said'  again bursting into tears. "I am a lonely widow, that is my only child, the hope of my declining years."  Worthington finding that he could be of no service to the  weeping mother, went upon the deck, as he passed by the  card-table the youth pulled out a purse, and swore that he "would either break or be broken." It was not long before a gentleman came up and informed him that the youth had lost  all his money, and had staked his gold watch and chain. Soon another one came from below and said, that he had lost his watch and chain, and had staked a beautiful diamond ring. At this time Worthington started down. Soon the sound of  boisterous and angry words reached his ear. "I will have that  ring or die," he heard articulated. Then came the jar of a I scuffle, then the jingle of broken glasses, then the report of a I pistol, and before he could reach the cabin, the tragedy was  ended. The youth, inflamed by liquor, and enraged at losing  his money, his watch, and that which he esteemed more highly  than all, the diamond ring, a token of his young love. le  grabbed for the ring, and failing toget it, he gathered a glass  tumbler, and hurled it at the gambler's head, which took effect  upon the right temple, and severed the temporal artery. He fell, the blood gushed in torrents, but he was soon upon his  feet, drew a pistol, and fired, the ball passed through the left - lung and lodged in the spine; the youth fell and expired i without a struggle, but the hemorrhage was soon checked from the wounds of the gambler, and he was set off at West Point to be sent to the Oran ounty jail, to await his trial, but the body of the youth was taken to Jersey City to be interred by the side of his father, who had but recently died. No language can present to the mind of the reader the solemnity of that scene. The poor mother fainted, and for some time it was thought that she would never rally, and when she regained power to move and speak, she wrung her hands and beat her breast in the most deplorable anguish,   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.       55 calling upon God, in piteous tones, imploring him to take her from this world of sorrow, and lay her in the grave beside her murdered son. The hardest hearts were melted to sympathy, and there were few who did not weep. It was near sunset when the boat landed at West Point, and a large party assembled upon the deck, to take a view of the beautiful scenery that surrounds that romantic spot. Soon the conversation turned upon the afflicting incident which had just transpired. "I attribute it all to whisky," said an aged man, with a straight-breasted coat and a broad-brimmed hat. "It is one of its legitimate offsprings, and I would rather ride in a soap- cart, than in a steam-boat with a grog-shop on it, for there I might have my feelings and my sentiments respected, but I cannot in a dram-shop, where men get drunk and gamble, murder and steal." "If you were not an old man," said the captain, "you could not talk that way about my boat." "Old and frail as I am," replied the old gentleman, "these are my sentiments, and no earthly power shall wrest them from me. I paid you, sir, for a right upon this boat, not, sir, for the little space that I occupy, or the morsel that I eat, but the right to be protected from insult and injury, the right to have respected the sentiments that God has breathed into my soul." "You mean," said the Captain, "the right to do as you please, and you should be williug to allow others the same liberty." "I mean no such thing," said the old man. "I mean what I say," turning a sharp look upon the Captain. "Liberty! do you know anything about liberty? Before you breathed or the world was troubled with your presence, I fought for liberty, sir. -Go read the revolutionary reminiscences that cluster along these banks. Go to Tarrytown, Stony Point, and West Point, and you will behold the theatre of my actions.

Not the     O       TTHE SCROLL AND LOCKET. liberty to get drunk, insult and abuse others, and become a pecuniary burden to community.  Not the liberty to sell whisky and spread desolation and ruin around me. Not the liberty to do wrong. That liberty I have ever prayed God to withhold from me, but liberty to do right, and protection from wrong. Liberty to worship Almighty God as my conscience might dictate, without being insulted therein by ruffians and blackguards. It wasthat which nerved me in the battles of the revolution. It was that liberty that inspired our little band with that sublime patriotism which marks the brightest page in the history of the world. Brainless demagogues, insignifi- cant upstarts, and soulless rum-sellers are eternally prating about -liberty. Liberty to sell whisky, desolate happy homes,  blast and wither society, fill earth with the sorrowing, and hell with the damned. Was that the liberty for which your fathers shed their blood? Was that the liberty, sir, for which Washington so devoutly prayed, when the dark cloud of  impending ruin hovered over our country. And now, Cap- tain," said the revolutionary father, "since you have seen fit to take exceptions to the sentiments of an old man, who has slept many a night upon the cold ground, and braved many a  storm upon these banks before you was born, I ask but one favor at your hands, that is to land and set me on the shore;  and although I am many miles from home, I will travel it alone on fbot, before I will ever again set my feet upon a floating grog-shop."  The old man being unyielding in his purpose, the Captain landed him, and he trudged on his way down the shore, upon his staff, singing with a trembling voice: "Are there no foes for me to face? Must I not stem the flood? Is this vile world a friend to grace, To help me on to God? Since i must fight if I would reign, Increase my courage, Lord; I'll bear the toil, endure the pain; Supported by thy word.   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.        57 Thy saints in all this glorious war, Shall conquer, though they die- They see the triumph from afar; By faith they bring it nigh." "It is no wonder," said Mr. Pumroy, a Presbyterian min- ister, who had attentively" watched the movements of the old man, "that the British lion yielded before such spirits as that. You might as well try to move the rocky basis of these ever- lasting hills, as to swerve him from his purpose. God bless such men! I wish the world had more of them." "I think he is too rigid," replied Mr. Clink, a member of the same church. "I like to see men religious, but I think he is too fastidious, too unbending." "God is unbending," replied the minister, "and his unvary- ing laws perpetuate the harmony of this beautiful world. I would to God that we were all as unswerving, and as consis- tent as that old man. Then would grog-shops, and the with- ering urse of intemperance fall before our influence, as leaves before the shivering winds of autumn. That old man is as valiant in the battles of the Lord as he was in the battles of his country, and if the Christian world was united in a band of faithful brotherhood, inspired by his energy, the victories of the cross would soon extend as far as the human voice has broken the silence of the desert." "How," said Mr. Clink, "could the church exert an influ- ence for the suppression of intemperance?" "By conforming its members to teetotal abstinence, and by supporting no man for office-from fence-viewer to president- who is not in favor of prohibiting the sale of intoxicating drinks as a beverage," said Mr. Pumroy. "I think," said Mr. Clink, "that the church would lose much of its influence by taking such an unpopular course." "God send how soon the church may shake off the influence of rum-sellers and demagogues, shake off its popularity-seek- ing propensity; and expand to its native usefulness. Uncom- promising opposition to every evil, is the only course that will render the church worthy of the smiles of a just God, and *f     T UBat SCROLL AND LOCKET.  place our feet upon that immutable rock, against which it is  said, 'the gatea of hell shall not prevail,"' said Mr. Pumroy  "Your doctrine would unite Clurch and State," remarked a quack lawyer, who was listeningta e dialogue.  "Excuse me," said Pumroy, "I must pronounce you sadly mistaken; in a free government where thought is unfettered Church and State cannot be united, that is an obsolete idea. I desire no such union, but union between Rum and State is already formed, and for one I shall cease not to toil till that  union is dissolved. The Church, sir, has a higher mission  than that of controlling the departments %f government. But when government tolerates a policy, the tendency of  "which is to subvert the morals of the people, and spread sin  and misery over the land, the Church has a right to oppose it, and it would be recreant to its trust if it did not oppose it, in the pulpit and at the ballot-box. The perpetuity of this gov- ernment depends upon the influence of the church, in the pre- servation of wholesome morals and vital religion." At this point the conversation was interrupted by the announcement that the City was in view. Next day Worthington, by request, accompanied the corpse of the murdered youth to the home of the bereaved widow, and saw it deposited in the still grave, amid the thick-falling tears of a loving mother and sympathizing friends. All were sorrowful who knew the brilliant minded David Everett, and knew that he was no more. His poor mother never recovered from the shock. In a few months she was laid beside her lamented son. There, Rum, sleep thy fresh victims! Thy dark record  swells as the events of life pass before us,   COHAPTER V. Two weeks after Worthington left the town of W---- , Walter Emet received the following letter, from the City of New York, under the signature of an eloquent and zealous advocate of the temperance cause: "Newz York, July the 27th, 1839. "WALTER EMET, ESQ.-Sir:-A few weeks since the friends f of temperance picked up a poor inebriate from the street in a state of insensibility. Hle was kindly nursed, and for some days it was thought that he never would recover. The state of death-like stupor in which We found him was followed by a stage of low muttering delirium. When that passed off, he was so enervated he could not stand alone, or hold a cup of water to his own parched lips. Hie begged for strong drink, and on finding that he could not get it, he asked for an instru- ment of death, by which to terminate his wretched existence. When he was asked if he had any family or end-i the city, he wept bitterly and said, 'that he had a starving iife and child on a certain alley.' A messenger was sent to look them up, and provide for their wants, but they were not to le found. On enquiry, we learned that the unhappy wife was dead and buried; but of the little boy, we could hear nothig. Whien this intelligence was communicated to him, his rief drove him to madness, and we had to confine him, to ep him from committing violence upon himself. hen he became     60       THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.         j more calm and capable of appreciating the reality of iis own  ruin, we asked him to sign the pledge; he turned his eyes  toward heaven, fell upon his hneesi (the tears rolled hiok down his swollen cheeks,) and replied: 'Yes, by the help of God I will die a sober man.' With trembling hand he wrote ' his name, and sealed his signature with drops of grief. To-day he disclosed to me the most heart-rending story of the ruins of rum to which I have ever listened. It is often said that temperance men are fanatics, that/their zeal leads them beyond the bounds of reality, that they gather their characters and incidents from the airy wastes of imagination, and paint them with the gorgeous tinselings of fiction. But the ravages of intemperance are sad realities; realities more thrilling than the wildest fabrications of creative fancy. No language can delineate its horrors, no painter can throw its colors upon the canvas. This wretched victim-is now before me, and my heart sickens at the pieture that his history presents to my mind. My feelings are elicited in his behalf, and I never have seen one for whose reformation I felt a deeper concern. He used to be a citizen of your town, and says he was fraudulently dispossessed of some valuable real estate in your vicinity, the description of which you will find herein. You will please examine the records of your county, with reference to its title. If you can recover it for him, arvaluable fee shall be your reward.        Yours, &c., S . T. MLLS." Walter Emet was the son of a poor widow in Oxford, Mass. His father was one of those unfortunate individuals, to whom we have so often had occasion to allude, who drown their immortal aspirations in the deep oblivion of the bowl, and whose misery and degradation mark the darkest page upon the history of our country. Walter Emet rose above the clouds that intemperance had hung around the home of his childhood. In defiance of opposing obstacles, he had acquired a splendid education, and was profoundly versed in the law. For nine long months his office had been open, and no client had come to seek his counsel.  His means were about   THE. SCROLL AND LOCKET. ,      61 exhausted,i and the gloom of neglected merit, and professional i disappointment was gathering thickly around him Thire was but one to whom Walter had entrusted a knowl- edge of his past history, and his present embarrassment. That one was Emma Clinton; Emma was a true and noble- hearted girl. She immediately went to work to win for her lover the powerful influence of her family, which she was not long in accomplishing. Mr. Emet was both surprised and delighted at receiving the above letter. He did not know that he had a friend in the city, nor could his most extravagant dreams have conjured up a cause more to his liking than the one that was now submit- ted to him. He went to the record, and run out the chain of title, and found that there was a link broken between the present possessor and his client, and that if certain papers could be produced, the land could be recovered. These facts he immediately communicated to the interested party; in answer to which he was informed that the papers were in existence, but what few goods the poor man had, were sold for rent, and unless his unhappy wife had submitted them to the keeping of some one, in all probability, they would never be recovered; but that no pains should be spared to look them up. This news cast a shadow over the hopes of Mr. Emet. He was puzzled to know how to proceed further in the cause, in which his feelings and energies were already elicited. He communicated his perplexity to Emma, who, after hesitating some moments, replied: "I believe that Worthington has in his possession the iden- tical papers, for which you are so anxiously seeking-a secret whibh I was obligated not to disclose, except it became neces- sary for the good of the parties interested, and I believe the present circumstances clearly justify me in doing it." She related to Emet what Worthington had told her on the Mound, and pledged him to keep it concealed from the public ear, for the present at least. This disclosure aroused Mr. Emet's curiosity, and gave new impulse to his energies. "J'ai bonne cause," said he, turning to Emma. "I will     62       THE SCROLL AND LOCKETr seek out the papers, recover the land, and expose an abject villain, to the scorn and contempt of the world. The prop- erty is now worth ten thousand dollars. By the help of God I will blow that still-house and those grog-shops to their native hell. Excuse me, Emma, for the use of that epithet; my feelings will allow me to use no other. My soul is embit- tered against these institutions of iniquity. The first lesson that my dear mother ever taught me was to love God, the second was to abhor the grog-shop and hate intemperance. Well might she teach me to hate them, for many a night have they sent me to bed cold and hungry, and bathed my slumber in that fond mother's tears. Strange as it may seem to you, Emma, I frankly acknowledge that I fear them; I feel inse- cure in their midst. I love and almost constantly crave the stimulating cup. I have long felt it my duty, Emma, to make to you this honest confession. I have often wished that I could undo this mysterious existence, and tear from my nature that appetite, which I inherited from my father. There is a deep mystery connected with the family of my client. To-morrow I shall start for the City, where I hope to gain some means to solve it," The person who had obtained the fraudulent title was Simon Gouty, the-hairy man with whom Worthington was housed in the stage-coach on the morning that he left, and the still- house, to which the Irishman referred, which run its hundred barrels a day, was erected on the land which Emet was seeking to restore to its proper owner. The same Simon Gouty was proprietor of the two whisky-shops of the village, one of which he kept himself, in the character of a tavern. He was the personification of what was called, at that time, the whisky influence. That influence which was very formidable, he had exerted against Mr. Emet; it is, therefore, not strange that no ' love existed between the two. Mr. Emet had a personal interview with Mr. Mills and the reformed inebriate, in whose welfare he was taking so much interest. "I went to your village," said the latter, "with a determi.

As soon as I tasted the poison, I had no power to control my appetite, and I plunged heedless down the gulf of ruin. There the curtain drops upon my memory. What has passed since seems like wandering dreams. I feel like one who had awaked from a troubled sleep." Mr. Emet could learn nothing of him by which he could find Alice. On his return, a gentleman got into the stage at Clarksville, who at first seemed to be. quite genteel, but soon showed symptoms of intoxication, and became boisterous and vulgar. At length he drew a letter from his pocket, and took a seat on the opposite side of the stage, evidently for the purpose of reading it. After he had perused it for some time, he placed it carefully in his pocket again, and drew from another pocket a flask, and drank largely of its contents. It was not long till he was in a state of insensible stupor, and lay stretched upon the entire length of the seat. The jostling of the stage jolted the letter from his pocket, and it slipped behind the cushion. When the stage reached Monticello, his stopping place, he had to be carried into the hotel. Soon after the stage again strarted, Mr. Emet discovered the letter, drew it from its hiding place, and examined its contents, and to his surprise, it was written above the signature of Alice Lovel, directed to Doctor Wells, Clarksville, New York. "I have found it," said Emet to himself, he being alone. "I will stop at the next station, and return; this letter must be returned; that poor girl is in trouble, and there is no time to lose. There is something in this letter that I cannot understand, and it seems strange that any one should appeal to a drunkard to rescue them from the hands of a drunk- ard."        ' When Emet reached Monticello, the gentleman had left by" private conveyance, but Emet resolved to prosecute his mis- sion. When he found Doctor Wells, he was not the man for whom he was seeking, and he was at a loss to know how to explain the object of his visit.     "       THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. As the Doctor seemed to be a very affable gentleman, Mr. Emet was soon engaged with him in an interesting conversa- tion upon the temperance question, which was then agitating the public mind, which gave Mr. Emet an excellent opportu- nity to allude to the object of his visit to the City. "Can it be possible," said the Doctor, "that Charles Lovel is yet living?" "He is, a reformed man,' said Mr. Emet, with proud satis- faction. "Thank God for that," responded the Doctor, raising to his feet. "Are you acquainted with Charles Lovel?" said Emet. "I am not," said the Doctor, "but there is one lonely heart to which that news will send a thrill of inexpressible rap- ture." "it seems strange," said Emet, "that none can tell me of Alice-could I (find Alice, the object of my mission to the City would be c  nsummated." The Doctor turned a confused look upon Mr. Emet when he mentioned the name of Alice, the blood flushed upon his cheek, and said: "Alice Lovel mysteriously disappeared from the City more than two years since, and it is generally supposed that she is dead." "Alice Lovel yet lives, but where, I cannot tell," answered r Mr. Emet, and then related the circumstance that had occur- red in the stage on the day before. '"Let me see the letter," said the Doctor, eagerly, extend- ing his hand to receive it, and as his eyes ran over it his nerves trembled with excitement. After he had perused it, he exc imed: 'God have mercy on my brother man! What fathomless depts of sin lie slumbering in his heart, poisoning the foun- tains o  nature, and ever watering his restless passions. Sin makes him a discordant element in the works of Almighty God. The worlds move on with undeviating precision in their respective spheres. No discord ever disturbs the beautiful   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.       65 harmony of the stupenduous universe; myriads of living crea- tures move on as God has directed them, to the accomplish- ment of -their destiny; but man turns his back upon the Creator, and sorrow and misery, the fruits of his disobedience, spring up around us. This letter is for me. It has been stolen from the post-office. This letter is the last and only hope of a poor lonely girl, who was torn from her mother's arms by the ruthless hand of intemperance, turned from her father's door, stolen from her friends, banished from her home and hunted down in her retreat, by its lawless and rapacious votaries; and assaulted by withering scandal in a land of strangers. I am the only man by whom she can prove these vile charges to be infamous falsehoods. I have no doubt that the scoundrel who stole this letter has answered it in my name, and that Alice is reposing in the confidence of my pro- tection. By the help of God she shall not be disappointed. In two days more it would have been too late., Alice Lovel is a heroine, unexcelled by the proudest examples of boasting history. She is a model for the imitation of others, and illus- tration of never-yielding virtue." Then turning to Mr. Emet, he continued; "Stranger, I thank you for this favor, The interest that you have taken in this letter is an evidence of the goodness of your heart, and merits, for you, my utmost confidence and kindest regard. The stage leaves Clarksville this evening at seven-I have but four hours to prepare for my departure--I will be ready and accompany you westward. I have patients, but they have friends and money. I will dispatch a messenger forthwith to tell them to send for another Doctor. Welcome, Mr. Emet, to the hospitalities of my house-excuse my presence, I must arrange." This was all said without a moment's pause, giving Mr. Emet no chance to reply, or ask a question; and when the Doctor withdrew, he was left to meditate, in perplexity, on what he had said. Had he had the full explanation which the Doctor afterward gave him, all would have been clear to his 5     "       THE SCROLL A6D LOCKtT. comprehension, but there was then no time for the Doctor to explain--not a moment was to be lost.  Doctor WIls was, what might be called, one of God's noble- men. He lived to make the world better, and although he was in what is called good circumstances, yet he seemed to care but little for the fortune or favor of the world. Now while he is preparing for his departure, and Mr. Emet is wrapt in strange meditations, we will relate an anecdote illus- trative of his character. The Doctor was proposed by his numerous friends as a suit- able candidate for Congress. There was but one thing that stood in the way of his election; he had joined the cold-water pledge-he was a temperance man. If he would renounce that, his election would be certain. A committee was appoint- ed, who waited on the Doctor, in person, and laid the facts before him, to whom he replied as follows: "Gentlemen, you will please accept of my thanks for your kindness, and your flattering appreciation of my ability. Allow me to assure you, that I love my friends, and for their happiness would sacrifice sleepless nights, and days of toil; but so help me God, I wpuld not sacrifice my own cohvictions of right for all the political emolument, gems, crowns, and kingdoms of this world." A few minutes past seven o'clock the Doctor and Mr. Emet were seated, together; in the stage. By this time Mr. Emet had determined to accompany the Doctor on his mission, and offer to Alice his professional service. At Amboy, N. J., they took the cars for the Delaware river, upon which there were three convicts destined for the penitentiary, at Trenton. Among them was quite a youth, who seemed to be much affected, and he wept incessantly. He tried to hide his face from the gazing spectators; the most of whom seemed to regard his grief with entire indifference. "4This is a cold-hearted world," said the Doctor, turning a look upon the crowd.; I cainnot be indifferent while others weep around mew-I must talk with him, Mr. Emet, and do what is in my power to soothe his sorrow."   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.       67 He approached the sheriff and asked permission, which being granted, he took a seat in front of the young convict, and by kind words soon got him into conversation, and drew from him the following confession: "My name is Amos Wilkey-I am not quite twenty-one years old. My father was a ship-carpenter, in Brooklyn, N. Y., and when I was quite small we had a home, and were happy, but he soon became a drunkard, and our home and furniture were sold at sheriff's sale.. After that my little sister and I often cried for bread-my mother became a washer-woman, and wore out her life to provide for our wants. My father would come home drunk, and beat her cruelly, and take from her the money which she had thus earned, buy whisky with it, lie drunk in the bed, and make my mother sit up all night, or lie on the floor. My poor mother soon became consumptive, and died when I was ten years old. My sister was then hired in the factory, and I went to live with a man by the name of Tucker, who kept a grocery. My father drew my sister's earnings and spent it for drink, and often made me steal whisky for him out of Tucker's cellar. Tucker soon put me behind the counter to sell liquor, and there I contracted habits that have proved my ruin. About three years since I went to the City of New York, and engaged at a livery-stable as a hack-driver. I often visited Ball's saloon, where I became acquainted with a gentleman from the South, b;the name of Brooks, who bribed me to do the first great wrng of my life, a deed which I am solemnly sworn not to tell, and one which I never could have been persuaded to do if I had been duly sober." The Doctor asked him to give him some intimation, by which he might judge of the crime. "Do you live in the City of New York?" asked Wilkey. "I live not far from it," answered the Doctor. "Pehiaps, then," said Wilkey, "you recollect that a young lady mysteriously disappeared from the City, about two years since." "Yes," said the Doctor, with suppressed emotion.     438       THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. "She was taken off at night in a closed carriage, and I have seen the driver," said the youth.' "Soon after this occurrence, I ran off from the City, and came to New Brunswick, where I committed the crime for which I am now in chains. Had I never drank liquor, I would, to-day, have been innocent and happy. When I am sober it is not in my heart to do wrong- F when I am drunk I cannot do right. "There," said the poor youth, the tears streaming down his cheeks, as he pulled from his pocket a worn volume, "this was my mother's bible-all the legacy that she had to leave me, and the richest treasure that she could have beqeathed me, had I obeyed its precepts. . It was her way-mark to the better land, and she left it to guide her poor orphan boy to where the cold winds of adversity never chill the lonely heart; but whisky turned me from my mother's instructions. My poor sister is ruined; where she is I will not tell. My father fills a drunkard's grave, and I long to die and hide myself from the shame that I have brought upon me." After this was said, the young man covered his face and wept. The Doctor turned him to the precious promises of his mother's bible, and told him it was wrong to be dissatisfied with the life that God has given him, but that we should im- prove each golden moment as it passes, for upon them are suspended the awful consequences of vast eternity. "Hope forever," said the Doctor, "you are young, your time will soon expire, and if you are good you may be reprieved, and yet be useful and happy." "Here," said the Doctor, addressing those who had gathered around to hear this confession, "is a sad commentary upon our laws and institutions. Here is a praotioal illustration of the ruinous consequence of licensing or tolerating grog-shops. We license the rum-seller, for five or ten dollars, to scatter crime and misery over the land, as thick and fast as the simoom scatters the desert sand, then tax the people hundreds to forge chains, erect gallowses, build jails, penitentiaries, poor-houses, and asylums, for felons, murderers, paupers, and lunatics. Law. is said to be the perfection of reason; but   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. '69 reason looks down from her proud throne of light, and scorns a law licensing grog-shops, a law creating nurseries of offense, so that we may enact others to punish the offenders; a law sanctioning the cause, and forbidding the effect. Reason owns it not-reason spurns it. Would reason, to protect the people from sickness and distress, strow every highway with poison- ous serpents, and fill the air with the breath of pestilence? We are told that it is unconstitutional to prohibit rum-shops; if it be, I am a traitor to the constitution, and scorn with utter contempt the power that binds me to its observance. The constitution, our country's great Magna Charta, designed by our fathers'to protect us against wrong and oppression, and make us virtuous and happy, is appealed to, in justifica- tion, of our national sins and private vices. I have heard this appeal so often made, that I am sick of the sniveling cant, and I hate the demagogue upon whose lips it lingers." Two days have passed, and our two friends are again in the stage, crossing the Alleghany Mountains. Night has closed around them. The dark clouds of an impending storm is lowering over them, forked lightnings are flashing athwart the sable concave. Deep-toned thunders are responding in the distance, and the tall chestnut-trees are swaying before the excited winds. The stage halted before the hut of a mountaineer, to wait till the storm had passed. The passengers entered the wretched abode, and an affecting scene, in the tragedy of intemperance, was before them. All was still; the dim-flick- ering light of a log fire revealed to them a mother, who lay in the middle of the-- or. Her head was cleft by an axe, and her brains had pour d from the fatal wound, and the blood had flowed in pools round her. A babe was yet nursing at her bosom, with its tiny arms folded around her neck. The father was lying stretched before the fire, one hand was tightly grasping the handle of a jug of whisky, which was besmeared 'with blood and brains, the other a razor with which he had cut his throat. The blood from the wound had flowed down and mingled with that of his murdered wife.     70       THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. At this sight a lady passenger fainted, and had to be carried back to the stage. "My God!" said Emet, "let's leave this fatal spot. I would rather brave the mountain storm, than look upon this scele." "This babe must not be left here," said Doctor Wells, who gathered it up, wiped the blood from it, folded it in his arms, and started with it, on foot, for an inn, a distance of three miles down the mountain. By this time the night was intensely dark, and the rain was falling in torrents. They' could see nothing, only when the lightning would flash before them; but they reached the inn with their little charge, about midnight. Where they reported the sad incident above detailed. About three o'clock the stage came up, and they were soon again on their journey. When Doctor Wells heft the child he wept freely, and turned to the landlord and handed him twenty dollars to be appropriated to the use of the child. After the passengers were again seated, some miles rolled away before a word was spoken. "I hope,"'said an aged man, after a long sigh, "to never again look upon such a scene as I last night beheld." "The laws of our country," said Mr. Emet, "offer us no protection against such outrages. We have game laws to protect the beasts and birds of the forest against the ravages of the hunter, but none to protect our women and children against the desolating hand of intemperance." "I hope how soon," said the Doctor, "God may scatter light upon the public mind, that we may throw around our homes the protection of laws, founded upon reason and justice." By the time our two friends reached Pittsburgh, the Ohio river was swelled beyond its banks, and when they arrived at- Cincinnati, the country was inundated with a general flood. The stages could not run. It was Saturday. Court at F-   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.  '     71 commenced its session on Monday. Sixty miles lay between them and that point. "I will go the distance on foot," said the Doctor, "and swim the rivers, if I can get there no other way." "I will follow," said Emet.  They hired a private conveyance for a short distance, and then pursued their journey as above mentioned. Their arrival, and the incidents connected therewith, will be given in another chapter. ,      '      H APTE R VI. , It was Tuesday morning. The day had come, the hour was hastening, upon the result of which was suspended the destiny of Alice Lovel. It was a gloomy Autumn morning, and nature seemed to sympathize with her oppressed feelings. The heavens were hung in mourning, large tear drops were falling from the weeping clouds, the forest was shaking down its green glories, and the dove was cooing her lonesome fare- well to the fading landscape. Soon the old Court House bell tolled the hour of Court. Alice started, unattended by a friend, to meet the angry clouds of unwarrantable persecution. The only solace that lingered around her heart, was the faintly whispering hope, that Doctor Wells would yet come. When Alice reached the Court House, it was crowded to overflowing, and when she entered, every eye was fixed upon her. In a half hour the cause was called. Alice sat weep- ing. "Are you ready for trial?" said the Court. Alice rose to her feet, and turning to the Judge, said: "I am here to defend myself against a cruel and malicious slander. I am here without a friend-my Attorney has been bribed not to appear in my defense. I have written to my friends, and, for days, have been expecting their arrival. Why they have not come, I cannot tell. Although I am here without the means of my defense, yet I can turn unblushingly   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.  '    73 to God, and claim his protection. I have ever toiled to be good; I have waded through deep afflictions; I have ever trusted in the God of mercy, and hitherto He has been my deliverer; I cannot think that he will suffer'me, now, to fall by the hands of those from whom he has delivered me in other days. I look back upon the the past, now forever gone; dear memories of youth, loving friends, and childhood's sportive days, cluster around me, and again I feel the joy of other years. The tide of time rolls on, and I am bearing down upon its rapid billows to the home of my departed friends. This world is embittered by rankling discord, friendship's broken chain, and alienated affections; yet I affectionately adore God that I love all; I cannot live and hate; I cannot live and cease to toil, in the cause of God, virtue and human happi- ness, though the enemies of good cast out my name as evil, and heap odium and falsehood upon my character. "I am, for the first time in my life, before a court of justice, I am wholly unacquainted with its usages, and the technicalities of law. I tremble not, though it is a solemn thought, of standing- before the awful Judge of the world, in the great day of eternity; but I cannot bear the gloomy thought of lying down in the grave of infamy. Oh! God, come to my rescue!"    ( As this prayer 4as uttered, two manly forms were seen pressing through the crowd, toward the bar. "I am in time, thank God!" said Doctor Wells, overpow- ered with emotion. Alice heard his voice, recognized it, swooned and sunk back. The Doctor caught her in his arms, tears rolled down his cheek. The Judge sat pale and motionless, and the crowded Court House seemed spell-bound, at the incident that was transpiring before them. At length the Judge rose and dismissed the cause, till the next day at ten o'clock. This interval gave Doctor Wells and Mr. Emet a chance to learn all the facts connected with it. "I will appear as her Attorney on to-morrow," said Mr.     74       THE SCROLL' AND LOCKET. Emet, "but you must not think strange, if I pursue a singular course." The next day at ten o'clock the cause was called. The Court House was crowded to suffocation. Doctor Wells rose, in accordance with a previous request of Mr. Emet's, and asked the Judge, who was Alice Lovel's Attorney. "She has none," said the Judge. At this moment Mr. Emet rose before him, and said, with a clownish air: "I'll be her lawyer." This set the members of the bar to giggling. "Can you satisfy the Court," said the Judge, "that you have a standing in the legal profession?" "May be I kin," said Emet, awkwardly, approaching him with some papers for his inspection, and stumbling over a chair. This movement brought down peals of laughter from the entire crowd. The Judge looked over the papers, and bowed to Mr. Emet, as much as to say, all right. The witnesses were then called and sworn. ' Flint's two attorneys supposed that Emet wassome back- woods pettifogger, and they treated him with indifference, and triedlto show their wit in the examination of the witnesses. Mr. Emet asked the  ys few questions, but carefully noted down the entire evice. "There," said oneof o lint's Attorneys, when Brooks was through giving his evidence, "that nails the hypocrite fast." Doctor Wells was called to the stand last, and his testimony seemed to astonish and affect all. When he was through Mr. Emet rose. All eyes were fixed upon him. "Oh!" said one, "I am sorry that Alice has such a bungling advocate." "I wish Tom Corwin was here," said another. Mr. Emet was of an Irish descent, and inherited all the peculiarities of the Irish mind. He was witty, quick to per- ceive, and ready to express. His heart was large. His feel- ings glowed with fervent devotion to the great cause of f*   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.   '    75 humanity and justice, and when quickened by the impulse of his own inherent order, his soul became impassioned, and his power of eloquence became irresistible. He was tall in stat- ure, beautiful in proportion, and graceful in his jestures. First he convulsed the Court with laughter at his wit, then he reviewed the evidence with logical precision, then sifted it to the wind; then he turned upon Flint a deluge of withering scorn and'contempt. Flint rose to leave the Court House Emet turned his flashing eye upon him as-he started, and said: '"Go, thou hell-commissioned villain, to do the work of thy father; the Devil." Next he turned upon the two Attorneys, who were defend- ing Flint, who also rose and left the room. "Go," said Emet, "follow your client, you fiMnabit-grog- shop-pettifoggers; go where the winds can fan the poison fumes of whisky from your breath." Then turning to Brooks, he said: "How dare you breathe God's vital air, you rerjured, loath- some scoundrel? Look at me! Do yt    ' me?"  Then pulling the letter which Brooks had lost inthe stage, from his pocket, and holding it up, said: ",)you know this, you pilfering sycophant?" Brooks being highly stimulated with liquor, at this appeal the blood rushed to his brain, and he fell to the floor in a fit of apoplexy, and next morning he was a corpse. No defense was made in the cause. The jury gave a verdict of two thousand dollars for the plaintiff. That night Flint absconded, and has never yet returned. Sleep, "kind nature's sweet restorer," which had long for- saken the tear-bathed pillow of Alice, came again and folded her in its balmy wings, and again she dreamed of better days to come. Next morning she was refreshed. The sky was clear, the clouds were'gone, and the burden was removed from her heart. Soon Doctor Wells and Mr. Emet called. on her, and informed her of her father's reformation. "My father!" said Alice. "Oh! my father, could I fly on     76       THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. the wings of the wind, soon would I fold my arms around thee. Can it be a reality? Oh! can it be that my father is a sober man?  This joy repays my sorrows, and again the stream of life flows fresh upon my heart. "Iay heaven bless the temperance cause! My heart is made glad by its triumph. Could my soul expand to the embrace of its desire, I would throw its light and protection around every poor victim of the bowl. Oh! for the triumph' of religion and virtue, over the rankling elements of sin and ruin! Oh! for the dominion of love and godliness, in the world! Oh! that God would pull down the cause of wioked- ness, and dry up the fountains of. misery, shut up the rum- shops, and save the poor inebriate from their wide-scattered desolations. Long have I toiled and prayed for their sup- pression, and many tears have I shed over their ruins. May the smiles of God ever linger upon those who labor in the cause of reformation! My father is a star in their crown, more dazzling, to me, than all the gems that glitter around the throne of monarchs. 'Let others toil for the fading laurels of earthly fame. When they have mouldered back to the dust, and their votaries sleep in the quiet ocean of oblivion, the fruits of the temperance reform will grow green, and ripen upon the wast-places of the blasted earth, and grateful hearts will raise up to bless the memory of those who have labored in its cause." Mr. Emet told Alice of the generous hearted Worthington; how anxiously'he was seeking her, and of the valuable papers which were in his possession. "This is a mysterious world of ever varying fortune," said Alice. "I feel lost in the perplexity of its unfolding arcana.  The next morning, after Alice had lavished her thanks on Doctor Wells and Mr., Emet, they bid her farewell. And again she was among strangers, alone; but soon Alice's old friends again flocked around her.   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.        " This is a deceitful world; and none have better expressed the character of its friendship than Sidney Dyer, as follows: "Earth's friendships ever thus are false, As baseless visions are; When naught is craved, they all would give, When much, they've naught to spare!" In a few weeks Alice received the following note from Harry Wayland: "Miss ALICE LOVEiL:-I have no words to express my regret at having forsaken you in the dark hour of need; I have never ceased to love, and by your permission, I will call and explain the motives by which I was actuated. I cannot live without your love." To which Alice replied as follows: "HARRY WAYAND:-Sir-For all the favors that you bestowed upon me, in other days, my heart cherishes a grate- ful appreciation. To you I can ever offer the hand of unaf- fected friendship, but to love you, permit me to say, frankly, I never can." "I will have revenge for slighted affection," said Wayland, when he read this note. "'If I cannot rule, I will ruin,' but this resolve shall be the secret of my own heart. The dark waves of the ocean hide many a ghastly form, while the sun- shine sparkles upon its unruffled bosom. So will I smile upon Alice, while this purpose is cankering in my breast." Wayland was then keeping the post-office, which furnished him means for the exercise of his unhallowed desire. Alice wrote to her father, and received the sad return that he had again become. a slave to his passion. She wrote again, and received no answer. She wrote to Doctor Wells; the answer was that he had gone to Europe for his health, and would probably never return. She wrote to Walter Emet, and received in reply, that Woithington was among the victims of a late steam-boat disaster, and that all was lost.     / 78       THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. Again Alice was beneath the clouds, and again the bitter winds of affliction blew upon her. Alice became, to some extent, melancholy. "Oh!" said she, to a friend with whom she was taking an evening walk, "were I like that little bird, I could fly away to where winter never comes; I could nestle in the evergreen bowers of the balmy South. But soon, I think, my spirit will take wings and soar to the never-failing verdure of eternal Spring, where I shall have a home, in my Father's house, where countless years and ceaseless ages shall mark the, era of my everlasting habitation." Farewell, Alice, for the present.   CH:APTEhR VII. In three weeks Walter Emet and Emma Clinton were to be married. Worthington had promised to return and be at the wedding. Then Mr. Emet expected to get possession of the papers, and restore to Charles Lovel his property. It was evening, Mr. Emet and Emma Clinton were sitting alone in the parlor. "In the morning," said Mr. Emet, "I must leave you, Emma, to visit my dear mother. I have not seen her for many years, I can neglect her no longer. I will bring her with me when I return, so that she may be present to bless our nuptials. I want to look upon her venerable form when we stand, together, at the altar--for some time I have had a struggle with my feelings whether to go or not; some myste- rious monitor whispers to me, don'tgo, but duty says go; I will obey duty, and trust to God for the result. Why I have had these feelings, I cannot tell. When I am gone, Emma, remember that my heart beats for you alone. "Here, Emma," said Emet, drawing from his pocket a curi- ously wrought gold chain, "keep this till I return. It contains fourteen links, all united to this circle, or ring; upon each link are two letters, and on the circle is my name in full. I will confide, to your faithful breast, an explanation of the same. T en years ago, at the hour of midnight, a light was seen in the old brick school-house, oi the commons, in my own native town. This light) which had been seen once each     80       THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. month, for three years, excited the curiosity of many an idle gossip some of whom declared the house was haunted, others believed it to be the council chamber of outlaws and assassins; a majority, however, agreed that it was a light, around which met some mystic brotherhood. Twenty young men, of whom I was one, formed themselves into a society for the purpose of social, moral, and mental culture, and for three years held regular secret meetings, the better to discipline their minds, and mature plans for their future intercourse with the world. This was their last meeting, and was protracted unusually late. I had often spoken to them on the subject of tempe- rance. For the last year I had been their presiding officer, and they all formed for me a warm attachment. They, on that night, presented me this chain, which, then, had nineteen links, each link representing an individual member, with the initials of his name thereon. These links were a pledge to me that they would never become intemperate. This chain I was to ever wear about my person, to remind me of those with whom I had been, so long, associated; and should any member violate his pledge, I was to remove his link there- from; and if I myself fell by the destroyer, then the links were all to be severed from the circle-then was the bond to be forever broken. Five links are gone, Emma; five of them sleep in a drunkard's grave, yes, five of the noblest of the band are no more. Each of these links is a token of love, and a pledge of fidelity. This ring is the bond of union, and unites me with the companions of my youth. God forbid that this bond should ever be broken! or another link severed therefrom! Should some accident befall me, should myste- rious fate still my heart, and I return no more, keep that, to remember me and my dearest earthly friends." Emet's voice trembled as he spoke these words, and Emma sobbed aloud. The parting kiss was given in silence, amid thick-falling tears. Emet pressed her to his bosom, then hurried from her presence, to give utterance to his feelings. Next morning he turned his face toward the home of his childhood, hoping soon again to meet the loved ones of other   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.       81 days. The third night, at eleven o'clock, the stage stopped before an inn of his native town, and soon Mr. Emet was embraced by his old friend, Dr. Waltz. He was unwell, chilled and weary, for he had traveled day and night. "Take some hot coffee, with a little good brandy in it," said the Doctor, "that will arouse your drooping energies, warm up your system, and quiet your nerves." "I dislike to take brandy," said Emet. "So do I," said the Doctor, "in any other way than as a medicine, there can be neither harm nor danger in thus using it. Take some, then go to a warm bed, and in the morning you will be another man." The doctor ordered the draught, and with his recommenda- tion, Mr. Emet swallowed it. Soon it aroused the lion which slept within him. The morbid cravings of an inherited appe- tite were awakened; and its burning thirst was irresistible- he went to the bar and called for brandy-drank largely, and wilder grew his insatiate mania. The throne of reason crum- bled beneath the touch of the raging demon within. Again he called for brandy-stronger brandy. "Give him no more, for God's sake," said the Doctor. The landlord heeded him not, but again set the bottle before him, saying: "If he is d-- d fool enough to kill himself, it's none of my business." Emet seized the bottle, and drained it of the last drop. Soon he became furious, and halloed and swore, wept, laughed and prayed alternately. "I am born for a mysterious destiny," said he, his eyes flashing fire, as he gathered the shovel, "and part of my mis- sion is to send you to hell," hurling it at the landlord, who fled to another room, and a glass was dashed to atoms against the door, as it closed behind him. "I am born for a myste- rious destiny!" again said Emet; then gathering a chair, he smashed it on the floor at the feet of Waltz; then he gathered another, and aimed it at his head. It missed him and went whizzing through the window into the street. Quickly he 6 \     82       THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. gathered another, and with supernatural power, sent it whirl- ing into the bar, crushing every glass and bottle within it. Then turning his eyes upward, he exclaimed, in a plaintive tone: "I am the son of a drunkard! The bond is broken! I was born for a mysterious destiny!" Soon after this he fell upon the floor, in a state of insensible stupor, from which he could never be aroused. At five o'clock in the morning, Walter Emet was no more. His mother was sent for, but before- she could reach him, he breathed the last deep sigh. Reader, if you would look upon the scene which now opens, behold a fond mother, with snowy locks, seventy years of care are furrowed on her cheek, and she is drooping beneath the burden of life and misfortune, behold her approach, with trembling steps, the lifeless remains of her only son, the last solace of her declining years. She kneels by his side, and, with her withered hand, parts the locks upon his noble brow, and imparts the last kiss; that brow that nestled in her bosom in the helpless days of childhood, is now cold in death. She embalms it with her tears, and then, with palsied, faltering voice, says: "Farewell, Walter, for a few days, and then I will join you in the hidden world of spirits, where the destroyer will annoy us no more, forever!." Come, rum-seller, and look upon this scene, behold thy work! See the finishing stroke of thy hellish traffic! Thou hast crushed another noble heart! Thou hast extinguished another glowing intellect! The blood of another victim smokes upon thy altar! But you need not blush, you are authorized to murder, commissioned to set up public slaughter houses, and murder according to law. You support the gov- ernment, the constitution guaranties to you that right. The Supreme Court will not see you divested of that priceless heri- tage, purchased by the blood of the revolution, and bequeathed to you by the fatlers of your country.

Yes, rum-seller, come with me to the burial, come join the long procession, and follow   the lamented Emet to his silent home.  Come stand by his grave, and mingle with the mourn- ers, who weep over his untimely end-you too may weep, not because a mother's heart has been desolated, but because the career of thy victim was too short to swell thy coffers, and as the clods fall upon the coffin, again raise your voice and sing: "Hark from the tombs a doleful sound!

The rulers of the land owe you much gratitude for the dexterity with which thou hast prosecuted their edicts. Thou hast merited the plaudit: "Well done thou good and faithful servant." Walter Emet is gone, but Emma Clinton knows it not; yet she is sorrowful-sad presentiments and distressing dreams have hovered around her, since she bid him farewell. The night on which Emet died, Emma dreamed that she stood upon the brink of a burning lake, in the midst of a throng of heedless spectators, through which was stalking hideous forms, selecting victims and plunging them into the fiery gulf. The crowd stood unmoved and saw their dearest friends struggling in an awful death. At length she saw Walter Emet in the arms of a monster, who bore him to the verge of the lake, and plunged him beneath the scathing tide. The agony of her dream was intense. The chain which Emet had given her was around her neck. Some how she caught her right fore finger in the ring, and severed it from the links, and when she waked it was on her finger, without her knowing how it came there, nor did she ever know, but the supposition is as above stated. Emet had promised to write to her as soon as he reached Oxford. Two weeks rolled by and no letter came.  The wedding day was drawing nigh; two days more have passed, and the time for his return is up. The next day a Worcester paper came to the post office of the village, in which was the announcement of Walter Emet's death. The whole village was in mourning, for Walter Emet had a home in the affections of   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.       85 the people, but the news was kept from Emma, and plausible rumors were fabricated to justify his delay. Emma languished, confined herself to the solitude of her own room, refused to take nourishment, and, grieved incessant- ly. She knew that the spirit of Walter Emet had gone to join the long march of eternity. How she knew it was never known. Emma smiled no more-deep solemnity sat upon her countenance-her heart was in the grave. The sun of. her earthly hopes had gone down, and the deep, dark gloom of despair had gathered around her. The love that Emma Clin- ton cherished for Walter Emet was the pure love of the soul, not that momentary flash, the offspring of an idle hour, which rushes its mad victims to the altar, then leaves them to waste their lives amid the rankling elements of discord; but that deep and holy love which unites kindred spirits forever. Emma Clinton was in the grave, although life beat its num- bers in her breast, no thrill of joy was awakened. The chords of the heart were broken, and its music was forever still. Friends gathered around her to rally her back to life, but their efforts were unavailing. Emma loved them, but her hopes were in the tomb. She had no power to shake off the spell that bound her. Her parents wept around her pillow, but resistless fate was hurrying her from them forever. Now burning fever was on h@ brow, her lips were scorched with its heat, her breathing was hurried, and her pulse was rapid. It was evident to all that Emma Clinton would soon pass the dim vale of mortality. A few days passed, and Emma was still de- clining. The day appointed for her wedding had come-a time long looked for by the whole village, as a day of happy greeting and pleasant association. The evening was beautiful, not a cloud was in the sky. Emma was worse, but for a few hours she had been calm, her afflicted father and mother were sitting by her bed; Emma opened her eyes, and turning to her father, said: "Father, go summons my friends to the wedding, the time is hastening, I will be ready to meet the bridegroom at the appointed hour."     THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. Mr. Clinton thought her mind was wandering, but knowing that she must soon die, he sent for her most intimate friends. Soon they were around her bed.      Emma, turning her eyes upon thom, said: 'Dear loved ones, you have come to weep over me; I would not have you weep-you may weep over the wrongs of the world, beneath whose heavy hand I am now sinking into the grave; go weep over the ruins of rum, by whose hand my belov- ed has fallen.  Go weep over the rum-seller, whose murderous hand is bathed in the blood of innocence. Go weep over our government, for tolerating haunts of vice and iniquity, to be- guile your loved ones to death and misery." She turned from the conversation to the following poetry, addressing it to Walter Emet: "Life of my life, O! thou hast gone, Far, far beyond these distant spheres, And I can never tread alone, A weary solitude of years. On me the sky, the air, the earth, Their blended powers vainly shed, For I can know no second birth, Life of my life, since thou art dead. Where thou hast gone to, I must go, For here no promised pleasures bloom; All, all is pain and tears below; My hopes dwell only in the tomb. Yes, it is now our wedding hour, The time for our union is come; Soon death will lend its mystic power- I '11 join you in your spirit home." About the hour that she was to be joined to Walter Emet, in wedlock, she united with him forever in the changeless world of spirits. There, Emma, thou shalt meet thy loved one.  There you shall dwell, together, in bonds of unbroken affection, and unmingled felicity, to be separated no more, "never more." S9   CHIAPTER VIII. Mr. Worthington, whom we left in Jersey City, we now find in the West, prosecuting his search for Alice. Whilst the clouds of mystery gather thicker around the his- tory of Alice, Worthington becomes more impetuous in his mission, more determined to reach the goal of his ambition, and his feelings become more and more embittered at intem- perance, as each day adds to his experience the enormity of its ruin. Traveling through the inland country was then principally performed in stage-coaches, or mud-wagons; and grog-shops were then called taverns. Rum-selling literature had not then progressed to the gigantic desideratum  of the fascinating saloon. A number of classical gentlemen have recently con- tributed to the parlance of that peculiar fraternity, which I trust will abundantly supply the future. If an Irishman en- quires for a "jager mell," you know what he's after. If a German asks for "dier shnbpsnmoekher," you immediately comprehend his meaning. If a learned gentleman requests you to direct him to a "table d' hote," you instinctively point him to a rum-shop. If in the mixed crowd you hear one fel- low talking about a "juice-pen," another about a "fuzzle-pen," and another about a "gobble-shop," a "slobber-lick," a "snort- hole," etc., a rum-shop irresistibly rises before you.  The public mind seems to be very fastidious, of late, with reference to the name of, I suppose I will have to say peculiar institu-     88       THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. tion, as it is not a domestic institution, according to the late exposition of squatter-sovereignty. At Cincinnati, Mr. Worthington, in company with a friend, went to visit a family on Western Row, which was said to be in a wretched condition. They knocked at the door and got no answer, thinking that they heard a noise within, they con- tinued to knock, but could get no answer. They turned to leave the place, when a constable arrived with a writ of eject- ment. "He forced the door open," said Mr. Worthington, "and a scene which no language can paint was before us. There lay a father and a mother, and two small children, all drunk, and wallowing in their own filth. The father was so stupid that he could not be aroused. When the officer approached the mother, she uttered horrid oaths, struck at him, and fell back upon the floor. The children were fighting for an old coffee- pot containing a small amount of whisky, which they were- sucking, by turns, from the spout. There was not a spark of fire or a morsel of nourishment about the house. Neither was there furniture, beds or clothing. They had locked themselves up to die in this wretched abode. The officer stood motion- less, gazing upon them for some moments. I saw the tears starting down his cheek. "'My God,' he at length said,: 'this is the darkest picture of human misery that I ever looked upon. I devoutly wish there was not a drop of cursed whisky on God's footstool. Can I turn these poor creatures into the street? No, I never can.' Then he gathered the coffee-pot, and an old jug, which also contained whisky, and hurled them into the street. "'They tell me,' he continued, 'that whisky is good in its place. So I think; but that is its place, on the barren high- way, where it shall be trampled under foot, where it cannot wither the flowers of God's beautiful earth. They tell me that the moderate use of ardent spirits contributes to the health and happiness of the human family. I ask its votaries to point me to its triumphs; to tell me to whose withered cheek it has brought the smiling blush of health; whose life   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.       89 it has prolonged; who it has ever made better or happier. I can find none who can point me to the monuments of its fame. But the tombs of its victims rise up all around me. Suppose it does contribute to the momentary enjoyment of a morbid appetite, to the transient bliss of our animal nature, does it expand the mind, refine the morals, or swell the soul with heavenward aspiration? Does it not vitiate the sentiments and feelings of our nobler nature?' "By this time a large crowd had gathered to the room. "'Behold,' said the officer, 'the scene before you. There lie the pride of manhood, the charms of woman, a father's love, a mother's tender care, and the angelic smiles of infancy, buried in the loathsome grave of intemperance. There lie the dilapida- ted remains, the blasted remains of an unfortunate brother man; divested of fortune, character, virtue, mind, and hope. He was once a temperate drinker, took his sociol glass and boast- ed of his power to control the burning appetite. Once he would have scorned you, had you pointed him to the depths to which he was hurrying; but rum has now finished upon him its fiery detail. He bent beneath its force, he was shivered by its blow, as the forest bends before the storm, and the oak is rent by the lightning's touch. You call this intemperance; I call it the last stage of dram-drinking, that insidious disease from which so few ever recover, by which thirty thousand of our citizens fall annually. Yes, 'wine is a mocker, and he that is deceived thereby is not wise." "'Yes,' said Doctor D  , the gentleman who accompa- nied Worthington, 'fathers, look upon your children, behold the awful danger to which they stand exposed. The fond ones that you now so tenderly press to your bosom may fall by the hand of the fell destroyer when you are no more. You seem to think not, you seem not to be alarmed; are not these poor creatures the children of fond parents? Are not your children made of the same frail elements? Is not the /ruiner still abroad in the land, still stalking at large in our midst? Will not the same cause produce the same effect, under the same circumstances? Will you not rise in your     90       THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. sovereign power, and put the vile monsters under your feet? There is no safety for your children, in a land of grog-shops.' 'This miserable family,' said the officer, 'must be taken to the poor-house. The rum-seller has finished his work'upon them, he has made them homeless, friendless, penniless, clotheless, and breadless. He now magnanimously bequeathes them to the government to feed and clothe. That which he has stolen from them, must now be refunded from the pockets of the people.'" Mr. Worthington turned away from this scene with an over- whelning conviction that grog-shops are the bitterest foes of humanity, and common enemies of the public peace, and that a rum-seller is little else than a licensed highwayman, a plun- derer of the public treasury. It was Saturday evening, the close of a lovely day in au- tumn, when Worthington stepped from the stage, in the village of L   , and entered The Traveler's Home, to rest over Sabbath. There he was not long in forming some acquain- tances. A mile from the village, camp-meeting was in pro- gress, to which Worthington started immediately after supper, in company with a Mr. Watters. "There might be some satisfaction in going to meeting," said Watters, "if the rum-sellers were all hanged, or in the penitentiary. Last night they broke up the services, and to- night they will attempt the same thing again. I wish no one any harm, but since the laws of the land will not protect the sanctuary, I do wish, from the bottom of my heart, that some power would strike these ruffians to the earth the moment they interfere with the worship of God's people." "I can most heartily join you in your opposition to rum- selling," said Worthington; "but pray tell me what has excit- ed the ire and indignation of that peculiar brotherhood, in this locality." "Do you see," said Watters, ."that old hut upon the side of yonder hill? There was once the home of a family of their victims. Two years since the old man froze to death between the grog-shop and home. Last summer, one of his two sons,   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.       91 was burned up in a still-house, where, for several days, he had been lying drunk. A few days before the commencement of this meeting, the other son took home with him two flasks of gin. His mother swore that she would have one of them; he swore that she should not, out of which grew quite a quarrel. At length, the young man said, that if lie 'had a rope he would hang himself.' Whereupon, his mother cut the cord from her bed, and handing it to him, said, 'hang yourself and be-d-d.' In two hours she was informed that her son had carried his threats into execution. She swore she was glad of it, and that she hoped he was now in hell. She hastened to where he was hanging, pulled the flasks from his pockets, and drank from them till she was dead drunk. Yesterday the minister alluded to the circumstance, nailed the crime to the rum-seller, whom he held up to the gaze of the crowd, naked and deformed, with Murderer and Pickpocket branded upon his brow, in letters of burning shame. At this they become highly incensed, and swore they would whip the preachers and break up the meeting." By this time the camp-ground was in view; dusky twilight had folded its mantle around the scene. The tents were lightened-torches were burning brightly upon the fire-stands, and the air was filled with the voice of singing. A large crowd was on the ground, and noisey, threatening groups were gathered around the whisky-tents. "Worthington and his companion approached one of them. They were mocking the services of God's sanctuary; they were passing around a tincup full of whisky, in derision of the sacrament of the Lord's supper. An anxious seat was set out, and two bloats kneeled before it and feigned penitence. The crowd gathered around them and sang "'The muley bull fell down the hill, Oh! halle, hallelujah, It's ten to one if he ain't killed, O! halle, hallelujah.' "And when the trumpet blowed at the stand, to announce the hour of worship, one of the mockers exclaimed, 'there,     92        THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. by God, there's Gabe's trumpet, wake snakes, and come to judgment.'" "'My God,' said Mr. Watters, 'what can reduce men to such degradation as this, such daring profanity, but rum.' 'Rum, said Worthington, 'is the unrivaled scourge of our fallen race.'  When our friends reached the inclosure, the seats were crowded, and the aisles were full of standing spectators.- Many had come to see the result of the rum-seller's threat. Soon the preacher arose; he was dressed in a straight breasted drab coat; gray locks clustered around his brow, and his venerable form trembled beneath the pressure of age. Wor- thington recognized him, He was the revolutionary father with whom he had met on the steamer Troy, who made the captain land him upon the banks of the Hudson. "God bless the old man," said a hundred voices. "Amen," responded Worthington. "I am a stranger among you," said the old man. "I have never seen you before, perhaps I will never see you again; more than a half century ago I passed with a little band of revohitiAory soldiers, along the path that winds around the foot of this hill. I am the last of that band; my companions sleep in the grave. I am surrounded by an- other generation. Let us sing." "Angels our march oppose, Who still in strength excel, Our secrets, sworn, eternal foes, Countless, invisible; From thrones of glory driven, By flaming vengeance hurl'd, They throng the air, and darken heaven, And rule this lower world. * ,   X    *X  After singing and prayer, the old gentlemen again rose, and pulling a paper from his pocket, said: "Here is a letter ad- dressed to the preachers at this meeting. I will read it: "'To the Presiding Elder and Preachers at this meeting:- You are hereby notified, that we, the respectable citizens of this vicinity, will have no more of your temperance prating.   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.       93 We are tired of political preaching. We will, no more submit to the abuse of traveling vagabonds. We will not have odium heaped upon our character for exercising a privilege guaran- teed to us by the constitution, and the wise provisions of our statute. You live off the people-we pay our license money into the treasury, and it goes to support this government. Disregard this notice and your altar shall be torn from beneath your feet, and your clerical robes shall be exchanged for coats of tar and feathers; which we have every reason to believe will restrain your impudence in the future, if it does not re- store you to a sense of your duty.' "Who wrote this letter?" said the old man, "rise to your feet that I may look upon you, cowards; why did you not fix your signature to it? so that your names might be enrolled upon the scroll of eternal infamy, and serve as odious epithets to provoke the wrath of Demons. "This note was found upon this desk this evening, and it shall furnish me a theme for this hour. I have lived a long life of hardship and danger, ever battling with the enemies of God, and my country. I have never compromised with either at the sacrifice of principle. In the worship of Almighty God, none have ever dared to molest me, or presumed to make me afraid. It is now too late to attempt to swerve me from my steadfast moorings by the cowardly threats of a band of rum-sellers. It is too late for them to dic- tate to me, the terms upon which I may occupy the sacred desk. Yes, rum-seller, I know that you would fain silence the ministry from preaching that gospel, which pro- nounces a curse upon those who hold the cup to their neigh- bor' s lips. "I know that you would fain smother the fire of indignation, that is kindling in the hearts of the people at your unhallowed traffic. But you might as well try to silence the troubled ocean amid the raging storm;-you might as well try to smother in the heavens, the lamps that illuminate our globe.- You are fighting against God. The triumph of right is the immutable decree of Jehovah. The march of eternal truth is     THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. onward. You are too feeble to contend with Omnipotence.- Go, my brother ministers, as Christ has commanded you, into all the world and preach the gospel-the whole gospel. Go like Paul, and reason with mankind, of righteousness, temper- ance and judgment to come, and the rum-sellers, like Felix, will tremblelefore you. - 'How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things.' 'Therefore, seeing that we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not. But we have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.' Yes, brethren, be ever at your post, be not traitorous sentinels upon the watch-tower of Zion.- Cease not to combat vice of every character, wherever found, in high places or low. Many a night have I preached by the camp-fire in the wilderness, against oppression and the popular vices of the day., I was not then called a traveling vagabond; that was not called political preaching by any but the Tories. God have mercy on the little mind by which these ideas were conceived. Have you ever viewed with a microscope, an atom of matter poised between two repulsive forces, each holding it an equal distance, it having no power to rise, and being to light to fall ? If you have not, you have no adequate conception of these little souls, who are so anxious to silence the ministry. When, the minister ceases to expose the vices that are luxuriating around him,-when he ceases to be a champion of truth, and a votary of humanity and justice, he ceases to be a minister of God, and becomes the subservient tool of iniquity-the crouching, cowering slave of demagogues, and the weather-cock of the popular breeze. God save my country from such a ministry! I am among the last of the com- panions of Washington-of him whose prayer was, God bless my country; make it the temple of liberty, the sanctum of Godliness, and the home of every noble virtue. Of him who said in his farewell address, that of 'all the habits and dispo- sitions which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality    THE ISCROLL AND LOCKET.             95 are indispensable supports.' Do grog-shops strengthen these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens ? Does our country turn to them for anything but to scorn them for the misery and death which they produce ? Are they not the prolific progenitors of every species of vice and immorality; of every crime that degrades the body or ruins the soul ? Do they not consign one hundred and fifty thousand to jails and prisons annually? Do they not instigate the commission of fifteen hundred mur- deers? Do.'they not cause two thousand suicides? Do they not destroy thirty thousand lives ? Do they not make twenty thousand widows, and one hundred thousand orphans? Do they not produce one hundred maniacs?  Do they not steal more than one hundred millions of dollars from the pocket of the people ? All within the brief space of one year. Does not each year present the same dark record? With these startling facts before us, we are commanded to be silent.- We are commanded to be mute while the floods of sin and ruin rise around the sanctuary,-while the shades of desolation darken around our hearths and homes. We will not be silent. Your threats, rum-sellers, fall harmless at our feet; I scorn those who would bridle my tongue, and fetter my thoughts.- Tear this altar from beneath my feet; execute your threats upon me; To my latest breath I will proclaim the whole counsel of the Lord, and when my tongue is silent in death, ten thousand tongues will awaken to swell the theme. The temperance cause cannot be trampled under feet, it has the sanction of conscience and the approval of reason. The future will rise up as its champion. Government is instituted for the peace, safety, and well being of the people. Your traffic is at war with these. The time is hasteing when it will no longer be tolerated; reason will assert her umpirage.- When the grass grows green over my grave, the votaries of temperance shall triumph. God speed the happy day, and save our children from the ruin of the dram-shop. God hasten the day that shall wipe from our country's escutcheon, the foul blot of licensed iniquity. Ours is a christian land, as our    96       THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. stars and stripes float out upon the seas displaying, to the gaze of every nation, the ensign of liberty. With it goes our Missionaries and our Bibles, to proclaim to a benighted world, salvation's opened fountain. Our pilgrim fathers dedicated this land to God and liberty. Then let our acts be consistent with our profession. Whilst we teach, let us be an example; let the laws of our land be a model for the imitation of others. So that we may extend the empire of freedom, and the glory of God. To be great, we must be good. The mournful his- tory of the past will point you to the fate of nations which have worshiped at the shrine of luxury and intemperance; that have trampled the laws of God under their feet. Ruin has ever followed in the footsteps of vice, and will to the end of time. The shades of death are gathering around me; I speak to you from the grave. Receive my admonition. Be temperate. Touch not, taste not, handle not. 'Why do you spend your money for that which is not bread 7 and your labor for that which satisfieth not?' The truth is engraven upon our nature, that we caniht tamper with the bowl with im- punity; turn not a deaf ear to the ceaseless warnings of eternal truth. 'The Lord spake unto Aaron, saying, do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.' Iere is a statue from him whose wisdom rules and governs with unjarring harmony, the countless worlds which are around us-from lim who formed this mysterious association of mind and matter, of soul and body; by which we are made inhabitants of time and eternity. Will you yield to be gov- erned by it? Will you respond to the requirements of an unerring God? If you will, the mind will rule the body, and you will ascend higher in the scale of the intellectual being; you will proximate closer the image of your divine Creator. If you will not, the body will rule the mind; you will sink from the man to the brute, and become a loathsome slave of appetite and passion. O! God help us to be men."   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.       97 I will now present to you the Saviour of'the world. When the old veteran approached this part of his subject, his soul seemed to catch new fire. The congregation melted to tears; the fire of reformation caught; the power of God came down; sinners were convicted; saints rejoiced, and many of those who had went to usurp Gods altar, and desolate his beautiful sanctu- ary plead for mercy. That camp-meeting revolutionized the sentiment of that neighborhood, and made it as famous for piety, as it had been hitherto infamous by its profanity aid intem- perance; and when it closed there were but few left to advo- cate the cause of rum and ruin. "I go from this meeting a better man," said Mr. Watters, as he and Worthington turned towabd the village. "God has given his people the victory," replied Worthing- ton; the consistent votaries of truth and Godliness are irre- sistable. If we were all as consistent with our profession, as that old man, and as zealous in our devotion to right, budding virtue and expanding truth would blossom and spread, science and religion would light up the wilderness and waste places of the earth, to the march of our progress. The nations of the world would hail us in our flight, and worship with us, at the common altar of humanity and religion 7 . ' $     I   0 O HAPTIR IX. ' f    '! One year has passed, since we parted with Worthington at the village of L----. To him it has been a year of unre- mitting toil, and restless anxiety, a wearisome year of care and unavailing search. The sad fate of Walter Emet and Emma Clinton, which came to him through the papers, contri- buted to the oppression f his feelings. His overtaxed ener- gies have drooped beFath their burden. The deep ocean of dispair has rolled over his hopes. Alice cannot be found. Again he is in the City of New York, walking its streets like a troubled spectre, with pale and hollow cheeks, buried in abstraction, lost in the intricate maze of conflicting emo- tions. Little James, too, is gone, he has disappeared, he can hear nothing of him. It seemed to him that life had lost its reality-that he had taken up his existence in the world of dreams. He had done all he could do, to consummate the wishes of the the dying mother-he had paid his solemn vow. When he dispaired of finding Alice, he had a plain marble monument placed over her mother's grave, on which he had inscribed the following epitaph: C4MY WOTHER'S GRAVE. ALICE." In the pedestal of the monument he had a receptacle pre- pared, and in it deposited the sealed scroll, that the secrets I    THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.       99 therein, might sleep forever over the dust of ,that troubled one by whom they were committed to his keeping. "I have called," said Worthington, to one who had been the friend and companion of his earlier and happier days, "to bid you farewell; to-morrow I shall turn my back upon the City; I, in all probability will never return; by this time to- morrow evening I shall be rocking on the ocean owaves, im- ploring the God of the winds to bear me away from the scenes of my troubles and disappointments. Where I shall go I cannot tell-I care not," "No, Worthington," was the reply, "I cannot say farewell to one whom I have loved so long, you must not go,-your friends are, already, troubled at your wearisome stay. I can- not tell them when I return, that Worthington is gone. You must accompany me home, and, again with me, re-visit the scenes of childhood's happy, sportive hours. There you will shake off your melancholy, and the sunshine of brighter prospects will gleam around you. Bills are up announcing the meeting of a new temperance organization to-night, called the Washingtonians. John Hawkins, a reformed drunkard, is to speak, and other reformed druhkards are to relate their experience. This will be new and interesting; I am anxious to go; you will not refuse me the pleasure of your com- pany." "I will comply with the last specification of your request, but I can promise no further," said Worthington, and in a half hour he and his friend were seated in the City Hall, the spacious apartment of which was crowded with excited specta- tors. The members of the society, consisting of two hundred reformed inebriates, were seated together in front. All eyes were fixed upon them. At seven o'clock the President of the Society rose and introduced to the audience, John Hawkins, of Baltimore. Mr. Hawkins said: "Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:-To-night I have a hope within me-a hope which sober moments alone could inspire-a hope that I shall yet elude the wilds of the fiery demon-escape from rny bondage, and return to my native     100       TRE SCROLL AND LOCKET. manhood. This is a priceless hope to me; the world has no wealth so dear. This hope is my only treasure. It alone points me to days of tranquillity on earth, and bliss beyond the grave.            / "Shall this hope be realized? Shall I maintain my inde- pendence? Shall I be a freeman in the land of the free?- Do you sympathize with the oppressed? Do you love to break the fetters that bind the unwilling slave? If you do, look upon me, and this little band around me, who have spent a life of cruel servitude in your midst, who are now struggling to be free. Will you lend a helping hand? Will you rise against our oppressor? Will you help us battle with our ene- mies? ^ Will you cease to license rum-shops? Will you cease to tolerate that traffic by which we have fallen? Will you lend us the aid of your example? If you will not, tell me no more, that you love the poor drunkard-that you love his heart-broken wife, and ragged, starving children. Tell me no more that you are a votary at the shrine of humanity-that you are a friend of temperance-that you pray for the sup- pression of crime and misery in the land, and for the triumph of Christianity. Our caus'e is the cause of the ruined; we come to plead it before the tribunal of public sentiment.- "ead us not into temptation,' is the prayer taught to us by the Saviour of the world. To you we offer the same prayer. We beseech you to led us not into temptation, by strewing the land with grog-shops; you tell us that you want us saved from their ruin, but that we must save ourselves. So would you say to the naked and destitute, 'depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled,' but yet contribute nothing to their relief. Remember that the unfortunate inebriate has within him a mor- bid appetite, a burning thirst, which he has but little power to control, when the temptation is before him. This appetite is not always the creature of his own creation. Often he inherits it from drunken parents, and many of us have planted it deep in our childen. We ask you to save us and our children.- Will you not do it? Will you not throw around us the pro- tection of the law? Does the public good require the tolera-   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.       101 tion of grog-shops? Do they contribute in the least, to the happiness and well-being of society? Answer this question with the judgment and eternity before you. Remember that you are all responsible for the evils of these institutions.- * They are the creatures of law, brought into existence by the legislators whom you elected; their acts are your acts, and the evils which result therefrom, are chargeable to you, and N God will reckon them against you in the great day of accounts. Up yonder is the higher court before whose tribunal we must all appear, and before whose judge life's hurried moments are bearing us on. Can you stand acquitted before eternal jus- tice while the iniquity which you have sanctioned, swells the hosts of the damned? You license the rum-seller to blight and curse the souls of men, in sight and hearing of the sanctuary, where the minister toils out his life for the salvation of sin- ners. Let me beseech you to be no longer blind to consisten- cy. Turn not a deaf ear to the cries of the suffering and the ruined. Is there nothing in the scene before you to move your compassion? Remove the rum-shops from around us, and we are safe. We once had happy homes and loved ones around us, now our property is scattered to the wind, and our loved ones, some of them sleep in the grave-some of them are homeless wanderers in the world. Remove the temptal- tions. Shut up the grog-shops, and we will gather up the relics of our scattered flocks, and go out to battle with the world anew." Mr. Hawkins then related part of his own experience in intemperance. The depth of degredation to which it had brought him, and the sorrow and affliction that it had heaped upon his loving family. The tears flowed in streams from his cheeks, and at times grief chocked his utterance. There were few in the vast audience who did not weep. When 2Mr. H. took his seat, others rose and swelled the testimony against rum-shops, until there was not left the shadow of an argu- ment for their toleration. "My. God, the evils of intemperance have never half been told,' was articulated all over the house. At the close of the     102      THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. meeting a tall, dignified gentlemen rose, and asked permission of the President to say a few words, which was granted. "I rise," said he, "to relate some strong and afflicting occur- ces which have come under my observation within the last four months. In June I was returning from Liverpool, on an American vessal, the name of which I now forbear to mention. Soon my attention was directed to a sorrowful and sickly looking little boy, who performed various waiting offices on the vessel. At length I missed him entirely, and was at a loss to know what had befallen him. One morning I awoke at four o'clock, and walked out upon the quarter-deck to look on the moonlight ocean scenes, where my ear soon caught the the mournings of a little sufferer. I aproached the sound, and it was the last expressions of the earthly grief of that littly boy. His mind was wandering. 'Yes,' said he, 'mother, I will soon come. Will father be sober there? Is little Willie with you? Will Alice and Laura come? Will we all meet in heaven, mother?' I aroused him and he was rational, and said. 'I have come up here to die, where I can breathe the fresh air, and see the moon and beautiful stars. Here I scan look up to where God is; mother is up there, and I want to die and go there too.' I asked him his name. 'James Lovel,' he whispered, faintly. I asked him questions relative to his history, but he was too weak to answer them. At sunrise we buried the little emaciated body deep in a watery grave. Not long since, I had business in Ohio and Indiana. I stopped to spend a few days at Niagura Falls, it being on my route.- There I met hundreds of visitors from different parts of the world, among whom there were none who attracted so much attention, as a beautiful Maniac girl. She was one of the sweetest singers that ever chanted a lay. The night before I left she disappeared. On a piece of paper that was found in her room, was written: 'My name is Laura Lovel. Father is a drunkard; I am going to see Willie; I am going to sleep in the sublimest grave on earth; in the whirling eddies beneath the mad cataract, and its ceasless roar, shall be my funeral requiem.'   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.      103 "Three weeks after this I stopped to spend a Sab- bath in a western town; a gentleman with whom I had business, by the name of Wayland, was upon his death bed. I called to see him, and he seemed to be much distressed n mind; on Sabbath evening it was announced by his Physi- cian, that he could not last till morning, About midnight his friends were called around his bed to see him die; after he had struggled a while, apparently, in the arms of death, he opened his eyes and said: 'I cannot die till I see Alice Lovel.' X I heard of the circumstance and hastened to his room. Alice Lovel was sent for immediately. I was there when she ar- rived. I have never looked upon one more beautiful, notwith- standing she was pale, and wore the marks of care. 'Alice Lovel,' said the dying man, 'you are the only one whom I have ever wilfully injured. My mind suffered a severe shock at your refusal to love me. I have never been myself since. I could not have been rational, or I never could have consented to interfere with your letters; were I as pure as you, Alice, I could die happy. Through your letters I have heaped sorrow upon you. I have every reasen to believe that your father is a reformed man, and yet alive. I have no relatives now alive to heir my property. I have left it to you. Will you forgive me? 'I will,' said Alice. 'God has taught us to forgive, that we may be forgiven. The winds of adversity which have beaten upon me, have only driven me closer to heaven. All that has happened may be designed for my good.' "Behind a frowning providence, God shows his smiling face." "'Now,' replied Wayland, 'I am ready to leave this world. I could not die with this burden upon my soul; kneel beside my bed, Alice, and offer my spirit up to God. I will try and catch the wings of faith, and fly away and be at rest.' "'While Alice was yet praying, Wayland launched out upon the shoreless ocean of eternity. Strange as it may seem to you, Alice, Laura, and James, were all children of the same parents. All of them were nourished out of the same fond mother's breast-scattered and murdered by the foul and bloody hands of the rum-seller, in a land of bibles and sanc- c .                        .     104       THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. f tuaries, where the sound of the gospel mingles with the mur- mur of every rippling stream, under the open sanction of our laws, the boast of which is to give equal protection to all.- May God, shut up the rum-shops-smother the fires of the distillery, and remove from our favored land the foul, deep, dark stain of intemperance." "Amen," responded many voices. During the recital of this mnysterious coincidence, no sound disturbed the death-like still- ness, except the occasional sob of some overburdened heart. Af- ter the gentleman took his seat, all was silence for some minutes, at length a trembling form arose, his cheeks were bathed in tears, and the deep ocean of feeling was heaving its waves in his breast; every eye was turned upon him. It was some time before his tongue would give utterance. At length he said, in broken accents, "these were my children!" and sunk back into his seat. None who were present at that meeting, will ever forget its closing scene. Some rose with clinched fist, and openly cursed the rum-seller. Some wept over their ruin. Others went off with their brows knit with firm resolve to battle against the traffic. Worthington requested the Secretary of Society, to hand to Mr. Lovel the following card: \MR bi:I "New York, Nov. the 8th, 1840. "MR. L   VEL.-Sir:-If it will be compatible with your arrangements, Charles Worthington will be happy to see you to-morrow at two o'clock, at No. fifty-three, City Hotel."' A change had come over Worthington, the developments of that meeting had turned the tide of his feelings. He re- marked to a friend on their return: "This night has solved the deepest mystery in the realities of human life. This night has been a harbinger of peace to my mind. The current of the stream, upon whose brink I was standing, is changed by the drifting sand." The next day Worthington opened the locket containing the picture of Alice, and hung it up in his room, where it could not fail to catch the attention of Mr. Lovel. By this experiment I   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.       105 he could test the reality of what had transpired; if it was the likeness of his daughter, he would immediately recognize her features. A few minutes before two o'clock, Worthington and Lovel stood face to face. "I am here in obedience to your request," said Lovel. "I hope you will excuse me for the liberty I have taken," said Worthington. "I was informed last night, that you had been fraudulently /   dispossessed of your property. Will you accept, as a gift, a small amount of money, for your present relief? that you will yet recover your property I have but little doubt' "Generous stranger," said Level. "I receive your gift with more gratitude than I have words to express. Your unaffected kindness falls like rays of sun- shine, through the thick clouds that hang around my overbur- dened heart. The time may come, however, in this ever- changing world, when I can bestow upon you some humble favor. Though I never expect to regain my property, the papers essential to its recovery are, I fear, forever lost. Gone like my companion and my children; gone like the golden moments which I have drowned in the bowl; gone to be re- called on earth no more." At this point the locket caught the view of Mr. Lovel; he gazed at it for some moments with motionless attention. "Stranger," at length, he said, "In that picture, I behold my only living child, my long lost-my darling Alice.- Where shall I go for an explanation of this bewildering scene?" "Follow me," said Wortington, and soon the two stood in silence before the tomb of Mrs. Level. Worthington, pointing to the grave, said, "There sleeps the companion of thy bosom, the mother of Alice Level. I saw her die, and received from her trembling hands that locket, to- gether with two scrolls of valuable papers, which I promised to preserve, and present to the person whose picture is therein contained; in search of whom, for eighteen months I have roamed the land, like a troubled spirit. I gave her up for     106      THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. lost, and deposited the papers within the pedestal of that monument." "Oh, stranger!" said Level, bursting into tears, "God will reward you for your kindness to the afflicted. The evil of in- temperance cannot be told on earth. Time is too short to paint its horrors; the human mind is too finite to grasp its limitless detail. The lucid tongues of infinite spirits could scarce recount its deeds of ruin: its sorrows are unbounded and fath- omless. Oh, rumseller, give me back my home! restore to me the jewels of my heart!"Then he leaned against the tomb, and gave way to a flood of grief. Worthington turned from the affecting scene, with glistening eyes, and walked, off, that he might not intrude upon the feel- ings of the mourner. When he looked'back, he saw a beau- tiful female form standing before the tomb. "My mothers's grave!" at length he heard her say. "Can this be my mother's grave?"Her voice startled Lovel. He stepped back, and stood some moments gazing upon her. "God bless you, Alice!" "' Oh, my father!" were the next sounds which greeted the ears of Worthington. Alice Lovel was folded in the arms of ler father, beside her mother's grave. She had just returned to the city, and was searching for the final resting place of her dearest earthly friend. There are many mysterious realities in life; many occur- rences daily transpiring before us, which human reason cannot explain. Thanks be to God, that our destiny is under the guidance of Unerring Wisdom. Worthington would not impose his presence upon Alice and her father on this sacred hour. As he turned from them, his heart beat quicker. He had seen Alice, and she was more than his wildest dreams had taught him. He looked down the stream of life, and beheld its smooth, gliding surface sparkling with bright and happy days, could he but win her heart. Next morning the return of Alice Lovel was announced in the pa- pers at considerable length, and the story of her miraculous adventures was the theme of every circle. The third day   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.      107 after her return, she and Worthington stood face to face. Their meeting, the presentation and reception of the locket, sealed scroll, and papers, was a touching scene; to describe which, would humble the proudest imagination and tame the wildest fancy. The sculptor can well-nigh impress the life- glowing feautures upon the marble, and the painter throw the shades and colors of a smile or a frown upon the canvass; but the heart and heaving bosom must speak for themselves. The workings of the human soul laugh to scorn the proudest effort of imitative art. Who can utter the language of a tear? the glancing eye? the rising blush? They are outward expres- sions of our immortal nature, unutterable by human tongue. The papers there presented turned poverty to fortune, brought homes to the homeless, and hope to hearts long op- pressed. Charles Lovel recovered his property, dispossessed up Simon Gouty, smothered the fires of his distillery, anid shut his rum-shops; at which reverse of fortune, Gouty committed suicide. Thank God, that his engines -f'ruin are silenced. He was the disgusting man with whom Worthington was housed in the stage-coach, on the morning he left his uncle's; the one who defrauded the poor Irishman; the one who murdered little Willie. He has gone to meet his reward in eternity. God have mercy on the rum-seller! The scroll there presented disclosed the startling fact that ALICE LOVEL WAS A RICH HEIRESS. This news fell upon the public .ear, like the voice of thunder from an unclouded sky. Soon the world came and paid to her its deceitful homage. Beauty, wealth, honor, and wit came and worshipped at her feet. Lovers came with rosy words, to beguile her and win her loving heart. But alas! Alice had no heart to give. Her heart beat in the bosom'of the generous Worthington: there it glowed with the quenchless fire of undying love. Two nobler hearts never beat in unison; two more congenial spirits never mingled. Before one year had passed Worthington and Alice stood before the ALTAR, and exchanged vows of eternal con- stancy. Since which they have labored together in love for the promotion of every cause which tends to make mankind     108       THE SCROLL AND LOCKET. better and happier. Their home is on the romantic Hudson, overlooking one of the loveliest prospects on earth. God bless them! -^          \ Now obtrusive age is stealing upon them, and the silent march of years is bearing them on to the last conflict; but their lives are blossoming afresh in the little group around them. Their noble virtues shall be handed down as a heritage to the distressed. In new life they smile again upon the dark path of misery and ruin, and again rekindle the light of hope in the hearts of the desolate and lonely. Charles Lovel still lives. -e is our kinsman Not a year has passed since we heard his trembling voice mingle with the choir around the family altar of Worthington and Alice. Twenty sober years have prepared his heart for a blissful immortality. Soon he will go to grasp the prize. We have bid him farewell on earth forever. Bitter feelings gathered around our heart when we stood upon the trembling verge of Niagara, and cast our eyes down among the shattered rocks, and beheld the angry waters foam- ing in boisterous fury over the grave of Laura Lovel. It is true, that is the sublimest grave on earth. Well might the Maniac of the Mound there choose to sleep in death. Tor- rents rushing upon torrents in wild confusion, leaping heedless and thoughtless down, down the dizzy summit, from the meas- ureless floods, are strikingly emblematical of the wreck of an immortal mind. Sleep on, our lost cousin! The ever-rolling stream will wear down the rocky barriers, and the roar of the cataract will be hushed in the quiet murmur of the rippling waters. Then will its spray cease to be thy shroud, but settle with the morning dew, and rise no more. Yes, sleep on! God has marked thy resting place; and when the dissolving earth shall fall to atoms, and the crush of worlds shall arouse ' i the human family from the long sleep of the grave, then He will bid thee rise, thy mind all glowing with immortal bright- :;:- .I ness,-and thy voice sweetd than the enchanting song of war-   THE SCROLL AND LOCKET.       109 bling birds, shall swell the blending harmony of the angelic choir. Then shall the sea give up its dead, and little James shall burst his ocean tomb, and join the family band, where rum shall ruin and separate no more. Oh! rum, we hate thee!  Thou hast wronged us much. Thou hast scattered our friends, and heaped sorrow upon our heart. Our mind is overburdened with the memories of thy ruin. Rum-seller, wherefore dost thou not blush with ever-burning shame at the deeds which thou hast perpetrated? Thy name is written in blood over the threshhold of every circle. Not a month has passed since two of thy victims, Anderson and Richards, hung together at Lancaster, who, being made drunk by thy nefarious traffic, murdered two innocent and helpless females, for twelve and a-half cents to buy a pint of whisky. Our heart sickens at thy darkening record, and we forbear to dilate upon the affecting theme.          i Friend of temperance, go on-despair not-truth is eternal and immutable. Thy cause shall survive the transient breath of thy deluded opponents. Be not allured from thy steadfast mooring upon the rock of principle, by the flickering light of faction. Yes, the temperance cause shall live while God has a sanctuary, humanity a votary, or virtue a home. THE END.
