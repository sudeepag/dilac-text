Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1873, by POTT, YOUNG & CO., In the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington.     CHAPTER I "ATHOLINDA DERWENT "-I signed my full, long, bar- barous name, and folded and directed the letter, with an inward anathema upon poor old Elsie for bestowing the unlucky cognomen upon my unoffending self. Then I read it over two or three times, to see that every i was properly dotted, and the tone sufficiently respectful, and ;-:  finding nothing to be gained by my oft-repeated perusals, uS - I directed and sealed it with as much solemnity as if I were sealing my destiny within its folds. And so I was; for it was directed to "John Graeme, Esq., Duval et cie., Paris," and testified that I, Atholinda Derwent, his ward and cousin, was ready and waiting, until such time as he should see fit to take her away from her dear old home, and place her at once among strangers in a strange land. What a lucky thing-no, I will alter that-what a prov- idential thing it is, that the young are so endued with a certain elasticity of spirits, a something between hope and fear, I think it is, that never shrinks, as in later years, from the uprooting of old -ties, but trustingly looking forward to the future, welcomes with delight any change. This was particularly the case with me.    8          ATHOL. The letter finished and dispatched, I threw myself on the stone bench by Elsie, and gave myself up to unlimited day dreams. Out toward the great new world, my desire bounded, and my heart throbbed exultingly, when I thought that in a few days, a week at farthest,j would spread my wings, like a long captive bird, and flee away to the home nestling in fair NIew England hills, and the love waiting for me. Then with the sudden impulse of a child, I remembered the dear old Lodge-now, alas! my home no longer-and Elsie's fond love and tender care; then at a bound contrasted it with the strange new faces and lack of love which might surround me. In these coming years I knew lurked many a lengthened shadow, dim and undefined, but slowly unfolding before me day by day, weaving with subtile changes the great web of the future. But whatever of evil lay before me, I would allow no shadow to darken my anticipations then. I was happy and blithesome as a bird all the live-long day; but sometimes, when I was alone, beneath all this careless happiness a great want would arise. A yearning wish to see some relative, some friend,--anything to rid myself of this irksome individuality; to merge my being into some happy household, where the names and faces bore some semblance to my own. To feel and know that in the hands I clasped, blood was coursing through the veins like unto mine. I wrestled with the wish until it grew strong within me, and my heart would not give up the thought, that on this broad earth a portion of my be- ing existed somewhere. I felt it must be so, and now, as the curtain was being lifted, as I stood upon the threshold, as it were, of a great new life, how fair and wide the sky Arched over the distant mountains, and how I longed to see what was beyond. The strong breeze swept down from the hills, and my cheek freshened at its familiar breath. I looked around.   --i -         ATHOL.           ( Below me rolled a vast uneven plain, steeped in alternate sunshine and shade. Smiling waters glinted among the waving green. t quiet hamlet or two spread at the foot of towering moun tain and beetling crag. An azure sky clasping a glitter ing horizon bounded the whole. I could not but feel thrill of pride within my heart, as my swift glance reste upon all the beauties of my home, for I was born, dea reader, in Scotland, amid the wild a'nd picturesque coun try of Rob Roy, and from babyhood my eyes had bee familiar with all the scenes which the enchanting romanc and poetry of Scott have thrown around the spot. Then remembering Elsie, I turned to where she sa knitting after her staid Scotch fashion in the porch. "Elsie, dear, I have written the letter." How well I remember the kind' old face, as she drop ped the flying needles, and meeting my fond look, gav me one equally as tender in return! "Aweel bairnie?" "I said I would go, nursie. How many days befor my guardian comes to take me away, think? I am tire of watching, Elsie dear. A good hour did I spend thi morning on the housetop, like sister Annie, and truly lik her, I have seen 'only a cloud of dust.'" "Dinna ye speak a goin' awa' yet lassie," she replied "It may be weeks before ye gang awa', he may wait fo yir bit letter. It's a lang way to that evil toun." "Even if he does wait," I answered, "it cannot tak so very long for the letter to reach him. He must ce: tainly be here next week, because you know, dear Elsie he was in such haste, and I cannot think, after all, he wi wait for any answer I might send him. He must know intend going. Indeed, dear nurse, what other alternativ is left me?" "Dinna speak o' goin' awa' yet tho' " said the ol    IO          ATIIOL. woman hastily, "my heart's sair fashed aboot it, puir win- some bairnie, they can neir luve ye like puir Elsie," and catching me to her heart she wept and crooned over me, with all the familiarity of an ancient and privileged Scotch servant. I lay there close in her sheltering arms; my brilliant hopes somewhat clouded by her sorrow and tears, and giv- ing kisses and embraces in return, bidding her with all a child's transient distress, remember how I never, never could forget her. That all the homes in America would not tempt me to leave her, if I could but stay. And lying there wrapped in her motherly arms, the dnly mother's embrace I had ever-known, I really felt all I expressed. 'o save her tears and sorrow, I believe I would then and there have given up trying to realize all the fairy castles my fancy had builded, and swept them away at once, leav- ing not a wreck behind. But it was not to be-all my short life I had been a waif on the stream of Time. Whither it was floating me I could not tell,-nor care. I was brought up from babyhood like children are in the fairy tales, only by my dear old nurse, instead of a wicked Queen and attendant Godmother, as is usually the case, and I also had none of their trials and discourage- ments. Elsie was always tender, true and uncomplaining; and although Derwent was just such a place as you and I and all other women, who have been children, read of, no fairy beneficiary or gallant Prince came to release me, until that letter arrived which I had just answered, and which had caused Elsie's burst of sorrow and my own transitory passion of tears. My mother died at my birth- my father six years after in a foreign land. I never saw his face, and had no reason to love his memory, for he left me a tender babe with no one, to care for me but old Elsie, and slight means of support for us both. Small as it was, however, I regularly received it through Mr. Craigie,   -^ 'ATHOL.            II my father's lawyer and tried friend. By the will of my great uncle, all my father's property, if he died without a son, reverted without reservation to a distant branch of his family, leaving me not only orphaned, but very nearly penniless. It was only through the kindness of the heir- at-law that Elsie and I were allowed to remain in our once grand home, until such time as my mother's relations would claim me. This was to be when I had attained my sixteenth birth-day, which important event in my life had been celebrated by the arrival of the letter in question. I knew nothing of my new friends, except that they were English, like my mother, and had removed to Amer- ica soon after her marriage. This marriage was against the consent of her properly appointed guardian, as well as the remonstrance of all her friends; and after her removal to Scotland, all intercourse had ceased, and a coldness, as of strangers, grew up be- tween them. Now long years had passed. Death had claimed wife and husband, and I was to be taken to their home and hearts as my mother had been before me. This was their wish, and my mother's last dying request. But un- til they claimed me I was alone in the world, saving Elsie and Mr. Craigie. He was an old and studious man, and so in the heart of these wild hills, shut out from other companionship, I turned to him, and under his careful direction a tolerable share of useful knowledge was im- planted in my brain. Books being my greatest source of amusement, I had eagerly devoured everything I could lay hands on, and a strange medley of curiosities in literature I had stored up against a future day of need. Nothing had happened in the course of those short, sixteen uneventful years to disturb me either mentally or physically. Derwent was rarely used by the wealthy heir- at-law, though occasionally parties of gentleman would come down during the shooting season, and then every-   12          ATHOL. thing was so uproariously gay that it frightened me into keeping closely by Elsie's side, and never by any chance ap- pearing until they had taken their departure. And so I lived, apparently forgotten by all, except for the occasional letters of business which Mr. Craigie received from Amer- ica, and which I'never saw or heard of except the merest mention of them by my taciturn old friend. But this last one, which had just arrived, was my very own-the first letter I had ever received, and was directed in due form, to "Miss Atholinda Derwent, of Derwent Lodge," making me feel for the moment quite a grand personage. It was a very concise, almost formal letter; but I liked it for that very peculiarity. The broad, heavy dashes of the pen, the hastily turned up g's and y's, the short terse sen- tences, pleased me at once. It seemed to me to fbre- shadow the character of the man with whom in the future I was to deal; and although I almost feared he might be cold and grave, and knew instinctively he was old, I yet answered it without a misgiving as to the result until moved by Elsie's tears. They were soon wiped away, and al- though I knew the sorrow only lurked dormant in her dear old heart for a time, I went on with my bright castle build-,. ang and she with her knitting, the rapid click of her 'needles scarcely keeping pace with my thoughts. I won- :.der if, in the after-life, when all our bad actions will be ;garnered up as so many accusing angels against us, whether my pure child-love for Elsie, lasting through so many years of my life, will not redeem many of my worst acts of commission and omission! But despite my love for her, I was young, and we long so keenly for change in youth, and I wanted home and love to surround me, and the protection of friends to shield me, as other young girls were shielded in the dawn of womanhood. All I needed to sum up the complete measure of my happiness was but to take Elsie with me, which, alas'! could not be. There-   S.4         A'ATIIOL.        13 fore, ardently as I longed for the journey, I was a little saddened and my brilliant hopes were somewhat damped by the reflection that while Elsie must be left behind in the gray and gloomy old Lodge, I was to go forward with my guardian alone to meet the great wide world whose por- tals were slowly opening to me, and upon whose thresh- old I yet lingered with a tumultuous, half-frightened thought of "What is the great world like?" CHAPTER II. WHAT a slow, long week it was, to be sure, that week in which I waited and watched for my guardian's coming. It was in vain to be tranquil about it. Again and again I climbed the dark staircases, and having gained the leads, looked down far out on the road and dreamed new dreams while I tarried impatient of my destiny. I had been con- tented all my life; but now that a new phase of existence lay before me, I was all anxiety to meet it. This restless- ness agitated me so that lessons were given up for the whole week. My trunks were packed and repacked, until at length wearied of the monotony, and having nothing more to do, I put on my hood, and, wrapping my plaid about me, took up my neglected books and started foi Mr. Craigie's. It was two miles away, on a lonely road and up a regular ascent. The ground was hard and drN and favorable to quick walking; the air keen and bra cing, with that peculiar elasticity which exhilarates men- tally and physically. I walked fast, until perfectly aglow with the healthful exercise. I reached his door two hour before sunset, said my lessons, received. my usual repri- mand for the past week's idleness, theh hastened home     "         ATHOL. ward with a light heart and step. Half way down the crag I stopped and looked up at the little solitary house where I had repeated my lessons so many years. It looked so gray and lonely in the gathering gloom that I said to myself, "Very likely I'll not see you again for some time to come, so I'll take a good look now." The whole rock was covered with soft moss, so I wrapped my plaid more closely around me and began daguerreotyping the scene on my heart for after years. I dwelt long and lovingly on every distinct feature of the familiar landscape; on the grand majestic mountains which climbed up steeply toward the skies, then rolled away melting in the blue distance like the great fixed waves of a tempestuous sea; on the loch, curling glassy and still beneath me; on the thick shadows and purpling golden, gleams the dying day was flinging over all; then up above me where the gaunt great pines were stretching their weird arms against the sky as if bearing on their hoary heads all the shocks a defied Heaven could hurl. Sometimes in our lives I think we find a place where we seem for the' mo- ment to stand face to face with God. I think if it is in any spot, it is where hill-top and heaven seem to meet. What a consciousness of boundless, inexhaustible existence it gives one! What a glimpse into the infinite and unseen! The woods around me grew darker and darker in the gathering gloom. No sound of human life floated on the clear air, and except the faint tinkle. of a bell from the distant herds, or the cry of a bird, wild and melancholy, starting a strange echo among the rocks, there seemed to be the impersonation and embodiment of silence resting on all. There was such a perfect hush of nature that it stilled every thought of my heart to perfect repose; like as of old, the tumultuous sea was calmed by the awful quiet of the Infinite voice which uttered, "Peace be still." And so these words seemed to fall down upon my own   wX^ .         ATHTIOL.       15 heart in contemplating this mighty repose; And a softened emotion crept into my vague revery. My thoughts, like white-winged birds, took flight, soaring away, far be- yond the cleft rocks and riven hills to where the blue sea circled and widened and where a new young world smiled up to Heaven, and the glad sun shone, and the white waves leaped to kiss the verdure-fringed shores; and out into dreamland I sailed, silly child that I was, and revelling in cloud and brightness, which only envelope the dreams of youth,1i forgot that the day had ended and the sun gone down leaving a rich evening sky. And with the slowly falling night my dream suddenly vanished and I started up, coming back to self with a quick, frightened remem- brance of being alone. No, not alone; for as I turned I came in full view of a man leaning carelessly against a rock. A horse with a loosened rein was grazing by his side. Both horse and master seemed lost in revery. Very possibly he was as struck with the beauty and quiet- ude of the scene as I, for his eyes were fixed on the dis- tant hills, and -he never noticed me as I passed along. He was a stranger, and that was an unusual thing to meet at this season of the year. What cloud had he dropped from? for it was but fair to-infer he had dropped from some cloud, as I had been there so long and he had not attracted my attention before. It is almost too late, I thought, with Elsie's notions of prudence, to stay in the vicinity of this stranger any longer, so I moved very quietly on. I had only gone a few rods when I was called back. His voice, clear and resonant, broke on the still air with a quick, musical intonation. "Not so fast, my little girl; your figure is needed to complete the landscape. Seated on that gray boulder, in hood and plaid, you ate quite a picture." He came strolling towards me, the bridle rein within his arm, while he was saying this, which quite alarmed *.     16   .'r HOT,. ATHOL. me, and I walked rapidly away. He saw at once I was frightened, for with a half-amused air he beckoned me to stop. "You were not in such haste ten minutes ago," he began, as he neared my side. "It is strange you did not see me. I have been watching and waiting for you ever since you came trip ping down the hill." "Waiting for me?" "Yes. I left Mr. Craigie's before you came.  I watched your coming, with your books under your arm, like a dainty, little Red Riding Hood, going to visit the bear, and I slipped out of the house to meet you here provided the bear did not eat you up, petite; and in that case I am afraid I should not have gone on to Der- went!! But suddenly changing his tone, he took both my hands in his, and two large, dark, kindly eyes, with real fire in their liquid depths, looked straight in mine while he uttered a "Surely he could not be mistaken in his little cousin?" I turned to him, happy. and beaming. It was my guardian, at last! My heart leaped up to give him a cor- dial greeting, but I could only utter a few inarticulate, relieved words of welcome. "So you were tired of the view after a few moments' look, were you?" he began, as we turned our steps slowly homeward. "Tired? indeed, no," I replied, "I could never tire of it; but it was getting late, and I should hurry home." "You are not in such haste now?" "Not since I discovered my company," I answered gayly. "It was strange I did not notice you before." "I saw you were blind with'meditation. Come,what were you puzzling your wise brain over?" "You, of course. I haven't had another thought for two weeks," I made answer with a laugh; for now that I   I           .  ATHOL.          17 had found him out, I was as delighted as I had been heretofore alarmed. "And did you think I, as your lawfully app6inted guardian, would approve of your venturing out alone and unprotected, after this fashion?" ( Yes, I wasn't afraid; beside, I wanted to see Mr. Craigie." "Ah! and what business so important have you and he been bothering your brains with?" "My usual lessons, you know, or rather you don't know; somewhat neglected of late; and then, I wanted to ask, when I might with certainty expect you. Elsie said you wouldn't come this week, but I wanted to know for certain." Well, and what comfort did Mr. Craigie give you? Any?" "Just as unsatisfactory as ever. Bade me go home and translate my Virgil." "Unsatisfactory, indeed," he returned laughing. "As an old bachelor he has an inveterate horror of Mother Eve and her descendants to this present day. I was there all the morning, and together we settled the formal- ities and technicalities of our law dealings; but I presume he wished to leave the unwelcome task of satisfying your curiosity to me alone. A very eccentric old gentleman, I should say, but not a bad specimen in spite of a few crotchets. Are you fond of him? Is he kind to you?" "If he had a daughter, I do not doubt she vould have been brought up precisely as I have. H -has stuffed me with Latin and Greek, exactly as many a pa- rent dispenses sugar-plums. When I am surfeited with such dainties, and long eagerly for excitement and change, a good long walk to D --, to church,-four miles if it is a step,-and a patient attendance upon a two hours'-in-length sermon, this is all the change he thinks I     IS         -ATHOL. require. Should the obstinacy of my sex lead me to de- sire more, I am only to read, ard profit by, St. Paul's ad- vice to women, contained more particularly, in the second chapter of his first epistle to Timothy." Mr. Grseme laughed. Unreservedly I joined him. We were already quite well acquainted. While we were talk- ing I glanced with, I need not say how much, interest at his face. The little I could see of it in the fading light, I liked. It was only the general outline, for it was rapidly growing dark; but his figure was tall and elegant, and his manner so kind and cordial, I felt at ease at once. "So my question is answered," he went on to say. "It is a bear, after all, the little Riding Hood visits,-a learned bear, a Latin and Greek, wise, woman-hating au- thoritative bear-poor little lassie! I wonder you did not suffer long ago the fate of your famous predecessor." "It was a wolf when I read it," I gravely corrected. He threw back his head and laughed, shrugging his shoulders. "You are very fond of the wolf, I see, and will grieve at leaving Derwent." "I did not say that." "But nearly the same thing when you gave me such a dolorous view of your amusements. What else have you to part with, beside Mr. Craigie and Derwent?" "Elsie, my dear old nurse. It will quite break her heart, although it has stared her in the face so many years." "The nurse? ah! I had forgotten, I declare. But why won't she go with you?  "Leave Derwent? Impossible-and her children? She would not for one instant think of such a thing." "Perhaps it is just as well," he repeated carelessly, switching'the grass with his long riding-whip. "I am cer- tain a world of love awaits you at Brookdell. And in a few months you will quite forget the parting." And then   'IS * .        ATHOL.          I1 he told me in a very pleasant way, how happy his sisters would be to see me. He had three. He was "Head of the Family," but not the eldest. His widowed sister, Mrs. Fleming, was many years older. The other two children were his father's by a second marriage, but very dear to him, he said. Harrie was about my age, perhaps a trifle older, and Alice nearly twenty. From the way in which he spoke of "Sister and Alice," I could see they were the presiding spirits of the place. The time passed so rapidly in talking over my anticipated journey (we were to start the next morning he said, early if I could), and the new friends I was soon to meet, that we reached the park gate before I was aware of it. It was so pleasant to walk with him by my side in the quiet light of that dying day, through the dry leaves and fading heather, that I was almost sorry when he held the wicket open for me to pass. I told him so as we went up the avenue, whereat he laughed, and said, I must be a romantic child to like walks with strangers in the gloamin'! But it was more ex- cusable than roaming around the country alone at that time of night, a thing he engaged I would not do when under his protection." And so we chatted until we reached the great stone porch, with its ponderous, oaken door, which I flung open, adding, as I did so, a few simple words of welcome, which I felt in duty bound to offer to this, my first guest. Then I led him through the dim old hall, silent but for our echoing footsteps, into the large dining-room which we rarely used except for company, but where Elsie had kept a blazing fire ever since we began to expect him. It was an antique room, with grand mullioned win- dows, emblazoned with the coat of arms, quarterings, and heraldic badges of the Derwents, centuries back. ,The walls were covered with ancient armor, grouped together after fanciful devices, and heavy old portraits of dead and  20          ATHOL. gone Derwents. I never took any interest in their lack- lustre faces, though Elsie did, and was forever pointing out my grandfather, and great-grandfather, and his grand- father before him. As if I cared a fig for any of them; for between them all, or at least their descendants, not much of their money had been left to me. But aside from the portraits, that old room was very dear to me, associ- ated as it was with my earliest recollections. Elsie's busy fingers had given the dark oaken floor a bright pol- ish. The same willing hands had kindled the fire, burn- ing with a cheerful ruddy flame on the hearth. On each side the cavernous chimney jams a great high-backed set- tle was sunken. Table and chairs of the same antique pattern were ranged around the room. It looked bright and pleasant in spite of its being old, and I see it all be- fore me plainly as I close my eyes in thought, going over once again that long delightful evening, for long and de- lightful it proved to be. I drew one easy-chair before the hearth, and gave him another. I thought he gave my cosy chair, which was oak and stiff backed like the rest of them, a peculiar look, as if he needed a clue as to how rest was to be obtained in it. However, I soon forgot that. We had so many things to talk of; at least I had. And while I was rattling on very volubly, my tongue hardly keeping pace with my thoughts, I wondered how I could ever have imagined Mr. Graime old. He might be any age between thirty and forty-five, the only thing indi- cating even that, being a few silver threads mingling with the dark hair, which was tossed carelessly back from the high, square forehead. It was the head of a Roman, proud, erect, defiant, in its bearing. Somewhere in the Lodge, we had an old bronze cast of Brutus, and there was an in- definable something in the proud head that brought the old Roman before me continually. He was not handsome--sim- ple beauty is detestable even in a woman-intolerable in -- .- ------ -S-   AT-IOL.         21 a man. There was a dignity of presence, a strength, and manly vigor about him, that one instinctively liked and recognized as superior. He wore the inevitable mus- tache of the nineteenth century, long, heavy, and almost covering a mouth, the only portion of which I saw was the firm under lip and glittering white teeth. His eye was dark and piercing. I felt as he looked at me, I was be- ing weighed in the balance, but strangely enough, the bashfulness I gave myself credit for possessing, was gone in his presence. There was a charm in all he said and did, and such a sense of friendliness and protection thrown suddenly around me, that at the close of the even- ing, all dread of the journey with him was gone. P It was late when he rose to go. I pressed him to remain, but no; the horse must be taken to the village and a coach for the next morning engaged. "( He had no idea it was so late,"7 he said, as I followed him to the hall door, and, notwithstanding his protestations that it was too damp for me to walk among the trees, I saw him down to the park gate. His horse stood outside the wicket, impatiently waiting. He untied him, stood by my side an instant, while the horse wheeled round and round, as if chafing under the long delay. The night was moonless but bright with kindling stars. He threw the rein over the tall iron post, and leaning upon the wicket, looked around upon the still evening landscape, and upward to the thickly studded heavens ; then drew me to his side and threw his plaid about my shoulders. And so we stood, while he pointed out to me constellation after constellation as they wheeled into space, a glitter- ing, silent host. It was all new, wonderful and strange, and I drank in his words with eager delight, for Mr. Craigie had never thus instructed me. Then with a fit- fulness which seemed natural to him, he declared he was wasting his time, and unfitting me for the journey of the   '-         ATHOL. morrow. Then taking my hand in his, he batde me pleasant . dreams for the night; told me that '" warm hearts were pre- pared to love me in my newhome; , leaned down, his long mustache just brushing my forehead,-as he gave me a care- less kiss, and leaping on his horse, he waved me a last good-night. I could hardly give him good-night", in return, my heart was so full; -but I leaned out over the gate, and followed hiln with my eyes, as well as the star- light night would permit, listening until the last echo of his horse's hoofs died away on the stony road. Then wrap- ping the plaid, which Mr. Graeme'had left,about me, I ran up the avenue and never stopped until, breathless, I threw myself in Elsie's arms and recounted to her the events of the day. She-had her sorrow all to herself that night, ungrateful girl that I wias! I could think of nothing but my guardi- an's nobe face, and the inexpressible charm of his win- ninger.    As for Elsie, I could and would not hear CrAPTER  . III. those words ringing in my ears and lulling me to noslber like strains of sweetest music, like far-offchimes of silver membrance that here my uneventful life'ended, and the dawning of a new existence began. Pleasure and pain' alternately reigned in my heart. I looked for Elsieubut early as it was, she was up preparing for the coming journey. My trunks, packed and corded, stood ready in   -': . vA..XATHOL.               23 my room. It did indeed assume the look of a farewell; and I sprang up, and hastily dressing, threw up my cham- ber window to take a last view. My home and the old familiar landscape never seemed so dear or alluring as on that morning when about to leave it forever. It is always the case, I believe, "blessings brighten as they take their flight." It was autumn, but a glorious autumn, lingering hand in hand with summer as if loth to part company. In through the open window stole faint sounds of stirring life. The roar of the beck in the hollow gave a healthful pulse to the atmosphere, while the faint song of the birds and the rustling of falling leaves were borne to my ear, all melting in one song, as if the great heart-beat of the dying sum- rmer had set itself to tune. A strange dead silence lay brooding over the house, but the garden looked inviting; so down the stirs I rushed, out on the broad -gravel walk, and then intits dewy shades. That dear old garden! How Elsie an-;I had planted, dug and watered i How we had watched to- gether the sweet blossoming flowers of spring; Elsie would be alone next year to do that! I could hardly real- ize it. There was a lump in my throat growing larger and larger with every such thought. " God bless you, dear old place," I kept saying over and over in my heart as I picked some of the few hardy flowers which had with- stood the first frosts; " these shall go with me to my new home, but the new love shall never efface the old. God bless you, dear old Lodge, and all who shall know the shelter of your roof." Sixteen happy years I had dwelt under its gray shadow, and from my inmost heart I blessed the quiet past. Then I turned away, giving to each and all a final look-a sort of mute farewell to my poor, faded, dying garden--then down farther I went to the little hollow, deeply furrowing the moor-side where     24          ATHOL. the turbulent beck flowed. High banks and a towering crag shut me in. Through the opening of the trees I caught a glimpse of the pure sky, very still, and liquid blue, over which a few white clouds sleepily chased each other. I thought of Thomas DeQuincey, and, out of his fragment of sky and white cloud, shaped dreams, but not like him, of death. Mine were of life. I lay on the crisp heather; I felt on my brow the cool, invigorating breath of the hills. With delight my ear drank in the familiar voice of the restless waters. "Oh," I thought, "life has at last come to me," and, like Richter, I resolved to "look upon every day as the whole of life, not merely as a sec- tion; to enjoy the present without wishing through haste to spring on to another section now lying before me.  Yes, I thought, after all, life is sweet and I am young. The present shall be a pleasure, the future a blissful anticipa- tion; and choking down the last remnant of a rising sob, I sank into a waking dream-a sort of sleep peculiar and incidental to youth-that sweet stupor of the senses, more delightful than real slumber, in which we so often love to lose ourselves. Jr^-  Lying there, utterly regardless of my coming journey, counting up all the quiet beauties of my home, a figure broke upon my view coming down the bank, crushing the short grass with a firm, self-reliant tread, paused, looked in the dusky recess, drew nearer, hung a moment above it. "So soon up?"- said he; " you revel in surprises, I be- lieve. Last night I was tempted to believe you a spirit born of the mountain. This morning you take shape from empty air as easily as if you were the Undine of these waters. Sprite, elfin, phantasy, speak, and break the spell!" "Good-morning,' I returned, de profundis. "Ah! that is real, that is substantial, and savors to me   :    -ATHOL.               25 oof a matter-of-fact breakfast and the day's journey. Come out of the depths and tell me, are you mortal like myself and therefore subject to the pangs of hunger as well as the allurements of hot coffee and seaming bacon? Because, little lady, if you are," taking At his watch, "r we have five minutes before breakfast, and after that no time at all." He held out his hand, but I sprang up the bank and was by his side in an instant. "I see you kept your promise of waking early," he began as we walked up the avenue. "But have you used the time to good advantage? Is everything in readi- ness?" "Years ago," I returned, "Elsie saw to all that, so I had nothing to do this morning but run around the old place saying good-bye. Elsie pat the finishing touches on my already packed trunks last night." "Speaking of Elsie, reminds me that this morning I proposed taking her with you. I foresaw a parting would be very painful." "Thanks, but you did not succeed?" "Oh no, she told me Scotland held her all." "Yes," I said, "we talked it all over; it must have been a year ago. I never knew my mother's wishes until then. Mr. Craigie is not very communicative, and only thought it was some time in the future, so put off the evil day: no, no, here' she will live and die. She is so attached to the place, and she will probably remain here. as house-keeper. Nothing could alienate her, I believe." "So I found out when I made the proposition, al- though her heart is solely tried by the separation. But see, there is Mr. Craigie. We have kept him waiting." "Yes, and by his anxiety of countenance, I can see the coffee is cooling." Standing on the stone steps of the porch, dressed in the same suit of snuffy brown, which I averred had been 2 26          ATHOL. born with him and grown with his growth, he looked by contrast with Mr. Graeme, an odd little figure enough. His long gray hair fell upon his shoulders, slightly bent from advancing age and much study. An old-fashioned shovel hat was driven so far over his forehead as effectually to conceal it, and threatened to cut him off from all observation of the world at large, by engulfing the eyes also. "Tempus fugit" was written all over every linea- ment of his face, as well as the garments which encased him. He pounced upon me the first thing, after a long- established fashion. "Breakfast is waiting," and he held out his watch to show the lateness of the hour. "Punctual- ity above all things," and he gathered me up under his arm, leading the way to the dining-room and giving me my usual lecture as we went. Thanks to Elsie's cooking, however, the well-seasoned dishes acted as a divertisment in my favor, and after pouring coffee and pretending to eat a breakfast I had no heart to swallow, I was excused and flew to my own room, whither Elsie soon followed me. We had short time enough to say all we wanted, for the coach was at the door, the impatient driver cracking his whip. Again and again I was called, and finding nothing was gained by delay, I desperately gave one part- ing glance to my little room, and, in a shower of tears I could not conceal, followed Elsie down the staircase. In front of the porch stood the heavy travelling carriage. Mr. Graeme was by its open door talking to the driver, who was strapping on the last trunk. It looked sadly enough like going. And now for the firSt time, with a strange perversity, I drew back, chilled at the thought of the long journey alone with him. He looked cold, I thought stern, but suddenly turning discovered me waiting, smiled,-and there was something in the smile at once reagsuring-ex- tended his hand: "Come, Miss Athol, say your adieus   ' i :,ATHOL.                 27 quickly, for we must reach Stirling before sunset, and the horses are impatient for the road." Then I had to say good-bye, or rather express it, for I could not utter a word. I threw my arms around Elsie's neck, and pressed my lips again and again to her wither- ed cheek. And to Elsie no words were needed; she felt all, and more, in that ardent clasp, than I could convey in words; and silently clinging together, we, who had nev- er for one day in those quiet sixteen years been separated, meekly exchanged farewells. Then Mr. Groeme gently took me away from her and helped me in, turned back, shook hands with Mr. Craigie, slipped something in Elsie's brown palm and entered the carriage. "You have been a good child, Athol. I shall miss you sadly over that last half of zEschylus," was Mr. Crai- gie's last remark, as he tenderly bade me good-bye, brought suddenly to a recollection of our parting, by seeing me fairly started. Nothing but positive shocks ever disturbed my old friend, and I was surprised now to see his emotion ; yet even in his sorrow, he could not resist a parting admo- nition. "I have packed up all your books for you, child," he continued, "and you must let me know how you get on. I marked the passage where we left off. God bless you always, and don't forget to keep up the Greek." The horses shook their heads, the driver cracked his whip, and away down the broad avenue we dashed. I had forever left my home. Now indeed I realized it, and gazing through blinding tears I left the two waiting figures in view-Mr. Craigie, with hands thrust deeply in pack- ets, and hat farther than -ever over the forehead; and Elsie, with apron to her eyes, stood just as we had left them-poor lonely old people. I watched them through the mist of fast falling tears until they were lost to view. Then my eye eagerly took in the dark mass of stone, the high pointed windows, the battlements around the top. ?'  28          ATHOL. Leaning from the carriage window I looked out upon the wide undulating park dotted with ancient trees, until we were whirled through the stone archway and tall iron gates. Then out toward the tranquil hills stretched the white stony road; the calm beauty of a rare autumn day resting over all. A rushing flood of memories over- whelmed my heart, Every foot of ground was known and dear to me. Now I was seeing it for the last time, and it was with an intensity of eagerness I watched every fa- miliar feature, endeavoring to lose nothing in my farewell view. Those dear old hills and fields among which I had been so happy. Would I ever know the same quiet hap- piness elsewhere? and as the memory of all swept over my soul, I sobbed aloud. Mr. Granme had been leaning from his side of the carriage, absorbed as I in the flitting panorama spread before us. So intent was he, he did not heed me until I could control myself no longer. Ther. he turned to me, kindly I knew, from the tone in which he spoke, but I did not dare trust myself with a look. "Child, child, this will never do. I shall regard Iny- self as a barbarian if I see nothing but tears. Tell me, what is it afflicts you so?" He quietly possessed himself of one of my hands, al- though I tried to rid myself of his clasp. It however did more to reassure me than anything he might have said and bending my head down upon it I tried to stay the tor- rent of my grief. For a little while he said nothing, only stroked back my hair with his free hand until my sobbing ceased. "I do not know what ails me," I half whispered, " this is the first time I have cried so-in years. But I felt so strange and frightened-besides, I never left home be- fore." He lifted my head up and transferred it to a better resting-place, his shoulder. I could not meet his look,   ATHOL.          29 so I pulled my curls over my face half ashamed already of my childish tears. I absolutely grew still with sur- prise, when, retaining my hand in his, he with the other took all the long curls and drew them back to their place again. If it had been Mr. Craigie or Elsie, I should have jerked them back again, in a way quite peculiar to myself in those days. As it was, a certain something checked me, and I passively allowed him to arrange my hair as he liked. It took him some time to do this; meanwhile he had a good view of my face. "Now tell me what those tears were for," at length he said, while he was twisting my hair around his fingers. "Were you so grieved at leaving Derwent?" I started, and looked up at him now. "No, indeed, I am glad to get away. I want a new home. It was just a momentary feeling-just the parting. I feel better now," and indeed I had calmed myself already into a very hap- py, quiet state of mind. "It is very natural you should feel so," he returned, only for my sake try and control yourself-my only object is your happiness." The tone was so kind, I felt already that for his sake I might do much more than dismiss the tears. "I remember very well," he continued, ' my first expe- rience of leaving home; but with all a boy's inveterate shame of that most womanish weakness, tears, I could not forego the luxury of an unrestrained indulgence when alone." "How old were you?"I asked. "Fifteen." Such a great boy to cry!" And how old are you, Miss Athol?" "Sixteen," I returned, a little consciously, but then one always expects more from boys."     30          ATHOL. "Do they? Well, all I can say is the expectations are seldom realized; but there is some difference beside age and sex which inclines me to look leniently upon your sorrow, Your are exchanging an old tried home for a new untried one, while I was being immured in a univer- sity only for a term of years with the confident hope of a return." ' What university? I asked, hoping he would tell me solmnething of himself. "Heidelberg." "Heidelberg?"I said, at once interested. "I have read all about the old town, with its ivy-covered ruined tower, where the nightingales sing. You have heard them Mr. Graeme?" He shrugged his shoulders. ," I have tasted the beer of the town, which is far better than a nightingale's song, let me tell you. A good pipe and mug of ale are not to be despised in- this practical age ;" then, seeing the look of disappointment my face wore, he went off into a gay description of his college life, which so interested me that in an hour's time forgetting all my sorrow, we were talking as gayly as if nothing had happened. He often spoke of his sisters, oftenest of the elder, Mrs. Fleming, always calling her sister. "He knew sister would love me," he said, " and indeed so would the others.' "Mr. Graeme," I said, with the sudden impetus which governed my every action, " and are these three sisters all? Have you no father, mother, wife or children of your own?  " A sudden shadow  darkened his face, ' God never bestowed the latter upon me," he returned bitterly; " and the first two went home to Him years ago. All that remains of our once cherished household, are- these three sisters I have told you of." When he spoke of "  those three sisters" the deep, happy look came back to his eyes. "Ah!" he said, "little girl, it will seem good   ATHOL.          31 to be again in that dear quiet home,. to me more precious in its narrow limits, than the wide circle of the world. I have been a storm-tossed traveller on the sea of life so long, that Brookdell is a haven of rest, my port of peace." He looked down at me, saw my uplifted face, smiling and happy in spite of recent tears. "I am glad I too am bound for that haven," I said, meeting his look, " no more tears to-day." There was answer enough in his eye; it thanked me more plainly than words, and I felt from that time for- ward we -should have a perfect understanding which would know no weakness or decline. The carriage rolled on over the stony road, plunging into the heart of a wild and thinly settled country, a part of which I had never seen. The keen love of change which reigns paramount in every young heart had entirely superseded my former grief, and quite content and smil- ing, I gave myself up to the charm of my companion's conversation. In' desultory chat the hours went by. We travelled well, only stopping at Callender- to dine and rest; but as the day wore on, a sense of weariness and fatigue oppressed me. Mr. Groeme too grew silent and absorbed. I sat and wratched him, thinking of the future. Gradually thought became a dream.  Visible objects ceased to be distinct; from very passiveness my eyes closed, my head sank back. I felt it gently lifted to its former place on my guardian's shoulder, then I sank to sleep. When I awoke we were passing through a well cultivated and fertile region, the fields and farm houses wore a cheerful air of plenty, indicating an approach to a more populous country. Then the sparkling waters of the Teith broke upon my view, and rolling over the fine old bridge, we caught a flitting glimpse of the " once ban- nered towers of Doune." It was nearly sunset, apd real- ly fatigued with my long day's ride, I was closing my eyes  32          A ATHOL. again, when an exclamation of pleasure from my hitherto silent companion, roused me, and hastily bending forward I shared with him the enjoyment of the scene. Clear against the sky stood the Grampians, and fantastically wreathing and losing itself in green, stole the silver wind- ings of the Teith, the Forth, the Allan. But before all, grand and majestic, rose the tall and frowning towers of Stirling, the immense rock looming up completely hiding the town from view. It was the first time I had ever seen the bold and legend-chronicled castle, the scene of Elsie's oft-repeated nursery tales, and in later years clus- tering with sad historical associations; and my heart swelled with tragic and romantic memories, when I re- membered the long line of monarchs who had found a home within its sombre walls. Here too had lived that unfortunate queen, the mere thought of whose name brought before me a vision of regal magnificence and superb beauty, and gazing upon the very spot where the shadow of the crown first hung its weight of care upon her brow, brought nearer than ever to my heart, the fear- ful tragedy of her ill-starred life. "Athol," said my guardian, suddenly breaking the silence, " think of the brilliant coronation, the nuptial re- joicing, the courtly beauty, the gallant knight, the ringing laughter-and then the death shriek, the prayer to God, the assassin's knife, the hushed halls and fled music, the tramp of mailed feet no longer-and what is left? Fame, riches, honor, power, all levelled into common dust; the hope of millions, the terror of the world, the pride and idol of a nation, all resolved in one little word-dust- years and years ago. Child," he said looking down into my eyes, "when we wish to measure the shortness and insignificance of life, we have only to dream in the shad- ow of such blood-stained walls as these.' The sun just flashed through the high pointed windows   ::?: ATHOL.              33 and a stream of light, redder than rubies, smote upon my eye. "See," I said, "it is indeed a bloody tower within whose circuit dread A Douglass by his sovereign bled,'" and riding round the rock we entered the town, just as the last crimson gleam flooded the sky. CHAPTER IV. THE next morning we were on our way to Edinburgh and thence to London by rail, and on the seventh day af- ter leaving home we were gliding swiftly down the Mer- sey, then sailing fast away seaward, toward a home I knew not, leaving behind me forever my native land. Lean- ing upon my guardian's arm, I kept my position on deck until we passed Holyhead, and gazed far out upon the Isle of Man, while beyond Anglesea, I caught a glimpse of cloudy cones and blue surges of lesser hills waning beyond, with depth on depth of purpled shadows floating between. "Look!"I exclaimed, with a heart as void of care as if this were only a day's parting and not forever- "Look, is it not a beautiful farewell? I always think the aspect of the sky ominous. Now, if it had rained to- day, my future would have been dark and gloomy as the clouds; but you see from the very moment I left, sunshine and warmth attended me. You remember the rare sunse at Stirling? and now "-I pointed toward the outline of fast fading" coast and looked up in his face for answer.     34          ATHOL. He met my look and gave me a returning smile. X"Child, who put all those silly fancies in your head-- not Elsie again?" "Yes, just Elsie, and I like it. I used to say to my- belf, if the wind blows this way or that, my guardian will not come to-day--oh! you need not laugh, it always came true-and the very night I met you I had a presentiment." "By one of these unfailing signs?" "Oh! if you are going to make fun I'll go no further," I said with offended dignity, and leaning over the taffrail I watched the silver foam the vessel made in her speed. "I did not intend making fun of you, child," he said with an amused air, " and to show you my sincerity will accept the omen; but I must make a Suggestion. You are looking back toward the land you have left. My rule would be to look forward." I laughed, but turned, threw a quick glance on the broad level waste spreading before me, then up to the smiling heaven floating down to the. horizen in a broad blue curve, melting with the sea in a misty line hardly discernible. "One little cloud," I said, " only one, Elsie herself would be perfectly satisfied. I, too, will accept the omen." "Foolish girl! Do you not remember how the little cloud, no larger than a man's hand, grew until it covered the heavens so they were black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain?" "Oh! I choose to take my own view of the matter." "Forewarned, forearmed." "But I am not forewarned, and never meano be, Mr. Graime--" "When are you going to call me John? Is Mr. Graeme a cousinly style of nomenclature?" "Oh! but I cannot yet you know, I have only known you a week--"     "Indeed? and when two weeks are passed, shall you be any nearer that consummation of cousinly compact?" "When we are home,-hear that-home, it sounds very sweetly to me-I will try. I was so wretched the day I left Derwent, wasn't I?"I said suddenly, thinking of my almost forgotten parting; "I am almost too happy now. Are you so happy? Do you lille this going home, too?" "Aye, my child, as I told you before, it is the one hap- piness of iny life. The only bright spot in an all too bar- ren desert." "Desert?"I returned, laughing and amazed. "Why Mr. Graeme this world is a paradise, and life a perpetual draught from a cup overflowing with sweets. I only wish I could convey to you my receipt for this unfailing joy which floods my heart always." . "I should need to drink again of the fountain of youth," he- said half sadly. "But now you must go down, the wind is too fresh for you." I begged for just a little while longer on deck, but he was inexorable, so down I went, and spent the remain- der of the day exploring the lower regions and becoming acquainted with my state-room, which seemed to me at first too ridiculously small for anything. However, I had to live and breathe there, stifling as it seemed, for the four or five days ensuing. The demon of the sea held me in his chains a weary stretch of time-a weary time indeed! When I lay hour after hour in a helpless, hopeless kind of a way, caring for nothing in the whole wide world, having no fear of the sea or storms which might come, scarcely choosing to put out my hand, if in so doing I might save my wretched life! Mr. Graeme was kind, the steward- ess attentive, and my fellow-passengers, those of them who were exempt from the same fate, were all courtesy; but to this day I shudder at the mere mention of that voyage,   "u         AATHOL. and would not brave another for worlds. After a time the sickness passed, but I was nervous and prostrated, and longed, with a frightened kind of longing, for some place to pillow my head besides the swaying little crib I so de- tested. Oh! for the cool, quiet room at Derwent, and the touch of Elsie's tender fingers. The very plash of the waves against the vessel's side made me distracted and I wearied my guardian with the oft-repeated question "Will we ever se'e land? Will we ever reach home?" At length Mr. Grame declared I must go on deck. I would never get well below; but I refused. I knew it would make me worse. Even' the swaying of the vessel when I tried to stand, agonized me; but he was peremptory and insisted upon carrying me up. I yielded of course. If he had proposed a trip to the mountains of the moon I should not have entered a protest probably. So he took me in his arms very carefully and tenderly, wrap- ping me in my warm heavy plaid, and carried me up on the deck, where a nice little arrangement of blankets and robes was awaiting me. Weak and trembling I clung to him for support, and shut my eyes that I might not see the long white waves chasing each other with weary monotony over the blue sea. But Mr. Grarme only al- lowed me to remain there an hour, then he carried me down to my little room again, where I was glad to be at rest. But each day the prescribed rule was carried out, and I, at last, was forced to own him axgood physician. A day or two after I was on deck of my own accord and was myself the rest of the passage, which proved a long but pleasant one. It was the season of the year for heavy gales, but we seemed to have fallen on a fortunate time for our voyage. It was Sunday. Our last day out, we hoped, for the captain gave us every encouragement we should see port before night. I shall not soon forget that pleasant last t that pleasant last    Sabbath on board ship, for in it I learned more of my guardian's true character than I had in all the time gone before. Everything went on quietly. The usual prayers and a sermon were read by the captain, and after dinner I found myself on deck, and, from mere force of habit, a Bible in my hand. Elsie had on this point been decided, and from my earliest recollection this book was the only allowable one for that day. So Mr. Graeme found me a few hours later, my hand resting upon its open pages, my eyes vacantly 'fixed on the receding waves. I did not move when he came up. I was too much occupied fol- lowing out a train of thought, so I did not withdraw my gaze even when he spoke. "Well, child, what tense is your mood to-day? Past, present or future?" I only shook my head absently. "What then? What new crotchet in the whimsical little brain?" and he threw himself beside me. "I was only thinking," I said slowly, closing my eyes and leaning back, for I did not feel like talking. But he only said in that peculiarly teasing way of his: "Of what?" I turned and looked at him, and then half reluctantly yielded to that fascination of eye and will, that with me, already accomplished its end. But I averted my face as I answered: "Only, I have been reading in the Bible, that beauti- ful shadowy chapter, about the building of the new Jeru- salem, and the clouds piled up so gorgeously, laid the foundation of the Imperial City. The sailors say it looks like a storm, but to me it is only a temple, a vast cathedral, most catholic and solemn Which God hath planned.' Look at these black clouds with the tawny edge, and the     i      38 38          ATHOL. great white ones tossing up below. They are the great pearly gates! 'Every several gate of one pearl.'" "What put such ideas into your head, child?" said my guardian, after a moment's surprised silence. "I did not think you were such a fanciful little puss after all." , I told you-reading that chapter. And then see, how the sun strikes the water with long narrow path. I can almost fancy it the streets of the new city, 'pure gold, like as it were transparent gmlassci    pure odlike asit were transparent glass.' Do you like Revelation?" "No? Why not?" "Oh! it is too mystical and full of hyperbole. If you want grandeur, sublimity, and strength, you can only find it in the Prophets. One bold trumpet blast of Isaiah, one wail of Jeremiah, is }worth all the Bible together. Take for instance this." He turned over the leaves, and read slow- ly with a clear appreciation, all of the chapter, beginning with the grand and glorious burst: "Who is this that cometh from Edom. With dyed garments from Bozrah."1 His voice sank as he came upon that passionately agoniz- ing wail, "I have trodden the wine press alone," then melted into unconscious tenderness at the verse: "In all their afflictions he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them, in his love and in his pity he re- deemed them and bare them and carried them all the days of old." Mr. Grioeme had a fine deep voice, and he read with such fervor and strength it prompted the question.: Do you love the Bible, Mr. Graeme?' He seemed surprised, then said, while something of a shadow dispelled the momentary enthusiasm "I love the Books, of the Prophets. Not from any feeling of devoutness, but only with an appreciation of their poetic beauties and sublimity of thought and ex- pression. Beyond that it never touches me, it never   -go           ATHOL.          39 reaches my heart, and so momentary the impression, it is effaced almost as soon as produced. I have been a ' doubting Thomas' all my life." "Oh 1 Mr. Grame 1 "I said in sorrowful surprise. ' I did not mean to distress you, my child," he re- turned quickly, "I did not know-indeed I did not think you cared for those things any more than I." "I do' not care for them enough, that I know; but I am not an unbeliever. Every word of the Bible I accept in truth, it touches my heart and I revetntly bow to its teachings, but I lack the earnest devourt love which the life of a true Christian insensibly sheds abroad, the mak- ing that' one object in life my all in all, and yet Mr. Grame, without the hope that one day I shall clasp this sweet be- lief to my heart, as an anchor to the soul both sure and steadfast, life would be a prolonged terror, a fearful look- ing forward to judgment to come." He was silent a minute or two, then he said abstract- edly: "A strange world we live in, child-the future seems to be like that--" he pointed toward the open toss- ing sea, " and we, the travellers on this fitful sea of life, ever drifting in alternate storm and calm, sweeping over its unquiet waves, through Life and on to Death-and what beyond? Can the eye of faith pierce the veil? Tell me, child, what to your simple heart is Death? Utter annihilation? Or shall those that have departed live on forever and forever in a land where wrongs are righted and tears and'sorrow swept away?" "Do you not know? Have you not read?" and low and reverently I repeated from the chapter I had been dreaming over: "' And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more death, neither sor- row or crying, neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things are passed away." There was silence for a moment, then I said' softly,   AT 1 HOL. fearing lest I should displease him, "Does not your heart tell you this is true?" "Oh!" he said, and the shade I had noticed before swept over his face, "little girl, never doubt; doubt is twin sister to despair. Once let it enter your heart, and forever you are steeped in the blackness of a never-ending night." "It is a fearful thought," I said shudderingly. "No God, no hope--" "No, not that. I must believe in a God, a creative power. I am not so wild or weak as to give myself up to unlimited skepticism. But to me, there is no wisdom or justice in creating merely to destroy. This is not the beneficence of a God, but the weakness of mortal revenge -I have groped blindly all my life in this thick shadow, and am no nearer a conclusion than I was at first. This great over-ruling hand and power, whatever it may be, is beyond all comprehension."' "But your mortal soul?"I questioned, ' can that sleep forever?" He smiled his sarcastic smile, mocking and shimmer- ing as sheet lightning. "iAnd where is your proof of the soul's ultra-mundane existence?. Life is the soul, I am sometimes inclined to think. When the torch is extinguished in the grave, what shall rekindle the flame?" "But the grave cannot quench the flame," I'persisted "It must burn on, more and more brightly beyond in a boundless eternity than it ever did, or can, in this dim world of ours. Oh, no! the soul can never die! It is the spark of life immortal which God gives us with our birth His breath fans the feeble flame, and it becomes a living soul. Were your doctrine true," I went on, " how dark  and terrible life would be. No motive then to rise above I mere earth longings; no rest for those who have borne their cares on earth so heavily-"   "Hush, child! I have thought of that before," he said in a low suppressed voice; " but it was an idle dream--let us never talk of this thing again. I would not disturb your'simple child-faith for the world. I would not have a doubt darken your future-let us talk of anything on earth but this," and he abruptly walked forward looking out upon the night. !:ii  For while we had been talking the sun had buried itself in westering clouds, and my rose-tinted temple had faded, settling into sober leaden hues, while on the east- ern verge the moon, like a great bubble of light, was burst- ing through a tangled cloud. But Mr. Graeme was not apparently engaged with either sea or sky. He began pacing restlessly to and fro on the deck. The moonlight fell full on his tall, erect figure, the massive rugged head, the stern, finely cut features. He looked more like my old Roman idol than ever, his hair tossed back, his dark eyes, fearless and bold, seemed as if longing to pierce the clouds and solve this mighty mystery. Up and down he paced with quick, elastic, self-reliant step. How grand and elegant he seemed to me, treading so lightly and firmly-as firmly as if he were treading down every ob- stacle in life! I watched him until I was tortured with the belief that I had offended him. At length he returned. "The only question that re- mained to be solved is one of fate," he said with a sort of sadness in his voice unusual to him. "Disappointment, sorrow and death, this is the beginning and end of the thing called Life. I have lived mine-it has been a fail- ure. I look for nothing here, and for the future I will do like you-hope." I opened my mouth to speak, but in a sudden change of mood he put out his hand playfully, and covered my lips. "Not another word! absolutely and positively I     42          ATHOL. haven't felt so misanthropic in years." He drew my arm within his own and folded my wraps more closely about me. "Let us walk, talk, do anything to shake off this dolorous gloom," and we began slowly pacing the un- steady deck. The cool night wind blew freshly around us, the moon bathed everyth ig in a flood of silver light. The plash of the lapsing waters lulled me with its audible murmur in a dream of happiness, as I walked thus by my guardian's side.        / "Do you know, petite," he said suddenly, "we may be home in a few hours, if all goes well and the captain is good authority." "And the perils of the sea over," I said with a shiver. "I shall never, never cross it again." "What! such a little coward! and I have crossed it a dozen times or more!"  "I could brave the dangers of the sea with calmness," I ventured, "but I cannot endure the horrors of a second sea sickness! It is like coming from death to life, to be here on the deck with you to-night." We made a long evening of it. Mr. Grame had changed his mood entirely. He talked of everything, and told me tales of travel and wild adventure, and gay sight- seeing abroad, until I looked upon him with wonder and amazement, believing he had seen every part of the hab- itable globe. Once or twice it occurred to me he was feigning gayety, to shake off the gloom which hung over him; but it was a long pleasant evening in spite of the  evident effort I detected on his part. But like all pleas-  ant things, it had an end. It was quite midnight before I went to sleep. I could not close my eyes for the thoughts which crowded in my mind; and if I did at last from very weariness, it was ever my guardian whom I saw, his voice sounding in my ears, his hand I yet felt upon my own. I perplexed myself that night on my restless pillow with    ....   ATHOL.          43 questions I could not answer, doubts I could not solve, and wpndered, in spite of positive conviction to the -con- trary, if there ever lived a nobler, truer man. And so when I fell asleep at last my very latest thought was of Mr. Groeme. When I awoke the faint gray dawn was creeping in my room. I sprang up and dressed hastily. I looked out of the little window. A fine line of misty white sand divided sea and sky. It was my first glimpse of the new land to which I was coming a stranger. I went up quick- ly on deck. Mr. Graeme stood almost as I had left him the night before, on the after deck. He was talking to one of the sailors, and did not see me until I put my arm playfully within his own. He started and turned suddenly. "You here, petite " Then he put his hand under my chin and looked searchingly in my face. "You were as restless as I last night, you slept none." "But I did, though I will frankly confess, a troubled sleep it was. It is too new a thing for me to travel, and I am impatient and feverish with an anxiety I have no skill to conceal." "And I, old traveller that I am, sat up all night with the watch, from the same unhappy cause, little one," he said patting my cheek. "There was some mesmeric in- fluence abroad, affecting us alike." ", And I wanted to be the first to see my new home." "Then look,' and he pointed to the gleam of white sand stretching away on one side, the high tower of a light- house on the other. So we two stood watching point after point as it came before us out of the mist of sea and sky. "You are pale, little one," he said, looking down at me. "You will need the strong breath of the hills to put roses on your cheeks again."    "          ATHOL.              X And then I try and tell him how I long to reach our haven of rest, and we go on smoothly and swiftly through the waters, gliding past Sandy Hook light-house and the bold rough headland of Neversink. Coming up the broad, beautiful foam-flecked bay, and creeping through the dull red light of early dawn, Mr. Graeme points out familiar places to me. Then we enter the Narrows, passing the forts, and salutes are fired, and we glide past the little isl- ands, with the first beams of the morning sun glancing on the white tents, and the starry flags fluttering from the flag- staffs on the forts, and I see the glitter of guns,-and senti- nels slowly pacing up and down, and then, suddenly shap- ing itself through the misty golden air, the outlines of a great city loom up before me with a bewildering forest of spires, cupolas and towers, and a fine mazy network of masts bristling around it. All kinds of craft are busily plying the waters, and among them we glide, swiftly near- ing our port, and Mr. Grame and I still gaze. I, with eager, expectant eyes, at the great beautiful city spread before us, with its populous shores on either side of the broad river, all blending in one great whole, until I am confused and perplexed to know where we shall ever land. And what a glad, grateful heart I bear that morning, and how at last wearied with the delay and bustle of land- ing, I am almost lifted in my guardian's arms, carried down the plank, and on the busy, crowded dock, with its mass ofjostling, hurrying people; and finally, after delays which are interminable, we find ourselves rattling over the stony streets in a comfortable carriage; and I give such a great sigh of relief at feeling myself once more on terra fir- ma, that Mr. Grseme laughingly declares he will never have me for a fellow-traveller again. And when, grateful, con- tent and happy, we reach our hotel at last, I fancy it the palace of Alnascher, and am lost for a season in its im- mense saloon and wide spreading halls; and am still far-   ATHOI).          45 ther lost at night in my capacious bed, and wake once or twice, and with thankfulness miss the swaying of the vessel. And then, after giving me two or three days of rest and quiet and a small mixture of sight-seeing, I find myself in the gray of an early morning, seated by Mr. Graeme's side, wheeling rapidly through all the windings of that most beautiful road, the Housatonic. All these things are like a pleasant dream for me to remember even now. CHAPTER V. IT was a beautiful ride up among the hills,but the short day was nearly spent when we reached the station. There was the customary amount of bustle, clamor and' jostling as Mr. Groeme handed me from the cars. For a' moment I could hardly see surrounding objects through the gathering gloom; then I gradually became aware of the lights of a little village blinking below us, and at the end of the platform a carriage in waiting. The man took off his hat as we approached, disclosing a true Milesian accent in his welcome home, respectfully spoken. "Thank you, Owen," said Mr. Graeme, " and the fami- ly, are they all well?" "Pretty well, sir," he rejoined, springing to the box, "but tired waiting for you. I have been to the depot every night since the vessel arrived. Miss Harrie, she-" "But Mrs. Fleming?" interrupted my guardian. "Not at all well, sir, but" nodding his head; " between you and me, sir, it will all be right in the morning. She has been fretting since she read your arrival. But they be waiting, sir," and touching the fine horses with his whip, away we flew down the hill toward the village.     "         ATHOL.               ;: 1, "We shall'soonbe there now," said Mr. Graeme, wrap- .- ping my shawl around me, and laying his hand on mine.  He must have felt the thrill his words sent quivering  , through my frame for he bent down and whispered: . "' Silly child, and if we are almost there, are you sorry I do not like to tell you how sorry," I returned, and I tried to smile, but somehow or other, the tears wouldi come in spite of my effort to restrain them. Very gently they were wiped away. "I thought you liked the idea of coming home so much," he said softly. "So I did-and so I will still," I replied, forcing back the choking sensation in my throat, " only they are so  I strange and I know you now so well-besides, I fancied   ; they might not all be liBe you."             1 "Little flatterer," and he patted the hand which lay in his. "Ah! this is delightfully home-like," as we turned into a quiet street; "look out, child, your first view of a New England village,--how does it suit?"  "Not at all," I replied, " by gas-light"-giving a con- temptuous glance at the white cottages on either side of the broad street., I wondered if we should live in such a i little house, and was rejoiced to find ourselves rolling quickly past out into the open country again.       i "So," I said, with a sigh of relief, breaking the silence, "we are not to stop there after all!" Mr. Greeme laughed.  "What was that dismal sigh for? relief or regret?"  Positive relief. I should stifle, I know, in that littleI close town, but perhaps Brookdell is like it."  "No, only the name of my place, and there it is." I stood up in the carriage, and looked out over the  open country, as well as the gathering night would per- " mit.. There was a  light sparkling on a rise of ground above and toward which Mr. Graeme pointed, with "Hur-   ATIIroL.         47 ry up, Owen," and putting the horses forward, although it was a regular ascent, we soon whirled through tall iron gates and up a broad avenue bordered with overhanging trees, lost the light entirely as we wound around a little lake with a falling fountain, then drove rapidly up to where it gleamed brightly through the long, curtained windows. This was all I could see in the uncertain light, except it was a large irregular house, with a wide veranda run- ning across the front. "At last!"said Mr. Graeme as the carriage stopped at the stone steps, " and I, for one, am not sorry-come, child." But I drew back with a strange 'perversity, only feel- ing if this dreaded meeting was over I would give any- thing in the world. At the sound of the wheels the door wax suddenly opened and a lady stood in the doorway. "Come at last," she cried, "Oh! John, I am so glad!" For a moment he held her in his embrace, then he forcibly lifted me out and placed me in her arms. "I am Alice," she said very kindly kissing me, "( and I am very glad you are come, little cousin," and holding me by the hand she led me directly into the hall. It was large, square and old-fashioned. The doors on either side were open. A pleasant warmth diffused itself through the rooms. Within, all was tinged with a cheerful glow from ruddy grate and burning lamp. I had just time to take in this view with a quick glance, when a lady advanced slowly from the inner room. My guardian rushed quickly forward, and, for a mo- ment she clung to him convulsively. "John," I heard her say, " thank God, home at last! I have been so wretched!'         ' "Did you not get my letter?" "Yes, but it was not yourself i! Every time you go away I think you will never come back to me again."     48          ATHOL. "But I am here now, darling," hen said with soft re- proach. a And Athol?" "Here she is, safe and well. She is ours now,' he  said, as he placed my hand in hers. She stooped down, giving me a warm embrace. "Athe4, my child," she murmured in the sweetest voice I had ever heard, " you are very welcome to Brook- dell," and she'still retained my hand as, she led me into one of the large rooms opening from the hall. A pale, delicate-looking young man was standing on the hearth. He came rapidly forward at the sound of our voices and was rapturously greeted by Mr. Graeme as "' Guy, old fellow, how are you!" then presented more decorously to me as Mr. Fotheringham. He shook my hand cordially, said something pleasant about my jour- ney, while the younger of the two ladies drew up a chair for Mr. Graeme before the grate. Meanwhile Mrs. Flem- ing-I knew by a sort of intuition it was the " sister" spoken of so almost reverentially by my guardian-rapidly divested me of my cloak and shawl. She untied the strings of my travelling bonnet and laid it aside; then kissed my flushed and trembling cheek, and putting back my hair, gazed long and earnestly at me. It was a care- worn, but still beautiful face I looked up to in return. In that one glance my eye took in the beautiful proportions of her slight figure, delicate features and exquisite com- plexion; but there was something about the mouth so rigidly beautiful that it struck me painfully at .once. It spoke so of suffering -and determined endurance. -And the eyes-those soft brown eyes which were searching mine-they might have had fire in them once, but it must have burnt out long years back, for as they looked at me from beneath the fringed lashes they seemed misty and dim with unshed tears.                ;   ATHOL.          49 "Yes," she said, " a Groeme! Is she not, dear brother? So like her mother--my child, you are very welcome to our home." Then she fluttered softly to her brother's side. I sat and watched her as she passed her hand caressingly over his jetty locks, smoothing them back from the high square forehead with her delicate white hand. It was the action of a tender mother rather than sister. So like they ,were too, and yet so unlike. She had his finely cut fea- tures, but moulded more delicately; his counterpart, yet subdued, refined, chastened. In the mean time Alice had carried off my wrappings, given orders about my trunks, and returned to my side. "-How cold you must be," she said, " and tired too, I know.". I entered a disclaimer. I, who had lived among the mountains all my life to shiver at the breath of the Berk- shire hills? that was absurd, beside I was so wrapped up. "Ah! yes, brother John understands that; but winter r is very ftear to us now-last night we had a slight frost for the first time, and the woods around us are perfectly gorgeous with color. You found the ride wearisome from New York?" "Oh! no, delightful! The scenery is perfection, and I was charmed." "Very true; but travelling is so disagreeable, and the city is my pet horror. To tell you the truth, my dear," she said pleasantly, ' I go nowhere. Sister and I devote ourselves to one another and quiet. But now you are come, we shall have to make ourselves a little more endur- able. Brother's absence has made us quite selfish, and Harrie, poor child, has been forced to do up all tthe gay- eties of the place alone." All this was said in such a natural, winning .way, it quite won my heart. "And where is my other cousin?"I ventured to ask, 3     50          ATHOL. for now I knew Alice and Mrs. Fleming, I longed to see what Harrie was like.      J : I heard the clatter of Spit's hoofs an hour ago on the walk," said Mr. Fotheringham, "and concluded Harrie was off to the depot." "Where she has been every night since we began looking for you. She had an idea you were going to steal upon us unaware,' said Mrs. Fleming. "Poor child, she will be disappointed at missing you." While Alice sat talking on a low chair by my side, I noticed how very plain she was, at least by comparison with the elder sister. She had, however, such an ease and grace of manner that in a short time we were talking as naturally as if we had known each other always. Mr. Fotheringham, too, drew up his chair near ours, and we threatened great sociability, when the door was suddenly burst open, and standing within its entrance ap- peared just one instant the figure of a young girl. She wore a long, dark riding-habit. A drooping hat shaded her face. In a moment Mr. Groeme sprang up with one of his most brilliant smiles to greet her, and was half smothered in embraces, kisses, and a storm of breathless ejaculations. 9"John! dear brother John! I was so stupid I thought I'd have plenty of time, but that provoking Terry kept me waiting so long, though I do assure you I made Spit fly when I heard the whistle at the depot, and you are here ahead of me after all! I went through the village like mad when I found the cars arrived. And Athol, too, so glad--" and without waiting for an introductioni she swept over to me giving me the heartiest kiss and welcome I had yet received. Flood after flood of questions she poured upon us both, sitting perched upon the arm of my chair, scarcely waiting for an answer, until at length she paused breathlessly.   ATHOL.          51 "Do, some one, talk and give me a rest. Ask away, brother, I am all attention. How have I been in your absence? Disconsolate! Wept and moaned at my usual rate, traces of sorrow yet discernible in my pale and at- tenuated cheeks. What have I done? Teased Guy, flirted with old Trueman, broken two horses and almost lmy neck! gave up my German. I sent that pig-headed Sdhwindon out of the house, John, the minute I was sure 6 you',ere gone! I've had a nice time all my own way. What am I going to do-? Kiss and make up, and then propose tea, for I am famished Athol, and you certainly are," and walking to the beaufet she began measuring tea with her hat on and her gloves and whip, tucked under her arm. Alice looked on with a resigned air while Harrie rap- idly lighted the lamp and set it under the urn. "It is all true," she said in a quiet way. "Harrie has indeed ruled the house." '"Now Alice," returned that young lady, c don't put on such a martyrish air, as if you were going to the stake. I am no feminine Nero, if I did rule. Come, John, ring for supper." Not I, until you have changed that attire for one i more presentable." Harrie shrugged her shoulders. "I have dressed in any garb I pleased, brother, for a year nearly, and no one has ventured a remonstrance," k and she pouted wilfully. I looked on in surprise at her quick movements and bright, imperious ways. Her figure was striking and set off to fine advantage by the long sweeping habit she wore, which was dark green, buttoned closely to the throat, and terminating in a narrow, flat collar. Her hair, which was brown like that of Alice, was arranged in heavy braids on each side and shaded in a remarkably brilliant, though by     52          ATHOL.             ,; no means strictly beautiful, face. And yet there was a charm about her to me irresistible. A sense of freshness and life which only comes with happiness and youth. She had vivid, fluctuating color, her complexion was fair and  clear; her eyes, large and dark blue, were vivacious and expressive. She had her brother's firm, self-reliant step, and his erect, elastic pride of bearing. All the time she  was making tea she was talking, and I saw at a glance - that this youngest twig of the Grame tree had indeed had- it all her own way. A very good way, too, if you were to believe her own story. "Brother John," she began, "I told Owen to rub the horses down and let them stand."     . "For pity's sake what for?" said Mr. Graeme looking up in laughing amazement. "To take Guy home, to be sure," she returned. "You wouldn't have him go tramping all the way to the village the first night you came home-it would be a sin and; shame."                        i Mr. Granme quietly rung the bell. "Tell Owen to put the horses up," he said, "Mr.   l' Fotheringham will stay all night. Now Harrie, when that habit is off we will have tea."            i? Harrie looked up a moment as if half inclined to have her own way, then in her impulsive fashion, started up and swept out of the room. In a few minutes she returned. Evidently Miss Har- rie was as quick in dressing as in all her other movements, and wasted no time at her toilet. Her dress was pretty  and becoming, of the color ladies call "Solfering," which ^ has been so greatly the vogue since "King Victor has Italy's crown on his head." But she wore no ornaments, no head-dress, tassels, or bows, with which young girls -. generally love to encumber themselves. Only a narrow lace collar and delicate sleeves. She went directly up to * a-   j:::!   ATHOL.           53 Mr. Graeme and swept him a profound courtsey. He passed his arm around her waist an'd drew her to his side. "How handsome you are, Harrie," he said with jest- ng flattery. "Nonsense! give me a kiss and let me go." But her cheek burned and her eye looked bright. If she disliked flattery her brother's admiration was evident- y no unpleasant thing. "Now for that tea, children," said Mr. Graeme, and we all gathered around the table. For one moment Har- rie's voice was hushed while Guy reverently implored a blessing. Her seat was next to mine. "I am so glad you are come, Athol," she began in a half whisper while tea was being distributed-"You see I call you Athol at once, and now while I am speaking of it, where upon earth did you pick up that outlandish name? I told sis- ter I should ask you the first thing. Elsie? and who was she? The old nurse-ah!" seeing my eyes fill at the remembrance, " forgive me, dear, I did not know you were so fond of her. In a few weeks you wxill be domesticated, and then you won't mind my random talk," and she gave my hand a little squeeze under the table which set it all right. "Now Athol, tell me, what kind of a travelling compan- ion did John prove? He has always been a sort of a noral Van Amburgh to me, although my travels with him have been confined to the village, as yet." "I throw myself upon your mercy," said Mr. Graeme smiling, and appealing to me. "The quality of mercy is not strained, it droppeth as the gentle dew from Heaven," laughed Harrie, gayly- and then, without waiting for my answer, she rattled on with the greatest volubility: "I did so want to go with John," she said, "I had an     54  (        ATHOL. idea if you saw my face you would be instantly so pre- possessed in my favor you would unite your fortune with ours without a misgiving. And then I wanted to see Derwent. Do you know you have been an utterly myth- ical, incomprehensible character to me all my life; living on a mountain all by yourself, like a juvenile Lady Hes- ter Stanhope. oWasn't it comical? I should have died a thousand deaths." "It was lovely," I said gravely, " and it was-Home." "Did you have a horse? Could you ride?  "Oh! yes, there were fine horses. I rode a little, but I generally walked. I had nowhere to go to but Mr. Craigie's, and the kirk." "The hoise was a' redeeming feature," admitted Hat- tie; "I could exist anywhere this side of the Rocky Mountains I suppose if I had Spit. But did you never go to parties?" "Never." "And you cannot dance?" "Not a step." "I am certain of it," said Harrie-"I should have died! But I shall teach you. You shall know the 'first position' before you are a week older. And what else did you do?" "Study," interrupted Mr. Graeme. "Mr. Craigie told me she was a little prodigy in Latin and Greek." "Don't tell me of it, brother. It will cast a gloom over me for a week. German is bad enough-but there's untold misery in Latin, and depths of woe in Greek. I attempted the alphabet once and I shudder still at the recollection. It makes me think of a fine card of black hooks and eyes to look at the littleiggered up letters." "I shall have you begin Gernan again next week, Harrie," said Mr. Graeme. "I sent away Mr. Schwindon," said Harrie, defiantly,   ATHOL.           55 "I could not endure the atrocious mixture of lager and poor tobacco." "And I will not have your German laid aside, Har- rie." There was a little pause, then Mr. Fotheringham said: "I will teach her if she likes me any better than poor little Schwindan." "Oh! vastly better, Guy! and may Athol take lessons too?  "If she likes." "Indeed I would above all things," I answered, eagerly. "Then," said Mr. Fotheringham, "we will begin whenever you choose. A lesson once or twice a week, Graeme?" "Oh! twice' and-" "It will only be a horrid old hour after all," interrupt- ed Harrie. "The only good part of it is, we can ride over to the village to take the lesson and choose the long- est way home. Heigh ho! John, I am half sorry you came back--I was having an elegant time." And then shle dashed off into a description of her life while John was away, addressing herself to me, while my guardian was talking to Mr. Fotheringham. Mrs. Fleming did not come to table. She was so tired, she said, so she lay upon the sofa listening to us all and ' occasionally joining in the conversation. I saw Mr. Graeme's eye turn toward her more than once with an anxious air. "Are you sure you are well, sister?" he said at last. Her eyes were closed, but she opened them, smilingly nodding assent. But it did not seem to satisfy him. Harrie whispered me with a changed tone: "She has not been strong lately. We hope everything now John is returned. They are so fond of one another."     56          ATHOL.             .i It did not require much penetration to see that. He evidently was not at ease until we left the table and he had taken a low chair by her side. She was lying on the sofa drawn before the hearth. A crimson cushion pil- lowed her head, the flickering fire-light played on her face. He leaned down tenderly and kissed her forehead saying, softly: "Poor Grace, you are so tired." She shook her head and smiled in his face. "Not tired now. All I wanted was John; that must be my rest. Ah! I wonder, my darling, how long home and sister will be pleasant to you." "Forever," he said, in his well-modulated voice. "I do not feel as if I could ever leave you again." She put her arms around his neck, and drew his face down to hers a moment. "My poor restless boy! It is pleasant to hope you will be here with me always. If you only knew how terri- ble and long the days have been!" "I was a brute to stay away," he said. "I am ready to promise you anything to-night, Grace!"a "Then promise me to stay as long as I stay! It will only be a little while!" He stooped quickly, and his face was full of pain, but his only answer was a caress. "Poor boy! poor boy!" she said, as if speaking to a child. "You must know the truth some time-better now-  "Grace, you are no worse?" "No, but some time," she said, slowly, "there must be an end-') " "You are only low-spirited, nervous, and I have tired you out waiting; to-morrow you will be better, tell me truly, Grace-"    ATHOL.          '7 "Yes," she said, with the same smile, "yes, I think I am no worse, onlv'y tired, as you say." He caught at the hope eagerly, his face changed in- stantly. "Ohh, sister, I am so glad! I could not bear it, indeed 1 could not! Her eyes met his steadily. Once or twice she looked ; as if she would speak, but what- she wanted to say she kept within her heart. The fire-light fell full on their two faces, almost equally handsome, and to which their strik- ing resemblance gave an additional charm. She half raised her head and noticing my intent look, called me to come and sit by them. She was going to make room for me on the sofa, but Mr. Graeme said "No," and put a stool for me by her side and at his feet. She had so many ques- tions to ask me about Derwent, she said, and Elsie as well as myself; and in a short time I was talking to her as if I had known her all my life. Gradually the circle widened. First Harrie came over and settled herself on a chair by her brother, leaning her head on his shoulder and taking positive possession of both his hands. Then Alice and Mrs. Fotheringham begged to be also admitted, as Mrs. Fleming laughingly said "she seemed to be the attraction that evening." And so as the conversation became gen- eral, I relapsed into quiet, and while Mr. Greme was re- counting incidents of travel and sights he had seen abroad, I was only too content in the attitude of listener. Mr. Fotheringham, too, had travelled, and there were many points of interest for them to discuss together; but he was quiet and reserved, and had not begun to see as much of the world as my guardian. He was evidently a great favorite with' them all, and I liked him heartily and at once. Alice seemed as content as I to listen, but Harrie 1ri! could not be quiet, and was continually interposing with some humorous anecdote or ludicrous remark. It was a     5 8         ATHOL. delightful evening, and prolonged by all to a late hour. Harrie was the last to say '" good-night." She lingered around as if the idea-of rest were an absurdity to one of her mercurial temperament. At last we all reluctantly ; made a movement to go. I kissed Mrs. Fleming good- night and gave my hand to Mr. Graeme, but though he kissed Alice and Harrie, he only said, "Pleasant dreams petite, you will be quite refreshed by morning." He had never kissed me but once, and that vWas the night of our first meeting. I don't know why I expected it, but I was  disappointed; he had kissed his sisters and not me ; and then suddenly I remembered how short a time I had known him, and I inwardly laughed at my alsurdity. Mr. Fotheringham held the open door for us to pass, and bade us all "good-night," but only Annie and I went out. Alice stopped to say a last few words to him in the hall, so we did not wait. Harrie ran on ahead with the lamp in her hand while I followed more slowly. It was one of those delightfully planned houses, with a large square hall in the centre, and an infinity of irreg- ular odd rooms off, opening one into the other and ex- tending across the front in two broad Wings. These I af- terward learned, Mr. Graeme had himself added, the house being an old one belonging to his father, and where both Alice and Harrie were born. My room was in the right wing and looked charmingly bright to my tired eyes. A small wood fire burned on the hearth, thick warm cur- tains shut out the night. On a little table before the fire burned a shaded lamp, and two large arm chairs seemed to invite a Mtfe-a-tefe. At least Harrie viewed it in that light for she drew one up near mine and seated herself. "What a lovely room," I could not help saying, " and is it mine?" Harrie nodded. "I am glad you like it. It was my choice, and it's a comfortable little nook--besides, it is near   ATHOL.          59 me. You see I had no idea of putting you off company style by yourself in a'big room. We can be as sociable as we like. Our rooms communicate. Then the view from the window is so pleasant." She drew aside the curtain and we both looked out. There was very little to be seen, although it was brilliant moonlight; but it seemed to me the house waks buried in a thick wood, ofily the broad gravelled avenue divided the darkness with a white and glittering seam. "You don't know," began Harrie in a pathetic voice, "how dreary it is in winter. Sister is delicate and never goes out, and Alice can't endure to--which is much the same thing, as you may imagine--and brother vagabond- izing over the world so much I have no suitable escort, for Guy's tastes, as you may suppose, don't lie in that di- rection." "Isn't he fond of company?"I suggested. "Of Alice Hextremely, outside of his pa!:ish-" "His parish? Surely he cannot be a clergyman!"I exclaimed in surprise. "And for pity's sake, what else would you accuse Guy Fotheringham of being?" "And the next presumption is, he and Alice are en- gaged?  "My dear," said Harrie, " the two facts are as old as the hills-fancy Alice in love with anyone else, can you? Now I suppose you see :why I am so melancholy," she went on in her rapid way, "with no one to put a little life into me. I have so hqped we"bcould together stir up the house, and make things alive i "I drew my chair nearer hers- and told her I thought we should agree mightily. She seemed infinitely relieved and rattled on at a very volu- ble rate, with her plans for making things alive, until warn- ed by my sleepy look, which I could ill disguise, of the lateness of the hour.   60          ATHOL. "I declare," she said reluctantly coming to herself, "I am talking you to death, forgetting we have plenty of days ahead. You must be so tired," and she took up her candle; "if you want anything or are lonely in the night, just tap' on this door," stooped down, kissed my forehead and swept out of. the room with her usual rapidity. My little bed looked so inviting, and I was so weary, that almost the instant I laid my head on the pillow I was asleep. At once thankful and content, I slept soundly the whole night. CHAPTER VI. WHEN I awoke it was broad day. How cheerful and bright all within looked to me as I raised my head from the pillow and slowly recalled the events of the night be- fore. The sun was pouring in the windows, which, fa- cing the east, caught the first rosy beams. All nature seemed to rejoice and I awoke to rejoice also; without anxiety for the future or sorrow for the past, I felt I was in a home I would delight in, and under the care of those to whom in one short evening I had given my heart. And then if my first thoughts were given to my cousins, the next was to my new home, as I lay there, very silently making an inventory of everything in the room, my eye at one glance taking in the whole, with a very emphatic liking. A pretty bright carpet with bunches of roses spread on a white ground, covered the floor. The furniture was old- fashioned and covered with a gay striped chintz. Lounge, chairs and easy chair-all alike. The windows were draped with warm, soft curtains. Everything wore a   ATHOL.          6I cheery look, and so did my face, when I rose and looked into the glass. i Cheery, but oh! how plain, when I thought of the lovely, placid Mrs. Fleming, and the bright rosy Harrie. However, I wished to look as well as I could, and spent something like a half hour rummaging my trunk before I decided on a morning dress. At last I selected a blue merino. It was becoming and fitted me to a cliarm. Thus with my indispensable linen collar and cuffs and rmy hair as usual in curls, I soberly came to the conclusions that if I suffered by comparison, I was at least neatly attired. Then I sallied forth; crossing the long and carpeted corridor, I descended the broad staircase to the square hall I had entered the night before. There were so many doors all closed that I hesitated, hardly knowing which might be the breakfast-room. Just then Mr. Grneme came out of one with hat in hand. He did not see me at first, but I ran up to him and saluted him with-- "Good-morning. I thought I was late, so hurried down."  "Oh! you are early," he returned looking at his watch. "I was just going to the knoll to take a look at the old landscape again. If you are not afraid of a little dew, child, come along--but stay "- He brough. me a thick crimson shawl'which he wrapped around Jr y head and shoulders--then held me off at arm's-length for a mo- ment. "That will do.. The little ' Red Riding Hood' again, I declare "--then he abruptly drew me to him. "I haven't said good-morning yet child," and he imprinted a kiss on my forehead. ' We are cousins, you know, nd this sort of thing is allowable," as I blushed'; but he must have seen it was not with displeasure. "Come on, let us go," he said, suddenly dropping my hand; and opening the hall window, or door r ther, which   62          ATHOL. was half glass, we entered a large garden at the back of the house. It was a clear autumn morning. The early sun shone on the crisp browned grass. The dry leaves fell about our path. "Take care," said Mr. Graeme, "to keep on the gravel. It is very wet." I followed him,climbing two or three terraces, which ran up abruptly from the garden, until we reached the top of the hill, or knoll, as Mr. Greme called it. Here we stopped and looked down on the mansion. It was two stories high and built of grey stone, with wide expansive wings, and had an irregular old-fashioned, but comforta- ble look at the back, extending as it did over a consider- able amount of ground. In front stretched the lawn, the lake, the avenue of fine old trees, flaming in gaudy trap- pings of crimson and gold. Then the road was lost down the hill around which we had climbed the night before. Only a small portion of the village could be seen, it was nestled in so under the hills. It was a lovely view. Noth- ing grand or striking as in my own country, but certainly calmly beautiful. A pleasant New England home land- scape. Every feature placid and still. No one would have supposed that long years before this had been one wide battle-field, baptized with blood, blood that had dyed with purple these smiling fields; that the' cruel Indian life had surged madly around, then was hushed and silent forever. And this knoll on which we stood calmly ctn- templating the scene, was one of those old relics of the past which Mr. Graeme had a fancy to preserve undis- turbed, he told me. It was an Indian burial mound, and under the long withered grass slept peacefully the dusky warriors of the tribes that were no more. How changed it was now; so fair, so peaceful, all things -appeared in the light of that bright day! In through   ATHOL.          63 the mountains I caught glimpses of other villages, while in the valley below us, coiling away like a silver serpent, a long waving line widened and trembled. " That is our river," said Mr. Graeme, as I looked at ,   ....him inquiringly. "It is not the sea?"I said with a little grimace. "I never want to see that again." "The sea? Does it look like -it?" he laughed, "oh! ;-:; ,no-it is a harmless little tributary. We think it a charm- ing feature in the landscape; and now, child, tell me how you like your new home. Will it ever take the place of Derwent in your heart?" "I cannot tell," I said evasively, the old love coming back a moment-only a moment-for I did like it al- ready and all within it, and I told him so, whereat he only stroked my hair and smiled. "And that is the village?"I said at length. "Yes, and there is Guy's church," he made answer, indicating the point with his forefinger. I looked and saw a small church with a square tower, about a mile distant. "Yes," I said, " and Harrie surprised me so last night. I did not dream he was a minister." "' Is he so very unclerical then?" "I must confess I know but little of clergymen," I re- turned, "-and ours was. so old and solemn, I thought all ministers must be like him." "But you," said, Mr. Graeme, laughing, " never knew a real live ' Church of England clergyman before! I can tell you, child, only let your principles become known, and Alice will commence an immediate reform! Such a heathen you will seem in her eyes!" and he seemed in- tensely amused at the prospect. "But Mr. Graeme," I said, rather discomfited at as- suming such a character, " is the Church of England any     "         ATHOL,.             i  better than our kirk? I know but little of it myself, but  I thought charity the greatest of Christian virtues."  Mr. Grame only laughed. Provoked with his laughter I went on a little more in- dignantly. "I have been brought up strictly in Elsie's faith and principles, and I am sure if the Church of England is like what we saw in the greRt cathedral in London, it is a very stupid and set affair. If I couldn't say my prayers out loud, and from the heart, I wouldn't sing them!" I spoke with emphasis, for I felt in a very self-right- eous mood, and anything indeed, but a heathen. Mr. Graeme seemed more amused than ever. "Bravo, child! you will do to go with Hugh Miller." "Ah! he is one of our people too," I replied, for I had read Hugh Miller and bore a reverential admiration for my countryman. "And he calls it as I do-' a petri- faction-a stately fossil-and only a fossil " "Well, well, child," he said, subsiding. "I don't pre- tend to analyze forms with you-I know nothing, and care still less about it. I'll give you over to Alice and Guy-my word for it, under their direction the fossil will be all forgotten in a year." "Never!"I returned vehemently, while I ran down the terrace after him and met Alice and Harrie at the door. Both added a kiss with tieir "good-morning"- concluded I was an example as an early riser, and 1I the way to breakfast. It was a large, cheerful room, with high ceilings and oak-panelled walls and queer old wainscoting of the same. A large bay window flooded the room with light, and a hanging basket of flowers, and two canaries completely monopolized the recess. Breakfast was already laid and Mrs. Fleming, apparently much refreshed, was waiting for us, \   ATHOL.          65 And now that it was day, and the glamour of lamp and firelight removed, I discovered she was by no means so young or beautiful as I had thought the night before. That she had been so, there could be no doubt, but sick- ness and disease had made great ravages. Only one thing would always remain the same-the eyes-the won- derful dark eyes, wherein I seemed to read as in the di- vine Book of old of, " that peace which passeth all under- standing." As I passed by her she held out her hand, and stopped me to give me a morning kiss. You are as fresh as a rose, child, and as sweet I know. It is a happy thing to be young." But her tone expressed no regret, only pleasure at seeing me so different from herself. There was some- thing so winning and quiet in all her movements, even to the low, soft voice, that 'most excellent thing in woman,' that I agreed fully with Mr. Graeme-' sister' was all and more even than I had imagined her to be. "Did you rest well?"I asked her as we all gathered around the table, Harrie presiding as by right. "You were so tired, you know." "Oh! yes," she returned, " and you? but I need not ask-that fine rosy color answers for you." Mr. Graeme had drawn his sister's chair to the table, and now as he looked around upon his gathered family, smiled with pleasure. "Grace, this is good," he said, bending upon her a fond look, "better than steaming around the world at the rate I have the last year! After all, a home and family are two great essentials to happiness." ' Now brother John," said Harrie, looking up with a disconsolate face, "don't, I entreat, get in a sentimental mood. I am -terribly afraid," she said, turning to me, "in one of these fits of sentiment he will bring home a fine French wife to crush us all with her airs and graces. It     "          ATHOL, .C has been the bug-bear of my life ever since he got his head so turned with travel-"  "Harrie " and Mr. Grame's voice sounded sharp and quick. I looked up at him, surprised and startled. The color rose to his cheeks and forehead, a red, heavy flush, and his eyes were bright with an angry glow. "That is sufficient," he resumed more coldly. "We need not burden ourselves with useless fears." "Well, did I ever," began Harrie, but her sister's look stopped her. There was evidently something wrong, for Mrs. Flem- ing shared his emotion, and looked restlessly and anx- iously at him from time to time. I felt uneasy. -I could not make him out at all, and it seemed so ill-natured that a few careless, jesting words of Harrie's should be-thus resented. The breakfast passed in grave silence. As for Harrie her exuberant spirits were quite quenched. Gradually Mr. Graeme recovered. He was the first to break the unpleasant silence. "Where is Guy?" he asked, looking around as if he had just missed him. "Gone so early?" c Yes," said Alice, " he preaches this morning and he feared we would be too late with breakfast if he waited, we were all so tired and sat up so late last night. "I declare," said Mr. Graeme, suddenly relapsing into his old manner. "I would like to hear the fellow preach again. What do you say, sister, shall we all go to church?" 'c I never go now," she returned carelessly as if it were not a matter of moment. "It tires me. You must not forget sister is getting old," she said in reply to his anx- ious look, " but the children can go with you."   ATHOL.         67 "What do you say, Athol?" and Mr. Groeme appealed to me. "Do you fancy the idea of a little ride?" '"I don't know about the ride, but I do know I would like very much to hear Mr. Fotheringham." "Then off with you, for the first bell is ringing." And while the rest were lingering over the breakfast I ran to my room and speedily changed my dress, as well as disinterred a bonnet from the depths of my trunk. It did not take me long, and when I passed 'an open dooi on the ground floor, I heard my name called by Mr. Graeme and stopped. "Come in," he said, looking up from his paper. "This you must know is the library; my own- particular and es- pecial retreat. But I will allow you to come here some- times-on good behavior, you understand! A fine place to carry out Mr. Craigie's course of study. That alcove is just the place for your grand old Homer-" "Oh! Mr. Grseme," I said, " it seems so long since I attempted such study. "And do you know,': I lowered my voice as if making a solemn confession, "I don't be- lieve I have half the taste for even the Iliad I used to have. In these few days I feel so completely changed. I don't care to look in a book for years to come." He did not seem -at all shocked with my confession, only told me to be happy. That I knew quite enough of Greek for him. '"You are here, my child, fof life I hope, only make it a happy one and I shall be content. And now whither away?" "Why, to church, you said. Surely you are going?" "I have half a mind to stay at home," lazily puffing his cigar. I demurred. I even went so far as to take it from his lips. Seeing he was not displeased, I went still farther and brought him his hat and gloves. -But still he made no movements to get ready. I was exhausting all my ex-   68          ATHOL.          - pletives upon him and his laziness, when Harrie put her head in the door, and in her positive way, declared we were all going to church, and he should not be so dilatory, and the first Sunday he was home, too! So go he must! At which he puton the hat and gloves I handed him, and declared himself " our humble servant, at a great sac- rifice," pointing to the unfinished cigar, which was smok- ing its life away on the table. Evidently peace was restored between Harrie and her brother, for she was in a jubilant frame of mind. Mr. Graeme, Harrie and I, rode, Alice having walked on a little time before. It was a pleasant, peaceful morning. The sunshine rested softly on the hills, and there was scarcely a sound in nature to mar the perfect repose. I could not help thinking how different this Sabbath was from any I had ever spent before; and my thoughts going back only a few weeks, I found it almost impossible to believe I was the same girl, who, for so many years, had trudged along the rough road every Sabbath by Elsie's side; those soli- tary uneventful days, which went on year after year, with- out the least apparent change. I could not but confess my present condition was much pleasanter. But then perhaps that very sameness prepared me more fully to enjoy this. And then the carriage-thete is certainly some- thing very fine and luxurious in an open carriage, with its crimson cushioned seats, and driver in livery, and I felt quiet consequential and important as we rolled along. I am afraid I liked the pomps and vanities of this life all too well in those childish days, for I liked this mode of going to church amazingly. ?  The village seemed a pretty one, as we rode through. It possessed the usual indispensable town square of all little villages hereabouts; two or three churches, and a hotel, as I found out by reading aloud from a swinging   $i,         ATHOL.          69 sign, which duly set forth that here there was "accommoda- tion for man and beast." Then we passed Alice with her books on her arm, surrounded by a troop of children- all walking to church. We came in late. The organ was sounding low and sweet, as we passed from the bright sunlight into the subdued shadow within. Something of this solemn quiet seemed to stay with me, as we all knelt in the old-fash- ioned pew in stillness of prayer. All, save Mr. Graeme; he bowed his head upon his hands, but it was mere force of habit, the restless eyes were wide open and fastened upon Guy, who knelt like the rest, with covered face and bowed head. It was the second time in my life I had entered a Cath- olic church. Once, in that happy week I had spent with my guardian in London, he had taken me to service in a vast cathedral. Then there were priests and white-robed boys, and solemnly chanted anthems, with the organ roll- ing in tumultuous waves of sound up through the vast arch- es and vaulted roof, until I was stunned and giddy with the mighty reverberations. The ceremonies were impos- ing, but there was an incompleteness in its vastness which struck drearily to my heart. In our simple, plain way we had worshipped in the kirk, sweeping away all ceremo- nies and mysteries, and this sudden change was too great to possess any beauty or worth to me. But it was a dif- ferent thing in this little unassuming village church, grey and still, which I entered for the first time. As the ser- vice proceeded, I could not but secretly acknowledge it beautiful, and I began unconsciously to like the strange worship, so different from the hollow cathedral service I had heard before. I thought all through it what kind of a preacher Mr. Fotheringham would be, and concluded he would be like no one whom I had ever heard before. He read well, but it was his manner more than voice     70          ATHOL.  which pleased me, and his sermon was just like himself, - -the sincere, earnest expression which beamed from his  face, prepared me for it-without intellectual display, yet abounding in strong, clear argument blended with the simplicity and faith of a little child. The service was long, and at its close we waited, until the congregation had dispersed, for Mr. Fotheringham. Mr. Graeme shook hands as warmly With him as if he had not met him the night before.  "You see they brought me here, very much against my inclination I confess," he said, as if his coming need- ed some sort of apology, "but I am right glad I came. You surely will not esteem it mere flattery, when I tell you, you are much improved. And now come home to dinner. Sister expects you." "Yes," he said, "I was coming, but I will walk with Alice." Harrie asserted there was plenty of room for all, but they "preferred walking," at which she rolled up her eyes,  shrugged her shoulders, and gave utterance to "stupid  couple," soito voce to me. Just as we were quitting the church, an elegant open  carriage rolled past us. It was filled with ladies. One, a  fair-haired, fashionably dressed girl, leaned forward, bow- ing and smiling. Mr. Graeme looked at Harrie. "Georgianna Marshton!" he exclaimed in surprise.  "When did she return? I had no idea she was here."  ' They arrived last week, I believe," answered Harrie with her "I don't know and don't care " air.      B "Were they in church?"      : Harrie shrugged her shoulders. "If you had not been so busy talking to Guy, you would have noticed how unusually devout the fair Geor- gianna was. I actually believe she knelt ten consecutive minutes after the benediction was pronounced " ;1"   ATHOL.         71 "For shame, Harrie! If you had been equally devout you would never have seen her." "Who is Miss Marshton?"I asked of Mr. Graeme, but Harrie, as usual, took upon herself the task of replying. "Daughter of Murrey Marshton, of Marshton Lea. Their Royal Highnesses have just returned from abroad, and oh! Athol," she said in her emphatic way, "you should see Georgie! 'Flora McFlimsey, of Madison Square. Just returned from Paris, with nothing'to wear.' Is that the way it goes, brother? If not, it's the idea; at all events, there is no other character suits her as well. But you'll see her. I saw her looking at you as well as John, and my word for it we shall see her soon enough ;" and then she whispered me with a vain attempt at being inaudible- "Next to the fine French wife which seemed to offend John so mightily, I have a holy horror of Georgianna Marshton." I was so afraid he would hear and thereby cause an- other commotion, that I exhausted all my energies in a pinch on her arm, which effectually changed the conver- sation. When we reached home I went directly to my own room until the dinner-bell sounded, and I was carried off to the dining-room by Harrie, who was not in the subdued spirit befitting the day. Mr. Fotheringham's presence -was not the slightest check upon her, and she was so uproariously gay I was quite relieved when dinner was ended. Then Alice and Guy started off for Sunday-school and church again. Mr. Graeme retreated to the library with a cigar, and Harrie declared her intention of taking a nap, while I was left to follow my own "sweet will." Mrs. Fleming had been in her own room since breakfast, not     72          ATHOL. joining us at dinner, so I determined to pay her a visit. I knew where her room was situated. In the right wing, and directly under my own, as Harrie had told me the night before. The hall was very quiet, and I listened for a moment, half afraid of disturbing her. /Then I tapped softly as I opened the door cautiously, for I was afraid she was sleeping. But no; she sat in her large stuffed chair and had apparently been engaged in reading, for an open Bible lay on her lap. When she saw it was I, she smilingly held out her hand in welcome. "Come in, my dear. Your step was so light I fancied it was Alice. She is the only one in the house who does things quietly. You need not close the door. I like the sunshine, it looks so cheerful." So I left it open, with the sunlight flooding through, and took a seat by her side. "I was so lonely, Mrs. Fleming," I said, in half apol- ogy for my intrusion. "Every one has disposed of them- selves for the day; even Harrie has gone to sleep, so I thought if I would not tire or annoy you, I would come down here." "Tire me? Oh, no! You need not fear that. I shall' always be glad to see you," she said, laying her hand on my shoulder and beginning to play with my curls. It seemed to be a frequent habit of hers, caressing word and touch were so habitual to her. You must call me Grace," she said, noticing at once the "Mrs. Fleming " with which I addressed her, "or," as she observed my hesitation, "sister, like the rest, if you choose." I did "choose," for I felt I was too young to call her Grace, and sister was much more proper. And then to me who had never before been offered that privilege, there was something comforting in the phrase so mean-   ATHOL.          73 ingless to many. It seemed to bring this well-beloved sister nearer than ever to my heart. She sat looking at me for a long time silently, then she sighed and I saw the tears slowly filling her eyes. I took her delicate white hand in mine, and kissed it. "hat are you thinking of, dear sister?"I said, using the title she had given me permission to use, with a strange and pleased satisfaction. She gently stroked back my curls as she answered: "You are so like your mother, my love, so very like- it almost seems in looking at you, that the years gone by, were a dream, and I, a child again." "Oh!"I said earnestly, "you knew my mother so well when she was young-tell me-do-all you can of her." She gave me a pitying look. "Poor little birdie-and all you know of her is from Elsie-" "And that was so little. She died so soon after her marriage-- "Yes," she said slowly. "We were brought up to- gether. Her parents were dead-her father and my fa- ther were brothers. For eighteen years we knew no sep- aration, not even in thought. Then she met your father. He was gay and dissipated, but Athol, he was a very handsome man. I do not wonder he attracted her-be- sides, it was her first offer, and she was young. My father forbade the engagement, and for a time they were separ- ated. Then in an evil hour she met him again-and ac- cepted him. She stole from our house .one night. He had a carriage and friends in waiting. They were driven to the nearest church, married, and left for Scotland, and I never saw her again. The same year we removed to America-her death was the first tidings we had of her-- She paused a moment in her recollections, and her eyes were full of tears. 4     74          ATIIOL. "And did she never write you one word? Did she not say good-bye?" "She said 'good-bye ' indeed my love, but I did not know it would be forever. I thought to see her again in a few hours, never dreaming that when we met it would be in eternity," she said softly. "Tell me about it," I whispered. "It seems strange when I think it over, how perfectly I remember that night. She comes before me, as dis- tinctly as if it were yesterday, in her white dress and her long hair falling about her face-such a happy face-not one sign of regret on it, when she stooped over me and kissed me good-night. I was not well and she was going to the house of an intimate friend, to spend the evening, she said. I noticed she looked unusually well, and I laughingly rallied her on her elaborate toilet. 'I am go- ing to seek my fortune,' she said with a gay laugh, and she danced before me with her cloak around her shoulders and begged to know if she looked her very, very best. Suddenly she threw her arms around me-' Gracie dear, good-bye, I do love you, I do love you,+ she said, and she kissed me twice. But when I looked up wonderingly at  this unusual demonstration, she only danced off gayly waving her hand at the door. The next morning we found it all out." "And she never wrote to you even? "There was a letter to my father, but it was sent back unopened, and of course that settled the matter forever. It was not until after her death that I received her last wishes regarding the little child, whom she seemed to have a presentiment she should never see." After a moment's pause she went on: "I loved your mother so much my darling, so very much, that I must first love you for her sake-afterward, I hope for your own. Athol," and her voice was low and tender,   she changed before she died. She was a giddy, thought- less girl, but she became a true Christian. Did you know, my love, that her last thoughts, almost her last words were a prayer for you? That the little one she might never clasp in her arms, if spared, would so live that at the last day, they might be united in the everlasting kingdom- Did you know it, my child? Have you kept your moth- er s prayer in your heart, and tried to live up to those last wishes " I was awed and touched by her strange solemnity, but when she asked me this question in her sweet, grave way, I could hardly restrain my tears. It took but a few more words to break me down entirely, and I buried my face in my hands, and cried like .the very child I was. She gently drew me closer to her. "I would not grieve you for the world," she said; "but, my child, do you never think of all these things?" I laid my head on her shoulder and sobbed out: "No, no! all my life I have never thought-never cared-except once-once I did so long to be a Christian." "Tell me all about it," she said gently dropping her hand among my curls again. Her very voice, low and sweet, calmed me like a spell. It was strange I could weep so at the mention of a moth- er I had never known--but it was her prayer for me that gave me such a bitter sense of unworthiness. Tell me all about it, my love," she asked again. "It was our last day oin board ship," I said, going back in thought to the time. " Mr. Grame and I were talking of the Bible. I don't know how it came about, but he told me he did not believe in it at all. It was the first time in my life I had ever heard it doubted, and I felt within me a longing I cannot describe, to know the way -the right way-that I might, were it ever so feebly, show it to him. But I could not, and did not, and then-'-     76          ATHOL. 4; And then, when you were safe among your friends- safe from the perils of the sea, and well and happy, you forgot all about it-?"     1  And her voice sounded full of pain. "I am afraid I have," I confessed unwillingly. "But you will learn?" she asked softly, "you will never forget your mother's prayers?" I could not trust myself to promise, so I only said, "I would try." I meant it-den, God knows, but such thoughts dwell lightly in the heart of youth. She did not answer, only pressed me to her, and was silent for some time. At last I felt her tears slowly drop- ping on my face. I looked up. "Tears? dear sister, they are not for me?" She shook her head mournfully. "Athol," she said, "I remember the time when we were children together-John and I. He always looked up to me then--always was guided by me, poor boy! I had to be his mother-sister-his all and in all-and i[ in those days I had been different myself, all might still have been well with him. But I was young and thought- less. I gave more heed to the world than my God. I made myself idols-mnd He took them away. It was not until long years after I came to myself and saw how vile and sinful I was in His sight-but then-oh! Athol, it was too late." There was a mournful earnestness in her voice as she said those words)/hich have been a knell to many a heart -many a weary time-too late! ! The sun was setting gorgeously. The room was full of golden glory. I sat looking at her face without reply- ing; that face which in the falling sunset seemed to me so heavenly. After a pause she said-: "I pray to God it may not be so always, indeed   ATHOL.          " the hope is almost trust.   It may be when I am gone-- A shadow darkened her face. I looked up. Mr. Graeme was by her side. He must have heard her last words, for he. bent over her chair and as he kissed her, I heard him say- "Oh! Grace, you are almost an angel." "Hush!" she said, "John, I, who have failed so sig- nally? Oh! John, John, your praise is more wounding than your reproach " He leaned upon the arm of her chair a moment si- lently thinking. At last he said: "There is more religion in you and Guy than in all the rites and ceremonies, ministers, and congregations, that were ever put together-and yet-and yet-dear sis- ter, don't you know even Thomas would not believe until he put his hand in the prints of the nails? Morally speak- il  ing, this is impossible-spiritually it is not-I want to lay my hand on something tangible; something that stands out boldly and indisputably, that I must acknowledge comes direct from God. What more do you ask than  that?" She pointed to where the sun had gone down, trailing long flashes of rose and flame through the purpling twi- light. It was so grand-so God given-who could doubt? He looked a moment, then walked away. Presently we heard him playing softly in the next room. The door was open, so we sat still and listened; listened in the twilight hush without speaking, for we were both too busy with our thoughts. At length he looked in upon us again- "What shall I sing for you, Grace-anything?" "Anything you like. Some of those old hymns I used to love-do you remember?" He returned again to his music. She leaned back in     78          ATHOL. her chair, with one hand over her eyes, the other resting on my head, while he sang in a rich, harmonious voice, all those beautiful hymns which linger around the heart like old memories. "Brattle Street,"St. Martin's," and grand "Old Hundred." I seemed to hear them again, as I heard them long ago, in the Scottish kirk, as a child. His playing was as irregular and unsettled as his mind. Sometimes he sang plaintive, quaint psalms-psalms that the covenanters sang in fearful. days long past-then .he would suddenly change to some sweet modern air, a ves- per hymn, or chant. At last he struck a full free chord in the bass, and began that grand old Latin hymn, "Dies Irae, Dies Illa," than which there is no more beautiful one extant. He sang it all the way through, and when it was end- ed closed the piano, and returned to his sister's side. "You were always so fond of that, you know," he said, taking her hand from her face and kissing her forehead. "It brings back old times, doesn't it, Grace?" "Wasn't it Christopher North who said, 'Blessed be the memory of old tunes forever?' and indeed they are blessed. It takes me back years ago, to the very time I was telling Athol of to-night, John-when we were young-" "Grace," said Mr. Gramme abruptly, "I told you last night I should never leave home again; I never shall, I will stay here and let you do with me as you will-if only you can make me like yourself. Home is so sweet, isn't it, child?" He turned my face up toward his, but he could not see the joyful look it wore; a blessed home; a never- ending repose and peace; and I thought if all days were to be like this I should be happy indeed. Gradually the conversation changed. Mrs. Fleming liked to lie back in her chair and rest, while we talked. I was telling her all the little minute things which helped   &WI    ATHOL.              79 to make up my life at Derwent, whet Harrie surprised us by coming in to say that tea was waiting. She was great- ly refreshed by her sleep, and by her nonsense effectually broke up the sober train of thought we had indulged in. Her gayety was infectious, and we passed an evening that ended all too quickly. When I went up to my own room that night I could not but thank God out of the fulness of my heart for this happy home he had given me-for this dear sister who had bestowed on me already so much sweet counsel and love, and last, but oh! not least, my handsome, gifted guardian  CHAPTER VII.   IT did not take me many days to feel perfectly at home with them at the Dell. I liked every one of them, from X  sister down to the merry, wilful, utterly insubordinate Harrie. We of course fraternized, being so nearly of the same age. I also made friends with my guardian's two i  -beautiful setters; visited the stables, and admired Spit- fire, to Harrie's great satisfaction, and with her for guide soon became acquainted with every nook and corner of the old house, as well as the woods which encircled it. There are nowhere more beautiful hills, valleys, and mountain streams, than may be found in and around the long chain of undulating Berkshire hills; and I was not long in discovering their beauties. With Harrie, and the two dogs bounding after, I climbed the boldly hewn rocks which ran up steeply back of the house. I followed all the intricate windings of the little brook that fretted its way in and out among marsh and fallow. -I traversed all I      80          ATHOL. the pretty foot-paths round about the place, and soon dis-  covered where the most picturesque views were to be obtained. Like all country villages, this also had its famous sights, its-drives, its lake, its pleasant picnicing ground. But the grandest excursion of all, Harrie told .me, was to the "Mountain ;" they claiming plenty of hills but only one ver- itable "Mountain." An excursion was proposed the very day after my arrival, but Mr. Groeme thought it almost too late in the season to attempt it, and it was deferred until some warm, bright day should occur. And within, I found all as pleasant as without. Brookdell was not one of those places one merely reads of in books, where, because one is not obliged to foot the bills, and has a blank check to draw on the imagination, one generally runs riot in ex- travagance. But Brookdell being a real, veritable, sub- stantial home, and John Graeme, its master, a thinking, clear-headed man, everything was necessarily well-con- ducted and comfortable, without any superfluities or un- due elegance. There was no picture gallery, like the stiff old hall at Derwent, no music room or boudoir for any of us, only, in a sort of salon adjoining sister's room, were gathered together all Mr. Graie's extravagances of years past. The windows were long, opening like doors on a side veranda, which in summer would be delightful. The room was not large enough to be stately and not too small for comfort. It was just cozy and elegant. The walls were covered with pictures; pictures which Mr. Greme had chosen and brought from abroad at various times, mostly landscapes of places and scenes with which, at some time in his life, he ha:d been familiar. I was never so happy as when he was describing them to me, but the ones I liked above all others were the glowing pasture lands and dewy meadows of early morning, charming bits of color, or looking, as I always. thought, as'if the c   ,  ATrHOL.         81 sunlight were glowing red hot and piercing behind can- vas and color, permeating the whole. They were none of them originals. Mr. Graeme had too. much good sense to claim that, but was proud and fond of them in that they were such perfect copies. He had more "Claudes" than anything else, and-I thanked heaven inwardly-not a Ma- donna in the lot! I knew his opinion of them in general, 'and I always had a holy horror of them myself, which was not lessened by our picture-hunting in London. Mr. Groeme had taken me while there to a celebrated gallery, : where, among much that was perfect and beautiful, I was shown one, which to my untutored mind, savored somewhat of the absurd. It was painted by a grand artist, Mr. Graeme said; but this highest type of all that is saintly and perfect in womain; this embodiment of holi- ness and modesty was invested in a "Pompadour " gown, with her hair rolled back, d la Marie Stuart, a good sized, rollicking baby in her arms, with about as much spirituality as a Bologna sausage, and an open book in her hand from which she had been apparently reading. The last new novel, most likely---such things were un- doubtedly en regle in that advanced age of progress! Faugh! I had a little print of the "Mater Dolorosa" which I would not have exchanged for it for anything. It is only when the tender, tear-stained eyes of the weeping mother meet mine I can feel any of that emotion and pitying love which ought to reign in every heart at the mere mention of her name. So Mr. Graeme evidently thought when he made up his collection, for he ignored the spiritual, and revelled in the most fanciful bits of coloring I had ever seen. Then there was a curious little Indian cabinet, with enamelled panels of grotesque and absurd images, and in it were piled portfolios of sketches-in pencil and crayon-most of them he made himself-and John Graeme, like the gen- 4*     82          ATHOL. erality of men who wander around the world, with no settled business, a full purse, and fine appreciation of art, did this sort of thing well. I could always tell his broad, free pencil, and I dreamed a good many dreams over them, setting him down invariably in my own mind as one of the most brilliant geniuses the world ever pro- duced. Then there were choice little bits of marqueterie, a Louis Quartoze cabinet, a wonderful buhl clock wherein a wonderful bird discoursed some equally wonderful mu- sic, and a man with a scythe who mowed down the hours as they passed. There were also a few fine Etruscan speci- mens, one or two marbles, Chinese and Indian puzzles, idols, choice Arab coins, and a tall case of minerals in one corner which caused me to break the tenth commandment, every time my eyes rested on it. These, with a superb grand piano made up the extravagances of the master, and in utter contradistinction to all this, the furniture was at once old-fashioned and plain. The lounges and chairs were comfortable, even 'luxurious, in their cushioned depths, but covered with an old, time-gone-by flowered covering, looking, in my poor opinion, decidedly out of place. But Mr. Graeme never would allow any alterations. 4t was his father's room and he willed it to remain the same way, only he added the beauties with a lavish hand. And a charming place it was. We were never afraid to go in here. The carpet was not too fine to tread on. The ruddy grate fire always sparkled a welcome, and sister, if she did not lie on the old-fashioned lounge before its cheery gleam, was in her own room with the door open, within sound of our voices. Here it was we would gather for our informal little teas, which Harrie insisted was so much more cozy than sitting in state around a big table-and Harrie's wishes were law, I soon found out-or had been in her brother's absence. I saw but little of the latter individual the first week of my stay at the Dell. A-   i::3H            ATHOL.           83 He went to his library directly after breakfast and there he remained. Nearly all the time occupied with busi- ness, I suppose. The scent of a cigar was sometimes wafted to us from the crevice of the door, but he 'never showed himself until dinner time. At that meal and for the rest of the evening he abandoned himself as com- pletely to our whims and pleasure, as he had, in the morn- ing, to business. A   We had been passing for three or four days through what people were pleased to style an "equinoctial," and as our out-door amusements were suspended for a time, .. : we found our pleasure and comfort within. During the  day we amused ourselves with reading or sewing, gener- 4:-- ally congregating in sister's room where the hours always passed rapidly, until the bell sounded for our five o'clock dinner, and my guardian punctually made his appearance. i  IIn the evening we adjourned to "John's Museum," as Har- rie called it, and what a dear, delightful old gathering- place for the family it was, to be sure. And after our so- cial cup of tea we would enjoy a round game, or Mr. Grame would take down a favorite volume from the bookcase and give us a, scene from Shakspeare, a lofty passage from  Milton, or a page of Tennyson. Or he would open the grand piano and sing us songs as in- finite in their variety as his mood; then he almost always ended' with a gay "Galop" or "Polka," while Harrie, true to her promise, taught me the steps, and scarcely waiting for me to learn, would whirl me after her in the maddest possible fashion. We were very happy, all by ourselves, and. Mr. Graeme seemed to delight in do- ing all he could to add to that happiness; and in those few stormy days we were drawn nearer than ever to one another. Sister was very feeble, and confined almost en- tirely to her lounge, or easy chair; but she always entered smilingly into all our pleasant plans and talk, and we u              1     84          ATHOL. were as much at ease as if we had always formed one family. One night while the storm was raging without, and "we four, andno more," subdued into quiet, sat around the blazing fire, Mrs. Fleming broke the long silence by inquiring " if any one knew where John had gone, or if he had returned." "Gone?" said Harrie, looking up suddenly. "Not on Hector?  "Yes, two or three hours ago--directly after dinner," said Alice, "I saw him myself." Harrie wrung her hands with the air of a tragedy queen.    l "To see Georgianna Marshton, I know. I shall go at once and inquire." "Do nothing of the kind," said Mrs. Fleming. "If your brother takes pleasure in her society that is enough. As if he should have any deeper motive than pleasure, silly child!" "I have a vivid conception of a sister-in-law," said Harrie, with a comic look of woe. "Nonsense! you are the most absurd child I ever saw. You will be the very one to put it in his head if you do not look out," said Alice in an amused tone, The clock chiming eight brought John to mind again.! "Pray Athol," asked sister, " go to the library and see if he has returned." I obeyed, and while Harrie ordered tea brought in, I felt my way along the dark passage and reached his door. It was ajar and a light burning within. I knocked once or twice, and receiving no answer, gently pushed it open and looked in. Mr. Graeme was lying on the sofa, his hat, gloves and riding-whip were by his side. His face looked flushed and happy. He lay back on the sofa, his eyes   :/3Z         ATHOL.          85 fixed on vacancy, absorbed in smiling reverie, he did not see me until I stood by his side. "Mr. Greme-" Xd He sprang up quickly. "Sister sent me to say tea was waiting." "Tea?" he said. "By Jove! I had forgotten all -;:J  about it. Run back, and I'll come in a moment." He spoke as he would to a child, a servant even, with- out taking the trouble to say another word, and a sharp jealous pang, something akin to Harrie's fear, went through my heart. He has been to see Miss Marshton, I thought, therefore he does not care for me, has not even a word to say to me, though I have not seen him all day; and I turned slowly back and rejoined the others. "Have you seen a ghost, Athol?" said Harrie, look- ing up from her task of lighting the lamp, "that you look so solemn?" I did not think it necessary to answer such a question, so I brought a stool over to Mrs. Fleming's side. "I found him in the library, and he will be here directly," I said, seating myself by her, and just that in- stant in he came. As was his custom, he went up to the couch and kissed his sister the first thing. In doing this he had to bend over my head. He had not seen me until then. "What a demure little p uss it is to-night," he said: "what ails it?" and he turned my face up to meet his, and gave me a careless kiss., The action caused an immediate reaction. All I wanted was the little attention which, as he had already begun to give me, I felt my heart would ever after claim. "John," said Harrie, in her blunt fashion, " have you been to see Miss Marshton? I am dying to know." He threw back his head with a motion that was habit- ual to him, and gave a light laugh.     86          ATHOL. "What a jealous household I have! Only look at this child with a face solemn as a judge, and you, little inquis- itor, with your positive ways and positive questions, assail me the first thing; well, I will settle this matter at once  yes, I have been to see Miss Marshton." "What upon earth did you find to talk about all those two long hours?" ' Two hours, was it? Two minutes rather! Well, I read to her part of the time." "Read! In what?" "Evangeline." They all gave a hearty laugh at Harrie's stunned look; but I, never having even heard of Evangeline, could not guess what the laugh was about. "Well, I have nothing to say," said Harrie after a long pause, " to all these confessions, but pronounce your sen- tenced: You must read Evangeline to us to-night." "Very well. I will accept the sentence as just, and Harrie, you go and look it out while I take my cup of tea; ' and he brought it over to sister, dislodging me from the stool at her side and occupying it himself. He seemed in exuberant spirits, laughing and talking until Harrie returned with the volume in her hand, and the tray was removed. Alice took her embroidery and sat down in a low chair by the table.. The lamp light fell softly on her brown hair. She looked almost pretty in her quiet womanly fashion, while Harrie, who declared she had spasmodic fits of industry, took up her crocheting and darted her needle in and out amidst the fiery silk and glittering beads, as rapidly as she did everything else. Sister kept her old place and I took the stool Mr. Graeme had vacated. The soft light of the lamps, and the closely drawn curtains were a great contrast to the storm without. Perhaps we all felt it, for Mr. Grame remarked as he   ATHOL. .          87 took the large easy chair, " it is a cozy little family after all,"-then began to read. I suppose everybody lnows that sweetest of all Long- fellow's poems, except, indeed, such a dunce as I, who knew nothing of American literature. The very begin- ning, fresh and sweet, claimed my instant attention: "This is the forest primeval. The murmuring pines and the hemlocks, Bearded with moss, and in garments green, indistinct in the twilight, Stand like Druids of old, with voices sad and prophetic, Stand like harpers hoar, with beards that rest on their bosoms. Loud from its rocky caverns, the deep voiced neighboring ocean Speaks, and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest." I said before, Mr. Graeme read well, and he also was ti-a: quite aware of the fact. But that night he surpassed him- self, which was evidence enough he appreciated the poem. I too liked it. There was a wondrous witchery about this quaint, sweet story, which to me was irresistible. At first, as I listened, it was like a low, sweet wind, murmur- ing softly and musically as in its own native "forest pri- meval"-now swelling into rapture, now dying away in a tremulous pathos that leaves the heart moved and troubled with fond regret. But as it goes on it is no soft, sigh- ing zephyr-it is a blast, clear and strong as the mighty blasts of winter, and desolating as the wind which sighs over the valleys of the dead. I think in this poem we gain something like a glimpse into the poet's heart, for one to portray the power of affec- tion so keenly and well, must feel it in all its intensity be- fore he can so express it.  Evangeline, loving and beloved, calm in her religion and happy in her home, then wandering and outcast, ban- ished from friends and Gabriel, then the life-long, weary search, ending at last in death, followed each other in every varying interest and succession. The death of     88          ATHOL. Gabriel closed the scene, and as he read the last sweet lines- "All was ended now, the hope, and the fear, and the sorrow, All the aching of heart, the restless, unsatisfied longing, All the dull, deep pain, and constant anguish of patience! And, as she pressed once more the lifeless head to her bosom, Meekly she bowed her own and murmured "Father, I thank thee!" Something of the might and power of such great love, hoping all things, bearing all and overcoming all things, stilled us into perfect silence. John's reading was like Evangeline's step. "When it had passed it seemed like the ceasing of exquisite music." Like the unbroken melody of some old song, dying away sweetly and gently, even as Gabriel died. Sitting where I sat, in perfect shadow, I could watch my guardian without his perceiving me. His eyes had a light and softness unusual to them, almost like the mild effluence which came from the tranquil eyes of Grace. His face wore an expression I had never seen there before. Was it this great and mighty love of which he had been reading that moved him so? I could not but wonder as I gazed, whether that was the tone, that the look he wore, when reading Evangeline to Miss Marsh- ton. I almost hated her name when I looked at him. Why should she step between us and this happy home? My heart individually cried out; it could not and would not-spare this love. "Well," said Harrie at length, with a relieved sigh- breaking the long silence, "I hate that story! I don't care what anybody else thinks of it-and for Mr. Long- fellow, a respectable married man, to wind up affairs like that, is too abominable. I should think from his own experience he would have had them married decently, and like other folks!"   ; )- -ATHOL.                  89 Mr. Groeme laughed. "Harrie," I said, for I had been listening under my breath and could not bear such sacrilegious words, "you spoil it all! I believe it is not a single solitary in- stance of woman's devotion and self-sacrifice. Be as matter of fact as you choose, but I believe, and always shall, such love exists in the world as well as in books." "Of course you do!" giving her head a lively toss, "with your brain brimful of romance as it ever can be! How upon earth such a very respectable old gentleman as Mr. Craigie contrived to manage you is a mystery! :fi- I Brother John, here you have been holding her up as a marvel in Latin and Greek, I believe all the time it was The Children of the Abbey,' and ' Abelard and Heloise;' don't tell me,' and she settled down into instant con- viction. "I think," said Mrs. Fleming in her sweet serious way, "I must take Athol's part. I think I know what you mean, don't I, my love? That without any foolish ro- mance or sentiment, a woman can, and does love as deeply as Evangeline-that loving once with her full wo- man's nature it is not possible for her either to forget or love again-that with this strong shield ever around her she can meet safely all the trials of this life-even death, face to face as Evangeline did, with 'Father, I thank thee. " "I think I know one such," said Alice, looking re- proachfully at Harrie and then at Mrs. Fleming, who lay back with closed eyes and sweet, firm lips, as if she, too, like Evangeline, had passed through this great suffering and yet with her could say, "Father, I thank thee." "We do not speak," said Mr. Graeme, answering Alice's look of reproach, " of any one in this little world of home; but in the great wide world and now-a-days,     90          ATHOL. is there any modern fashionable woman you know in real life who can love like that?" "Yes," said Alice, "half of the hum-drum, plain, un- assuming wives one meets and never by any possibility thinks capable of anything, are just as self-sacrificing- just as enduring, every day of their apparently hum- drum lives." "Yes," said Mrs. Fleming, "perhaps it lies deeper than the surface. If we could gaze into each heart, we might find there hidden from the careless eye, a love sur- passing even this we have read of-one that would do and dare all things, even to a life-long search for the well-be- loved. I want to think it of all, for it is a pure and holy thing to love as did these two-a love, that ending in this world, is, God be thanked, only continued and perfected in the next." "Then you rather like it than otherwise," said Harrie in a dejected tone, "that they had such a fearful time of it and weren't married respectably after all?" "What a poetess you'd make, Harrie," laughed her brother, "you would give us the other side of the ques- tion. Love, versus matrimony." "No!" she returned- indignantly, "Love-versus- common sense!" "Well, I am glad to have heard it," I said; "I had no idea of American poets, except from a very poorly ex- pressed and one-sided criticism by one of our reviewers, and that said there was but one true poet in America." "Indeed?" said Harrie contemptuously. "And pray who might that honored one be?" "Emerson." "Oh! I know," she retorted disdainfully, "and it con- tained also a little impudent assertion, which one might know came direct from John Bull, where we are repre- sented as 'leaning heavily and insolently on the arm of a   1a             ATHOL.          91 superior-reminding one of an upstart' etc., etc., faugh! Thank God I was born in Massachusetts! The land of poets--true poets--'too numerous to mention'-as I used to say in my compositions." "Yes, but some df us were born in England," said my guardian. "Then it was their misfortune, not their fault," she re- turned promptly, "it was not New England." "Oh!" he said, laughingly, "I'll give you up! real Massachusetts blue!" "And true as blue," she retorted, for Harrie Graeme was only a woman, and always believed in having the last word. "I suppose," said Alice after a pause, during which Harrie was making as desperate lunges with her crochet needle, as if it were a sword, and she were aiming at the heart of Great Britain, "I suppose, with your extremely matter-of-fact ideas, you believe entirely in second mar- riages?" "Well-yes-" answered Harrie, "I think I do. If sister's ideas of love extending to the other world were true, there would be a pretty lively congregation of Brig- ham Youngs to settle up accounts hereafter! But as I don't believe in such doctrine, I can't say I exactly dis- approve of second marriages." "But Whittier does," said Mr. Greme. "Does any- body remember his 'Old wife and the New?" "I do," answered Alice, "I never could forget it-it would haunt me I think." "Repeat it," I said, "Alice, do. I would love to hear it." So she began. It is a fanciful little thing, running all over with rich, poetic thought, and commended itself to my heart at once, as I always had a holy horror of men forgetful of their first vows. The cold spectre of the forgotten first wife is supposed to visit at night the     92            ATHOL. bedside of the sleeping second, withdrawing with her  ice-cold hand, "Love's fair gift of gold and gems,"      i and then follow such lines as these: "In his arms the strong man folds her, Closer to his breast he holds her, Trembling limbs his own are meeting, And he feels her heart's quick beating; Nay, my dearest, why this fear? Hush! she said, the dead are here. Nay, a dream, an idle dream, But before the lamp's pale gleam Tremblingly her hands she raises,  There no more the diamond blazes, Clasp of pearl, or ring of gold, Ah! she sighs, her hands are cold." "Heavens!" said Harrie, "I would rather have Mr.     I Bayhem Badger and his very proper pride of his wives, 'first and second.' Stop, Alice, I shall not hear another word." Of course Alice stopped. "I shall not sleep a wink to-night, Alice," she went on, "and you are to blame-and what sort of good are all these ridiculous fancies-only to waken us in the night with a fear of such ice-cold hands. I know I shall not sleep a wink, shall you, brother John?" I sat in my old place, keeping the same watch of my guardian's face, and I saw such a storm of passion and wild regret sweep over it, that I remained mute and trans- fixed at the sudden change. But even as I looked the shadow passed. If there was anything to wound in aught his sister had said, it was not noticed by a word. Even her question was unanswered until twice repeated. "What is it, Harrie?" he asked at length, starting in   ATHOL.          93 surprise. "Sleep? To be sure I shall. We have none of us such cold hands to fear. I thought you were too practical to be disturbed by such fanciful whims. But now if we do not want to see the ghost of the morning's dawn we must away to bed."  He spoke playfully, but I thought, as the red glow of the firelight struck his face, he looked rather pale, and the careless, happy smile he had worn was gone. After I went to my room that night, I sat by the fire, thinking what an incomprehensible, inconsistent creature a man was, when Harrie put her head in the door. "Not in bed yet?" she said. "I opened the door without rapping, for I thought you might be asleep." i   She came over by the hearth and leaned her head on the mantel in a thoughtful way. She was silent unusually long for her, so I looked up inquiringly with ' a penny for your thoughts." You don't know," she began--then suddenly stopped. "Of course I don't unless you tell me." "I want to talk to somebody," she said in her abrupt way not noticing my remark," and it must be you, I sup- pose. As for going to sister I wouldn't dare, and Alice would only open her blue eyes a little wider and say "Harrie Groeme " in her mild remonstrative way, and that would be the end of it. So will you be my confidante?" "What upon earth are you going to tell me?"I said, thoroughly roused, for she looked as if she had been com- mitting a crime. "Nothing very serious that you need look at me so- nothing that will weigh very heavily upon your conscience. But tell me-can you keep a secret?" "Yes," unhesitatingly. "You see I have so little to tell." "I am willing to take as little or as much as you choose to give me." b     "         ATHOL.  "Oh! I will tell you all I know myself," she returned frankly, "but it is more than half suspicion." She took a chair and drew it close to mine. "It is only about brother," settlingherself as for a long story, "and to have I you understand more readily how 1 feel, I must go back soime years. You know he has not always lived here with us. After he left Heidelberg he came over to see sister. Father was alive then, and they did not agree about some matters. What they were I never knew distinctly, but he went abroad again, very much to sister's sorrow-for she' had brought him up more like a mother than sister,-and  until he went to the University they were never separated.  Well-I think he went to Paris, for occasionally I would  see sister's letters and they were almost all stamped  ' 'Paris' on the envelopes, though she used to tell some-  times of his being in other places. We children never used to hear from him, for we were almost strangers. Well-so it went on for a number of years until my-father - died. Somehow I fancy the disagreement was because John was wild and led an unsettled life, which was father's horror. However, he must have felt he could trust him, for when he died, everything-houses, lands, even children were solemnly bequeathed to his care. Then John came back. But oh! Athol, if you had seen him then, you would not know him now. It might have been father's death, but I thought then and do still, it was some grief nearer to his heart than even that, which had caused such a change. You know all I remembered of him was a frolicsome, light-hearted, handsome young man, who never tired of amusing Alice and me, and who encouraged us to fill the house with the most boisterous merriment. I had expected and hoped so much in his coming back, and he was so changed I hardly knew him. He would closet himself with sister the whole day, scarcely noticing us when we met him; and so grave and taciturn, it was   ATHOL.          95 really a relief when he left us and locked himself in his own room. He scarcely looked at me, although I was the pet, as sister and Alice always called me." "How old were you?"I asked, as she paused in her recollections. "Oh! old enough to think of and dread boarding-school, and sister was determined I should go. I couldn't bear to leave home and I made up my mind I would not. So one day I summoned up courage to visit his library un- asked-a place I was never allowed to enter-but go I did and entreated him to grant me this one petition. At first he seemed angry at!ny presumption, but when I cried and begged him not to send me away from home and put me among strangers, where I would never be petted as my poor father and sisters had petted me, it seemed to melt the ice between us at once. He took me in his arms and called me his poor little child, and said he would thence- forward take a father's place to me, and I might never leave home if I wanted to stay. So stay I did, and from that day became a privileged person. I went in and out of his study without permission or fear of intruding. Some- times he taught me himself-engaged me the very mas- ters I wanted, and humored and spoiled me to my heart's content. And as time passed, John gradually emerged from his shell. To us at home he unbent even more than to strangers; until at length he became what you see him, one of the dearest, best and yet most incomprehensible of brothers. I spoke once to sister about it when John was abroad, for he was wandering around the world a good deal, but she did not seem to like to talk about it, and only said he had seen a great deal of trouble and needed all our love and care." "What is all this long story about?"I inter- rupted. "Where does the secret so important come in?"     96          ATHOL.  "You hurry me up so," said Harrie, "and I always K like to tell things my own way. However, as I said be- fore, brother gave me the run of the library, so I was in  and out at all hours. As I was a very good accountant I used to help him sometimes when he had a great deal to do, and one day when he was gone to the village and left me to copy a deed, I fell to rummaging an old desk and I there came across an old black case. It was fas- tened with a spring, but I managed to open it and in it--  oh! Athol-I found the loveliest face. Just such a face as you'd go crazy over, I know!" "A man?"I said, becoming interested at this stage of her story. "No!" with disdain, "a woman-a young girl-such eyes! such lovely hair, and such a grand, queen-like head! It was a miniature, exquisitely painted, set in gold and surrounded with brilliants: on the back, in small letters, were the words, Sans varier, Adele Paris, July, I8-.' I only trusted myself with one look, for I was afraid brother might come and I knew he would be angry; but I did not forget the beautiful face. I stole to the desk several times afterward, but I somehow lacked the courage to open the little case again. It seemed so like meddling with a secret  of John's which I never coulddlare unravel. Sometimes  I have thought it was an old love of his who perhaps had  jilted him, and this caused his melancholy for so many years--though as a general rule I am principled against such beliefs as regards the men-but then John is an ex- ception to almost all established rules, and he might mourn for even a woman; and I have thought so since, for did you notice Sunday how angry he was when I mentioned the fine French wife? I never thought until I had spoken, for it was so long ago; but I do believe, Athol, it was so. I think he has entirely gotten over it if such were the case, and probably feels only anger and mortification that he   ATHOL.          97 had been so duped. This is the great secret, which, after all, is not such a momentous one. You are the first person I have ever told it to, however, and I don't know that I should even have done so now, but I am tormented with the fear that this trouble-having blown over, Georgianna Marshton with her intolerable airs and graces, will catch him in the same snare. "How long have you had this fear?"I asked in a vain effort to speak carelessly and unconcernedly; for although a miniature dated so many years back was not of much con- sequence, this living reality we had to contend with I could not feel so certain about. "How long? Oh, before the Marshtons went abroad. And then, I believe they met accidentally somewhere on the continent and travelled together. At any rate, there has always been a great intimacy, and it has begun again. You will see if I am not right. I know John, and he will be there every day from this time forth. This comes of reading poetry and fol-de-rol to every girl one meets." I only said, "Yes!" and folding my hands on my knees watched very intently the bright wood fire while Harrie went on. "Mrs. Marshton is only too anxious for such an event, having several other daughters about ready to come upon the stage, as any one but John could see with half an eye, And why shouldn't she be, I should like to know? There isn't such another chance in the whole country around. a I would not care," she said after a long pause, "if it was to any one laying the slightest claim to the thing called a heart. But there's no use talking to John and giving him warning. If he did not get villanously angry, which he's more than likely to do, he would throw back his head and laugh in that tantalizing way of his, without saying a word-which always enrages me beyond all bounds-and the next thing to see would be Hector taking Mr. John 5     98          ATHOL.             f Graeme the nearest road to Marshton Lea, while one would  have the melancholy satisfaction of feeling they had put the very idea in his head they had been trying to drive OUt."  "I should think such a person as you say she is, would be the very last one Mr. Graeme would fancy." "Oh, you don't know the men," said Harrie disdain- fully. "She is so beautiful, too-even I, who have always detested her, must acknowledge that-besides, she is not so utterly devoid of brain as most beauties are. She is accomplished, has travelled both at home and abroad, and is altogether that creature I despise-a thorough woman of the world, although she is only a few years older than Alice; But I know her to be a heartless, vain girl-ambi- tion her guiding star, and John Grxme the prize she hopes to win." "Harrie," I said, "don't let us sit up all night puzzling our brains over such possibilities, 'sufficient for the day,'  etc., you know the rest, and so good-night."  "Good-night," she returned, rather despondingly. "I  couldn't have expected you to sympathize with me, after  all; but remember, this is in strict confidence "  " I nodded my head as she disappeared, and smiled to  myself at my lack of sympathy!

My heart gave a quick, hard throb when I thought over all these things on my sleepless pillow. And then the picture of the beautiful Adele. My brain grew feverish and impatient at this strange mystery, and refused to entertain aught else than the tormenting thought of John's past and present love.   ATHOL.          99 Strangely confused at last these thoughts became, until they ended in heavy sleep. I never woke until it was broad day, and the sun, pour- ing through the window, struck my eyes. Then I heard Harrie's voice calling cheerfully, "the storm is over and we can go and ride." She had forgotten all about her dejection of the night before. So had I. to *    CHAPTER VIII. HARRIE was right. The storm was over and we had again a pleasant autumn day. She declared she was dying ofennui, and Spit would be utterly ruined with idleness and excess of oats, so ride we must. The morning air was chill, but fragrant. The rain clouds, which for so many days had hung over us heavy and close, were all dispersed, and the sky was blue and clear. I ran up to my room with delight to get ready, but a difficulty presented itself. I had no dress. But "where there's a will there's a way," and I soon found a way to surmount this, which, like all other difficulties, proved the truth of the old adage; and while Harrie was prowling around disconsolately, through every closet and wardrobe, I began altering my travelling dress to the requisite length by letting out the merino which the prudent Elsie had turned in against a future day of need. It was arranged in a short time, and with a duplicate hat of Harrie's, I was quite presentable. I was standing on the porch, talking to sister and Alice, who had come out to see us mount, when Mr. Grzeme came around the drive, on his superb black horse. Harrie clapped her hands.      "' Brother John, are you going too?" He nodded assent. "I couldn't trust two such girls with two such horses, you know." '"And where are we going? Up the mountain?" O,you  like, and it is not too far, too muddy, too any other objection or interposition of Provi- dence.  t ' Oh thol, this is splendid!" said Harrie in a jubi- lant ton/e.!" it is the loveliest ride!"She sprang on her horse While she spoke. Mr. Grame dismounted to see to ymy girt h, and while we were waiting impatient to set off, theree; rolled up the avenue the same open carriage we had passed the first Sunday I went to church. I knew at once the fair-haired, haughty beauty, who had bowed so smil- ingly to my guardian. "Provoking!" came from  Harrie-" but it need not keep us." "Hush! said Mr. Grneme, reprovingly. "I am aston- ished at you," as he went forward to greet the intruder. She took his arm as she descended from the carriage, and -went through the ceremonies of greeting to us all with a nonchalant ease and grace, which showed her at once to be all that Harrie had said-a perfect woman of the world. "I have chosen an inopportune time for a visit, I fear, she said; " but pray do not let me detain you, Miss Har- rie. I can only stay a few moments." "Oh!  my cousin and brother were going too," she re- turned rather wickedly. "Really, I am unfortunate," lamented the beauty turn- ing to Mr. Graeme, as if she had not noticed his gloves and riding whip before, to say nothing-of Hector. "I am only too happy to be detained," he said, with the courtesy which was habitual to him. So there was no alternative but for Harrie to dis-   mount, rather discomfited it is true, and we all went in the drawing-room together. Mr. Graeme took a chair by her side. His manner was full of graceful ease. His dark, handsome face was flushed and interested. Hers, too, beamed with pleasure and triumph. Her whole as- pect was joyous and self-possessed. To me it seemed to say-- "He is mine," help yourselves if you can! The conversation was such as is usual at an informal morning visit between neighbors and old friends. I bore very little part therein. Miss Marshton was condescend- ingly polite, but evidently thought me a little girl too un- sophisticated to bandy many words with. At length she disclosed the object of her visit; a little impromptu nut- ting party in their own woods-" would we all join them?" "Certainly," Mr. Graeme would with the greatest pleas- ure. "We may as well merge the ride in a picnic," was all he said to us in a careless way, as if the matter were quite settled without our opinion on the subject. Now, at any other time, chestnutting would have forced itself upon us both simultaneously as a brilliant idea; but coming in that sort of way, it struck a defiant chord in our by no means ' gentle bosoms.' "I do not choose to consider it so," said Harrie bluntly. "I wanted Athol to see the mountain, for we may not have another such day this season-and we have all our plans settled. But Miss Marshton will excuse us if we go?" and she rose in her quick, prompt way. Miss Marshton looked from one to the other. Her eye said ' stay ' to John-' go' I thought to us. But she chimed in with her silvery voice: "Really, I am an intruder I fear-pray, do not let me destroy your plans." "I am sure you will join us with pleasure," said Mr.   *     102 102   w   ATHOL.

He followed her to the porch. bidding Miss Marshton " good-morning," I stood by them. Harrie was already on Spit, turning him impatiently round and round. She leaned forward with a face a/ de- cided as-his. "Athol and I will have our ride. You can go with whom you please. We have no time to lose-lift her Up John."                    up But he did not move. "I cannot allow you to go alone," he said severely.  "There are plenty of other pleasant days coming and we will give it up for this. Come Harrie." He laid his hand on her bridle. "Nonsense!" she cried, and shook it off. "I tell you I am going. Are you Athol?"But I hesitated, not dar- ing to go without his permission. "Do let me," I said coaxingly. "I would s much rather ride-indeed I would." He looked down upon me coldly. "I would not debar you from any pleasure in life," he answered in his chilliest tones, as he dropped the rein and walked back into the house. Harrie gave me a nod of approbation. Isprang on Scamp's back delightedly, and the mo- ment Owen let go her head, we swept off-a-a Wild pair. "Are you sure your brother is not vexed?"I said, the first time we drew rein and gave our gay little steeds a walk. "Vexed is a mild term to apply to John! He is boil- ing with rage!"and she laughed with infinite relish. " hat  is just what possessed me to go.

"To be sure-it can't be helped, however. This is the road to the mountain I believe. Come, now-away with melancholy!" She gave my horse a cut with her whip and off we bounded again, sweeping up the fine breezy hill-side. I was in anything but a comfortable frame of mind. At Derwent I always had my own way, and thought noth- ing about it. But from the very first moment I saw my guardian, I instinctively obeyed him, not daring, even in thought, to rebel, until led on by Harrie. The feeling this audacity engendered was both new and strange. If he passed it by, as I hoped he would, it would be a good precedent. I was my own mistress as heretofore, and yet-and yet, I was a woman-a young and untried one--but a woman's heart glowed within me, and though I dreaded a master, after all, I was only woman enough to love my bonds. What did Mr. Granee think of me? And would he be as angry with me as with Harrie? This was my sole tormenting thought, and so completely was I absorbed in it, I scarcely heeded the road we were taking or the scenery we were passing, which I had so much longed to see. It was rather a silent ride at first, but be- fore we had half climbed the mountain Harrie had suc. ceeded in talking me into something like a revival of good spirits. Her gayety was infectious--beside, anxiety does not abide long in the heart of youth--and mentally throw- ing all the blame upon her, I resolved to enjoy myself if it were possible. That sprightly young damsel seemed to     Io04         ATHOL. be troubled with no scruples like unto mine. I doubt if it ever crossed her careless brain, she had offended and disobeyed one who had the right of authority over her. Now and then we would come to a level piece of ground, and away we would speed at a fine pace, never drawing rein until our horses began toiling up another ascent. Sometimes we stopped to rest and look about us, but the wood proved too good a screen to indulge us in much of a view. It was not as I expected--a regular ascent, where we could turn around and view our progress --but a circuitous- road, winding in and out, so that some of the time I scarcely knew if we were ascending at all. The sky was cloudless. The air keen, bracing, and full of heavy aromatic earth scents. In the dark shade of the wood swayed drowsily a little stream-a softly whispering, babbling little thing. We stopped to listen to its story awhile before going up the road, which gradu- ally was assuming a more steep form. We watered our horses, while we searched around for some leaves to im- provise cups and drink toasts to our distant friends, Miss Georgie included, as merrily as if the water were the rich- est nectar. "This is very suggestive of luncheon," I remarked, as after satisfying our thirst, we tossed our cups on the stream. Harrie laughed. "What a carnal appetite! As if this communion with Nature were not feast enough. But we will be home-let me see-two hours will give us plenty of time, for you know, Athol, we have loitered, and we can afford to rest, dress, etc., a long time before dinner." te Dinner?"I echoed dolefully. "It is no more than ten now-" "Twelve, rather-and to get the view we must go still higher-so-up and away, if we wish to reach home before sunset,"   ATHOL.          I05 "You see," she said, as we arranged our habits, "this is the last resting-place by the brook; we always bring a lunch, for it takes about the whole day, and we like to have time enough; but this morning, in my haste, I forgot-and perhaps it is just as well-we shall rouse a fine appetite for dinner." And again we started forward. The trees grew closer as we ascended. The thick shaggy pines hung their tasselled branches over our pathway. It looked like an unfrequented road. I had some misgivings, and ventured to ask Harrie if it was perfectly safe for us to be alone so far from home, and her reply was a contemptuous shrug. "You would not turn back now, after getting so near? Stop and listen." We drew rein ; not a footfall, not a sound, save the branches just swaying lightly to and fro, and the distant babble of the brook we had left behind. "If you are not afaid of your own shadow," said Har- rie, " come along. Very few people visit the mountain at this season of the year--in summer it is different, but I fancy we are the sole possessors to-day." I looked back. Behind us lay the stony, irregular road, winding in and out and losing itself in the thick wood. Before us lay an open space. We plunged into it confidently calling it a road, pressing forward, and then again into the forest, the autumn leaves rustling around us; everything else strangely still and quiet. Suddenly the wood ended, and emerging into space again we found our- selves upon a point of rock, on the side of what I now perceived was indeed the lofty mountain I had seen from the Dell. "Excelsior!" shouted Harrie, while Spit began care- fully picking his way among the loose stones. "It is finer here," and turning a sharp angle of rock, it suddenly burst upon us--all that beautiful view stretched out and un- folding itself like a map before us, with its endless vari- 5*  106         ATHOL,  ety of hill and dale, rich, fertile and fair, with clustering villages nestled in under the hills, and slender white spires showing thin and clear against the sombre back-ground, while in and out among the green mass trailed a little thread-like stream. We saw the smoke of a tiny car meas- uring itself evenly with the river; and, far away in the dis- tance, blue and indistinct, still other ranges of hills until they were lost in cloud. I shaded my eyes with my hands and looked till I could look no longer, while. Harrie pointed out, in her voluble way, the main features of the landscape. It was not grand and wild as at home. It was picturesque and fertile-a view which places th'e Berkshire hills par excellence above all others to me. I gazed at it long and tenderly--my dear new home! Oh! so dear already I said to myself, and I tried to pick out the Dell and its surroundings, but it was a mere spot on the wide map--a speck-a point-but toward it my heart went out, and I was content and grateful that this home was henceforth to be mine. We tied our horses to the trees and wandered around until we were tired ; then finding a piece of flat rock over-  looking a deep chasm, we seated ourselves; Harrie gather- ing up her skirts very composedly, and finding two or three peanuts in her pocket, fell to munching them quite selfishly. "' You are a perfect Yankee," I laughed, after giving her o-,glance. "If you were a man you would undoubt- edly whit. e, instead of eating nuts." She tossed her shells over the sheer precipice, leaning forward to wt ch them fall, and said with much unction as if there were saving grace in the thouglht,  "Yes, I am a real Yankee, and in common parlance, 'nothing else.' Do you see our river?" pointing down with genuine admiration to the silver snake glittering in the distance.   ATHOL.          107 "The Housatonic?" Yes." And then I sat down by her side and together we watched the thin little line of white smoke which cut swiftly down its path to the great city. Harrie, slashing the air with her riding-whip, at last broke the silence, i "Are you disappointed? Can it compare with home?" It is not at all like home," I answered, but it is more beautiful than I can express. So cultvated-so fertile--" "So matter of fact," interpolated Harrie. "That is all we aim at here. We have nofancyfine views, where, for instance, the falls are turned on' like the Kauterskili, determined nod, which I had already found out meant, "I have said it."

Not another sound broke the stillness, except the rustle of the leaves. I wish we had brought the dogs," at last said Harrie. "Ponto's bark would wake up all the echoes round about." "And make it seem more safe," I said, " the silence is absolutely appalling." "Eyes look your last then," said Harrie, "and I will scramble down and untie the horses. It is high time we were starting for home." "And I dread to meet your brother," I said. "It has been a lovely day, but I feel we have done wrong-yes, let us go." Nonsense!" and she laughed perversely. "What a child you are, Athol! Don't you know when a woman will she will? John does any way-" "Nevertheless I have offended him, and I shall not rest until I have made things right." "I dare say John has forgotten all about it," she re- turned quickly, " and if we are only home before he is, it will not be noticed." And we untied our horses and turned their heads homeward without another word. We walked the horses all the way down to the brook again, then finding a level piece of road, whipped them up, and started on a fine gallop. They were refreshed with their rest on the moun- tain-so were we--and going down hill is a rather easier task than going up. I rode by Harrie's side, trusting en- tirely to her guidance. We had ridden some distance when I was startled by her dropping the reins. She looked around. "This will never do, Athol," she said in her positive way. "I am not on the right road!" "Let us ride back then," I returned promptly. I   "Back? Why, I don't know where I've missed it- there's the difficulty, and there is such a labyrinth of paths. It's too provoking"  I could only ask vacantly, ' What shall we do?" "Make the best of it, I suppose, and go ahead; this road must lead somewhere." And on we went at a somewhat increased pace. After pursuing this route for, what seemed to me, an intermina- ble time, we arrived at the end-a wood lot, utterly de- serted now. Harrie looked around collectedly. "You know as well as I do, we are lost," she said. "We shall be quite 'The Babes in the Woods,' on a larger scale." She spoke as complacently as if she were but a mile from home. "It is too dreadful," I said, with a vain attempt at con- cealing my vexation.  "Can nothing move or frighten you? What will Mr. Graeme say?" "As if I cared that!" firing up suddenly, and snap- ping her fingers defiantly in the direction of Marshton Lea. "What in the name of all that is desperate possessed me to come with you?"I could not refrain from saying and you not even knowing the way " "Why, I have taken you the exact route, you ungrate- ful girl-and you enjoyed the view I am sure--but in go- ing back I am all turned around." "And we may have to stay here all night!" "Perhaps," she answered gravely. "Though 'not if the court knows itself-and it thinks it do!' The only thing is to turn back to the cross roads and try it over again." It was getting late. We were tired and carnally minded enough to care for dinner, but back we turned. Our con-     OI          ATHOL. versation had fallen into monosyllables, with anxious looks ahead for some token of the right path. I scarcely spke, only longing with an intense desire to reach home before my guardian. It made my heart beat and the blood rish to my face, to think of meeting him. At last we camr to the cross roads and Harrie's spirits revived. "I know just where I made the mistake," she said. "It was so absurd of me not to recollect the turn." "Are you sure?"I could not help asking anxiously. "Why, yes. Don't you remember the little farm-house' lying down there, which you said looked like love i a  cottage?" "Oh! yes," and really confident we flew down the road, Harrie's spirits rising with every bound. We were nearly out of the wood when she challeng ed me to a trial of speed. The road ran almost level for some distance. She gave the word, and away we star ed in excellent style. She rode gracefully and well, and Spitfire, who well merited his name, seemed instinctiv ly  to understand her. We were rushing on at a rapid rate when a stream, with high, turfy banks, flowed across 4ur  path. There was a bridge farther down, but Harrie cis-  dained going around. In an instant she was over--look- ing back she waved her whip. "You can't cross that stream, Athol, bettero o around."  "Do you fancy I shall let you go ahead of me that way?"I answered defiantly, and giving Scamp a touch as I flew. "Here goes," I shouted, as I followed her wild ex- ample.  For one moment in-the blind leap my head swari--my  arm fell nerveless-I saw and heard nothing but the flah  of the blue sky, and the foam of the stream-then a crash, as I lifted the gallant little horse with a desperate effort  !    i   ATHOL.          III a maddening sensation of pain-a plunge-the next in- stant I was floundering and choking in the muddy stream. There was a confused minute of struggling to free myself from the horse, then with a start and bound, which gave me another ducking, he clambered up the opposite bank. I might have been floundering there until this present time, for all the assistance I received from Harrie, who, after seizing Scamp by the bridle, only laughed immoder- ately at me. But a fisherman quietly whipping the stream farther down, seeing the accident, hastened to offer aid, and almost as soon as I was in, I found myself out and helped up the bank. "What! Prince Hal!" he cried in surprise as Harrie leaning forward, laughingly gave him her hand in wel- come. "And what new mad freak has his Royal High- ness to-day?" No new whim," with a toss of her head, "only a very old one-the whim of pleasing myself," and she presented him to me as "Dr. Truman." It was rather an awkward introduction, rendered more so by her quoting: "Look at her garments, Clinging like cerements-" in what I felt bound to consider very ill-timed merriment. I must have cut a pretty figure, but the gentleman didn't seem to think of that; his only fear was lest I should take cold, and assisting me in wringing a little ex- tra dampness from my long dress, he advised getting home as soon as possible. As he placed me on my horse, I was conscious of a sharp pain in my ankle, which I tried my utmost to con- ceal. "You are fortunate," he said, "if you escaped injury. You are almost certain of a cold at this time of the year." I      I 12        ATHOL. He had thrown off his hat, and a cursory glance at his face showed him to be all Harrie had called him on the night of my arrival-" old Truman." But it was a grand old head, massive and dark, with a broad high forehead, and gentle, womanish eyes-entirely out of place with the rest of the face; and added to this a form strong and stalwart as a Hercules. "Thank you," I said, as he stood holding Scamp by the bridle. "I am all right now, no thanks to Harrie there, who has done nothing but laugh at my unlucky es- capade. But for you, I would still be in the brook." I tried to speak gayly, but as he placed my foot in the stirrup, I could not forbear uttering a cry of pain. "You are hurt more than you will acknowledge, I fear," with an inquiring look out of the "womanish" eyes. "You were so pale a moment since and now your color rivals my gay Prince Hal." "You are right," said that young lady positively, her merriment giving place to anxiety. "You need not deny it, Athol, you are suffering pain." And her careless manner underwent a complete change. "Nothing that dry clothes and a little of that sover- eign panacea, arnica, will not cure," I tried to answer un- concernedly. "Are you sure? I never should forgive myself you know," and she hurriedly related to Dr. Truman our ad- venture of the day, and John's displeasure. Her frank confession did not seem to surprise him. I imagine he was rather used to her caprices. I heard him call her a whimsical child as full of naughtiness as whims, then he bade us go home, like two bad children as we were. I felt nervous and frightened, and only stayed to add thanks with my " good-night." Harrie scarcely waited until we were out of his hear- ing.   ATIOL.          113 , What an especial providence the old pill box has been," she said, without lowering her voice in the least. "I doubt if we could have got along without him. But don't tell John-and how do you feel now?" "Very like Pliable, I suspect, when he waded- out of Despond. Indeed I fancy he must have been in much such a state, mentally as well as physically." And on we rode, my foot giving a twinge at every step. We got along so slowly it was almost dark when we reached the Dell. All the family came out at the sound of our horses' hoofs. Harrie sprang down without any assistance, and with her usual esprit; but when I essayed the same feat I became at once giddy and faint with pain. Mr. Graeme stood in the doorway. He did not attempt7 to come toward me. It was Guy who exclaimed in sur- prise:  "Why, Athol, child, what ails you? You are pale as a ghost and your dress is dripping wet-" "Oh nothing," I forced myself to answer, " only my dress got in the brook-" "The dress without you? A very ingenious and elaborate idea, but we must doubt its strict accuracy." As he lifted nle to the ground I made a violent effort to stand-I endeavored to speak, but the words died away unuttered. "Something has happened," I heard Alice say in alarm, " lift her up Guy-she is hurt," then for a moment I was lost. When I came to myself I lay on the sofa. I had just consciousness enough to hear voices around me, but not the one I listened for. At length I opened my eyes. Mr. Graeme was there. He stood at the foot of the couch leaning on the back of a chair-looking down at me with cold displeased eyes, and I could see plainly, in spite of his long mustache, the angry compression of his     "4         ATHOL. lips. He stood without moving when I looked up at him, and it was Guy's hand, not his, which clasped mine. He did not smile, he did not speak. I raised myself with an effort and threw off Guy's hand. "I am better," I said, " indeed, I feel quite well-all but this pain-" as in attempting to rise I felt a sharp acute thrill through my foot and ankle again. "I really think, Groeme," said Guy, " it would be well to send for the doctor. There may be some dislocation." "Very well," was all he vouchsafed to reply, and Yith- out another look at me, he 'left the room, and did not return until the doctor's step was heard in the hall. I lay there waiting-helpless and miserable as one could be, the hot tears forcing themselves to my eyes, while Mrs. Fleming, Guy and Alice, did all in their power to make me com- fortable. Harrie had gone off to her own room, and did not return until she ushered the doctor in to see me. I found, then, to my surprise and consternation, he was my. rescuer from the muddy horrors of the brook. He shook his head reprovingly at me, as he felt my pulse and ex- amined my foot. Mr. Graeme resumed his position. I felt his cold, black eyes reading my face. What pover those eyes had over me! I could not bear their reproving glance, so I turned my head away, with a miserable long- ing to hide myself from him. It did not take the doctor many minutes to arrive at the conclusion that I had a tad sprain, which would lay me up for some time to come-also, that Mr. Graeme was one of the most unenvied of men to have two such wild girls to manage and care for! [Ie mixed no compliments with his prescription for a comp s- ing draught, and ordered me instantly to bed, recommei d- ing at, the same time a ball and chain, and even handcuffs, for "Prince Hal," as he seemed to always call her,-aad she swept him the sauciest little courtesy imaginable ior his charitable intentions, and bowed him out-of the room. /                  .i   ATHOL.          I 5 Still my guardian stood by me, his face showing an anxiety and displeasure he did not attempt to conceal. He was angry with me. I could bear the agony of the sprained foot, but not his anger, and choking with tears I held out my hand to him. He left his chair and bending over me, asked me shortly " what I wanted." "You," I answered, summoning up all my courage. "Do not be vexed with me any longer." - He took my hand and looked at me fixedly for a mo- ment. "You are a self-willed child," he said at length. "I am afraid I have taken upon myself a harder task than I at first apprehended. The doctor says youi will be ill." And his annoyed, upbraiding look smote my heart with renewed pain. ( I do not mind the illness or pain," I said boldly, and I pulled his face down so close to mine that the others could not hear, "it is only in that I have offended you- and if you would-if you could--" and I burst into sudden tears. "It was absurd folly to attempt such a thing, but I thought Harrie would laugh if I couldn't do that little leap," I said apologetically-" and then I was in a hurry to get home. I knew we had done wrong'-indeed, in- deed it has troubled me all day." " I What shall I do with you and Harrie together?" he asked despairingly, as he knit his brows in a perplexed, half relenting manner. "I will be like the little girl in the story book," I said, for I saw forgiveness in his tone and look already, "I will be good and not do so any more!" We were alone in the room.. Guy had disappeared with Alice, and sister was superintending the fomenta- tion for my foot. Harrie had followed the doctor to the porch, where I heard her laughingly bid him defiance and   I16         ATHOL. the whole Graeme household included, if they should dare check her liberty. Mr. Graeme still sat by me patting ab- sently both my hands, which still lay in his. "You f0ol- ish, wilful child," he repeated two or three times, ' So you ' will be good and not do so any more?' You Will truly try to please me henceforth and forever?" "I can bear anything but your coldness and displeas- ure," I said, "only say you will-forgive me." "You foolish child," he said reluctantly and with some return of his former tenderness. "I shall be forced to say yes, whether I will or not. Now put your arms around my neck and I will carry you up stairs "-and feeling the reconciliation complete, I put both my arms as he bade me, and grateful and content, in spite of the pain which the least movement caused, was carried to my room carefully and tenderly, and given over to- the care of Alice and Harrie-the latter sprightly young lady seeming not the least disconcerted at her brother's displeasure.  "Lay her here, John," she said, as she shook up the pillows in her lively energetic way. Then spreading cut b her full skirts on the bed, she went off in a perfect rh d- omontade upon what Dr. Truman had said " would, could, and should be done." As for Mr. Grame, after carefully depositing me in the place and position Harrie indicated, he went off with a kind " good-night" and directions to lis sisters to prove good nurses. In less than fifteen minutes we heard Hector dash down the avenue. "Heigho!" sighed Harrie, "Marshton Lea agai! Why didn't you try your powers of pleasing, and keep him at home Athol, now that you had coaxed him into such a sublime act of ieconciliation. I wonder, if you had be In killed, instead of coming off-by the merciful interposi- tion of Providence-with a sprained ankle, if he wo ld have stayed home for one night," and she pouted.   ATEIOL.         I 7 "He has been very kind to me," I said: he has for- given me entirely, and I will not do anything to displease him again." But Harrie was pleased to laugh immoderately, and all the time she and Alice were busy bathing my ankle and undressing me, burst into occasional fits of merri- ment at my absurdities as she called them. It was only I who was thankful for his kind good- night-and as I lay tossing and feverish all the long night through, I could not forget the cold displeased glitter of the black eyes, or their sudden change to forgiving ten- derness, and I inwardly resolved it would be a very, very long time before I braved or caused his anger again.  CHAPTER IX. OH! the long, dreary days that followed-days that were passed in pain, fever and uneasiness-perfect un- broken weariness it would have been but for the visits of my guardian, who came to me every morning when I was utterly worn out with the unrest and wakefulness of the night. His strong hand touched and cooled my feverish pulse. He petted me like a child. Each day he brought me something new and pleasant to hear, read or see, and I was only too happy in feeling that he had utterly forgot- ten the cause of my sickness. Dr. Truman was kind and attentive. Mrs. Fleming and Alice were gentle and de- voted as two sisters could be, and Harrie, thoughtless, impulsive and full of fire and fun, flashed in and out of my room at all hours of the day and night. Nevertheless, time hung heavily on my hands, and five weeks passed slowly away. Every morning Mr. Greme came to see  me; almost every evening, Harrie told me, he spent at    "I8         ATHOL. Marshton Lea. I often lay in my bed and listened for the sound of Hector's hoofs. I always heard him come in and go to his room at night when he returned. Some- times he went into the little library across the hall, and by the scent of a cigar, which came faintly to me, I im- agined him smoking and walking, as was his customi when thinking. What was he dreaming about in these lonely walks? Did he love Miss Marshton?: I deter- mined to ask him, and the next morning, when he came into my room, where I was lying on my couch in a loose wrapper, reading, I suddenly surprised him by asking in the gravest possible manner, "if he really loved Miss Marshton." He was standing on the hearth rug, in front of the grate fire, his riding gloves and whip in hand, looking down at me in his grand, Romanesque way, with his black hair tossed carelessly back-his heavy riding cloak drooping from his broad shoulders. It gave me a great sense of vitality and vigor but to look at him, and by some mes- meric agency, he imparted some of his life and strength to me, when he was near. When I asked him such a sudden, straight-forwar question, he looked down at me with a puzzled, curious look lighting his face for an instant, then threw back hiL head with one of his rare bursts of laughter. "My little girl," he said, " you are as fresh aid simple as one of your own mountain daisies! I shall most cer. tainly call you Daisy from this time forward!" and he came over to where I was lying and threw down his whip and gloves. "Let me look into your eyes, Athol--so." I turned my head to- the light. "Yes-I was sure of it-your eyes are green! deeply, darkly, desperately green! I am afraid it is a family vice you have inherited, Athol--"I put my hand over my eyes with a little deprecating ges- O  '             iC   ATHOL.          119 ture-"I am not well," I said. "Do not make fun of me now, while I am so weak and miserable. If I do not like Miss Marshton it is because she is taking you away from us. It is because we are all so lonely and wretched when you are not here-and if you are away-away from us always-with that coquettish woman who never will never can, love you as we do, I, for one would give up in despair and die-" and I burst into a passion of tears at the very thought. "My dear child-my little Daisy!" and this time he spoke seriously, " do for once and all, put away such childish fancies. I do like Miss Marshton-and, if you -are to play the part of Inquisitor-frankly, I admire her. She is far prettier than the generality of ladies one meets now-a-days. She is gay, witty and accomplished. It is pleasant to go there-that is all-as yet-" he added, meditatively, tapping his boot against my sofa. "My little Daisy need have no fears. My heart is quite safe, I think-I wonder if I shall always be obliged to stay at home and play the agreeable to my own household, to say nothing of answering an Inquisitor on each hand if I do but look at a lady." "We are only women--" "Therefore unreasonable,-and you are cooped up here, with that fanciful brain of yours running wild-you will grow morbid-we must get you out." And he lifted me very tenderly from the sofa, and car- ried me to-the window in his great strong arms. It was the first time I had looked out since I was sick. Then the lawn was quite brown and the trees fast be- coming leafless; but now, all was covered with a soft white wrapping of snow ; the trees and fences were bend- ing with the weight of it. It looked pleasant, soft and still, as he held me there i'n the old window seat, and I lay back in his arms, very happy and comfortable, watch- ap n   I i20        ATHOL. ing far down the avenue for the passing sleighs on the high road. "How good you are to me," I whispered. ' Yes? I feel quite fatherly lately, I must acknowl- edge. With sister's health to worry over, and Alice- well, I have completely given her over to Guy-but Har- rie, with her defiant airs and graces, and you little pale Daisy, with your sprained ankle, your wilfulness and your jealousies, I shall get to be an old man in spite of i myself, my child." "I am not a child," I retorted-half inclined to be in- dignant. "I am nearly seventeen!" "And I am old enough to be your father," he laughed. !' Think-when you are in the prime of life I shall be an old, old man! You complain of my leaving you-you will every one of you leave me before you half reach my age-and when my hair is white-" I passed my hand through his heavy dark locks. "They must never be white with sorrow, or care," I said. "-We will always stay here together-and you will be the same-the dearest, kindest, best-" He put his grand, proud head down close to mine- he stopped my ready words with kisses. "Little flatter- er! You are happy and content with me are you? Then I will not leave you to-day. I will stay here and you may command me--for just this once." He carried me back to the sofa, he sat down in a low chair by my side. My head reclining on his shoulder, my hand in his, my whole being steeped in quiet happiness. W"What a comfort it is to have you for a friend, cousin and guardian," I said softly-" one whom I can always trust, love and honor." "Do not," he said, averting his eyes--" do'not trust me too far. I am only a man--Athol--child, you will spoil me with your flatteries." *)i   ATHOL.          121 I only shook my head and laughed at him. "I must read you a mawkish little piece of sentiment- ality just fitted for you--about ' making idols ' and ' find- ing them clay,' and to bewail that worship, therefore-I will not say--' pray '-poor advice, you will say, from a sinner like me--but do not," and this time he looked down at me seriously, c do not go on in this absurd way, imagining me a saint, a hero-for aught I know, a demi- god! I am only a man,--a careworn, world-weary, sin- battered old rascal. Do not trust me too far!" He spoke playfully, but he was in earnest,-he told me once he had seen the world and exhausted it,--I knew it was so, and yet I could not separate him from all my pre- conceived ideas of a knight, a hero, "sans peur et sans reproche." And with this hero, had dawned for me a hope and brightness which my young life had\never be- fore known.. I did not answer after he spoke this, I only'lay still in a pleasant dreaminess, but stole a glance at hisface, as seen in profile. I was satisfied. He turned around and saw me scanning his face. "' I told you I would give myself up to you to-day, so what shall we do?" he inquired, looking down at me in his kindly protecting way. "Ah! read to me, it is so long since I have heard you." "Then shut your eyes and rest, and I shall see what I can find here." He piled up his cloak, gloves and whip, in my little rocker, strode up to my row of books on the hanging shelves, and rapidly scanned its contents. "This is the very thing," he said, and he brought back a little thin book, opening to a mark-a faded sprig of blue fringed gentian--where Mr. Craigie and I had stopped reading-- so long ago it seemed! 6  122         ATHOL. "I will take it right up here," he said, " where you left off, shall I?" "Don't read it to me," I begged. "I am sick unto death of Io and her trumpery old gad-fly--" "But at that insta-:, in bounded Harrie, in her long, sweeping habit, and h;r' hands full of letters which she tossed before her brother. "A truce to reading about those horrid old Greek. nobodies," as she pounced upon the book. "I must tell you. I was looking it over the other day," she said- "with the most unfeigned disgust, I acknowledge-when Captain Alger called, with that little nobody, Mr. Thorn, and if you will believe it, he asked me if it was a pleasant book, also, if Strophe and Antistrophe were good charac- ters / " "' What did you say?" "Well, I gave him to understand," she answered with her usual equanimity, "Strophe was a perfectly respecta- ble character, but I could not answer for the Auntie." "Oh! Harrie, I am sure he must have known you were laughing at him," I answered. "Not he! But the gallant captain looked daggers and drawn swords. Isn't he handsome though-Athol, you must positively get well. I want you to see him." "Captain Alger?" interrupted Mr. Graeme, turning around. He still held his letters, as Harrie had tossed them in his hands. He had not even examined them, but was smilingly listening to her rambling talk. "You surely do not mean Georgie Marshton's cousin?" "The very same-a sort of cousin I believe, although it is so many removes he is charming! I was a little girl when he was here before, but you knew him brother." "I have not seen him at the Dell," said my guardian. "No, he is staying in the village with his friend, Mr. Thorn--the disgusting little popinjay. How upon earth    5H :X        ATHOL.          12  they are friends is a mystery! I think I shall'become pa triotic now-" suddenly twisting her face into mock so lemnity, "am I fitted for a soldier's wife?" "Tell me how he looks," said Mr. Grinme, without no ticing her question. "Like the 'Amal,'" she said, ".in Hypatia-with hi long yellow hair--" "What a goose!" and he took her by the shoulder and swept her out of the room, and I heard her running down the stairs, singing airily- "The Army and Navy forever, Three cheers for the Red, White and Blue." Mr. Graeme took up his letters, and began slowly look ing them over. He threw them down, one after another, on his knee as he finished reading them. It was a large mail and took some time. I had none. I had no one to write to me, save Elsie and Mr. Craigie, and their letters would b, like angels' visits, I knew. I reached out my hand anm took up the envelopes; as they lay before m'e, handing ; them out to him one by one, carelessly whiling away th time until he should be ready to read to me. At length I came to the last one. A long thin envel ope, bearing a foreign post-mark. He caught it out o0 my hand eagerly. I heard a smothered "the devil," unde his breath, he tore it open with a feverish eagerness tha he' could ill conceal. Troubled scorn, defiance, and sud den, blinding anger, I read in the swift shadow that dark ened his face. I looked up in surprise and wonder, stil greater wonder, when, as he finished. reading it he crum pled it in his hand with a sudden exclamation of thank fulness and joy. His handsome face flushed guill ily, when he saw my inquiring look. He rose up at ruptly.     124         ATHOL.              X "I thought you had bad news," I said, in some confu- sion, " but it is good?" "Good? by the Lord, child, I haven't had such glo- rious news in many a year!"And he opened the crum- pled letter, and smoothing it out, read it all over again, slowly taking in every word with a fierce relish. When he had finished he took out a cigar, and twist- ing the paper lighted it by the grate. He watched it until it slowly burned away, leaving only a small portion in his hand. Then he lighted his cigar and,tossed the smoking paper on the hearth, watching it fall to pieces. "Heigh ho!" he said excitedly. "I wish all my troubles could vanish as quickly as that!" He blew the ashes away; as he did so two or three bits of the scorched paper flew out on the carpet; he brushed them carelessly aside and with a great laugh caught up cloak and hat and was striding away without any further notice of me. - "I thought you were going to read to me," I called out. "True," taking his cigar from his lips a moment, but with no intention of remaining. "You must think me very odd." 1 "Worse than odd," I thought, my eyes filling with tears, but I said not a-word. "I must go," he said. "It is only a matter of busi- ness, but I must attend to it immediately. Some other time-" and he banged the door after him and was gone before I could utter a word. Mrs. Fleming's room was directly under mine. I lis- tened to the quick, echoing footsteps as they went through the long hall, down the stairs, and ended in her room. I heard them walking up and down, talking-once his voice rang out in an excited burst of laughter,-what- ever joy or sorrow John had, sister shared it with him.   )   * A'rHOL.         125 In a short time I heard her door close! What can it be? I thought, and Mother Eve getting the better of me I resolved to see where John would go. I limped to the door and locked it, and then, by'the aid ofla chair, climbed up into the deep window seat. I pulled the thick curtain around me, and sat watching for my guardian to come out. I did not wait long before I heard the tramp of:Hector's hoofs, and soon they dash- ed down the drive. I watched the tall, graceful rider, until his retreating form was lost in the winding of the road, under the hill, then I stood up, like a chicken, on one foot, looking in the direction of Marshton Lea. It was just as I thought. There was the powerful black horse, clear against the white blinding snow. I strained my eyes to see if it were really he,-sure enough-Hec- tor was taking John Gremne fast as fast could be up the broad avenue leading to the Lea. I was jealous and angry, and so absorbed in the feel- ing, that I quite forgot my lameness, and jumped down from my post of observation with so much energy that the pain made me perfectly furious for a moment, and I could only sit curled up on the carpet as I had fallen, and seek consolation in my usual burst of tears. After the pain had subsided somewhat, I crept along to my sofa, only bent upon being as utterly miserable for the rest of the day, as I was an hour before supremely happy. Just then the bits of scorched paper lying where John had tossed them attracted my attention. I caught them- up eagerly. I smoothed the pieces out carefully. I tried to put them together, but they were so scorched and blackened I could only make out a few words. The let- ter had been written in French. I made out a few unim- portant words, "Adble," I certainly saw. I held it to the light, and yes, it was. "Acele," plainly written in a masculine, careless hand. On another scrap it said,     I26         ATHOL. "it must be," and the last piece of all had " dead" on it and part of a name ending in-val. I could make noth- ing out of it whatever, except-and the story Harrie had told me, I felt sure might have some connection with the beautiful lady, whose name was identical with this in the letter. I hobbled to my door and unlocking it, called Harrie, and told her all about the letter, and'we two laid our heads together and made out quite a respectable romance, with the fragments of paper and our imaginations to draw largely on. "I can tell you," said Harrie, when we had pursued this mystery until we were quite lost in its intricacies, " if you can climb window seats you can walk down stairs, and come you must and see my handsome captain, I am so violently in love." And throwing John and his secrets aside, as carelessly as she did everything else, she rattled on at such a voluble rate of "Captain Geoffrey Alger," I was -sick unto death of even his name. I put my fingers in my ears. I resolutely refused to hear anything more of the man, until Harrie, finding me resolved in my taci- turnity, danced out of the room and left me to brood over my unquiet thoughts in loneliness. I did not see my guardian again that evening, or for several subsequent days. When, however, he did come to see me, he acted as if 'nothing had happened, and was so carelessly happy and indifferent that every spark of my old idolatrous worship threatened to be suddenly quenched in the jealous rage which inspired me. At all events, I was weary enough of playing the part of interesting invalid, while Harrie was having a gay time all by herself, and I inwardly resolved I would stay in my room no longer. So I began with a visit to Harrie, and with her assistance soon went, from room to room on the whole floor, and gaining strength with every such attempt,   ATHOL.          I27 I was soon pronounced by sister well enough to come down any day. At this, Mr. Groeme, declaring he should be the first to bring me in the family circle again, invaded my precincts and carried me off in his arms to the pleas- ant old parlor, where all were assembled from whom I had been separated so many weeks since my dismal acci- dent. It happened to rain, so the wonderful captain did not intrude and John did not go to the Lea, and, capricious as ever, he seemed bent upon entertaining us. He sang us some new songs, he read to us, he helped Alice label some wonderful charity garments for her school, he jested with Harrie and was watchful and tender of me; and Harrie bustled around, making the tea and buttering the toast in her fluttering, overpowering way-and altogether we had a charming evening that ended all too quickly. "You are your old self again," I whispered, as he threw his arm around me and helped me up the stairs, for I would not let him carry me this time. "By to- morrow you will not have one word for your poor little Daisy." "And so youi have had a pleasant evening?" he asked, overlooking my last remark. "Charming!"I exclaimed with a ready warmth, which made him smile one of his brilliant, mocking smiles, which I never could endure. It spoke so of con- scious power. I told him not to look that way again. He called me a " foolish child," a " puss," and a "Daisy; " and, presto, change--away went my jealousies, and sur- rendering myself in an instant to the charm of the pres- ent, I went back in the twinkling of an eye to my old allegiance. And so he helped me to the little couch in my own room, and asked "Could he stay with me awhile." And I said "Yes," with an eager delight I did not try to hide.     128         ATHOL.       -       J There was a little smouldering fire on the hearth. I could not see his face by it, only the broad, manly shoulders, and proud, erect head, dimly and in outline. But it was enough; enough that I had him all to myself; heard his clear, resonant voice. He called me "Daisy," and " child," and I was satisfied, even if I did not see lirn. It was enough to feel his presence in my heart. I cannot attempt to recall in substance, at this I pse of time, all we talked about, but I received through him a wonderful glimpse of a far-off beautiful world-a world of thought, rare and cultivated, and different from any realm my fancy had ever painted, dimly or in dream, before. I listened in a breathless trance, while he, with a firm, masterly hand, sketched rapidly, never-to-be for- gotten pictures, for memory to turn back -and linger fondly over, until I was lost in listening to the music of his voice and words. I was less than a child; I was'a babe in my knowledge of art and literature, and as the smoothly rounded sentences fell from his lips they buried themselves in my heart. He opened that night to me the gates of a possible Paradise in the realms of FThou'ght, and I felt I could never be satisfied until I, too, had!een what lay beyond. Heaven only knows how long I lay there earnestly listening, but it was so long that Harrie, who was a per- fect owl about sleeping, coming in hastily, exclaimel at the lateness of the hour, lit my night lamp, and taking her brother very vigorously by the shoulders, swept him out of the room and ordered me to bed. "You will make yourself sick again," she said in half apology, "and then you will miss seeing my ' Anmal.' John ought to know better," she went on in her peremnp- tory way, " than to keep you up so. But there is so)me unaccountable magnetism about him. Just so he is with Georgiannia Marshton."   ATHOL.         129 "Stop," I said, "I will not hear another word to- night;" and that name bringing me down to sublunary scenes again, I very decorously went to-bed. CHAPTER X. I GOT well at last. I was happy, and quite content. Home grew more and more sweet to me, and the days flew by like a dream. And in due course of time I met, and became acquainted with, the "Amal:" and a tall, stal- wart "Goth" he certainly was, with a frank, fair face, his cheek somewhat browned by exposure to the sun, but the forehead broad and white as a girl's, the hair tossed and breezy, and "tawny with gold,'" lying over it in careless curls; clear, honest blue eyes, full of mirth and humor, and the mouth nearly hidden by the long amber mustache. JAll my ideas of a hero were fully answered in my first glance of him. The Amal indeed! A Bayard, a Sidney, a Henry of Navarre! It only needed the snow-white plume to complete the picture my girlish fancy involun- tarily made. And then, mentally as well as physically, I found him towering head and shoulders above his little dapper friend, Mr. Thorn. They were always together, which was somewhat of a mystery to me, as well as Harrie. We saw a great deal of them, and time flew by swiftly and altogether uneventless, but for Alice's mar- riage, which after all was not such a very great event. Their engagement had been such a matter-of-course thing, that when one pleasant morning the rector from a neighboring parish rode over and they were pronounced C"one twain," in the little gray church, there was no un- usual stir or bustle, and every one seemed satisfied it was 6*     130         ATHOL, . the most sensible thing they could do. They did not even go on the customary bridal tour, which every (ne now-a-days seems to think indispensable. But as Alice said laughingly, their tour would be from the Dell to the church, and from church to the rectory. We had entered eagerly upon the task of setting her house in order'and consumed a vast amount of time and words over the sim- plest arrangement. Mr. Grmeme had generously furnished it for them. It was pretty, tasteful, and not extravagant, although he could not resist the luxury of a beautiful little parlor organ, considerately thinking of Alice. That-young lady was quite serene and unmoved, but Guy walled backward and forward from the Dell to the rectory in a state of dumb, quiet happiness, very comical to behold. "What a tranquil couple!" mourned Harrie: "I am sure it is not the way I shall be married. I shall hav a great pow-wow, or I won't be married at all!" But everything went on quietly in spite of Harrie's longing; and when all was in order, and the words making them " man and wife " pronounced, Alice and Guy entered their pleasant little home as quietly as they entered upon the duties of their married life. We hardly missed Alice, or thought of her as away from us and belonging to another, for we saw her almost as much as of old, and then twice a week, in accord- ance with mny guardian's strict command, we went down to our German, with Guy for my tutor. We had no other lessons to annoy us, and did as we pleased emphatically the remainder of the tine. And while Captain Alger was yet lingering in the vlil- lage, the great high festival of the ecclesiastical year came around. That gracious time of hope and fulfilmnent of promise, when the old, and yet forever new, sweet words, were sounding all through the Christian world, "Unto us a Son is born, unto us a Child is given."  ATHOL.          I31 All the young people in the church had assembled to decorate it, and sister wished me to join. So I went with Harrie nothing loth, for it was a new thing to me. We found everybody there, as Harrie said. Even the Marsh- tons condescended to honor the little unpretending church with their presence. John came with, them of course. The two younger girls, Bella and Lizzie, were very pleasant and lovable, and I had formed some acquaintance with them. Miss Bella was pretty, almost as pretty as her elder sister. Both were just escaped from the thraldom of the "Sacred Heart," and were wild and jubilant in consequence. Harrie and Bella were quite friends. Lizzie, a little pale delicate child, seemed frightened if any one spoke to her, and was quite a con- trast to her elder sisters, but I liked her better than either. All the gay young people from the village had come trooping into the church that Christmas eve, and were busy tying wreaths and forming stars and crosses, Roman, Greek and Maltese-even John assisted in nailing and trimming, and all were chatting cheerfully. It was a new and pretty sight to me, and H joined Harrie with a hearty good will in decorating the organ. We were hanging our last wreaths on it, when Bella Marshton called Harrie away to see to some manipulation of old English text. So I sat alone in the loft some time, until Captain Alger, look- ing up, saw me. His cap was off in an instant, and bound- ing up the stairs, two steps at a time, after his boyish fashion, he was bylmy side. "Alone?" he asked. "Then I shall like nothing bet- ter than intruding. Have I your gracious permission to  rest awhile, and here?" And he took the organist's seat, looking down upon me, as I sat in one of the stalls, with that bewitchingly pleasant, frank smile of:his, which every one declared was irresistible in Geoffrey Alger,     132         ATHOL. "We are the only idlers in the church," I said, look- ing at the busy crowd flitting among the green and lamps. "I am afraid it is my normal condition, Miss Athol; but we have done our work, and well, too. See, is it not beautiful?" and together we looked down at the perfec- tion of our arrangements below. "I do so love the church," he said, suddenly and seri- ously. "It is so sweet to think this grand universal song is heard all over the world to-night, ' Glory to God in the highest, and on earth, peace, good will to men.'" "I did not think," I answered, "I could give my heart to it so suddenly. I was not born in this faith, you know, and it is new and strange-" ' Ah? Then you can never know the happiness a little child possesses who carries about with him forever this mystical seal of the church, the sign of the cross. You have never had the privilege of such a childhood," he added gravely; " but in the years to come, you will bless these later days as ' the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. " I looked up in his earnest, handsome face, with sur- prise. I had never seen the captain in aught but a gay mood, and I scarcely knew how to answer him. - "You of all men to talk to me so!"I said at length. "uAnd why not? Itjs such an unspeakable hope end comfort always to have around and about me tlte arm of this great protection. Why should I not tell you so?" "You are so-so-" -and almost inclined to beg I a word, a word, Miss Tox '--" so gay," and, after a moment's consideration, " and then in the army!" "Perhaps it is that which makes mne so light-hearted and happy," he explained eagerly; "and then, oh! Miss Athol, of all men, one in the army should forever carry about with him this buckle and shield of strength!"I   ATHOL. 133 "You are all incomprehensible!"I said, a church as well as people! Nine-tenths of you go into worldly amusements and pleasures with a zest which would seem to exclude a serious thought; and yet, mention the sub- ject of Church, and all, even down to the smallest child, will start up instantly into a stalwart, towering defender of the faith. I cannot for the life of me understand it. Here is Harrie, for instance, from morning until night one would think the sole end and aim of her existence was ftin. I am younger than she, yet she wears me out with her untiring pursuit of it; and yet, say the word Church, and off she goes, as strong, if not stronger, on -that point than on anything else," and I went back to my first opinion, " it is all incomprehensible!" He looked at me musingly for a long time. "Well, you class me with Miss Harrie, I presume, in your sweeping assertions, and I do not know but your reproaches are merited; yet it is so hard when one is young and happy to be anything but gay and light-hearted, and I see nothing in God's good Word to forbid it; the Church certainly does not, and why should we, impose such heavy burdens on ourselves? If we persist in the right, and bear about with with us continually a good conscience and a sure trust, how can we be other than gay and happy?" "But gayeties sometimes result in frivolities; and you dance"                    i "So did David!" "Yes, but before the ark, and religiously as a duty." "Well, it shows he knew how, which is one point es- tablished," said Harrie in her impulsive way, bursting in upon us unaware, and she dropped down by my side with an imperative "A thol! you are too absurd! You told me last night Bishop Kip had won you over to true principles!" The captain looked down at me inquiringly. "I have been reading 'The Lenten Fast,'"I said,     134         ATHOL.   '       i "and I must confess I accept it unconditionally. I co not want to know anything more of the Church, but I will know more of the people." He leaned down and said softly, "Do not judge ne too hastily until you know me. I cannot bear that the Church should fall into disrepute, and I would condemn myself to a life of rigorous self-denial if I thought, by so doing, I could win one heart to love her-" But before he could say more John and the Marshto ls came up to hurry us home, and while we rode off in a large sleigh to the tune of merry bells, the captain and Mr. Thorn walked over to the rectory to have a quitt cigar with Guy. The next day it behooved the captain to call, and a day or two after he brought a book I had been anxious 1o read, whereat Harrie professed a vast amount of jealousy and comic despair, whenever the gentleman's name was mentioned. And then, to render my confusion more co y- plete, a few days after, while the ground was white with drifts of newly fallen snow, he drove up in an elega/nt little cutter, with prancing steeds and tinkling bells, and "would be so happy if I would take a ride." Of course I went, with sister's permission very laughingly given, and off we dashed, I carefully wrapped in robes, with de- light and excitement beaming in my eyes.    , Except the short ride home with the Marshtons oh Christmas Eve, I had never enjoyed a genuine sleigh-ride before,-this was' my first attention from a gentleman, and I began to feel I was a young lady indeed. It was by no means an unpleasant sensation, and why one of Massachusetts' sweetest poets should sing of a maiden standing  -" with reluctant feet Where the brook and river meet, Womanhood and childhood fleet,"   ATHOL.          I35 will always be to me an unexplained mystery. "Reluc- tant" indeed! It is the only piece of twaddle that man ever wrote; for where lives the woman who has not hailed with delight her first long dress,-the glory of a trail skirt,-the hair " done up " in a comb,-the first party or the first beau. So as I was only dutifully following in the footsteps of every other woman before me, I was delighted with my ride, pleased with the novelty, and proud of the captain. How much sense and nonsense we talked I cannot remember. I only know it was a pleasant ride, and very nearly dark when-we returned to the Dell. As he lifted me from the sleigh, I thanked him warmly for the pleasure he had given me. He gayly called out " an revoir," and with a wave of his cap, and bowing so low his fair breezy hair almost touched the robes, he dashed merrily down the avenue. And I stood on the porch, with my hand on the door knob and my eyes still bright with excitement, following him. "I wonder what he thinks of me," I thought to myself. "I wonder if I am gauche and ignorant. I wish I were older--had seen more of the world. He is so elegant, so graceful-and Harrie is right--he is like the 'Amal' with his tawny golden locks." All my life my heroes and heroines were fair-hair- ed, and I would have plucked mine from my benighted head at any moment, if only I could have been assured of its return to the golden tint of my babyhood. Had a dye been in existence I could have trusted, I would have plunged into it as remorselessly as ever Le- ander plunged into the Hellespont,-had a bleaching pro- cess been invented, I should have braved its fiery horrors as eagerly. It was always my pet weakness, and I watch- ed the fleet horses, the tall figure and flying robes, until they vanished down the road. Then I opened the door and hurried in. Sister was sitting by the grate in her large stuffed chair, and John stood by her side. As I w   ., ..     136         ATHOL. went in Harrie left her position by the window, and came rapidly over to me, while I knelt on the rug, warming my hands before the bright blaze. "I have been watching you," she said. "What were you doing for full five minutes, with your hands fidgeting on the door knob? ' It was dark, so no one could see my blush. I was rather ashamed, but I spoke up boldly, "Watching the captain's hair." There was a burst of laughter even froln sister, who looked at me with a puzzled face. "She is demented!"- said Harrie decisively. "A straight jacket John, if you- please." But John threw back his head, and laughed until the room rung. "What a Daisy it is," was all he said. And sister called me to her side. 'F Tell me, child, what could interest you in his hair?" "It is so beautiful," I confessed. "I see," said John, " therein lies the strength of this veritable young Samson. We can contend with ordi- nary mortals, but we are powerless before the glory and strength of this dazzling and wonderful head of hair!" "Out upon you, Philistine, I cried, "I will have my say-- "Athol 'has very good taste," said Mrs. Fleming quietly-"I think him a most gentlemanly person-" "And I," interrupted Harrie, "consider it the old fable of warming the serpent by the fire, over again. I am henceforth plunged in the deepest, direst, darkest depths of despair!" prolonging the alliterative as was her wont; " we are deadly foes from this time forward! ' and she struck a tragic attitude, and then under cover of her fire I ingloriously fled the field. But the captain called the next day to see how I bore   ATHOL.          I37 my ride and if I had taken cold, and a day or two after a party was made up for skating, and somehow, the cap- tain unconsciously fell to my lot; and so it went on front day to day and almost without knowing how it came about, we began to be very good friends. And while Alice and Guy were quietly and faithfully performing their duties,-while John was very nearly every day at Marshton Lea, and Harrie flirted alternately with Mr. Thorn and honest, sensible Dr. Truman, Cap- tain Alger vibrated like a pendulum, and about as regu- larly, between his hotel and the Dell; and wherever I went followed me about, as faithfully as my guardian's beautiful setter, which was my delight. What did I think of all this attention? Not very much--except that, for the moment his frank, manly homage pleased me. I think any girl of my age would have been an idiot if she had not been pleased. There was an irresistible charm in his careless good nature-a glitter of mirth in hi's blue eye absolutely contagious, and then this young Mars was very handsome withal--about as perfect a type of true Saxon beauty as I had ever beheld, and there was nothing, from the tie of his cravat to the polished tip of the boot, that was not faultlessly perfect and elegant,-almost approaching dap- dyism-only it stopped short-just there, before 5 reached that point. But light-hearted, gay and careleS s as he was, I knew, under it all, an even calm purpose and principle that never wavered or faltered. Young as he was, duty was the motto he had chosen for life. And some way every time I met the captain, he made me feel more and more we were old friends. Day by day he gave me his society, not as a matter of course, but it came about very naturally, without any apparent pre- meditation on his part. At last our walks and meetings' settled down into established method. It was all very     138         ATHOL. pleasant, withal bewildering. Each day I gave myself up more and more to the spell, and as John was pleased to dislike the growing intimacy, the excitement was rather pleasant than otherwise. "It was not love," I said over and over again to myself, and even as I said it, the re- membrance of a tender deference in the captain's man- ner, forced me to look the situation most soberly in the face. But I always ended in the conviction that it would prove a harmless little flirtation,--rather seductive and enlivening, but doomed in the future to dieothe death of all such little romances--die, and be forgotten. "It is not my fashion to be wretched," said Harrie, "so J shall not die over the captain's defection. I liave always a tower of defence, a sure refuge, in the doctor." "How can you be so absurd Harrie," I said, " any one to hear you, would think Captain Alger was in love with me!"  i Could one have a grain of common sense, or a pair of sharp eyes, and not see it?" she retorted. "Well, then, in spite of his years and sobriety, the doctor is quite as madly in love with you!" ' Not madly at all," she said, coolly. "It is a natural consequence-he has always felt that. My charms as an infant captivated him while yP in my nurse's arms, and hie is too old to help it at this late day." Soon after this talk as I was coming home from the rectory alone (for Harrie had gone off to the Lea with Bella Marshton) I heard quick footsteps behind me, and turning I discovered the captain. He wore a grayshoot-\ ing dress. His gun and game bag were slung carelessly over his shoulder. His dog was trotting at his side, and! bounded forward at sight of me, leaping upon me with all the glad delight a dog can express. I stooped down' and patted the broad, shaggy head, just as his master came up.  ATHOL.          I39 "Nep knows his friends," he said, as he took off his cap and gave the tangled golden curls a toss back, " there was a bond of sympathy established between you'two, I believe, dating from your first meeting."7 "I love dogs," I said--" any, and all of them." "And they know it," he returned. "They are human in their instinct of love. Once assured of it, they claim it as a right ever after." This was a poor beginning of a conversation which threatened to last until we reached the Dell, for the cap- tain was walking home with me as composedly as possi- ble, so I asked quickly, "What sport to-day?" "Nothing but a few partridges, and those hard to fipd; but look here." He opened his game bag and disclosed several squir- rel, and one poor solitary rabbit. "It is a cruel sport," I said, " and how could you find it in your heart to kill this poor little pet?" and I stroked the soft head of the dead rabbit with a great feeling of pity. "We are all pirates," he said, ' and live by preying on each other. I found this little animal destroying some- thing, and I in turn destroyed it; but he gave me a chase," and he laughed. (I wish you could have seen him jump over the snow!" And then he pulled out two or three partridges and claimed my admiration and pity for them. He was so unaffectedly intent on displaying the feath- ered treasures in his game-bag, that I felt it would be ab- surd of me to impute a deeper meaning to his attentions. "It is stuff and nonsense!"I thought, " he is more in love to-day with his dog and gun than me," and so we chatted along the highway very gayly. These frequent meetings were but the result of chance after all, I argued. I did not know that the little innocent deception of friendship     !40         ATHOL. was fast merging into something deeper with the cap- tain. L'homme propose, et Dieu dispos," and I would not look forward to the inevitable result. As we came up the hill leading to the house, he drew my- arm lightly within his own, and we walked silently so for some minutes. "Why do I linger here?" at last said the captain, and the frank, handsome face and laughing blue eyes looked down with sudden seriousness into mine. "You are weav- ing a web to entangle me, as securely as ever spider er- tangled- his prey." "I?"I said in feigned surprise, and a little flutter at my heart. "You told me once you always spent your leave of absence here with your cousins." "Why, you know," he stammered at length, "I pro- posed joining some brother officers in a deer stalking expe. dition up among the Adirondacks. There is fine sport there now. I thought to stay here two or three weeks--" "Instead of which you have been here six. You must have found your stay very pleasant!" "More than pleasant!" he said impulsively. "I leave my heart behind me when I go." "I lost my heart among these old hills from the day of my coming among them,"- I said innocently; " it is a lovely country, and dearer already to me than my own," and by this time we had reached the gate. "Will you not come in?"I asked, as he held it open for me to pass. "Not to-night, and in this garb,"' -and I thought there was a little more color in the bronzed cheek than was natural. "Then, good-night," putting out my hand, " they will think I am lost if I do not make my appearance soon." "Will you go to the village alone to-morrow again?" he asked, detaining my hand in his a moment. I came to myself with a start. Indeed, I would not    ATHOL.     .41 walk alone with him again. It was a pleasant little epi- sode to him, no doubt; but it would be forgotten as soon as a new and prettier face appeared to charm this young knight-errant. 4"Not to-morrow," I said very carelessly, as these thoughts flashed through my mind. "That is my day for studying German, and I allow nothing to interfere with that." "Well, then, the next day?" "Harrie and I are going with Alice to see her school." He bit his lip with vexation, but he persisted. "And ' still the next?" "It is too far off," I said laughingly. He still held my hand in his. I blamed myself in- wardly for according him even this privilege; but I could not resist the temptation, it was so inexpressibly amus- ing to see the unusual look of interest and vexation on the handsome face. "You are hard-hearted," he said. "You give even to a dog the favor and friendship you deny the master, and you leave me no alternative but to say 'Good-night.'" There was a tender meaning in his look and tone I could not misunderstand, but he said no more, only car- ried my hand to his lips with the chivalrous grace of a Sidney, then lifting his cap, whistled to Nep and turned down the road. I walked slowly up to the house without once turning to look back. It is the habit of these fine young officers, I thought, to fall in love, and have a des- perate flirtation at every new station. He is all that'is manly and noble, said my heart, but it is no doubt an habitual failing of his; and I put the gallant captain -out of my mind at once.  ' As I ran up the steps and opened the door, Harrie met me with a look of delight on her face. She caught     "2   -      ATHOLE  me by the waist and whirled me round after her in the i. maddest possible manner.    - "I have had a lovely day with Bella," she said; " andi  they give a party next week--a veritable grand ball-and : we are to go, Jobn and sister say we are!" and she  danced around the room in an ecstasy.      , "I am so glad," was all I could say when she c stopped to give me a breath. "Glad isn't the word! We have had such a dull old winter. Do be ecstatic, Athol! You will drive me mad with your cool Scotch blood. All I am afraid of is, I shall die before I get all the dancing I want in this world." So, while she was taking all sorts of new steps in the hall, I walked up stairs to my own room quite as wild  with delight as she. CHAPTER XI. "CHLDREN," said John the next morning, looking around the breakfast table, with somewhat the air of a benevolent gorilla Harrie said, " what are we to do? Do you want to go to this grand party at the Lea?" "Do?" and Harrie looked up quickly. "Thank a  kind heaven we are invited, and go!-my mind was made up last night-so speak for yourself Athol."  Mr. Grmme gave a " humph!" raised his newspaper re' read, then said cruelly, "I hate balls! I wish we could be let alone and never go to such places. Don't you, little Daisy " C"No, indeed," I answered boldly. "I want to go as much as Harrie." John shook his newspaper at us and tried to look savage.    ATHOL.          143 "I should love to go," I declared breathlessly. "I was never in my life at a grand ball or party, only H am afraid I have no proper dress to wear." "Of course you have not," said Harrie. "We must both have lovely new dresses, we must go to town, and John must chaperone us--" "I see," and he tried to make a horrible scowl, "it is clearly my duty. But what does sister say? Shall we let these little novicesee the world of fashion and folly, and make fine young lades of them at once, or shall we keep them in the cage a little longer?" "Sister may give her consent with as good a grace as possible," interrupted Hairie determinately, " for I mean to go." Mrs. Fleming had been listening smilingly. "And sister means you shall," she said; "John will take you to town and give you, carte:blanche, my dears, both of you, for your first party." Harrie sprang up in her headlong fashion, and threw her arms around sister's neck. "What a darling you are, and you will lend me your pink corals beside? You will never refuse me that--I shall be ravishing in them, John," and she treated him to a compulsory galop across the room, and was with difficulty placed in her seat and ordered to finish her breakfast. "I hate and abhor these balls," said John  again, after Harrie had cooled down somewhat, " and if my life is to be tormented out of me by these two young Arabs, I shall pitch my tent elsewhere, and be free at least from" such abominations." And I wish," said Harrie rapturously, "there was a ball every night. I laid awake all last night selecting my dress. It will not be the 'milkmaid's green,' but a canary-colored silk, the faintest shade, John-" "My   dear child," he interrupted, retreating toward     I44         ATHOL. the door, "spare me any further infliction until the time arrives, and talk to me of everything under heaven but dress! I shall go to town some day this week and you may both go with me, but not another word now! If I must be sacrificed, offer me up as compassionately as possible." So we talked to sister, who despite her feebleness and lack-of interest in such gayeties, was nevertheless pleased in our pleasure and -smilingly gave us our own way in everything. She had not forgotten her own happy girl- hood, and was never so content as in giving delight to others. And, for a wonder, John seemed to have given ,up all his dislike of the ball, or his position as chaperon, and, when a day or two later, he took Harrie and I to town as he had promised, he did indeed give us carte- blanche in everything. He even submitted to going the round of the shops with us, and together we viewed the ravishing delights of silk, tulle, flowers and ornaments. Harrie was wild with excitement, and consumed a vast deal of time in selecting the precise shade of her canary silk. I would not have anything but a white tulle, and Mr. Graeme commended my choice. "You shall be my foil;" said Harrie gayly, "all that fleecy cloud of lace will set off my lovely silk to infinite advantage. I, with my dark braids; you, with your brown curls. You need not twist your mouth, John, after that provoking fashion of yours. We shall be the belles of the room, and I will carry off the 'Amal,' nolens volens, as General Taylor once said." - "We shall see!"  I retorted defiantly, and John laughed at us both, and engaged as this was our first ap- pearance we would be so frightened we would never dare say a word. Harrie would not listen to his prophecies however, but went off into rhapsodies over her dress, her intended flirtations, and her expected felicity, to say noth- y   ATHOL.          145 ing of sister's pink corals she was sure she would give her. "And you, Daisy," said Mr. Graeme, "where are your ornaments?" "Oh! I have none," I answered blushing, "and I want none-" "I could have them if I wanted," he declared. "He was inclined to be generous and indulgent," and I had "better trust to the caprice of the moment," but I re- fused. The morning of the great day dawned for us at last, and directly luncheon was over, to my surprise a beauti- ful bouquet came from the captain-for me-not Harrie! That forlorn damsel feigned hysterics the entire day, every time she caught a glimpse of me. I had not seen my gallant friend since the evening we walked home from the village, and I was more than ever annoyed by Harrie's insinuations, and finally became des- perately ill-natured over her perpetual jests. I was half inclined to give up the party, when Mr. Graeme called me into the library after dinner. "You quiet little mouse," he said, when he had closed the door. "You have never had a word or look for me the entire day. Where is all your enthusiasm for this great festivity?" "I don't care anything about it," I replied perversely. "And your beautiful flowers the captain sent you?" he said, watching me under his long lashes with that quiz- zical way of his, which always resulted in reading me through and throughj like the open pages of a book. Harrie does tease me so," I confessed-" and I don't care for him in the least, handsome as he is. I would much rather the flowers had come from you." "You are a consummate little Loyalist!" he said. "I have a great mind to bind you to my service forever! 7     "6         ATHOL. Come here," and he drew me down to his side, then tak- ing a little packet from his pocket he began slowly un- wrapping it. It was sealed at both ends, and it took him some time to undo it. He watched my impatience eagerly-then opening the little case drew forth such an exquisite set of chains,-a chain for my neck and two for my arms. Nothing but delicate, spiral coils of gold, so fine, gleam- ing and beautiful. He clasped them himself and fastened the spring. ' I have a fancy," he said, " you will never take them off. You shall be my captive,--my little galley slave. What do you say, Daisy-are 'you mine forever?'" "You do not mean it," I said, averting my head, for I felt conscious I was blushing and trembling under his gaze, and I knew he was talking idly, as he did when in such moods. "You do not believe in slavery; you are always quarrelling with Dr. Truman about it." He laughed, and passed his hands caressingly through my curls. "If I want to bind you fast to me, little Daisy," he said, "it is only with golden chains; you shall never feel their weight." I abased myself before him in a profound salaam, akd mockingly asked "What commands for his slave." And he bade me "run and dress for the party," ie should take me himself, he said. John had never spoken thus to me before-so kindly, caressingly, tenderly; and my cheeks were aflame and my heart beat delightedly; yet, for all that, I knew, with a strange sinking, that it was only the caprice of the moment which made him so tender. What was I to him but his ward, his cousin? What would I ever he but a favorite toy, a plaything? But for the moment, intoxicated with joy, I felt that he was simply my all, and in all--my life  I   ATHOL.         I47 This was my first ornament, and John had given it to me, and I danced off gayly to Harrie, and displayed my treasures.  it is just like John!'" she said, and she pointed mean gly to the clasps. There was his crest, and in tiny little letters, his own motto engraven thereon-"Ten eo o "It is just like him! He is never contented unless he owns every one, body and soul; he will make you feel your chains, gilded as they are! I am glad he did not give them to me; I would rather have the captain's flowers!" she said wickedly, for she knew how her jesting vexed me. "Then take them!"I retorted, kindling with sudden anger, and I threw them out of the vase on, the floor at her feet, stamping the red life out of the roses with an impulse I could not resist. She looked at me with a perplexed air of astonish- ment as she stooped, taking up the crushed flowers. "If you would only ' count twenty Tattycorum!" she said soberly. "You will be ashamed of yourself by and by. Now you have no bouquet. What excuse will you offer the Amal?" "Say I forgot them!" "Do it, and I will tell what a villanous temper you have." I was vexed and mortified already, that I should have given way to such a burst of childish anger, so I went off to my own room, and pretending to be engaged with my dress, did not come down until I had recovered my equa- nimity, and the carriage stood waiting at the door. Of course we had to go to sister, who inspected us with smiling approval in her sweet tender way, adding the much desired corals to Harrie's toilet, who offered to sing a "Jubilate " on the spot. "You are quite perfect," she said at length, kissing     "8         ATHOL. us. "Go and enjoy it all. Life is so bright when we are young." John smilingly declared he was proud to be our chap - eron, as he wrapped his sister's cloak about her, and turn- ing to do the like office for me, asked abruptly:  "Where is your bouquet, Daisy?" "It was not a bouquet as we supposed,'" said Harrie gravely, " it was a bunch of apples from Sodom, and they  fell to ashes at the touch." Sister looked up to me in a puzzled way for a sOlu- - tion of the mystery, but I bounded out of the door And i was in the carriage before John could assist me.  Don't waltz," was his sole request as we rolled up i the broad gravelled avenue. "If there is anything detes- table, it is the liberties young ladies tolerate now-a- I days."  "Miss Marshton waltzes," said Harrie. "I have seen her lots of times!"  "Let her," he returned. "I do not want you to,-or, my little Daisy here--be my good little novices, and prom- ise you will not ape these fine, worldly ladies, all at once." "I will," said Harrie-" if I can keep my feet still, if not, don't blame me, brother!" "And I would not dare," I said. "I never took a dancing lesson in my life--' "You know I have taught you," Harrie interrupted. "How can you be so ungrateful?  "But I would never dare before so many," I reiterated -"beside, no one will ask me." But as John lifted me from the carriage and pulled my cloak more closely around me, he whispered, "Re- member your promise," and I had'only time to whisper in return, "You have but to command me, you know," and then the great hall door was thrown open, and Edith music sounding in our ears, and a burst of light flooding   ATHOL.          149 the grand hall crowded with revellers, we ran gayly up the wide staircase. Of course it was a great party. For me it was a glimpse of a life of enchantment, the pleasures of which I never even dimly imagined. Never before had I seen gathered together so much elegance of dress or beauty. Miss Marshton was surpassingly lovely, and received her guests with an ease and grace that spoke of long acquain- tiance with the world. There was some empressment in in her manner I thought, as she came forward to greet us, and I did not wonder John was completely fascinated. She was beautiful as a dream indeed, with a face and form faultless and classic as the sculptured marble of the old masters. There is a world of power in beauty, and a beautiful woman who dresses well possesses uncounted charms. Young as I was, I saw at a glance she knew her power, and meant to use it. We had barely made the tour of the rooms when Cap- tain Alger, in all the glory of a full dress toilet, came up and begged me from Mr. Greme for the "Lanciers," just forming. He gave me up. I fancied only too willingly, and was at Miss Marshton's side in an instant, and Harrie accepting Mr. Thorn, falling to her lot as he usually did, we found ourselves vis-d-vis in the dance forming, and contrary to my predictions, were as much at ease and dancing as gayly, as if such a thing as a first party had never been dreamed of or dreaded. I felt rather proud of my partner, in spite of my pique at my guardian giving me up so readily, for there was always an irresistible charm to me in the " brass buttons," and the captain was, to say the least, very handsome. "Where is your bouquet?" he whispered, the first time we paused in the dance. "I thought you would carry it "-and in a tone that I only could hear, added "for my sake."     1'50        ATHOL. "H lost it," I stammered. Harrie passing me just then in a chass, gave me a hor- rible wink which the captain could not avoid seeing. "It is only the old story of Sodom and Gomorrah," she explained. "Athol fled the doomed city and her bouquet perished in the ruins." Fortunately some basket-work arrangement, I believe they call it, cut her explanations short to my infinite re- lief. When I came back to his side again, I said hurriedly, answering his pained, perplexed look, "I throw myself upon your mercy entirely,-" believe n e if the flowers perished, it was not because I forgot the kiver." "I would be willingto share their fate," he whispered, "if it was by your hand they perished." There was a strange intonation in his voice which brought the color to my cheeks painfully. What had I been saying in my confusion, and where were my good resolutions concerning this young knight-errant gone? I was glad when the figure ended, and leading me to a seat, he claimed Harrie for the next quadrille, and I w s alone and at liberty to look around me. Almost the first thing I did was to sweep the room in one swift glance, to discover the two people above all others in whom I was most interested; Miss Marshton and my guardian. They were walking slowly through the room, he bending down and looking in her face with an expression I knew but too well-the same look he wore only a few hours before in the library, when he said, "What do you say, little Daisy-will you be mine forever?"It was not long before they passed me. He did not see me, but I heard him say in his distinct, well modulated, tender tone -"I shall not wander away again. Even were it not Mrs. Fleming's health which detains me, I have now other and stronger considerations-" and I caught no more,-but it    ATIOL.          15i was quite enough to raise a storm of jealousy, wild and poignant as it was unreasonable. I looked at his speaking eyes, his bent head, the tender earnestness of his manner. I looked at myself in the mirror opposite, and saw only a young, childish face, with nothing to recommend it but the freshness of youth. Alas! for the wonderful white tulle! It was merely an in- significant, unpretending apparel in the midst of so much that was elegant and magnificent, and a great feeling of disappointment came over me, so I turned my eyes away from lthe uninteresting reflection in the glass and sought out my guardian again. Very soon they came slowly past me. I held my breath. I listened eagerly. I looked at her. She was by far the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. Her dress was one cloud-like mass of tulle,-bril- liants were on her neck and flashed from the masses of lace on her bosom; and on her gleaming, round arms, rare jewels glittered resplendent. Her face was pale and beautiful in its marble whiteness, as a chiselled dream of Cleopatra, and made almost glorious and regal by the aureole of golden hair. There was not one thing lacking in her delicate, graceful costume. To her dress was Art, and she studied it with the faultless eye of an artist. She was toying with her fan as they passed me. Her blue eyes looked triumphantly in his. "I thought you never danced," she was saying. "I have no resource left, since it is the only way to detain you," he answered. She laughed and shook her head. "I will not accept an unwilling captive." He smiled and bowed low, while his arm encircled her waist. "The chains you weave are silken, and I shall not feel them," I heard him say in a low, tender voice; and resting her tiny, jewelled hand upon his shoulder, they floated     152         ATHOL. down the'room and were lost in the maze of giddy danc- ers. I followed them with my eyes. "He will not let us waltz," I thought with rising indignation, " and has forgot- ten us as completely as if he had never brought us here." Just then, Captain Alger brought Harrie to a seat by my side. That young lady was ecstatic. She had flirted with the captain, Mr. Thorn, and Dr. Truman all together, and the poor honest hearted doctor I could see, was quite beside himself with her caprices and absurdities. We are all playing at cross purposes, I thought. Here is the worthy doctor just as madly in love with Harrie as- and I would not even to myself finish the sentence, but taking Captain Alger's proffered arm, joined the prom- enade. The evening waned all too quickly. It was new, be! wildering, delightful-but like all pleasures it soon fled. I had danced six consecutive dances with the captain, twice with Mr. Thorn, and once even with my friend the doctor "I was receiving as much attention as any girl in the room after all," my heart said with a delighted flutter that was quite new to me. But not once did John come near me through that evening. Once in passing me, he said gayly, " he was glad to, see me in such good care," but ap- parently he had thought for no one beyond Miss Marsh- ton.  I began with a feeling of pique which ended in downright anger. I was surely looking my best, but he scarcely seemed aware of my existence. "I will make him see me before the evening is out," I thought, and when the captain proposed a Redowa, I yielded immedi- ately, and before I could think what I was doing, his arm was around me and we were flying with the giddy dancers down the room. I was wild with excitement; my cheeks burned pain- fully; my eyes were bright. I was aghast at my own boldness, for even Harrie, defiant and wilful, had re-   I      -  - ;IATHOL.         5 3 mained true to her promise, and looked at me in unfeigned amazement as I went whirling by her, the long fair mus- tache of the "nAmal"Almost brushing my face. As with fleet feet we passed before my guardian, I caught in one swift glance the sudden change in his face. He was so near he could have put out his hand and stopped me, but he drew back from even the sweep of my gauze dress. It was only one look-like a flash--stern, sudden anger. j "Just one turn more," begged the captain, his arm still around my waist; and away we dashed, farther than ever from my guardian-as far from his presence as his heart. Not till the music ceased did we stop. My curls had be- come entangled in one of the captain's brass buttons. It took him some time to detach it, but I, knowing John's eyes were fixed on me, tore it away, leaving quite a long tress hanging to it. ( Let us leave the dancing," he whispered, "we will return in time for a galop." "I will not dance any more," I said abruptly'; "I am tired." The captain laughingly rallied me on my sudden fa- l tigue. "Come in here," he said, " in the library, and rest for a moment while I bring you an ice. I have something to say to you I have not had the heart to say before." "No bad news!"I answered laughingly, "I will hear nothing that will mar the pleasure of to-night!" with a sudden odd feeling in my heart which threatened to suffocate me, but I laid my hand upon- his arm quite nonchalantly, and we passed through the crowded draw- ing-room, away from the noise and crash of music, to the cool quiet of the library beyond. "What a lovely ball!"I said, looking back towards the salon and just for the sake of saying something, the position was so new. He brought me my ice, and seating 7*     154         ATHOL. himself on a fauteul before me, answered without hesitL- tion, "A charming ball, indeed!" then lower, "I shall never forget it, Miss Athol; half of the bitterness of parting is lost in the remembrances I shall carry awa with me."                    I Was this what the captain wished to say? It could certainly be nothing very frivolous or foolish, for his face was quite grave and earnest as he looked at me. "You surely are not going to leave-us?"I very pru- dently added, and I returned his glance quite com- posedly. c' I have been wanting to tell you the whole evening," he said. "You know the unsettled state of the country and war seems inevitable. I am ordered to report at Washington, and I must leave to-morrow. It may be nothing, but I fancy I shall be sent somewhere not very near Brookdell, just when I had begun feeling it was the place above all others where I would be." There was a meaning in his eye, a tremulously uncer- tain look about the handsome mouth, that showed me he was in earnest. A woman is always cooler than a mar about these things, and then my vanity was touched- very true-but my heart was my own yet. "Don't be sentimental!"I said, looking up appeal- ingly. "I'm too matter-of-fact to be that," and he twisted his long, fair mustache restlessly, " but it is hard to go." "I hate good-byes," I said. "The French have a much prettier way of expressing those things than we have," and if he thought I was going to blush, or bandy sentiments with him, he found himself mistaken. "I may write to you?" he asked, after a minute's si- lence. "If you like, and have anything to say." He bit his lip.   / ATHOL.         155 "Are you so hard in all your friendships, Miss Athol?" he inquired. I played with my bracelets, and turned the clasps up to him. "Do you not see my motto?"I asked. I knew he liked me. I also knew I had the better of him, for I didn't care a pin, that is, in the way he wanted me to, for him. "Will you stamp our friendship with that motto?" he said, looking down at the bracelet. "No indeed!" very innocently. "I will not give my- self up to unlimited friendship, until I have thoroughly tried and proven it." What a world it is," he said absently. "I was never more busy with ' Chateau en Espagne,' than I have been for the last two or three weeks, and you, ungrateful girl, have demolished it all at one stroke " "Yes," I answered coolly. "I was always destructive -I cannot even resist a bouquet " "And will you remember me at all?" he asked, ig- noring my last remark. I assumed as much age and dignity as I could possibly muster. "Let us talk common-sense at once! I shall indeed remember you as a sincere, kind friend-and after to-night'sl enchantment-a most agreeable partner. Hark! Is not that the galop?" I started up, but he took no notice of my desire to join the dancers. I stood waiting before him a moment. "I hardly know how to part with you," he said after this little pause. "How?-Why say good-bye this way "-I held out my hand, cool as ice--his hot fingers closed on mine-"I shall say-' I hope we may have the pleasure of meeting again,'" dropping before him an instant in a profound courtesy,-" then round it off with a little meaningless French phrase-say adieu, au revoir, if you will. It's easy enough!" and I coolly withdrew my hand..     1-56         ATHOL. "As you Will," he said. "I will try for your sake and make it cold enough." I dared not raise my eyes to his, so I quite turned my face from him.  "You will forgive me my presumption," he went on  hurriedly, "and say farewell to me as a true friend. I  shall be utterly miserable unless we part as such."  I laid my hand in his, but I said not a word. He gave  it a silent pressure, then we went in through the long win- dows.                         i- The band was playing  deliciously the "Strauss  Waltzes." "Only once more," the captain begged, "it  I will be our very last,"-but just then Harrie came up with  Dr. Truman. "What an elegant time!" she said impulsively, "but brother says we must go, though I have not danced the half I intended! Come," and taking Captain Alger's proffered arm, we all went up to Miss Marshton and made  our adieus. She was talking gayly to a group of gentlemen, John was among them. He held her bouquet and fan, and I knew had been saying more nonsense to her than any other gentleman in the room. I was hot and indignant, but if I had gone through two or three seasons, I could not have felt more entirely at ease than I did then. "How will he take me home," I thought, but he settled my doubt without a moment's hesitation, and coldly draw- ing my arm within his own we left the room. I had not spoken to the captain since Harrie inter- rupted us, and John gave me no time to say "Good-bye," but he stood on the steps as I ran down to the carriage, my arm within my guardian's. I slipped out quickly-- gave no heed to his stern and surprised "Athol!" and in a moment I had desperately put my hand in his. "Fare thee well! if snot forever-"   ATHOL.         I57 He would not let me finish it. "You are sentimental, now," he retaliated. "I will simply say, as you bade me, adieu, au-" But I tore my hand from his, and was by Harrie's side in an instant. And, by the light w'hich streamed from the doorway, I saw Geoffrey standing as I had left him, cap in hand, waving the farewell I had not given him time to speak. Not a word did John give me on that ride home; not a word or a look. He sat opposite Harrie and me, wrapped in his cloak, and by the light of the carriage lamps I could see his face looked very stern and uncom- promising. I emulated his example, and, leaning back, shut my eyes, feigning sleep. But all my pride flamed in my heart, as I reflected how unmaidenly I must seem to John, as well as to the captain, when I ran back to say the good-bye he had begged me for in the library. My self-accusations resulted in thorough wretchedness by the time we reached the Dell. I had done something dread- ful, no doubt, ignorant little thing that I was, and John not only felt anger, but shame as well. And then my broken promise to him; I did ot care so much for that, if only I could have assured myself of the propriety of my latest act of insubordination. When the carriage stopped, Mr. Graeme lifted us out in the same silence, took his latch-key from his pocket, and opened the door.' There was a dim light burning in the hall, and two lamps ready for Harrie and me. I caught one up hastily, and without waiting for a word, bounded up the staircase. Harrie was right behind me. She stopped me as I laid my hand on my door-knob. The lamplight fell on her perplexed face. "I don't understand you, at all," she said; ' for Heaven's sake, what has possessed you this night?" "The spirit of a woman!"I answered promptly, and slammed my door in her face.     I58         ATHOL. CHAPTER XII.  excuse to sleep," I said to myself, " and will not meet Mr. Groeme." Presently Harrie rapped, then put her head in the door. I kept my eyes closed and breathed very regu- larly.  She softly shut the door and went out. I heard the rustle of her dress sweeping down  the staircase. Then I opened my eyes and began the most miserable self-accusations. The passion and excitement of the night before was all gone; things look so differently in cool thoughts, and by daylight. And now, how was I to face Mr. Graeme?  He had been angry with me  once before--would he forgive me again as readily? Presently, while I was torturing myself with these un- quiet thoughts, I heard Harrie's step coming up the stair- case again; again she tapped softly. I dashed my head between the pillows and lay perfectly still. She came up to the bed noiselessly and whispered, "Sick, Athol?"I shook my head, with a faint attempt at denial, but did not open my eyes. "What can I  do for you?" "Nothing." "What shall I say to John? He asked for you, and is prowling around with the air of a Giant Grim." "Let him prowl," I said, crossly and desperately.   ATHOL.          159 She waited a moment; then began again. "Does your head ache?" "Yes," seizing at the subterfuge readily. "What makes it ache?" she persisted. "Because it wants to, I suppose," gruffly, and under the pillows. "Sweet pet! What a lovely temper it has!"And then changing her tone: "And the Amal has gone! I saw him drive by with Mr. Thorn and his valise. I was at the gate, when he saw me, and called out 'good-bye! ' and gave me a last flitting glimpse of his yellow locks. I tell you in the sunlight he shone as if he were transfig- ured!" "I am glad he is gone," I said, and then I resolutely sealed my lips, and not another word could she get out of me. When the lunch bell sounded I still lay in my bed. Harrie, in spite of my ill humor, brought me with her own hands a tray with a delicate piece of crisp toast and a cup of tea, and sat down on the bed by my side while I dis- posed of it. I was the first to break the silence this time. There was no use trying to feign sickness longer. I looked up in her face impulsively, and said, while I could not resist a smile, "What shall I do, Hal? And for pity's sake, tell me what John has said." "Not one word! And now in return, do tell me-for I am dying to talk over the party, and all that--what pos- sessed you? I have been so aghast ever since I saw you flying down the room in that Goth's arms, that I haven't been able to say a sensible word since!" "Some mad spirit; I can no more tell than you. And now what shall I do? How meet John, or even sis- ter, for she must know all about it?" "Not she," said Harrie. "She fancies you are tired     i6o         ATHOL, out with the unusual excitement and willing to sleep it off. She was not at breakfast when John asked for you, and you need only tell her how charming a ball it proved, leaving out the forgotten proprieties. John will never say a word about it; but you are a bold girl to face him as you did last night! And you flirted with the Amal-I  saw you. And I must confess I sat petrified in the car- riage when you ran up the steps to say a last good-night." I laughed, but all the time I felt ashamed of it. "If John had not been in a white heat of rage, and quite beyond the power of speech, there would have been an outhurst. I can tell you he has been in a villanous temper all day." "Then I will not go down until dusk,' I said; "I can never face him in broad daylight." But I got up and dressed, and presently, when I saw John leave the house and go toward the village, Harrie and I went down to sister, and together we talked over all the delights of the evening before. But I feared every instant Mr. Graeme would come in. I knew I could not meet his eye. I kept dreading the summons to dinner,  which would bring us all together again. Then I wan- dered off into the drawing-room, where John rarely if ever came, and sat down in the window-seat. I took a book  from the table and tried to read, but my eyes vacantly  ranged from line to line, and I took no sense of the words. My mind was not there, and I parted the soft lace curtain and looked out. The swift winter night was fast falling. The room was grey with shadows already, but outside the fading golden light pierced through the leafless trees, and brought out every feature of the land- scape, white and still, the window framing it in like a pic- ture. I leaned my face against the glass vacantly, idly thinking. Presently I saw John walking slowly up the path.   ATHOL.         161 His hands were behind him, his head bent forward in thought, his slouching hat concealing his face. He did not look up as he passed the window, but going through the hall, went on to his own room. I looked up at the great bronze clock on the mantel. An hour to dinner, and I thought again " how shall I meet him? 7 Just then Harrie came in with a sweep and flutter. She looked around, spied me, and came over rapidly to the window-seat. "John wants you," and she gave me a grimace which ended in a laugh. ' He is in the library. Pax Vobis- cum," and her uplifted hands would have rested on my head, but I dashed past her without waiting to give her a word. "Now for it," I thought with all my blood rushing tu- multuously to my heart, but I threw back my head and put on my most defiant, wilful air, as I groped my way through the dim hall. I stopped just one moment with my hand on the library door, then opened it with an admonitory tap and walked in. He did not heed my rap-he did not notice me when I came in. He was standing before the grate, leaning on the mantel in an attitude of abstraction. Ponto lay stretched on the rug at his feet. He raised his shaggy head and gave me a sleepy wag of recognition. Still Mr. Graeme did not lift his eyes, so I went over to where the dog lay, grateful to the dear old brute for even this notice. I dropped on the rug by his side. I took his long silken ears in my hand, stroking them and giving him kisses without number. Ponto and I were accepted lovers dating from my ar- rival at Brookdell. It was always an inherent part of my nature to love dogs. Most women of feminine instincts have their hobbies-generally children, or flowers, or some other dainty and proper tendency, but-to my shame be it spoken, nothing demanded or received quite so \           ' o     162         ATHOL. large a share of my affection and patronage as the whole  canine race, irrespective of blood, size or color. From the largest and most powerful of its kind down to the ver- iest squeaking puppy, all effected an immediate entrance through the open door of my heart. I clasped the dog about the neck, and laid my burning cheeks on his silky head, whispering all the dainty diminutives I could think  of. He thumped the floor delightedly with his shaggy tail,  and bore the caresses and adjectives like a philosopher.  I knew Mr. Gramte was watching me. I saw him half turn, looking down upon me, and I redoubled my demon-  strations. He waited until my vocabulary was exhausted,- then said sullenly and coldly, "Perhaps you will be will- ing now to consider something of more importance than the length of Ponto's ears. I sent for you, you will re- member."  "Certainly," my tone as chilling as his own. "Go on, if you please." I raised my head for the first time since I entered the room, and looked up at him with a tumult of varying emotions struggling in my heart. His arms were folded across his breast and he looked down upon me with a cold glitter in his black eyes, and an air of the most lofty displeasure in his whole face. I thought, "last night, about this time, he was saying, with a very different expression, ' Little Daisy will you be mine forever."' But I returned him a look equally cold. "I have been forced to remind you once before, Athol," he said sternly, "of my power over you as a  guardian. I am forced to do so a second time. It is a thankless task, but I am bound by a promise to the dead as well as to the living; and in the future, since my wishes are not respected, I shall resort to commands." I held up my arms to him where the bracelets he had himself fastened, still glittered.   ATHOL.         163 "Take them off then," I cried with crimson cheeks, and all the fire and vehemence of youth-"The chains were 'to be golden and I was not to feel their might'-- but these are searing my very flesh! The shackles of the Inquisition were far easier borne! Take them off!" I commanded. "Child," and he looked half frightened at my sudden fury, although his tone was as firm as ever. "I will not take them off and you shall obey me. At least until my power over you as your guardian ends." I dropped my hands in my lap and sat in obstinate silence. "What have I done," he went on, " to cause such wil- ful defiance-such ingratitude? Wherein have I failed in discharging my duty as father, guardian, brother or friend? How have I merited your coldness, your disobedience and caprice? Tell me, Athol, this instant, what such conduct means." "It means," I said, " that I will no longer be a child in your eyes, and subject to your commands and caprices. I am a woman-capable of giving affection for affection, neglect for neglect, and scorn for scorn!" and my voice trembled with passion as I spoke. He looked down at me for an instant, with a relenting shade on his cold, handsome face. "What, little one!" and his voice lost some of its sternness, "what-jealous again? Did I indeed neglect you? Tell me-By Jove, child, I believe I am more than half to blame in this matter myself!" "Oh, a Daniel come to judgment! yea a Daniel! Oh, wise young Judge, how do I honor thee!"I quoted. The red light flushed his cheek and his eye sparkled. He turned suddenly from me. "Athol, how dare you mock me thus!" "I dare do anything," I said boldly, "anything that     164         ATHOL. will remind you, as it did last night, of my most worthless existence! I thought then and still clearly see-" He finished the sentence for me-" fit to. disobey your lawfully appointed guardian, you would say," and the an- gry light kindled his face again. "You should be the last one to upbraid me," I said hurriedly, " you of all people in the world! If I have of- fended, if I have disobeyed you, it is only in that your cold-  ness and neglect have estranged me. You pet and spoil  me at one moment like a little child. You control and oppose me with a caprice that is unendurable. You load  me with shackles and yet forget that I am in existence  and wearing them! I am not a child, I am a woman- only treat me as such!" He bit his lip and changed color. I saw my advantage and pursued it. "I am childish, weak and impulsive, you will say- grant it-but I am also grateful, sensitive and proud, like yourself-do not try me too far." A long pause followed during which John looked fix- edly in the fire. "So I have been ungenerous?" he said at length. "And exacting," I interpolated. "It is your pet foible -your besetting sin! You have ruled and governed all your life, and you cannot bear even a wilful girl to op- pose you!" He turned suddenly and held out his arms to me. "Do not fix a gulf between us child, so that neither can pass. Come here to me-talk to me-as you ought to one who loves you and has the right of guardianship over you. Come here to me, my little Daisy." But I did not stir. If caprice was John's weakness, obstinacy was mine. I would not let him see his power over me. I would not yield to him yet. "And she will not come to me," he said, reproach-   ATHOL.         l65 ! fully. "My little Daisy, because I have neglected, and been harsh with her, will no longer love me!" "Just now I love Ponto," I answered, "and my 'law- fully appointed guardian' has set me the example of lov- ing but one at a time!" and I hid my face in the dog's shaggy hair, to hide the laugh that was trembling on my lips, for I knew now his passion was over, he would be more caressing and tender than ever. There was a minute's vexed silence-then he drew up a chair close to my side, and putting his head very nearly on a level with mine, he reluctantly compelled my eyes to meet his. "Now Daisy, mind this. You said you were a woman just now,-be a rational one. I am in a very practical mood to-night, and if that brute stands in my way I will put him out." He spoke pleasantly but decidedly. He called me Daisy-so-we were getting on the old level again, and as, with us both, our angry passions had ebbed slowly away, I instantly accepted his mood as mine. ' am practical and common-sense too,--I will hear all you have to say, and I will answer you as well as I can." "Good. In the first place you are young. You have seen so little of the world you know absolutely nothing of its temptations. It is a new, intoxicating pleasure to step for the first time in the charmed circle of society. I only ,ask you to enter it guardedly, remembering your youth and inexperience ; remembering that if I check you-if I seem harsh and exacting, it is only with the tender jeal- ousy of a father." "You looked fatherly last night," I interrupted, mali- ciously "waltzing with Miss Marshton, and setting such an example to your children!" He gave me a glance of quick reproach, and I thought under his breath I heard him consigning her to the devil. I had the better of him again. 1     -66         ATHOL. "How can you swear?"I interrogated.  "What would sister and Alice say?" "It is not my fault-you should give me no cause-- besides, I was not swearing!" "It is a bad example to set before a child-a rude as well as wicked one!" "Just now yohi were a woman," He retorted. "Then treat me as a woman-and give up a father's advice." He pushed me from him with anything but a paternal look. Was this all he had called me into the library for? I turned to him impatient and indignant. (' You are as capricious as a woman, and exacting as a spoiled child, and you are much too old to be indulged in either!" "I am not so old that I am in my dotage," he returned with a look of pique. Then after a minute's pause-" you have a disagreeable habit of forcing unpleasant truths on one." I gave my shoulders a little shrug. "The fact has been forced on me too often to night, for me to forget it at once. Age ought not to be dis- agreeable since years bring wisdom you say-" "If there is any one thing in life more disagreeable than another itis a pert child!" he retorted shortly. "I find age and wisdom quite as insufferable," and I could not avoid laughing. "Let us make a compact, little one," he said, dropping his vexed tone-" now and here. I must rule; I must govern. If it is my pet foible as you say, it is also a posi- tion which circumstances have forced upon me. Only try and please me,-a little, a very little, and I will also try and be less exacting as your guardian. You shall not feel your 'shackles' if I can help it." I shook the golden baubles on-my arm, "clanking my   ATHOL.         167 weary chain " in his face, with a wilful perversity natural to me. He threw his arm around me and held me closely to him with his old tender way. In a moment I was con- quered. "Do not be angry with me ever again," I whispered, and I leaned my head on his shoulder, " do not look at me or speak to me coldly again, and I will try and be all you would like me to be." He leaned down, kissing me on my forehead and put- ting back my curls. He was his old kind self again, and I was so glad to regain his favor that I could only cling more closely to him, although I knew his mood would not last long. It never did. The first act of insubordina- tion, no matter how trifling, he would be chilling and ex- acting again. And yet, only thankful for the present, I clung to him, nestling to his side in a tumult of happiness which I felt half angry with myself for feeling. Ponto at this stage of affairs instantly took the ag- grieved part, and rubbed his head importunately against my hand. Mr. Graeme pushed him off. "I want you all to myself just now, and that insensate dog is a positive intruder." Then he whispered softly: "I could not be angry with you long, even if I would, little one. But you must remember our compact, and in the future there will be no more shadows to darken our confidence and trust in each other. What do you say?" I didn't say anything, although in my heart I felt his kindness, but I was too perverse to express it. So, as there was a pause of several minutes, I amused myself by twisting Pont's ears into a perfect corkscrew; whereat he whined piteously, and walked away out of reach of my hand. Mr. Graeme turned up my face to his. "Not wilful again?" and I laughed-a contented, happy laugh, and hid my face on his shoulder. "You     i68         ATHOL. know I love you," I confessed, "and will do everything to please you." "Only I must not waltz with Miss Marshton again?" "Not that alone; you must not look at her as I saw you," I said.  "Look how? What wonderful thing did you read in my face, little one? Come, let me see if you are a physi- ognomist?" "If any man looked at me in that way," I said boldly, "I should read 'I love you,' without the aid of an inter- preter." "Pshaw!" but there was a little smile hovering around the mouth I did not like. "You little goosie, I am looking at you just that same way now, and you do not thus interpret it." "You look as if you were making fun of me," I re- torted with crimsoning cheeks, "and you certainly did not indulge in such expression with Miss Marshton." "Beside," he went on, "I have my arm around you- so-I press you to me close; and I kiss you again, and again," suiting the action to the word, " and yet you will not acknowledge I love you " "And..you are forgetting your age and wisdom; the bughear you terrify me with when I am too presuming, you know." And then he called me a little goosie again, and fell to petting and teasing me alternately; so that I was glad and startled, too, at finding how the hour had fled when the bell sounded for dinner. John drew my arm within his own, and laughed as he looked down at me. "Little lady, if I am to hand you in to dinner with the dignity your impertinence demands, you must add a few inches to your height, or you will not reach my heart.'    ATHOL.          169 (Must I reach it this way?" and I raised myself on tiptoe. He passed his arm around my waist, "putting me down to my proper level," he said, and he walked thus through the dimly lighted hall to the dining-room. Har- rie stood at the table waiting. She had been fidgeting in my absence, I knew, but when we entered the room, his arm still around me, and everything in his look and man- ner bespeaking the most perfect reconciliation, she gave a keen look of amazement-a look of inquiry as well as of amazement, which I answered with one of triumph. "What!" she said with her usual rapidity, "made up agaihn! There is nothing for me to do, but assume the position of penitent too, if I wish to gain your favor. John, shrive me as well as Athol! I will put up with such preference no longer! If I have committed any fault, in thought, word or deed, I pray your reverence to grant me too absolution for the past and indulgence for the future," and she made a mock gesture of humility, which attitude was so unusual we could not refrain from laughing heartily. But Mr. Graeme only said "Get up, you silly child." "Not until you extend the sceptre of your forgive- ness! I am  prostrate before you in sackcloth and ashes." He stepped back into the hall and brought from thence his light walking-cane, threatening to use it with such a will that she was compelled to spring aside. "Oh, very well!" and she walked off with an air of offended dignity. If I was only little like Athol, and could be made a pet and plaything, I wouldn't despair of the royal indulgence yet; but my five feet some inches forbids the descent. But you are spoiling her, brother John. I tell you ingrat- itude lies dormant in every woman's heart-she will be ready to disobey you to-morrow!" 8     I 70      -  ATHOL. I entered a disclaimer while Mr. Groeme waved his cane defiantly. "She is on good behavior, you understand, and unless you inculcate your doctrines vigorously will be docile in the future as now.' "You will have the thanks of the family if you succeed in taming her," retorted Harrie, cc and I will give you mine to begin with." - Just then soup was served, and we all sat down to its discussion with the -gravest possible decorum. And so peace came down and abode with us--for that night at least. CHAPTER XIII. JUST about this time the low mutterings of war, which 'had been heard faintly in the distance for so long a tinle, seemed to grow suddenly more distinct and portentous. Faction and treason were stalking stealthily throughout the land. The daily papers were full of discussion And startling accounts of Southron defection and action. We heard a vast deal of the " irrepressible " on both sides of the- question, for John and the doctor were opponents politically, and both somewhat of extremists. I knew about as much of the great issue at hand as Ponto, but I took sides with John right loyally, and there seemed little else to do but listen and join in their debates. It was a stupid time, as Harrie said, and we both groaned in spirit over our vanished joys, for with Captain Alger's departure a great quiet had fallen upon us all. There were no parties, no sleigh-rides or skating excur- sions-in fact there was no one to pay us any attention,   ATHOL.          I for even Mr. Thorn had gone off to the city--consequently we fellnto no errors and I was a 1" model of deportment," as well as of obedience to John. The two Marshton'-girls came over to see us quite often, and John still haunted the Lea, but his visits were fitful as his moods. Some- times a week would go by without his leaving the house. At such times he was all devotion to us, then a little dainty note would arrive, recalling him suddenly to a sense of duty, and we would not see him for days and days ex- cept at breakfast or tea. Harrie and I from very weari- ness had given up our jealous warfare and settled down quietly to our music and German, so that our visits to the rectory became at once an amusement and consola'on. Mr. Fotheringham had long ago ceased to be simply Mr. Fotheringham and a clergyman, of whose vocation I had always stood a little in awe. He was a dear friend and kind brother to me already, and I never thought of calling him anything but Guy. And then their home was such a bright pleasant little spot to flee to, and their affection, one for the other, so unlike the maudlin sentiment of most young married people, that it was a delight but to see it. And Guy was so earnest and hopeful; so full of grand re- forms and high aspirations, and Alice was so loving and helpful, and both went about bearing one another's bur- dens so cheerfully that we could not be with them very long without loving them in return. And then Guy was naturally so gentle, even without Alice's influence, but with it he could not fail of becoming the most winning and companionable of tutors, the most delightful of friends. And all this time not one word did I hear from the Amal! "He might write," I had told him, " if he had anything to say." Very evidently he had not!  "I am glad I acted as I did," I thought with something of a flush of pique at the silence I had not expected. Once I had asked Bella Marshton very carelessly  " if she had heard from her     I72          ATHOL. cousin?" "Not directly," she replied. She believed he was off on the frontier somewhere. "Fighting the Indians?" "Making love to the squaws, more likely," said Har- rie "trust me he will find his Pelagia." "My cousin is all that is noble and true," returned little Lizzie, firing up in the captain's behalf. "He is a gentleman and a Christian-" "If he is a heretic in your eyes." But Lizzie did not answer this last sally. She was the only one of the family tinctured with Romanism, and it was- Bella's delight to consign the whole family to purga- tory. "It was such a comfortable doctrine for Lizzie," she declared. And this was all I heard of my quondam admirer- the veriest nothing at all. Of course he had forgotten me. Tant mieux. I could forget him. And I set about it at once. The winter was wearing swiftly away. Day after day it glided on almost imperceptibly, the calm wave of do- mestic life bearing us with it as serenely as if under its smooth, unruffled surface there were no other current, strong and swift, rapid and remorseless as fate. We all felt anxious, and yet no one could go back to the precise time when sister appeared more ailing than usual, or when she gave up coming to breakfast or dinner with the family. It had become so infrequent that when it ceased altogether we hardly gave it a thought. And, in the long winter evenings, when the lounge was rolled out before the ruddy grate, she joined us, and tea was served after our old informal manner-when we each took our own cup and saucer and sat where we pleased, and Harrie made toast for us all before the glowing coals-and I curled up on the rug with Ponto's cold, importunate nope rubbing against my hands-the sharer of my toast arid   ATHOL.         173 cake-and John in our midst; it was all so pleasant, so cheerful, how could a thought of anxiety intrude! So long as Grace could be with us evenings John seemed unconscious and content. From this time of family re- union he was rarely if ever absent. Sister expected him, and that for John was enough. It was curious to watch them together. They were tmore like lovers to my mind, than mere brother and sister. No matter how languid or weak she had been through the day, when she heard his firm, quick step how her eye brightened and her cheek flushed. I think she knew her disease was incurable and she was gradually wasting away, but she never spoke of it to us. John could not bear her even in the most re- mote manner to speak of that which in our wilful blind- ness we would none of us see, and which we thrust aside, not daring to look the dread possibility resolutely in the face. Dr. Truman became a most attentive visitor about this time. If he came for nothing else it would be to have a tilt at politics with John; but I could see all the time that he was watching Grace as closely as we were. One day he bluntly said, "Mrs. Fleming was very much worse, and no one could tell how soon it would end." John followed him out on the porch with a wild, incredu- lous look of agony on his face. "You are mistaken, doctor," I heard him say, " she is weak and nervous, and this infernal chatter of war com- pletely unmans her. She wants building up, she is so delicately constituted. We are all anxious now, you know. Tell me, would not these apprehensions affect her health? ' And he looked at the doctor with eager, questioning eyes. He shook his head. "I tell you, Graeme, you are wilfully blind. She is  -        1     I74         ATHOL, failing very rapidly, ' and then I heard no more, for Joht hastily caught up his hat and was gone an hour or more  tramping all over the side meadows in the snow, and when he came back it was to shut himself in the lit brary for the rest of the day, with a desperate, fixed. look in his face which told of a great unconquered struggle within. It was a season of anxiety and dread with us all, at home and abroad, for the clouds of distrust and appre- hension were rolling up thicker and heavier, and shadows darkened and deepened without and within, and rested with a foreboding cloud on everything. Added to this, the long, dark days of Lent set in. I had told Captain Alger that I accepted without hesitation the teachings of the one great Catholic and Apostolic Church, but Lent did seem a very doleful thing after all-particularly as Guy expected Harrie and me at every service, and the "Valley of Humiliation" was the last valley we were fitted to tread in those young days. And then, of course, there was no company, for we were quite a little Catholic community around Brookdell, strange to say; for in Massachusetts almost every one goes in the most primi- tive and unassuming manner "' to meeting." And you find by far the larger proportion of people are, as they- say, educated up to "Congregationalism," or go off to the other extreme of polished and elegant "Unitarianism." But we as a family had no sympathy with Puritan ortho- doxy or latter-day heterodoxy, and very properly kept Lent, and an atrociously hard time I had of it! John, I thought, secretly sympathized with me, although out- wardly he respected the season; but to sister it was the most perfect rest and peace she knew throughout the long Church's year. Day after day I found her with her prayer-book on the lounge by her side, its pages open at the appointed lesson, a smile of quiet content on her   ATHOL.         175 face, and in her eyes-oh! the wonderful beauty of those eyes-a look so strange, so entirely above and away from the world, that I sometimes felt like asking with sorrow- ing, repentant Hester Prynne, "thou look'st into heaven with those dim, far-seeing eyes of thine-then tell me what thou see'st?" One day I found her, after an attack of faintness which had completely prostrated her, lying back on her pillow with closed eyes, pallid and weak, but wearing the same old look of peaceful content on her face. John sat by her side reading to her. His face spoke of ill-concealed anx- iety and dread, but he was reading very slowly and calmly the beautiful psalm appointed for the day. I stopped by the window to listen to the dear music of his voice while I watched them both. Her long slender fingers, white and attenuated, lay upon his arm. .That poor hand had not the strength to wander lovingly in his dark locks as was her wont. She lay very passive and quiet, never open- ing her eyes. When he had finished there was a pause of some minutes. He stooped to kiss her in his tender way. '( You are better," he whispered;" tell me? Oh, Grace, you will soon be stronger?" "Yes," she said, "John, darling brother, stronger in- deed," and opening her large eyes, luminous and full of that strange outlooking light, but not at him-past and be- yond him-out, where the blue sky shone between the parted curtain, up to the everlasting heaven, blue, serene and gorgeous with sunlit cloud, she softly murmured, "stronger and better soon, in that land where there shall be no more parting, pain or death." He kissed her hastily and went out without a word. But standing by the window I saw him spring on Hector and dash away as if fleeing from some fearful thing. Then I turned away and took my guardian's vacant place by her side, arranging the pillows under her head.     176         ATHOL. o "Dear sister,"' I whispered, sometimes I almost wish I were in your place, you are so happy:" She looked up and smiled. "It is only going from great darkness to marvellous light-a happy journey home. There need be no fear in meeting my Father, ' Our Father,' my dear child," and she reached out her hands to me, kissing me several times. "You are so young and thoughtless, my little one. You will try and remember when I am gone all I have told you.' One need never be less joyous and gay-even the little simple pleasures of life will be greater by far-sanc- tified as it were. Oh, my love, you need be none the less a light-hearted, happy child," and she looked at me for answer. But I gave her none. My heart seemed bursting, and I escaped from her embrace and fled away. It was long before I came back to her again. When I did, the same heavenly peace lingered like a halo around her. To me she was already glorified, and the baptism of the waters of Death were not needed to perfect her as an angel. And so day after day went on, full of anxieties, full of vague fears, gathering as surely around our own happy fire- side as over the whole wide land. It was indeed a "Lent- en Fast," a beginning of that season which must end in despair and death, before the joyful Easter morning for which we longed and trusted should dawn upon our wait- ing nation. A strange, troublous time for us all. Even Harrie's exuberant spirits were checked, and we wandered about the house aimlessly and ruthlessly when we were not needed in sister's room. But John still clung to the belief that the mild days of spring would bring her back to our midst again in renewed health, and sometimes we almost felt he was right, for with the least return of sun- shine and warmth, she would rally with all the deceitful promise of her disease.   ATHOL.         1" And while we waited, spring and the new President   came in together. Wild, stormy March-a fit month to usher in the great new Confederacy-dawned upon us at length, and in the last mighty throes of expiring winter the great rebellion was born! The whole vast North lay in an apparently torpid state. A couchant lion sleeping off the lethargy of years, a wil- fully blind, lethargic sleep, at which half the civilized world I   stood and wondered. And in that sleep, different and discordant nationalities had steadily poured in upon the country, and fraud, ignorance and corruption stalked tri- umphantly hand in hand. But underlying it all, a great and intelligent patriotism suddenly flamed into life; and as of old the decree went forth, "Vox populi, vox dei," and conquered; and the man whom the nation delighted to honor stepped forth, the dark shadow of Fate and an uncertain future, clouding even the high position he had gained. We thought and talked of but two things-sister's health and the "impending crisis." Meantime, as John had hoped and confidently predicted, this dearly loved sister began to rally. It was a slow, almost imperceptible change, yet it became a manifest improvement, and we hailed it with eager delight. It was one of those unac- countable fluctuations of disease which sometimes deceive even the sick themselves, but the doctor gave us no more hope than he had given us before. John battled him as boldly on this point as on every other, but he protested she might live one month, or six even, but he doubted her enduring the heat of summer, even did her present im- provement continue. But despite his prophecies, she gained slowly but surely, and was soon able to walk from one room to the other, and join our little family circle again. It was a very happy party which assembled to do her honor the first time she entered our midst after so long an 8*     178         ATHOL. absence. Guy and Alice came up from the rectory, and even Dr. Truman dropped in and joined us in our cozy little tea. John had been at home all day, waiting upon sister in a dumb kind of happiness, and when we were all together, with a crackling wood fire on the open hearth, to make things " particularly alive "Harrie said,we really were a far happier family than had been gathered there for some time. Harrie was brimful of nonsense, and John was almost as bad. Sister herself lay back on her lounge, supported by pillows, the dancing fire and lamp light showing a weary but happy face. I gathered all three of the dogs on the rug by me, and out of the fulness of my heart, fed them prodigally with the crumbs-rathei large ones, I will admit--which fell from the rich man's table. "We will have old times, indeed!"Harrie cried. "John shall read to us. What shall it be, sister darling? It is your entertainment." And Mrs. Fleming chose that little witching thing of Tennyson's, "Maud," much to Harrie's disgust, who was more ultra AMERICAN than ever in those fierce ultra days, and she begged that nothing ENGLISH should be tolerated. But John read, and we-that is, I know Hlistened ad- miringly. I fancied, however, Dr. Truman looked a little distrait, and I knew he would have preferred infinitely the "Herald," for just then the papers were rife with interest, and the poor doctor was wild with excitement every time the mail came in. He fidgeted in a most uncomfortable manner over the reading, and heaved a sigh of exquisite relief when John closed the book, putting in a mark that we might take it up again and finish it. He was in such a state of entire unrest that Harrie laughingly declared some rampant newspaper lurked in theldepths of his coat pocket, and he was dying to ventilate it and have a fight with John; which ended in his drawing it forth and indi-.   ATHOL.         179 cating a -paragraph headed "Latest edition," while he sat drawn up in a hostile, waiting attitude, for John to dis- patch it, and then in turn himself be dispatched. In the mean time sister had disappeared with Alice, smiling good- night to her gathered family, and declaring she felt al- most as well as of old. John finished the paragraph very leisurely and tossed back the paper to the doctor without a comment. He waited a moment impatiently, then said, "Well, what do you think of it?" "You know what I think of it. Why do you ask? The whole thing is a base libel, a tissue of falsehoods from be- ginning to end." I     And away they started, both talking at once. "I intend to be a strong-minded woman," said Harrie, and she went over to John, balancing herself on the arm of his chair. "If this war ever comes to pass, you will see my name in print alongside the prominent women of the convention, so I must hear both sides of the question, you know." "You are about half gone over to the enemy, and the doctor's sentiments are poisonous, so I warn you now, if you turn rebel, you will be treated as a rebel;" but he put his arm around her waist with an action that belied his words, while the doctor, too deeply steeped in democracy to notice even "Prince Hal," hurled invectives at everything; be- ginning with his own native State, of which he was heart- ily ashamed, and ending with the cut of a "wide awake" cape. Guy never took any interest apparently in the state of politics, the state of the Church occupying nearly all his time and attention, so he came over to my side and read to me some exquisite little passages of Uhland's. But ex- quisite as they were, somehow the soft gutturals fell un. meaningly on my ear that night, And Guy read well, * '     180        ATHOL. too. Not as well as John, I thought, with a little swell of pride in my heart, nor talked as well either, I inwardly com- mented, for while- Guy was reading in his low, well-modu- lated voice, I heard under it all, John contending vigor- ously as ever with the doctor. "It is time," he said, " when any display of loyalty and national pride may turn the scale. I am determined for one to let nothing stand in the way of duty to my adopted land." "Do your duty,' interrupted the doctor viciously, "in any other way Greme but in turning incendiary, as all you English do, and help kindle the fire which must burn Constitution as well as country." "And I hate your boasted Constitution!" said John hotly. "How dare you declare before God that ' all men are free and equal' when one portion of your people lie bound in a galling servitude! The very framers of your vaunted Constitution blushed with shame when they formed it, and the fingers of the one great expounder of the true principles of Democracy-your own exalted Jef- ferson-expunged the word 'slave,' and with almost pre- science of the coming struggle, added ' held to service, or labor.' Don't talk to me of kindling a fire! This fire was kindled in hell my friend, and will never languish or die out until the great universal heart of humanity beats to the cry of liberty and equality throughout the land!" "And I,' retorted the doctor, "hate your hackneyed cant of liberty, fraternity and equality! It will be a fail- ure, this great experiment to prove all men free and equal! I wait the result with the bitterness of endurance. Not as you wait for it with your senseless twaddle of brotherly love and patriotism. I cannot even see God's blessed sunlight through these sullen clouds which darken our national sky with a pall as black as the night of death!"   ATHOL.         i8r i "And I can see the dawning of that day which shall rend the darkness as the vail of the Temple was rent!" said John excitedly. "I tell you this country, great and glorious as she is in all else save her one dark stain, must be redeemed-and redeemed as man was-by blood!" i   " "And blood you shall have, John Graeme! Seas of it " and the doctor buttoned his coat, wrathfully making ready to depart. "But I tell you now your repentance will come too late." "Oh! Guy," I whispered, forgetting Uhland and all else save this threatened desolation throughout the land, "tell me is all this talk true? I haven't heard a word you have uttered. Will every man have to go to the war -and will there really be any war at all? It is dreadful to hear the doctor talk," and I looked up at John, in his stalwart middle age, and then down at Guy in his delicate beauty and lately entered manhood, and involuntarily my fancy saw them both invested in soldier's cap and coat, leaving us-it might be, forever-and my heart cried out in unison with Dr. Truman, "God's blessed sunlight" was indeed, for the moment, hidden. Guy laid down his book and looked at me for a mo- ment, then he said solemnly: "If it indeed comes to a call 'to arms,' it seems to me, Athol, the voice of God will speak as plainly in the roll of the drum or the tramp of armed men, as ever it did in the thunders of Sinai." "Would you go??' I interrupted eagerly. "Would you leave Alice and all of us, and think God called you, Guy?" He stretched out his hand. A gentlemanlike, white hand, Guy had. "My mission is one of peace, Athol," he answered. "I want indeed to be a soldier-- true soldier of the cross. I want to hold only love, charity and forgiveness     182         A TrOL. in my heart, but-" and the white hand clenched sud- denly, "I could fight, I think, in a righteous cause, and my heart tells me if there is war, ours is the side to be on. Next to God, Athol-next to God, comes the dear old flag!" "I don't care for the flag," I said. "It is all one to me-the stars and stripes or the stars and bars. In- deed, for the matter of that, or the cross of St. George! 'Rule Britannia' never stirred my heart any more than the 'Star Spangled Banner'you are all singing now. Is it true, Guy, it was hissed in a Mobile theatre a few days ago?" "True indeed! Where it will all end God only knows." And he followed John and the doctor out on the porch leaving Harrie and me alone. She came over to my side and sat down with me and my pets. "What a pleasant evening it has been Athol, new sis- ter is back to her old self again. I can see a great deal of comfort before us now." "Yes; -but Harrie, all this dreadful talk of war fright- ens me so-don't it you?" She yawned wearily.- "I suppose so, but don't let us bother our head"-- then suddenly: ' I wonder if the Amal will be ordered away! What would you do then, Athol?" and she gave me a very penetrating look. "It's nothing to me," and I acted very unconcernedly. "Heigh ho 1. What is life? bubble, bubble, toil and trouble "--and Harrie sang it out rather sleepily and walked off to sister's room. By and by I took up U hland, as Guy had left it on the chair, and finished the poem he had begun, then dreamily commenced another. I remember it distinctly, and yet I could not keep my mind fixed upon it. I think,   ATHOL.         I83 fanciful as I certainly was, I had also a little touch of the i practical, and German- was always too much for me, so I literally dozed over the lines and fell into a long dream, in which my guardian, Guy and the captain, and a great dread of war, confusedly mingled. I was aroused by the "good-nights " of Guy and Alice to some one on the porch, and then I heard their retreat- ing steps on the gravel. The hall door closed and John came in. He did not see me. His brow was clouded and an indefinable something in his face struck me at once, and unpleasantly. He walked up to the table and sat down, leaning his head on his hand. "He will never give up worrying about sister," I thought, and I was about to speak, but hesitated, fearing to disturb him. He took a letter out of his pocket presently and-began to read. When e had finished he kept folding it over and over absently enough, but never once lifted his eyes or changed his position. I was- in rather an awkward- position, so as a divertise- ment I gave Uhland a good push, and away it went with a startling thump on the floor. He jumped up impatiently and came toward me. "It is late child. Why are you not gone to bed?" I got up without a word, cut to the heart by his cold, commanding tone, and went toward the door. He saw instantly I was hurt; for as I put my hand on the latch he called out in an entirely changed voice- " a What! no good-night?" "Good-night," very frostily, opening the door. TNothing more?" "You do not care for anything more," and I closed it. It was opened about as quickly as it was closed and John's face met mine. He put his hand under my chin and looked at me quizzically, with an "Aren't you ashamed of yourself, Daisy?" *     184         ATHOL. "No," I returned boldly. "It is you who ought to be ashamed, at your time of life, with your peevish, incom- prehensible, capricious freaks. Just like a child instead of a man!" He pulled me into the room again and held me off at arm's-length, with his back to the door. "At my time of life indeed, young Miss!" and I knew from his tone he was in good humor again. "Pray, do you regard me as ancient as Methusalah?" "Neither as old as Methusalah or yet patient as Job. You are simply the most unreasonable and capricious of men!" "You are vexed because I sent you to bed-now you  shall stay!" and he led me to sister's lounge, and his arm closed around me and drew me reluctantly to his side. I never spoke. "Has she nothing to say to me?"he whispered softly, turning my face to meet his. "Nothing but ' good-night.'" "You perverse little witch! I could make you talk if I pleased-see here-" and he pulled out the letteir he had  been reading, and laid one pageopen, so I could see the signature in a broad, scrawling hand- "Very hastily and truly your friend, D. GEOFFREY ALGER." "From the captain!"I said, in surprise. "I didn't know you were such friends. Where is he? What did he write about? What does the 'D' stand for?" And I was just woman enough to be incoherent. John laughed. "Good-night, Daisy," he said teasingly. "You can go now." "Indeed I will not! But I don't care for the letter," and I crumpled it up and threw it at him. I wonder s              . -!   ATHOL.         185 what,his name is-it can't stand for David and he such a Goliath." "D stands for a variety of things. Darling-Daisy, and such like dainty diminutives. In the captain's case it might stand very properly for Dunce "--then aftei a pause--"Might I smoke?" "If you like," rather sulkily, for I was dying to know what the captain had written about. "Would your majesty deign to fill my meerschaum?" I got up instantly and filled and handed it to him, even lighting a match for him, without a word. "Thanks, it will be all the pleasanter from your dainty little fingers." I took no notice of the unlooked-for com- pliment, and John puffed away silently for a little time, enveloping us both in a thick cloud of smoke. "When do you mean to ask me some more ques. tions?" he inquired presently. "Now," I said promptly. "May I go to bed?" "Then you don't care to know where Captain Alger is?" and he looked intently at me, with his head thrown back, smoking like a lazy Turk. "I haven't the least desire in the world!" "Wise little Daisy! Prudent, heart free little Daisy! And you would not read the letter, if I should give it you unasked? We will see. Here-take it." I pushed it aside, and I felt the color rising in my face. Suddenly he clasped me in his arms, kissing me on my forehead, lips and cheeks, so wildly and impulsively, I could not speak for amazement and confusion. "Yes-you are right. Go to bed," he said. ' I am forgetting myself. You did well to remind me I was neither a Methusalah or Job, but old enough to be your father! yes-go!" I rose up tremblingly to obey him, but again he drew me to his side. 9     *     I86         ATHOL. "Tell me only this," he said, "little Daisy. Tell me truly, and from your heart-if I were younger and a bet- ter man-pshaw-what am I saying? Would you grieve for me if I were truly to leave you? Suppose, as we were talking to night, there should be war." I came to myself suddenly, struck with horror at the dread possibility. "You would not go," I said, and I threw my arms desperately about his neck. "Oh! John, you would not leave us?" "How could I resist such pleading?" and his voice sunk involuntarily until it was the merest whisper, while his eyes looked down into mine with a burning, passion- ate glance, I had never seen there before. "I could not go if you bid me stay, that way!" "H-bid you stay!"I faltered. "You would not care for me!" "Not care for you, Daisy? Not care for you?-when the love I bear you is the one torment of my life!" I hid my face on his shoulder and whispered: Fear hath torment, but perfect love casteth out fear." "You have said rightly, little one-' Fear hath tor- ment,"' and for one momenthe held me closely to his heart-one moment in a wild, tumultuous ecstasy I nestled to his side-then he put me away from him with sudden, but reluctant resolution. "Do not look at me, Daisy," he said, "with those pure trustful eyes. They make me weak, and I forget myself in such weakness. Forgive me, Daisy-little Daisy-" and he lingered over my name caressingly. "Forgive me, and forget that I am anything but your guardian and old enough to be your father! There-go to rest and forget all the folly I have been guilty of to- night!" I got up without a word, or even a look at him and A   ATHOL.         I87 went up to my own room, in a strange, bewildered way, more than ever perplexed at his incomprehensible con- duct. But his kisses were yet burning on my cheeks and brow, and all night long they haunted me even in my dreams. CHAPTER XIV. THE next morning, strange to say, we met as if our conversation of the night before had never been. Find- ing John his old, composed, perverse self, I took his mood as mine and everything went on serenely as ever. But sometimes it occurred to me, that if it was a possible thing, he was the least shade more exacting and quick tempered than usual, and less capable of controlling him- self. And then it would pass away, and he would be his old tender, grave self-but not to me-not once did I catch the least caressing sound in his voice. When he spoke he even called me Athol, and I was not "Daisy" or "my child " to him all of that morning. He went off to Marshton Lea after luncheon-I watched him go-then as I had nothing to do and was wandering about the house aimlessly, feeling a restless anxiety which was per- fectly unaccountable, I went down into sister's room, and taking my crotcheting, tried to busy myself by her side. But I could not work. "You are having a headache to-day, my love?" asked Grace suddenly looking up in my flushed face. "You do not feel well at all, I am afraid." "Perfectly," I answered. "Have you been out for a walk to-day?"     I88         ATHOL. "No. Harrie is reading, and she will not leave her book, or deign to speak to me." "Then go out alone, my child. You really need exer- cise every day." She put her two hands under my face and drew my hot cheek up to hers. "Nothing has happened to annoy my little girl?" "Nothing, dear sister," and I kissed her cheek; "I am only too happy I fear. You are all spoiling me." She laughed and patted my hands in her own. a    "And you are getting well again," I said; " how could anything trouble us now?" "No, my love, do not say that. I shall never be- well again. John thinks so-poor boy!- but the doctor knows better." "You are no worse?"I said anxiously. "You did not exert yourself too much last, night?"   : "On the contrary, I feel better, and shall do the same again-for how long, I cannot tell-" she added softly as if speaking to herself. "I will not go and leave you," I said. "Yes, go. I am reading, and quite content and conm- fortable; beside- you need your daily exercise. Take Ponto, or Vic, and go down to the village for the mail. It will do you good, and you have ample time before din- ner." Reluctantly I put on hood and shawl, and calling Ponto we bounded out of the house, walking rapidly down the rough road to the village. It was a cold, disagreeable, stormy spring,'with sud- den wintry blasts that seemed to come direct from the frozen circle of Dante's Inferno, and I wrapped my shawl and- furs shiveringly about me, and hurried on, fast as I could walk. Ponto's delight knew no bounds, and he ran before me, barking vociferously at every step. Spring in the Berkshire hills is a myth and fable. There is no   ATHOL.         189 spring. It is cold, desolating winter, until suddenly by some odd and impalpable fluctuation we leap into sudden summer. The walking was horrible. However, it was exercise I wanted and on I trudged. When I entered the village I stamped the snow and mud from my heavy shoes, and smoothing my tangled hair, blown all over my face, I. walked soberly to the office and received the mail. NWith joy I noticed one letter for me, and recognized Mr. Crai ie's quaint, cramped chirography. I tore it open hastily, and read with a full heart all the welcome news of the dear old home, and Elsie's tender messages, and, the trifling detail of their monotonous life. How long ago it seemed since I had parted from them! How happy my life' had been with my new-found friends! Absorbed in my letter and my thoughts I 'passed the hotel without look- ing up until roused by some one clattering down the stoop, and hearing a sudden exclamation I looked up, and the laughing, handsome face of Geoffrey Alger met mine. He held out both hands eagerly, and the blue eyes earnestly asked a welcome. I gave him my hand, uttering only a few incoherent words of astonishment. "Are you glad at all to see me? only tell me that," lihe said appealingly. A thought of our last meeting came into my heart and I answered him hurriedly. "Glad, of course, but utterly astonished. I thought you were turned Indian or- Mormon, or had perpetrated some other barbarity, by this time! How came you here of all places in the world?" "By the pleasantest transition imaginable, Miss Athol." And he laughed gayly. "But if it had been past ' Scylla and Charybdis "I should have braved the sirens and come all the same! Tell me -again, are you glad to see me? Your words of welcome come very sweetly to my ear, after the monotonous solitude of camp life in the far West."     I go         ATHOL. He was walking by my side along the street, towering above me in his grey fustian shooting-jacket and leggins, with a soft cap of the same set jauntily over the tossed golden curls-his cheeks flushed and his eyes bright; and I caught myself looking up into their blue depths, and reading there what I had known before he left. Absence had not changed the Amal if it had me! "I am but just arrived," he said. "I have not even washed the stains of travel from my hlands, or changed my attire for one more civilized." I looked down at my muddy boots, thankful from my inmost heart he was not in his usual dress of miraculous dandyism, while he went on,  "You knew I was coming, did you not? I wrote to Mr. Graeme-"  i' Indeed, then, I did not know--I had no idea;;" and I thought inwardly-If I had read that letter last night, you would not have seen me in these boots, young man. But the captain was too unaffectedly joyous at reach ing civilization and friends again to think of dress or etiquette. "And where are you going now?" he inquired. "If home, I will walk home with you." ' Thanks, but I must see Alice," and the gate of the rectory opportunely presented itself. Just a shade of annoyance swept over his face. i "-And I am in no garb to pay my respects to Mrs. Fotheringham, so I will leave you here." He opened the gate for me, but lingered a moment longer.                     i "I must go to the Lea to-night, you know. Mrs. Marshton stands about in the light of a mother to me-- but to-morrow I may call? You will grant me this in- dulgence and favor?" "The indulgence will be yours-the pleasure ours." I could not resist saying.   ATHOL.          I91 He took my hand, and bowed over it, as a courtier might to a queen granting an audience! It was too ab- surd, and my' cheeks crimsoned at his tender and defer- ential manner. The wild March wind caught my curls and blew them all about. I thrust them back under my hood, and wrap- ped its folds more closely about my face. He turned back quoting some little lines with an un- mistakable meaning. "Tying her bonnet under her chin, She tied her waving ringlets in; But not alone in the silken snare, Did she tie her lovely, t9ssing hair," I knew what the other two lines were. "I hate poetry," I said abruptly "I am too matter- of-fact, and curls and March winds are nuisances." "As well as importunate friends. But I shall see you soon.") And he raised his cap, bowing gracefully as he turned away, and strode down the street. I ran up the little, trim, bordered walk-and opened the door without rapping. I looked in the library, in the cosy sitting-room, and'no Alice, so I went on through the, dining-room into the kitchen. "The mistress was out," I was told, " paying some charity visits." "I would wait," I said, and I thought I would at least give the cap- tain time to reach his hotel. So I sat down in Alice's little low chair, and rocked vigorously. A thorough Americanism I know, at which our sisters across the sea laugh abundantly, but it is a- comfort and eases our minds almost as much as our bodies. Then I fell into a profound train of thought. What was it looming up before me in the future? To what were ach day's steps insensibly leading me? Do what I would I could not     I92         ATHOL. forget the captain's earnest, delighted greeting, and John's cold avoidance of me the whole morning. The two different persons linked themselves together before me, and I could only wonder in utter bewilderment, how it would all end. I sat there lost in reverie until roused by the striking of the clock. I looked up. Only a half hour to dinner, and I in this dress, and I flew out of the house, dashing down the walk, and Ponto and I had the maddest possible race all the way home, even up the hill. The wind almost carried me along as I ran in breath- lessly, with cheeks aglow. I burst in upon Harrie, as she sat crouched in the window, finishing her book .by the fading light. "The Amal is come!"I said. "These eyes have be- held him-these hands clasped his?" She threw down her book delightedly. "We shall be alive now!" "I must dress," I said, bounding away. I had about two seconds to do it in, and as I brushed the disordered hair off my face I sung to myself- ---- what perilous danger you were in When she tied her bonnet under her chin." What a goosie I was, Geoffrey Alger! CHAPTER XV. TRUE to his promise, the next day the captain called. I dragged Harrie into the drawing-room and would not be alone with him an instant. The very next day Mr. Thorn came up with him, and directly they became our constant visitors as well as devoted slaves again. I did   ATHOL.         193 not ask the captain how long i he was going to stay. "There were stirring times ahead," he said, "and he was only waiting." A very pleasant waiting it seemed to him too, as well as to us, for Harrie and I had been a dull pair, with sister's sickness to worry over, and the stupid- est of all stupid winters to get through with. John, since that night on which he had talked so strangely to me, treated me with a cold avoidance, per- fectly exasperating. He was still a frequent visitor at the Lea. But when Dr. Truman came up, as he did occasion- ally, once in a way, of an evening for a game of chess, he always staid at home, and they went into deadly warfare over the game and politics simultaneously. The doctor was the most rabid old Democrat I ever saw! John, ultra in everything, swore by Phillips and Sumner, anathematized the 'late President, hurled Washington, Jefferson, and the Constitution at the doctor's defenceless head, who in turn hurled them back defiantly, and a pretty mixed up game of chess they generally had of it! Sister was able to walk around the house again, but it seemed to me she was fading as slowly and surely as anything could fade. But John would not believe or listen to it. All she needed, he still persisted, was the warm spring days to come. Dr. Truman still visited her, V but oftener I think canoe to meet Harrie, although he never presumed to ask directly for her. That vivacious young "Prince," as he called her, almost wore the poor man's life and patience out, Whenever she encountered him, and with her ridicule, her sarcasms and practical jokes, would have driven any sane man to the North Pole. Evidently how- ever the doctor preferred the Torrid Zone, so instead of driving him away, I think he only committed the indiscre- tion of liking her more and more. "I do believe," I said one day[ as we were coming home from the rectory where we went about twice a week 9     194         ATHOL. to muddle our brilliant brains with German, "I do believe Dr. Truman is just as much in love with you Harrie as ever a man can be!" She opened her eyes wide with a comical expression of despair.  "He had better not!" she said emphatically; "old fool, he had better stick to his pills and powders; faugh! I wouldn't have such an old drug shop about me! How can you be so absurd?" "He is not an old fool," I said indignantly; " he is a noble, true-hearted gentleman, and save and except his democratic principles- ' "Which you needn't bother your head about, Athol- inda Derwent; " with some asperity in her tone "mnuch you know about those things." "But I listen," I said, "and I heard John and the doc- tor talking until quite late last night. They said there would surely be war!" War!" said Harrie contemptuously, " fiddlesticks, rather!" "No, no, indeed! I heard Dr. Truman say, 'You will see I was right about the election of Mr. Lincoln. Just so surely as he enters office, so surely will the whole land be deluged in blood-and you see how it looks now.'" "And what did John say? ' "He said he wished to God the problem could be solved that way! He for one was ready to go boldly for- ward to liberty or death!" "Nonsense," she said with a toss of her head, "that is just like John, and he not even a naturalized citizen! I quite agree with Dr I ruman. What was the use of forc- ing a President upon the people, when everybody felt quite positive war followed in his train. I believe I shall separate in principle from, the Grame household and go over to the enemy."   ATHOL.         195 "Treason in the camp!" cried a voice behind us, and Captain Alger's fair frank face met mine. He came up to us with his friend, Mr, Thorn, dang- ling at his heels. It always made me think of a Skye terrier following a mastiff, when I saw those two young men together. Captain Alger immediately came over to my side, and together we faced the enemy. "He was a staunch Republican," he said: "he had voted for Mr. Lincoln, and if war was the result of his elec- tion, he should be the first to go." "Give us time to begin scraping lint," said Harrie gayly, " though I warn you, it will be such strong, demo- cratic fibre, it will never heal your wounds!" "Not the wounds you have inflicted on my heart," he retorted. "Don't talk of war and wounds," said Mr. Thorn, "it really makes me quite nervous." But Harrie winking at me, rattled on in such a bar- barous, bloodthirsty way that really if she had been a cannibal freshly imported from Fejee, she could not have shocked Mr. Thorn more. We found Mr. Grame and the doctor on the porch, lighting their cigars. "Fishing to day?" interrogated the doctor. Mr. Thorn answered: "We have toiled all day and caught nothing but--" "Two gudgeon," added Harrie. Captain Alger took off his cap and tossed back his damp, tawny curls. "I am tired of this inaction," he said. "By jove! I wouldn't be sorry if we did have war." "You wouldn't, eh?" said the doctor grimly. Just read this, young man. What do you think that looks like?" And he showed him a paragraph, with startling ac-     196         ATHOL. counts of the concentration of troops in and about Charleston, and premeditated attacks on the forts in the harbor. The captain's handsome face was a shade graver when he handed it back. "They are desperately in earnest,' he said, "and I'll tell you where we shall fail: when the storm bursts, they will be prepared and we will not. We have been too slow all along." "I tell you," said the doctor hotly, " it could all be stopped now, if we were not so blind and infatuated as to cast away compromise." And at it they went, all talking together, even to poor little Mr. Thorn, whose voice was quite drowned in the uproar, but who feebly persisted all the same "that war was dreadful! it was, 'pon honor, and it ought to be  stopped." When three or four gentlemen get together, one of two things, or the two combined, are inevitable-they will smoke and talk politics; and so out came the 'cigars, and the whole ground was gone over, from the framing of the Constitution down to the Nebraska bill, when Har- rie got worn out, although she took up the cudgels with the doctor against us all. At last she got up with her determined shrug. "Allon!" she said! '"Thackeray says when ladies are together, there are but two things discussed-dress and diseases. I think we may retort pretty safely-I, for one, am disgusted with politics." "Come, Athol, and dress." And ,she pulled me up stairs. "Dress yourself becomingly," she said. "Those two fellows will stay to tea, and old 'Pink and Senna' with them! I sha'n't attempt to captivate the Amal-he is down on me since he discovered my principles! so I shall try the   ATHOL.         1/ effect of' milkmaid's green' on Mr. Thorn. Do you think his great mind can stoop to suchtrifles?" she went on, as she shook out her green silk with such a sudden whisk that every particular hair on, my head asserted its in- dividuality. "Yes, green it shall be, and pink roses in my hair. Oh, for a rhorn! You shall see what a flirtation I shall have with him! I will make old Truman fit to walk to the stake with jealousy!" and she let down her back hair and pranced around in an ecstasy.     Gme"  "If you don't go to your own room, Harrie Grme," I said, ".I will give up dressing and not go down at all. can never do anything with you prowling around here and taking up 'all the room," and I put her, her dress, roses and absurdities, all out together and locked the door. That Captain Alger liked me I knew, and I was not quite seventeen, if you please, so if I pulled my hair down twice, and grew quite hot in trying to arrange it becom- ingly-it is no more than every other girl of seventeen has done before me. Finally, after demolishing two or three respectable toilets, we descended to the parlor, and found to our dismay they were still smoking, and going over the Irrepressible " hotter than ever. And so Harrie and I dawdled in the drawing-room, waiting for the summons to tea to break up the argument, and while I drummed on the piano she practiced "Les Grandes Dames " in the long mirrors, and took imaginary waltzes with imperceptible Mr. Thorns. Oh! the care- less, gay girls, that we were-and oh! the long, dreary shadows that have fallen between that time and this! As I look back now, it seems a happy, childish dream, and I live over again, in thought, the pleasures of our girlish days. It is not so long ago, and yet " we do not measure time by years" always.     I98         ATHOL. But I am digressing, and the tea bell, ringing, brings us back altogether again in our pleasant Brookdell parlor, where Harrie usually was mistress of the feast. But to- night sister presided. She was looking unusually well, and John was in high spirits. He drew her armn within his own, as she greeted our guests, with a proud sister- worship in his face. He was always doubly dear to me when he was so watchful of her comfort, and it was in- deed a goodly sight to see them together. When tea was over he wheeled up her easy chair, and  seating himself by her side, declared he was her obedient servant for the remainder of the evening. Dr. Truman was evidently de trop, as Harrie wickedly intended he bi should be, so, pleading patients, he ingloriously fled the field. Harrie therefore carried out her intention of add- ing the thorn to her roses. He had engaged her at the piano, and was turning over her music, and twisting him- self into a thousand contortions by her side while she rat-  tled on at her most voluble rate, mixing music, sentiment and nonsense, all together. Thus Captain Alger and I were left to our own de- vices, and after walking two or three times up and down the drawing-room, examining pictures, looking over en- gravings, and a variety of equally unprofitable amuse- ments, he some way mentioned flowers, and before I knew it we were in the conservatory, and he culling me one of the prettiest little bouquets imaginable. It was rather a dangerous position! The captain was very handsome, and his blue eyes, looking full in mine, told me what I  knew already myself-for, had I not a glass? and oh! vain little peacock! had I not on, my one only blue silk-my beauty? In my own eyes, if I had needed any- thing to complete my charms, that blue silk was in- deed the finishing stroke! I think the captain shared my ideas that night! At any rate he gave me the flowers,   199 ATIIOL. with a compliment which even at this late day I remem- ber, and then he asked permission to put a little trailing branch of jessamine in my curls. I let him, of course -and in two minutes more the gallant captai n was pour- ing out such an earnest, absolute, man dely confessi of his love, that I was quite stunned at the suddenness of the attack. You are a poor soldier," I said evasively, I thought you are soughtto make him think I    tried evasive answers.    e   th I viewed it as a jest. ," Indeed, Miss Athol," he said seriously, you must have known I wanted to speak long ago to you of this- from the first moment I saw you I made up my mind- you have known me nearly six months--can you not I stammered some incoherent words about my guard- ian, taking time, and all that, to which he readily assented, seizing instantly on the hope that mine was a consent only delayed. I did not give him any encoraget-  I ony told him he must waithand he promised to wait as long as ever I chose to make him--only he begged I might not in my hard-heartedness make it so very long. The more importunate he, the more exacting I grew. The moment girl feels hr power, how she uses it and when he would have taken my hand even, built up a little bar- ricade between us of an orange-tree, and vowed, "thus far he should come and no farther."  augurd sorts of good prophecies from the shadow of the orange blossoms, and then I wilfully retreated behind the cy- presso!     200         ATHOL. When at last, weary of the inanities of Mr. Thorn, she came with him in search of us, she saw at once the situa- tion, which the captain did not attempt to conceal. "We have been planning a fortification," he said apol- ogetically, "' and Miss Athol has gone into the entrench.. ments."' Mr. Thorn stroked his feeble mustache, looking quite mystified, ut Harrie grvely asked him, "Would he storm  the citadel?" I felt somewhat embarrassed and put up my hand- kerchief, which being taken as a flag of truce, Mr. Thorn assisted in pulling awa the flower pots and I came out, a little fearful of Harrie's eyes, which were rolled up at me in an alarming manner. For once in her life, however she came nobly to my aid, and when we went out in the hall to say good-night, took Mr. Thorn's arm, and walked away, leaving the captain and me alone. I knew he inwardly bestowed his choicest blessing on Harrie for the act, for he said as he threw a shawl around  my shoul- ders. " Do for me what your cousin has for Mr. Thorn, and walk with me to the gate." I silently put my arm in his, and we stepped out to- gether in the murky April night. Harrie would go no farther than the lake, and there she stopped He pulled me back, under the shadow of a dark ever- green, one instant. I will see yourguardian to-morrow," he said.  " Yo will give .me permission ? ' "No, not to-morrow-let it  go for a few'  days--a week,"  I pleaded, ,until I know my own mind." "You do not    know it  now ? oh my little darling--, and his hands pressed mine. He lifted me upto his own height just one'instant-he gave me two burning kisses  ! No one but John had kissed me like that before.   ATHOL.-        201 "Only call me Geoffrey once," he said, "say only once to me, my darling, as you would say if I were your lover, or husband-Geoffrey, good-night." His voice had a caressing gentleness I had never heard in it before. How could I refuse? I put my lips to his. I kissed him twice. "Geoffrey, good-night," I whis- pered. "Are you satisfied?"And calling out "good- night" to Mr. Thorn, I caught Harrie by the hand and ran all the way up to the house. She, fiend that she was, was laughing every step im- moderately. When we gained the porch, she laid both her hands on my shoulder and looked down into my hot, flushed face. "You humbug!" she said emphatically. "You have out-Heroded Herod to-night! I thought I could carry on a flirtation, but you eclipse me-you little monkey-you little nobody-and with my captain too! Aren't you ashamed of yourself?". "It is no flirtation at all," I said in a vexed tone. "He is in true, dead earnest." "And you? Tell me the truth." "I don't know. Oh, Hal! whatever shall I do?" "Don't tack evers on to your whats, in the first place, but come in and talk it over. But here comes John." She made a comical grimace. "The quality of mercy is not strained," she quoted, and flashed off to her own room, leaving me standing alone and quite guiltily in the hall. He held out his hand to me. "Whither away? Come in the library with me while I finish my cigar," and his manner was the same old pleas- ant manner again. I am tired," I said, "arid sleepy. I must go to bed." "Sleepy, with those bright eyes?" and he looked at me inquiringly. You and Harrie were talking anything 9'     202         ATHOL. but sleepily, a minute ago." And he led me into the library, where I knew all the time I would have to go, for there was no use in trying to disobey him. He threw the shawl which Geoffrey had wrapped around me, on the lounge and drew me down to his side. "Now talk," he said, " while I smoke." "I have notiing to say," half sulkily, except that I am sleepy." He was determined not to be displeased with me to- night. He drew me down to him. He kissed my cheek, still warm with Geoffrey's passionate kisses. Do you know, you look your very, very best, to-night, Daisy, child You are going to be very pretty, after all." The "after all" annoyed me. The captain thought me even more than that, now. "What have you dressed up your curls so fantastically for, with these wisps of jessamine?" And he began to pull them out. I put up my hands and took his away. "Captain Alger put them there, and I will not have them taken away," I said wilfully. "Captain Alger?" and helooked astonished. "Athol, child, I do not think it is well to let young men do such things-he has no right--" "Unless I give' it him," I put in resolutely. He looked down at me, surprised and severe. "And you, Athol, must first get the right from me!" "He called me "Athol "-not even "my child," or "Daisy." I felt defiant and neglected. I looked at him as he stood where he had risen, in his surprise, looking down at me, great, stalwart and strong, in his manly vigor, and I felt, noble and true as I knew Geoffrey Alger to be, my whole, undivided heart went out to John Graeme, as to none other. But then-he thought me only a child-- to be petted, corrected, cast off, whenever he pleased.   ATHOL,         203 He loved Miss Marshton--he would never think of me, as I thought of him. And my pride, young as I was, told me to put my faith and trust in the captain. All these thoughts went through my mind like light- ning, as I watched John's face in its stern, cold inquiry. "I acknowledge your right," I said slowly, " but not to treat me as a mere child. I am a woman. Captain Alger has done me the honor to ask me to be his wife." "And I defy him to take you!" he interrupted with sudden anger. "I will not have him steal into my house, without a word to me-without permission to even visit you, and snatch away all the life and brightness I had gathered around me for years to come." "' You are selfish, cruel and uninanly," I said, " but I have my mother's blood in my veins, and I can have my way as she did before me!" And my cheeks burned with an angry glow. He returned my gaze, steadily and angrily at first- then he changed just as suddenly. He held out his arms to me. "We must be sure about this," he said gravely, even tenderly. He folded his arms about me. He pressed me to his heart. He called me "Daisy " again and again, in his old, fond way. "I will not be unmanly and severe, my child. I spoke hastily-only tell me one thing. Do you love Captain Alger? truly and sincerely? You know how a woman ought to love. You have known him only six months. In that short time has he quite gained your heart?" His sudden change of tactics alarmed me. He will wheedle me out of this, I thought, and think no more of me than he ever has done, and I said with a perversity I did not feel-: "A woman ought to know her own mind in that time. I think mine is fully made up."     204         ATHOL.  "Then I will not stand in the way of such great hap- piness," he said coldly, and withdrawing his arm from me so suddenly, I almost stumbled and fell backward. I waited one minute. He never vouchsafed another word, but taking up his cigar, smoked vigorously. This was good-night I knew, s I slipped from the room with- out another woid and in ten minutes was in my own room; with the door between H+arrie and me securely bolted. That lively young damsel beat a reveile on my door- so suggestive, she called out, of camp life--but I would not let her in, and becoming disgusted she gradually sub- sided, and I was left to myself. I did not do like ladies in novels, ad espeially young ladies, sit up all night by a desolate hearth-stone, and waitch dying embers, until morning dawned; but I prudently retired to bed, and burying my headin the pil In the morning Harrie declared I had been to a wake. CHAPTER XVI. WE breakfasted late at the  Dell  always, but not too late for me. I dreaded meeting John, but I dared not absent myself. When the first bell rang  I ran down with- out stopping an instant to overcome that dread. John was sitting in his lounging chair, looking listlessly out of the bay window at nothing, but apparently it occupied his undivided attention. His newspaper was unfolded and in his hand, but he was not reading. He did not notice me at all, and Harrie coming in opportunely, the dread ren- contre assed off tolerably well;   But the breakfast was   ATHOL.         205 absolute torture. I did so fear to meet John's eye, and his face looked so cold and forbidding that I only trusted myself with one hurried glance. And then I fell to per- plexing myself with the though: " "Would the captain write? Would he call and see John, or worse still; would he call and see me? I blushed guiltily every time Harrie looked up. I almost died with the fear she would come out with one of her usual blunt questions, but she spared me that pang, for which I inwardly gave her all the grati- tude of my overcharged heart. Breakfast seemed inter- minable, but luckily everything has an end, and when fairly over, John took up his paper, opened his cigar-case, and without a word to either of us went off to the library. Harrie's face immediately expressed interrogation. I shook my head impatiently. "Don't ask me a single question," I said. "I feel savage as a fiend!" "And John, as you have perceived, is decked out in war paint and feathers, to say nothing of tomahawk and scalping-knife. It would be a great disenchantment if the Amal could only catch a glimpse of your face of woe." I did not say a word. "I always thought," she went on, "that ' Barkis' was the only sensible man I ever heard of, and when I receive an offer I hope it will be just as direct and simple. If it were I, I should just tell him I was 'willin" and let it go." "Oh! Harrie," I said impatiently. "I don't feel like nonsense this morning, and I am tired to death of--" "Me? I knew it!" and she gave me the look of a martyr.

The servant came in and noiselessly removed breakfast. Still I sat there watching the sun broaden upon the gravelled walk outsidethen creep in the window and transfigure everywleaf and plant  with its golden gossamer light. The birds hanging above my head basked in its glow and piped shrilly to one an!-  ther. Ah! how happy even the little birds could be--.    ATHOL.         207 and then I felt a sudden self-reproach. Why was I not happy? With so much to make life bright--what a mur- murer, what a fool I was-and I dashed the tears from my eyes ashamed to acknowledge even to myself that no love in this world could compensate for John's displeas- ure. My thoughts made me thoroughly miserable, al- though I could not shape them very clearly even to my- self. Down in the future, a very misty path lay before me, and I only knew with an unhappy void in my heart, that Geoffrey loved and John was angry with me; and the mists thickened and closed about that future, so I could not see the path. For me that morning the sun did not shine at all, and alas! it was veiled and darkened to more than my silly child-sight before it went down that night, for it was the month of April, I86I, and all throughout the land a great hush and solemnity had fallen on every Northern soul. Men said they were waiting,--biding God's time,-but the cry went up from many an! impa- tient, restless heart, "How long, oh! Lord, how long?" God spoke on the twelfth of that eventful month! Spoke as of old in the thunder cloud and smoke and swift lightning of another Sinai, and men's hearts quaked for fear at the sound of the awful voice. And while I, fool- ish child and dreamer, sat in the peaceful shadow of a dear and happy home, shaping for myself imaginary sor- rows, the dread reality of a more heavy and bitter sorrow than I had ever dreamed of was thrilling throughout the land. The telegraph had flashed it through the country, and it spread like wild-fire. Even while I sat there in the bay window brooding over my own unquiet thoughts, I saw Guy hurrying up the walk toward the house. He looked up, saw me, and before I could run away, was by my side. He did not stop to say "Good-morning." His face was white with emotion. He stooped and caught me by both hands, smothering a half groan.      208         ATHOL. "You have heard the news?" he said, looking in my tear-stained face. "This is. a dark day for us all ls a                           ark day for s "What has happened ?" I cried, thoroughly roused. " Sister--Alice-)) " You do not know ?" he interrupted.  " Oh! Ath'ol they have seized all the forts-they have carried everi- thing before them, and now Sumpter-our Gibraltar, 'Is we proudly called it-has surrendered I God help us, but the way looks dark !" I forgot all my own trifling sorrow and tears. I only thought with a thrill of dismay that the war was real begun ! The war, that we had first jested, then quarrel led over, but the war, whicar, in every light we viewed it, was so dreaded. Day by day we knew--for the country was full of excitement and rumor-that the Southern army were gathering and concentrating their forces. Then thik demand for Sumpter was made and rejected by its devo! ted little garrison of brave and loyal men--but yet s f render seemed utterly without the pale of possible  bilit. It came upon every heart with a shock; but with that shock, like theblast of the strong wind in the " Valley of Vision," the Nation leaped up suddenly into life, and flung off the stupor and lethargy of years. " Supter has fallen," was the rallying cry of the masses around the old flag that day, and party spirit and sectional intolerance were flung aside. I threw off Guy's hand, and, not waiting for another word, darted from the room. Without stopping to ask admittance, I burst into the library. John was walk- ing up and down, smoking. He turned around at this unwarrantable intrusion and faced me wrathfully. I did not give him time to vent his indignation. "Sumpter has fallen ! " I cried.  " Your vaunted An- derson has surrendered !."    "It is a lie!" he interrupted, hotly. "A cursed lie! They would die before they surrendered!" "Guy told me so only a moment ago. He is in the breakfast room now. It was telegraph news, he said." "It's a lie all the same," he persisted, but he caught up his hat and went out to meet Guy, and then I saw them a moment after, walking arm in arm rapidly toward the village. I ran off to tell sister the fearful news. Guy had been before me, and I found Harrie with her, eagerly reading aloud the paper which he had left behind. It was only a few words. The next papers would bring us fuller ac- counts, but these few words were enough to foreshadow a deep, dark tragedy, the like of which we had never seen before. Harrie burst into tears and wrung her hands, and then we sat down and talked as only women can in time of trouble. Very weak, foolish talk, I suppose, but we gained strength and courage from it, remaining firm in the conviction our side was invincible, and the telegram lacked confirmation. But before nightfall the news was in every one's mouth, and the New York papers settled our fears into conviction. "Sumpter" had indeed yielded! Our rock and tower of defence, our impregnable fortress, our Gibraltar, had fallen, and the " stars and bars " flaunt- ed triumphantly over the ruin. Later, we pored with tear-blurred eyes over the "' last edition," which told of the insulted and desecrated flag, the slow but sure de- struction of the hail-battered rampart, and then, when no longer able to contend with the bitter and overwhelming foe, the surrender. How severe a trial, only those who walked through that fiery ordeal unscathed knew! The night closed in dark and foreboding, fit ending to so dark a day in the history of this people. John had not spoken or looked at me since I told him the news in the library. He seemed not to see or hear anything, but sat     210 210         ATHOL. poring over the papers, eating nothing and noticing no one. When tea was over--and a wretched pretence of our usually pleasant Ineal it was--he went off to his own room again. Sister had not left hers since morning. She was agitated and excited beyond anything I had ever seen in her before. "This wretched business is killing us all," moaned Harrie, as she left me alone, cowering on the hearth, wi my old comforter Ponto looking solemnly up in my face  as if he too instinctively felt the shadow of this great trouble. "What would Geoffrey do?" I thought. "Would he leave me now (Why had'he not been near me the whole day? Why had not John spoken, and what was I to say if he did speak?"Just then Deborah brought in brary, Miss," she said, and I got up slowly without a; word. Ponto got up too and stalked along soleinly by my side. "Good old boy," I said, patting his broad headl as I walked along, feeling a sudden sense of protection in the brute's loyalty. The library door was ajar. I rapped then peeped in. John was lounging listlessly in an easy chair. He held his meerschaum in his hand, but it was )f the shadows which had lain so darkly on his brow all lay cleared away. He held out his hand to me, half ;riling, but did not rise. I came directly to'his side. "Who never said good-morning to me, or noticed me hrough the livelong day?" he queried. "Who was so cold andrepelling I was chilled into ab- olute; silence?" "Question for question, little embryo Yankee? How hall I answer you?" But though his tone was playful, his manner was pre- "upied, and he passed his hand over his forehead once -  i foeha once   ATHOL.         2" or twice as if he were in pain. He had gone back to his old kind way so suddenly that I forgot his. neglect. I dropped on the rug by his side and leaned my arm upon his chair. "Have you anything to say to me, John?"I whispered softly under my breath. ' "Yes, a great deal. Are you ready to hear it all?" I nodded, but did not look up, for I felt my heart beat- ing almost to suffocation. He took a crumpled letter from his pocket and handed it to me while a little ironical smile played around his mouth. Your preux chevalier loses no time," he said. "It came early this morning, before that devilish news of Sumpter nearly drove me mad." And he leaned back in his chair, lost in thought again. I threw back my head, and by the dancing-fire light and lamp-gleam, managed to decipher the broad, scraw- ling sentences, without changing my position or disturb- ing my pet's equanimity, for a shaggy head and two white paws were very comfortably located on my lap. Of course it was from Geoffrey, and was at once a frank, manly acknowledgment of his love, and an earnest hope of approbation and consent on my guardian's part. I handed it back to him silently. "And what does Daisy say?" I opened my mouth to answer, but the words died away unuttered. I looked at him mute and motionless, yet, he must have seen, with eager questioning eyes. He bent toward me laying one hand on my head and parting the curls from my face, repeating his question still more tenderly. "And what does my little Daisy say?" "I like him," I said, hanging my head and speaking very low. "I like him very much."     212         ATHOL. "He don't care for your liking him merely--he asks for your love." There was a pause of some moments. I hoped he would break the silence, but he left it all to me.  "You will give me no advice?"I asked at length, finding he would not speak and knowing I must. "You would not brook it last night-why should you now?" And he gave me a troubled glance. "I was wrong," I answered. "I spoke hastily-I am such a child. I have no counsellor, no friend, but you. Oh! tell me what to say." He turned suddenly toward me. "Child! child! How can I tell you what to say-how tell you what love is, when you are so far from me with  your arms around that insensate dog!"  A sudden, red light, flushed his cheek. His eyes  sparkled, and stretching out both arms he drew me to his heart. I felt just then I would give anything to escape, for he was reading me through and through with those quick eyes of his, but I could not stir, he held me so closely. "How can I bid you leave me?" he said hurriedly. "How put you from my heart? How teach you to give to another that which I claim as my right? How tell you that love a young girl should bring to the man she chooses above all others to guard her heart?" I trembled at the low passionate music of his voice but I dared not raise my eyes to his, or speak, and he went on. "Such love, Daisy-the love of wife to husband, is above all earthly comprehension. It must be the one and all absorbing passion of a lifetime! Asking nothing-- hoping nothing, fearing nothing-but giving all freely, fully, unconditionally. -Stronger than life--certain as   ATHOL.         213 death-unending as eternity. It has heights like Heaven- and, I know it child-depths like hell!" He spoke rapidly, incoherently, but every word fell on my heart as clear and distinctly as if he were weighing and uttering them in his calmest'moments. I did not un- derstand him at all. He had been so cold and forbidding to me all day, and now 'he was looking at me with eyes that plainly said, "I love you with just this love I have been telling you of!"- Every fibre of my being thrilled at the thought, but I stopped him resolutely. "You shall not say such things to me," and I drew myself half away from him. "Is that the way you love Miss Marshton?" There was no answer of words, but I could see the sudden paleness which flitted over his face, testifrying to the emotion he did not express. He half turned as if he would leave me; then hurriedly caught me in his arms. "You have such a frightfully audacious way of leap- ing at conclusions, child-you ought to know I do not love Miss Marshton thus." "Why pay her attentions that warrant such conclu- sions then?"I said boldly, "attentions that a man only offers to the woman he loves." "You are mistaken there, little Daisy. A man some- times entangles himself in just such meshes to avoid other and more dangerous ones," and there was a harsh bitterness in his tone. Then he suddenly looked straight in my eyes, saying hurriedly: Your heart is an open book to me, little one, a fair, open page, and mine a sealed, blotted and defaced one. Is it right to break the seals wilfully, and open to your pure gaze all the disfigurements I had hoped were hidden and sealed forever-? No. I will keep it sealed, little Daisy. It will be no harder for me to bear in the     214         ATHOL. future than now." And he said sadly and regretfully, 4 Why do I talk thus to you? What can your child heart know of such passion and loss!" And again he pressed me to him, as if he would hold me thus forever. All my fortitude seemed about to de- sert me when I felt his arms around me again, yet, now that I had the power I resolved to try him to the utmost. I would find out for myself this very night, if. John only loved and petted me like a toy, a plaything, to be cast aside when wearied of, and taken up again at his leisure or caprice. "If my heart is an open book to you, John," I said desperately, " read me only one page! I cannot do it myself to-night." "And I do not dare! Oh! Daisy, Daisy, why should I fall like such a shadow on your bright, young life? oh! my little Daisy, that I long to take to my heart and yet cannot!" He spoke wildly and passionately. He held me with such a strong clasp I could not escape. It was only a moment, but in that moment I felt that life was earnest, and love no longer a mystery. It had indeed heights like heaven! I had walked by his side, for an instant, upon \ those towering peaks. It was he who had lifted me up and then cast me down-no-I would not go down into those depths of despair! I would build up for myself a future as fair perhaps as he had given me glimpses of! All my pride flamed suddenly into my heart and nerved me to a calmness I did not feel, for I knew as each mo- ent fled away it widened the distance between us for- ever. And he kissed me again and again with a feverish eagerness, as if each kiss were a long farewell. "Little white hands," he said, crushing mine in his strong, manly clasp, and then pushing them away with a quick gesture of after-thought. "Little white hands, too   ATHOL.         215 dainty and pure for mine to clasp-how could I hope to hold them forever?" The passionate yearning in his voice startled me. c What do you mean?"I faltered. I do not under- stand you at all to-night." c We do not understand each other-that is all, little Daisy." And he put me from him with his old resolute action. "(You are not angry with me, Daisy, child?" His eyes had lost their burning light. His tone was sad. ' Not angry," I answered, " only you frighten, you be- wilder me." He did not answer, but turning away, walked rapidly up and down the room. Suddenly the door-bell rang, a loud peal that I knew as the captain's. He was come to get his answer in person.- An instant after the servant en- tered with a card for Mr. Graeme-not me. I looked at John's face as he read the name. "Show him in the drawing-room," he ordered, then tossed the card over to me. "What shall I say to him?" And he walked up and down, restlessly awaiting my reply. I made none. Finally, he paused before me in his walk. "Did you hear me?"Something of the old, inperi- ous ring in his voice again. "Yes, John." "Then answer." My heart was beating so violently I did not dare at- tempt speech. "Come here, Daisy," he said.  I went up to him and put m y arm within hiiswn, but not a word did I say.     2:I6         ATHOL. He looked down, fixing his eyes steadily on the car- pet, and not once raising them to mine. ",Daisy, you are young-a mere child. Is not the love of home "-he hesitated, then added-" and of us all enough? Will it not satisfy you for years to come? Will you leave us now for a stranger, who, unless he has your whole undivided heart, has no. right to a portion of it? Think it over well-not hastily-and act as your heart bids you." I did not trust myself with an instant's hesitation. "It is something to be sure of love, in this world," I said with a touch of bitterness in my voice. "Be more sure of your own heart, Daisy. Take time- think." "I do not ask time-I know myself." "And you will give this man," he asked incredulously, "all the rich love of your young fresh heart? you will bear for him always a love like that I told you of not an hour ago? you will make it the one all-absorbing passion of a lifetime?' I looked up nerving myself to a coolness beyond his. "I shall answer that question to one person," I said -" the one to whom I shall give the right to ask it." A defiant flash leaped up suddenly in the black eyes. "And you empower me to give Captain Alger this right?" "I do." "Tell me first-you shall tell me," and he spoke impetuously, "Do you love him at all?" "We are apt scholars," I said simply. "If we are thus taught we can give coldness for coldness, scorn for scorn, or duty for duty, even love for love." ' And so you are only acting out your woman's na- ture, and giving love for love?" And his voice threw back my" scorn for scorn." But 9   ATHOL.         217 the thick veins rose and throbbed on his forehead, the red, angry blood, dyed his cheeks. "I shall answer that question, as I told you before, to Captain Alger, when you have given him the right to ask it." He threw my arm from his with an imperious gesture. "You have no other questions to ask me?"I said quite collectedly. "None whatever. It only remains for me to assure this chivalrous chieftain the battle is won, and to offer my most profound congratulations." And he bowed himself out of the room with his most majestic air. I stood still for a few moments with the bewildered, perplexed feeling of one suddenly roused from sleep. "Do not be a fool, Athol Derwent," I advised mental- ly, and the advice oft-repeated served to calm me down into a very decorous frame of mind. I was sitting by Ponto, going over my list of adjectives after my usual fashion, when John returned. He stopped to listen for an instant before he spoke. "A brainless little fool after all," I know was his inward comment, but he merely said stiffly, the captain would not go until he had seen me, and I dashed past him, thankful only to escape his presence. As I stepped into the hall I stopped an instant to col- lect my thoughts. Geoffrey was in the room opposite waiting for me. I could hear his impatient tread, going up and down. "Was she never to come," he was thinking, and I imagined the handsome, impulsive "Amal," fretting and pacing, impatiently chafing at my delay. I could not keep a smile from my face as I laid my hand on the door knob, and turning it- softly went in. Sure enough Geoffrey was marching up and down the room, his heart thrown back, the tawny disordered hair IO     218         ATHOL. tossed off the impatient face. I was right in telling John I was sure of one person"s love! He heard my steps and turning came to where I stood, half shy, irresolute, and really not knowing what to do, and took me in his arms without a word. "You will be good to me?"I whispered. "Good to you?" and he lifted my face, looking down at me with laughing, love-lit eyes. "Indeed, I will not be good to you! I will be the most insatiate monster in my demands-I will have your whole undivided time thoughts and heart! I shall be a perfect Nero, I warn you. You have held me in torment these past six months, and revenge is sweet to the heart of the savage! Oh, my little darling! I must have all or nothing-and you will give it to me? You have come to tell me this?" I said "yes" almost in a whisper, hiding my face upon his arm. "And you are then mine," he murmured softly, "mine now and forever: will you ever lea n to love me as I love you?" "I give you all the love I have to spare," I said eva- sively. "And I ask for it all!" he said with a face of assumed discontent. "And there is one thing I shall stipulate. You are not to put me off with only the love you can spare. You are not to leave half your heart here at the Dell-I shall even be jealous of Ponto!" "He was my first love," I said. "Don't talk of first and second loves! it suggests frightful possibilities. Just now I am absorbed in my first, you will please remember; also, I shall always be jealous of these Brookfield people!"o ' They have been so good to me," I remonstrated. "Not'so good as I shall be, my little darling," and he looked down in my face with a smiling grimace and shrug    ATHOL.          2g1 of his shoulder. "My own little wife, you shall be very happy if I can make you so." His wzife-the words thrilled me strangely, falling sc softly and tenderly from Geoffrey's lips, and I thought with a quick sense of relief it was all over now;and I was conscious of a little triumphant feeling withal. I looked up 'at the tall, manly figure by my side, at the deep, earnest eyes searching mine, and I could not but admire this man, who was henceforth to be nearer to me thar all else. It did not seem at all like walking through the world, afflicted with perpetual nausea, as Harrie had sug. gested. On the contrary, it was a sure protection:-a strong arm to lean upon. Only I was not worthy-could never be worthy, so true and pure a love. But one thing I could do. I would put everything but Geoffrey out of my heart. After to-night I would think only of him. These thoughts ran rapidly through my mind, as I stood still in the middle of the robm, just as he had met me. He brushed back my curls, looking with bright, joyous face at me. "Of what is my little darling thinking?" he asked. "Of you, of course," and I dropped my eyes with a conscious blush. "I shall try and be worthy so much love," I said, soberly, " and will commence to-night by an act of kindness." Will you?" he interrupted. "What condescension! And you will begin by calling me Geoffrey? Don't tor- ture me with any more Captain Algers." "Geoffrey," I said, ' I shall do all you ask me in the future, but to-night I shall send you home." He gave me a dismayed look. You would never thrust me out of such a Paradise, after gaining it through the purgatorial sufferings of the last six months!" "Five, you mean."     220         ATHOL. "But they' were ages--eternities." I put up my hand and taking out his watch, with a new, strange feeling, that henceforth I was a privileged person, held it up to him. He shrugged his shoulders, and threw back his yellow locks, with a careless, happy laugh. "You will not have the heart to banish me, when I have not begun to tell half the love I bear you, and have borne since I first saw you." "It will bear repeating many times," I said, " if we are to take as truth the experience of the world. It is an old, old tale!" "And yet forever new. Oh! my darling, you will not tire of hearing it from me? Only tell me once that you love me wholly and entirely as I love you." I hung my head. "If you do not now, you will learn? I must have your whole heart, or nothing!" "I have given you all I had to give, Geoffrey," I said reproachfully, " even myself." "And God make me grateful all my life for the pre- cious gift. My only thought will be to make you happy, and myself worthy that gift. But tell me-" and his voice took a soft, caressing tone- "I shall be so happy if I can hear it from your lips. There is no one else-there has never been any one else whom you have loved, or thought you could love?" I looked up in his face and laughed. ' How old am I, and how much experience of the world and men in general have I, Geoffrey Alger? Don't ask me such absurd questions." He looked down at me as if he would fain repeat it, but he only carried my hand to his lips in a graceful way. The same hand that John had pushed awav as " too dainty and pure to touch," I thought with a little feeling of injustice. Geoffrey had no such compunctions, for he   ATHOL.          22, I drew me to him with a sudden sense of ownership, against which it was difficult to rebel, but he only said: "Beggars must not be choosers, you will tell me, if ] emulate Oliver Twist and ask for ' more.' " And he looked down at me with a love shining in his blue eyes, a love which I knew was all mine-all mine- but I could not, or would not, say the words he was long ing to hear. "And I must go," he said, lingering over his farewell "Parting is such sweet sorrow." He held me to him as if his new-found happiness were far too unreal to trust. "And I may come to-morrow, and to-morrow, and to morrow--I may have you all to myself in the future?" "And what of your country, Geoffrey?"I said "Has the news of to-day no power to damp your presens joy?" A shadow crossed the bright face. "I have forgotten everything but you, my little love You must not blame me if I think of nothing else at present. This morning I was wild and eager for the con flict to begin. To-night, selfish mortal that I am, I car only pray that nothing may separate me from you." "Will there be war?"I said, half fearfully going back to my old dread. "I have nothing to do with war to-night-my heart is too full of peace." "You are a silly boy;" but I put up my lips and kissed him good-night, as he bade me. Still he lingered. "You must go," I said imperatively, "it is getting late." He gave me a smiling grimace. "What a little tyrant of a wife I shall have by and by.' "Don't talk of such things." '    (     222         ATHOL. And I turned away to hide the sudden flush which crimsoned my cheeks. "Then, as I am in the future to personate your abject slave, may I light my cigar to cheer me home?" "If you will promise me to go I will light it myself." "To hear is to obey."'  "I ran to the taper-stand, lighted and handed it to him. "Will you do all these things for me when you are Mrs. Alger, and shall you let me smoke as much as ever I please?" "I shall never dare assume the title, if .you obey me no better." "Then I am off like a flash," and he disappeared. I waited, listening until I heard his footsteps in the stillness of the quiet, spring night echoing along the gravelled walk. Then I dashed outthe light, and flew up to my own room. I had the wisdom not to ask myself any useless questions that night. I put all the past away from me. It should be all future now. A future which, young dreamer that I was, I dared shape for myself of empty air. And the bow of promise glittered faintly in the airy mists of that future, which Geoffrey had told me should know no cloud. CHAPTER XVII. WHEN I met John the next morning he was entirely unconscious of the embarrassment of the situation, and acted as perfectly indifferent as heart could- desire, thus affording me every excuse to regain my composure. Strange to say, however, composure did not come for the P   wok       , F ,               -   ATHOL.          223 simple calling, and, to add to my confusion, Geoffrey, true to his threatenings of the night before, came up to the house as soon as it was possible to call after breakfast. I felt a little confused at his entrance, but he was so tri- umphantly happy that it was really more laughable than confusing after all. As Harrie said, he radiated from every pore and was so light-hearted and joyous we fell into his mood at once and were a very merry party for, utterly forgetful of the old saying, u three was a crowd," I persistently kept Harrie in the room. He did not seem to care in the least for her presence, that is, as a restraint, for he instantly took possession of me, apparently having forgotten there was any one else in the world. There- fore, it was a great relief to me when the doctor came in to pay sister his usual visit and carried him off in his buggy to the town to get some news. For it was really all the poor doctor could do to watch the papers and fly his democratic banner, and he was so absorbed and eager in the daily developments of the rebellion that he failed to take a sense of my new position with regard to the cap- tain. He had known Geoffrey since he was a youngster in frocks, and he could not seem to realize he was a man. "Geoffrey, lad," he said, " these girls will be glad to excuse you, and you are all impatience, I can see, for news. Jump into my gig and we will ride over the hills to the town, and see what people think down there." It was in vain for Geoffrey to protest he. was quite cool on the subject, and could afford to wait. The doc- tor would listen to no refusal, and c rried him off with a somewhat wry face and sundry protestations; also, by the look he gave me at parting I knew war was quite as far from his heart as it was the night before. At any rate, I thought, he will undeceive the doctor, and I la lghed in- wardly when I remembered his vexed grimace as they drove away.   .     224         ATHOL. The day passed by and Geoffrey didnot return. The doctor had succeeded in keeping him captive. As for John, he was at the village all the morning, and came in at dinner-time with a dark face. He had very little to say to any of us, and when dinner was over, mounted Hector, and went off for the New York mail. Sister was asleep, and Harrie and I took our crocheting and sat down to- gether in the window of my room overlooking the lawn. "I am dying to put you in the witness box," she had said; " and hear your true and candid testimony," and I had answered, "go on-ask all the questions you like," and then we two plunged into the merits of the case as young girls do, "in medias res," and I quite forgot my ill- humor, discussing Geoffrey as gravely as if our engage- ment had been a thing of long standing, and not like "Jonah's gourd," the growth of a night. Harrie, evidently in spite of her heretofore feigned jealousies, seemed very jubilant oyer the unexpected turn affairs had taken, and somehow, for the first time in the course of our good-fellowship, we grew very confidential and sympathizing. I had so much to tell her, once I really set about a confession, and it was such a new, be-  wildering story for me to recount, that I went on, entang- ling myself more and more in my incoherent recital, and never being quite clear any of the time that I was deceiv- ing myself along with Harrie. Indeed, I took no time or opportunity to understand myself clearly. I had said the night before " it should be all future with me now," and I kept my word. And Geoffrey had gathered me up to himself as if nobody else on earth had the slightest right to me, which was all very pleasant and amazing to a girl of not quite seventeen; and as my heart did not in the least resent such ownership, I was fain to call-it love. But when I had told Harrie the little fable and received her hearty congratulations, I felt a sudden remorse, as if   ATHOL.       2. 225 I had not perhaps given to Geoffrey quite all he deserved. Deep down in my heart, hidden and concealed, lay a somethivng I dared not bring to light. I would not look at it, or acknowledge its presence even to myself, but I felt all the same, this sudden pang of remorse akin to shame, and all my woman's nature rose up and asserted itself in respect for this man who had given me for my base coin the true ring of the solid metal. I hardly knew indeed how base my coin really was, for I had not stopped to test its worth. I had given, as I told him, " even myself," and I did not realize it was not all I had to give. "It was the blue silk," said Hal laughingly. "That fatal blue silk that put the finishing stroke to my despair and your happiness at one blow. Wear it to-night, do Athol, and I'll put on my green-the milkmaid's green, you will remember." "At any rate your heart is safe," I had said, and then she danced off to dress, putting in her head again when I was very nearly ready, to say Geoffrey, the doctor and Mr. Thorn, were all coming up the avenue. "You had better go down," she advised, as I was fin- ishing my last curl with a very decided color in my face at the thought of meeting the captain before the others. "Not without you, Hal. I could never do it." So we put the finishing touches to our toilets and went down after a little into the drawing-room together. They were not there. So on we went to the library. Not there either. The room was quite deserted. "They are sister's visitors after all," said Harrie, and we opened the door of John's " museum," as we called it, going in with a little agitated flutter, which was but natu- ral. In the window, eagerly looking over the paper and talking, was the doctor and Mr. Thorn. Sister lay on her lounge and Geoffrey was by her side. The soft twilight showed me her face. It looked interested and eager. She IO*     226         ATHOL. held out her hand to me, but did not say a word, for Geof- frey was speaking very low and rapidly when I came in. He rose when he saw me and placed a chair by her side, but I dropped on a footstool at her feet as was my habit, while Harrie, after a hurried greeting, joined the doctor and Mr. Thorn in the window. I looked up at Geoffrey. Our eyes met for a moment and a tremulous something I had never seen there before made my heart beat tumultuously, but he went on, speaking low, so only we could hear, though for that matter they would hardly have heard an army storming the gates, for all three were in an instant talking excitedly, as was inevitable over the one only theme the papers gave us. "Whether she be mine now, or whether I serve for her as many years as did Jacob, time will not change me, ex- cept to make more sacred and dear the bond between us now. I shall never be thoroughly happy until I call her mine in truth." "Life will be endurable you will find with even a neg- ative sort of happiness like this," and the shadow of a smile flitted over sister's face. "But we do not want a negative happiness. We de- mand instead a positive joy, and failing of it we take a positive woe!" And he tried to put the woe he was talking about in his bright, handsome face, and failed so signally we were both forced to laugh. "Do not think me unthankful," he said quickly, before our laugh had subsided; "but we are never really con- tent, you know, and directly we receive one blessing crave another. But you have given her to me fully and freely." "To no one more fully and unconditionally. There are very few to whom I would bequeath my little legacy." And she looked at my blushing face with an earnest, wistful look in her eyes.,   ATHOL.         227 With a sudden impulse he drew me to his side, then bent down and touched her hand with his lips. "You have read my heart so well to-night I shall not offend you by repeated thanks, but I have something more to say. I am ordered to Washington; indeed," he went on with a deepening color, "my duty would call me there now, if orders did not. I shall try to get the command of a regiment, and then-" "I do not understand you," said Grace, half rising and looking anxiously in his face. "Will there be need of an army after all?" "Undoubtedly. People expect a call for troops hourly. "After all," he said half sadly, "I may never come back to claim the gift which you this night, my dear madam, have made me, and I am weak enough to long to call her mine before I leave her." And his voice took a beseeching tone. She shook her head decidedly. "You are both too young. You are mere children." ' I am a tall child," he said with an unsteady laugh and a flush on his face, " and I shall love her no better if I wait ten years." "But you will have gained more than love by wait- ing. Beside, the present moment is not one to rashly form ties. You mean to serve your country faithfully, and will I do not doubt, you but are young and need ex- perience." "Ah!" he said with a long breath, "if she were only mine now." "She is yours," said Grace gently. "I have given her to you to-night, and she gave herself when you sought her. You must not ask any more now." And so my embryo Bayard was forced to rest upon this hard-earned victory for the present. "John is coming," I said, glad to end this unlooked-     228         ATHOL. for conversation which was anything but a pleasant one to me. "Now for news." Guy was with himi. They were talking eagerly all the way up the gravelled walk, and it was easy to perceive something of importance had happened. When they saw the doctor and Mr. Thorn they disdained the door, but opening the long window came in that way. "We are famishing for news," cried Harrie. But John, never noticing her, went on to sister's couch, and bending over her, asked her tenderly how she was. "I cannot tell," she answered tremulously. "I feel so frightened and nervous every time the mail comes in. Is there anything new in the papers to-night? Anything that will interest me?" "I am afraid not," he said, stealing a glance at her anxious face. There is nothing you will like to hear, darling." "More bad news?" "No," and the black eyes flashed suddenly, "good news for us all. We have a strong hand at the helm now. The new President calls for seventy-five thousand men'!" "Seventy-five thousand men!" said the doctor in- credulously,.as he sprang up and came toward us. "He will not get a corporal's guard!" "He will get a million of brave loyal hearts and plenty of trusty steel if he do but ask for it," retorted John hur- riedly. "You will see this man will get all and more than. he asks for. He has the heart and confidence of the people already." "God grant he may," added Geoffrey solemnly. "Tush, boy!" said the doctor contemptuously. "You don't know what you are saying. This thing could all be stopped now." "Not after they have taken Sumpter from us," I interrupted hotly. "You forget that, doctor!"   ATHOL.         229 I forgot nothing, you little bloodthirsty monkey," he said half angrily, turning upon me. "Not even the fact that you are talking about what you do not in the least understand. Pray, child, don't imitate these intoler- able Massachusetts women, and have an opinion of things which do not concern your sex in the least. Read St. Paul and keep quiet." I never could endure St. Paul, and I shall have as many opinions as I choose. One very decided one is, I hope I may grow to be just exactly like one of 'these Massa- chusetts women,' " andI mimicked his contemptuous tone. He turned his back upon me and said something about a " forward chit." Whereat I laughed, and he testily called me "Miss Impertinence," and asked John for the paper. Grace had lain back very quietly while we were talk- ing, but her hands were clasped and she was agitated be- yond the power to conceal it. - I had so hoped something might have happened to prevent this," she said regretfully. "And it is as good as declaring war, is it not?" "Indeed it is," and the doctor's brow clouded. "They will never stand this forcing an army upon them. There must be war." "War to the knife!" said John with grim satisfaction. "Here, Harrie, take the paper and read." And Harrie read aloud to us all the simple, straight- forward, earnest call of this new man, who was to be our temporary king for the coming four years. The man whom already the "nation delighted to honor." There was a pause for a few moments when Harrie had finished the reading. "I hope it will not be the old song verified," she laughed. "The king of France, with forty thousand men, Marched up the hill and then marched down again."     230         A'rHOL. "If there is any 'marching down again,' Miss Harrie," said Geoffrey, "it will not be on our side, I hope." "And my only fear is," spoke up John, "they will   i back out of it all when they find how the North stands to a man. I never had any faith in these fire-eating South- rons." "Remember, they are prepared," said Guy, " better prepared, alas! than we. They have not been garnering up their strength for years for nothing, you will find. I should not be surprised even if Lee marched upon Wash- ington to-night. It is defenceless comparatively." "By heaven!" said the doctor excitedly, " it would be glorious news! Only the ' Scotch cap and cloak' might be of use again, and in flying foreign colors Mr. Lincoln might escape." We all looked with indignation, and even Harrie spoke up in a sort of remonstrance. "You know I'm on your side all along, doctor, but don't please bring that choice bit of gossip against one poor, honest-hearted rail-splitter. I don't want to believe such a thing any way; for much as we opposed his elec- tion, he has fairly won his place, and for decency's sake let us cover up any defects of character we may perceive. Let us cry 'Vive le Roi' with the loudest, as long as it lasts." "Never!" said the doctor decidedly. "Never will I countenance by word, look or act, the party or their pres- ident; and this infamous thrusting of war upon a country which was peaceful and prosperous until now, is their crowning act of madness and folly." "I cannot see what good we do our country, or our- selves for that matter," remonstrated Geoffrey, laying down the paper he had been glancing over, " by talking in this strain. We have seen what quiet forbearance has worked for us in thelast six months. There is nothing * '  !   'i   ATHOL,         231 fdi7Mr. Lincoln to do but accept the situation the South has forced on him. They want war. They have wanted it for years. Beside, doctor, they fired the first gun you will remember." "No, indeed, boy! Massachusetts fired the first gun years and years ago. Every man, woman and child, as soon as they could speak, have taken up the warfare." "Small ammunition though," I interrupted, "if you please, doctor. You say yourself the women are not worth minding." "But they are exasperating all the same," with a sav- age scowl at me. "I have seen one little fly worry my horse on a hot summer day more than my vigorous ap- plication of the whip ever could. And yet there is noth- ing more insignificant and mean in life, you will grant me, than one of those flies." "As one of them, thank you," determined as usual to have my say. "Don't jest," said Mr. Thorn, speaking for the first time, " it all looks terribly earnest to me, and I haven't the courage or faith to look ahead." "And the nation must have both to save itself," and Guy's voice was solemn. "We must have faith in God and a great cause, if we hope to see a day in which wrongs shall be righted, and liberty and justice prevail." "I cannot wait for it," said Geoffrey. "Flesh and blood cannot sit down in passive endurance and waiting as heretofore. I am off to-morrow, first train. They shall give me something to do at once." But his voice was unsteady, and his color came and went like a girl's. His heart was full of fire and patriotism, but I knew he was thinking of leaving me, and I sat perfectly still, watching him with a strange, pleased satisfaction that somebody loved me and henceforward would think of me and my happiness before all else in the world. It brought     232         ATHOL. a burning flush of consciousness to my cheeks as I sat there by sister's side. She lay perfectly still, listening to them all, and look- ing steadfastly at John, never noticed aught else but his face. He caught her anxious glance and came over to 1 her at once. I rose up at once and gave him my place, which he took without a word or look at me. The others were still excitedly going over the old ground of debate, and did not heed Geoffrey impulsively taking my hand and leading me to a seat apart from them. He placed himself before me, looking down upon me with triumph-  ant possession in his eyes. (    , "I have you all to myself n w," he began, " as I have been dying to have you for the last hour. I have so many things to say, and where shall I begin?" "Tell me first," I said smiling, " if you are really so glad to be ordered away." "Yes. Paradoxical as it may seem, I long to do something for the country I love and the flag I have sworn to follow. I long with an intensity of eagerness, impossible to describe, to see this land redeemed from every foul stain of sin and wrong, taking her place among the powerful nations of the earth-foremost  among them, too, my heart tells me if we conquer in this strife! If we are only strong and great enough to put down treason and rebellion here in our midst, we can defy the world safely hereafter. And yet, my little, new- found treasure, from whom it is so hard to part for even a few brief days, I find the dream of love too sweet to rudely break the spell." "That's all understood, sir," I answered laughingly; "please tell me something not so entirely personal." "Shall I talk of myself instead of you, then?" and I thought he was a little disappointed that his love-making Al I should receive such a check. "Shall I tell you I go to   ATHOL.         233 Washington to-morrow, not knowing where I may be or- dered; and then again I inevitably recur to the former position, and must ask, What will you do in my absence?" "Pray you may be safe for one thing," I said softly, and with a sudden impulse of liking to flatter and gratify him. "And come back to you soon?" he queried, laying his hand for an instant on mine. And then we went off into a long conversation about the future, in which, notwithstanding my prohibition, I figured largely; and although I have a most distinct recol- lection of many things we said, I scarcely think it worth while to jot it down here, such conversations being some- what of a bore if translated verbatim. It was quite dark, and lamps were lighted and tea served before the others left, and Geoffrey and I were obliged to come from out the window recess and join them at that most informal household rite, and after it was ended all rose to go; even Geoffrey, who pleaded his early de- parture, but yet lingered behind loth to say farewell. He would write me, he said, or if fortunate in obtaining all he sought, could hope to be with me in a few days. And so while:my Sir Galahad had taken up his lance and gone out in this quest of the new Sangreal, I walked about the house in a kind of dream after that night. A quiet kind of dream which no one attempted to break, for all took it quite as a matter of course. The captain had paid me such exclusive attention for so long a time that no one seemed startled at the inevitable result. The Marshtons rode over the next day to present formally their congrat- ulations. Georgianna evidently thought her cousin a little insane, but she politely did her best to withold the knowl- edge from me. Bella gave me an uproariously cordial embrace, and declared she was dying for a wedding, and "we wouldn't put it off so very long, would we?" with     234         ATHOL. a very comical face, which sent the blood rushing into my cheeks, for marriage was the last thing I had thought of, the captain as yet having only spoken of love. "Oh!"I answered hurriedly, "I am young and I suppose-indeed-I hope it will be sometime-I must wait-besides Geoffrey has never said when-" And I began to get things just a little incoherent. Harrie and Bella laughed merrily at my confusion, but Lizzie spoke up very quickly in her old-fashioned, sedate way. "You are right, Athol. You are young, and I heard mamma herself tell Geof he had better make it a long en- gagement." I looked up inquiringly. "She said you were both young, and she hoped would take time to know your own minds, or something of that kind. I do not exactly remember, but you know," and she dropped her voice, " marriage is a sacrament and- should be entered into solemnly, as we ratify our Baptis- mal vows." But I cut her explanation short, fearing she would give me the whole seven, and stammered out something about as incoherent as my thoughts on the subject. And so it was all completed very quietly, and but for the bril- liant which Geoffrey had put upon my finger at parting, things went on very nearly as they did before. John was the only one not quite unchanged, and why he, above all others, should conduct in such an unseemly manner re- mained an unexplained mystery. Angry I knew he was that night I accepted Geoffrey, and angry he chose to re- main. If I had been the smallest atom of- dust instead of the respectable sized portion of humanity I thought I was, he could not more perfectly have overlooked me. He entrenched himself in his library, and the clouds of cigar smoke hung there like a pall while he pored intently   ATHOL.          235 over the papers, as much engrossed in passing events as the doctor. For my part I paid very little attention to his likes or dislikes. Once having made up my mind and taken the all-important step, I judiciously concluded there was nothing more for me to do. "Yes, Athol Derwent," I would say, taking myself into my own confidence, after my usual fashion--" you have youth, happiness and love before you-a fair future indeed-are you not satisfied?" And although I asked myself this question every hour in the day, some way or other I never really answered it. CHAPTER XVIII. ONLY three days did Geoffrey stay away from me; but I must confess even in that short time I missed him sorely. I think any girl of my age would have been simply an idiot not to miss such frank, manly homage. So as I was unaffectedly glad at his return, I did not make the least attempt to conceal it. He, too, was radiant. He had received his commission as colonel, and was to raise a regiment at once in his own town. He would be with me for some time; for the men were not only to be recruited, but drilled and prepared as well, and he put our parting farther than ever from his thoughts, deter- mining to make all he could of the present. Meanwhile, events followed each other thick and fast. That month of April, I86i, is a month long to be remem- bered in the history of this people. First, the murder of our brave boys in the streets of Baltimore. That was a blow, quick and sharp. And suddenly, as if every man felt the time was short, the day far spent and the night at hand, " the flash of a mad enthusiasm leaped strong and     236         ATHOL. sure in every Northern heart. There was no thought of previous political difference, no mere party shout, as men rallied around the flag. Only the old battle-cry, "free- dom," was heard throughout the length 'and breadth of the land. John went down to the city, in the first flush of his eagerness to know the worst, and see for himself this wild uprising of the people, the news of which came to our ears up among the tranquil hills, where we, at least, as women, could form no conception of the sudden furore in the great city only a day's journey from us. But we read of the triumphant and prompt succor of the Seventh, and shed tears of joy as We lingered over the details of that jubilant march down Broadway. But we never re- alized all the mad riot of joy and patriotism which crowned that day, and made their march one long ova- tion, the like of which was never seen before, and it gave a lustre and a name to the old'Seventh which, sturdy and strong, they hardly needed before. Then followed in quick succession the seizure of forts and arsenals, and lastly, the month closed with the meeting in state, at Mont- gomery, Alabama, the full-fledged and independent Con- gress of this great new Confederacy! And all this time the nation was slowly gathering up its strength. There was nothing thought of or heard but the keep note of preparation. The doctor looked in upon us one day to tell of the seizure and occupation of Arlington Heights by the bold insurgents. "So near!" said John testily. "The White House will be taken and occupied as an arsenal by them next! By heaven! What is our Government dawdling and driv- elling over? What are our men doing?" "Mine are drilling," said Geoffrey promptly and look- ing up. (Mars looked rather inactive at this present i   ATHOL.          237 moment, to tell the truth, lying indolently in the window seat, tangling my worsteds and tapestry silk, and play- ing the very mischief with my work-basket.) "I told you where we should fail-if we do fail for a season. We have only the raw material as yet to work with-they the trained and thoroughly disciplined. It will be up-hill work for a time you may be sure, but our volunteer forces will be our glory and strength in the end." And up-hill work it certainly proved to be, for closely following this disaster came the death of the brave, im- petuous young Ellsworth, filling the nation afresh with angry, revengeful life. It was torch to the waiting tow- the match to the full magazine. The South had taught the North a bitter lesson in one short month. Might not the North teach them a still graver lesson before they were done with them?"Would to God they could," was the earnest prayer of every heart. And men did not merely pray, they worked as well. Everywhere recruit- ing offices were opened, soldiers were drilling, ships build- ing, cannon being cast, and even we women took to send- ing out hospital stores, scraping lint and sewing. The delicate white hands of the finest lady in the land took up the coarse knitting, or heavy army shirts, and all were united in the one great cause. Even the doctor grew feeble in his faith, and almost ceased to war upon the other party or their opinions. It was too late to compromise now," he declared. "We had gone so far that we could not with honor go back." Ellsworth's death settled his conviction. "The ball is opened," he irreverently declared, " and a gay dance of death you will all have of it!" We were gathered together in sister's room when this conversation opened. John, Guy and Mr. Thorn, with Geoffrey, had- joined us there when the doctor came in,      238         ATHOL. his troubled face foretelling his news. "O bird of ill omen!" was Harrie's greeting, "what fresh disaster do you bring us?" He opened his budget without delay. "It is not enough," he said angrily, "that our boys are murdered at their posts-that forts, arsenals, officers and men alike are going over to the Confederacy, but they have absolutely fought at Big Bethel-fought and come off conquerors! our list of wounded and dead is not com- plete, but for one, Winthrop was killed." "Translated you mean," said Geoffrey looking up sud- denly with a kindling light in his eye. "Ranking here after with the Immortals! Such men never thoroughly die, doctor. He has only begun to live!" "Geof, lad," and there was a brokenness in the doc- tor's voice, " don't let your romantic ideas of right carry away all your discretion. I had begun to hope with you that after all we were on the side to conquer, but the way looks dark to me now. Not one single ray of hope can we glean from the events of the past two months. Not one single ray. I tell you, my boy, you are on the wrong side." "Did not Helper prophecy aright?" asked John. "The first blow has been struck between Slavery and Freedom-and let us say with him-' May God defend the right.'" Amen!" said Guy solemnly. "And he will defend it." "It has smitten the nation sorely," the doctor went on, "to 'see a brave young life like Winthrop's go down sud- denly in such darkness. But what is one life, or ten, or fifty compared to this headlong doom to which the very flower of American chivalry is rushing. Geof, dear lad, it is certain death you are going to meet." "What matter, dear doctor?" and the bright face was l'*   'ATHOL.         239 eager and full of honest purpose. "Better die in the shadow of such glory than perish tamely here at home. We only die any way, like everyone else in the end, and why not do something worthy of the life God has given us to make noble, or base and idle, as we shape it for ourselves." "It makes me wild," said the doctor bitterly, " when I think how much our own State has done to bring on this very bloodshed. I tell you we have not begun to see all the fruits of a most swift and just retribution." There was a pause, in which every one looked the dis- pleasure they felt. "In old days," said Geoffrey slowly, and almost under his breath, ' the blood of martyrs was the seed of the Church. It will be so with us. This blood will seal the bond yet more completely. To me, my dear doc- tor, there is a continual question ever sounding in my ears-ever since our brave boys were murdered in'the streets of Baltimore-a question that rings more loudly in my heart since this Bethel disaster, Where is Abel, thy brother?" "And are you, Geoffrey Alger, your brother's keeper," said the doctor fiercely, " that you should answer such a i call?" "Yes." And Geoffrey's voice was low and reverent, as if he felt every word he uttered in his inmost heart. "I am for one my brother's keeper, and his blood calleth to me night and day from the ground. Night and day, night and day, until he shall be avenged." "Pray God rather, for the peace you may never live to see, my boy," and the doctor's voice sounded husky with emotion. "And if I do not live to sing it myself, sing it for me, Miss Harrie-the old triumphal song of Miriam, which every woman in the land shall yet sing-For the Lord     240         ATHOL. shall triumph; the horse and his rider must be cast in the sea. You will sing it for me? Even if I am not here to, hear it, I shall know you are singing it all the same." Harrie turned away quickly. "I have no heart for such a song even now-I should have still less then." And she went to the window and looked out silently,  k although it was quite dark, and there was not a thing to  be seen. Mr. Thorn had been very quietly listening all the time  with never a word to say. To my utter surprise he spoke up hurriedly. "I will go for one! I cannot wait any longer. Beside, I should like to do something in the world, if it's not too late." And then he said softly, only meaning it for Geoffrey's ear- "Something worthy my country, and you, my friend." Geoffrey held out his hand, touched to the heart I could see by the lingering affection ofthe words. "Who am I," he answered, " that I should say,' Come, my friend?' If God has not spoken how shall I?"  It is not for a man to arrogate to himself God's priv- ileges thus," said the doctor with more heat than was necessary. "You may read your Bible until the 'crack of doom' and you will find nothing to justify all this talk. It strikes me sometimes," he went on, "you over good churchmen are almost blasphemous in attributing to God so many of the devil's abominations. I can see nothing in this strife but the evil one marching to andfro on the earth loosed, for a little season; and yet Fotheringham here had the impertinence last Sunday to preach to his people from the text-' I 'came not to send Peace upon earth, but a sword.' I say it was a downright insult to the Almighty to twist that text around to justify the present i \ A t i .. . . .   ATHOL.         241 unholy strife. He is a born incendiary, Greme, although he looks so meek!" Guy colored a little at this direct assault, but opened his mouth sturdily in his own defence. "Don't talk of duty," interrupted the doctor testily. "I never saw a word more wantonly perverted from its original sense. Nine tenths of our clergy are as benight- ed as the heathen in their understanding of it. And we shall never have any peace at all with such men in the pulpit, preaching broadswords and bayonets, I tell you." "It had to come, doctor," said John, speaking for the first time. "It was time for the sword-full time-and now when peace really comes to this troubled land again, these vexed questions will be forever settled. It will be a sure and lasting peace, based on no mean compromise, doctor. It must be *-a blood-bought, hard-earned peace, or it will not be worth the having." ' And are you willing to give your life, John Greme, to this cause you advocate so strongly? Are you ready to be slaughtered in cold blood as these men were the other day?" "No! By Heaven!" said John, " we shall show you on which side the slaughter is yet! There will come a day when our brave boys will not be shot down like dogs as now. All I ask is to see the tide turn, to see for my- self this grand problem of Liberty solved, and then, let death come! I could go boldly forward to meet it, if I knew that was to be the end." ' Then come!" said' Geoffrey impulsively, putting out hji hand. "Come, too. We will show them that all the heroes are not dead yet!" "I will come," said John fiercely. "I could not linger another day in such torment. I am savage and impatient to begin." John's handsome dark face flushed with an eager, I!     242     '    ATHOL. angry light, a light I had seen there too often of late; but as he turned and saw Grace, it all died out instantly. She  made a faint motion as if she would rise, then fell back on her pillow. She put up her hand to her forehead in a  quick, bewildered way.                . "I cannot bear it," she murmured faintly. "It is only such a little while to wait. Oh! John! John!" and her voice, breaking into a bitter cry, reached his ear. He was by her side in an instant, and his arms were about her.                        1 "This excitement is too much for her. We should have been more careful," said Dr. Truman, repentantly. "Take her away, Graeme." But she would not go, only clung to John in a fight- ened, trembling way, whispering over and over again, "It  is only such a little while, such a little while."  He tried to pacify her, but she went on imploringly:  "I cannot bear it! I have given you up all my life until  now, and I must have you near me. You will not leave   : me, John? Say you will not leave me?" He raised his face to hers, white, stern and fixed. "I will not go, darling. I will not leave you. Are you content?" And there was a moment's silence, in which she lay with pale, thankful face, and weary, closed eyes in his arms. He kissed her tenderly again and again, and talked to her with low, soothing voice; but all the flush of enthusiasm had died out, and there was a compressed look of pain about the firm mouth, as if self-control were a hard task. "You will bear your disappointment bravely for my sake?" she whispered. "There is only such a little time left to us now."  And I cannot bear that," and he put his hand upon her lips with a sudden impulse of overpowering love.   ATHOL.         243 But the disappointment his promise caused him lin- gered in his face days and days after this. I knew, as I watched him, he was chafing inwardly at his own idleness in this hour of the country's most desperate need. Darker and darker his face grew as the days fled by, and, as the doctor had predicted, no ray of light or hope greeted our anxious vision. Also, after that day of excitement, we could not fail to see sister grow rapidly worse. Life became more feeble with each daily struggle, and we noted all the fluctuations of her disease with a strange knowledge that would not be put aside. And yet John would not see it. And when it came at last to her leaving the couch where she had lain so long, and remaining in bed all day, arid even needing some one with her at night, yet even then he would not believe she was dying. "It was the sudden heat that had prostrated her," he argued, forgetting it was the very time he had said, three or four months before, that was needed to bring her back to the life she was so absolutely leaving. The season had come for which he had been longing; but soft breezes and sunshine of mid-summer were not for her. She' did not suffer, only lay quietly passing away, with that touching waning of life more pathetic than positive pain. Harrie, subdued into tenderest compassion, was always by her now; and, even to Geoffrey, we gathered together at her bedside, in relations new and sacred, through this bond of sorrow common to us all. Sister had always liked Geoffrey, and it was a pleasure to have him near her. I liked him better when I saw his gentle, compas- sionate manner to her, than at any other time. And he was by her side a great deal. We rode or walked togeth- er very nearly every day, but there was always some por- tion of it allotted to sister. And he would sit and talk to her, softly and tenderly as if he were a woman, of that     244         ATHOL. great and dim Hereafter, which did not seem dim or far  away even to him. You are so young to talk of such things," she said to him one day.               s "War does not always spare the young. And I may be very near the Eternal City for all my youth," he   :; said softly, with a light in his eye only born of sure hope. I may even be there before you."  She closed her eyes as if the thought were pain. I too could not bear it, and turned away. I could not understand either of them. Life looks so bright when the heart is young and no clouds lie in the fair sky over us-  nothing but the rainbow arch of hope--and how can we be ready for death? It was a great mystery how Geoffrey, young, vigorous, and with the promise of a happy future stretching before him, could feel thus.  I turned away and stood by the window overlooking the garden and distant hills, and longed with my old long- i ing to see what was beyond, while they went on talking,  4 { one so wan and feeble, the other so strong and buoyant, of that life which was absolutely nearer to them than this earthly clinging of mine. "I wish I had one grain of faith," I thought. "I wish  I knew what was beyond and in store for me-" and with some remnants of my old Calvinistic dread I 'wondered if [ should ever be elected to such great glory. Oh! ignor- ant heart! It was not until years after that I was content :o take up God's love as he shed it upon me, like the soft ;ummer rain, or sweet sunshine--alike meant for the just Ls well as the unjust. God's creature--cared for, loved nd tended. Oh! if we could only at all times lie in His [ear arms trustfully like little children, and not wilfully Blindfold ourselves!  'The way is open and the path lies straight before," reoffrey used to say to me. "Our church builds up no   ATHOL.         245 barriers in our onward course. No mysteries are given us from God. It is only man's wilful perversion of the truth; that have made even His gracious promises hard to understand." There was scarcely a conversation begun, no matter how idly, that did not somehow get around to this end finally. "You are trying to make me a churchwoman very hard," I said laughingly one day, "and you are forgetting all the time our faith and creed is one and inseparable. We only differ in matters of form, and very little in doctrine- and do you know I think I am quite as well off if I re- main true to my first love? frankly, don't you?" "We do indeed acknowledge one faith, one baptism and one Lord, even Christ-we can meet there on com- mon ground, and I accept your reproof," he said gravely. "And don'- think me a bigot please-but I do love my church." "And so do I," I said quietly, " and I want to love it more; but I cannot feel as you do, you know, beside, I am not anything." "And that is worse than all," with the same grave look on his face. But dre ding a discussion in which I had so little in- terest, I began suddenly to talk of his regiment. The ranks were full and he was very happy. He had raised them without trouble, for Massachusetts' men are not tardy in their patriotism, and Geoffrey was beloved by all who knew him, and they were glad to serve under him. But "marching orders" was the fiery sword which waved threateningly ever before him, to banish him from his "Eden " as he was pleased to term it. How strange it seemed to me-how unreal at times, that Geoffrey should love me so! He, so clever, so man- ly, so handsome; and I, do all I could, only an unformed,     A HOL. ildish little thing, with no guiding principle or faith like! s to control me. I was also too ignorant of the stern  alities of life--too doubtful of my power to make him Ppy-too doubtful, alas! of my own heart. But his ink, earnest homage flattered me. I admired, respect- -yes---.young as he was, respected is the right word-- well as loved him.

It is true, like all foolish young women, I had an ideal-an ideal which sometimes threatened abso- lute presence-and alas! that presence was not Geof- frey's. But my sense of the practical, which never thoroughly left me, kept up a certain kind of equipoise, which, on the whole, was very comfortable and made mat- ters decidedly straight for me. It was not such a great hardship after all, to be en- gaged, you will see. CHAPTERR XIX. ONE day John and I were sitting in the dining-room alone. It was the oddest possible position for me to be in, for he scarcely noticed me now-a-days, and I certainly did my best to avoid him. But it happened thus. I had taken my wor--basket and gone down before breakfast, after which Karrie went to sister, thus leaving me with my embroidery alone. I was making Geoffrey a pair of slippers-though what a man, who expected to be ordered to the front of battle, would do with a pair of such things it would be difficult to say. I was representing a most im- possible and extravagant rose, on a blue ground, with remarkable effect, I thought, when John had come in with paper and cigar, and overlooking me, as usual, dropped indolently into a chair and began to read. Two months ago I would have lighted his cigar for him; instead of which, I now resolutely kept my seat and tried to be ut- terly oblivious of his presence. Apparently glad of quiet, he read and smoked a long time. At last, venturing to steal a glance at his face, our     'o40     ATHOL. *yes met. How long he had been looking at me over the  aper I could not tell, but I blushed, dropped my eyes in-  tantly on my work, and stitched away more vigorousy  han ever. John laid down his paper and came over to the win- ow where I was sitting, looking first out, and finally at  ie for a long time. For my life I could not say a word, Ut I worked on, setting a purple centre to my rose with riginal and surprising effect. Suddenly he burst into ie of his old, rare bursts of laughter. "Why, child, what are you doing?" he aske "For dom are you making the slippers?"F For Geoffrey', I said, with a little warmth and rising or, " and I think them uncommonly pretty."  Uncommonly curious, by Jove! I ain glad you lik m. It would surely be no sin to fall down and worshil m, for the like of it cannot be in the heaven above, o the earth beneath " And again he laughed, and I looked first at my slip- :s and then at him, and fnall y joined in his laughs  "Wouldn't you like to ride out to the camp this morn- "Thank you. I should like it so much." Later in the morning, after Alice had coge up to the i n "And we will send for Alice to stay with sister, son rrie can go, too." "That will be ery pleasant, and like old times," I [, folding up my work. But at the mention of old times, he caught up his er and strode out of the room. Later in the morning, after Alice had come up to the se with her work, we three started off on our ride in I's pleasant little dog-cart. Harrie drove, while I sat e in my glory on the back seat, and from that elevated l   l A I AU.        :49 position hajd a fine view of the country. I knew every inch of it already, but I never tired of its fertile beauty, and we could not any of us avoid an exclamation of pleasure as we rose the crest of the hill and looked over the valley below. John pulled up for an instant, and gave his ponies A little breathing time. It is not at all a cele- brated place. It is only the top of Lenox Hill, just before we go down the old South Mountain, with the quiet, beautiful toWn of Pittsfield spreading out before us, and its old Elm, the pride and the boast of the country side, towering up thin and clear, above all else, in its old age and decay Stalwart still. We could see the glint of water shimmering here and there amid the green, and houses, stately and fair, clustered in the valley and clambered up the hill-sides, and beyond it all, old Greylock undulating in the distance, blue and misty; and we could see the white gleam of tents scattered about-for Geoffrey's regi- ment was not the only one stationed near us. The whole State was a camp, that first battle-summer. There are fifty views set down in Mr. Appleton's very nice Guide Book, as more perfect by far than this; but I always feel like quarrelling with the world at large, in that this particular and favorite point of mine is not placed,par excellence, above all others. Why don't people talk about it, and write of it, and rave over it; all of that perfectness of beauty dwelling peacefully shut in there among the hills? To me, Nature set to work in dead earnest, to see how elaborate and fair she could make this little casket, and then shut it in lovingly on all sides; just framed it, as it were, and declared it finished. It would not be an easy thing to improve it, at all events, I still think. "Trhere Ithey lie," said John, pointing with his whip, after our little survey was ended. And we drove down toward one of the picturesque encampments, with its II*     I           *     250         ATHOL.  broad streets and white tents either side shining in the  sun, which glittered gayly on the bayonets of the guard  walking slowly backward and forward; glinting on the  t stacked guns and bright uniforms and gaudy trappings of: the men. We dashed on through the quiet wood, and were  in the midst of the little white town and its busy inhabi- tants.  One tent larger than the others, with a flag flying at its ,-:: top, we knew as the colonel's. Geoffrey was at its open door, talking to some brother officers, and did not see us until we drew up quite at his side. He turned around quickly at sound of our wheels, and throwing down his ! belt and sash, sprang forward, holding out both hands in " welcome.  "How good of you to come! I did not dare expect this visit-and you know," he went on hurriedly, " we are to leave so soon."  "Indeed, I did not," as he helped me down, and then he whispered: "Be very brave, and help me keep up my courage. It looks terribly earnest now." And not having a chanceto say more, he led us to his  tent, and was hospitably eager to show us around and in- troduce his companions in arms. Poor diminutive Mr. Thorn, looked quite warlike in his new uniform. "He will do," Geoffrey said in answer to some-laugh- ing remark of Harrie's. "There is a brave heart you will find under all that dandyism and sloth. All heroes are small. It is only such great giants as I who are cowards, you know. I always refer to David and Goliath." But I was very proud of my Goliath, and did not doubt his powers or strength, for all he might laughingly say against himself. "When do you move?" inquired John.   ATHOL.         25I "No positive orders yet, but we expect them any moment. The men are anxious to go, and we know the country needs every ready arm. There'll be a new call, for troops soon, you will see." "I hope to heaven," said John energetically, " they'll call for enough this time; five hundred thousand at the least. This thing can be crushed all the sooner, if the country gathers up its strength as a whole, and at once." ( "We shall have some earnest work before that time comes, Graeme!" But there was no flinching in the cool blue eyes that looked down pleasantly into my guardian's, as if he were talking of some summer day excursion, instead of a wild fight for life, with that careless smile on his face that sel- dom left it. While John and Geoffrey were talking, Mr. Thorn had disappeared with Harrie, and I was left alone in the open tent on a camp chair to watch the men. It was a new sight to me, pleasant and picturesque, as well as strange. They were evidently expecting to break camp soon, and were making a great show of activity, cleaning their guns, or polishing buttons, belts and sword hilts. Some lay on the grass, chatting and laughing as carelessly as their young leader set them example. But on most of the faces-sturdy weather-beaten faces they were too- there was a look of quiet determination as well as ill-con- cealed impatience; as if, out away, over the hills, their line of duty lay, and not in idle waiting here. Most of these men had given up home, and wife, and children, and all else which goes to make one's life happy and dear to them, in the first flush of their enthusiasm, and it had deepened quietly and steadily day by day into a settled longing for the word "Forward," which would open to them their new cares. I looked at Geoffrey as he walked among his nmen,     252         ATHOL.  with his hand on John's arm, talking rapidly and earnest- }a ly, but always that pleasant, careless smile on his face, and I did not wonder theirs lighted up as he passed among them, for there was a magnetism in his look and voice that none could withstand. He walked slowly up and down, a gallant, noble figure to me; tall, fair and stately with his tawny locks glittering in the sun; a young giant towering above them all. Up and down they paced, arm in arm, and there was a long, earnest talk between the two. My eyes grew misty as I watched them, wondering first, in a dreamy kind of way of what, or whom, they were talking, and then like a flash leaping suddenly into the future, I thought would they ever walk together this way again, on the sunshiny slope of the hill, with the pleasant breezes blowing clear and strong, and the sky blue and without a cloud. Ah! that future! and then solemnly in my heart the words repeated themselves like a knell-" from battle, and murder and sudden death," and I whispered softly, "Good Lord, deliver us." It was the first time I had ever thought of death as connected with Geoffrey. War meant something horrible to me, no doubt; great desolation in the land for one thing; there was already desolation in the fair southern country, but of one side I had never thought except as victorious. The old war chant of Miriam, which Geoffrey  'had said should yet ring throughout the land, was the song 'I was always singing; yes, even then, though the way looked very dark, and why my eyes should grow so misty I could not tell. But through it all I never thought of death for Geoffrey. Looking at him thus, as he walked to and fro, in all the strength of his manly vigor and beauty, I lost myself in a vision in which anything but death mingled. And a very fair vision it was of the time when the great North, rising in her majesty and strength, should crush out this vile treason brewing all over the   ATHOL..         253 land; when the grand victorious army should march for- ward, conquering and to conquer; when the great, broad, beautiful, star-spangled banner, should float proudly as of old over the whole land. As for Geoffrey, he was, in my eyes, fit at any moment to be Commander-in-chief of this great army of the Republic, and I could only won- der at the President and Secretary's lack of sagacity in not having the like clear vision. That he was going straight forward to glory and the highest honors in the nation's gift, I did not for a moment doubt. And I am not the only child who dreamed such dreams in '6I. So I made no more responses to the Litany, but went on building my castle, wondering again of what they were talking. I knew John had never liked Geoffrey, but they were talking like old and dear friends, and there was no coldness on my guardian's face, as they clasped each other's hands, when they were done talking, in a way which showed it was no light or trifling compact they had been making. Indeed it seemed to me the hand clasp was long and solemn, as if some way they were binding each other to a promise, for on both their faces was a look of quiet understanding of one another, which I had never seen there before. When Geoffrey came back to me he forgot to beg my pardon for leaving me so long alone. He seemed in a manner pre-occupied, and do all he could to steady his voice, there was a tremor in it. "I am going back," he whispered, " to stay all day. Mr. Graeme has asked me to ride with you, so all the rest of the day shall be yours. We cannot tell how soon we may have another." And as soon as Geoffrey began to be solemn, with my usual caprice I was gay, and not a sensible word did I utter on that ride home. And so after a time, the bright, careless smile came back on the face which had grown so     254         ATHOL.  grave after that long talk with John, and the thought that i  we might " not soon have another such day." But after luncheon was over he wanted a "long talk," he said, and we two took our way up among the woods, very silently walking along side by side at first, for in spite of my forced gayety my heart was too full for words. How often that day has come back vividly to me! I 1 seem even now to hear the trees whispering overhead, and I  see the sunlight gleaming through the sweeping boughs, which Geoffrey put aside with his strong hand that Il might pass. lThe day was warm, for summer had come upon us suddenly; but into the cool shade of the wood we loitered, lingering there until the best part of that perfect  day was ended. "It was perhaps the last time," Geoffrey had said, but I would not listen to him.             tH "You forget the furloughs you will have," I said gayly.  "Of course you will come home to me after a time." "Of course I shall come home to you, my darling," answered Geoffrey with his all-abroad, castle-building air. Promoted-- brevetted for bravery probably - a little browned by exposure to a southern sun-something of a'  beard, I hope." "Not a beard!" . interrupted, glad to talk of anything but sober realities. "Anything but that barbarism!" "Very well. Not a beard, your majesty, but a little length to the mustache-or a little dye to rid it of the 'fighting color-' a leg or an arm off, may be-will you love me then for the ' dangers I have passed? ' I will ask you my little Desdemona." "You talk as nonchalantly of losing a limb as of some of your superabundance of hair," and I drew the fair curly head close to mine as I asked truthfully enough, "And what do you think, Geoffrey, will become of me all this long time?"   ATHOL.         255 "You? why youI must go on loving me, and doing your duty. Woman's work in this war will be scarcely second to ours. For one thing, you must encourage me- a wife, you know-" We were walking along under the dark old trees when this momentous co versation took place, I, swinging my round hat in my hanld, idly and carelessly; but I clapped it on my head with a very determined air when he came to this part of his halrangue. "I am not your wife yet, if you please, and don't, Geoffrey, give me a long lecture-on duty. How dare you leave me here alone for six or seven months, with all the interesting ' Home Guard' parading about in their fine uniforms, and Dr. Truman coming up to the house very nearly every day and possibly-" And I was going to have one of my perverse fits, but Geoffrey ended it by finishing my sentence for me. "I may be shot! very true. How little one thinks of such possibilities when one lacks nothing to render the hope of a happy fu ure complete! My little one! my darling, I wish indeed you were my wife!" It had never seemed to me within the limits of possi- ble probability that I should ever call this man my hus- band.;. but as I looked up in the blue eyes and saw all the grave, tender yearning come into their depths, that he had been striving to put away all day, I threw my arms about him in a sudden imFulse of tenderness and grief-grief above all that I was so little worthy to bear the sacred name of wife. "Come and sit 'y me," he said tenderly, trying to stop my tears. "I must tell you now no good is gained by delay. We break camp and move to-morrow. The telegram came while I was talking with Mr. Graeme to-day." My heart gave a sudden throb, then grew quite still.   .     256         ATHOL. "And I have only to beg," he went on, the grave look deepening on his face, " that you do not make it any  harder for me to go than-it is at present. Try and be brave, for my sake, little one, try and give me a little cour-  age. I haven't as much as I need, I am afraid. And now that I am going away," averting his eyes, " that this may be  even the last time we shall wander together among these K hills, give me something to carry away with me, more dear  and precious than any other remembrance possibly can be.  Tell me now, what you have never once told me yet,  darling-tell me you love me wholly and entirely. Answer  me truly, as you will answer at the last great day, are you ; indeed all my own, my little love?"         X A strange impulse of compassion and tenderness swept over me when I heard the pleading, manly voice,  but I could not tell him that which he longed to know; a  strange perversity kept me silent, and made my heart beat  and my color come and go. But I looked up through my  tears and laughed, and called him a dissatisfied boy, and  a tyrant, but not the words he longed to hear did I say. X "Forgive me," he said quietly, after an instant's silence, "if I have asked too much. I must try and be  content with the crumbs you deign to fling me."  "I do love you," I said, repentantly. "1 cannot tell  how much. I only know it is not all you deserve to have,  and yet, Geoffrey, I can give you no more," I said with a little sudden effusion, "no more than myself." "And I must be content, and not forevgr sigh for the  unattainable." But he took my hands in his, bending down and kissing them again and again, and not trusting himself to speak forjsome time. I did not dare look in his eyes, grave and tender as I knew they were, and when he spoke again it was not of love, but of that great, dim possibility of which he had that morning, for the first time, spoken. Perhaps it would   ATHOL.         257 not be all victory, nd honor and peace for us. It might be, rather, death, or wounds, or defeat. The coming struggle might stri us of all liberty as well as life. 'The right did not alwtys prevail; and then in his quiet," deeply-religious way, Geoffrey went on talking of that change which coud come to him, as well as to other young lives, gone ut suddenly in the last few months; and in the silence of that summer day, just ending, he spoke-to me sole nly of life and love, and death and eternity, and that hope which lighted up even the dark terrors of the tomb W( We must take o false views of life or duty, my little one," he said. "We do not live for ourselves." "And yet," I  nswered, suddenly sobered by his earnest words, " you want to live, Geoffrey? You cannot regard life as of no value." "Ah! no," he a swered, with a deep, full breath, "I love my life. It is a bright world, and the castles I have built are, fair palac s. Life andd love, youth and hope, hand in hand, are bewildering, intoxicating joys; but an eternal life, an eternal youth, above all, an eternal love- if it is worth living for, it is worth dying for. And these things soften the pain of parting even from you, dear love." "Don't tell me so," I said shudderingly. "Only a few moments ago we were talking as carelessly as a couple of children, and no you terrify me beyond expression. Pray don't say anything more about dying-it will haunt me until you come ack." "And I may nev r come back, and for just that reason I must say all I want to now. I have tried so many times, but I could not bear o sadden you. Would you?" and his voice was tremulou , ever so little, "would you grieve very much if I were never to come back?" "How can you a k?"     258         ATHOL.              I And I dropped my head upon his outstretched arm, which held me closely-so closely-and the tears would  come in spite of my effort to keep them back. "And now, while we are talking so soberly, you must :l just,let me say a few words more. I have made your young life all my own--if I live. But if I die?--mourn for me. I want it. God knows I want some of your tears, my love, but beware of a false sentiment. Love is eternal. It outlives the grave, and thank God there is no marriage, or giving in marriage, in the heaven of our  hopes. And my little darling must take her life and hap-  pinessas the Giver of good sends them to her." I raised my head- and looked at him wonderingly.  "And you want me to do like every one else-after a time forget you? oh! Geoffrey."            ;:$ "I do not think you will ever forget me. We do not under any circumstances ever thoroughly forget; but time heals all griefs, and brings other joys, and I want you to  be happy----always, my darling-always happy-remem-  ber that. If, in the years to come, I ever become to you  a tender memory, remember what I have said to-day. Be happy with some  other man. Some one, more worthy perhaps than I ever could be of your love." I could not say one word to all this; only sat still, i listening in pained and utter bewilderment. "Bear in mind I  want.,to live,".he went on. "One day I  hope to call this little girl my wife. One day I hope to i have her tell me of her own free will, as I have told her ' I  love youbeyond all else in this world--I love you now, and will love you in the life to come.' I can wait until then," he said, almost under his breath. And then he smiled, and asked " was he talking too soberly for me?   might he say a little, just a very little more?" "Not another word!"I said. Not, another word   ATHOL.          2 259 about dying. I coud never let him go if he were to look upon it as going to certain -death." And so we walked soberly, half sadly home, in the fall. ing twilight, each too busy with our own thoughts for fur- ther speech. Harrie stood at the door waiting for us. "I am so glad you are come at last," she said, and when I looked up inquiringly in her eyes, I saw they were full of tears. "Sister has been asking for you both," she explained. "She is so much wcrse-I know she is so much worse. And John is away-what shall we do?" And we all three went on to her room without waiting for another word. The windows were open, and the purpling twilight was fast filling the room. Alice was by her side reading a lttle Evening Hymn, a favorite with us all- "Abide with me, fast falls the eventide." She stopped when she came to the last verse, and could go no further. Then Geoffrey quietly took her place and finished it. "Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes; Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies; Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee; In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me." When he -had end ed she opened her eyes and smiled holding out her hand to him and to me. "My little legacy," she whispered, "( come here, near me," and as I bent to kiss her, I noticed a change, an aw- ful change, since I parted from her that morning. Her cold slender fingers clasped my hand and Geoffrey's tO- gether. "This is as I want it," she said. "She was bequeathed to me, and I give her in turn to you, Geoffrey. I love to think of her as yours, my dear. It is a com-     260         A'HOL.  fort to me now." Then to me: "Does it not seem strange, little one, that I shall see your mother so soon? Nineteen years nearly, to be separated and then to meet! I told you once of her prayer for you-keep it al- K ways in your heart, my child-that and another, 'that  the children whom He has given me,' may all meet together in heaven." And Geoffrey reverently said, Amen.              ' Would John never come? where was he, and what  dim horror was looming up before me? I could not stay  here, and I slipped my hand from Geoffrey's and the cold fingers joining ours, and crept out through the dark hall  to the open door, and sank down upon its threshold to wait for John's coming; that threshold which I had  crossed for the first time nearly a year before, a doubting, fearful child. How changed all was since then, and how  long it seemed in looking back! All around was un- changed, but within, alas! no happy party gathered. One waiting to be gone, longing eagerly for that land "where she could run and not be weary, and walk and not faint,"  and another with a look of immortality in his clear eyes, i which I had never seen there before to-day. How soon  we should be scattered-we, who were gathered together  so solemnly, in this dear home, waiting in the fading sun- light! waiting, for what? And a great awe and trembling fell upon me, as I heard the tramp of Hector's hoofs, coming nearer and nearer, up the gravelled avenue, then stop before the door.  "Alone?" he said, as he leaped from his horse, and i stood by my side. "Why, what has happened?" as I tried to speak, but the words died away unuttered. I only took his hand and led him toward sister's room. He paused a moment at the door before opening it, holding my hand, no, rather crushing it in his, and then he went in; softly and quietly went up to her side, leaning over -  [ ! ,   ATHOL.          261 and kissing her, just as he had done so many months; just as he had done very probably all his life. She opened her eyes, smiling into his, but over the white face there was swiftly coming a change-such a change as only comes once to us all. John saw it and stooped to hear what the white lips were trying to say. "Kiss me, John." Again and again he kissed her, the hot tears falling upon her face. It seemed so strange to see my guardian weep such tears, he so cold and calm, but his whole frame was con- vulsed with agony as she fell back with a low, gasping sigh like a sob on his arm. It had come at last, and for her there was no more tears or pain, or death. What passed for the next few minutes I never could distinctly recall. I only remember Geoffrey's taking me in his arms, and letting me sob out my grief and terror sheltered there. John seemed stupified and horror- stricken. He neither wept or moaned now; only sat still, vacantly looking before him in a dreary, utterly helpless way, never noticing any one, not even the doctor, whom some one had summoned suddenly. When at last they tried to rouse him, he got up slowly, walked straight past us to the library, and we heard him locking the door. The weary hours went slowly by after this. Down stairs, there in the room, sanctified forever to us now by the. dear memories of the past, lay the one who had been mother,.as well as sister, to this household for so long. In the next room John paced, solitary, and refusing to be comforted. He never came near us all of that long, sad evening. Geoffrey had gone before the tea-bell sounded drearily, and the summons was unanswered by any of us. In days that were passed, we had taken this meal either in John's cabinet, or sister's; but the servants seemed to     262         ATHOL.              : understand intuitively that it was ended now, and tea was laid in the dining-room. We had none of us any heart  for food, but we waited for John. Guy and Alice came in  while we were waiting, but John did not come. Poor  Alice! In her quiet way I think she was nearer to  sister's heart than any of us.  It was a sad evening. We did not light our lamps, but , sat talking to each other, first in the darkness, then in the moonlight, talking reverently and lovingly as people will i do of the dear dead; recalling all the tender words and  loving acts of the pure saint who had entered upon her 1 rest; treasuring up old, fond words and half-forgottei counsel, and thus prolonging our grief.  I sat by the window. The moonlight poured in full  upon us; it lay in a broad white sheet upon the gravel ? outside, and the trees flung black shadows across its whiteness. I saw another shadow fall across it, tall and I  dark, standing irresolutely as if half afraid to enter. I \ got up softly, and went out to meet it. Unlike most shadows, it clasped me close in a strong, manly embrace. "Forgive me, darling," he whispered, "if I intrude upon your sorrow; but I cannot forget how soon we are to part." "I am glad you are come," I whispered, with a sud- den sense of protection. "It has been a sad, sad day, and we are all so grieved. It is such a horrible thing tp die," I said shudderingly; "but oh! more horrible than all, this burial which must come." "It is only the body," he said softly. "We must not forget that. The freed spirit is away, aloft beyond the stars, in the Paradise of God."  "But it is the body we have loved," I argued. "WIe cannot think of the soul only." "It is a great mystery," he said, "this dying to Iive. To be no more, yet to be. To cease here and begin the   ATHOL.         263 great life hereafter. When I first thought of it, like you I shrunk from the horror of the grave. I forgot that Christ, walking on before, had lit up the way, and that it was no longer dark. And these things will come to you too after a time, my darling." He leaned down, kissed me, and smiled with that far away look on his face which he had worn all day, and which I could not understand. And then, under the shadow of the roses which clam- bered about the porch, he drew me to his side, and talked long and earnestly--I cannot begin to think of all he said to me, but it was a comfort, such comfort after all to see and hear him, and know I was so beloved. And then too, his faith and trust gave me strength as I listened, while we talked of sister, and her peaceful "falling on sleep." That last night with Geoffrey made a sad ending to a sad day. "He would not come to-morrow," he said! Indeed he could not, for they would be up and away early, and there was much to be done. But his voice faltered when he went into the drawing-room to say good-bye to the others, while I waited for him in the porch. I saw him go up to the window in the bright moonlight and say fare- well to them all, and I listened in a sort of apathy and bewilderment to the few simple words of sympathy and affection which he uttered. Harrie had been subdued and quiet in her grief at sister's death, which was not what I expected; but when Geoffrey, bending over her, took her hand in his and said how he grieved to leave them all in their sorrow, a sorrow he shared, and would she look upon him as a brother, and say good-bye to him as such, she fell into his arms with a sobbing, inarticulate cry, and wept as I had never heard her weep before. But she did not say a word, not even the farewell he had asked for, and when he came back to me he, too, i            * i     264         ATHOL.  was silent, and took me in his arms, holding me there so long and closely that I looked up wonderingly, until I saw his eyes were full of tears. And then I looked at him pitifully. "It is hard for you to go, Geoffrey." "It is like death to leave you," he said in a low-voice, holding me close to him. "Do not go yet," I faltered. "Only stay a little longer." "And I gain nothing by delay. I only lose coura e and hope, and I need them both. But if I,never coine back---" "Don't, don't," I cried with a bitter cry. "Only say good-bye without that. You will come back to me. Ybu must come back to me." "God bless you! my darling; now and always. Pray that I may indeed come back to you; but pray, too, that I may be as ready for battle and death as for your dear love; that when I do come back I may be a stronger, braver and better man." He  stooped and put his arms about me; long and closely he held me, and I shut my eyes and felt as if in a dream, while he kissed my forehead and lips; he touched even my curls and my two hands with lingering, loving kisses, then he put me softly away from him, and without another word, left me standing under the roses in the moonlight, alone. He never knew, poor Geoffrey, how I walked down to the gate and watched him, as he went down the hill, watched, until he disappeared in the shadow of the wood; and he also never knew how I went up to my own room, with a sense of want, and loss, in my life, that I had never felt before. I could not sleep, and there was the moon staring blankly at me through my open window, just to put the   ATHOL.         265 idea into my head of sitting up, and gazing at it, and feel- ing more than ever sorrowful, as one always does 'under its melancholy light. So I yielded to the spell and slip- 'ping on my white wrapper, I laid my head on the window sill, and sobbed out all my sorrow there in the night, alone. And yet not alone. For under the shade of the trees stood, for how long I could not tell, the tall, dark shadow, which I had gone out to meet, only so little time before. I drew back and hid myself in the curtain, with a wondering feeling of awe and bewildered possession of so much love. And all this time, under my window, in sister's room, gleamed the little taper, where the watchers were gather- ed, and where she so lately had been. And through the long, long night I heard John's footsteps pacing up and down--weary and tired they sounded-until the moon went down and Geoffrey had gone away, and the house was still. Then I crept to bed, with those weary foot- steps sounding still in my ears. Was it not strange that my last thought that night should be, not Geoffrey, but John?-poor John. CHAPTER   XX. OURS was a silent, sorrowful house, for days and days after this. 'The weary hours went by slowly and sadly, and we had no heart to go back to our ordinary employ- ments which had been broken in upon so suddenly by sister's death. Looking for it so long, knowing it must colme, and yet coming it found us sleeping. Let it be ex- pected never so completely, it must alw'ays come with a     266         AT1'HOL. suddenness to the hearts which are ever unprepared or  the dread messenger.  We met at meal-time as usual, and yet, though we were the same number who gathered around the table, even there we missed the gentle presence: and we withdraw w quietly and each took up the burden of the new day f1or themselves: each with a loss and void in their heart, - which only time and God could heal.  John, for his part, was in his library nearly all of the  time. We never mlet now, as of old, in the pleasant gash-  ering place which Harrie had called the "Museum," tut that, together with sister's was closed and darkened, and  left with only memories. John never entered either of  them. Indeed he never went anywhere r-not even to te  Lea; and he did not care to see the doctor; they were  past quarrelling with one another. He did not even seem  to regard with interest the news of the day. War and peace were alike indifferent to him. Death had with-  drawn the objections to his entering the army, but his  heart had apparently'wearied of the strife. As for Geoffrey, I heard from hini almost daily. The  camp was placed, he wrote me, just out of Washington, and they expected orders soon. His letters were: my life just at this time, for I was so lonely and sad; and Harrie  had changed almost as completely as John, and was alone,- and pre-occupied a great deal of the time, except whea the doctor came up to see us. He had taken it upon hilr - self to be very good and gentle to us all, more so, perhaps, to Harrie than any of us, and they would go out for long rides together, " which'was surely very kind of him," Alice would say, " only that it leaves you, Athol, so much alone.' And I would answer, "Very kind-and I have my German and music to occupy me, besides my daily letter to write to Geoffrey, you know;" but I felt very lonely, all the same, and would have given worlds if John had unbent l   ATHOL.         267 very little more to me. But he rarely noticed me, or any one else, by word or look, and seemed to be utterly lost in despondency and gloom. It was in June that Geoffrey went away. Hardly a month had passed, yet it already seemed so long. There had been a new call for troops-five hundred thousand this i time, as John had hoped, but beyond a few skirmishes and monstrous " marching up-hill, and the marching down again," no great or decisive battle had yet been fought. But our army, under McDowell, was slowly settling down toward Manasses, and Johnston, it was rumored, was about to reinforce Beauregard. Geoffrey wrote me that a battle, and a great and important one, was impending; but he wrote confident of success, and whatever of doubt or gloom he had at parting, it was evidently gone, and he felt only a mad enthusiasm to be up and at work-and with his intensely sensitive and earnest nature such work meant life. There was not a shadow of anything but buoyant, exalted hope, in his letters at this time; not a dread of failure, or death; nothing but unbounded suc- cess. It is no wonder his letters gave me new courage, and that I sometimes forgot how solemn and earnest had been our farewell. One day when I had been alone in my room much longer than usual, and Harrie had been gone for two or three hours, riding with the doctor, I sat by my window, watching them as they drove in, and up to the porch. As he helped her out, and' stopped for a moment to say a few last words, I noticed Harrie's face and thought how much brighter it had grown-brighter than I had seen it since sister's death. It is as Alice said, I thought, so kind of the dear old doctor, and these rides are doing her good. And with that I went on with my reading. There had been a little dash of cavalry, and a division of rebels had been routed. I was wondering if Geoffrey's name     268         ATHOL.. would ever be in print, like that young lieutenant's of whom I had been reading, when Harrie came in. She threw off her hat and gloves, dropping into a seat by the other window. "Pleasant ride, Hal?"' I asked. "Very." And I finished the column and then fell to idly talking again. "Athol," said Harrie suddenly, "come over here ; I want to talk to you."  "Can't you say what you want to if I sit here?"I asked, in a very preoccupied manner, it is true, for I was thinking of Geof's regiment just then, and not of any- thing Harrie Grame could say to interest me. "You know I could never tell you a thing if you sat there in the window, bolt upright like a stake, and no in- terest at all for me in your face. No, come here and sit by me, or I won't say a word." So I got up'and took the easy chair opposite helrs. She was curled up in the other one very like a huge kit- ten, and when I looked in her face I saw the very faintest perception of annoyance there.  "Why, what has happened?"I asked involuntarily, "Nothing much."              \ And here she became meditative, and I followed suit and went back to Geoffrey. I had him in my mind's eye just then, at the head of his men, making a most brilliant charge upon a party of discomfited chivalry, and was sur- rounding him with a triumph and glory which scarcely fell short of Alexanders, when I was roused with an im- patient-  "You will drive me mad. Athol Derwent! What are you thinking of?'- And I blushed very consciously And stammered something about my wonder if Geof had seen any service yet, and if his name would be in the papers    A'rFHOL,           269 before long. "Veni, vidi, vici," I thought, with a childish pride in my young hero-lover, and the great Federal army generally. She gave a shrug of her shoulders at finding me so obtuse, and in her headlong fashion plunged into her business at once. c"Dr. Truman has been making a fool of himself, as usual," she said bluntly. "Ah! indeed? Nothing new in your eyes." "Yes, but this time he has made even more of a fool of himself than usual. He has been making love to me!" "To you?" And I did look interested. "Yes, to me!" mimicking my surprised tone; and then suddenly, "What upon earth shall I do?" "How can you ask? Be a sane woman and refuse him at once. You cannot mean for one instant you have thought of accepting him?" "No," she answered irresolutely. "He is too old, for one thing." "By all means, too old; beside, you have always hated the sight of him." "Indeed I have not!" she interrupted, turning a slightly-flushed cheek toward me. "He is a good, true, noble man; far too noble to waste a thought upon me." "Very true," I acquiesced; and she went on. "He is just the man to guide my erring judgment, with his own cool, well-disciplined mind; just the one to curb my impulsive, hasty temper; just the one to look up to and respect mi every sense." "But one," I interrupted. "He is as hot-headed a copperhead as the veriest Southron, for all he keeps so quiet now." She put her hand over my mouth quickly.   270         ATHOL.  "You shall not finish it! You are just like all the rest of our brothers and sisters across the water-you only come here to quarrel and find fault with us, when you  - know the merest nothing at all of us, any way." l "But Geoffrey says--"  "But the doctor says-" and she shook her head at me again. "No, no, let us leave politics alone--it is, real- ly, not our forte. What upon earth, Atholinda Derwent, shall I do?" going back again to the exigency of the case. Harrie never was guilty of giving me my full length, barbarity of a name, unless she was desperately in ear- nest. "If I were to give advice," and I put on as much dig , nity as a girl lately engaged could assume, "I should sat it was a sacrifice too great to tolerate for an instant. You young, handsome, attractive--you need not shake you: head-you know you are attractive--"Let me see--Doc  tor Truman is fifty?"             - "He is nothing of the kind! he is only forty-five!" ; "Only forty-five! well that is not a very tender age--  beside, he looks fifty--this country practice wears a man R out before his time, and you are eighteen."        "How can you be so perverse-you know I am nearly  nineteen."  "That leaves a balance on your side of twenty-six years, if my arithmetic is right. It's a good long start,  Hal, he has of you. See now-when he is a decrepit,  palsied old man, you will be a young, prematurely old woman. Nonsense! Doctor Truman is growing child- ish!" There was a long silence, while Harrie, with a flush on her fair young face, was going through some mental ex- ercise she did not reveal, and very naturally having dis- posed of the doctor,- I went back to my dream again. "Athol," said Harrie, suddenly breaking the silence.   ,      -     ATHOL.          27I1 and setting to flight a whole regiment of horse and foot, "Athol, after all, he is a very fine-looking man." "You always thought so," I said. "You were always raving of his beauty, you know, even before I saw him." She raised her eyebrows ever so slightly. "I cannot say much for the beauty," she answered with a little smile, " only his eyes, and they are very, very beautiful. There is so much depth of expression." "Yes, but his beautiful amber hair is his greatest charm." "Amber hair? Who upon earth are you talking of now," half petulantly. "Geoffrey, of course," I answered in astonishment. "Athol Derwent, you are simply a fool! I was talking of the doctor ;" then suddenly, "You are in love with the captain after all, brother John to the contrary!" What did John say?"I asked defiantly, all the blood rushing to my face and neck in a torrent. He said you were only pleased and captivated-and -piqued. He would not give that," and she snapped her fingers, " for all the love you ever brought to Geoffrey Alger!" All my pride flamed in my heart at this sudden accu- sation. "I will tell you," I said, " what I never would tell even to him, though it was the last thing he asked of me. I do love him, and I mean one day to marry him, and make him a good wife too. But I could not tell him' so, Hal- I don't know why." "And I don't know why either," she answered bluntly. "If you really love a person why can't you say so." "And do you really love the doctor? If you do. say so." She turned around, putting both her hands on my shoulder and looking down in my eyes, laughing all the time.     272  -       AtOL.  "There's just the trouble, Athol, my dear. I think in my off-hand way I have loved him very. nearly all my life." "Then' marry him, Hal, if he were old as Methusa- lah!" t "That's just what I told him I should do this morn- ing, and now, my dear, you know it all." And so she went down the stairs, singing softly to her- self, for the first time since sister had left us, and I knew she was happy; and then I longed so much, so very much, that I was as truthful and straightforward and happy as she-for even to myself sometimes I was worse than a contradiction-I was a cheat, and a lie.  CHAPTER XXI.             F "HARRIE! Harrie!'Where are you?" It was John's voice calling her at the foot of the stair- case. I got up, book in hand, and, went out to meet him, nearly running against him'in the hall. "Harrie is gone riding with the doctor," I said. - Did you want her?" "Of course I wanted her, or I should not have called her--and she is never here when I want her lately." I "Won't I do as well?" "No;" and he spoke impatiently-, I am sick unto death of billing and cooing! It has been the only employ- ment going on in this house for a year-and above all things deliver me from af ancient turtle dove!" He had not said as many words to me in weeks, and it was absolutely delightful to have him ill-tempered   ATHQL.          273 again; so just for the sake of 'prolonging the conversa- tion, I said, "I thought the doctor and Harrie behaved very sensibly." He made no answer to this remark, but was going down the stairs, when I made one more effort to detain him. , Perhaps I could help you if you will let me take Har- rie's place." He said "no," at first--then-" well, would I be wil- ling to do a little writing for him?" "Certainly I would -with pleasure." He looked keenly at me when I said this, but did not even give me ' thanks " for my condescen- sion; only walked down stairs, I following him. As he opened the library door I saw everything was in great confusion. His valise was open, half packed, and a pile of clothes on the floor tossed by it; his table was strewn and littered; the desk drawers were open, and al- together he looked as if he were about to move, not only himself, but everything in the room as well. "Was he going away?"I stopped confusedly at the open door, holding fny book still in my hand. His eye just glanced at the title, and a half smile came to his lips. "Don't read such maudlin trash, child! Throw it away. Mother Goose would do better." "You read it to us yourself," I said, my face flushing. "I took it up just where you left it--see your mark." I was sorry after I had spoken, for the last time he read it was at sister's request, and in. an instant there flashed across Me the pleasant evening we had all spent together, and how John had read, and Dr. Truman fidg- eted, until coming to-"Maud was just seventeen "-the poor doctor, had declared " she was such a fool " he would hear no more, and gave us the "New York Herald" instead; and how he and John had quarrelled the rest of the evening over politics, and how kind 'and loving I2*     274         ATHOL. John was to me, when all had gone and we were alone-  i that was before I was engaged to Geoffrey. It was only a little while ago, but how long it seemed since the cold black eyes had looked kindly on me. "I am sorry," I stammered, "I forgot "-for I saw he remembered that evening too. He sighed heavily. "  Ah!" he said, in an entirely changed tone, "it seems ages since I read from that book-forget it, child-forget everything-you are young, and can forget," he added bit- terly. I saw he was sad and unhappy, and his face had such a weary, worn look, it frightened me. I longed to help him-to console him-but that I knew I could not do. I gave a glance at the desk, where his open letters lay, then athis valise and disordered clothes. ' Are you going away?"I faltered. "Yes, and I must have these deeds copied. Can you do it quickly? Here-" he took up a package of papers, opened them, spread pen, ink and a large sheet before me, drew up a chair to the table, and waited for me to begin. "Are you going away for a long time?"I asked again, taking up my pen, but the whole room went round  and round before me and I was conscious of but one thing -he was going away-would have gone away without a word-a good-bye even. "Only for a short time," he answered, half impa- tiently, "on business-would I be .kind enough to make haste?" So I had nothing to do but begin my copying, going at it steadily and accurately, although my heart was beat- ing like a drum, and my pulses actually bounding. For nearly an hour I must have sat there, writing rapidly, while John, after packing his valise, writing one or two let-   ifg t        ATHOL.         275 ters, got his hat and cane, and stood waiting for me. A few moments and it was done. He looked over my shoulder, scanning it thoroughly, and me, as well, I im- agined. It was well done, I knew. I had taken pains with it, but he had not the grace to say " thank you." I heard his horse brought around to the door. Hector al- ways disliked to stand. He was tearing up the gravel, and pawing, and John heard it as well as I, but 'he did not move; only stood there by my chair, staring down at me. "When will you return?"I asked, anxious to break the silence which was uncomfortable in the extreme. "Oh! I don't know. Hasn't Harrie come yet?" "No, she will not be back until dark." "You are lonely here, aren't you?" "I am never lonely," I said, with the most unblushing hardihood. "I believe I am ' sufficient unto myself,'" with a half smile. (' Ah! yes, I forgot." He passed his hand over his eyes in a troubled sort of way. "How would you girls like to go down to the rectory, and shut up the house for a time?" "I wouldn't like it at all," I said hastily, " and I don't believe anything would tempt Harrie to go there, in that little, cramped-up, close place, this beautiful summer weather, and this great, lovely old home deserted." "It is not lovely to me any longer-it is horrible! I am dying and stifling here-I must go away." And he walked to the window, turning his back upon me and looking out. My heart ached for him. He was lonely, sad and unhappy. What right had I to expect kindness and atten- tion from him when his heart was nearly breaking. I went up to him and slipped my hand within his arm-tim- I *     276         ATHOL.               ' -l idly enough--ut I could not resist the sudden impulse. : He started, looked down, gave his shoulders a little shrug,  but he did not put me away.                X I remained perfectly still by his side. At last he said, without looking down at me, "What is the matter, child?"  "I have been thinking," scarcely above my breath,  i  and then stopped. "Of what?" with his old persistence. "Of you," I whispered. "I am almost as unhappy as yourself," with a burst of truthfulness--" your coldness, ^ your avoidance of me-since-since-"I stopped, for I could not speak Geoffrey's name to him. He finished it  for me.                         . ; "Since you have chosen another guardian, you would  say," and he turned his black, searching eyes upon me. I saw he was determined to part from me in one of   5? his cold, overbearing moods, but I was resolved, now, he was so unhappy, I would not notice it.  I gave utterance to a half inarticulate denial. "You need not tell me," he answered bitterly. "You have been unjust to me, unjust to yourself, and precipitate  with the captain; and yet I am sure-almost sure, Athol- - you have been more unjust to him after all than any one else." I felt the blood mounting to my cheeks. If he wished to force at confession from me this surely was no way to do it; but I was so nervous by this time, I could not keep the tears from rushing to iny eyes. He saw it and with- drew his arm a little-impatiently from mine, for what man can endure the sight of tears? it always acted as an irri- tant on John, and because I felt I was doing the worst possible thing I could do, I just gave way to a perfect passion of crying-half anger it was too, I must confess if I regard truth, at my lovely attempt at consolation, and   ATHOL.         2" my failure in bringing around a pleasant reconciliation. And, utterly indignant, I sobbed on, while John grew pro- portionately sulky. At last he took out his watch. "You have conducted yourself in such an extraordi- nary manner, Athol, that I am entirely at a loss how to understand you; beside, you have detained me so I have not time to settle my papers and arrange my desk." His tone was quite cool by this time. "You were so anxious to help me that I'll have to trouble you still further." He took up the letters he had been writing. "Let Owen take these to the office in the morning-and, stay, this is pro- voking-here is Barker's account-tell Harrie she must overlook it." "Cannot I do it?" independently swallowing my sobs and vexation together, and rising with alacrity. "You are very thoughtful of Harrie!" wilfully misun- derstanding me. "'A fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind '-well, you can do it. You'll find it in here-take your time." He tossed the papers into an open drawer, taking up his valise to go. Not another word-not" good-bye " even-not a hand- clasp. He might have parted from a servant or dog in more of a spirit of friendliness. He had reached the hall door, when yielding to a sud- den impulse, I was, in an instant, by his side. "You shall not go so," I said imperiously, " you shall say good-bye-I will not let you leave me here alone this way!" "Good-bye, then, since you care for it so much," he said half regretfully, and leaning down he just touched my forehead with his lips, coldly enough, and then was gone. I was not angry. I was simply furious. I took out     278         ATHOL. my handkerchief and very nearly scalped myself in my frantic endeavors to get rid of the hateful kiss. I did not ask for that, I thought with crimson cheeks. I only wanted the good old-fashioned English word " good-bye," with a clasp of the hand in something like Christian amity. Well, I was resolved upon it I would go back into benighted heathenism after this--I would--yes-I would cry-a woman's only alternative, and this time I did cry, and was infinitely relieved thereby. I was still sitting down on the threshold of the open door, where I had dropped to enjoy this same cry, when I saw Owen return- ing from the depot. I put up my hand and beckoned him, and he came around the drive, up to the door. "What train did your master take, Owen," I asked, shading my eyes from the sunlight with my hand. "Five o'clock New York Express, miss. It is only to the city he is going." "Five o'clock?"I said in surprise. "Is it so late- well, you may go, Owen. Yes-I knew he was going to the city." And I walked back into the library, and sat down in John's chair, feeling enough of his presence still to be uncomfortable, and hardly daring, with the remembrance of his contemptuous glance ever before me, to go on with the arranging of his papers. I had never been in this room but once or twice in my life., He had told me when I first came that"c Homer was just the thing for that alcove "-but very few invita- tions did I get to form Homer's or any one else's acquaint- ance, in this room. And since he had cast me off so en- tirely 1 had never dared think of coming here until to-day. It was a pleasant, sunshiny old room, with great broad windows, and an endless amount of books filling the re- cesses, and was a tempting retreat enough for any one. I I    ATHOL.         279 sat first in one chair, then another, like "Little Silverhair " in the Bear's Cave, feeling a sense of liberty and ease, since John's presence was withdrawn, which was delightful. Then I began looking over the books-good solid mat- ter-hardly a novel among them, except "Pendennis" and "Vanity Fair." Humph!"Becky Sharp was just the one to suit John," I said maliciously; " well, I'll not be a lit- tle soft thing like Amelia, and cry any more." So I walk- ed around, examining furniture, books and pictures, say- ing very pleasantly, "Enjoy yourself, Athol, my dear-- make yourself perfectly at ease by all means." By and by I settled down to Barker's account, with this "fellow feeling," for Harrie tempting me to throw the whole thing out of the window, instead of being so " won- drous kind," as John had suggested with such a sneer on his handsome, dark face. Ah! well-it did not take me long. John was wonderfully methodical and accurate in all he did (which by the way was not what one would expect to find in a man like John Graeme), but that day in his haste and excitement things were sadly littered-. All the drawers were open and the papers were thrown about; suddenly I thought, this was the very old desk Harrie had once told me of---the desk where she found the portrait of Adele. ' And I mean to see it too," I said, starting up. "It is just the opportunity." I had not thought of her in a long, a very long time, Harrie and I having "laid that ghost" and exchanged it for Miss Marshton. But now was my chance-now or never. I opened two or three of the drawers a little wider, and peeped in with an odd feeling of shame, standing irreso- lutely before them and not daring to lift a thing. "He told me to arrange his papers," I said, excusing the act to myself, " and if I chance to see a miniature, what harm to look,-any one would do the same thing,-it is not like reading a letter-I would not do that." And so     280          ATHOL. solacing myself for my curiosity I opened drawer after drawer. "He has destroyed it," I said, but even as I A spoke, my hand touched the little black case--old, faded, J and worn-it must be the one-I pressed the spring, and lo! the fair, beautiful face I had longed to see, was look- ing at me! The eyes were so blue and mocking I felt they X were almost living eyes reproaching me, and I dropped it  and walked back to the window, only to come back again t X and carry it to the light, and look at it still more earnestly, laughing at my own cowardice. "Just such a face as you'd go crazy over, Athol,",  : Harrie had said. Truly it was-and then I thought again,i  she was a little, just a little more like Georgie Marshton / than any one whom I had ever seen before--more fault- lessly beautiful even than she--with her fair, crispy curls ; clustering over her temples-not falling upon her shoul- ders, but gathered up--and held by a little band, with a,  pale pink rose set jauntily on one side-real "Frenchy,"  with blue and pink flowers knotted at the corsage front, , which fell off the shoulders, mistily, and was set off by the circle of brilliants around it. I took it out of the case and flashed it in the sun, wondering all the time who and what she could be, and why so much loveliness should be shut away from sight in that ugly old black case. I turned the miniature on the back, and there read "Adele. Paris i8-," and under it in tiny letters, "Sans Varier." Very clearly an old love of John's. Was she dead? If she were alive and " unchanged," why was she not here in living reality? the miniature bore a date twenty years back-if she were living she would be an old woman-as girls of seventeen are apt to view age-thirty-forty- seemed a great way off to me; well, she was very beauti- ful-too beautiful to die, and then I felt sorry for Johr- again, and had so many wild conjectures flitting through my brain while looking, that twilight crept in and filled   ATHOL.         281 the room before I was at all aware of it; and then as I heard the wheels of the doctor's gig creeping up the road, I pushed back the picture into its place, shut and locked the desk, and turning the key in the door as John had bade me, went out to meet Harrie, and tell her very cool- ly ("John had gone away." "Away?" she cried in astonishment, " and without a word for me?" "He will only stay a little while," I explained, " and I have. been magnanimous enough to put your cares, ac- counts, etc., on my shoulders." "And you are a dear creature, after all," she said, " but you know the doctor and I are very practical, and go on the thorough Barkis' plan, as I always said I should. So you need not feel I should die if I had anything else to do but ride around and have a nice time with him. But come, we'll go down to Alice's-and take tea ; after which they shall come up here and stay ith us. I don't like being alone with only servants, do you?" Indeed I did not; so we went down to the rectory, and Guy and Alice came home with us, as Harrie said they should, and we had something very nearly like a pleasant evening again, and when it was ended, and I alone in my own room, I sat down and wrote Geoffrey a long, long letter. He never got it, poor boy, for that was the night our troops marched on Manasses; but I have always been glad that I wrote just the letter I did. It might not have been any comfort to him, and yet I wish so much he might only have read it early that next morning before the bat- tle begun.' Ten years ago-ten years ago-and even now, poor Geof, I wish he might have got that letter.     382         ATHOL.  CHAPTER XXI. THE twenty-first of July. What a bright, still, hot daby it was! The sun burst upon us clear and strong in the   early morning, with never a cloud in the sky, and yet what a dark, dark page in history is written of that day! Never- since America first called herself free had such a wild, woeful day dawned for her as that memorable twenty-firs:  of July, which ushered in the bloody battle of Bull Run. As we look back-already through the mist of years, though it seems to me it were only yesterday, so freshly does everything come up before me-a thrill of horror is our sole emotion. Remember, this was our first great throw. We had staked our all on that battle. Defeat was almost death to hope as well as life, but we did not any of us dream of defeat! It was a game of skill, not of chance! And had not the great North risen in heir -strength? This impending .battle would settle the quer- tion at once, people said. It was not strange, then, I w/s firm in the faith too. Alas! what foolish dreamers we were all, and how God called -that day and waked us out of sleep. That morning when the papers were brought in we knew the army was marching-that even then the conflict was begun.     -               "We shall sing the song of Miriam to-night, Hal," I said, as I laid down the paper, after reading it over, as we always did at breakfast. "Don't jest," said Alice, looking up quickly. "Only think of the horror of the day down there."   ATHOL.         283 And she opened the window and looked out, so peace- ful and still it was, with the careless sunbeams flitting through the trees, and the birds singing overhead, as if there were (" no death in life," while " down there," as Alice said, under the hot Southern sky, we, knew the air was heavy and dim with battle smoke, and screaming shot and shell, and tramp of armed men, and clash of sword and bayonet-all under that same peaceful, blue sky. How strange and hard to understand! But then we were to come off conquerors, and it was worth the agony. Was it? Harrie came up and put her arm around me as I stood there. "If only our friends are safe to-day," she whispered. I turned and closed the window. I would not listen to Alice, who was wondering " if in this world anything could ever be safely, called ours."' I would not let my heart be sad. "What would I do?"I had asked of Geof- rey, and how well'I remembered his answer. "Why, you must encourage mfe--a wife, you know." Yes, I knew, and sad I would not be to-day; but it was hard, all the same, to hush my heart into silent, passive waiting for news. I would read; so I took my book after luncheon and went out in the little summer house, under the cool shade of the trees, and took up the ta'le again--"Maud," it was-I would just finish it to-day, in spite of John. Mother Goose indeed! and I was glad that, like Maud, I "could come into the garden " this bright, beautiful day, with never a cloud overhead-never a-cloud! Everything was so still that all I could hear was the faint little stir of the trees, and a bee humming in the vine over my head; and while I sat there half-drowsily- reading, strangely blending with the poem, came over and over again the one dream of all young girls' lives-the dream which would one day become reality and make me Geoffrey's wife! Very strange it seemed-very unreal. But I would     I 284         ArHOL.  be happy, yes, very happy. And the bee went on hut-    ming, and the trees softly stirring, while I dreamed my  dream, rousing for an instant when I heard the garden   gate swing to, and hasty steps coming up the walk. jI  went out to the door and met Dr. Truman face to face. - He was pale, he did not speak. "'The poor doctor,' I   thought, " was he sorry for the South to-day after all," add d I opened my mouth to say something jestingly, but   i stopped; his look, his manner, forced a terrible suspicion ? on my heart. But he only took my hand and led me bWck j: to my seat, putting his arm about me as if to shield me  from some cruel blow. - Only for a moment was I silent,   then my white lips framed the question-    J "You have something to tell me? Tell me at once. I can bear anything better than suspe nsen. "      . I thought I was brave and firm, but a great awe, and j trembling fell upon me as I looked in the doctor's eyes ? and saw heavy tears gathering there.           "They met at Bull Run, you know. You saw the paper this morning?" /Yes, yes." "They fought; and we are defeated, disheartened,  ' drehoalized-lost, lost, child!"           ! And then, as if dreading to say more, he tried to speak but could not, and broke down in articulate sobbing.   "I will not believe it," I said, a sudden enthusiasm B and courage flashing through me like electric fire. " you were never on our side. I will not believe it-I will 'not believe it from you!" ,  The doctor groaned. "I have not told you all, my child. In pity I withheld the worst," and he drewin his breath like a sob. "Geoffrey," I said, "tell me, he is safe?"    i! "Safe indeed!" and his lips quivered as he held out both arms to take me in.   ATHOL.         285 I sprang into them. "Tell me quickly," I entreated, " quickly, or I shall die. You said he was safe--" "And he is," he said solemnly. "Safe with the God whom he adored-dying as he would wish to die-caught up into heaven, as it were, like the prophet of old, in a chariot of fire. Oh! my child, he was indeed a fair young Itartyr, a very Stephen." I staggered out of the doctor's pitying arms, and sat down on the garden bench. The hot July sun poured down upon us over the tall old trees, still, burning and terrible. But for me it shone none at all. All the fair blue sky, the whispering trees, and humming, busy bee, were suddenly blotted out and steeped in the blackness of night. For one moment it seemed as if my heart stood still, the shock was so great, so unlooked-for. It had never occurred to me that this strong life could be quenched so suddenly. Death came to my mind by slow degrees-long, wearisome torture-not such a sudden snatching away of life, and youth, and brightness. It was an instant of strange, conscious revelation to me-a flash-'in which I saw for the first time how swiftly and remorselessly the ar- row had sped. In that one moment, it seemed to me, years had rolled over my head, and a new, awful experience of life had been purchased in that pang. I clutched at the empty air with- outstretched hands, with a wild, unutterable long- ing for that which I knew was dead to me beyond a hope of recall. Oh!- if I might only have said one little word to him before he had been caught up out of my sight for- ever. You who have passed through that bitter agony; you who lost your all in that fierce conflict of '6i; you, and only you, can go with me through this, my Gethse- mane; and you, who knew no loss, thank God abundantly that you were spared the anguish. I had sat down so calmly and blindly, even this morn- \      Z86  -       ATHOL.  ing, jesting carelessly with Harrie over the news the    night would bring, thinking of nothing but the great victory which was to be purchased by blood--but not my blood-  no woman thought that. Each sighed for the other with a sense of humanity and womanly tenderness in her heart,  but each one thought her own exempt. Her own-Gcd would spare her that! But many a heart that bitter sun-  mer day felt that indeed God's ways were not our ways. Many a hart felt the mocking summer sunshine as if it were a heaviness and a cloud instead of a glory. I almost Xj: wondered it could shine on hearts that had nothing to re- - joice in-it seems such a mockery that in our distress  ! earth can be so gay.                   I  "Oh! sunlight, go up higher! in the blue-  With harp and crown and white robe-close by Him Thy master, thou wilt find a glad And new, young cherubim." For me, I said something inarticulately, as a woman wi:l, of the glory of the dead, in the first flush of her patriotism and despair, vainly seeking comfort in the former. I did not-look at the doctor's white face or tearful eyes. I sad f some vague words, without being at all aware of what I was saying, and went on toward the house with a sudden sense of chill and want confronting my changed life. And I staggered on in the sudden darkness, which had blinded my sight, with only a dead, white face ever before me, and staring, blank, blue eyes-a dead, white face, set in its frame of tossed and golden hair-and lips closed and silenced-lips that would never more press mine, cr call me that name above all others at which I tremble4, when it fell with such tender solemnity from Geoffrey s  lips-never-his wife. The doctor would have put his arm about me, but threw off his support. l   ATHOL.         287 "I can walk alone," I said fiercely. "Grief does not kill a woman, and it was the death above all others'he longed to die," and I threw up my head with the vain at- tempt to rid myself of that staring, white face which was interposing itself between me and the darkening sky; as if, from out its depths, the face of him who loved me so well had put aside the curtain to gaze at me from those distant heights. "It is not Geoffrey," I said, smiling and looking up. "He was too orthodox and well anchored in his faith to believe in such translation," and I remembered the time past when he, as teacher, and I, as scholar, had read from the little well-worn pocket Testament the words, to me so incomprehensible and mysterious, 'For David is not ascended into the heavens,' and I had asked, wonder- ingly, 'Where was David that thousand years?' And he had explained, in his high church pride, that since Christ had gone before into that mysterious intermediate state I all others were lying there until the last great day, when  they should start into life and see the wonder and glory of the new Jerusalem, coming out of heaven adorned as a bride for her husband." "My child," said the doctor, for I must have spoken aloud, " this has been too much for you-you must let me help you-you must come with me," and he drew me into the house; but, without a thought for anybody in the world, only that dead face of ghastly inquiry meeting mine, I stood still. I could not bear to go in and feel I was shutting Geof- frey away from me. I opened the door and went back into the broad, glaring sunlight, and waved ny hand to the face that I saw still parting the fleecy cloud and looking into mine with such yearning. "I will be true to you, Geoffrey," I said. "I will be worthy such a life and such a death." And to my dis-     288         ATHOL.  ordered fancy the blank eyes lighted, and a smile broke over the face. I saw it as plainly, as vividly as if it were absolute presence.                  ! "I will tell you now that I love you," I whispered, as { if from the heights which he had gained he could hear gj me. "I will tell you now that I love you," and then a 8. mist stole over the-face, and a soft cloud wrapping it up, 3 bore it away; but I kept on repeating it over and over, as  if he would hear me.        : "Come in," said the doctor sternly, and he put his S arm about me and drew me into the dark, cool house   : again. "You shall not stand there muttering such gib- X berish, when our hearts are all breaking as well as yours. t I loved him, too, child-who did not?"And he buried ? his face in his hands in a burst of sorrow he did not think himself less manly for feeling. I did not shed a tear, but my mind had been fright- fully taxed. My senses were reeling, and strange, wicked thoughts were forcing themselves on my brain, and in the great darkness, which had suddenly overpowered ie, a dumb remonstrance arose. Why was it so? Life was made up of partings, I knew. I, myself, had stood all my life, until lately, alone. Father, mother, both gone before, and now, when for the first time a home and love were mine, I too must be made to feel this bitterness which outlives even love-the bitterness of death. Why did God allow it? Were we wrong here at the North, after  all? Was the doctor right when he said "God would send a swift and sure retribution?"What had they done? Did it go back farther than the sins of the fathers, which should be visited on the children? Had there indeed been evil wrought in the land that good might come? Was it right that men should sit tamely under the shadow of a great and hideous wrong, or were we punished for sitting silently so long? It- was a dark labyrinth of doubts :o    ATHOL.          289 wade through-doubts that went back farther than the "Missouri Compromise" or the Nebraska Bill. "And Mr. Thorn?"I questioned. "God never takes such men," said the doctor bitterly, with a sense of wrong in the bitterness. "It is only the fair and good who are worthy the imartyr's palm.'" It was hard. A man in the hey-day of life and love; around whose future not a shadow could seem to fall; a future that had stretched itself before us both, fair, im- possible and bewildering, suddenly swept into night; and the other, alive and well, not needed in this world, weak and useless, as far as strength of arm and mind went. It was a horribly unjust world-a 'bitter, remorseless fate. Why should Geoffrey's life be broken off so suddenly, and Mr. Thorn's---about whom nobody cared, and who was of no actual importance to the world, or the world to him, for that matter-go on? He would never be a man, like Geoffrey. He would never be so noble a defender of the right-and then I was suddenly smitten with remorse when I remembered the whispered words I had heard one night, "I want to do something in the world yet, if it's not too late-something worthy my country and you, my friend." Yes, he was Geof's friend. He was grieving, too. But for all that my heart. persistently asked, Why was it so? It is so impossible to feel that at all times "God's greatness flows around our incompleteness "-Oh! for his rest around my restlessness. For this I prayed, and then later, when somewhat calmer in my grief, I began to doubt-sometimes such reports were wrong--even the doctor admitted it-he might be wounded-dying-oh! if I could only go to him, and whisper out all my sorrow, remorse, and repentance. But the next telegram settled our doubts into awful- certainty; The day was lost, and many and many a fair young life with it. But there was 13     29o         A'THOL. -: no despair! iThank God, for that! only a passionate hushi- ing of sorrow, and a new consecration of husband,  fathers and sons-a sacrifice as great to each heart As i the sacrifice of old which took the only and well beloved Isaac-only alas! no saving arm interposed, and many a  heart bled on in silent desolate anguish, alone. Two days after, a detachment of Geoffrey's regiment, g Mr. Thorn among them, brought their young commander r homre-and then came the burial-oh! saddest and moqt : hopeless of all things, to consign-to the dark earth this ! body which we have loved-to shut it away from sigh-,  } for evermore. In my memory that day is to me, forevei, jfi a sealed book! a book never more to be opened, with the  pall of a silence and horror resting on it, never to bpe  taken away. I would not see him' buried-I would not go to the, church-I would not even trust myself to see his dead, white face--I would only remember'him as I saw him that last day at the camp, looking down at me with his  careless, happy smile, and the look of immortality in his clear eyes, which I could not understand-the sunligh: touching the fair, ambrosial curls, the wind just tossing them in light and shade. I stayed alone in John's dark+ ened and closed library, while all the rest left me, to dc honor to the heroic dead. I sat there with -a blank, dul sense of misery at my heart, for which I was totally un- prepared. I could not weep at Guy's kindly and well meant words of consolation, o r Harrie's open grief and sympathy. Only, when little Lizzie Marshton put her' arms around me in a passionate, childlike burst of sorrow,I I roused for a moment to soothe her grief. "Oh! if I only knew," she sobbed, " if he were safe!--  so good, so true and pure he was--oh! can he be any- where else, my darling Geof-anywhere else, but safe in, Heaven?"  ;    ATHOL.          29I Poor, little, doubting heart'! strong in its love, but firm in its faith. If indeed he were a heretic where could she gain comfort and strength? something in her hope- less sorrow touched me more than all else. "If I only felt sure," she said, '"I would not grieve." "Hush "I interrupted, "Lizzie, I cannot hear that. The heavens were ready for Geoffrey, as for Stephen- straight fromn the battle-field to a martyr's crown; up from the war and conflict to the calm beyond; from the pain and death-agony, to the quiet and rest of the ever- lasting arms. I cannot think of anything else for him." She put her tear-stained face against mine and whis- pered : "I will stay with you, if you will let me-I cannot go down there, and see him put away from sight forever." "No," I would not let her stay, I only begged to be alone, and she kissed me, saying through' her tears, "I will go and pray, Athol, for him, for you, and for us all," and she left me, to ask for that repose and peace which God had already given to his beloved as " sleep." I could not mingle my prayers with hers-not for the dead; only the living-and I took my Prayer Book with me, up on the hillock-the old Indian mound back of the house-and sat there in the bright sunlight, watching the slow procession wind along the road; saw the gay trap- pings of the soldiers, who marched before the hearse black and solemn with nodding plumes, and dimly through my tears the flag wrapping the coffin--the flag he loved so well, and died to save. Have you ever found any consolation in that thought, oh! mourner, like me?--his cap, sword and belt rested on it, and on each side walked four young soldiers with uncovered and bent heads. I could not see their faces; it was too far away, but Mr. Thorn was among them I knew-poor Mr. Thorn. Then, led by his servant, followed his horse gayly caparisoned-     292         ATHOL.

I looked and listened with a stupefied fascina-  tion; and the wind in the pines above me whispered  i dreary dirges, keeping time to the wailing melody below. A And above it all the muffled tolling of the bell, and the slow rumbling of the carriages.            ; A funeral is sad enough at any time, but known and X beloved as Geoffrey was by all, and the first of their num- i ber to die for the great, new cause, there could not id possibly have been a sadder assembling of those who had gathered together, to pay their last tribute of respect and ii affection to him for whom they mourned indeed. And  then as they wound down the hillside toward the little  chapel, I opened my Prayer Book, following Guy through all the beautiful, solemn burial service, and I wept and sob- bed over the words, "Forasmuch as it hath pleased  J Almighty God, in His wise Providence, to take out of the H world the soul of our deceased brother--" as if my heart were breaking. Was it a wise Providence? Did it please God? then back came the old, wicked, rebellious  reasoning:  "Why was it so?" and then I turned to the beautiful comforting Psalm preceding that prayer, reading it over and over again, until it calmed me like a, spell, lingering in my heart long after I had finished it, I like the presence of player. How still it was up there 1  on the old hillock, under the pines, with their murmuring, swaying branches, gently lulling me with soothing sound;  like a mother hushing her baby to sleep, so those dark, old trees swung their tassels to and fro, softly singing to me!         - "And this was life?"I said to myself sitting there silent and alone; the life I had come out to meet with  such a bounding heart only a year before. Very little I - t             ; ;i -           ATHOL.      .   293 knew then -of the two great. realities, Life and Death. I had said boastingly (, The world was a Paradise and Life a perpetual draught from a cup overflowing with sweets!" and instead what a great, ghastly, funeral pageant it was- a prison-a charnel-house, in which we struggled' and fretted our brief time away, longing uncertainly for the veil to be lifted, to tplace our feet upon the Everlasting hills, to see from beyond, the still, calm, boundless Eter- nity floating there-oh! but to reach it-oh! but to van- ish, and be of it, and part of it-deep, unfathomable and boundless this Paradise of God would open for us in the great Hereafter. And as in a dream, I sat bewildered and awe-struck with the thought of the unutterable radi- ance and light beyond. Some one coming out of the house startled me; opening the garden gate and walking rapidly up the ter- "races, toward me. I turned and looked, quite still, and outwardly calm, but all my heart seemingly left me, to go out in welcome to the only person now in the wide wide world, whom I most longed to see. We had parted in anger, but I forgot it when he drew near, all the grave lines in his face were so softened into pity. I did not speak-I only went up to him in a dumb, quiet way, into his open arms, and laid m'y head wearily upon his shoulder. All the past was suddenly bridged over and forgotten-put away; he would not be unkind now in my sorrow--he would give me strength and sym- pathy instead; and the falling day grew suddenly bright- er with his presence. "Poor little Daisy," he said, "poor little birdie," and his eyes, full of kindness and compassion looked into mine. "I came as soon as I heard-" "Thank you for coming," and then suddenly holding out my hands to him, I sobbed brokenly. "( If you have ever loved me, John, and been a friend to me, come back     294.   .      ATHOL, to me now, and be that friend again. God knows I need you John-I cannot live without you." "My poor little Daisy," and he soothed me like a g child, as I lay upon his heart-his heart beating so calm  ly and evenly, whilst mine was almost breaking. "My  poor little Daisy,-you can tell me all your grief, and we M must comfort each other. I have my sorrow to bear, as  well as yours, child."             [ "I may speak to you," I said, " may I not, as to none I other? oh! John, how can I live without him? It is so ti dreadful to think him dead,"-shudderingly, " so dread-  ful to be alone."                  1 "I bear it, and live," he said in a low compressed [ voice, full of pain. Yes, poor John. I was selfish in my !; -sorrow, and thinking as each heart is apt to think With its own particular woe to wring it, "Was ever sorrow like I? unto my sorrow?"Poor John-and he had borne it all so silently. But then no remorse could mingle with his  grief-he had given love for love-and I?-and I did not wonder at his silence. What could he know of my self- reproach and inarticulate grief?  "I was never kind to him," I sobbed, repentantly-- "not even at the very last-and if I only had said one little word to him before he went away. He begged me so to tell him, but I never did--not once." "What was it you never told, Daisy?!" asked John in a low voice. ",I never told him that I loved him, though he asked me so many times. And now he will never know," I said brokenly. "You did not love him as you should, child, or you would have told him, and now, only time can help you," he said in a hard kind of way. "You think I will forget him?"I asked fiercely. "Time can never teach me that."   AXrHOL.         295 c"And I would not bid you forget him if I could," the pity coming back into his voice again, and time will teach you better than I can how-to outlive regret. But come down to the house, little Daisy-you must trust to me again-this time I will try and not be so hard a guar- dian-we will let bygones be bygones-come down with me."  "I cannot--I want to stay here-stay with me, please." "Daisy, child, I will stay with you, but not here. I expect you to leave this damp place, and come right down to the house with me-I shall stay at home, and take care of you now." He spoke kindly, but peremptorily, and I took his arm, swallowing my sobs, and clinging to- him in a weak, child- ish way, glad of his return, his protection, and his gentle authority as well. He did not say a word while we were walking down the garden walk, but when we came to the porch, lifted me in his arms and carried me up stairs, into my own room. It seemed ages since he had done that; and yet it was only a few months 'ago. . Truly, " we live in deeds, not years; in thoughts, not breaths; in feelings, not in figures on a dial;" and counting time by " heart throbs," it was a very, very long time since John had so tenderly cared for me. He laid me on the sofa, threw a light shawl over me and put the cushion under my head; but I only turned to the wall, burying my face in the silken pillow, and crying bitterly. At this, John sat down by my side. "Do not cry so, Daisy," he said, " do not cry so, my child." And he put his arm about me, and whispered all his own sorrow and loss, and we tried each to comfort the other, and because I felt he was near me, and because he was kind again, and had put his arm about me in the old, protecting way, I could only cry more bitterly than ever.     296         ATHOL.  And then I whispered, leaning my head against his shoul- der, "Do not be angry with me any more-I have no one  now but you-do not cast me off again." And he held  me closely to him, answering not a word, but I knew in- I / stinctively that all the past was put away, and he would  never be unkind or cold again. And then lying there, I heard from him, that which no one else had yet told me; i of that mad, wild charge, in which Geoffrey was last seen; waving his sword and cheering on his men, his  : voice, cool and courageous, enforcing command, and im- i parting enthusiasm.            "He had done the work of a dozen men," Mr. Thorn  said, that day: everywhere in the thickest of the fight,  with his uniform soiled and torn, his cap gone, his fair hair tangled and tossed, grim with battle smoke and blood, but with eyes always full of their old brightness, and the same cool, careless smile on his face, he had fol- lowed him with a sort of fascination, longing to share his  danger. Keeping up with him, watching him closely, through some wild instinct he could not shake off, until suddenly he saw him spring forward, then fall--but the tide of battle swept on, and he was borne with it, and saw him no more until the conflict was over, and the lost day was ended; and then under cover of the kindly night he had found him, his fair handsome head gently lying as it had fallen, with the same careless, easy smile on his face that death could not rob him of, and the tawny curls damp with the dews of night. I could hear it all calmly as John told it to me there, pitifully, tenderly, in the dying day; while all the time the breezes bore to my ear the sobbing, wailing dirge of the music in the valley below, and then I heard the long, con- tinuous roll of the muskets, and I knew they had buried him forever from my sight in the pleasant shade of the cemetery under the brooding hills, and again I said to my-   ATtHOL.         297 self with a sickening, hungry sense of want in my heart, "I will be true to you, Geoffrey," and close, and near and smiling seemed his face, and his whispered words repeated themselves over and over again, "Don't indulge in false sentiment, my darling." Ah! Geoffrey, how often those words sounded in my ear; even that first, sad night of your coming back and going to rest under the shade of the dim, old trees of home. CHAPTER XXII. THE days passed by after this all alike. It made no difference to me who was displaced, or placed in com- mand of the army. The roar of battle waxed stronger and fiercer day by day, and only one cry went up over the land," Rachel mourning for her children, and refusing to be comforted because they were not." I woke from my apathy sometimes to ask over again the one question of my heart. "Why? why was it so?" I looked over the long lists of dead and dying which filled the papers, and wondered in a bewildered way when it would end, and how long men could go on murdering each other in this way. Stronger faith than mine grew weak-and wavering in that time of doubt and darkness- doubt almost of the justice of that God who from the dawn of time it was said was the God of the oppressed, the defender of the right. It was a baffling mystery, and men sought eagerly for the clue which would lead ihem to reason and clear comprehension. It was groping blindfolded and in the dark for many a long, weary month, but we found it out at last. And all the time fiercer and wilder surged the tide of war; sometimes we were victo- i3*     298         ATHOL. rious, sometimes defeated. What did it matter? We only died any way--jtt as well to die so, perhaps, as calmly in one's bed at honme-it all ended the same.  Day after day I used to sit by' my window, from which  I could overlook the whole valley, and watch the flag wav- l ing over Geoffrey's grave. No monument or stone had  X been placed there as yet, and in their sad pride his friends  had marked the spot thus. People loved to display their  loyalty in this way, and wherever there was a place to put  it, we found it floating. I was glad. It was a fit monu-  ment. I wished it might never be taken away. Any time  of day, or night even, I could see the tall staff piercing i the trees, and the flag slowly unfolding and spreading with  every breeze. It almost seemed to me that Geoffrey's sleep was more peaceful under its broad, free folds, as if  he were happier for its nearness.  What foolish dreamers we are! We plant flowers on graves, and send up towering marble shafts pointing to  heaven, and we tell the virtues of the dead on the fair, white stone, fancying with a tenderness we cannot pre- vent, and would not if we could, that the sleep of those beneath is all the sweeter for this careful tending; and we almost forget the immortal flowers that are springing up along their higher path, at whose brightness our poor flowers fade and grow dim. Paradise-that is the word- if indeed Paradise has opened for them, what matter where they lay, or if their graves be adorned or neglected? What matter indeed-and yet we love to dream our little dreams. I dreamed mine; and the summer waned, the conflict spread and deepened, and John still lingered with us at home, restless, unhappy, but for all that his presence made' us glad; and Time, the great all-healer, softened our sorrow and gave us rest as the days went by. I can- not begin to tell how good and kind-all the family were to me. Guy was always a dear brother, even before this   ATHOL.          299 loss in our midst; but now he was more than ever kind, and Alice and Harrie were sisters indeed to me. As for John, there seemed to be a tacit understanding between us, that all the past was ended, and I was again near to his heart. He was graver, sadder than of old, but never unkind; always tender and loving, but sad, even morbid in his settled melancholy. His was not a nature to forget suddenly; but he never spoke of sister, never went to her room, never that I know of went to her grave, but he car- ried the loss in his heart, bearing it as he bore all else, silently and alone. Slowly, very slowly, something of his old manner to me returned. I was again "Daisy" and "my child" to him again - alas! poor Geoffrey - again I was almost happy, and strange to say I was sorry for it. I did not want to let my grief die such a very tranquil death, like all great emotions after a time must die. It somehow disgusted me with life that every thing was going on just as before-that the number of souls going out to God suddenly, were marked by the flash of the guns down South-a great and illimitable host, a Vast, silent army- and yet the sun shone, the birds sang, and the earth was green, and men calmly read over the long lists of dying or dead each day in the papers, and went on living their lit- tle life out just the same. Why, even up here among the quiet hills we were having ghastly work with wounded, or sick and suffering soldiers. Every time the cars came in some poor wreck of humanity was left to-be cared for, or given the "cup of cold water " which none could refuse to give. I went among them. I helped them. I worked for them, but I felt indignant with myself that I could go about it so calmly. I strove again and again to go over the agony of that bitter day in July, after the Bull Run battle, but the first great shock was over, and I knew al- most at the time I would get over it. Everybody did- i      300         ATHOL. why should not I? And with a feeling as of doing the  dead a wrong, I hugged my sorrow closer to my heart, but ' in vain; my grief had exhausted itself, and in its place - there was only a dumb bewilderment and a silence laid upon me. To Harrie and the doctor I could talk, but Mr.  Thorn I would not see, when he came up to say good.  bye and leave me a few little tokens, the pocket Testa-  ment among them, which was with Geoffrey when death met him. He was going back to the army to fight it out, Would I not see him once before he left?" he asked. I knew it was hard, but I could not. "Say good-bye to him for me, Hal," I said; "but really I want to be alone." And so with our friends. People came every day to pay me visits of sympathy. All hearts mourned him," they said. What did I care for sympathy? What good would it do me? No, no, of all horrible mockery these visits of condolence are the most torturing. No human being shall ever console me. If my God fail me at time of, awful trial, no mortal shall essay the task. And so,j quietly and alone, that peace, which comes in time to even/ the most worn and aching heart, came back into mine, and after that first bitter moment, I only thought of Geof4 fiey as where he would be. His face no longer appeared to me in the mists of the far-away heaven. It seemed near and smiling, as of old. It seemed to say to me all the time, as he said that one day to me in the stillness of the Berkshire woods, up on the hill, "Don't indulge in false sentiment, my darling. Love mne while I am here, and think of me at my best when I am gone. There is not, thank God, any marriage or giving in marriage in the heaven of our hopes, and my little darling must take her life and happiness as the Giver of good will send them to her." These were the words which came to my heart oftener than any other. The dead face looked at me no more from the parted cloud. I had never seen it since I   ATHOL.          301 whispered, in the foolish and wild ignorance of my fancy, all the love I would not tell it in its lifetime; and, as if, content with the assurance, alas! come too late, it had withdrawn itself and I saw it no more. Never again- never again-fainter and fainter like a fading photograph it grew, until out of my young life the vision passed like a dream. It was even as he had wished. It was God's gracious goodness and healing time which touches lightly those griefs which at some period of our lives we say to ourselves will always be kept green. We may reiterate it again and again, but the days go by, and life and strength come back, and we live our little life out in spite of griefs, which when looking at them separate and unknown we feel are insupportable. The simple truth is we do not know ourselves, and it is well. The invisible fingers of Time and Fate are directed by a great unseen power, a power we dimly recognize and imperfectly adore; a power which we poor finite creatures of a day cannot compre- hend with our feeble minds, but, sometime in the great, uncertain future-" as a dream when one awaketh," we shall be able to know and understand. The summer passed, and was gone. The flowers drooped and faded on sister's and Geoffrey's graves, and the flag unfolded itself no more over his quiet resting- place. A fair, white cross marked the spot, and the sim- ple story of his death was told on the tablet at the foot. How strange it seemed to me! - Last year at this time the thread of my life was running evenly and far apart from his," I thought. Then how soon they became en- tangled, blending in one, and how fair a future we had built up for ourselves out of empty air, and now, this was all that was left, a mound and a cross, and the thread of my life was running on again, alone-a mound and a cross, around which Harrie and I would hang flowers, and every Sunday after service reverently visit, talking sadly     302         ATHOL.  and tenderly of the dead. What strange things m de up our lives, and yet to me Geoffrey was never fully ded! I started sometimes at the sonund of a passing footfall, and  almost expected to see the- frank blue eyes and carel ss smile again. Poor old Nep, I think, shared my fancies,  too. He had been left with me when Geof broke up his  camp among the hills, and there was never an idling, whistling boy passing up the road that he did not start or  listen, or bound away suddenly, only to come back, look- ing wistfully up in my face as if he, too, felt the keen  pang of disappointment. Dear old Nep. He kept gravely by my side, and wherever I went followed me about, just as he had used to do his master. And sum- mer was gone, the flowers had bloomed for the last time, and the trees were all aflame with scarlet and gold, and the hills one waving line of glory. The Marshtons shut up their stately home and went abroad. I only saw Liz- zie, and said good-bye to her. I thought I should always love little Lizzie and be glad to welcome her back-Geof's favorite cousin. I was sorry to have her go. As for Georgie, I could not tell whether my guardian was glad or sorry when she was gone. He seemed as indifferent to her departure as to all else. Harrie and I went on very quietly through the fall and winter with our German, goirig down to the rectory, as usual, and seeing no one, aside from the family, but the doctor. It was a quiet, quiet winter, but not sad to me, for all I was very much alone. German twice a week, and the doctor-every day, engross- ing very nearly all of Harrie's valuable time. So it naturally befell that I took her. place in John's study, and did all the writing and copying which had heretofore fallen to her lot. He was always kind to me. I do not think that whole winter we had asingle argument. I am very cer- tain I did nothing to displease him, although he rarely indulged in a caressing word; but I knew by the grave     ATHOL.         303 smile that he always gave me I was a help and comfort to him, and I could not be lonely or sad any more. But with a remorseful feeling of doing Geoffrey a wrong, I would not give myself up wholly to my old, unlimited girlish happiness. If I did not, in the deepest depths of my heart, yet mourn with a bitter, unavailing cry the memory of my young hero lover, I would be, before the world and at home, true to the martyred dead. But I grew restless under my self-imposed restraint, and the consciousness that although I was refraining from society and pleasure, it was more because of what the world would say than any positive shrinking on my own part to take up the world again. I would be ashamed to confess this, even to this fair white page, were I the only instance on record of such forgetfulness; but alas! I was only a woman-a young and inexperienced one. I could not unmake myself or be different from the rest of the world -do not condemn me. Gradually old thoughts, put by with a will once, now loosed of their check, came back into my heart. I had never, since the night I had so resolved, asked myself any useless questions. Geoffrey was all that was worthy any woman's love, and I had given myself to him. Had he lived my life would have been tranquil and happy; but he was gone, and it was vain to keep his loss forever green in my memory, saying over and over fiercely to my- self it should always be, for even while I was saying it the chains of an older and stronger passion were binding me unconsciously more closely than before. I found it out, when John said to us one day at table, very abruptly, he was going away. I did not ask where, but all the world slipped suddenly like a blank before me. What were home, friends, even life without him? I looked up quickly in his face, a mute question, "Where?" in my eyes. He understood it.     304         ATHOL. "Anywhere-out of the world, I wish-into the d rk,"  under his breath. "It will not always be dark," I said. "Somewhere, for  every soul, lies a strip of blue sky and a little light--if it  is only a glimmer, it will point the way ahead," Ifsaid, al- most in a whisper. "Why need you go? you can lfind I the light here as well."              f: He pushed me from hin.  "It has been a will-o'-the-wisp too long for me to trust it now," and  there  was a stab  in  his words as he Went away. That night while I sat alone, feeling almost lost ir the solitude and gloom of the great drawing-room, H rrie came in to find me. She walked up to my chair, leaning over the back of it, and looking down at me with a bright, happy smile said, "Well?" as if she ouly waited to be questioned to unfold a budget of very pleasant thoughts. "Where is ' Barkis'?"I asked, for a beginning. "Gone off over the hills to see a sick woman, an flour or more ago, and I have been sitting over the dining-room grate all of that time alone. What did you run away for?" "I thought you would rather have me away." "Nonsense-and you were lonely too, I know. Wlhere is John?" "I haven't seen him since dinner." e    "Athol, I'll tell you what," she said, after indulging in a most unromantic yawn, "John is going away. Di n't you hear what he said to-night. He will probably go abroad.                    t "Yes," I said. "The Marshtons are in Paris," with a jealous quickness discerning his motive for 1eav- ing us. "Very true, but I hardly think that alone influences him. Beside he abhors Paris, and the Marshtons are to be there the remainder of the winter. Very likely he'll   -I           ATHOL.         305 not go- near them. He. has not cared anything for Georgie latterly. He is simply unhappy, Athol. He has grown more morbid than ever since dear sister's death- sometimes I wonder he does not join our army." "Horrible!"I interrupted, shocked at her calm tone, "as if this fearful war had not brought us trouble enough without wishing for more." "Indeed you misunderstood me," she answered, a grave shadow clouding her face for an instant. "It has indeed brought us trouble enough, and I would deplore his going as much as you. I only say it is a wonder with his reckless regard of life, and his very ultra notions politically, that he does not go at once. You will remem- her his views on the subject, I am sure." "But sister made him promise he would not go." "While she lived," Harrie added. Then after a mo- ment's pause, " only a year ago, how happy we all were- sister and Geof both with us! Oh, Athol, it does not seem possible. What a very strange, hard thing life is after all!" "If you can say that, Harrie, how do you think I can regard it? You have some one to protect you and be nearer and dearer than all beside. But when Geof- frey and sister died, it left me more utterly alone than ever I was before coming to you." And I broke down entire- :   ly in a passionate burst of crying. "My dear Athol-my dear little sister, look up," and both her arms were about me in a moment. "I have been very selfish I know. I have neglected you lately. Can you forgive me?" she whispered. "I felt 1 had not been kind while I was sitting there over the fire alone, and I came here just to have a good long talk with you. Do not cry any more," and :she would not allow me the comfort of tears, but began un- folding her plans this wise. "It was very clear," she said,     306         ATHOL. "that John would go away. She could not imagine-why he had remained at home so long. There was some reason which she could not fathom, but he was going now," and then she said, "Athol, here we are, two girls alone in this great, gloomy house. The doctor insists it is quiite time I should begin to honor and obey. The first act of obedience he will claim, is for me to leave the dear 0old  roof-tree and go down to his home. You know, just as well as I, Athol, it will be impossible for you to go on living here alone. It would be equally impossible for the  doctor to transfer office and interests to this place, so there's but one alternative. You must come with me."  "Thank you," I said, choking down a sob, "but there is no proper place positively for a third fiddle--:' "-de-dee," she put in indignantly. "Aren't ypu ashamed of yourself, Atholinda Derwent, and you kno6w I'm in dead earnest when I consent to give you your proper title. The fact is, we have talked it all over, and therels no use of your uttering a dissent. The matter is settled, and it only remains to get John's consent, a  wedding ring, and a proper gown I suppose, and off twe flit to the village."  She spoke as complacently of going to his home as if it were a palace, and it was nothing but the plainest of plain, low, rambling, white, wooden dwellings; not at all small or mean, but to me utterly cheerless and old- fashioned, with its high stoop and big brass knocker, a id white staring front, and its long stretch of real Yankele, "door yard," and its interminable, prim row of poplars bordering the fence. He had lived there with his mother until her death, and now there was only the old house- keeper and solitary man-servant about the place. ,Harrie Graeme would have much to do to make a home down there tolerable, I thought, and I? oh! I should die. Even the rectory, as John had once suggested, would be better   ATHOL.          307 than that, so I sat silent, with never a word for answer to all this. Ungracious, I suppose,but I did not care. What an utter breaking up of this happy, happy home, what a cheer- less, hopeless future, to put before me, and I sat shedding the bitterest tears in silence, while Harrie waited long and patiently for my reply. Finally her arm stole around my neck again. "Be a darling," she said, "be reasonable. We are sisters, if not in very truth we are in affection, and what place more proper for you than with me? so near Alice too; and in time, when John has grown too old to wander off this way, he will come back, and we shall all be to- gether again. Not as before," she said soberly," that I feel, but our losses will in time be easier to bear than now, and we have a long life of happiness before us I hope- do, Athol, try and be happy with me. If I could only do anything to make you feel as I do." Yes, she was happy. Every action and thought show- ed it, and if the doctor were Aladdin, and the old white homestead the famous palace builded in a night, roc's egg and all, I doubt if she could have been more entirely satisfied. It was torturing to see the smile of content on her face, while I was so wretchedly unhappy. I did not stay to hear more; I only pushed back my chair and ran out of the room, stumbling along in the dark, and blinded by my tears very nearly ran into John's arms as he opened the library door. He held me there, turning me to the bright light of the opened door-way and looking in my flushed, tear-stained face with surprised inquiry. Why do you cry, child? Has anything happened?" "Nothing," I said, forcing myself out of his arms. "It can be nothing new that I should be wretched and unhappy; and in the way-nobody cares for me, and I wish I were dead," I said in a perfect transport of indignant grief.     308         ATH-OL.  "Come in here and have a talk with me, Daisy. It  will do us both good."                 "No, I don't want to see even you, John, to-nigoht -" and I ran away from him, up to my own room, and threw myself in a perfect abandonment of tears on my bed. I  kept no note of time. I heard John calling Harrie, and then the doors closed and all was quiet and dark, and I lay on my bed quite still, crying passionately at first, then  slowly, with the apathy of exhausted grief. My head ached. My heavy eyes would close in spite of them- selves, and finally I fell asleep. I could not tell how long I had been lying there, when the door opened and Harrie entered. The room was quite dark, but I knew her steps. "In bed?" she asked, feeling her way to- ward me, and in her rapid sweep carrying table and books along with her, at the same time very nearly de- capitating me, as she sank down on the bed sayirg, coolly enough, "she hoped I was not asleep." . "You would waken the dead," I said, half crossly, feeling of my head and making sure all was right.  "Nonsense! Why isn't your lamp lighted then-this choosing 'darkness rather than light 'is against all Scrip- ture. But come, you embodiment of ingratitude, dry your tears. You will not live with me this year! The bans are forbidden! I just wish we could see the doctor's face when John breaks the news to him. I think it would be worth seeing." And she laughed as if she were not It all an interested party. I sat up, staring at her in the darkness, and asking: "You are not to be married after all, Hal?" "Not this year, John says. He is going abroad, as told you he would. When he comes back he says will b soon enough. Heigo! I had very nearly made out m wedding list. I wish it were not dark so I could make out whether you are laughing or crying, you spiteful little thing i -      I -   ATHOL.         309 "Both," I answered, putting my arms around her. "Oh! Hal, are you very much disappointed." I can't say I am," very coolly. "It isn't my fashion to be wretched over anything. For my part, I think half the world infinitely better off engaged than married. And now I'll light your lamp, and so be, sensible for the first time to-night, and go to bed." And she bustled about, setting my table and picling up my books,singing softly to herself, as she went back and forth from her room to mine, something about being ( ever with my Jean." "I should just like to see you wretched for a few min- utes, Hal," I said, looking after her and half laughing at the base idea, and then taking her advice and going very quietly to bed. CHAPTR XXIII. JOHN was going away Harrie had said, but he spoke nothing more about it to any of us, for three or four days ensuing. He had a great deal of writing apparently on hand, and seemed to be settling his affairs in a manner, so I was with him a-good part of my time, in the library, copying, writing, and putting away papers, but not a word did he say to me about going. He was very grave and quiet, staying as usual very much by himself, and only seeing the doctor to break to him the doleful news of Har- rie's remaining yet a little longer at home. That poor unhappy'swain was disgusted beyond degree with John's decided fiat, but it was no use indulging in argument. They had all their lives agreed to disagree, very pleas- antly, it is true, so it was hardly to be wondered at that '. . * t     3- IO        ATHOL.! John opposed him even in this. Harrie's spirits were n t in the least affected by it, and after a little natural des- : pondency on the doctor's part, things went on as evenl  as before.                - It was just about a week after that talk with Harris j which resulted in her postponed marriage, when, on6e  night after, writing for an hour or more after dinner, I laid X aside my pen and went up to the deep window, drawing  aside the curtain and sitting down there to wait for John; He had gone to the rectory to smoke his cigar with Guy, and I had been writing alone. The moon was just comr ing up through the trees, struggling through the leafless branches, and flooding the whole window with its pale soft light. Presently I saw him coming up the avenue, a long way off, for the trees were quite bare, even of'snow,spring slowly coming to us, although it yet seemed winter. I sat. watching for him and saw him long before he saw me. His hands were behind him, his head dropped forward and he came slowly along without looking up until he was very nearly at the porch. I tapped on the window, he- looked up, waved his hand, and came directly in to me, without stopping in the parlor where Harrie and the doc- tor were. "Alone, little one?" he asked, throwing hat and cloak after his usual fashion on the floor, and coming up to the window seat, where I was very nearly hidden by the curtain. "c Yes, and watching for you, John." He stooped down suddenly, smoothing my hair from my forehead, and kissed me abruptly.    i "It is so pleasant to have some one to watch for our coming--so pleasant that I am afraid to trust mys'elf here any longer. Do you know you are making it hard for me to go away, little Daisy?" "Then do not go," I said entreatingly, clasping his   ATHOL.         3" hand in mine. He half turned, as if he would leave, then sat down by my side. "I do not dare stay, child--I am wretched-I must get away." ("And make. us as wretched as yourself," I replied. ' That is the way with man. He only thinks of himself." "Indeed, little Daisy," he said, "I have not been thinking of myself at all for the last three or four months. I have been the most unselfish of mortals, if you only knew it."  X S I  "I should not have dreamed it. Pray, what great act of unselfishness have you been guilty of?" "In making up my mind so deliberately to go away, for one thing," he answered in a low, constrained voice. Then abruptly, "Do you not understand, child, how hard a thing it is to 'suffer and be strong'? To suffer on in silence is still more horrible." "That is one thing," I said, "which I wish I could understand--how suffering can make one strong. It makes me weak. I have no life, or strength, or hope, if I am sad. If I were unhappy long I should die." "Are you unhappy now, little Daisy?" "Not just this moment, perhaps," I answered truth- fully; " but after dinner I was just a little lonely and sad, so I came here to brave it out alone." "Were you crying?" "I don't know. I believe I was," I said weakly. "I cannot help it. If nothing else would make me sad, look- ing at the moon would.'  "Poor little Daisy." He put his hand down upon my face. Truly I had been crying-it was wet with tears. "Will you tell me what those tears meant, child?" he asked, drawing me very gently to his side, with some- thing of the old caressing tenderness in his voice again. i,      312         ATHOL. How long, how very long since he had spoken to me that way! My thoughts flew back instantly to the time-  the night I had promised to be Geoffrey's wife. That night he had kissed me, and held me close to his heart, and then cast me off. Would he do so again? "tYou do not give confession for confession, little Daisy," he said half jestingly. "And yet I told you why I had been unselfish. God knows if the path was dark L before it grows darker now."  I gave him an anxious, somewhat troubled look.  "I do not understand you," I said, stealing my hand into his. "I do not see why you need go away at all, or why you need be so unhappy." "Because," he said, averting his head, "I cannot trust myself to stay. You need not start. You will be bur- dened by no confidences-indeed I have nothing to tell, except I am a little in difficulty." V With whom?" "With myself," very gravely, his serious eyes looking full into mine. "I think I shall do better if I am quite alone for a little time. I shall go abroad." "The Marshtons are in Paris," I said with a flush of pique. "And I shall not go near Paris," with a quick gesture of disgust. "I shall go to England, and Scotland I fancy. I will go and see Elsie and Mr. Craigie. I think I should like to go over the same pleasant old path I took up the hill that first night you remember I found the little ' Red Riding Hood' in the gloamin' alone?" Could John remember it as distinctly as I did? That first night the happy future was spread before me, fair and bewildering. I had dreamed a great many dreams since then, but none more perfect or childlike than that which I lost myself in dreaming the first night of our meet ing up on the bleak Scotch hillside. i   ATHOL.         313 "You talk in enigmas," I said, looking up in his face wonderingly. "You do not go for pleasure, you acknowl- edge, you are giving yourself at well as us pain. Why will you leave us at all?" "You are judicious as usual," never noticing my ques- tion; "but you can no longer include Harrie in your sweep- ing assertions. Her life is completed if we are to judge by appearances." 'And mine, too, I sometimes fancy," I said half to myself. "At seventeen? Nothing to look forward to, Daisy? Nothing to hope in the future? Nothing stretching before you but a 'barren desert' of years? If at sev- enteen you can say this, how must life look from my stand- point, child? Truly a desert of years-a weary, unfruit- ful desert-a trackless waste, and I cannot discover the right path." He spoke gravely and sadly, and I knew some'good and important reason urged his leaving us; but all the same, I resolved I would try my best to keep him at home. "The right path is not over the sea," I said, looking' up in his face with an attempt at a smile. "You must urge me no more. You must be satisfied when I tell you it is duty only which compels me to go. If I leave you lonely, remember I am still more lonely. If you are wretched, child, measure your wretchedness by mine, and if it were tenfold greater than by any possi- bility it could be, mine would still far outweigh it. Know- ing this, you will not make it any harder for me to go than it is now." Not a word did I say in reply. "I shall miss my little assistant very much," he went on to say, trying to speak lightly. "I shall think of her very often and long to see her. I cannot begin to tell her how much."     i "     314      ATHOL.  The room was quite dark except for the moonbeams, and I sat where they did not touch me, so John could not see the tears which were filling my eyes, and which would start at the sound of his voice full of its old kindness. It was so long since he had talked to me this way, and now he was going to leave: as if life had not been hard and cruel enough to me lately without having him to make it harder. He should stay. "If you want to be alone, you can be so, John," I said suddenly. "Harrie and I will go away. We can go  to Alice, and you can stay here and never see us at all-  only we shall know you are near us," I whispered, leaning my head against his shoulder.  He held me closely to him for an instant. "You do not know what you ask, child," and his voice  sounded hoarse and strained. "You do not know your  power." "Have I power?"I said joyfully. "If so, I will test it, John. I do notmean you to go awayat all! Not even for a day," I added in a voice between triumph and plead- ing. "You shall not leave this room until you promise me!"  And I took both his hands in mine, laughing exult- ingly. But there was no answering smile. Whatever mo- tive had actuated him, he was in sober earnest about it. But I was persistent.  "I have been unhappy and lonely, and suffered as much as I suppose it is possible for one so young to suf- fer, and I will bear no fresh loss. I will have some little  stray joy in my path for the time to come. Do you not  know-surely you must know-that I have no one now  but you?" He looked as if he would interrupt me and speak,but instead he abruptly rose up, withdrawing my hands from  his, and walking away without a word, up and down with   ATHOL.         315 agitated steps. I did not follow him or speak again; of his own accord he came back to the window and stopped before me, bending down and looking at me with such a sorrowful face-such a handsome face it was, too, show- ing white in the moonlight in spite of its sorrowful, almost remorseful expression. "If only it were not you I should wrong, little Daisy, I would stay; but it is too hard-the little girl your mother trusted to me, and sister left me to care for-" and there was a sharp contraction of his face when he spoke of Grace. "Twice a legacy from the dead-oh-! if it were only some one else, little Daisy." )  What great wrong do you meditate, that you talk so strangely?"I asked in an utterly perplexed way. "Am I to keep my door bolted securely in the future, at night, lest I be strangled in my bed like the poor little princess in the Tower, or worse still, have my throat cut from ear to ear, which is much the more modern style of the two. On second thought I prefer strangling. I'am an arrant coward, and have a horror of butchery any way. By all means try the former." "What a child you are, Daisy," he interrupted hastily. "How can you jest? 1 was never farther from it inmy life." ( Because I cannot help it, John. Your very solemnity makes it the more laughable to me. Do be rational and never speak of wandering again. It was different when we were an unbroken family circle; but now we are so sadly separated-only three of us left here, and Harrie will not be with us for very much longer, and then-" "w hat then, indeed?" and moved by some strong emotion he took my hand in his, then dropped it as sud- denly, pushing me from him. "Do not tempt me thus," he said, turning away his eyes, "I cannot always answer for myself, Daisy. There are limits to even my self-subjection and control."     316         ATHOL.  I saw he was wavering. I knew he would yield. I  passed my arm within his and laid my head upon his shoulder, without a word. He tried to put me away.   i "Athol--Daisy, do you know what it is you want me to do? Do you know if I stay I shall be recreant to the i trust imposed in me, false to every feeling of duty and i honor, and trampling under foot every law of God and man--oh! do not ask me that way."       I  I saw he was suffering, and, with all that sympathy  that a strong man's emotion moves in woman, I tried to I i speak, but failed utterly, and could only sob inarticulately,  nestling closer to his side. He kissed away my tears. He hushed and soothed me like a child. "You shall have your way," he said. "I have been I cold and repelling, I have resisted all your affection and  sympathy, but I cannot resist your pleading anctdars,i. little Daisy. I will break my faith with the living as well as the dead. I will let it be said of John Groeme that he wilfully bartered the happiness of the child whom he was to protect and surround with happiness." "You are crazy, John!"I said, looking up and half i laughing through my tears. "The world will not give me the benefit of lunacy, j you will find; but I defy them all. Let those judge me  who may, I defy them."       .I "Do you mean you are not going away at all?" "i No more than you are going, cherie. You have  X begged me to stay, and I shall; but you are bound to mer fast, little one, by ties that shall not be broken; stronger than these, Daisy," and he touched my bracelet clasps, which had never been unloosed since the night he fastened them there. What did I care how strong the- bonds were that kept me to him? And I laughed with all the security of gratified power, never once caring for the   ATHOI.         317 broken faith and trust he had so bitterly deplored. I did not and would not understand him when he said he was doing me a wrong; yet, even in my joy, I could not fail to see the half-guilty, remorseful look which still dwelt upon his face, and which I could not entirely drive away. I put forth all my efforts to please him, and make him for- get the cloud which his own bitter fancies had created, and 1 partially succeeded. We did not light the study lamp. We just finished the evening there in the moonlight, his arm about me, and the old assured manner returned to us both. Not a word of the 1" bonds," which were to be stronger than clasps of gold, not a word of anything more than perfect friendship and good faith and comple understanding in the future. It was all I asked, desired- or thought of. When Harrie came in to find usg after the doctor had gone, I was surprised to learn the lateness of the hour. She looked quite jealous when I said with ready warmth, What a delightful evening we had passed; and when John put an arm around each of us, walking with us to the staircase, and kissing us both good-night as he used to do, she eyed him very keenly, uttering an emphatic "Non- sense!" as she went up before me. I could not sleep. A restless, excited feeling kept me awake long and long after Harrie had put out her light. I got up, threw a shawl about me, and tried to read. Ah! no. I could not take any sense of the words. I put out the light, and drawing aside the curtain, I sat down, the moonbeams falling about me in patches of quivering light. Wrapped in the unutterable stillness of the night silence I sat there vacantly, idly thinking, a solitary dreamer; while the moon went creeping slowly up the great blue dome, bathing me with its sorrowful light. I did not look into my heart. I could not tell if I were happy or sad, the feeling was so completely mingled of X ,     3I8         ATHOL., pleasure and pain. I only knew that John was not going away, and that for a little time longer we would all be  sheltered under the same dear old roof, and I put the evil  day of separation far, far away.           g CHAPTER XXIV.       ,3 JOHN broke the news of his sudden decision to Harrie the next morning at breakfast. To say she was surprised  would not at all convey an idea of her amazement. "Never tell me," she said, laying down her knife and fork in utter bewilderment, "Inconstancy thy name is - - zeoman."                    I John looked at me and I at him, and I could not avoid a conscious smile. She broke her egg complacently, de-  ldaring herself satisfied, and nothing more was said about it, only I think we had not made so pleasant a trio since sister's death as we did that morning at the breakfast  table. John read aloud to us the news-always war of  course. General McClellan was in command of the  army, but Grant had begun his series of remarkable suc- cesses, commencing with Forts Henry and Donelson.  We had begun our triumphs at last. Poor Geoffrey!! Our army was then occupying Manassas. This was the latter part of March, and all over the whole Southern  country fighting was going on; but all my interest in the  war had died with Geoffrey. I  rarely took up a paper  and looked it over. I  knew intuitively that we would in the end succeed, but it was such a wild, wild sea of blood  to pass through to reach that end that my heart sickened at the thought. But I  was very happy. If nothing else would cause     ATHOL.          3I9 me happiness, John's promise would, and I rejoiced in-his constant presence with an eager delight I did not attempt to hide, and which he seemed in a way to share. What- ever his doubts had been, he had put them firmly aside that night when he promised me to remain. I was with him now very much of my time, and he daily unbent more and more, until he was very nearly the imperious, yet kind, John of old. Again he read to us on stormy even- ings, or when we- three were alone, as very frequently happened, with the doctor's large practice to 'occupy him; again the piano was opened, and he would sing for us as he used, songs infinite and endless in their variety; or on still Sabbath evenings the old hymns and chants that sis- ter loved. And when the weather became milder and the roads were in good condition, he instituted long rides on horseback, in which Harrie and the doctor joined, and many a lovely view did we discover among the chain of hills around us. Sometimes Hal found some good excuse to keep her at home, and then we two would go out alone. But, wheth- er we staid at home or were out, somne way we were al- ways together. He selected the books he most wished me to r,ead; he looked over my German with me, directed my tastes, opened for me the storehouse of his thought and memory, and gave me each succeeding day something new to think over. Summer came on apace. The trees put on their robe of tender green, and birds, and sunshine, and warmth came back to us. Tennyson tells us of this same sweet spring-time, than when "---- -a deeper iris comes upon the burnished dove. In the Spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love." John was far too old to come into my mind this way, when I repeated the words softly over to myself,     320         ATHOL. and I laughed as I said them. Young?-there were sil- ver threads already in the abundant dark hair-but  he loved me, that I knew, and truly-father, guardian,  brother, friend-nothing more. Not since the night when he told me he was wronging me deeply to stay, had I  been able to discern wherein existed this great and grievous wrong. But I could not avoid seeing that in pro- portion as he grew necessary to me, so I also seemed to be to him a positive want of his life. ,Hal watched our growing confidence with a satisfaction I could not fail to perceive. Gone were all her jealousies, real and feigned, and she was never so happy as when I was with John.  E And as time went on, it became quite a settled matter, that whether walking, riding, or staying at home, we were to share it together. It was all very pleasant, to change so suddenly from being miserable and lonely, to being cared for, petted and indulged again, like the spoiled  child that I was. John had declared that his rides were at last confirmed habit-he could no more do without his gallop on the hills, than he could exist without any other imperative need of his life. I thought I would try him  one day, so taking out a long-neglected exercise I sat down diligently to my task, in my own room. Presently Harrie came up. "What upon earth ails you to-day, Athol? aren't you going out?" "No," I said, "I don't think I feel like riding to-day-  beside, I have neglected my German so long." I saw the horses brought around to the door, but still I sat there scribbling away, quite intent upon making up for lost time as I had told Harrie. Soon I heard John's impatient steps on the porch, heard Harrie telling him my decision, saw the horses go back to the stable again, and then a few minutes later heard his voice calling me. I ran to the staircase, book and paper in hand.   ATHOL.    .     321 "What is the matter, Daisy?" he asked. "No riding to-day? What new affliction has come upon you?" "Industry and remorse"I answered, laughing. I am going to make Guy open his eyes." ( You have made me open mine-won't that do?" "By no means," then turning to go back, "I am doing a lot of work up here." "Then bring it down right away to the library, and let me help you. It will soon be too warm to go out." "Oh! I am not going out at all," I said quite inno- cently, but gathering up my exercises and coming slowly down the stairs. "Remorse is a powerful stimulant, John-do you know I haven't been near the rectory for a week?" "Confound the rectory!" he said savagely, and set- ting me down in a chair by his side he soon completed the exercise for me. "Now go put on your habit, Daisy." "I can't to-day, John," stooping low over the table to conceal a smile. "We have waited so long and the sun is too hot now." "Nonsense! There is a perfect Euroclydon coming down from the hills now." "All the more reason I should stay at home." "You perveise little Daisy! What ails you to-day?" He put his hand under my chin compelling my eyes to meet his. I could not keep the laugh away from my face any longer. "You are teasing me, you spirit of audacity! I have been expecting the wilfulness to return-I am not the least unprepared for it you will find." And he lighted his cigar, walking up and down with his hands behind him, waiting to see what I would do. I went up to the book-shelves, took out a book and sat down by the window. He came over to my side di-, "*     322         ATHOL. rectly, and taking it from my hand began to read to me. There was no use. He would not go without me. After  reading for nearly an hour he looked up. "When will you be ready to go, Daisy?"  "Now," I answered, very gladly, for it was the stupid- est old book-all about the "Conservation of Forces,"  concerning which I had not the slightest curiosity, and John knew it full well, therefore he had relished the read- ing keenly. -"Where is Harrie?"  ' Gone, of course. Do you think she would lose the  best part of this perfect day as I have done waiting f1r r i you, little caprice?"  Without another word I ran up stairs, put on my habit, and in a few moments we were cantering down the av-   i enue. "How good you are to me, John," I could not resit t saying as we reached the gate.  "And what a wilful Queen Whims you are to try mie as you have done this morning," he answered smiling.  "Patience is one of your dormant virtues I find, and you may give me thanks for developing it.-But why did you wait? How did you know I would go out at all?" "I did despair of it when I saw how deeply interested  you were in that book, Daisy. I quite admire your taste. I had no idea of your thirst for knowledge." I gave Spit a cut of the whip and away we dashed. As we were going up the hill I found breath to say, "Then it is quite a foregone conclusion that I am to go out with you every day?" He reined in his horse, looking at me earnestly. "You don't dislike it do you, Daisy?" "I am afraid I like it only too well." I confessed truthfully.  He looked as if he would say more, but we rode on in silence until we reached the cool shade of the wood.   ATHOL.         323 Then we walked our horses through the dark, still, laby- rinth of trees, with the air around us heavy with aromat- ic earth scents and wild, fresh fragrance. The sun could not reach us here, and in the cool glades, listening to the mysterious murmurs of the forest, and by the side of a running stream, we tied our horses, and sat down on a bank, waiting for the heat of the day to pass before we returned. I took off my hat and tied it to a branch which hung near me, and sat down by John. He took out his cigar case and smoked indolently. "What a romantic creature is man!"I said laughing. For me I would be content to sit forever and look into this stream and dream, wasting a great deal of time, of course, and you can sit here and dim your vision as well as mine with cigar smoke; and look! other men, equally unpoetical, have been before you, if we are to believe the rocks."  "The Elixir of Life "started from the hill above us- a very good source, I must acknowledge-and "Tarrant's Seltzer Aperient " foamed in the very stream at which I was gazing, while "Pulmonic Wafers" grew on every tree, if they were labelled aright. I did not search, but "S. T. I86o, X," must have been somewhere about. Nevertheless John persisted in smoking, and I went back to my dreaming, coming out of it once in a while to chat with him, but it was not necessary to talk mtich. I knew he was as content as I; one glance at his face showed me that, and I wished life might glide on ever ad smoothly and serenely for me as now. Presently I wandered away, searching here and there for wild flowers, and going farther up the stream, crossed it where it was quite narrow, and so came down opposite where John was lying on the other bank. I sat down in a little wild nook, under a spreading tree, and began mak- ing my flowers up in a bouquet to take home, singing tp myself of "Robin Adair."     324         ATHOL. Y ou have run away from me," John called across. And then half in earnest, half jest, he quoted: "Between us two a great gulf is fixed so that neither can pass." "Indeed," I said practically, you can come across as I did, higher up." "No, I will sit and look at you here and rememrber  the parable Daisy. It will do me good, 'so that neihler K can pass;' yes, I will try and remember it." i t He was more than half in earnest)though his tone vas  jesting, and I didn't like him in one of those singtlar  moods of his, so I just said he could "pass" quickly S enough, if he were not too lazy. "No, I will sit here alone, thrust out of paradise, and view you, as it is right I should, from the other side." "You would have placed seas between us instead of this little stream if you had been allowed your own way,'1 I said reproachfully. "Don't be hard on me, little Daisy, but mitigate my sufferings in some degree. Sing that little song for e, e 'Robin Adair,' again." I was not singing it for you at all. I was just doi g it to please myself." "Please yourself again, Daisy." "Then I shall be silent and finish my bouquet." "And you were singing like a siren, but a moment ago."                   .  "And now you are laughing at me, and to punish yq u I will make the gulf wider." And I went farther into the wood, although he called me back and finally came after me. "How old are you, Daisy?" he asked when he h d found me. "Just twenty-three years younger than you, John."  He gave me a look that was intended for witherir g indignation and walked away.   ATHOL.         325 Presently he came back, as I knew he would. "Don't you think we had better be riding home child?" he said a little stiffly. 1 "Yes, by all means ;" then, turning around and looking in his eyes with a laugh which I could not resist, "I am nearly eighteen, John, you know."  Then we loitered back, through the wood, taking a long circuit around the stream, to reach the place where our horses were contentedly pulling the green boughs and twigs of the trees. This is only one among the many days I am recalling- days full of happiness and calmn content, which flew by with winged feet, and/ all this time John never spoke of going away-never spoke of joining the army, and going boldly forward as he had once said, to "liberty or death." And while he was lingering at home apparently forgetful of the great issue at hand, hard, cruel work, was going on, and the battles of Fair Oaks, Seven Pines and Malvern Hill had become among the things that were. CHAPTER XXV. THAT was a terrible summer down on the Peninsula. -Among our soldiers, disease carried off quite as many as the bullets of the enemy. Hot, burning and terrible, the sun poured down upon us here. What mustit have been down there? We had, like every other New England village about this time, our "Soldiers' Aid," and our busy, working set of wowren. Harrie and I did our share. John gave us money liberally, and bade us do all in our power; but some strange spell possessed him, for he took very little     326     '    ATHOL. -interest in the movement of our troops, or the constant change of their command. Yet, when some grand victory  was proclaimed how his eyes would flash, and he would i start up restlessly and eagerly, as if longing to share their' triumph. But the flush of enthusiasm would soon die away, and the light, which had been suddenly kindled  there, fade from his eye. ,i I did not feel well, that month of July; and our rides I were given up for a season. Harrie proposed the sea- i shore for a change, but I declared I would not leave home-it was only the heat which had prostrated me, knowing all the time that it was not that alone. It was lonly  a year since that first wild loss had come into my young 1 life--only a year since Geoffrey had gone away frot all this tumult and roar of battle, into the quiet and peace of  a boundless eternity. Had he only been a mere friend andn companion, I should still have marked the anniversary of his death with irresistible sadness,-but near and dear he was to me-not above all else--never above all lse, even when I loved him most, and, as the month and!day came around, I could not keep the shadow from my heart. Such a  sorrowful time it was too, in the whole land! Scarcely a village or hamlet that did not boast its heroic dead--scarcely a household free from the garb of mourn-  ing.  It was no wonder I sometimes mourned with those who mourned, yet, never alas! poor Geoffrey with that, deep sorrow he craved when he said to me, "God knows I want some of your tears, little 6ne." Truly I had given  him some, but were they not more of remorse than gri ef? I  think John understood me, for he tried his utmostt to please me, even in the most simple, minute thing, and watched me with a jealous, exacting tenderness that I could not resist. One day I  was coiled up in John's easy chair in the library, to which I was now at all times a privileged visi-   ATHOL.         3 tor, reading for the hundredth time the touching woes of the Capulet and Montague, and wondering if all the love of my life had died and gone out like Juliet's with my Romeo, when John came in, and picking up my book, as it had fallen in my lap, asked, "Why do you read such stuff, child?" "Stuff? indeed! oh! injured shade of Shakspeare," I adjured, " appear and avenge such wrong!" Even if I lose favor in your sight I must still acknowl- edge I never could endure that play. But you are look- ing pale, little Daisy. Aren't you well to-day?" "I suppose I am," smiling away his fears, " but it is so close and still-see, there is scarcely a breath of air to move even those vines around the window." "' Come with me, he said,"aiand I will read you some- thing more beautiful and touching by far than the sickly sentimentality of Juliet. Put on your bonnet and we will go up there." He pointed to the knoll back of the house, where the green shadow of the wood rested, seeming to woo us to their cool midst. "I know a bank--" he quoted. "I wish I knew one," I interrupted. "I would turn burglar." "And what then?" "A trip to Iceland, or any where to get a breath of cold, north wind." He drew my arm within his own, and we walked up the terraces back of the house, over the knoll, and took a shaded path to the woods. "We have not 'Eglantine or Rose,' but here' is the lnoss." And he led me   to a spot, thick and green with its velvety covering, and dark with overhanging trees. I sank down upon it, leaning against the trunk of a.     328   .      ATHOL. tree, and drank in the soft breath of the hills. The leaves just rustled with a faint little stir of instinctive life, and the brook gurgled along at my feet with a cool, babbling plash and fall.    .- "It is lovely," I said. "Your bank is better than mine after all." "And I have brought this to read to you."  He flung himself on the grass by my sider tossed off! his hat, and w[ sat in silence for some time. Then he  opened the book and began to read. It was a quaint little heart-history, passionate and wild in its appealing melody-the old, old story over again-tender, clinging, and pitiful-a woman's love, courage, and death, told in all the strength and pathos of a woman's large and sym- pathetic heart. I closed my eyes and listened to the music of the voice and words, and time flew on unh eded by us both, and the trees cast long shadows on the grass, and the cool soft air of nearing twilight floated al ound about us, and wrapped me irr a happy, quiescent attention. When he came to that part of the story whern the lady sought her lord, high on the castle wall, leadinig his favorite horse, he read it slowly, as if the words borte for him a far deeper meaning even-than that intended by the author. It was the hour for evening service, and far away, down in the valley, just faintly vibrating on the still air, the little bell in Guy's church tower" tolled slowly " il the pauses of the rhyme. That, and John's deep resonant voice, melting into unconscious pathos with the story as it dropped softly and tenderly from his lips-that wag the sole sound which disturbed the profound quiet of the place. I listened, chained to silence as to a spell. I hen he had ended he closed the book softly, as if he too felt the same spell- of silence. When he spoke at length it was low and passionately.   ATHOL.          329 "Child, Daisy, tell me could you love like that?" "If a woman loves at all she must so love," I said, never raising my, eyes. "Would you, too, risk danger and death-" he put out his hand, touching my arm--" would you ride like the fair little Duchess on the castle wall? Would you leap down with your Sir Guy into that abyss of death? Could you cling to him through such fearful doom? Tell me, would Death indeed ' open her sweet, white arms and whisper, Peace,' little one, think you?" The woods, the birds, the babble of the brook seemed far away from me, and in the hush of silence I only heard John's low tones, very low, but so distinct to me that all sights and sounds faded away, arid I heard only him. I raised my eyes to his, the first time I had trusted myself to do so. They were full of a strange, eager, but deter- mined light, and mine fell before them. "If I loved Sir Guy," I said softly. "Then you shall ride on the castle wall with me," he . said, throwing his arm around me and straining me to his heart in a clasp sudden and strong. "You shall take the danger with me, you shall brave the abyss, the death. I tell you, child, from henceforth we shall go together-for life and death." "For life and death!"I said slowly. "But it will not be death, John-it will be life, life to me." c My little darling!" and his voice sounded like a sob as I lay upon his heart. "All women take such love as their life, but it proves many and many a weary time to be the death, swift, sudden and sure, or the bleak abyss of despair. You do not fear the doom?" "And I must say, as I once said before," quoting it reverently with a great throb of thankfulness to Heaven for the gift," that' perfect love casteth out fear." "I put you away 'from me once, little Daisy. I put       330    ;     t ATHOL. you away from me cruelly. I cannot do it again. Y u must be mine now and forever."  "And I was always yours," I whispered with a re-  morseful feeling of pity for the dead who had bidden e  take confort in just such love. I tannot go back and  tell you when I did not love you. You were my ideal asa child; all my thought, and life, and hope went out to you when you claimed me as your own, that first night at the old Lodge gate." "Little one," he said caressingly, " you loved me be fore I loved you, and yet the child was dear to me fro the first-dearer every day and hour-how it grew into m heart I cannot tell, but it is there and will not be pu away. Many will blame me," he said musingly, "the will say I have imprisoned my little birdling; they wil say May and September ill befit each other; the world i a harsh judge, a relentless censor; they will say the young life will be blighted by the old, but I brave itf all. I can- not put her away, my little life," and he held me to .his heart; he took my two hands in his-I did not draw them away-I only nestled closer to his side, recognizing with a strange thrill the fact that I belonged to him hence- forth and forever. He kissed me again and again. He held my hands closely in his; " little white hands" which he had once put from him as too dainty and pure to touch! Hie must have read my thoughts in my face, for he said, as a flush rose to his cheek, I will take them now, Daisy, they are just as white and pure, and my own as stained as when I once put them aside. But it is fate, my darling, my life. You will not leave me, now or ever?" "Never, John!" I locked my hands around his arm and looked up in his face. Such a happy look it wore, and not since sister died had I seen so much content and rest gathered there,   ATHOL.         33T and the dark, earnest eyes thrilled me strangely, they were full of such untold love. You are satisfied and happy now?"I whispered. "So happy little one that my only fear is that the dream cannot last. Some shadow will sweep you from me as all pleasant things have been swept out of my life for many and many a year." "Then be happy in the present." "  Ah!" he interrupted. "I am indeed happy, and in our present joy let us bury the past and live only in the future." And it must be something more tangible than a mere shadow which will sweep me away from you now, John," I said. "Nothing can ever separate us but death," I added with a strange shrinking, remembering how death taken away such hopes from me before. The look of joy died out of his face slowly. "'There are worse things to bear in this life, Daisy, than death. Wrong and dishonor and remorse are heavier burdens to carry in our hearts than the pure memories of the dead. Oh! my little darling, I wish for your sweet sake I were a better man, and' that there were no other weight beside years on my soul." "I would not have you other than you are for worlds," I said vehemently. "I love you just as you are, John! I cannot even part with these few marks of time," touching the dark locks, with here and there a silver line in their blackness. "Dear little heart! But you remember how even the disciple loved once, and yet, my darling, there came a time when he too denied-his master." "Et tu Brute," I said w'thout looking up. And his only answer was to draw me closer and more closely to him without another word of foreboding or warning.. His hand smoothed back my curls gently, and his touch as of old conveyed love and tenderness in it. 1.     332          AT-IOL.         ; For me it was a joy wonderful and absorbing as it was unexpected. He had been, as I told him, since the first  night of our meeting, my ideal of all that was noble, chiv- alrous and true. He had stood above me like a demi-ghd in his strong middle age, his mature mind and cultiyated taste, and now he had stooped to take me to his heart! He had lifted me-even me-so young, so untried, so be-  neath him, to his own proud place, and henceforth I  would walk by his dear side, on those heights his wisdom  had scaled! He would give me his name, position, heart, himself! He had said he loved me; always had loved me; i he had called me his little wife-dear God! what could I ask in this world more? And my cheeks were aflame ar d my pulses bounding, as I said over and over in my heart, "Forevermore." This was the home I should know--" for life and for death," John had said, and my heart hushed itself to rest with the single thought "Forevermore."  The air was cooler when we sauntered home, "in the gloamin'," his arm about me, his hand putting aside tle overhanging branches so I might pass, and I thought how we should walk ever thus through life, as we were walk- ing then in the dim, old wood. What if the path wee sometimes stony and steep,. and the shadows of night set- tling around us, so his strong arm were about me I could walk safely through any gloom. We did not say much. What need?  The language of love is, an unwritten poem, a heart throb, an untranslatable emotion. What need of speech when each knows the other's thought, ald silence is more eloquent than words? When we reached the garden gate, coming down t sublunary things in my matter-of-fact way, I asked suc- denly, "What will Harrie say?" "That she will love you like a sister, I hope," linge - ing there a moment as he spoke. "Can she say anythin more, cherie " !"   ATHOL.         3 3 "A very great deal more, if she chooses. You don't know Hal. Beside," I faltered, "I must acknowledge I tried my best to persuade her the doctor was too old." "And you will find, my little Daisy, that Harrie will be more fair in love than in war. She loves you like a sister already, only, as I said before, I wish for your sake I were a younger and better man."  And he closed the garden gate, leading me under the tall shrubs and flowering plants, heavy with odor and dew; and half-way up to the house we met Harrie, with her Shetland shawl thrown over her head, coming in search of us. "Such romantic people," she said. "I have been sitting alone in the twilight until I was afraid to stay there any longer, and came out to find you." "And here we are," John said, as he drew her arm within his, still holding me closely with the other. "And I have something to tell you, sister mine, if you are ready to listen." But before she could hear what that something was, I had slipped suddenly away from him, and ran swiftly up the walk to the house'alone. I sat down on the porch, in a tumult of conflicting emotions, waiting for them to come up, and not caring to hear what Iarrie should say, when the news was broken to her. To tell the truth I dreaded her sarcasms as much as anything else, but I was amazed when after walking around the circle twice very slowly, she came up to the porch with John, stooped over me, and kissing me very quietly and entirely unlike herself in every way, said, "I am so glad, Athol, darling! This is just as it should be-I have wanted you for a sister a very long time." And John taking me ini his arms said some thing about his "little wife," and I could only look up through sudden tears and feel that indeed I had found a home at last.     334         ATHOL.             e "How now?" laughed Harrie, looking in my eyes, X and seeing the ever-ready tears. "This comes of rea- [ ing that everlasting old Romeo and Juliet, John, ani  following her example with, 'evermore showering,' car- rying in her 'little body,' like Juliet, a bark, a sea, a wind.' I had rather, my dear, be Peggotty. It is in- ! finitely more comfortable."            -  And she discreetly went into the house, pretending to be very busy lighting the lamps, and leaving John and -me to ourselves. "John's wife!"I heard him as in a dream. But the  words vibrated in my heart for that and very' many suc- ceeding days, and sleeping or waking the trembling music of his voice was ever heard. Sometimes in the solemnl night-time I waked suddenly with a great hush of happi- ness stilling my soul as I thought over the mystery and pleasure of his love. It abode with me always, like a spirit of peace, a heavenly benediction. But I could' not understand why, if John were so happy, he could allow a shadow or doubt to come into his heart. He had said his only fear was the dream would not last. Was it to be only a dream? and would I ever rudely waken? I could' understand his love, but not his remorse. Not for many and many a day did it come to me. Then it burst upon me like a great horror and would not be put aside. Then in those days of darkness and dread, I too, oh! true prophet, like Peter denied my master. I   ATHOL.          335 CHA'PTE R XXVI. WE were to be married very soon--so John said. He could not endure a long engagement, and Harrie with in- stant appreciation approved the idea. To come down to sober reason and the truth, she was as anxious to have me formally installed as mistress of Brookdell, as she to be settled in like manner at the Poplars. I heard them both passively and as in a dream. I had no suggestions to make or offer. John loved me, and I was to be his wife! What need I desire more? What did I care for the paltry minutiae of wedding display; the bridesmaids, the guests? I was simply his. Nevermore to be parted from him. Never, in the long years stretching before me, to walk alone-sleeping or waking,-by day or by night,-in life and through death,--and for all eternity, I said to myself with a wicked feeling, of asking or caring for nothing in this life, or in the world to come, but his love. I cared to live for only that alone. The days glided by like a dream, and I passively yielded to every influence of love; forgetful, absorbed, walking closely by John's side, feeling as each day ended, with a wild blas- phemy, that I had been nearer heaven that day than ever before, and I walked forwardto the end, basking in the sunshine of my life and lingering over every trivial joy. All I cared for was to love and be loved in return, living only in the present and for him. "Would I be ready in two weeks?"John demanded im- periously one day, brooking no delay. "In three? In four?"     336         ATHOL.  "In two days, if he liked," I said, yielding weakly.! (I suppose weakly is the right word to use in such a case?) But Harrie demurred. She pleaded her own long suffer- ing patience, as well as the doctor's. It should by a double wedding, and we were not to be married a day or an hour before she was! She should wait until aboutlthe Christmas festival. She was determined, and so John was obliged to submit, for Harrie, as I have before slightly in- timated, had a will of her own-as well as her brother. "We will have a very quiet wedding," Harrie said, one morning at breakfast, while John was lingering over his coffee, and I, as I never indulged in the beverage, was  amusing myself by tearing open the newspapers and overlooking the mail just arrived.      I  "Oh! yes. By all means very quiet," John assented looking up. "Have it all your own way, Hal, only give me Daisy very soon," he stipulated, stealing his hand into mine and giving it a little pressure. "I happen to have an unfortunate memory," t1hat young lady answered, " and I recollect quite distinctly Low my own marriage was deferred without so much as a air hearing. That was all Athol's fault too, come to remem- ber! There are a great many unsettled accounts between us yet, sister of mine, soon to be! Toss me a. paper, there's a dear."  I threw her the "Herald." John and I religiously read the "Tribune " in a frantic endeavor to keep up the family dignity, as Harrie, since her engagement, had openly es- poused the cause of the opposite party. As a matter of duty she always went through the Personals first-then the murders, for Hal enjoyed a " first class murder," as she called it, and only such were reported of course in that most decorous sheet-then she would look over the mar- riages and deaths--last of all the war news. Suddenly she laid down the paper.   ATHOL.         337 c"Here is a draft for three hundred thousand men or- dered! It is just as the doctor said. The draft would follow the call. Your President is coming out another Saturn! John, thou sturdy patriot, awake thou that sleepesU Arise, valiant little State of Massachusetts!  she Lghed with malicious pleasure. /"Three hundred thousand more!"I said drearily echoing her words. "Oh! John, what shall you do?" "Why pack his knapsack, bless Mr. Lincoln, and join the ranks-as I know he is dying to do! And there will be no wedding this year. Oh! Athol, my dear, what a blessing to live in this age of liberty and reason " I did not look at her but turned to John. "Must every man go?" "Every one that is drafted; or he can send a substitute." "You would never go and leave me now?"I asked tremulously. "You would never do that?" His hand clasped mine but his eyes went far, very far beyond me. "Daisy, I don't know-sometimes I feel as if I were neglecting my duty cruelly." Harrie uttered a very energetic " stuff and nonsense!" returning again to h4r paper while John pushed away his cup walking up to the open window. I followed him, putting my arm through his. He stooped down kissing my forehead and drawing me closely to him. k' Do you think you could be very brave and bid me go, little one?" he whispered. "You could buy a substitute," I argued readily. Money will do anything, John." "It will do a great deal, my darling. I need never go. But all the same, I should feel I was doing my coun- try and party a great wrong," he said earnestly. "Do you love me better than country, or party, John?" I asked softly, and clinging to him in my childish way, feeling lost in the gloom already. I5 )     338         ATHQL.9  X s Better than'all else in the world, my little one. ii Better than country, or life-or heaven, or God, some- times I am forced to think!" "And that is blasphemy, John," I said gravely, re- membering my own sinful thoughts. "Don't tell me that again." -                  - Ah! well did he lose me, and every fibre of my being thrilled with the certainty of the enrapturing possession, as he folded me to his heart, his great manly heart. How proud I was of him! How dearly I loved him! How I nestled to his side as he clasped me closer!  How soon those arms would stoop to take me in, and hold me safe, for evermore-for evermore! Down the long uncertain future I could see nothing but the fulness of his love, and sure protection. Oh! blinded vision. Oh! foolish dreamer. But I would never give him up! What did I care for country, or party, or flag?  What good would it do me if I had left to me " only my dead?" He should never leave me! Oh! when would this wleary war end, and what great good would be accomplished if we were to come off conqueror to-morrow, I asked myself, It looked like anything but an ending just then, with a draft ordered and our poor soldiers dying like sieep down on James River. Not a step had been taken yet which looked like tending to a speedy termination. No, John should never go; and while I was thus thinking he stood still in the window, his brow knitted resolutely in thought; his eyes far, far away, and Hal was very nonchalantly Irun- ning over the papers, still seated at the table.  "Come over here," she said, beckoning me to her. '"Such lovely goods advertised, and so fabulously cheap! We must make brother take us to town," forgetting all about the new call for troops, and the heavy needs of the country. "Positively, Athol, we must go' and select! our wedding trousseau. We'll propose that thing at once. L I   ATHOL.          39 Why, nonsense, child, you are as pale as a ghost, and your eyes full of tears, again I declare!" "At what, I said?" "Indeed then-John'llonot go. Show him that face of woe and he would stay if the country were lost for lack of him!" And having very coolly put the subject out of her mind, she went on with her plan for going to the city. "It is too warin," I argued, and having no thought of dress. "And how long will this 'heat last, pray? No. It is settled. The first cool day we go. Do you realize that in a little over three months' time you will be sole mistress of the mansion? And what have you done toward adorn- ing this 'sinful body,' you poor little worm. Absolutely nothing. You cannot live on love, my dear, as Doesticks threatened to do with his ' Calanthe Maria.' In short, you must be carnal-minded, and indlige in some new gowns. It is all very well to read about ' the lilies of the field,'" she went on, "but I am practical enough to ask: 'Wherewithal shall I be clothed upon my wedding day? '" "Shall we take off these, Hal?"I asked touching my black dress, which I had worn since sister's death. A grave look came into her face. "I do not know. We must ask Alice. For my own part I could wear them always when I think of her who has gone. But will it be proper? Will it be right to wear weeds of woe when we are so happy?--for you know we are happy, Athol," with a kindling in her dark eyes, " and it is right we should be." "I will ask John," I answered. "I would like to wear whatever he-would be pleased with." And that evening we talked it all over together, and John approving Harrie's plan, decided we were to go to the city very soon, as soon as practicable, and select all we needed.  "And my darling," he said calling me back to     340         ATHOL. him, and prolonging his good-night as if there were no S to-morrow dawning for us, " wear white, or some of tlhose  pretty light colors you used to wear when you first came among us." - "White in winter, John?" "Bah! Do not wait for winter-get them now." "But this is the last of our warm weather, and I must prepare for the all-important occasion, you know." "Get something bright then, Daisy, my love. I Cannot bear to see you look so sombre."      i "It seems so like forgetting "-then I stopped, epent- ing my careless words when I saw the pain they caused., ("There will always be room in our hearts for tender memories," he said with emotion. "I never liked th'is garb of mourning. It is sufficient to carry it in our hearts, I think, without parading it before the world." "I want to please you," was all I answered. He stood'still a moment looking down at me earnestly. "Why what an obedient little puss it is," turning my face up to the light and reading all the happiness gath- ered there. "You have not had one fit of wilfulness since you promised to be mine, little one, do you know it? How long will it last, cherie?"  "Forever," I said softly, and leaning my head upon his breast. "I am so happy I cannot be perverse any more. Oh! John, John, will it last? Will I always be so haJppy?" "If I can make you so, nmy darling," he said gravely and tenderly. "God knows you are more than life to me now." "And you will not leave me?"I pleaded. "You will never go into this horrid war?"           He looked at me long and earnestly, sighing as he looked.  Then I repeated my question.      i "I told you once before, little Daisy," he said, "that I[1   ATIIOL.         341 I had forgotten honor and duty and even a promise to the dead, for you: I cannot dishonor myself more than I have done already! No. I will never go until you bid me, child." I was surprised at the bitterness of his voice, at the sudden look of remorse which flashed guiltily into his face, as I had seen it come once or twice before, and as I looked up wonderingly, something in my steady gaze mnade his falter.  "What is it, John?" trying to make him look at me. "Do you love me-no-I know you love me; but do you trust me entirely, little one?" still averting his gaze. What ay absurd question!  Love without trust! And I not yet eighteen! Surely he was laughing at me. But no, his face was quite grave and fixed, and the eyes were not resting upon me at all. I put my two hands in his, and leaned my head against his shoulder. "How could you ask me . such a question?" with a reproachful sob in my voice. "Because, I wish some times," he answered, " my dear love-I wish sometimes that you did not love and trust me so much." "John!" "I am so little worthy, my darling," he said hastily as he saw how his words cut me. "So little worthy your pure, childlike love. I wish for your sake, as I have wished so many times, there were no weight heavier than years on my soul." "If you love me," I said tremulously, "I do not care for anything beside." "'What! If you knew I was perfectly, utterly un- worthy? Oh! DaiSy, my darling, would you cling thus to me through any sin or wrong?" I quoted him two little lines of Burger's for answer. Wicked little lines they are, but I meant it. Every woman     342         ATHOL. means it, even if she dare not thus express it. It is Hell without Wilhelm" to many and many a heart, and Paradise and Heaven come down to us indeed, and dwell with us for evermore if we have but him. What could John say to me? He could not diim my  joy, or destroy my faith, or reason me out of mny love.  Ah! was not life a fair thing to look forward to in that vanished time, and who could foresee the clouds slowly  rolling up in the future? If John did, I would not  CHAPTER XXVII. ANOTHER .month went by. Stimulated by Harrie's zeal and determination to outdo " the lilies," I had made considerable progress in the matter of suitable apparel, and was quite ready and willing to go to the city when she proposed a time. The doctor did not accompany us-only John, Hal and I. I was glad to go; glad to see again the great city, my only remembrance of which was confused and fragmen- tary; seen first through the mists of early morning las we neared it from the bay, and later in the whirl of hurried sight-seeing with which John had indulged me, the day after our landing. How differently I entered it this time! And yet I hardly loved John more, so entirely had I given him my heart at our first meeting.  He took us everywhere. First, through their famous and beautiful park, of which they may justly be proud. To me it was like a glimpse into an enchanted fairy-land, with its little silver lakes and gliding boats, rustic bowers, bridges, and exquisite carvings of stone and marble and the beautiful Mall with its crowds of gayly-dressed chil-   ATHOL.          343 dren and sober, admiring pedestrians; and around it all, like an ever-shifting panorama, the whirl and dash of glittering equipages. Was it any marvel my plain country vision was dazzled? And then there were the picture galleries to saunter through in the daytime, and the shops to visit, John buying for us lavishly whatever pleased our fancy, and bewildering us every day with new and unex- pected pleasures. "There's a darling," said Harrie coaxingly one day. "Take us to the theatre, John. You have done everything but that to please us, and the whole world you know is going mad over the ballet, and Athol and I really long to share the lunacy. It is shocking bad taste," she ex- plained to me; "but I am dying to see it and be demoral- ized with the rest, aren't you?" Of course I was. I had never been to a theatre in all my life. But John did not like it. He would take us to concerts, to the opera. Would not Harrie give up this disgusting ballet? Oh! by no means would she, and yielding in this matter as he did in all others lately, John took a box for us two or three days in advance, and Har- rie's delight knew no bounds. But when the all-important evening arrived it found her very nearly ill with a nervous headache, the result of too much sight-seeing and dissi- pation, John said. But go she would, and we dressed ourselves as gayly as children making ready for their first party. As I said before I had never been to a theatre. I had not even obtained a glimpse of the exterior of one of these buildings, until this visit to the city. Its open doors and marble paved courts, the great flaring gas jets and immense letters duly setting forth the play, was in itself a. novelty. And then the interior-so vast, so closely packed, so brilliantly lighted; such a bewildering garden of flowers, faces, fluttering fans and glittering lorgnettes,     344         ATHOL. that I was quite giddy for a moment after we took our X seats. That it was something very worldly and sinful I had been always taught to believe; but I was totally un-  prepared to see " the world, the flesh and the devil'" in  such an intoxicating light. I had almost feared i might  be another "Inferno " from what I had heard on the sub-  ject, and was surprisec that so many respectable heads  of families should be looking so complacent and placid when so much was atstake. But I had only a moment for this reflection when with the tinkling of a bell the  overture ended and the curtain was slowly lifted, and a  world of enchantment revealed. I knew nothing of the trickery of the stage, its illusions and delusions, the effect of light, the tinsel, the daubs on canvas at which I gazed in absorbed fascination, as if they were the highest types of art. The play began with a group of dancing girls bounding upon the stage, clashing their tinkling casta- nets, and lightly and gracefully moving in time with the music. I leaned back in my chair never moving my eyes from the airy figures flitting before me. I watched every graceful evolution, every toss of their arms, every Lurve and change in the dance. It was indeed to me the poetry of motion. I drew a long breath when they had' van- ished, and looking up saw John smiling down at me "You liked it, Daisy? I need hardly ask."  "And do not you?"I questioned in surprise. "Oh! John, they are so beautiful! To me they seem scarcely human!" ' I am afraid some of them are not," he said, with a little comical smile. "Will they come on again?" not noticing his rem rk. "' Why, my darling, you have only seen the poorest part of the co ps. The really fine dancing has not begun. I can appreciate that, Daisy, as well as you."  "Can anything be finer? I asked in surprise.      ATHOL.         345 "You are a dear little unsophisticated Daisy," he answered, laughing. You can watch the play and I will watch you. I like that better than all else." "Then," I said, "you can read all the pleasure you are giving me without my uttering a word of thanks." "Be it so, little one." And he placed his chair near me, looking down at me, while in another moment I was absorbed in the play, the constantly-shifting scenery, and beautiful appointments of the stage. There was no deep plot that I could dis- cover, or if any, it was not worth remembering. To me it was only a confused glitter of demons and dancers. One interesting embodiment of his Satanic Majesty, in red, with a vicious-looking pitchfork in his hand, was so intensely like the personage Elsie had pictured to me in my childhood, that I really felt like meeting him as an old' acquaintance. But I had very little interest in anything but the ballet, after all. To me there was something positively ethereal in the fleecy dress and the graceful bound of the coryphee, and I lost sight of all else in look- ing at them. Once Hal leaned forward and, to my astonishment, said she was ready to go home. "Don't you like it, Hal?"I asked hurriedly. "Oh! do stay. Surely you never saw anything like this before?" "And hope never to again! Very true. Well, I'll not cut you short of delight, my dear, but when you are ready, say the word." "Nobody likes it but me," I said in disappointment. "It is too bad." "Oh! yes they do. Only look at the delighted faces around us. Look, for instance, up there. I assure you those young men appreciate the thing hugely." I raised my glass and looked at the point indicated. A group of fast-looking young men were lounging at the *I5     346         ATHOL. entrance of the galleries, laughing, talking, leaning against the open doors-hats on, and glasses levelled at the  dancers as they flitted to and fro upon the stage.  "They are waiting for the second act," explained  John. 'I am told many comel in only to see this. And here there will be really fine choregraphy--some rivalry,  too, I believe." And he turned down the programme, showing me the names of three of the most celebrated of the company who had not yet appeared. "Then we will wait for this, John?" "If you like and are not tired." "Oh! I would never tire of it. But poor Harrie's head."  "And you know how fond she is of playing the mar- tyr, therefore we will stay, cherie. I think I could never weary of watching your pleased face." And then until the curtain fell we did not speak again. How shall I go back and tell of that evening? Even now I recall the time with a strange pang, and worder that I can remember it all so distinctly. Let me think it over again, quietly and soberly, and from that poinl of distant time. That second act! Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if we had gone home as 4 ar- rie proposed! But we did not. We waited with the I est of the house for the three rivals to appear. I thought of the "Three Maries, so celebrated in history. "Th ire was Marie Seton and Marie Beton "--I forget the rest, and I also forgot the names of these Maries. For le there was but one, and to the day of my death I thin I shall never forget "Millie Marie!" Let me recall if I can the scene. A fairy realm, an (n- chanted lake, a dim- grotto, and graceful figures flitting in the dark and shadowy background, a green peculiar li ht. overspreading all. w   ATHOL.         347 Every movement they made was reflected on the trans- parent foreground. They saw the shadows, they kissed their hands, they waved their arms. Scarcely human they seemed to me. More like houris than women. In and out among the green, under the arching trees, on the clear surface of the enchanted lake they floated, while I sat breathless, absorbed, speechless with delight and wonder. The music low and soft at first, grew fuller and stronger with each new caprice of the danseuse. The light sud- denly changing burst full and glowing upon the scene. The two figures fled like startled fawns and with one bound Millie Marie leaped upon the stage. A burst of applause greeted her entrance, and so prolonged was it that she stood waiting until it should cease, then suddenly ran down to the footlights dropping before the approving audience in a gesture so profound, so graceful, that we only saw the gleam of her golden hair and a flash of white, like tossed sea spray around her. Then back into the shadow she floated with a slow, undulating motion like a feather blown wantonly by the wind. Ah! this was true art; wonderful, enthralling, bewildering. But even in that indistinct moment there was a something which struck me in this face, just seen for an instant as it disap- peared, as if somewhere I had met it before. Where? Never in all my life before had I seen a ballet-dancer- but even in that flash, there was a dim recognition! The shadows upon the painted moonlight were so dark I could not perfectly see face or expression, until sud- denly back she leaped, into the full blaze of light again. A star, dazzling and literally blazing at every point slowly revolved in the centre of the stage. She paused, threw up her fair arms, and then with one quick bound stood poised upon its glittering point; slowly revolving she stood with arms stretched forth, her head thrown back, the changing light falling full for the first time upon her i      '     348         ATrIIOL. upturned face. Her flee y dress, spangled and stafry-- the lace falling off mistil from the shoulders-the short  crisp aureole of golden h ir-the knot of flowers at the corsage front-Heavens! what a shock! Some one be-  hind me said "Good God!" but in a voice so changed I scarcely thought it John's. I turned around. His voie  changed? Oh! not so much as his face-white, fixe, e stern, he looked at the be utiful vision before him, with a gaze which grew despairin in its agony. His emotion- my own quick intuition confirmed my suspicion t once. Like a flash of lightning it all came before me! The little miniature case 1 King hidden in John's desk-L  the laughing, girlish face, of the myth Adele! If the bluhe eyes looked at me mockingly from the smooth ivory, morte mocking were they in realit as slowly searching tier aft r tier her gaze wandered to ur box-flashed upon me- then past me to John. I s w it in an instant! The wild  glare of recognition, like a blinding flash! The white lips-the sudden swaying forward-she would have fallen but for the ballet-master's ready hand. In vain she strove to rally. One burst ore of music, one feebly ex- ecuted pas and the curtain fll amidst a shower of bou- quets and a storm of applause.  Harrie sitting still conce led by the curtain, had been \ an unconscious observer of he scene. She had not re- membered as I had-she onl said wearily: "I am glad it is over-ready to go Athol?" "Quite ready," stilling mjr voice to composure, though a dread sharp as the fear of death was thrilling me. "And you, John?" "Hoh! yes-whenever you please, little Daisy." But his voice was husky a d his face had not lost its pallor. He threw Harrie's cl ak about her, and turned to do the like service for me, ne vously making haste to de- part when-was it fancy, or id I see at this moment   ATHOL.         349 the curtain pushed aside, and a face peering out just for a moment at us. "There!"I cried hurriedly. ' There!" and I caught John's arm pointing him the spot. But in an instant the curtain had fallen in its place. He caught up my bou- quet hurriedly. He drew my arm within his own. "Did. anything frighten you, petite?" he whispered. "What did you wish me to see?" "Oh! John," I explained breathlessly, "I safv a face I fancied I had seen before, peering at us so balefully from the curtain just drawn a little aside." "And a deuce of a flncy you have, Daisy," he said with an attempt at a laugh, "once you indulge it. But come. You will have a worse headache than Harrie to- morrow, I fear." And we quickly left our box and gained our own room. John never spoke until we reached it. A feverish haste seemed to possess him to get away-to be by himself- but he never said a word until he flung himself into his arm-chair. "There, my pets!" in a voice very nearly his own again, "I have pleased you and been horribly bored my- self-off with you, now darlings, and give me an hour or two to write and think-I have much to do." "And you were good enough to be bored for a whole long evening for our sakes and work half the night to pay for it, the prince of brothers that you are!" said Harrie, putting up her lips for a good-night kiss; "well-if you were bored, frankly I'll confess I was." "But I was not," I said leaning my head upon John's shoulder and dropping down by his side. "I thought it perfect and Millie Marie bewitching!" and my heart beat thick and fast as I asked "What did you think, John?" He bent down pretending to arrange some papers and never looked at me.     350         ATHOL. "You should see them, Daisy, my love, with all the paint and stage trickery away. They are very common human beings then, my little novice." - "But this one," I persisted, "this Millie Marie is dif-  ferent from the others. Don't you think she must have been beautiful once, John " His forehead contracted in  a sudden frown. "Really, Daisy, I am no judge of such women or their beauty-and now run away and good-night to you." He raised my head from his shoulder, touching my forehead with his lips as he put me away. "May I not sit here by you while you write?" "By no means! Go to bed and dream all the en- chantments of to-night over again. Stay-as a reward, I'll write to you too to-night, petite."  "Me?" bushing with pleasure, and then trembling with dread. "You never wrote me but one little letter, John-just the coldest, most formal letter, from Paris- but I've got it yet." "Have you, Queen Whims? Well then-I'll promise you this one I write you to-night will be the very reverse of my first. Now will you go?" There was nothing to' do but obey, but as I clung to him for a last good-night, I whispered-"Do you love me to-night, John?" "My darling!" reproachrully. "How can you ask? Because I send you away? if so, I will keep you by my side forever." But all the same I knew he wanted' me to I go-he longed to be alone. And my brain was positively reeling with excitement, wonder, and strange premonition. Who was this Millie Marie, and who was Adele? were they one and the same, or was it a trick of my fancy, and a touch of the old jealous foreboding. Surely if there were anything to tell, John would have told me before this. I would ask him to-morrow, to-night even, after his   ATHOL.         351 writing were done, and if he loved me he would explain all about the miniature, and the fancied resemblance-it must be a fancied resemblance, And I went up stairs slowly following Harrie, who was really suffering more than she had all the day, with the heat, the lights, and ever-shifting scenery of the stage, to increase her nerv- ousness. When we retired to her room, I helped her undress, and then sat by her bedside bathing her head, and talk- ing her finally to sleep in a low soothing way. Then I turned down the gas and went into my own room. I was eager and excited, and sleep was far from my eyes, though I cou giv-myemself no tangible reason for the feeling. The more I thought of it, the more absurd grew the sup- position, that Millie Marie and Adele were one. A mere French ballet-dancer! cduld anything stand lower in the social scale? and John-John Graeme? I was wronging him even in thought-and yet-he might in his youthful days of folly-he might have known this woman very well--might even have loved her in a way, I thought with a flush on my cheeks; he had been educated abroad, at a German University proverbial for its loose morality. He was anything but a saint even now, I reluctantly con- fessed to myself. He had told me once his life had been far from pure-was he going to confess it all to me in that letter he had promised me to-night? and what- ever the sin I will forgive it him, said my idolatrous heart. I went up to my open window and leaned out looking at the crowds going up and down Broadway. The gas lamps shone full on the people coming out of the theatre. The play was just concluded and I watched the living stream surging backward and forward, stepping into car- riages and omnibuses which blocked up the street until the complete confusion wearied me. I stole in to look at Harrie again; she was sleeping very quietly. I put the     352         ATHOL. cologne on a chair by her bedside lest she should waken and need it, and then wen: down to John. "He might be writing still," I thought, " -ut if through would be glad ;o see me again." We had hardly had a moment to our-  selves since the journey was undertaken, so I threw my  opera-cloak about my shoulders, going in very softly There was a little drawing-room, which we all used, and communicating with it a small closet, or dressing-rooln,  leading to John's apartment. Into this little closet I passed noiselessly fearing to disturb him, and as I stepped upon the thick carpet I could hear the hurried scratch o his pen. So I did not go in to him, knowing full well lhe would come in where I was for a last cigar, when he had finished. I lay down on the lounge before the open door and where I could look at iim. He sat at the' table in the centre of the room, his head bent forward, his peh moving rapidly. There was a pile of sheets closely filled, one over the other, on the table before him.  long letter-was it to me? Hal and I used oftet to laugh about his long letters. It really seemed to me sometimes he had more work of that kind on hand than a lawyer with a full practice, or a c untry editor obliged to write all the articles himself. I did not feel like laughing at  him to-night, however, for his dark handsome face looked flushed and anxious, and his lips were compressed, after an old fashion of his whernanything annoyed him. H- should tell me all when he had ended his writing. What- ever it was I -must know it. I would take his tired heal upon my shoulder and turn comforter to him, instead of vice versa as generally happened in my petty tribulations. Heaven only knows wlhat weak idolatry I indulged ill while I lay there; and once or twice I lost nmyself in e half sleepy way, turning my new joy over in my heart, and wondering, as girls sometimes do, how they ever become what I knew I had to John, a positive necessity of his   ATHOL.         353 life, when I thought I heard a low tap at the door, and on the instant it swung softly open, and a woman stood upon the threshold. She closed the door noiselessly be- hind her, and stood with her back to it a moment stead- fastly regarding Mr. Graeme. My heart gave one wild throb, then I leaned forward, intent and watchful, drinking in every gleam of her cold blue eye, and waiting with all the intensity of eagerness to hear her speak. It was Millie Marie, whom we had watched, but a few hours be- fore, bounding on the stage-yes, Millie Marie and Adele! With her mocking blue eyes and her golden hair-- tangled and tossed it was now, and there were years of pain and sorrow and hard, wicked life in the lines, which, under all the paint, I could see had settled with the slow, revolving years, since her face had been transferred to the smooth ivory of John's miniature. Yes, I could not be mistaken. It was Adele, and I grew terrified when my heart ques- tioned, "Why was she here?"John wrote on rapidly. He did not see or hear her. Suddenly, with a swift, cat-like movement, she glided to his side, laying her hand upon his arm and hissing out his name in sharp, sibilant French. His name, and still another--the name of husb'and! A dead, sickening faintness came over me in which Isaw John dash off her hand with an oath, defying her right to call him by that name. "You cannot deny it!" she gasped, "your lawful wedded wife whom you left to starve." "Stop!" he cried with a dark, vindictive look of hatred. "Stop, Adele. Never dare to use that name again! Do not dare even to look in the face of the man you have so deeply wronged-what! I left you to starve, Adele? It is a lie! God knows I cared for you-forgave you-even-poor deluded brute that I was, went on lov- ing you until all the knowledge of your cursed infamy was forced upon me; and then, after years of the most fear-     354         ATHOL. ful torture and retribution, I gave you up as dead." He  sat down almost helplessly in his chair, leaning his hea upon his hands, murmuring in a kind bf a dazed way, "I  thought you dead, Adele "  How with a strange pang I recall that time, and my wonder if John had ever loved this woman as he had me! Her old water-proof cloak had fallen off, and as slhe e sprang forward and stood crouching before him, under the  chandelier, all the paint, tinsel and flimsy trickery of the . stage became apparent. This creature, so beautiful, so rav- ishing houri-like only a few hours before-and now so spec- tral, so suffering, so sinful-her face-her' fragile ar shs even, covered with the loathsome paint, which concealed so many ravages of want and time-this bedizened, ta  dry, ghostly puppet, John's wife? And what, oh! m  God, was I then to be? Lying there, torturing my throb  bing brain with this wild thought, I heard her voice lo0v and pleading in answer to him. With a strange, shrinl- ing helplessness, I saw her sink upon the carpet by his side; lower and lower her head sank until she lay grove-  ling almost at his feet. "I have been nearly dead, John,-sometimes I thin it cannot be very far off even now. I have endured mis eries that even your strong nature would-shudder at-oh! if you but knew! It was as much as I could do to ge through to-night. Some days I lay more like one dea than alive. There's scarcely a thing to make a living b that I haven't tried and failed." "Did you fail with McWhorter?" asked John sternly taking away his hands and looking at the miserable woma for the first time. He left me," she murmured con fusedly-" everybody left mre-no one ever was so gooc to me as you-oh! John," breaking into a wild, pitiful cry -" only try me once again."  "Listen, Adele," and he looked down at her with a dark   ATHOL.         355 deliberate,set purpose in his face, which frightened me as I gazed. "Listen to me. I not only deny your right to claim protection from me, but I cast you off to-night utterly and forever! I will never see you again from this time forth, so help me Heaven! -I nearly ruined myself andfamily," he went on bitterly, "with my cursed folly. I broke my old father's heart, and blighted my sister's life for your sake, and the charm of your fair, false face. I became an outcast from Jhome and country; if I have blackened my 'soul with sin; if I have made my life a dis- grace and falsehood; if I have put every pure and per- fect thing from me as if it were a cheat and a lie; if I have bartered all hope of heaven and if I reach hell at last, it is all your doing, Adele Geffroi! You shall an- swer to God for my soul as well as your own sin! In that last great day, He shall judge between us two if-" and I knew he was thinking of me-" if the love of a good, innocent child will not save me yet." She leaped up suddenly to her feet. "You will marry the little girl I saw with you to-night! You will cast me off for her, with her little white face and impish eyes! I saw you lean over her and give her the flowers she carried in her hand, when you were leaving the box. I could al- most know what you were saying-ah! Mon Dieu! and I was so beautiful once--and am still, John Granme! Did you hear the applause to-night?" throwing up her arms, wildly. "I can make them come to my feet yet-as you shall come! You cannot help it. I have my certificate of marriage yet! I have never parted with it! I have waited, how have I not waited for this day!" "And you think your past life would entitle you to mike good this claim," he asked sneeringly, " if we were to venti- late the thing in court to-morrow? Do you think your im- maculate life would plead your cause, and make the bond secure?"     356         ATHOL,. "Good or bad, a man must take care of his wife X here," she said doggedly. "You shall notolet me starve-!" A "Hush!" he said sternly. '"You shall not call your-  self my wife again! The Little girl you saw with me to-  night will soon bear that name. She is pure and true, H and she loves me with a love passing the comprehension of your weak, perjured soul! She shall never see or hear of you. I will not pollute hzr innocent young life with la knowledge of you and your shame: After to-night you are never to come near me again. Go, Adele, and reap as you have sown the whirlwind!" "I reap the whirlwind? -and you--" "I defied& the world and Heaven once in loving you. I can do no more than defy the same power again. Go- I am resolved." "Then you renounce me to-night, utterly and flr- ever?"  "Utterly and -forever." "Oh, John," stammered the wretched woman, "y6u used not to be so hard! Only try me once again! OlIly give me a decent place to shelter me--only give me," and her voice dropped into Pitiful pleading again. " Only give me,a place to die. Oh, if I could tell you--if ybu only knew how I have struggled to barely live!"S he waited for him a moment to speak, but he only turned away from her burying his face on the table before him,  and she went on. "The last money you sent me I lost.  Then I found my way back to Duval's, but they told me there was nothing more for me-never would be anything more for me. Then I began searching for you. I looked for you far and wide. I went to Homburg, to all the 1od places, each step going lower and lower. Finally one cay I thought I'ld leave it all behind me and come out here. A lot of coryphles were about leaving. I joined them, and have danced here every weary night for many mont s. *^    '            I   ATHOI,.         357 But it has told on me, John. I have felt myself growing tweaker and weaker every day.' You saw how I fell, to- night, for though I've said to myself every week and month in the year, I shall see him again--yet, though I looked for it hourly, I was shocked when I saw you to-night. -to feel you so near me again-so near and yet so far." He put up his hand with a quick gesture of disgust, which she did not fail to perceive. "People talk," she said bitterly, " of how easy a thing it is to lead a pure, sinless life,---ah! you don't know the temptations I've had, John. Sometimes I think I might have been a good woman if I'd been brought up different- ly. t did not intend you any wrong. I was simply tempt- ed, and, like many another woman, I yielded-oh! bitterly have I been made to repent it. I told you I'd had hardly decent food or shelter since I came to New York. I've only a few pence in my pocket now. Some days I think I shall never live until the night comes around when I must crawl back to the miserable place, and dance my ghastly life away, and put on the old smile and abandon when my heart is just breaking!" Oh! how thin and wavering her voice sounded to me. If John had ever loved this woman once, how could he turn a deaf ear to the pitiful pleading of her voice! -If it were John pleading tlhus to me, I thought, though his soul were steeped in crime and sin, I could never turn away, never put him from ine. Yes, even then; though I knew he had deceived and wronged me and intended me yet deeper wrong, yet, even then-God forgive me- I loved him still! He could never have loved Adele this way I thought--but then perhaps a man is always just a little behind a woman in constancy, or self-sacrificing devotion. She seemed to have utterly forgotten all the fierce pur- pose with which she had confronted him. She only seemed now to be wandering back in thought to the happy time t           .      358         ATHOL. when he had loved her. And still John was silent, and still the pitiful, pleading voice sounded in my ears. "Oh! John, if you would only put your hand on my head. in the old way again--and call me Adele, as you used in the olden time-see, you were so fond of mr hair once--and I? I was proud of it too. It is the only hing about me not changed. It is soft, and yellow, and :urls still as you loved to see it-oh! John! only call me your wife once more, and I would be content to die!" He raised his head now and looked at her, and the heavy shadows darkened on his face as he looked. "I will give you money," he said in a hard, cruel voice; so hard and cruel that I scarcely recognized it as the same which had whispered to me in our last good- night, "my little wife, mvo own wife, soon to be." Thank God for that " soon to be!"Not yet! Not yet! I trem- bled in every limb as I listened to -his cold, dcliberate words. "I will give you money, the same as I would to any other suffering, sinful woman. I will see that you are decently cared for; but I'll acknowledge no tie between us, and after to-night--d you hear, Adele? you are never to see me again. When you want money I will give it to you. Here, even now." 'He took out his pocket-book, counting out notes, crisp bank notes. kSoon he would send her away,-soon he would come in and find me here -and what then? Yes, what then? Could I creep into his arms and lay my head upon his heart and feel that I was doing right in the sight of God as well as man I I had given him in my wild prodigality all of my heart-L-alas! I could not take it back; b t I could go away from him, hpm- bled, abased, and punished justly by Heaven for this all-ab- sorbing idolatry of my life.

I   ATHOL. ;        359 CHAPTER XXVIII. WHAT would I do? I did not know or care. I only felt I must go away. I dare not stay. Did he not say I was soon to be his wife? Hard and cruel I had seen him to-night. Did he love me so little he could do me this wrong; or so much that he dared any sin or crime? Ah! Heaven! what matter. I would go away. I went up to my own room very slowly. It seemed to take me so long to reach it. I stole in softly to see Harrie. She was sleeping very quietly. Dear Hal! 'What was I not leav- ing behind, and to what was I going forward? -But at that moment all I thought of was escape from John-es- cape from sin. I had nothing to pack up. I had nowhere to take it if I did pack it. I had no money. It was not a question with me-as with the poor wretch below-how to live, but how to die! Yet, I lingered over each trifling thing we had bought together, John and I, that very day. I took out my wedding-dress, folded so carefully in its tissue wrapping, lying in the box just as it had been sent home. I shook it out and held it to me before the mirror. Heavens! how like a shroud it hung in long, white, heavy folds! I let it fall from my hands quickly. Such .things were not for me. I took off my brooch and ear-rings-John's last gift. I slipped the rings from my fingers, but I could not part with the chains on my neck and arms. I had never taken them off since John had fastened them there, and the only trinkets I kept beside these was the little filagree     360         ATHOL. cross of my mother's, which she left me. This I fastened to my chain. I put on my dark, travelling dress, threw my long cloak about me, pulling the hood over my face, then turned to go-came back and took up a pencil and paper to say farewell to John. I could not go without that; but my hand shook so I could hardly guide the pencil. But I resolutely and rapidly wrote a few almost illegible words: "I am going away-do not try to find me," I wrote. "Oh! Johln, my darling, here end two such happy years. Here e ds also the happy lifetime I thought waiting in the future for me. If I did not love youI could not go away; but because I love you so much I must spare you the sin-" and then I pushed away the paper lest it should show the marks of my sudden, blind- ing tears. I had reaclted the door, when I came back and scrawled hastily, "Be kind to Adele. Oh! John,- if you had but told me all," =nd then I wrapped my cloak about me and walked swiftly down the echoing stairs. Unno- ticed, I passed among the crowd in the lower hall and about the door, and then I crept out tremblingly into the night-alone. I did not think where I should go. I only, walked rapidly on, like one bereft of all thought or care of self, not forming-any plans, but only losing myself in a dumb, horrible calm. I kept right on up Broadway, pass- ing group after group of gayly chatting people. Late as it was the streets were full, and carriages and omnibuses running still. All the places of amusement were out. I had no one to meet ar d recognize me, and yet I shrank from the crowd. I turred suddenly into one of the quiet, well-lighted side streets, where I met fewer people, walk- ing still with the same dumb lethargic despair, btt my brain reeling and whir ing giddily. Once or twice I was forced to cling to a railing for support, but on I went until the houses grew more few. Stores and wrehouses and great piles of lumber began to lift themselves before me.   AT'HOL.         361 All at once I came out in view of the river. It lay before me cool and dark, glassy and still, the twinkling lights from the opposite shore and passing boats striking bright gleams across. There was rest. I did not think of the great Hereafter. All religious thoughts had been with me mere impulses of the moment. I had never looked be- yond; I jad simply basked in the pleasures of the pres- ent all my life. I walked along the pier, creeping on one side upon some broken timbers, and sat down, looking over the edge of the wet, sodden planks, staring up and down, listening to the lapsing eddies swirling around the piles, wondering how long it would take to die, and if the horrible black pool would strangle me suddenly. It was only a moment, and yet I shrank from that one, wretched  instant, with my old earthly clinging. I shivered at the thought of the cold, cruel water swallowing me up---or would it dash me against the pier and buffet me with waves, or float me out to sea? What matter. I should not know anything about it, and I rose up, hovering over the edge, looking into the darkness, and dreading even the plunge. There was a sudden crash among the tim- bers, and a man leaped down, running toward me and throwing up his arms. I heard him say roughly, "Young woman, if you don't want to be taken off to the police-" I waited to hear no more, but with a shriek of terror I fled away, up the street, across, anywhere I flew, fear adding wings to my speed. And I never stopped until, panting and exhausted, I came out among houses and passing people again. And then wearily, how wearily I draggad along the pavement, with my brain throbbing and on fire, and my steps becoming slower and more feeble at each moment. Once a policeman spoke to me, but . quick- ened my pace without turning my head or noticing him. Suddenly it flashed through my torpid brain, "Would it end there?"Would I wander this way until taken by the t6     362-         ATHOL. I     ai! police to the station-house, to be found in the morning  and recognized by John? Oh! if I were only back to the hotel-but' no, there was Addele-and then I remem- I bered why I had left John and taken up this fearful wan- dering. What was he doing now? calmly resting? Thinking or dreaming of me? Where would it all end, and when morning came where was I to go? Just then I was pass-  ing a fine, large house, brilliantly lighted, with flaring lamps on each side of its open doors. Two or three young men were smoking ana talking noisily on the high stoop. From their voices I knew instinctively they had been drinking freely. One lahlghed loudly as I staggered and nearly fell in passing. My cheeks burned with fear. I walked on hurriedly as I could, looking back an i istant after. Three of them lwere running down the steps, arm in arm, hoarsely singing some fragment of rollicking song. They were coming tolwrd me, soon would be up to me- what should I do? Where turn for shelter? I looked across the street. A t11, dark building was opposite me, with court-yard and iroln gates standing open. "A prison . perhaps," I thought; but it was a shelter for the present, and I dashed across the street with my little remaining strength, down the steips, into the wide-flagged court, un- der the stone arches; and then as I heard the voices and laughter coming nearer and nearer, with a feeling that it was I they were pursuing, I dashed against the heavy door with wild frenzy, as if my feeble hands could force its ponderous locks. A11 at once I touched a bell, I pulled it, and it pealed long end loudly, as if the halls within were cavernous and em pty. T'hen in added terror I sank upon the damp storte flags. The voices were very near. Were they searching for me? Would they find me here? Wass no one coming? and rising I tried to find the bell again, but my limbs tottered, my head swam, and I sing myself for an instant, I fell heavily against the hard stone N\      C   ATHOL.          363 buttress of the wall. A few moments afterward I felt rather than saw the door slowly swing open, and some- body stooped, taking me up very tenderly. I opened my eyes. Two or three dark figures bent over me; the light from a suspended lamp struck upon their faces, which looked wan and spectral in the flaring light. I raised my- self quickly. Hlooked again. Horror of horrors! The soft brown eyes whose light I had watched slowly fade in dying; the mild, lustrous eyes of the dear sister dead and gone, the eyes of oer own Grace were looking into mine! The white, still face-the cerements'of the grave enfold- ing it--ah! well did I know it! Wasfit a tomb, or Heaven? or was the past all a bitter dream and I back in the old happy life at Brookdell? I stretched out my arms-I cried, ' Sister come to me--I am dying-take me to your heart again-do not leave me any more." And then I felt two cold hands laid gently on my burning brow in her old fond way, and I lapsed into total uncon- sciousness. It was very strange out of all this fearful wandering, this despair, this terror, to find when I opened my eyes that I'was alone again--that Grace had left me and I was floating out to sea. Not as I had thought I should float out a few hours before, tossed by the careless waves, a dead nothing, with no power 'or thought left-but alive, every nerve strained and yet death never so near! There was only one little plank for me to cling to, and I des- perately clutched it, as a drowning man is said to cling to a straw. On I floated, until the moaning of the breakers beyond the bar was dying faintly in the distance. There was not a light on all the sea or sky. Not even a single beacon in the great black dome above me-even God was against me, and every light in Heaven and on earth had been put out. Nothing before me but the black, pitiless sea, and the great whitei hills leaping around me. I     364         ATHOL. stretched out imploring arms to the dark inane. I called wildly for some one to save me and then the spar to w ich' I had clung was floating away. I leaped to grasp it, but the face of Adele looked mockingly at me over the waves as she bore it away. I heard her scornful laugh ripple back to me over the roar of the sea, and caught the flash of her twinkling feet as she danced like a wraith out of my sight. Then the great waves slowly parted and I begai to sink--down, down, into he deepest depths. A wild dles- pair took possession of my soul. I shrieked and shouted aloud for sister to come and help me-to come and save tie. Was it fancy, or did the soft " touch of a vanished hand " for an instant press mine? For an instant hold me closely and buoy me up? No, it was only fancy; for back I was swept into the wild surge of the sea again. I would escape from this dreadful doom. I would not,  could not die with those cold, glassy waves encompassing and pressing me down, down, until my senses reeled vith the never-ending falling. The swift descent, the dark- ness, the lingering suffocation became intolerable. I shrieked aloud, I tried td rise, to spring, to throw off the weight which enchained and dragged me down. And then there came a long blank, in which I was only conscious in a palsied, powerless. way of being carried, buoyed as it were, without volition of mind or body, up through the dark, tossing sea, and out upon the crests of great, sloping billows again. Always upon the water! Sometimes in storm, sometimes in cal , but always upon the water! Now tossed about and buffeted, the sport of every idle wind and wave, now rocking idly in delicious calm. And through it all, brown eyes, deep set, soft and tender, haunted me, afnd the touch of the " vanished hand " and the sound of the voice which I thought had been stilled forever.  And then suddenly the winter was ended, and the   ATHOL.          365 warm south winds began to blow. I felt its gentle breath upon my cheek. I felt day by day the sun growing warmer and warmer, sending the life-blood hotly through my veins. Nearer and nearer, fiercer and more burning, until it beat upon my whirling brain like streams of molten fire. Always floating just the same through it all! Always floating under the great, red ball, glaring down upon me like an evil eye of doom, searing my very brain, burning me up with intolerable pangs. Oh! for water-to be per- ishing upon it--dying of thirst-to feel that it floated around us everywhere, and never a drop to drink! It was a worse death than all others to die! And thenlike a vision of enchantment, a fair and stately island rose up like Venus from out the foam of the sea- slowly it rose, spread and widened and beyond it stretched and towered cool, ice-capped mountains, rising up before  ne like the fair 'Delectable Mountains," which the pilgrim Christian saw, and whiclirn blind gropings I had been trying to reach all my life. Nearer and nearer to it I came, until I could almost touch the verdure-fringed shores, almost feel the wind blowing among the groves, almost hear the cool plash and foam of the'stream trick- ling down the hillside and babbling under the tall, dark trees. Oh! for one dip of my hands into the cool, clear water, to feel it upon my burning face, to lay it upon my parched tongue. To lift up my eyes and see all this; to raise up feeble hands rnd try vainly to reach its ever-re- ceding shores; to long feverishly, wildly, for the cool gur- gle of the spring; to catch glimpses of sunshiny meadows, and know they were sweet with dewy clover blooms and scented grass, like the dear old meadows at the dell, "in the hot midsummer when the hay was down ;" to strive to reach this "( ignis fatuus," this delusion, this snare, and to find myself only rocking farther than ever away-rocking idly upon the waveless sea!     366         ATHOL. "It was horrible-a d I was so weak and feebl I could not raise a cry loud enough for those on land to hear. And all the time the sun stood high in the cl ar brazen heavens, and bear upon my throbbing brain. I  could feel the dull fire of renzy creeping slowly upon e.

But I was dyi g with a torpor and languor stealing over my senses, that was almost peace and rest. I was dying-but slowly--o slowly. I could still feel tie swaying of the sea-still h ar the smooth gliding 'of the water-still see, but indistinctly and with failing visioin, the green pastures and edwy upland, and the tricklirg mountain torrent with the shadows lurking upon it which I could not reach! And then, in that awful moment of waiting to be de- livered from the pangs of eath, i felt cool hands upoh my head, and saw again th dark eyes of Grace looking pitifully into mine.  Was this the Paradise, the mysterious tarrying-plac of the soul, which Geoffre had told me of? Had  gained it at last and found other, sister, friend again? "Do not leave me, dear sister," I whispered with fail- ing strength, "I have found ou now, and you must never leave me again. Tell me yo will never leave me again?"1 "Do you know me then, y child?" she whispered in her low soothing voice. "Ah! do I not?do I not?"  And I fell asleep with her hand in mine, and her pres- ence and touch bringing me. back again to the life I had felt I was so absolutely leaviAg. I must have slept a long time and had troubled visions in sleeping, for the horror, and darkness swept over me once more, and I lost the close clasp of tie dear hand and then "praying for this   ATHOL.          367 poor soul," I saw the hooded friars stand, telling their beads over again, as Longfellow sings it for us in the dying wail. of the "foolish, fond old year." But it was for me they were praying, not for the " desolate .old year," and for me they clasped their hands and cried "Kyrie, Eleyson! Christe Eleyson!"I turned my face away-opening my eyes-touching with a sort of wonder the cool, hard wall. I tried to raise my head but could not. I let my hands fall wearily before me, and as my eyes rested upon them I saw how wasted and thin they were, and how the blue veins throbbed under the transparent skin. Then there was a little white spread covering me which I noticed. It was in squares. I counted the threads with a childish persistency, and found there were thirteen one way-and I grew tired, and my heavy lids closed, while I was count- ing the other side. I must have slept very quietly, very peacefully, for I was vaguely conscious'I was no longer on the sea, and that, far away. and indistinct, I heard a soothing voice, lulling and calming me into slumbers not so deep but that I heard through it all a low passionate pleading, "O Clem- ens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria.'.' Gradually the words heard as in a dream became real- ity. Distinct and clear they forced themselves upon me. Prayer after prayer, invocation after invocations but words that I had never heard before. I closed myeyes and list- ening, Wondered if I were really back into dream-land again. And still the sweet, low voice went on praying to the "Mother of God, overflowing fountain of patience" to "obtain grace to mortify the rebellious senses, to avoid the occasion of sin, and to be ready to suffer everything rather than to offend God." The voice was almost like the one that hath soothed me in all my unrest. I opened my eyes suddenly and looked around. The window was open, the curtain just drawn aside. It was chilly, I thought,     368         A HOL. as I drew the covers more closely around me. The floor was bare. There was very little in the room except the cot on which I was lying, two chairs and a table. In ole corner hung a painted figure of Christ on the cross, and before it, in profoundest attitude of adoration knelt a woman, her black spare g rments falling plainly around her. I looked. I shut my eyes, then opened them again in sudden fright. It was no dream But where was I? Who was the kneeling figu re? and still I heard the peti- tions falling from her lips, and saw the beads astthey dropped one by one through her slender fingers. All the past fled away at once-thiP was reality. I tried to call, but the words died away i articulately, and I lay staring at her, trying with the little strength I had to raise myself. She' heard me, turned full a ound to look upon me, and then rising came to my bedside at once. stooping over me, and laying her hand upon my head. Instantly I recogl nized it-the touch of the slender fingers I had fel through all my feverish wanderings. qThey arranged the pillows under my head-they lightly touched my pulse they clasped my throbbing tand. Where am I?"I whisp ered, looking up and meetin the full, dark eyes, which were so very like the gentle eyes of the dear one gone before. "Safe," she answered smliling. "Safe and with me, my child. Do you know me noW?" I looked at her long and earnestly. It was a gentle, pale face, looking even more pale and wan with the folds of white lawn falling around it. But it was one never seen before! Once in a picture of the "Mater Dolo- rosa "I had caught such an expression, but never here, and yet strange as the face vas I trusted and loved it at once. I put out my hand and took hers. "I do not know you," I said. "I do not even know your name, or why I am here or where I am."   ATHOL.          369 "But you called me 'Sister,' and you wear a little cruz cifix.: Surely you belong to our faith, my child?" It flashed across me in an instant where I was-an instant of horror when I recalled the feeling with which I had been taught to regard these Sisters of Charity. :Then the next moment I was glad. Surely if ever a place was needed to hide from the -world, this was the spot. No place so secure, so safe, to enfold from prying eyes that which we wish hidden, as the all-embracing, mysterious arms of the great Catholic and Apostolic Church! I did not answer the Sister; I lay there thinking. Gradually it all came back to me-the night I left John-the long wandering up and down the streets-the fright-the faint- ness-the fatigue! "And how long had I lain here? "Five weeks," the Sister said. "I had been very ill--would be again if I I  talked--I must rest and avoid excitement." "Avoid excitement!" with my brain reeling, my whole soul resolved into one, wild longing to know of John.. "Come to me," I said, feebly calling her back, "only tell me one thing: Does any one know I am here-any one outside of these walls?" She shook her head. "And now not another word. After you have rested I will answer all your questions. Close your eyes now and try th sleep again." Shp walked to the window, closing it and dropping the curtain. I watched her as she took up a book and with bent head and instant attention was soon absorbed in its contents. Was she saying more prayers for me? She was very lovely, and saint-like and good, and her eyes and voice were so like Grace. I was very happy-more happy in feeling I was safe from John. I closed my eyes, and like a tired child lost myself in dreams again. I6* P      370 ,        ATHOL. CHAPTER XXIX. THAT night when the Sister was sitting by my bedside, I laid my hand in hers, and Whispered out the story of my love and John's great wrong. She heard me through without interrupting me. "You shall remain here wits- me," she said when my confession was ended. "The Church has taken you in and hereafter we shall claim you as our own," and then she went'on to tell me where I was, and how she had- found me that night laying unconscious at the gate of the con- vent. She was a Sister of Charity. Her name " in re- ligion "Sister Angelique. It was she who had taken almost exclusive charge of me, and henceforward she should in the name of the Church claim me. If I .wished repose and peace, as well as concealment from the world, I could find it here. And then she went on to paint all the hap- piness the pure holy calling of a Sister gave. And I list- ened to her with a weak, rapt attention and wondering awe, longing for the same clear, steady faith, and promis- ing her even then, that I would follow any path in the fu- ture she would lead me.         X , And thus I came to life again. Slowly and with many a lapse and many a dream between-slowly the unrest and fever pain languished, and at last died away altogether. Slowly-very slowly-like a child in the dawn of awak- ening intellect, did I come back and take up my life again. And through it all Angelique never wearied or- relaxed her kind attention. All through that long con-   ATHO)L.          71 valescence she cared for me, though all the Sisters were kind and even the Lady Superior came to see me,'full of gentle dignity and sympathy. But I liked none of them so well as "Sister Angelique." From the first moment of my recollection coming back to me, her face was the one I recognized and loved, as my only distinct remembrance through the black void of the past. Now, cut off from all knowledge of the world and my former friends--feeling my past life almost as it were a dream, I began to bu ild4 up for myself another future,. in 'which sle was the sole hope to cling to. She used to sit by my bedside and read to me, from her missal-and indeed from every book which her duty and religion taught her was proper food for my weak and unformed mind. And then she would leave me to meditate on what she had been read- ing, until I longed for her to come back and teach me I again. And when I woke there were always the serene eyes of the "Mary Mother," looking down upon me--wherever I looked I met them, on the suspended crucifix, before which Angelique so often prostrated herself-was it any wonder that after a time all these things seemed beautiful, natural and right to me? She seemed to know intuitively how to plant seed upon the willing soil, for whenever she would close her book, she would skilfully continue the train of thought which the author advanced-telling me in a low, earnest voice, which l-trengthened as she went on, of the repose and peace to be found in a life wholly dedicated to God, as the life !of a Sister must be. She began with tht beautiful story of the cross and passion, the great scheme of mnan's redenp- tion, the self-denial, the penance, the suffering and atone- ment for us. The Holy Mother's pure life .and patieqt grief, and she spoke of the great Churchl founded and re- deemed by blood, with a tender, passiohate love and loy-     372          ATHOL. alty, the depth of which I had never imagined before. Like that Holy Mother did the Church stand-sublime, great, exalted, with her arms like a shield about every loving child of hers--always a sure -protection, always a blessed rest. And then in words of vivid eloquence, which thrilled me with terror as I listened, she painted all the horror and punishment of heresy-all the torment of a lost soul, if it rejected this great salvation so freely offered to all. It was seldom, however, she talked to me thus. I was oftenest in words of infinite tenderness that she sought to turn my heart to the quiet of the pure life she was as: siduously teaching me to love.          1 "It was a worthless thing," I argued, "to dedicate to God and the Church a life which was onlyogiven be- cause of the disappointment of the world. And perhaps I might weary of it," I said. "I might after a time regre; the step taken." And she answered me I could not be- come a nun until I had been a " lay member " for an ap- pointed time, and until their spiritual director as well as reverend Mothei was satisfied of my willingness to accept a life of renunciation and utter self-abnegation; and one was never accepted until their entire fitness for such a life . was proven. There was a six months' probation upon enter. ing a convent, and if satisfactorily completed, there was a two years' novitiate to pass through; and- at the end of that two years and a half, one was as free to change their mind and return to the world as they were before the pro- bation began. "But," she would say, " if after that test you will love it as I know you will, then indeed there must be no looking back; then indeed you -are to crucify the! world, and all worldly longings. You are to exclude every sectional interest; you are to take up the cross, and in! imitation of the ascended Victor, bear it awhile, until it please Him to exchange the heavy burden for the crown. There is not among us," she would tell me, " one sigh of O   ATHOL.          373 regret ifr the unholy -world we have left behinid-all other lights except that which shines around the Cross of Christ are forgotten--there the transcendent glory ever falls. And it was needful," kissing the crucifix, "C always to have that emblem before our eyes, lest by any chance we forget we are bearing it ourselves." It had helped her bear such bitter woes; it .had turned her soul aside from shipwreck and despair and everlasting death. Oh! if I would only freely take up the same life ; if I would only teach my untried feet the same path; if I would give myself up wholly to God and the Church, how certain and sure the peace for which I was longing would come. I would listen to her very calmly, very confidingly, and promise her again and again I would love the Church, if only for her sake, and try and make its principles and precepts my own;; but all religion was a mere germ with me. I could no more give myself up to unlimited faith in the doctrines of Rome than I could heretofore accept the belief of Calvin, or the certainty of the Episcopacy and the Apostolic succession. It was very little wonder if my ideas of theology were somewhat confused; "but I will try it,"' I said with my usual recklessness. Brought up strictly in the kirk and ending in a convent! At least I could not accuse myself of illiberalism! And it will be strange, I thought, if my soul cannot find some mooring in all these different seas I have sailed upon. And I did as the Sister bade me. I tried it in faith,'but I don't think, even in my wildest longings for a saintship, I don't think I was ever intended to be a .religieuse. Sometimnes over a book and beads, and with Angelique's ready in- struction still sounding in my ears, I caught myself long- ing for a glimpse of the world again. Oh! only once more to hear Hal's laugh and jest-only once more to be in the dear old home--only once more to feel John's arms about me. But that was sinful, the Sister said, and I X, .      374         ATHOL. steeled my heart against such cravings, and sickened and longed yet more, in spite of my effort. When I grew well enough to' creep feebly about my room, then up aAn'lown stairs, and finally into the small but beautiful garden, with its boundary of high fall, this longing grew more intense. And just because I tried to put itfrom my heart, I found myself yearning for it more and more. For at length I wearied of the dull, monoto- nous round of duties, the atmosphere of rigid piety, the dreary self-denial. I longed to run away and be wicked! It was such a mockery and lie that life was a pleasure to  any of them. Sometimes I wondered, as I looked at th  placid, mute faces, bound and swathed as if for the tomb, if under all this mask their hearts were not bounding a tumultuously and fiercely as mine. Some took up the cross from choice, I knew, and pure religious zeal; An- gelique was of this number, but there were more who did it from very weariness of the battle of life. If I finally became one of them, it would only be because I had nowhere else to go, and I was weary of the world and myself already. So passed the dreary time. Day after day, week afte week, month after month-what would I do when Ibegan to count off the years? What a hard, mechanical puppet would I have become in that time? Six months went bk of the same never-varying monotony. Six months I watched the dull round of duties imposed, bearing wit- me always my heavy, heavy cross of loneliness, self-de- nial and mental torture, until I thought I could endure It no longer. The whole dar apparently Was made up of services- and prayers. The little, silver-toned bell in the chapel tower seemed always to be ringing. Matin, and Vesper, and Saint's-day services-oh! how I wearied of it. *  I spent all my leisure tim in the narrow window of iry cell, looking out over the usy streets praying like Phila-   ATHOL.          375 mon, "Lord turn away mine eyes from temptation," and, like him, "looking nevertheless!" Every passer-by, no matter how distant, I watched eagerly, striving to catch a glimpse of his face, longing and yet dreading. to see one I knew. And as the time dragged heavily by, passing into months and seasons, and yet no news of him, I longed to die and put it 11 away from me. But even if I had seen him, I would have shrunk from his sight. I shrunk from going out into the unquiet streets, fearing I might meet the face I still loved, yet dreaded-one that would never give up searching for me, I knew. "He would never dream of looking for me here," I thought with triu!ph. Within these walls 1 was safe, from discovery at least;; but oh! the slow, wearying torture, would it ever end? But concealed in the dress of the novitiate, walking with downcast head by Angelique's side, I at length ven- tured out beyond the convent walls. Oh! what a joy it seemed to leave the gates behind us, and although we only went through a crowded, filthy street to pay a visit of mercy to a sick and suffering pensioner of the Church, yet never before had tlW world looked more alluring, and never did I long with a more unutterable longing to be out and 'free again. I was free-would be free for two years-and yet I did not dare throw off the present security. Where would I turn my steps if I did go? Not back to John again?-oh! no. Never that! This was Fate, perhaps Providence, which had guided me to those silent walls that one dark night of my life, and I reso- lutely turned again to the religious duties the Sister allotted me, and tried to find peace in rigid conform- ity. , But I grew very weary of life, and, like Pharaoh, hardened my heart more and more. But through it all, like, a ray of brightest light on a dark and chilly spot, like an oasis in a desert, like a shadow of a great rock. in a weary land, grew up and fl urished my love for Angelique.   ,.                '     376         : ATHOL.  And although she woul'd not allow an earthly love to hin- der or clog our heavenly aspirations, I knew the life she had saved was dear to her heart as she would allow any-.. thing earthly to be.       ' But how' my soul sickened in all this time to hear of John! So many months to live without him! How could  I have borne it? Ard yet I was to teach my heart not only to live months and years, but a lifetime withouit him! Oh! cruel task. To itear as it were my living heart out ! and cast it from me-!               ! One day the Sister and I, taking a much longer line of  duty than usual, found ourselves on Broadway. Before I was at all aware of it we were passing the theatre where ii I had seen Adele. I hardly dared trust myself withl more than a hurried glance; but I saw no longer the name of i "Millie Marie " in large conspicuous letters, although the same play was'advertised. Where then was she? Had  she fulfilled her threat and followed John? And in pass. ing the hotel where we had staid together, John, Hal and I, how it brought all the past back to me, and howl longed to look up and search the faces gathered on the steps and in the windows. But I did not dare. I bent my head and walked Swiftly forward by the Sister's side, and never felt out of danger until we were blocks away. Every time we came to a place where bills were Eosted, however, I would run quickly over the announcements of the play, to see if I might somewhere find the namel of the poor ballet-dancer who had wrought me so much sorrow. But I could not find it. If only I could see the papers -and then I wondered if John had advertised for rme-if he had tried to reach me through the column of "Per- sonals," which dear old Hal had been so fond of. over- looking. Oh! for news-'for news of home! One day Angelique unfolded before me a new plan. She had long thought of it and felt it was her duty; but *             1.Y   ATHOL.  AArot. t    3" now she was decided. She should join a band of nurses going out to one of the Virginia hospitals. Would I go, too? or would I prefer to stay here alone? The war! 'I had hardly thought of it since I had prisoned myself within these walls-the cruel, wicked war! Were it not for that, Gepffrey had been alive to-day and I should not be here, forsaken of God and Heaven! And what would I do in the hospital? I who knew nothing',of sickness or death, or of the care which the wounded and dying should receive? I who had no faith, or creed, or hope, to care for the souls as well as the bodies of these men who werb fighting so courageously "down there," the Sisters told me,-who were perishing of hunger, disease and lack of care-oh! no. I had no heart any longer in this war-! I only loved the country, the flag and the army because John had loved it! What was it all to me? What did I care if they all perished to-morrow? I would not put out a finger to save either side. And yet-what would I do alone? How live with- out Angelique-the one I clung to now above all else in the world?  If She left me-oh! Hell itself were not so wide and deep and dark as these gloomy walls! I gave her no answer. I only felftthat every hope and comfort was swept out of my life, as it had always been before. I loathed the dreary mockery of religion which I was daily practicing, but yet more did I loathe and dread the loneliness and despair of my life here, without Angelique's presence and-steady faith and support. I put on my shawl and bonnet and went out-went out without a definite purpose-wanting only change--some- thing to vary this horrible monotony which was killing me. I walked into the cool, quiet street, with a vague un' certain longing filling my heart, trying to calm myself and form some positive plan for the future. I walked slowly along, turning up streets and avenues     378        t ATHOL. without a thought as to where I was going or when I should retrace my steps, when I came suddenly out on Broadway. There were no omnibuses or carriages run- ning and it looked so strangely, lined 'as .it was on each side with crowds of talking, expectant people, that invol- untarily I stopped to s e the cause of the unusual excite- ment. Just then an o nibus attempting to drive up was turned into a side street by several policemen, and push- ing forward to the curb, I looked with the rest. Just where Broadway turns, up near Grace Church, I de cried a tumultuous, moving mass. I looked and looked, and as it slowly advanced it resolved itself into a mighty li e of soldiery, cavalry as well as infantry. Then as it came nearer and nearer I saw the long line of police, dressed in their uniform of plain blue, marching evenly and erect, and following them the band playing gayly of Dixie. And beyond it all as far as eye could reach, one long-continuous gleam of blue and gold, waving plumes, glittering steel and fluttering flags. On they came-the heavy, measured tread of resolute feet beating, beating, beating, like the waves upon the shore, and as they came gallantly forward, with their long, even tramp, the great heart and voice of the people woke. It was first a murmur, then a shout, and  gathering strength as i passed down the street, it became  one continuous roar, and cheer after cheer, wild and pro- longed, broke from the waiting crowd. It was the great, united, approving voice of a thoroughly roused pe ple  "Vox populi, vox Dei," I thought as I listened to the wild cheers, saw bouquets tossed to the brave, armed men, saw windows, balconies and house-tops crowded to ove flow- ing, white hands and handkerchiefs waving, banners flung to the breeze, and -all that indescribable enthusiasm and furore, which'only those who witnessed it at that time can understand.  "It was a Regiment of infantry from Maine," tome I\CSIIICLL V1IldIL i LIII   ATHOL.          379 nan said near me to a friend; most of them lumbermen ,nd woodsmen from that vigorous, hardy State. In later lays we have sung a little campaign refrain of "Oh! have you heard the news from Maine?" In good truth we might have sung it then! Great, talwart men, they were who went tramping past us, with L stride as free and easy as if they were bearing their ;uns on a hunting expedition, through their own native brests. But there was resolute resolve on all their sturdy, veather-beaten faces, though the pang of parting yet ingered there. Then a few straggling boys and women closed in after hem; then more music, more banners, and then again ile after file of men, foreigners, mostly Germans, with :heir slouching Garibaldi hats and drooping feathers. rhese men, with the impulsiveness of their race, had taken ip arms too in defence of their adopted country, and with :hem marched along many a wife and mother, holding fast ;o the arm, sometimes even to the skirts of the husband or son-perhaps lover-lingering over the parting, and wearing even in their sorrow a look of proud defiance which was quite touching to behold. Side by side with two of the officers stalked a tall vivandiere, gayly dressed, with her canteen slung over her shoulder, walking with a stride and bearing worthy a Grenadier, and wearing a pair of enormous Hessian boots. "Got in Himel!" profanely said an enthusiastic Teuton near me, " what a leg she has!" and he clapped his hands, bellowing cheers of delight, until she was lost to view in the crowd. I could have laughed even then, as I sometimes laugh now, when I think of those enormous boots, only it was so terribly ear- nest, and death was such a real thing, that even the vivan- diere seemed solemn to me.     380         ATHOL. Still they caome gallantly on, with their incessant, even tramp, the sunlight gayly flashing back the gleam of their bayonets, shining on the gorgeous crimson dress of the free--stepping Zouave, and wrapping banners and blades and gaudy war-panolly in a flood of waving light. At that moment a voice in the ranks began a wild clhant of "Marching Along." It flew from man to man ; it was caught up file by file ; it'swelled to a shout; it rolled re- luent along, drowning all other sounds in song. The air rung with the words, I' For God and our country We'll go  marching along," from the strong chests of the censely packed mass. Down the street they passed, and as they  raised the refrain, the shouts became louder,ladies leaned from the balconies and windows, white hands were kissed  and waved, heads bared, flags waved. The crowds on the  sidewalks caught up the shout, and the chorus lecame one long, deafening roar, pealing to the skies, " while for God and their country they went marching along." All at once I caught sight o.- a figure I knew full well. Riding at the head of his regiment, towering above the crowd, rugged, stalwart, erect, reining in the pawing, disdainful Hector, with a firm, controlling hand-the grand, proud head thrown back, defiant and courageous as of old". Ah! my God! where then 'was my strength? I watched him riding slowly 'on, past me. I co ld al- most have put out my hand and stopped him, but I Qmoth- ered the cry that was in my heart! I only stood still, clasping my hands cl sely, closely straining my ekes to catch every movement of the retreating figure. He had grown thinner since I law him last; thinner and a shade paler ; but the firm set mouth and rigid, fixed look that he wore the night he said, "He for one would go boldly for- ward to solve the pro lem of liberty or death," was there still. I pressed forwa d trying to keep him in view, but I could not make my way through the crowd. Helplissly I   ATHOL.         381 clung to a lamp-post, and raising myself as well as I was able, watched the tall, erect rider, until the surging crowd suddenly swallowed him up. And then, in a weary, be- wildered way, with a dull heavy pain at my heart which seemed to keep time to the measured tread of the march- ing feet, I saw the great solid masses of, armed, men pass glittering along, but they seemed far away, and indistinct- ly seen as in a dream, and the roar of the crowd came back to me thickly muffled and dim. I leaned heavily against the post to which I had been clinging, watching vacantly until the last man had disappeared. No one no- ticed me--the wild, huzzaing crowd in which I was lost, the troops of mad, exultant people, hoarsely singing out their triumph and joy. "Where are those regiments going to?"I asked touching the arm of a decently clad man near me. He gave one glance at my dress. "It is very clear you don't read the 'Tribune,' Miss, or you'd know they were "On to Richmond." I never answered, never thanked him-"On to Rich- mond '"-that meant on to danger, defeat, death-I knew the cry! How much nearer were they to Richmond than they were that first battle summer?-And how many dead, white faces, lay staring blankly under the South- ern sky-strewing-no-paving the way for a fresh army to walk over and die as they had died? How long could it go-on? Oh! if Richmond were ever taken, over what hecatombs the triumphing army would make its way! 'Then I turned homeward, walking feebly I knew, with a great sense of woe and want falling upon me. Alone! God only knew how truly alone, and the song Geoffrey used to sing in the bygone days, came whispering itself over and over again in my heart- ".-.For men musL work and women must weep, And the sooner it's over, the sooner to sleep-"     332         AATHOL.  Somehow the words comforted me. There was rest in such sleep even for one so young as H-a sleep I cov-  eted then and dumbly prayed for. And walking home- ward slowly, with throbbing brain and dimmed eyes, feel- ing almost that I was living in a wild, strange dream, from M which I would never waken, I made up my mind to go with *Angelique.             i        X So that night when the moon came up, pale and lumi- I nous, and lay with a great flood of light on the bare, white floor, of the Sister's cell, I went in softly, going up to where she sat in the window, leaning on her clasped d hands, in her old, patient, wailing attitude--crept tip to her and put her unresisting arms about me.      ! "I am going with you," .I said, " going to the hosFitals. I have no one but you noW in the wide world," and some- , how, oddly enough, I whisiered to her the old love song  of Ruth to Naomi, forgetting for the moment that, heretic and hypocrite, I had no part or, lot with her; that a gulf, great and wide, separated fus that my feeble faith could never bridge over or cross. But, hand in hand, with heart and faith and purpose widely parted, we two that night made up our plans for the. future. The Sister, intent, alert, watchful, with a great purpose in her heart and work before her, and prayer on her lips I and I, only feeling myself more than ever an outca st a mere waif on the stream of Time. *    'S ' Ei   ATHOL.         383 CHAPTER XXX. IN a few days we set off. Only four of the Sisters ac- companied us. We were to go to some place near Win- chester, Angelique said. It mattered very little to me where, so only I could be with the great Army of the Re- public. "On to Richmond!" the strange mar had said that day in the streets. "Was Winchester anywhere near Richmond?"I asked, longing eagerly to be there. It seems like a dream to me sometimes, that journey, the reaching the hospital at night, the crowded, wards, the loathsome sights, the sickening sense of horror which abode with me continually. I could not rest until I had gone all over the place, searching every face with a bitter, wild fear, that the one for which I was looking was already lost to me forever! But though the wards were always full, no familiar face met mine. Every time a fresh ambu- lance would lumber slowly up to the door and discharge its suffering freight, I would look eagerly; but ah! me, I was always looking in vain. I could not even find any one who had ever heard of the regiment or its colonel. I ha(d not the most remote idea where they were stationed, or if they were in active service. I had merely read the number on the banners and caps, and knew they were Massachusetts volunteers. And all mly soul went out into anxious questioning with every fresh arrival. One day JI was rewarded. There had been a sharp but short en- gagement in the Shenandoah valley, and the Union forces repulsed with great slaughter. And then toward nightfall     384         ATHOL. the old frightful routine began again. Ambulances came slowly rumbling up to he door, and again the wards were filled with groaning, pain-racked men. It was eary, ghastly work, but it was work, and I bent every nerve to the task. I gave myself up to it willingly, for I had come to understand in a p rplexed kind of way the feeling which animated these men, and gave them courage and patience under so mu h suffering and disappointment. But I did not wonder that sometimes the poor fe lows should, in the bitternes- of their hearts, feel this fair fer- tile Shenandoah, to be indeed as they called it, a "Valley of Humiliation" to then. For it had merited the name from repeated and bitte losses to contend with as well as the wary and subtle foe. Among the wounded brought in that night w s a soldier, a mere boy, witt a face like that Of which Mrs. Browning wrote, "youn and pathetic with dying."\ His right arm Had been amp tated, and a low, nervous fever followed, during whichI nursed him assiduously, f r I liked the lad. I attache myself to his bedside at o ce. Most of the men were r ugh, hardened fellows, but this one was gentle and delicate as a girl. All through his long, wearisome illness, h was never fretful or impatient, like most of them. And when he was sufficiently recov- ered I led him to talk f the army, the different regi- ments, and the late battle . "Were the Ninth Massachu- setts Volunteers engaged?"I asked tremulously. "Ys, he remembered the regiment, he knew the colonel's name, he was sure it was Graem, a brave man he was too, and fought like one possessed of a demon," he said. "W as he wounded?" hanging ipon his words as if he were about to pronounce my oom. "Oh!' no! he saw him marching off after the bat le was done and bearing with -him a drummer boy who lad been left to die alone and unnoticed on the field."   ATHO,.         3S5 "That was like John," I thought; "so like him," with thrill of pride as the young soldier went on to tell me ore of that lost day, pointing to his poor amputated rm, and then the tears would fill his eyes and he would lk of home, and his mother, and his longing to get back the pleasant old farm once more-ah! how I liked this y! How glad I would be, if in caring so tenderly for m, I could bring him back to life and strength again. hen too he had seen John-he had fought near him-he  ad told me of his safety-he had given tne the latest ews of home. He was the link between me and the ne whom I still loved with such wild, sinful idolatry. 'I was never constant in efforts before, I was then. It ,emed to me I must save the life which had brought me  ich good tidings of joy. Many and many a message of love anid thankfulness  id I get from the 'old mother, down on the western farm, atiently praying for the life of her youngest boy. Iie as the youngest of five, he said-all in the army too-  ith a flush of honest pride on his pale cheeks. That  as the way Ohio men and women did their duty to God  nd their native land! Well-it is a very brave thing, no oubt, to teach infant lips to "speak plain the word 3untry;" but ah! me, to sit desolate-what woman's eart can beat on in patriotism and strength, knowing her earer life is blotted out and spent?-ah! there's the :ing-to sit desolate! The poor old mother-I hoped er son would get well, but the youngest of five, the Ben- amin of the flock, seemed slowly fading away. Day by ay we noted the failing strength-the brightness of ie eye, the deepening flush on the sunken cheek, the asted figure, the almost childish clinging to us for every Livial want. Angelique soon learned to love the boy, as i! he called him, as much as I, and many a night found us to-  ether bending over his couch. He had been brought up  17     386         A HOL. a Methodist, which was so ething I knew nothing about; but if all Methodists were gentle and pure in their faith as this boy, then religion was something more thana  mere name, or an impulse, with them, I was sure. I had some vague ideas of the )rawling worship of the back woods, from seeing it dev loped down here, among th. "poor whites," and in the A ican element around us; but this boy knew such swee spiritual songs, and talked  so clearly of life and deat , that involuntarily I became  taught instead of teaching. I had so absolutely nothing  to teach, and so very, very much to learn. It is true  wore the rosary and said mn prayers mechanically as th;  rubric and the Sister taught me; but it was a cold, barren formula for me to repeat, o I said nothing at all about I religion to any of them, except they first spoke of it tc me. Most of the men were Protestants, and many of  them had Bibles or Prayer Books of their own, and I was  always glad when I was asked to read to them. It seemed  to me like home, to repeat the prayers I had heard fall- ing from Guy's lips so ofte when sister was ill, and we were gathered together around her bedside. I liked to  read them over so much, and Angelique did not forbid me. She had come out here fron pure longing to help save these soldiers' lives-lives so needful and precious to the heart of the country. It was not a question of faith, nor a time to quarrel over theological differences-it was only to care for the. sick and wounded and dying; to point the way to Heaven if need be, but not to exact obedience and  conformity to the rules of the Church as a reward for ser-  vices rendered. Beside, the Sisters all knew I was waver-- ing-that I really was like one groping blindfolded and  in the dark, and they. hoped by patient waiting and holy example to claim me as their own. I said nothing to any  of them of the bitter needs of my soul, or of the home- sickness which was increasifg with every added day of   ATHOL.         387 my life. Outwardly I had already learned to be as calm as they were, and I moved among them quietly, and rigid- ly bent upon fulfilling my round of duties, but with no in- terest or heart in anything, except the little that I gave to the wounded Ohio boy.  Many and many a battle was fought, many a day lost and won, while we tarried within those old walls. I for- got to count time, as heretofore, by days. I let it pass by without caring for the weeks or months. I only knew life was a hopeless mockery to me, and I felt the passing sea sons long drawn out and never ending, as if they were years, only conscious through it all of trying to live with- out John-was not that enough? The summer waned and ended. The conflict deepen- ed day by day. Like the waves of a mighty sea, the army advanced, then retreated. We listened to the faint mur- mur of the living tide as it rose and fell, surging around us wildly, then falling back again into stillness, and went on doing our never-ceasing work, trying to carry about with us some of the courage and patriotism of these men, who in winter's cold or summer sun, fought stubbornly on, all the same. But it was a weary, weary task, and I sickened and yearned for news of John, until sometimes I felt I would be glad to die and put it all away from me. It was on the nineteenth of September-I am sure I can never forget the day-that the last battle of Winchester was fought, and the keynote of complete victory in the fu- ture, sounded by the fearless and gallant Sheridan. We knew they were meditating another attack. The day be- fore-Sunday-we saw them filing down in the valley, their baggage wagons and artillery following, the various Divis- ion, Brigade and Regimental banners flaunting gayly in the sunlight; a grand army, powerful and vast, it seemed to me, as I stood watching them from my window. We also knew that Early had sent Gordon's detachment of rebel in-     388         ATHOL.  fantry from Bunker Hill, where it had been stationed for a few days past, with orders to drive Averill out of Martins! burg and destroy the bridges on the Baltimore and Ohid Railroad across the Opeq an, which they erroneously thought had been repaired. They occupied Martinsburg for a short time only, withqut doing any damage'to thd railroad, and were eventually driven by Averill as far as Darkesville. General Sheri dan, learning their movements,  ordered the whole commanc to break camp and prepare : to march; and at three o'clock on Sunday tents were  struck and the different divisions were all under arms, and Si prepared to move at a inomnnt's notice, and remained in  this state of readiness for an hour or more, when there came another order to go into camp for the night, and everything went back into its old quiet again. That night I could not sleep even for an hour. A dim  foreboding haunted my soul and troubled my dreams if I but lost myself in a moment's rest. Long before the  breaking of the day, Irose and went out into the grounds,  to breathe the fresh air and cool my burning head. A strange dead silence lay upor everything in the house and around me. I walked to th wooden paling which sur- rounded us, and sat down or a little garden bench some I of the men had placed there. The mists lay cool and  white in the valley, and there was not a sound to mar the perfect hush of nature. I leaned my head upon the rough fence, feeling no fear at being there alone. Wrapped in thought, and weighed down with the unutterable silence of the passing night, I sat there waiting the coming of the  dawn, as many another soul like mine waited, longing for  the shadows to flee away and the glad light of a never i ending day to break for thenm. And, sitting there a solitary dreamer, f presently be- came conscious of a far-away, rumbling sound, like the first faint mutterings of a co ing storm. I raised my head   ATEIOL.         389 and listened eagerly. Faint at first, so faint that I had heard it some time in an unconscious kind of way without regarding it at all, it began to creep nearer and nearer, nearer and nearer, until I knew it to be the steady, contin- uous tramp of armed men up the road. They were march- ing on the Bergville and Winchester pike. Who was it? Early or Sheridan? The mists were slowly curling up the valley, and the first faint streaks of coming dawn were piercing the gloom. I could not see a thing, but all the time nearer, and nearer, crept towards us this muffled, dis- tinct tramp, beating regularly and evenly, like the long, steady booming of waves upon the shore. I was too frightened to stay alone there any longer, and turning away ran hastily up to the house. Just as I reached the door I noticed an old gray-haired soldier sitting by the wall, leaning on his crutch, his head bent forward, his whole soul seemingly absorbed, as mine had been, in lis- tening. He looked up saying " good-morning," ,then touching me with a detaining hand: "There'll be heavy work before nightfall, Miss." It seemed so strange that no one ever called me "Sis- ter" like the others. Even to these men for whom I worked, I was simply "Miss; " or sometimes in a kindly, grateful mood, some man, who doubtless had daughters of my own age at home, wo uld call me "daughter," or "child." It was only to the Sisters and to Angelique, that I bore the name which she had chosen for me "in relig- ion," Theodora-gift of God--a sweet and tender name  falling so solemnly from her lips-ah! could I ever be a "gift of Gqd" to any one?-more than all to her?-  I turned back and leaned over the old soldier. "Is it Early?"I asked un'der my breath. "Is it the rebel army we hear coming up the road?" "No, child. Our men were to break camp at three this morning,'and I came out to watch and listen. I could     390         ATIOr. . not sleep. You must not be frightened," as I drew nearer  to him. "Frightened? and Sheridan there?"And I lifted my head and looked down the road with a sudden sense of pride and security. "But I would like to see them-will - they pass this way? Will you go with me down to the I gates?"  "You are a good girli aid quickly, as I placed the! crutch under his arm. is h I might see Sheridan I   once more-I was wittihiii::you know when I lost my limb." And-then he begaani with the garrulity of a con-' valescent, to tell me over again as he had often done be- ? fore, of the desperate fightirg he had seen. He was an  old man, far too old to do much service in this war, and  yet he had resolutely answered the first call; ay, and  fought too they all said, but that was past and he was now i a cripple for the rest of his life. Poor old man! That- crutch was his cross of the Legion of Honor. I led him to the bench I had so lately left, and sat  down by his side, listening to him, yet hearing through it  all the steady tramp on the pike. And while we were talking, the mists floated away and in the faint cool gray  of the early morning, we saw them filing along the road, the Sixth Corps leading the way. The brave old corps! The "Bloody Sixth," as they were always called down  here, marching evenly and rderly in two parallel col- umns both sides of the road, with all their artillery, am- munition and supply trains vith them, the Nineteenth Corps following in similar ordter. The old soldier bared his head - he forgdt his age,e his gray hair, maimed  limb-he only felt again with bounding pulse the old firm trust in his young command r revive. He waved his cap-he leaned over the gatewAy feebly calling out, "Vic- tory and Sheridan-" but his voice was drowned in the steady fall of marching feet an the rumble of artillery. I          I  E-   ATHOL.         391 And then to the right of the Nineteenth Corps, we saw the army of Western Virginia under General Crook, slowly massing and settling down, and in the gray dis- tance we could plainly see him riding along thelines, while at Sight of the gallant figure the men broke out into wild, vociferous cheers, promising to " go in and wipe out Winchester." And clear and refluent his voice rang down the ranks, cheering and encouraging them on-ah! a gal- laht, noble figure, lie seemed to me, sitting erect and firmly upon his prancing steed, riding slowly and proudly along the lines-and then suddenly the whole vast army seemed lost and swallowed up in a thick cloud of smoke, and through it we heard faintly and from afar the bugles of the cavalry ringing out the " charge," and ebbing and surging, coming nearer and then dying away, the tumult and roar of battle; and when the dawn had slowly widened into day, the sun was dimmed and the air heavy with clouds of battle-smoke, and full of distant cries and screaming shot and bursting shell, until the noises became fainter and fainter, finally dying away altogether, and we could see nothing or hear nothing; and I wandered about restlessly and aimlessly in the different wards, wondering with breathless expectancy what it all meant, until about nine o'clock when it began again; first between Opequan and Winchester, where our cavalry under Averill and Merritt were engaged with Breckenridge's Corps, and then roaring around us apparently on every side, though we could see nothing, and did nIot know until nightfall how the enemy fled, Sheridan pursuing, driving them through Winchester like sheep, capturing twenty-five hundred prisoners, with artillery and'numberless battle- flags, until under cover of the darkness they fled up the valley. It was here General Crook and his men, who fought magnificently, distinguished themselves. He led them personally, cheering them along and filling them with     392         ATHOL. the wildest enthusiasm and courage by his own intrepid bravery. He seemed that day to lead a charmed life. Everywhere, where the fight w4xed hottest, where the shot  and shell fell thickest, he was seen urging on his men, and though balls fell around him like hail, he passed through the fiery ordeal unscathed. All the world knows the story by heart now, and th- army of Western Virginia, with its gallant leader, will be remembered as long as his- tory is read, and freedom and love of country reverenced. The old soldier was right. We were making our history hand over hand now, and the last battle of Winchester is one of the greatest triumphs and glories of the past. That night the telegram flashed the news to Washington, and before another dawning the whole country knew through Sheridan's unostentatious report, that " to Generals Wright X Crook, Emory and Torbett, the north was indebted for this splendid victory." Not a word of his own services-but, what need?-a woman's pen is far too weak and powerless to recapitulate all the great wDrk he had done; but when- ever I hear the name of Sheridan and his generals, how my heart swells with pride, a d how suddenly the mists  that have gathered around t4at time flee away, as they fled in the cool gray dawning of that other day, so full of victory to us; and I seem to see them again, as clearly as if it were absolute presence, as I saw them then filing down the road and into the valley " wrapped in their bat- tle-cloaks, woven of fire and smoke--" ah! little can we realize, sitting down tranquilly flushed victors of the fight,-little can we realize eeven now, how the fair valley of the Shenandoah was sanctified that day with heroic, martyr blood. We did not fully comprehend it all even when the day was ended gloriously-we could not take in all the greatness of the struggle, even we, who waited and watched in the reeking wardk, sickening and praying over the dead and dying. And when the night came down and   ATHOL.         393 every hand was busy and every heart full, what did we any of us care then, that Sheridan was still pursuing the enemy, that full subsistence for the army was going for- ward, and our men fresh and eager for another day to dawn andcthe conflict to begin. t We only knew the next nightfall would bring us more wounded and dying, and we heard the word "Victory," as in a dream, vaguely com- prehending that it was only through such a wild baptism of blood we were to reach our peace at last. This was Monday, and up to Friday the battle raged; Early fleeing up the valley, Sheridan hotly pursuing. They made ineffectual stands at Strasberg and another at Flint Hill, both strongly entrenched positions, but from which they were finally driven by our stubborn men now flushed with triumph and easily marking each day as won. On Friday our army rested at Cedar Creek Hill, eleven and a half miles from Strasberg, and every inch of that way bought with a price-how great we began to understand as the days wore on. Friday-yes, it was Friday-when all over the country the glad news was flashing--when Grant's army was thundering out its salute of one hundred guns to Sheridan-when the President had assigned the gallant general the permanent command of the Middle Military Division-when the glad North triumphed with the victors and mourned too over its heroic dead-when every man, woman and child, thought with a thrill of pride, and dimmed, thankful eyes, of the black horse and its fearless rider, and the great work both had done- when the great universal heart of the nation woke and throbbed to the cry of "Victory and Sheridan," then I sat, with no part or lot in the matter, and took a new and greater sorrow than any I had known before into my young life. Friday, September twenty-third-a day of victory and thanksgiving to all save me. Let me tell it to you. 17*     394         ATHOL. It had been- a hard four days to us all. Every moment since the battle began we had been busy. Every day saw the dying borne from our midst, and others falling i to the vacanc places. All a-ound us was one vast hospital. In Winchester alone the rebel wounded amounted to oyer three thousand. That day it seemed as if the ambulances would never cease coming to our gates. Tired, w rn, with a dull throbbing in my temples, and a heart full of I foreboding that I could not clearly define, I went to the open window to get a treath of cool, fresh air, and es- cape for the moment, if possible, from the torment of the place. I stood there look'ng out over the valley and uj to the hills, lying so hushed and beautiful under the clear i blue sky, and wondered how God could be so cruel and the earth so fair; and then I turned my eyes back into the A dim, feverish ward, and watched Angelique as she went $ to and fro among the white beds, doing the noblest  work God ever gave to woman, wondering all the time how, if He were just, he could permit this cruel slaughter to go on. I laid my heacd down upon the window sill to  shut out the sight, and- ried to deaden my ears to all sound as well. It was kill ing me. The very air I breath- ed, cool and fresh from the silent hills, stifled and poison- ed me. It was a pestilentilI charnel-hou-ea life in death  to me. Ah! for the days that were no more! I longed wearily to go away from it all, to take up once more the  old careless girl-life I ha I put away. I dreaded eve y fresh arrival. I dreaded any tidings of the battle. I 1-  most held my breath every time I heard the slow rumble  of approaching wheels, springing up with a vague fore- boding to search the faces of the newly brought in, and yet with a shuddering dread turning away not daring to look. One of the Sisters cam- up to me. She put her hand upon mine, firmly yet kind-they were always kind to m   ATHO)L.         395 "Courage," she' whispered. "'You have need to summon all your strength. It has been a terrible day, and it will be a far worse night I am afraid." "Worse than this?"I questioned tremblingly. "There are no more places to take the wounded," she said. "Every house is used as a hospital in Win- chester, and our wards were full long ago. And still you see they are coming." She pointed to the road wliere the dark, lumbering am- bulances were slowly creeping toward us. ,Oh! what a weak word glory was to some of those men-what a weak, useless word, was even life now! A moment more, then one of the creaking vehicles stopped under the win- dow and I saw huddled on the coarse straw, tossing, pain- racked, moaning'men, or more horrible by far, the blood- stained, almost motionless figures of those who had under- gone amputation before being brought hither. Ambu- lance after ambulance discharged its hideous freight. Even the Sisters, strong and cool-nerved as they were, shuddered at the sights and sounds, as these wrecks of humanity were lifted 'from. their couch or litter and brought in. Some were already dead, the men found as they lifted them roughly, and then with an unconquerable feeling of tenderness even in their roughness, covering' the ghastly face decently and bearing the poor body away. How many dead white faces lay staring up at the blank blue sky that day?-How many noble hearts had been stilled forever?-How many weary feet had trod the path the great elder Brother had trodden before, and gone on into 'the dim Hereafter, to swell the ranks in the " noble army of martyrs?"--The unrecorded dead! Ah! in this war their name was legion. I turned quickly away fromn the window.. I could no longer look, and as I turned, my eyes fell full upon a tall, motionless figure, on a stretcher in the open doorway.     396         A HO,.l The one I had been looki g for so long! The one who was more to me than all t]e world besides! More than a year ago I had kissed :hose white, still lips, and said "good night," never dreaming the-night would be so long--- more than a year since he had said so wildly, so wickedly, that he had defied Heaven once and he dared do it again to make me his wife-mole than a year since those arms had closed around me, and he had pillowed my head upon his breast. And was it thus we met after our long part- ing? Was it thus the morr w for which I had waited anid longed, dawned at last for me? Dead or dying--I knew not which-I only stood there, all my soul concentrated in that one searching gaze, 3taring down at him with clasp- ed hands, trying to still th tumult of my breaking heart. The dying sunlight lit up ;he pale, rigid features, with a mockery of brightness, it flAshed on the tarnished button s of the army coat thrown o er him-on the white, nerve- less hands-the bandages and blood-stained limbs lying so straight and still. "Every place is full," I heard one of the bearers say, looking up in my face with tired dismay. "The doctors have ordered him in here, and he must stay if we leave him in this hall. We have been everywhere and are tired out." Poor, weary souls, and kind even in their weariness, for they had made the litter of pine comfortable as army blankets and coats could make it. I noted it all with a strange, bewildered numbness creeping over me-eveni the few white hairs which a year, only a year, had added But I was quite still and outwardly calm, as much so as Angelique, and I walked collectedly forward. "We must find some place for him," I said going up to her, grasping her arm and pointing to the motionless figure. "You will find some place for him? He is my charge-mine alone-do not fail me now." ,#   ATHOL.          397 For a moment our eyes met. Mine so fierce with the hungry want of my life glaring in their depths; hers so earnest, calm, penetrating, comprehending me instantly, as they always did. She went up to the bearers with her quick, noiseless step, and the composed grave look her face always wore. A few words and they turned, follow- ing her, bearing their burden slowly and carefully. This hospital had been a church once, and the house adjoining had been occupied by the priests. When the contending armies swept over the hills and into the val- leys, devastating as they went, this building, saved from the general ruin, was set apart for sanitary purposes. The lecture-room beneath had been cleared of its pews and kneeling benches, as had also the body of the church itself, and filled with beds for the sick, even the robing- room back of the chancel we had given to our wounded Ohio boy. This was the only spot left now-here there was room for two or three cots more-she would place him in there. I watched her as she walked quickly on before, following them and not daring to take my eyes from the white face. She opened the door, she drew aside a folding screen. "Now place him here," she di- rected. "So,"'and the pale, blood-stained figure was side byhide with our dying friend. His great pathetic eyes, languid and luminous, met mine, resting on me silently, watching in turn the Sister's preparations. I saw a shadow pass over his face as he looked, and the girlish blue eyes were full of tears. He put up his wasted hand to shut out the sight. "If it is amputation," he shuddered," take him from here. I cannot bear it-indeed I cannot." Angelique bent over him smoothing back his tangled hair. "It has been done, n;y son. It is all over now and we have only to nurse him and bring him around as we shall     A 398          THOL. you yet. But to-morrow you shall be moved. We will find a nice quiet place away from all these sights and sounds, where you can be alone and rest." "And where I may lie," he said softly, turning his face to the wall and not looking at us any more. The Sister drew the screen before his couch; she placed a cooling draught by his bedside, bent over him whispering a few gentle words, drew the curtain aside tfor air, and then turned to Jo-n. The doctor had been suiln- moned, and when he lifted the army coat and moved iim gently, I saw with a sickening dread what cruel work had been done. The right leg was amputated above the knee. I turned away my head--I could not look as they unwouTnd the bandages, soaked and stiff with blood.  For a long time the surgeon and Angelique bent over him, doing their ghastly work, while I crouched silently in a darkened corner of the room, dreading every sound and not daring to raise my he d. But no moan of suffering escaped him, and in the twful stillness it seemed to mr I could hear nothing but the beating of my own heart., When the doctor was gone and I dared trust myself Ito come to the bedside and look into his face, the eyes were still closed, the lips pressed firmly together. He had dot spoken or noticed anything since he was brought in, Hour after hour went by and still I sat there, rigid and silent, doing all that the Sister bade me, but doing it mechanically and feeling s if living in a horrible dreamn,  from which I must shortly waken. He lay thus quietly until far in the night, with his eyes closed, lying so s-ill and nerveless we almost t lought him dead; but presently he began moving uneasi y on his pillow, muttering and moaning feebly in his death-like sleep. And still I sat there watching with an uncontrollable dread of his awak- ening, trying tokstill the keen pain at my heart, noting l" the changes thatwere slowly creeping over his face, until   ATHOL.         399 the surgeon came up on his round again. I saw the Sis- ter go and meet him, and I hung intently on every word they uttered as they drew near the bedside, he looking down upon John with his quick, keen glance, and then at us inquiringly. "How long has he been this way?" he asked. "For the last two or three hours," I said-" nearly all night." "Bad. Every way bad," shaking his head. "Does he keep moaning this way all the time? ,' I nodded assent. He took up John's hand, holding it in his own, press- ing his fingers long upon the bounding pulse, then laid it down again, gently and without a word. I summoned all my strength and my whole soul went out in the question- "Will he live, doctor?" smothering a sob fiercely under my breath. He looked in my face for a moment without speaking, then turned to Angelique. "We cannot tell-while there is life there is hope." Very slowly and distinctly he spoke,-yet I heard the sound, muffled far away, and deadened as it were, and I could not see him for the sudden mist and darkness which fell before me. Shudderingly I crept closer to his dear side. I put out my hand and took his. It was hot and burning. He opened his eyes and looked full upon me, as I crouched silently there, but there was an unsteady, wild glare in their dark depths which I had never see.] there before. They roved -from one to the other with no ray of recognition in them. Quietly nurse and surgeon did their work and passed on. It was getting to be an old story with them all. God help me! I had not seen enough to make me bear this calmly. I would not leave him--I would give up all else but to be by him-brief comfort! for I felt God would not spare him very long to     400         AT'HOL.  me. And then, watching and waiting, I saw the busy lit- tle surgeon passing through the same survey in the crowded ward beyond--saw the black, composed figures of the Sisters passing ifn- and out among the white cots-- saw Angelique stooping over the suffering with her cool, soothing touch, her ready sympathy, her willing hand. But I?-what was the whole world to me now? what now that long line of pain-rac:ked men-what their agonies and death shrieks? my world lay here--my all in all-my life. He was all mine now. I wound my arms around hilm. I laid the burning head' lpon my breast. He should not die, I said over and o er again, and wildly) wickedly, I thought that even Christ's arms could not hold him so J -tenderly as did mine. ] would not give him if--not even to God! And all through that night I watched him with that  sickening, hopeless defiance at my heart, trying to still his insane ravings, and hu h him to repose. Sometimes he would try to rise, and it was with the greatest difficulty I could keep him in the position in which the doctor had placed him. Sometimes he would wave his arm over his head, shouting out old attle songs and gay refrains, lwith a wild mirth that froze rme with terror as I listened. And then he would fall into a sudden, troubled sleep, mutterinng incoherent words and noaning piteously as if in pain, or he would urge on his men, shouting out his orders in a wild, hoarse voice: "Forward!" he would cry, " forward! only one more charge! up and at them, my boys--my brave boys! Ha, ha! cnly once to die. Who said that only once to die? Guy, old fellow, there is no judgment after that once to die!"And then he muttered to him- self inarticulately of thel judgment which was to follow. And then again the heavy lids would droop and he would sleep, though only for a moment, when the restless rav- ings would begin again, and he would moan and rock imn- self to and fro and call for Grace, stretching up agonizing , I , ,  -  ;  - a        . -   ATHOL.          40I hands to Heaven, and once-ah! my God! he called for Daisy, and said ' she would not come," and all the time Daisy was near him-over him, clasping his hot, throbbing hands, calling him old fond names, but feeling, through it all, he would never know his little Daisy again. I laid a cool napkin upon his burning brow, I put water to the parched lips, and he held my cold hands in his, grasping them with feverish energy, and talking to me at intervals with an incoherent raving which I had not power to still. And so the dreary dawning widened into day, with sudden bursts of wind and rain and thun- der mutterings. - How dreary a day to us who watched! I had not closed my heavy eyes for even an instant's rest. I had noted every change that came and went over the face. I felt no fatigue though every weary nerve was braced to the task. DOne only dominant feeling rose up within me: his life must be saved! All that day I watch- ed him with the same hopeless defiance at my heart, try- ing in vain to still his wanderings, until the twilight's dull shadows crept in through the old pointed windows, and Angelique came in to relieve me. I would not leave him at first, but she quietly compelled obedience, bidding me husband my strength and brace myself to a long and weary task. Even then I did not tell her who the Colonel was, or why I had claimed him so completely as my own. And she never asked me; only, as she pressed me to her heart-for a moment I heard a low prayer, and, heretic though I was, I somehow felt happier for the whispered blessing. It stilled the defiant remonstrance of my heart and made me long for some refuge to flee to-some "rock that was higher than I," as strong and sure as the one to which the Sister clung.     402         ATHOL. CHAPTER XXXI. DAY after day went by. I counted time by despairing heart beats. Day after cay I watched the fever deepen and the shadows darker around the sick bed, with a fierce, keen pain at my h art which I could not still into submission. There was no fear of recognition now. When the eyes met mine scarcely knew them as John's, there was such an insane gleam in their dark depths. I did not dare again ask th doctor how long it would last; I did not even tell Angelique all the fears and hopes that trembled in my -heart. I kept them there stilling every other feeling in passionate waiting and inarticulate pray- er. All the bitter, rebellio s reasoning was gone. I could quietly wait now. My wicked defiance had exhausted t- self. We had removed' our sick and dying Ohio boy to a farm-house near by, wh re those convalescing were placed, and upon whom so me of the Sisters were in alter- nate attendance; so the little robing-room was John s alone. Every night when tt e surgeon went his last round, I longed to ask him if there was any hope, but I could not. And all through the long dark nights I watched anxiously for the morrow, and when the wished-for dawn- ing came, crept wearily away to snatch a few hours' rest, and to pray God for another to-morrow. How the time dragged! How like years the days seemed, and how I dreaded those dark, cruel nights, when the house was still and the lights dim. It was so much   ATHOL.         403 worse than the daytime. Light gives one courage, but we are all timorous children and cowards in the darkness. With the coming of,dawn too came another strength and support; the-early visit of the surgeon. How I. watched his face! How I longed to ask him if John'would live or die, but I dared not trust myself. To die? oh! no, I could not think of that. Many a night-watch did Ange- lique share with me, for it often required two to control his insane ravings, but gradually the fever seelned abating, and he would lie sometimes for hours, apparently ex- hausted without any of the delirium which so terrified me. One night I was obliged to watch with him alone. Some of the Sisters had been sent away and Angelique was every instant busy. "I could call," she said, "if I need- ed her," and she left me, opening the chancel-door so that I might see her and not feel so entirely alone. The most profound silence rested over the whole house and in the wards. I shaded the lamp with a screen and placed it where the light might not awaken the sleeper, and then sat down by the bedside to watch. He seemed to be sleeping, but so quietly that but for the low irregular breathing I could have fancied him dead. A great awe and hush fell upon me as I looked at the face, so still, so awful in its whiteness. It was a warm night for October. The window was up, but no breeze came down to us from the hills. A dead, silent night,-a horrible night to me. There was such a weight of woe at my heart, and I had carried it there so long I felt it was killing me. I drew my breath unevenly and longed for air, and rest and hope-if I might but hope. I loosened my dress at the throat and drew back the white muffling. I leaned out into the darkness and thought wearily it was like my life- no ray of light anywhere, and the hills standing up before me against the dusky sky, frowning, black and tall, seemed shutting me out from the world beyond like the shadow l     404          ATHOL. of an avenging fate. I turned away from the window and came back to John, and the night wore slowly on; still he slept and I waited. I sat close by his bedside lean- ing over him, listening for every faint breath until it seemed to me I lost it altogether. I put my ear down-no life or sound apparently. I reached out my hand sudden- ly and touched the broad, high forehead of the sleeper, and started as I felt how cold and damp it had grown. The wildest fears flashed through. my mind-my terrors rolled over me like a flood-I could bear it no longer. I  lifted the little lamp from the table and shading it with my  hand, bent over and looked into his face. He lay upo  one side, the hair falling over the pillow like a pall; dark shadows lay underneath the closed eyes: the old firmness  about the mouth was gone-a womanish, pathetic softness lay around it-a shadow almost of another world hovered there. I looked up at the clock. It was near midnight, and my heart sank within me as I remembered how man souls had gone out to God in that dark hour of nigh. What if even now the daw} of another life was slowly breaking with the day-what life-what hope for him ir the great unknown Hereafter? I ran swiftly across to the Sister bending over the cot of some sufferer. "The doc- tor," I said, "quick! lose no time," and I was back at his side in an instant. It seemed hours instead of minutes, that I hung over him in agonized waiting, before the sur! geon came. His practical ieyes took in the situation at once. He shook his head gravely. "Stimulants--stim- ulants--that is all we can do--you should have called me before." And he poured brandy between the closed lips, while Angelique and I chafed the lifeless hands. "How long has he lain in this stupor?" he asked. And I whispered, "two or three hours. I thought the sleep was for his good."   ATHOL.         405 'It is the crisis. There is only just one chance for him, and if he misses it-all I can do I have done. Feed the brandy regularly, and if he goes, it will be in a sleep like this. If he wakes, call me," and the kind-hearted doctor bent down once again to listen to the faint flutter- ings of life. "It is just a chance in ten, but he may pull through yet-while there is life there is hope. Barnes and Trim Scott are going to-night, and I must be there-poor fellows!" I looked up in his face wistfully. "Come back soon, doctor. Do not leave us long." He laid his fingers on the feeble pulse again, and looked long and closely at John. "I tell you I have hope, but it may be against hope. If he pulls through to-night, he'll do." And he left us, tired and worn, to stand by the bedside of the two who were "going" that night. How could he speak so coolly? Going? Ah! dear God, whither? And I, shuddering, turned to John, never moving my gaze from that deathful face. For an hour or more he lay motionless as before, apparently sleeping; sometimes I almost fancied the breath gone, but when the morning's dim dawn crept into the room and over the cot, touching with its pale, cold light the wan face, the dark eyes opened full and wide with the old familiar light in their depths-no cloud or fever pain in them any longer. I bent down over the thin hand so he could not see me. "Water," he whispered faintly, and Angelique put it to his lips, for I did not dare. Then she leaned over him, softly arranging the pillows, and I sank behind her in the shadow of the bed. He could not turn his feeble eyes and see me, but I could look down upon him and note every change. It was only anr instant--a glance around-then the white lips dropped and he slept again. Angelique fell on her knees by his bed; her upturned face glowed with     406         AT OL. thankfulness and peace; sloly the beads dropped through  her fingers one by one, and er rlips moved in prayer. I, tried to follow her, but the tumultuous cry of my heart was only "Thank God! 'Thnk God!-" When I loolked down at John again, his eyes were open and fixed on Angelique. She did not heed him, but I saw him watch with a yearning wonder the gentle face grow beautiful and luminous with strange ecstasy-sublime in its exalted communings. Then he whispered feebly, " one prayer for me," and laying her crucifix on his lips, she bent over him, tenderly murmuring words of strong en- treaty to the "Holy Mary, Mother of God." He lay tranquilly for sorme time with dim eyes fixed 3 upon her face. A long pause, when the gentle pleading ended, and she breathed softly, "O Mary, Mother of  Mercy, obtain from thy Divine Son the grant of these my I : petitions." A long pause, during which he lay folding his wasted fingers one over the other. A sigh broke from him, a murmur-the Sister bent her head. "You are so good, so kind; but I want something else. Will no one say for me one little prayer that sounds like home?" -- He was so weak he would never know my voice, chok- ing and full of sobs as it was, and I kneeled down, mur- muring out solemnly as I could the "Our Father," in  which Angelique and even Jo nn joined, and then gather- ing strength with the attempt, I repeated all of that beau- tiful, touching prayer for the sick, which I had learned but too well in this sorrowful place. I felt him shudder sensi- bly when I came to the solemn " or else;" but he lay very quietly when I had finished, a look almost of peace steal- ing over his features, and exhausted, murmuring thanks, he closed the tired eyes again and Angelique and I silent- ly took up our watching-watching until the busy surgeon came in on his morning round and, looking into the   ATHOL.         407 white, calm face, told us he would live. Then I crept away, leaving him to the Sister with the words sounding in my ears and filling my heart until the measure of my joy seemed almost pain. How could I leave him now! How live apart from him any longer, after going with him so near to the dark valley! How teach my feet to go back again into the old paths this Sister had laid before me! Hlow turn away and never let him know I had been so near him! And with weary limbs and throbbing brain I lay on my unquiet couch, torturing myself anew with these thoughts, until the sun stood high in the heavens,'and I fell asleep from very weariness of the contending joy and grief of my heart. And again when night came down I took my place by his side, and learned from Angel- ique it was no trick of my disordered brain; that the doc- tor said he would live with care and nursing; that he was nearly out of danger now-it was almost too much joy to bear! I had wakened with such a sickening heart, fear- ing some unlooked-for change might have come while I was sleeping. I sat beside the screen in completest shadow, letting the soft light from the shaded lamp fall so that I could see the white face I loved so well. Long and closely I studied it as I bent over him. I could only sit here by him a very little longer--he might waken at any moment and know me--only at night and in this garb could I watch by his side, only a very, very little longer. He was sleeping quietly and gently as a child. His hands were lying feebly and nerveless on the coverlets. How wasted they were and how loosely the heavy ring hung on his finger. How well I knew that ring!"Teneo " on its seal. The blinding tears would come. I had kept them back so long, I could not any longer, and they dropped heavily upon his hand. He stirred, murmured something softly to himself, and I drew back hastily into the shadow again. Again he spoke. I leaned over him so he could     408         XATHOL. not see my face, and bent down to hear what he inight sa He raised his hand and touched the beads which hung from my waist, then droppec them feebly at his side againL Again he spoke, so lbw I had to bend over him to hear. l "Are you the one who said that little prayer for me last night? won't you repeat it once more for me? It seemed almost like home." I did not dare refuse, I teared this time he might rec. ognize the voice-yet I kn lt by the bedside without ar answer. I hid my face in jy hands, but my voice shook so I could hardly control it, when I asked again for strength to live, or strength to die, as God the giver pleased. All at once I felt his hand upon my arm-the trembling fingers clutched my wrist-they fastened them- selves upon the little bracel t which had slipped from be-i neath my sleeve-his gift-' Teneo" on its clasp. I had  never taken them off since that night he had fastened  them there. I could hear Iis breath come quickly in gasps as he tried to speal-then, weak as he was, he reached both arms toward me-he raised my bowed head and tore the wrappings from my face! My first impulse was to fly, but a dead, cold fright took possession of me, and heart and strength suddenly failed me. For a mo- ment one moment-face to face-the wild glare of rec- ognition lighting up his, so white and haggard, set in its dead black frame of tossed a d tangled hair-for one mo- l ment a silence-then he dro ped both arms feebly by his side. "My darling!" he whisp red. "My little, lost Daisy, come here to me." I knew concealment woulc no longer avail. I thought even the sudden shock might kill him, weak as he was, but I could no longer keep from him. I sprang up and laid my face, hot, panting, bat ed in sudden tears against his own. His arms opened t take me in-to drasw me '* 1    ATHOL.         409 feebly closer to him--again and again with only a sobbing, inarticulate cry. of " at last-my child, my child." Oh! the joy, the wild, bewildering joy, of that moment! I could not speak. I dared not move, I scarcely dared breathe-my head upon his breast, his arms about me close--so close. I could not find a word to say. I could only sob out upon his heart all my passion of joy. This was all I had prayed and longed for. Only to see him once more. Only to hear his voice and know he loved me still. Only to be clasped once more in his dear arms, to feel his kisses on my face. Only this-and then?- then I thought I could leave him-but now- How long a time it seemed before he spoke. "What a dreary world it has been to me since you left me, Daisy! We must never part again-my love, my child, look up- tell me, you will never leave me again?" But I never stirred or spoke. How could I? Heaven and God, though still far from me, had been nearer to me lately than of old-and a life ever with him-how short, how perishable-and the path to the Infinite lost, perhaps forever, in the blackness of this sin. My lips moved, but I could utter no articulate sound. I tried to raise myself from his arms but I could not. "You need not fear to lie upon my heart," he mur- mured softly and tenderly, with his feeble hands on my head in the old, fond way!" my wife is dead, and you ate all mine now-nothing but God shall separate us in this life-or in the life to come!" The reaction was too much, I could not bear the sudden joy. I raised my head from his embrace. I ut- tered one cry, a long, low cry, from a thankful, bursting heart-saw John's face, but far away and indistinctly as in a dream-saw the flaming lights go round -and rou id, and with a sense of never-ending falling stretched out my hands blindly to him, and knew nothing more. 18     4Io         ATHOI,. CHAPTER XXXII. WHEN I regained strength and memory Angelique was bending over me, tenderly bathing my face. I tried to struggle to my feet but she put her hand upon me and held me down. "You must be quiet. Everything depends on you now. The doctor will not answer for the consequence if the . Colonel is not allowed the utmost quiet and rest. How could you be so rash!--his fever will return, I dare say."  "Let me go to him," I said wildly, springing to my feet. "He will die--he will die,. and I shall be the ! cause!!" "If you really mean to kill him outright you might as well go at once," shebsaid, with the first symptom of im- patience I had ever seen her manifest. I fell back on my couch, silenced for the moment, closing my eyes and going over and, over again the rap- ture of my meeting with John., Angelique sat all the time like a black shadow by my side, without saying a word. "Who is with him?" at'last I ventured to question. "The doctor, and he will not leave him until he is more composed, and he will not let us in, so you are forced to be content." I reached out my hand. and took her slender white fingers in mine. "Content?"I whispered softly. "So content--you do not know--you can never know! Put your face down close to mine, dear Sister, and I will tell you something while we are waiting." ,;Ei   ATHOL.         4l And she leaned down over me, listening while I began and told her all my life. How I first began to love John-- when a mere child, from the very first moment he met me on the bleak, rough hills, and claimed me as his own. I had told her my life before, but not all the wild, ab- sorbing weakness of my love. And I told her besides, that in watching by his sick bed I had felt if he were to die, nothing it this life could ever give me one ray of happiness again. That even now I loved him with an idolatry that was too sinful to dare ask Heaven for a bless- ing upon it. I went hurriedly through without any inter- ruption, and then looked up in her face for answer. "He will live," she said when I had ended. "I knew who it was from the first. I saw how it would end. My gift of God was only like all his other gifts--lent. Then regretfully I thought, 'yes, he will live.' " "God will let him live," I said quickly, "He will give him to me-and yet, since I have lain here thinking, the fear would thrust itself in my heart that if he lives my cup of joy would be too full. Such happiness, so perfect as that of which I dream, seldom dwells long on earth. And yet I cannot put it from me again, let it be ever so brief." She looked down at me pleadingly, solemnly. "And I shall lose you, and the Church will lose you. Oh! my child, think it over well. Earthly love is perish- able. Choose now. Choose not for the fleeting pleasures of this life, but for the unfading glories of the promised mansion above. The Church opens wide her arms to enfold you-my child-we cannot give you up!" I knew her heart-how well had I learned it!-I knew her love, her zeal, her faith, but I turned from it all shud- deringly. "I could not bear to wound or grieve you, dearesi Sis- ter," I said. '"Your love and care and holy lessons will never be forgotten; but even if John were dead," and I     "2   .AT OL.                   f shuddered at the possibility, l' your faith and church could never be mine. I have tried, but in vain-heretic I have  always been and must so remain. i You will love me nonet the less that a gulf so wide separates us?" She pressed her hand to her heart as if in sudden pain. She bent over me touching my forehead with her lips, and signing me with the sea; of our mutual redemption-2- the sign which all humanity may claim alike--murmuring all the time broken words of entreaty and sorrow. But I could not listen to them. The new life which had beguna - for John had also dawned -fr me. In the golden flood light of that day's breaking I had entwrapped myself. Life, and love, and rest, had come down upon my heart-here 1I would they abide. God was good. And the happy tears   dimmed my eyes as I lay back quietly going over it agairn in thought, and listening through it all for the doctor's  coming. Presently the doog was-pushed open softly ancd  he looked in. "You may go, now," nodding to me. c B1u be very cautious and pru ent-exverything depends oi proper care now." I waited to hear no mor , but hurriedly and gratefully went back to the sick room, and noiselessly sat down, fear - ing lest the least motion should wake him. A long time I sat thus, he slept such an exhausted, peaceful sleep. Tlm wards were profoundly qui t; the clock in the alcove w .s ticking faintly'; the air ca ne in through the half-opened window, cool, fresh and fragrant. I sat so long in this unbroken quiet, that insensibly to myself, I began to fill  into that pleasant languor preceding sleep, when a faint movement from John roused me. I was by him in an instant.      - l "It is no dream after all, cherie, to wake and find you here. Come to me," putting out his hand. "Come here and let me look at you, and know for a surety it is no dream."   ATHOL.         413 I knelt down by the bed and put my cheek close to his. Long and earnestly did the dark eyes rest upon my face-then roved over my dress, staring fixedly at the rosary hanging at my side-then back to my face again, seeming to absorb my life and being in the steady, loving gaze.  "Ah! my little Daisy," he said, "my little, lost Daisy, look at me: see all that I have become-maimed, useless for life, heart-sick and weary, longing to live nearer God and Heaven than I have ever lived before-longing for a guide, though it be only a child like yourself, who shall lead me. You have gone with me so near to the eternal gates-will you stay with me now and be my strength, my teacher in all good things, until God separates us here?" "I will never leave you, John," I said softly, and lay- ing my head down upon his heart. "We will put all the sorrowful past away from us," he went on in a choking voice. "We will build up for our- selves a future, fairer and more enduring than that we dreamed of in the bygone time. You have given me back this life I thought so worthless, and I cannot spend it apart from you; but we will begin the new life together-we will live not for the present alone, but for that great and never- ending time where all this love will be perfected-you will help me learn, my love--you will be as now, my strength, my comforter?" "Always, John." "I shall be a pbor, mutilated drag all the rest of my days. I may never walk again, even if Iget well-you will never regret it-you will not weary of me, my dar- ling?" The tears blinded me for a moment so I could hardly see the look of pain his face wore.   - "Oh! John," I said. "Do you not know even now- can you not guess, how little all-the world is to me, if I     4I4         ATHOL.  have not you? I care not low disfigured, how mutilated: to me you are all in all-my hope, my strength-if you cast me from you it is death, and if you take me to your heart it is life. Oh! no, John, nothing must part us now!  "( And yet you left me, Mzerie." "But I loved you thro-gh it all. Perhaps more madly the night I left it all behind me than ever before. God knows I loved you John, but I loved your good name and honor more than all bside.^          II "Put your arms about me-so-I shall lean on you  henceforth. God be thanlsed, my little love, for this hap-  piness at last," and I softly said "Amen," as I pillowed the dear head upon my breast.                 And then, thankful and\exhausted, he slept again slept in my arms, and I kLLeA sull rest meant life and strength to him. And looking down upon the peaceful face, with the tremulous smile of content hovering about the pale lips, and loving it more than all else in the world beside, I resolved I. would be, if. God spared my life, a comfort and support to himn all his days. It seemed so strange, so unreal to be happy again! So strange to lie there with his head upon my arm, slowly wrapping myself in a dream of bliss, deeper and more enduring than any I had ever imagined before. For more than a year we had been separated. A cruel, wild, stormy time; through battle, strife ancloodshed, under blazing southern suns, in the winter's bitter cold, through seas of blood and wild heart-agony, and now I had but to put out my hand and clasp him close-so near me now-  so wholly mine. I sat looking down at him through fast- falling tears of joy, steeping my soul in happiness beyond expression; conscious bu: of two things in the whole, wide world: his presence and his love. Thus, as the days went-by, I wooed him back to life and me. I saw with rapture the slow return to. health, the   ATHOL.         415 deadly pallor fading, the worn look of suffering going slowly out of the dark eyes. One day when the doctor gave him crutches and declared he was able to essay walking again, he called me to him and begged to lean on me; and it was I who placed the crutch under his arm arid walked by his side, letting him lean on me as he wished, only asking that I might thus. wait upon him and care for him all my life. It was only a few steps, from his couch to the easy chair, and then I sat down on a low seat by his side, and listened while he asked me, with something of the old imperious ring in his feeble voice, "If I would be his wife in a month, in a week, or a day! seeing he was never to be anything but a cripple now all the rest of his life." And I said with the same blind obe- dience dictating the answer which I had given him once before, "in a day if he liked--" and sitting there in the little room back of the chancel, once so sacred with the presence of priests and echoes of prayer, with the red light of a dying day flashing through the old pointed windows, and making the pale face glorious in its thoughtful beauty, he drew me to his side and told me all the heavy burden of his soul which he had carried about with him so many years. I shall not record all his explanations. It is enough for me to say when John was a mere youth just ending his university career, immersed in a round of pleasure and dissipation, with a keen love of the beautiful and pos- sessing all the susceptibility of an ardent. impetuous temperament, he met Adele Geffroi, a new star just com- ing out in Paris, and dancing nightly to crowds of admir- ing people at the Theatre Royal. He was young, with money enough to make him an object of attraction to the wily debutante. . She was beautiful as a dream-well-it was the old story over again-and he loved her too well to refuse making her his wife. Then his father in anger X     4I         ATHOL. and wounded pride, cast Lim off, and for years he expatri- ated himself from home and friends, giving up all in the world for love of one fair false face. But too soon the scales fell from his eyes, and he found out the guilty, heart- less life of intrigue she was leading; and then he told me what a sad, sad life of dreary expiation and restless wan- dering he -lived for many a year afterward, finally putting it all desperately away from him, and coming back to his old home after his father died, taking upon- himself ithe new duties and itesponsibIlities which had been so solenn- ly bequeathed to him by that dying father. Again and again had he sent Adele money through his banker; again and again did he respond to her extortionate de- mands, only feeling the price too small if it but purchased silence of the past. Then he heard of her death, and feel- ing his release s ddenly and thankfully, he had after a time entered society again, and rid of the old thraldom had almost succumbed to the charms of my tormentor, Miss Marshton.  Yet, he confessed feeling, through it all, a strange love which he could not put aside toward the child confided so entirely to his care. Long did he strug- gle with the emotion, feeling it to be almost a sin to join  a young, pure life, to one so burdened with remorseful memories. Long did he strive, until his heart was no longer his own to control; but even in his greatest joy, al- ways feeling that pang of guilty shame, at hiding from the innocent eyes the life which he vainly tried to forget as an ugly, torturing dream. And then together we strayed back into the pleasant path of our love just beginning, and pursued it with many a pause and explanation and self-reproach up to the time of our miserable parting, going over- that year of sorrow- ful memories which followed it. And then I learned that Adele died soon after her'meeting with John. Sorrow-ul and. repentant, and even cared for by himih, her last hours " ,     .   ATHOL.         417 nade easy through his generosity; but he never saw her ifter that night. When he had given up the search for ne, he had desperately raised a regiment and joined the Trmy, never thinking to see me in this life again and only 'aring to throw his recklessly away. And then I in turn recounted all my own bitter agony, mnd wandering, and final rest, until we were both lost in . hankfulness that out of that night of thick darkness and imost death, we had been permitted to walk into the :lear breaking of a new day and life. That very evening I wrote to Guy and Harrie. Dear ,ouls! We had quite forgotten, in our own joy, that anx- bus hearts were waiting and longing at home. John had lever heard one word from any of them since his illness, nd neither of us had thought of writing. It seemed very ;trange, when we spoke of it, that no inquiries had been nstituted for him in this department; but then everything vas in a most unsettled state, and Sheridan's army still on ts march, which might account for the long silence. I wrote to Harrie everything, of John's dangerous illness, )f my care of him, and of our intention to be married and :ome home as soon as possible after her own exalted ' Barkis " fashion. I know I was incoherent. I gener- illy am, after the most approved feminine method, but I was too happy to care. ' A few days after this, when I had wheeled John up to  i the open window, and told him in a flutter of joy how much stronger each succeeding day found him, the door opened upon us very quietly and Guy and Dr. Truman to our utter astonishment walked in. What a meeting it was for us all! How many hand-shakings poor John had to endure, and how many involuntary tears the good doctor surreptitiously smuggled away! It would have been laughable, only we all felt too much like joining him. And then followed questions and explanations without number, I8* ,     "8         ATHOL. ' : and reproaches and thar ksgivings, for we all had much to tell as well as hear. Harrie was married, and had been living at the Poplars for six months or more. The old house at Brookdell was closed after John went away, with only Owen and his wi'fe left to care for it; but Alice and Harrie had gone up to open the unused rooms and pre- pare the place for occupancy again. It only remained for us now to get home as soon as John was we ll enough to be moved. They had known nothing of his wounds or illness, but had heard of his capture as a prisoner through the papers, which were not the most reliable sources of in- formation about that time. Harrie sent me a characteristic note by the doctor I cannot begin to remember it now. I only know I laughed first and then cried over it when I was alone; though wh y I should cry I could never distinctly explain even to my- self, for it was anything but an affecting letter; but I knew, dear soul, her heart was a11 the time as full as mine. ] Oh! a happy rest would home be to me again. j        CHAPTER    XXXIII. \ WELL, we were married very quietly, right there in the hospital. Guy married us, and Dr. Truman and the ward surgeon, who had taken such good care of John, were the only witnesses. It did not matter. We were to go hcme by easy stages, and often resting upon the way, directly the ceremony was over. John never looked so noble, so grand, to me before, weak and maimed as he was. He could only stand with the greatest difficulty, leaning on his crutch, looking very pale, but stalwart and strong even in his weakness-more grand than ever, I thought, with   ATHOL.         419 a thrill of pride when I remembered where, and in what cause he had been so cruelly mutilated. For I knew-my darling, my noble, brave and true husband--I knew he had come back to me out of that wild fight for life a better, braver man than he had ever been before in the old boast- ful days of glorying in his own strength and relying upon the might of his own unconquered will. Angelique would not come in and see us married, but when I was going away she came to my rooim where I stood alone by the window, giving. a mute farewell to the old life with all its undying memories, and looking out for the last time over the valley and up to the distant hills, where peace seemed to me to be already brooding and settling. "I was waiting for you," I said, putting out my arms. "I knew you could never part from me in silence." She did not answer; she only folded me to her heart, and then taking my two hands in hers, looked long and steadfastly for the last time upon my face. Hers was lighted up with an almost unearthly light, but the great earnest eyes were heavy and full of unshed tears. "I cannot give you up!" she/ said.. . "I cannot part from you now. Oh! my child, promise me you will re- member some of my teachings; promise me you will love the dear Mother Church-just a little, and for my sake- say the prayers, and-will you keep this?" And she put into my hands her own rosary-he'ldl me to her heart a momejnt-pressed her lips upon my cheek, and turned away without eveAi a ' good-bye." I have the rosary yet. I shall always keep it; and the memory of the pure saint, to whom those prayers were strength and comfort, lingers in my heart ever, like the re- membrance of her gentle life. I am not ashamed of my little Romish relic of the past. God be thanked!--I love my own faith none the less for its possession. For I have     420          ATHOL. a faith and a hope and a sure trust now-the faith which Guy has since taught me--the faith in which sister lived and died and which Jhn, too, has reverently acce )ted- the faith which, broad7 Catholic and wide, tells me that as children of one common Father, we, though not all tread- ing the same path, have yet the same God and H eaven and eternal rest in view--that meeting there at the last, where all these differe nces are laid aside, we shall only dwell in Him and He in us. Ah! how I love it n ow, as Geoffrey told me once I would. How like the shadow of a great rock it has risen up to me in a weary land. I Yes, God be thanked! a shadow and a rest.    i    ! We have settled down very quietly, very soberly, into .  what outsiders might term a very tame existence, but which we will tell you we would not exchange with any other couple in the wolId. Twice a week the falnilies from i the Rectory and the?plars dine with us. Dear old Guy and Alice are going th same steady round of dutie s yet, and little Grace Flemin g, the pet of the family, is in a fair way of being spoiled by us all. As for the doctor and Hal, a happier Darby end Joan would be hard to find. He still flies his democriatic banner, and it is such an - un- speakable comfort to hm, we rather enjoy it than other- wise. , In fact the wortlIy doctor has almost made us like democracy, though we won't acknowledge it to himJ just S for the sake of a little c vil war in our midst, for a variety and in memory of "lanr syne." Hal is simply the sName old irrepressible she used to be. I cannot say in t ruth she has grown one whit older or steadier than when I ifirst knew her. Under her careless direction the hous/e is much less formal and old-fashioned, and I am happy to record that the big brass knocker is off the front door! The Marshtons have come back to the Lea, but 0nly Bella and Lizzie are left. Georgie married abroad, and is living in Paris, that Paradise for dissatisfied Anmeri- I         I -    ATHOL.          42T cans-perfectly happy, Lizzie says, though her husband is a very Guy to look at and old into the bargain. Lizzie and I are still great friends. Many and many a time do we go together to Geoffrey's grave, around which the grass grows green, and violets and roses cluster and bloom, and wild winds whisper softly, all through the long pleas- ant summers which have come and gone since he was laid to rest. "A tender memory " has he indeed become to us all, as he wished. Mr. Thorn distinguished himself in the war, was brevetted and-remains in the army still. We heard from him a little time ago in Arizona. The rebellion made a nian of him, as it did of many another slothful, careless, idler in the world. Also, I do not think he ever quite recover- ed from the shock of Geoffrey's death. Brookdell is look- ing beautiful. The old house has been thoroughly re- paired, only, we have left sister's room just as it was, but it is not closed as heretofore. It is thrown open as it used to stand in her lifetime, and the pleasant cabinet room is still our gathering place as of old. We have a kind of fancy that Grace is not very far away at such times, and we cannot feel the break jn the home circle when we have her so continually in our hearts. On these pleasant autumn evenings, when John and I are. alone, the curtains .closely drawn, the fire blazing ruddily in the grate, and the round table before it with a shaded lamp burning softly, and'old Nep and Ponto at our feet on the hearth rug, we often lay down our books and go over the story of our lives, feeling it, even now at this lapse of time, almost an unreal thing to be so happy. Sometimes-as to-night--I carry in my portfolio, and while John is reading his paper, of which he is fond as ever, I scribble upon these loose leaves, which after a time I shall gather together and give to you. And then I look across at John, sitting in his easy chair, his crutch by     422         ATHOL. his side-for I would never consent to one of Palmer's abominations; I want every one to know, as I do, that my husband fought at Winchester-his head upon This hand-and I look at him so long, noting even now, how the shadows of that desperate fight for life still cling to him, and always will I fear-that before I know it, my eyes are misty with falling tears, and I dash them away feeling John's glance on me, and I know he is reading all the thoughts in my face as he has learned so well to do; so I bend very hastily over my paper, writing hurriedly again,  and not caring to let him know how, always, in my very happiest moments, a thought of losing him will intrude And when I dare look up again I see, still smil ng down at me, with the same fond, loving smile, it has wdrn so many years, such a dear, dear face. And le leans down, putting back my hair, saying just as he used to long ago: "Little one, of what are you writing? Are you coming out like a second Miss Nightingale with directions f or hospital nursing? Or is it, in consideration of your great amid valuable experience as housekeeper, all opposition to the Beecher Cookery Bo ok?" And I shut up my book and shake my head, and tell him "some time in the ftlture he shall know." Some time in the future he will .ee and read all this, and then he will know, if he does not now, how I have loved him so many, many years. Oh  brave and generous heart It is all Inine now, and I say t{ myself with thankful content it were worth the pain and suffering in times that are past' to reach such rest as this h me of mine at last. For ] am  happy!-so happy tha  I felt I must tell it to the world. You wouldn't laugh ;tt all the foolishness of a wife, who calls this joy ever new, though she has borne it more than four happy years, would you? Do not call me ir- reverent or thoughtless either, if I tell you that the words   ATHOL,.         423 that oftenest speak to my heart from the holy Book of Books-for which I am most grateful, and linger over most lovingly, waking sometimes in the solemn night-time and mingling it with my prayers--saying it reverently with a great throb of thankfulness to Heaven for the gift-that to me, even to me like unto the people of old, dwelling in the darkened wilderness and by the flowing Jordan, wait- ing with dimmed vision for the promised light, "There was a man sent from God whose name was John."
