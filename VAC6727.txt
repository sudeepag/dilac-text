                THE DIAMOND NECKLACE,  OR  A TALE   Of Interesting Incidents and Adventures, connected with the Life of a Young Nobleman, in pursuit of his Birth- Place and Parentage.    BY MRS. CHARLOTTE HLBORN.    "OWELL, MASS., 1852.     Entered according to Act of Congress in the year eighteen hundred and fifty two by Mrs.: CHARLOTTE HLBORN, in the District Court of Massachusetts.   THE DIAMOND NECKLACE,   OR THE     "The heart beats joyously in spring, When earth and all its scenes are new; And hope is out upon the wing, While all is rapture to the view." CHAPTER I.   IT was early in the summer of 184'-, that with my companion, I left the din and dust of our city home for a journey into the fresh, balmy and invigorating country. Our course for many miles, lay along the rough and rocky boundary of the broad Atlantic, where, on either hand, new and beautiful scenes, were ever unfolding to our view, like a grand panorama of all that was picturesque and sublime. Far to the north, towered the grey misty mountains, in lofty grandeur, until they seemed to rend asunder the massive clouds that rolled upward and onward, like a host of giant warriors, in the might of their steel clad armour. , n the right, the Atlantic spread out its silver sheen as far as the eye could pene- trateb upon which the sun-light sparkled and smiled through the feathery spray, until it seemed a vast plain of polished   silver, inlaid with gems and precious stones of rare and beautiful magnificence. Then the grand old forests would inter. vene, that had withstood the blasts of cen- turies; where the creeping vine and flow- ering shrubs interlaced their pliant stems, to deck the old oaks' knarled and fretted trunks; while from their leafless branches hung suspended gorgeous festoons of mosses, which the hand of time and nature had woven there. Nature's own sweet orchestra was chant; ing her richest strains; awakening to life and cheerfulness the dark shadowy vistas of the old forest, and mingling!armoni- ously with the more sober tones of the ocean wave. Smiling hills, fertile vales, fragrant shrubs and bursting flowers; music and I sunlight cheered us on every hand. Early twilight was throwing around us     her gossamer drapery, as we, after seve ral days' journey, weariedly wended ou way through the beautiful and romantic little shore town of F---, where we un expectedly met a friend of other days, wh gave us a cheerful and cordial welcom to-his pleasant and elegant home, where the remainder of the evening was spent in recalling the happy scenes of our halcyon school-days, and the pleasant associations of later life. Early the following morning we expres. sec our intention of resuming our journey "But," said our friend B- ,C You must not take your departure until you have visited some of our pleasant localities; or explored some of our pleasant little Islands, and taken an excursion over the sparkling waters of this smooth broad Bay, which seems so smilingly to invite you- oh, yes; you must visit Glenisle; it is so beautiful, with its glens and grottos, cas cades and coves; birds and flowers; with its hard smooth beach, where the whie feathery spray, mingles with shells of every hue and form; and over all, the sunlight throws such a magical web of enchant- ment. Oh! it is so beautiful, I call it the fairies' retreat."          ] "And is it not," I enquired, '; inhabited,-  save only by fairies and seanymphs?", ' Oh, yes; there are several wealthy c farmilies, residing there, a few wreckers f and an old hermit."  "A hermit;" I exclaimed, delighted f with the intelligence; for I had never  seen a hermit;) "then I will accompany  you to Glenisle, for, perhaps, I may learn Y his history, and get a subject for a fine e story. "And perhaps you may not," nswered' g our friend, ', for he is as crusty and im. penetrable as the granite hills of our own m sister State. Many have visited him from 1 curiosity, and ihave returned hone none the " wise, so far his history was concerneda" pe "Nevertheless," I answered, "I will ii tsist Glenisle, for his venerable locks, his long grey beard, his woe -bebne vsage tat and .tattered garments would be a rich sub- arc ject for-an artistist's pencil; *hy not for inte an author's pen e "-Op hs Put he never allows any one to enter i his domicile; he guards that as sacredly tr as a miser does his chest of gold; mores. foli oyer, it is situated in a remote and obscure wel part of the Island, overlooking a fearfully whi rocky coast; where many a brave heart mir nas found a watery grave."      l ; es(q   eve-' We were soon, however, equipped for our the excursion. The broad blue Bay was ntic as calm as the rest of a sleeping infant; un. not a ripple marred its surface, save only, who where the boatmens' heavy oars sent the ome dancing spray to play wild freaks of co. lere quetry amongst the wooing sunbeams. t in No sound broke the hushed tranquility yon of the scene, but the monotonous dash of ons the A'r, and the low hum of the boatmen as tihey chanted their' faiorite boat-song. res. A'charm was o'er the sea; around us, ey. above us: and the dreamy revery into 'ou which I had fallen, was only broken by ou the violent concussion of the boat aoaiinst es; the piers of our opposite landing. he The gentlemen of our party were intent on a fishing excursion; for which they y, made immediate preparations, while I was -kindly conducted by my lady friend to the only Inn, or rather place of entertainment t on the Island; where we received a hearty ;t welcome; particularly, Mrs. B ---, who, our hostess informed, had come just in ry time to be of invaluable service to her, as t a large party had unexpectedly arrived from the city; and, in consequence of the e illness of her domestic, she was unavoid. d ably without assistance." Mrs. B-- readily and cheerfully ten- dered her assistance; for they had been, Y for years, on terms of the most intimate friendship. "And while you are per. d forming the part of the good Samaritan r her," said I, addressing Mrs. B, , I wil spend a few hours in reconnoitering n your charming little Isle." To which, she : expres8ed many fears, on having me go unattended^ teliing me :t wait Until the igentlemen retu'ned to accompany me "I 'have no fears," , I answered; "while my faithful Watch-dog is by my side. But if I'd lose myself, you will probably find me somewhere oh the Island dreaming, perhaps, in some fairy's retreat; or, with- In the old Hermit's sanctum." On reaching the shore, I saw in the dis, tane; the little fishing craft ,just turning around: a -point of land which jutted out into the Bay, and making directly for-the open sea, In the same direction a noble bluf iit. tracted my vision, crowned with the dairk foliage of graceful trees; and fhither I wended my way. On reaching its summit, which was lofty and grand; y :eyes ad. miringly rested on a sceneriy moie picttur. esque and sublime than the imaginai,   in its most fanciful color ngs had ever con- ceived. There,.lay at my fee t the calm waters of the Bay, basking in the glorious efful- gence of the summer sun. Here and there, the white sails fluttered, and sped over the smooth surface, all gracefully, as a bird on the wing. There too, lay the grand old ocean, like aj giant in repose; where the heavy ships recked on its heav- ing bosom, like a tiny feather, borne along by the whispering zephyr.  There, toward the rugged cliffs of gran- ite, whitened and bleached by the dashing spray of centuries, upor whose lofty brow of adamant seemed written, "Thus far shalt thou come, and no farther." A few paces in advance of where I had been standing, and, which before had been unobserved, a small cemetery was enclosed, save only, cohere time had crumbled the grey mou dering walls; for on spelling out the almost illegible inscrip- tions, I found that many of them had been erected a century ago. Where the damp rank grass had mingled with the moss and mould, until they had despoiled the rough rude carving of much of Iits ancient beauty. It seemed a fit receptacle for the peaceful dead; and my thoughts assumed a more saddened train from the elaborate gloom of the dark heavy foliage, that hung over those ancient graves, like a mourning shroud.      I I involuntarily stopped beside an humble slab, upon which was simply inscribed,- "A stranger's grave ;" and my saddened feelings found relief in a gush of tears. For it vividly brought to mind the fate of our own valued ones-the loved and cherished brothers, who were sleeping thus, beneath a stranger's soil; where no sister's tears had ever faklen to their sacred memory. The slight rustling of the shrubbery, caused me to turn in ihe direction from whence it proceeded. But the object that met my vision sent the warm blood from my cheek and brow, tardily, and chilled through every vein. I quickly started to my feet as hat haggard form, with unshorn locks, and beard, white as the fleecy snow, approached me. For fear, at that moment, was paramount to every other emotion. "Fear not lady," he said, in a low tremu- lous voice, as if divining my thoughts, "I am no spectre, as you m ay suppose, from those ancient graves; for I have not   yet thrown off this mortal coil; but daily wander thither, invited by the sublime beauty and tranquility of the scene, for contemplation. Your tears called forth my sympathy;, for I am never deaf to sorrow, "Have you friends mouldering beneath these silent shades?" "I have not, sir," I answered; "I am a stranger here; and it is only by accident that I have visited this spot, consecrated to the silent dead." "Then,"' he continued, "you have drank from the cup of sorrow?" "Aye, deeply, deeply, and many of that household band, unbroken in my child- hood, are sleeping thus," I answered, pointing to the stranger's grave. "For- saken arind alone." "No matter," he said, "where the casket is broken; if we but possess again the gem it contained." "Mine too, has been a life of sorrow. The sport of fate, dark, mysterious and unfathomable. They call me the Hermit, but when heart answers to heart, and soul to soul, I mingle with my fellow men. Where sorrow, misfortune, or cries of distress arrest my ear; my heart gushes with sympathy, and my hand is ever ex- tended in kindness. But when the eyes of curiosity, pride, or scorn are peering upon me: I am the Recluse of Glenisle. Not from choice, I will own, for I have loved the world; or rather, the things that pertain to it. Aye, and love them yet, with almost idolatrous devotion. But the winds and the waves, the cun- ning and vicious devises of men; the smiles or frowns of fate; or a dark mys- terious Providence has placed me here; I have only awaited their bidding to re- turn." "Singular old man ;"I mentally ex- claimed, as I glanced fearfully towards him. But his dark and almost painfully piercing eye savoured not of insanity, for the expression was lofty, animated and highly intelligent, as if lit up by the fires, of youth, contrasting strangely with the white flowing locks and venerable beard; which consealed with such pleasing grace, the furrows of time and sorrow upon his haggard brow. "There," he continued, pointing to an humble grave, upon which a carefully cul- tivated moss rose tree was in full bloom; "there, for many long years, I have daily knelt, and prayed, and wept. Believing     that beneath that turf, the beautiful idol of my heart was mouldering." "Ah," he said, as I anxiously bent for- ward in a listening attitude, while my eye, lighted up with expectancy, ," you would learn my history; but that, Madam, is not yet completed. Nevertheless, I will de- tail to you some of the events of the past and Heaven alone knows what the future has in store for me. CHAPTER II. "'Tis but a dream! 'tis but a dream! yet one I would not change For any bright reality, within this wide world's range, Eexcept its own- and that to know--I should be too much blest. A silent voice still whispers me - Oh! Heaven's decrees  are best!' I WAS born; ah! I cannot tell you ' where I was born. But I have a faint t recollection of a magnificent castle, with I marble floors and polished mirror ceilings; t of halls, where sculptor and and art had e placed their choicest works, until they p seemed hung with living, breathing images, d divinely and transcendantly beautiful. c A youthful looking gentleman, withd noble mien, often led me through those fe galleries of art and beauty, so enchanting i to my childish fancy, accompanied by a fa mild gentle lady, with a graceful ,sylph- to like form, almost etherial, and a face upon which it seemed an angel had placed its su signet. They called me their child, their di cherished idol, as they fondly caressed me e with parental tenderness.       cc One day, I recollect,- ah! I shall m never forget that day,-my father presen. w ted my mother with a magnificent dia. mond necklace. I was, already dressed a for a stroll in the pleasure grounds and m park with my nurse; but the dazzling to brilliancy of that diamond chain tempted he me so powerfully, that I desired my au mother to twine it around my neck until I ob returned. But she did not seem inclined fa to gratify my wishes, until my tears and pil caresses, with the intercession of my we father, prevailed; and with many admoni- ] tions to the nurse for my safety, she gave ap me the parting caress.        the We wandered through the broad ave. ha nues, where gorgeous flowers were srniling boy in the sunlight, and nodding gracefully to tha   of the gentle zephyrs, which sighed around us, ladened with the sweet fragrance they Dr- had borrowed from shrubs and flowers of re, aromatic beauty. ld  Soon, we had reached the border of the lot grand old park, where a clear crystial le- fountain sent its spacting jets above us, t; dancing in the sunlight, until its pearly re drops rivalled, in matchless brilliancy, the glittering diamonds my childish tears had won. So charmed and delighted was I with the magnificent scene before me, that I knew not that my nurse had carelessly wandered away,until a rough hand was laid upon me, and 1 felt myself raised from my Id seat, and borne along with frightful rapid- ity, through the dark, shadowy windings of the gloomy park. Do I dared not struggle to free myself, for es the dark visage and fierce expression of her, within whoes grasp I was firmly held, deprived me of strength and utterance, u and I tremblingly buried my face within it the folds of my rich and jewelled drapery. h Many long, weary days I was carried ; through gloomy forests and stealthy cov- d erts. One dark, stormy night, they stop- ped for rest. It was the first they had , dared to take since I had beome their captive, and it was within the silent i depths of a vast wilnerness, where the foot of man had never before left its e impress; far, far away from where my father's castle towered in lofty grandeur to the skies. Here that gipsey band held a long con- sultation, and after depriving me of the diamond chain, which I struggled hard to retain, they laid me upon a hard, rough couch for repose, telling me that with the morrow's sun, they should resume their weary march. At early dawn, I was awakened from a profound slumber, by the wild, noisy mirth of that strolling band, and requested to survey myself in a glass which they held before me; but I quickly turned away in horror and disgust, from  the object that met my sight, and buried my face in the rags that had served for my pillow, and wept as though my little heart would burst with grief and indignation. They had completely changed my whole appearance, and so successful had been their art, that my own parents would never have recognized their delicate flaxen-haired boy, in the dark, sooty, disfigured visage that met my startled vision.   I besought them with childish artlessness to take nme back to my parents, telling them that my father would give them many, very many beautiful things, if they would give him back his boy . But they answered; scornfully, that we were many leagues from my father's cas- tle, and the proud'Earl of Lavarre would never again behold the. noble heir of his vast domains. And many other things they said which I have forgotten, and many more which I could not understand, as' they struck their tents, and took up their line of march through gloomy for- ests and dark ravines, where the rays of the glorious sunlight rarely ever penetra- ted, to light the dismal scene. One evening, after a long and fatiguing journey, and many months from the time that they took me from my father's crys- tal fountain, a contention arose between them concerning the diamond chain, of which my gipsy mother claimed herself the sole possessor, which neither their fawning flatteries, nor menacing threats, would cause her to relinquish, and for which she and myself were rudely ejected from that hateful group. We crossed the deep and broad waters, and landed on the American shore, in a large, beautiful city, Where for many days she begged from the strangers' door, to satisfy the cravings of want and hunger. One dark winter evening, When the cold blasts of frozen sleet swept rudely by, chilled and benumbed by hunger and ex- posure, we sought the friendly enclosure of a rich man's door, to shield us from the ruthless blasts of winter. On the cold marble step that gipsy wanderer seated herself, and covered me with the scanty garments that shrouded her form, and wept. Aye, she wept as I had never seen her weep, before, and hushed my low, feeble moanings for food, until at last, I fell into a sweet and quiet slumber. On ihe following morning, I was aroused from a sweet, dreamy repose, by a soft, musical voice, and on drowsily opening my eyes, saw a form of almost surpassing loveliness bending over me, while the pearly tear drops sparkled in her eyes, falling like glittering diamonds upon the frozen sleet that crested the marble stone upon which I was reclining. I looked wildly and anxiously around me, but she that had screened me from the cold winter's blast was not there. She had gone, I knew not whither.   My eyes were filled with the gushings of sorrow, and my little heart throbbing with pain of distress, when a servent who had been summoned made his appearance, and carried me within the warm, congenial apartments of a rich man's home. Here I was divested of the rags and filth which had served for my clothing, and dressed in garments of a soft and beauti- ful texture, and when again that kind and gentle lady beheld me, her eyes beamed with tenderness, and her delicate arms embraced me with almost maternal affec- tion. But I wept many a day for my dark eyed gipsy mother, and wondered if she would not again return to claim me; for I had learned to love her, as if she had in reality been the mother of my life and being. Years flew happily by, within that home of affluence, that had sheltered me, a poor, friendless boy, from the griping hand of hunger and starvation, and the pitiless blasts of winter. And the past was for- gotten, or remembered only as a dream of my childish fancy. But before I had arrived at maturity, my kind guardian had gently passed away to the spirt world, leaving me a hadsome competency, free from any claim or cumbrance of legal heirship. CHAPTER IIT. "Surely as drop the sands of time, Misfortunes will come, And disappointment, and purifying trial." AGAIN I became a wanderer, but not I the poor, friendless outcast, the filthy, t starving wanderer of other days, but a wan- derer in high life, where servants came at I the bidding, and masters bowed obsequi- ously to wait my pleasure. The halls of wealth and grandeur were thrown open for my reception, and from" courts and palaces I was not ejected. My pasport was wealth, a never failing sesanme to pride and royality. ' I was not, in reality, in possession of great wealth; but I had assumed its ap- i pearance, and taken this course in order e to find my parents, if, indeed, the recollec- e tion of the past were not a dream of wild and fanciful imagery; and I felt that they     were not so; for they had grown with my growth; and so vividly did the, scene of my childhood, with the loved ones that so fondly smiled upon and caressed me, open to my glowing vision, that I felt that I should not be deceived, if. Providence should again direct me to their locality. And for that purpose I visited many portions of Europe, its lordly halls and towering palaces. I have sailed over the noble Thames, where castle and' dome on either hand, rose loftily and frowningly above me.  I have visited the Lowlands and the Highlands of Scotland, have: traversed all wearily its bonnaiBurns, and rested on the banks of the winding Dee and silvery Don. I have climbed the summit of Lam- mermuir, and quaffed the nectarine of. its odorous zephys. I have wandered beneath the smiling skies of Italy, where: the Mediteranean's wave laves the spicy, vine-clad shore. . I have threaded the course of the beautiful Arno, and laved my burning brow in the flowing Tiber's wave, and sat dreamily beneath its golden moonlight, when castle and cottage, fores's and glens, rivers and lakes, seemed bathed in a flood of golden lava, listening to the enchanting melodies of the Gondoliers as they rested upon their oars, until the present was forgotten, and I was a child again at my father's fountain, toying with the diamond chain that sparkled midst the folds of my jewel- ed drapery. But in all my travels I could never find any trace of my noble parentage. No one had ever heard of the Earl of La- varre, or his princely castle. I, therefore, reluctantly abandoned my fruitless search as an idle dream, a wild  fanciful romance of childhood, and came  to the determination to return again to the : land of my adoption, with the conviction that the dark-eyed wandering gipsey, who i deserted me on that cold winter's morn- ] ing, was the mother of my being, as well as the author of my sad misfortune. I One evening I had travelled .far away 6 from the beautiful city of Florence in a t thoughtful mood, deliberating on my best i future course to pursue, noticing neither X time nor the distance I had travelled, whent I suddenly found myself overtaken by a night-fall in the midst of a dense forest, which, for many years, had been infested f by a band of bold and daring Banditti. t I was just reigning in my noble steed    y to retrace my homeward course, when the f rumbling of carriage wheels rapidly ap. o proaching, arrested my ear and caused me t, to look in the. direction from whence it t proceeded. Through the overhanging branches, where the' moonbeams fitfully penetrated, I could discern, not far in the r distance, an elegant coach and horses richly caparisoned.   I was congratulating myself on my good i fortune, in having a companion through r the. wild dense forest, when the sharp elick of pistols reverberated through its gloomy shadowsi immnediately followed by 1 a tall athletic form from his stealthy cov- ert, whose sinewy arm grappled, with gi. ant strength, the bridles of the frightened horses, and with a stentorian voice, de- 3manded the money, or life of those be- nighted travellers. In a moment I comprehended all; and as quick as thought hurried the spurs deep Iinto the flanks of my noble steed and flew to the rescue. But before I had arrived another report of his murderous weapon resounded through the gloom of night, followed by a deep groan, and the wild pleadings of despair from the soft silvery tones of a female voice. ' Stand, coward," I cried, as I reached the scene of action, laying one hand heav- ily upon the shoulders of that daring out- law, while with the other, I held my well poised pistol over the nodding plume. "Stand coward; .who art thou that darest intercept the peaceful progress of :benighted travellers." .As I spoke he turned quickly towards me, and confront- ing me with a look of contempt and scorn- ful rage, he answered, "I am Biraldo, the Banditt's Chieftain; and many a braver heart than yours has quailed beneath the weight of my sinew arm."? As he spoke he raised his glittering sword with a haughty menace, above my head. "Stay," I reiterated, as I drew my polished steel from its place of safety.- "Stay, Brigand Chieftain; I will teach thee that my own good arm has power to wield a weapon as well as thine own,"- and I parried successfully his well aimed thrust, and drove him with infuriated rage at bay. At this defeat he became fearfully in- furiated, while I seemed transformed into the image ofa sporting tiger. Thrust after thrust was given on either   side, and for a while the contest seemed  equally sustained. But in parrying a blow, which was aimed directly at my heart, my own good sword gave him a thrust which  sent him reeling to the ground. ' Curses upon thee, thou son of a plebi-  an race," he muttered, ",know that thy doom is sure. Brave men await the bid- ding of their master, and his death will be fearfully revenged." He raised a whistle to his lips and was in' the: act of sounding  it, when, with the quickness of thought, I sprang forward and wrenched it from his grasp.    '  Foiled in his last expectation, and inci- ted to desperation, he sprang like a npad- dened demon from the bloody turf,-but a sudden faintness overpowered him, and he fell back a hideouscorps'at my feet.- For a mroment I bent trerriblingly over him, but life was already extinct; the mighty heavings of that dauntless. heart laid still and silent in the cold embrace of death. A stifled sob: from the carriage aroused me from the fearful stupor into which I had fallen, and I hastily proceeded to the scene of suffering and sorrow. The moon was shining out all radiantly beautiful from a clear overarching sky, displaying the form and figure of a young girl of angelic loveliness, with a cheek and brow pale as marble, upon which in- nocence sat enthroned in her beautiful at- tire, contrasting strangely with the fearful, loathsome scene I had:just witnessed. She .seemed like a guardian angel, as she bent tearfully and droopingly over the senseless form of an aged gentlemen, up- on whose brow was the palor and sem- blance of death. As a glimpse of my shadow crossed her vision she uttered a thrilling prayer for mercy, pointing pleadingly and disparingly to the bleeding senseless form which she was vainly striving to support.. "Fear me not, lady^"I said in a sooth- ing voice. Providence has sent me to your assistance, and he who would have wantonly deprived you of life, lies himself a bleeding, mangled corpse upon yonder turf." "God be praised," she said, as she rev- erently raised her beautiful eyes to Heav- en, " and He will surely reward the gen- erous deeds of your valiant arm., But I fear he has deprived my dear and only parent of his precious life; his wound bleeds profusely, and if aid is not imme-   diately procured, Heaven alone knows what may be the result. I have been lay., ing in a swoon ever since the first encoun- ter 'and you, my dear, dear father," she said, pressing her white lips upon his pal- lid brow, " you have been passing unat- tended to the spirit world." "Fly, fly Marcus," she continued, as if inspired by a sudden thbught, to the coach- man; who having secreted himself, in the first encounter, just then made his appear- ance, " speed thee to my father's villa, to Oswold Hall; the distance is not great after we leave this infested forest. Speed thee, Marcus," she reiterated, for he stood like a senseless idiot, gazing on the fright. ful scene before him. "Speed thee, Marcus, or those forest hounds will scent the blood of their mas- ter, and revenge his death upon us with four-fold cruelty. Can nothing be done for my father?" she anxiously enquired, as I bent over him, vainly endeavoring to staunch the profusion of blood which flow- ed from a deep hideous wound. Not much, I fear lady," I answered, "until a surgical operation is performed to extract the ball. It is a frightful wound, and God grant it may not prove fatal; we will, at least, hope for the best." "' Take courage lady, I said; " we have cleared the forest, and shall soon be at Oswold Hall?"For I remembered hav- ing passed a grand old baronial seat, on my way to the forest, and I doubted not it was the same. Another half hour's ride of rapid driving, brought us to the Villa; where surgical aid was immediately pro- cured, and the wound skilfully dressed. But there he lay, through the long silent vigils of the night; pale, senseless and still; as though death had already placed his signet upon his heart and brow. I was bending over him, when the first rays of the morning's sunlight, stole softly through the crimsoned oriel windows, that lighted the grand old baronial apartment; and as their shadows fell upon the richly em- broidered velvet that draped his gorgeous couch, I felt a slight tremulous motion of his feeble pulse; and as the heavy lids, slightly parted from his pallid cheek; he whispered, scarcely audible: "Fransolina, beloved daughter; where art thou?" Fransolina was kneeling, bathed in tears, by his bedside. I gently placed her hand in that of her parent, and whispered, " she is safe, she still lives to nurse and comfort you."     Fransolina pressed her cheek, pale as the parian marble to that of her father's and breathed softly into his ear words of sweet, holy and affectionate encourage ment. A smile of'paternal love and thankful ness ovespread his calm features; and he sank into a sweet, gentle and quiet slum. ber. CHAPTER IV. "When love fails to give life, it consumes its possessor Robed in humility, it knows not gold. True love is a fever, Which knows no antidote but death  Say not that it is transitory,-for God himself is Love. It gloweth in eternal realms, Its lyre breathes out a music that can never die."  FRANSOLINA, pale as a drooping lilly, I wearily bent her head far down upon the  magnificent couch where her father wast gently reposing; and the long rich masses  of dark brown hair fell negligently from her pale smooth brow, mingling witching-  ly with the heavy fringes and tassels of it gold and silver which glittered 'mongst the it deep heavy folds of the rich drapery, un o til it seemed to my young, ardent and t glowing imagination, a place of enchant. m ment,-and she the peerless fairy queen, in her robes of royalty, with the crown of regal sparkling with gams and diamonds m upon her pure and matchless brow.  Hour after hour, I watched the quietm repose of the invalid father as a fond moth. I er guards the peaceful slumbers of her br only child. When I looked upon the peer a less and almost etheriel beauty of his cher ve ished daughter, her pure lips parted with  a heavenly smile, and the long drooping ed lashes resting heavily upon her soft pale cheek, gemmed with the tears of hope and me love, my eyes grew dim with admiration, be and my heart throbbed  with emotions bu strange and perplexing.        wr A love, deep, inspiring and holy, perva.  ded my heart and soul, for the fair uncon. for scious being before me, in all the modest ste purity and matchless gi ace of innocence wh and youth. It was a rash, wild passion; and the winds that sighed audibly through the frowning battlements above me seem- wh ed to whisper ominously in my ear. But voi they were soon forgotten, or expelled from hi my throbbing heart, as I looked upon that for   as beautiful form which seemed itself an em. r's, anation of divinity. 3 of I felt that I could hazard a thousand ge. lives,could I but restore to her the life of her venerable parent could I but restore ul- to that angel of purity and loveliness, the he gushings of hope and joy as in other days. m. If she was matchless in the beauty of 'her pensive sadnessi what must she be when her large beautiful eyes were lighted up with the bright 'rays of innocent joy, and her' heart 'gushing from the fulness, of youthful emotions. And, oh,could I but call that combination , of all that was beautiful my own; could I but press :her to my throbbing heart and fee the answering echo of her own truth. loving heart answering to mine. But no; -that cannot be. A barrier is raised high above us which neither love, nor dispair can level. She, within whose veins the blood of y, royalty is' freely' coursing, and upon ie whose fair brow has been placed its regal s title; myself the son of mystery, or, :s i perhaps, the unholy offspring of a gipsy n mother. The thought was maddening. My soul was burning as though the scorching if loi of a thousand eruptions had entered e it. I paced depairingly the carpeted floor - of titled royality, whose soft, yielding I texture scarcely sent back the sound of my impatient footsteps. ,  I resolved; aye vowed, from the depths of my rent and anguished heart to pursue my travels, and if was the son of aught but the hated gipsy 'ace; if my father, my t mother, their ancestry, or posterity lived, I would search them out, if I traversed the broad expanse of the universe. I sent up a mental, though heartfelt prayer to Heai- ven's throne, that my efforts might be speedily accomplished and surely reward. ed. A low murmur from the Baron aroused me from  my revery. I hastened to his bedside, and pressed to his parched and burning lips a goblet of wine and water; which greatly revived him. He looked wildly around him, enquired for his daughter, and after surveying me steadily for a moment, enquired,-"To whom am I indebted for this kind atten- tion?" But before I could answer, Fransolina, who had been aroused by her father's voice, pressed her lips gently to his, and while tears afjoy and thankfulness gushed forth from her beaming eyes, answered,   "To our preserver, and next to high'st Heaven our thankfulness is due to him i for the timely aid of his valiant arm, and our miraculous escape from the Banditt's B power in the lone forest."      e "But you forget, Fransolina, in your n excess of joy, that he deserves greater and st more substantial remuneration than merely M the heart and lip's empty tribute of grati- tude."                e "Far be it fro i me, most noble sir," I answered, " to accept the least remuner- li ation for dischargihg my duty to a fellow- y man, and saving, through the God in whom t I trust, the lives of innocent beings, and of  ridding the world bf one who was obnox- I ious and hateful to the race of men. I am f amply rewarded for my weak services, in I seeing you thus rapidly. recovering from r the effects of your wound, and beholding a the light of joy and gladness illuminating ^ the fair brow of purity and innocence."  "Will you favor me with your name, v sir," asked the Baron, "that I may bet-  : ter know to whom I am so gratefully in- debted." "My name, sir Baron, is Frederic Har- I clay, or rather," I continued hesitatingly,  "-it is the name my adopted father be-  stowed upon me." "Then," continued the Baron, "you  are an orphan." "And that I cannot answer you correct- ly, sir; there is a mystery about my birth and parentage, which I have never been able to solve." "Ha!" said the Baron, half musingly, as his keen eye rested enquiringly upon me. But a glan-e told him that he had touched on a painful subject,-and then as if wishing to' change the subject, so painful to my feelings, he enquired my present pursuit, and how it happened that I so providentially saved them from the Banditt's power. I answered him, " that I was travelling, and the beauty of the evening had invited me forth from the city, to a ride in the pleasant country; and having given my mind to the sweet, soothing inspirations, which surrounded me, I heeded not the distance until I found myself far advanced in the gloomy fdrest, with the dark shad- ows of evening closing rapidly around me. I had just reined in my steed to return, when the sound of your carriage wheels attracted my attention, quickly followed -by the report of a pistol. I felt the danger of your situation, and resolved, in' the   strength of Heaven, to assist you, or die in the endeavor." ," And Heaven did assist you," said the Baron, "and may it reward you more effectually than the wealth or power of man can do. But," he continued, " you said you were travelling,-may I ask for what purpose?" "Partially for pleasure, sir," I answer. ed. "But I have an object in view." "Then," he continued, his noble brow lighting up with true benevolence, t"I may yet hope to be of service to you. But for the present it is my wish that you make Oswold Hall your home and residence.- Remain with me, kind sir, until I recover from this unfortunate disaster, or, if the Lord wills it, until I go to rest with my noble ancestors. This old baronial seat abounds with works of curiosity and art, where you will find much to amuse and divert your mind from the dreariness which ever attends the dull monotony of an invalid's chamber. I am weary now," he continued, lan- guidly, as he turned restlessly upon his pillow, "and will rest awhile,-but re- member, sir, it is my wish that you re- main at the castle. No hand like yours, and that of my loved Fransolina's can so gently smooth my pillow, or sooth the dreariness of these restless hours. Fran- solina, daughter mine, go to the cabinet and bring from thence my sketch book for our friend's perusal; it may serve to while away pleasantly the otherwise dull hours of my repose." I "But you forget, my dear father," said Fransolina, "or rather you do not know that he has taken neither refreshment ) nor repose since he entered the castle, and it is now past mid-day." Lt  Is it possible," enquired the baron, with deep emotions of gratitude. "Noble sir," he continued, pressing my hand warmly within his feeble grasp, "the d goodness of your generous and virtuous heart far surpasses the valor of your dauntless arm. Go Fransolina," he said, again addressing his daughter, " order an attendant to direct him immediately to the chamber adjoining my own. Thither let the choicest refreshments be carried and there let him find a sweet and tran- quit repose. Ah, my children you both need repose,-leave me with an attendant and seek weary nature's sweet restorer." "Oh, no!" quickly responded Franso- lina, her voice soft and tremulous with     emotion, , I have already enjoyed several hours of undisturbed repose, while our friend has lept his lonely vigils :by your bedside; I would in my turn enjo the. felicity of administering to the necessities of a loyed and only parent." "Ah!" said the baron, hisa eyes dim with the emotions that welled up from his gushing heart, "God must, He will reward the filial devotion, the disinterested. love you have manifested, my children; and may He, in rewarding that devotion, re- store me to health to complete your hap- piness." CHAPTER V.        1 But shall not hearts united here, In strongest ties of love,  Still meet when all life's ills shall close t In brighter Worlds above.   I FOR several weeks the baron seemed steadily and surely recovering, so much s so that at the expiration of that time, he b was able, with the assistance of my arm E to take daily turns on the balcony; and a often he would repair with me to the plea ai sant grounds which adorned his magnifi- a cent castle. ' But when the autumn winds came rev. be elling through the rich deep foliage of the m grand old park, changing its sombre hue yo to the rich dyes of the gilded rainbow, and it. touching here and there, all so delicately re the deeply blushing flowers that drooped, pa all pale and withered, upon the parent the stem,-then the baron sought no more the of trellaced walks of his fragrant grounds. els For a more deadly palor was on his yo cheek, save only when the heetic flush the mantled it with fearful brilliancy. Con. fro sumption was there, for the low hollow hav cough told the fearful tale. One day,after had been reading to him for several hours,he requested me to close the book and take a seat by his side. I He pressed my hand tenderly as I took teriE the proffered seat, and said, with a look itor full of undisguised sympathy,    ever "Young friend, I have taken a strange  and uncontrollable interest in your wel. shal fare; an interest which a tender father bent might proudly eherish for an only son.-- .F And yet, there is a mystery about you myi which I would have you unravel, if it dee would not cause you too much pain. Be. air o   eral lieve me, sir, it is not from motives of our mere curiosity that I ask this; but I would ionfuene you extensive; I  m  f our have you confide ein me as though I were the indeed your father and rightful adviser.- - ities You recollect our conversation the morn. ing after myh misfortun; you hinted the dim uncertainty of your parentage, and have his ever since then studiously avoided any ap- proach to it. You havelf will own, exci- ted my curiosity, but I have more power- ful and weighty reasons for learning your history. I have wealth at my commad and my inluence is extensive; I maydo much for you. Will you unreservedly give me the full and true history of your' life, from I stammered and hesitated for I did not wish to deprive myself of the good opinion the baron had manifested towards me, and I feared I should do so were I to trace back my lineage to a noble house. d  It was the height of presumption, ab. h surdity and folly; for as yet I had never ie been able to find the least trace of the l, Earl of Lavarre, or'his noble estate. But d a'look full of meaning from athe baron, t- aroused mie from my reflections, andI i- answered, "Most noble sir, my hesitation has not - been from a desire to withhold from you avmy confidence, my entire confidence, for you have a just and perfect right to claim ,it. I will withhold nothing from you in relation to the mysterious events of my, past life, although you may deem them the mere fabrications of fancy, the effects " of presumption, absurdity, or any thing else you please. Buton e thing I ask of you, that you will hear rpe patiently to the conclusion; that y  rou wil not withdraw from me the good opinion with which you havebeen pleased to honor me, nor con. demn me as an iposter, as one seeking fof the favors and honors of nobility, de. void of legal pretentions. It is to you alone that I unfold the mys. teries of my life, and'in the sacred depos- itory of your own heart I pray they may ever remain." "And upon my sacred honor they shall," answered the baron, ".unless y can benefit you by a disclosure., 'For a few moments after I had brought my story' to a conclusion, the baron sat in deep thought. At length he said with an sir of cheerfulness,   "My young friend, I think your story a very plausible one and not'the mere fab- rication of childish fancy; that I think would have 'been impossible, or not Very piobable, surrounded is you were by only the lower'grades of humanity. Had it not 'been a 'reality you never could havei so accuately fancied and de- scribed the gorgeous interior of a lordly castle, its galleries of art, its cabinets 'of. curiosities, its noble halls, its spacious apartments', its parks and fountains. Believe me, bir, tiere "Wa artifice deep and revengeful at the bttf'or, in which I should think the old 'iurse with whom you Were intrusted, was deeply complicated.-. But I thinrk there iS a' probability of your being mistaken in 'the mem of your father, the Earl, ydubeiing 's very young at the time of your capture. I have never leen familiar with thatt name, and I have known many lords' and nobles; but thie'seeiery you liave describ- ed seems to me like ahalf tfrgdoitet dream. Ah! I do recollect," he continued, after a moment's silence, " while travelling some few years since in the western part of Scotland, of visiting 'an old castle, which was their, and had' been for severl' years,' unoccupied by the master. -But think ybu that you would recognize the scenes of your childhood, if ProVidence should 6ver again dir6et ydu to their locality?" "Indeed; sir,"'I answered, "I think I should. They seem so indellibly stamped upon my m6 mory, that I could-' ot be mistaken.. h! that I could once more behold: tftn; that I could once m6te ei. B'ace the' trUe auihors of my existeice were they of hlumble or 'noble birth,--I could fall down and worship them with the deepest and holiest veneration and love," And Heaven gtantthat you may again t'eholed theans ered tebron. 'My purse is at your disposal whenever you choose to leave OswoldHlall. But I re- qiest, as a favor,; that you will rieain with me a littte' lioger. My health' tid strength is rapidlyi declining, and I have a foreboding that my time is short. You "Shall loose nothing 'y the delay, for I will make ample amends for your generosity and kindness. ' "Noble sir," I Answered, ," I demand no recotripense; I am already 'under a thousand-obligations to you for the interest you have taken in my welfare, which I can never repay, save only by a life devoted to your will and pleasure. That, sir, is   yours with the truthful devotion of my heart; talk not to me of recompense when I alone am the debtor." '"Your heart is noble,' answered the baron " and I priZeits devotion, and may God reward you as you deserve, and re- store to you again the fond embrace"of 'parental love and happiness." Some few weeks after the above con- vOteation, I was taliing my usual walk around the castle gr6unds, With my tnind 'tinusually depressed fromemotions of a conflicting nature.' Now, recalling the Varied 'ad mysterious scenes of the past; now dwellingon the present of sortro and gloom; For sorrow deep and'truthful per- vaded my soil with the conviction that a 'few weeks more and my friend, the baron, my father, and counsellor, must bid adieu to the scenes of earth for the gloomy and lasting repose -of death. And Fransolina, my heart bled afresh, as her angelic form, her face of pure 'and mathlesi'beauity 'oe up befoie me, droop. ing and' pale, from the intensity of her deep and heart-felt sorrow. Th'e time was apprbaching when 1 could no longer worship her!at an humble 'dis. tance from the silent depths of a heart gushirig with love and adoration. I had never dared to breathe my love to 'te peerless being who had awakened it fibo ithe deepest and holiest recesses of imyheart.' I could never dare aspire 'to 'the liand' of Fransolina, the descendant of 'a iibble house; but I coild never for- get, or cease to love, such a coifibiiatibn of all tiht was so beautiful and lovely. I imust love on hopelessly and dispiringly; but fbi get- never. 'Then a faint glitritering of hope worid cheer'y ly gloomy imaginings, that I might yet be restored- to ny noble parentage; that I might yet; with Equal claims' to roy- ally and nobility, ask the hand of the loved and fair inchantress of my heart and sdiit. While Pnyi rhin'd 'aas thus agitated With hiOe'i ddoifititing emotions, a servant 'ip- p'eard' and announced to me that the ba- ton desired my presence. I immediately ' obebyed the sutnrinois and iWhen I entered his apartment he was feebly reclining up- on his luixurious couch, and by his side bat Fransolina, tearful and pale, as a drooping lilly. He: took my hand and pressed it with all the tenderness of an affectionate father, as he said, "I have a strange request to make to you Frederick, which may seem beyond     the bounds of right and honor, and which you may think will draw largely upon your confidence and credulity. Nevertheless I wish you to answer me truly, as though the salvation of your soul rested upon the result. And this is the request,--do yo love my daughter Fransolina?" "My noble lord," I ejaculated, as I scarcely knowing what I did, fell upon my knees by his side, " spare me this, I be. seech you; in naught else have I withheld my confidence; in all else I will serve you, but spare my heart's sorrows and the idols which I have sacredly worshipped within 1 my own bosom."    , "I do not wish to trifle with your feel- t ings, with the sacred emotions of your heart, my young friend," cntinuedthe baron. "Yet I would have you answer my s question unreservedly, which I solemnly h repeat,-do you love Fransolina of Os. wold?"  "Love her, sir," I answered, "nay, I , adore her, in the sacred and. silent recesses c of my heart; and who can behold an an c gel of celestial beauty and grace, and not s bestow upon them the heart's adoration.- t It is only thus that I have dared to love the sh peerless maiden of Oswold; it is onl  thus that I have dared to lool into the pai  ful and hopeless future. If I have erred chide me not; mine was not the fault.- an And yet she must ever be the sacred idol mi of my heart, the beautiful enchantress of i my soul, which can never be supplante by another."  "Fransolina, my daughter, continued  :the baron, with evident emotion, "yo te have witnessed his confession of love, ofhe hopeless love; and now, my child, I must ing ask you a similar question, and I wish you V to answer me with the same sincerity and  truthfulness which he has manifested.-. Iw For many months this young gentleman wh has been an inmate of our home; I think " you have not been blind to his merits, and loc have often spoken of our obligations to w his valor and generosity. Now tell mehis my daughter, if you approve of him so f high!y as to receive him for your compan. ion through. life. I think he is worthy ofine my Fransolina. But far be it trom me to you desire her to give her hanJ whre she can- vers not bestow' the sacred love of her virtuous nupti heart. My daughter it remains for you to  decide this point." For a moment Fransolina pressed her whole cheek to the pale brow of her noble father; my   which land when she again raised it, it was with your 'blushing modesty, and with some degree eless of embarrassment and confusion. In a ough soft tremulous voice she answered i the "My honored father, it gives me plea- you sure to comply. with your wishes; for your wishes I know they are. Without is i, doing violence to my own feelings and my inclination, next to God I am indebted to be. him for the life which I now enjoy. The held pure sacred love of my heart is given in you, exchange for his. Shall I withhold my iols hand from him to whom alone, from all hin. the world, I can ever bestow the sacred love of my heart. Love levels all distinc. el   . tions; I would freely renounce titles and our royalty for the happiness of one to whom the we are so sacredly indebted." "Heaven bless you, m'y daughter," my said the baron, as he took her trembling sly hand and placed it within that of my own. )s "Fredric Harclay," he said, with all the 'solemnity of a dying man, "to your I keeping I commit a sacred charge. Re- es ceive her as the gift of Heaven, love and mn cherish- her next, to the salvation of your lot soul, next to the God whom you profess to serve. To her I leave the legal heir. he ship of Oswold; where, it is my wish, ly that you may lovingly and happily re- n main." d,  So suddenly and unexpectedly was this announcement broken upon me, that my uo mind could scarcely comprehend its true Df import. d  I was in a delirium of joy and uncer. tainty. I pressed her hand cpnvqlsively to my lips, and bathed 't with my gushing tears, till the conflicting emotions of my f heart overpowered me, and I sank faint- ing at her feet. When 1 recovered the man of God, in Ihis clerical dress, was bending over, me. I was vainly striving to collect my thoughts, when ith voice of the Baron groused me. "My son," he said, "this will be a gloomy bridal for the daughter of a Peer. I would it were otherwise. But God, in his own good pleasure, overrules all things for the best. ":I am  desirous to witness your hap. piness, my children; and to bestow upon you my dying blessing. Whea the anni- versary of this day arrives celebrate your nuptials, as becomes your rank and station in life ;, but until then, let it be kept a pot. found secret from all the world, save him, who pronounces you legally united. It is my wish, nay,-command, that you re.   sume your travels, .and continue them until the anniversary of this day ap. preaches. While my daughter, in the  'meantime, avails herself of the protection of Lord Fitshenry, a, distant relative of i mine. May God bless; you, my son; and i restore you in safety to your bride, with equal claims to birth and fortune with her own." Not long after our lonely bridal the good old Baron took his, peaceful exit from the scenes of ife, and was carried to rest with his noble ancestors.  ; But it. was long ere I could summon strength to quit the castle;. which had be- come sacred to my heart, from the joys and sorrows I had known beneath its friendly roof.     , It was torture. to think of leaving my beautiful bride,- Bride of my heart, life of my soul; to leave her,--delicate as a fragile flower, sensitive, as the quivering aspen, to a stranger's care, A dark, fearful foreboding took p-sses- session of my whole nature; which neither the smiles of my ,r ide,.nor thP bright prospects of an unclouded future, which she so glowingly described, could dispel. But the command Was imperative.; the command of my more than father;. it was his last injuction, and must, and should be obeyed.      I CHAPTER VI. '"Yet, midst this e of mirth and glee, I marked a fiend f, villain smille; ' Like Eden's serpent, artfully, '  By blandishment, who lured to guile." AT last I took a tearful adieu of the shades of Oswold  and, accompapied Fransolina to the seat of her relative, Lord Fitshenry; where she was received with every demonstration of joy;, much more, I thought, than the circumstances and occasion of her yisit demanded. . . They condoled with hier on the death, of her venerable parent, the Brpn;l ,but to me, their condolence seemed more of the lips than the heart. Lord Fitshenry was father of a numer- ous fimily, who were vainly endeavoring to makle an advantageous display of a small fortune. His sons were proud, ar- rogant and conceited. The daughters vain, frivolous and heartless.   But Fitzhenry did not, or rather did not ippear to see their inferiority and defects; for whenever he could gain a hearing from Pransolina, he would speak of his sons in glowing terms; expatiate on the super- iority of their talents, their noble merits, the chivalry of their exploits; and he hoped that she would participate in the innocent sports of his gay family, and mingle with them in the scenes and pleasures of fashionable life. A deeper shade of sadness overspread Fransolina's brow, as she answered,- "Sir, I am not here a 'seeker for pleasure; save that which I can derive from the strictest seclusion and retirement. It was for that purpose, in compliance with my lamented father's wishes, that I sought the protection of your mansion. And while I remain your guest, I pray you will excuse me from mingling in the scenes of mirth, and heartless pleasures; which, at present, is most foreign from my wishes and inclinations." Fransolina would have gladly returned again to the loneliness of Oswold; for she already partook somewhat of the dark forebodings which had shrouded my mind, so gloomily, at her Father's villa; and which had not been lessened by an ac- quaintance with the family of Lord Fitz- henry. That he was artful and intrigueing was plainly evident, and to unite his name and fortune with that of Oswold was the first wish of his heart we could see beyond the shadowof a doubt. But he could never compel Franuolina to a union with any of his family, we well knew, for too well was she secured for his avaricious designs. But if he should gain the information that she was my legal bride, he might do much to thwart the future happiness of each. I remained several weeks at the estate of Fitzhenry before I could summon cour- ageto leave Fransolina in the care of his artful family . But she urged the necessi- ty of my speedy departure to which I re- luctantly complied.         ^ Before, bidding her adieu, I presented her with a chain to which was attached a miniature likeness of myself; and as I twined it around her snowy neck, I said laughingly, "My dear,I hope this may not prove as fatal to your haplpiness as my mother's diamond necklace has to mine." "Never fear that," she cheerfully re- plied, "for I shall be more coy of dis-     playing it to the eyes of the curious than you were, in' the 'days of 'your, Childi anity." , '  We pledged ourselves *to correspond ften and faitlifully witchah'other, of all which might occur inoutr separation; and after m ngling. together our tears, of e- gret- and our prayers for the welfar and safety of each, we separated, with the fonid hope of meeting againn 'h our bridal anniversary, to part no nmre until calld by death to our final depose  Afier leaving the estate Of Fitsheriry,; direfted rmy couire ;for Siotland.

While I w   as;indtilging in the joyful   emotions of my fortunate adventure,t Maurice, my servant, arrived, with a small t package, which I eagerly grasped, as if it s were the crowning joy to my earthly felic t ity.  "And where did you get this,Maurice?"  I enquired, not seeing the usual post-mark upon it.  "A gentleman gave it me, sir." "Ha! A gentleman, say you?"  "I did sir; he enquired if I were not the servant of Fredric Harclay, Esq., and  when I answered him in the affirmative,  he told me to deliver this to you; with the request that you would 'honor him with an interview this evening, at the ves- sel, which lays at her moorings near by; in which he is a passenger." "Who can it be?"  I enquired, as I looked at the superscription, but thatKwas in a strange hand. I turned to the mas- . sive seal, it was ominous of ill. , With a trembling hand I broke it; but when I had hastily glanced over a few, lines, a faintness came over me, and all seemed shrouded in the darkness and gloom of night. Maurice bathed my temples with the cool water from' my father's fountain, which sent forth its dancing spray so joy- ously above me, and I revived. Ah, yes; but it was only to the anguish of despair. "God of'Heaven." I ejaculated, " dead, dead; my Fransolina, my bride, my angel of beauty and grace. Idol of my heart, life of my soul; can it be thou art no more. Oh!- why, why did I survive you? .Why did I leave thee, in pursuit of vain glories, of empty honors and perish. ing wealth? Would to God it had not been the. command-of thy noble parent.'1 "Had we not better repair to the vessel sir?" asked Maurice, who stood pale and trembling before 'me.     . "The night is closing around us; shall we -not go immediately, sir?" "Yes, yes," I answered, "lead the way; I would know the worst. Oh  - why have I lived to feel the poignant pangs which rend assunder the life chords of my bleeding and desolate heart. Frausolina, why did I survive you, only to know the utter hopelessness of despair and desolation." When we arrived at the vessel, I was met by a man, who grasped my hand with cordial warmth. "Friend Harclay," he said, "I fear that letter has been. the messenger of sad 2   tidings to you; but we must learn to bow to the rod that, smites us, my friend. I sympathize with you truly; it is an afflic- tive dispensation to us all, and may God help us to bear it with Christian resiona- tion!" "Fitzhenry," I said, as soon as I could command myself. For it was him that stood before me. "Tell me, tell me all; I could not read the letter you forwarded." " But you look worn and haggard, my friend;" he answered in a kindly tone; "repair with me to the cabin, where I will order a cordial to revive your sinking nature, you need refreshment and repose. C6me with me to the cabin, and I will tell you all." He took my hand, and led me passively as a weary child. I threw myself upon a luxurient couch; for my trembling limbs seemed scarcely able to support me'; and Fitzhenry seated himself by my side; seemingly agitated with grief, while he vainly endeavored to offer to me words of condolence and sympathy. He said, "that Fransolina had died in accouchment; her illness was short,' he continued, "and she had left no pledges of love, or tokens of friendship to any one; nor even di. vulged the name of her husband, as her lamented father did not give her pertnis. sion to do so until the time specified by him should arrive." "But," he added, we were suspic- ious that you were the one; from the fact that a miniature likeness of yourself was found to have been in her possession, and as there were none other, excepting those of her parents, we felt secure in addressing you, as such, with the informa- tion of her death. Were we right, sir, in our conjectures; were you not her law- ful companion, with the consent and sanc- tion of the lamented, baron?" "I was, I was, Fitzhenry, the happiest of husbands, with an angel for a bride. "Oh I death, how couldst thou thrust thy withering dart at the fairest of earth's tflowers; the cherished idol of my heart? Would to God I had died for thee, Fran-  solina, angel of purity, and---." "Compose yoursif, my dear sir," said Fitzhenry, as he held a goblet to my lips. "Take this cordial, it will revive you." h  But more dead than alive, I could not command strength, either to refuse, or r receive the cordial, which he strenuously d forced into my mouth, saying, "you     must remain  my guest for the ni friend Harclay., You need repose, 'nigt thyself to, its gentle influence.?

Soon, thp storm. burst upon, us, with fearful 'and terrific fuiry; the thunders roared in awful peals, above and around us; the giant wave came hissing and foam. ing; with maddened rage, against the quiv- ering timbers of the plubging ship, which seemed jlike, a! tiny feather in the whirl- winds's,furious. grasp.,  Avivid flash of lightning lit up :the sur- rounding gloom, and disclosed to my view a rocky island, not far in the 'distance, upon which the vessel was rushing with maddened and fearful velocity. 'The next moment a crash, mingled with the wild, terrific yell of the despairing seamen, com-. pleted 'the fearful scene    , When consciousness again returned to me, I was laying, bruised and shivering, upon the rpcky shore. ,The sthrm had passed ;'but th'e,.'waves ,veie Still dashingg and foagnmirg witIl restless violence agSinst the cra'gs and reefs cf the rock-bound shore; .

For many -hours I sat uipon the cold hard beach, recalling the mysterious, events of:.my life, so replete with sorrow and suffering.   At length 'the morning sunbeams gilded like burnished gold the floating spray far oit upon the wild restless deep. I strained my eyes anxiously 'for the vessel and crew that had conveyed me hither; the vessel lay a perfect wreck up- on!a reef of rocks'not many yards from where I had found safety from the storm; and many of that hapless crew were lay- ing, mangled and distorted, upon the iocky shore,: cold and silent, in the sleep of death. It was hot long before many of the islanders came to the scene of devastation; for it was upon'this island that 1 had been cast; and soon. we laid them to rest' be- neath the silent turf, in this sacred reposi. tory of the dead. All the money and valuables, taken from the vessel's wreck, they cordially and kindly' accorded to me;' as I had signified my intention of remaining upon the island, where the winds and tie, waves had driven me. Here I lived, alone and in badness, mourning over the untimely death of' my heart's idol, anrd regrettiig the fates that had snatched me from my father's lordly halls, when happiness seemed already wreathing my brow with her dazzling cor- 'onet, as a reward for my assiduous and persevering 'efforts of the past. But I had nodesire; again to renew my travels; 'for my parents, if living, had long since ceased to weep for -their darling boy, and for titled wealth and lordly honors 4 had neither ambition or desire, since 'the pride of my heart and soul no longer re- mained to share them with me. One eve- ning, about two years from my 'last ad- veture, I was standing 'moodily' by the shore, upon the very spot Where I had been :cast from the vessel's wreck., leaning pensively against a brokbn crag, watching the anry clouds that loomed up porten. 'tipoutly from their oceanibed, when I ob- served far out to sea, the' white sails of ta noblAe'hi staeering' directly for the friendly. F'harbor of our qutet' bay. t I 'involuntarily sent up:a prayer for its.  sffety, 'as the :cluds swept fiercer and darker over the' anirywave, shutting out from myi view thi;'gllant' ship which sped so nobly Over the swelling tide. Thy lighining flashed vividly, and the heavy peals of thunder, mingling with the wild, unearthly screams of the frightened sea-birds, sent a thrill of fparful horror through every iibre' of my heart. For they brought to my recollection the fearful     scene in which I had participated, and from which I had so providentially escaped. I remembered the dangerous reef of rocks upon which many a gallant ship had been shattered. I hastened to my cabin, which was not many yards in the distance, and procured a torch, which I raised high above me, to warn them of their danger. It availed them but little, for soon heard the despairing cry of voices in that direction, rising fearfully above the howl ing of the blast. The storm passed quickly and hurriedly away; and I heard the plashing of oars and the voices of seamen, from the oppo site shore, and I knew that brave hearts' and dauntless arms were hastening to the rescue. I was turning with a joyful and thankful heart, to seek the solitude of my onel home, when a light substance floating upon the wave, and borne steadily on. ward by the flowing tide, attracted my at. tenton. I hastily reached forth my hand to grasp it from a heavy wave; and to i my surprise, found it to be the body of  child, drenched and chilled by the cold spray, and apparently lifeless. I bore it tenderly to the light and warmth  of my humble home, and procured every p available means to restore it to life. a I had nearly abandoned my long and P fruitless endeavors, when her tiny lips parted with a smile, and her eyes, of azure hue, looked out from beneath the heavy - lids, like a ray of soft sunlight, to my des. olate heart. I again renewed my exertions with  greater avidity, and was soon rewarded wi for my labor, in the complete restoration re of life and activity.        -Po She looked timidly and fearfully upon  me, as if she would flee my presence, for in the long beard and rough exterior of a lone hermit, was repulsive to a child Who ery had never seen ought but wealth and the beauty. But I pacified her as best I could, I giving her cortials to warm and refresh and her, and wrapping her in warm garments, u I soon lulied her into a sweet and quiet re. pose. I laid her gently upaon the best couch which my hermitage afforded. thanking the Father of mercies, from the I fuluess of my overflowing heart, that He he had placed me here for some good pur- I pose, by relieving the sufferings of the destitute and homeless. I busied myself for a long while, in safe   and separating her rich garments, and placing )ed. them to dry around my glowing fire, when of a glittering chain, which had become en- had tangled in some of the rich embroidery, attracted my curiosity. not' I immediately applied myself to the d a task of extricating it, hoping that it might to impart to me some information respecting the parentage of the rescued child. As I I disengaged it, I found that a locket was at hat tached to it; and on placing it in the light li- for closer examination, to my indescribable surprise, I beheld my own likeness, which ly I had presented to my bride on the morn. rs, ing of our separation. o. For a few moments, I seemed transfixed ;rs to the spot where I was standing, while every fibre of my heart seemed completely paralyzed. I knewnot how to'solve the UI mystery, Unless that heartless villain Fitz. Y henry, hadplayed me false., ig  He had done so in my capture, and in - spiriting me away from the scenes of my d bridal joys. Why should he have followed my footsteps, and exiled me from the land o if Fransolina was no longer an inhabitant a of earth        r a i Many circumstances suggested them- selves to my memory, to confirm my sus. picions, and the thought that she had lived and.' had followed me hither, and in all probability had 'found a watery grave, nearly maddened me almost to despera. tion. I, who had stood like a trembling era. ven, secure upon the shore, while she, the idol of my heart, the faithful anl daunt. 'less participator in my exile, had perished within hailing distance, upon the yawning reefs, while I supposed her peacefully re. posing with her noble ancestors. I bent fondly over the innocent cherub, in her unconscious repose. The sweet, angelic expression, and ev- ery feature of her beautiful face, confirmed the truth of my conjectures. It was her child, and mine; yes, mine; and the pure pledge ,of our faithful and mutual vows.  The scalding, tears which fell from my haggard cheek, drenched the pillow upon which she was sweetly reposing. I knelt and prayed as-never before my heart had found utterance. I prayed that the cherished wife and mother might again be restored to the loved onhes of her heart, in peace and safety. I prayed that Heaven would   speedily send relief to my torturing, in- supportable anguish. The bright rays of the morning's dawn was peering cheerfully through my little window, ere I arose from my kneeling posture. I looked through the little case- ment, upon the broad ocean,' which lay calm, peaceful and smiling, in the sun- light, as though no treachery had ever lurked beneath its placid wave. The wreckers were already at their task; grasping greedily whatever might float from the unfortunate wreck. I saw them drag the body of a female from the shore, and were already divest- ing it of its rich attire. Maddened to desperation, I flew with a menacing air to the scene of sacriligious outrage. I clasped the body frantically to my embrace. The face which had once been surpas. singly beautiful, was fearfully mangled and distorted. But the soft, wavy hair, the rich attire, I had seen them before de- corating the beautiful form and features of my loved and cherished Fransolina. The wreckers weie fleeing from me in dismay; for they believed me, as well they might, frantic with insanity. But I besought them to assist me in conveying the lifeless form to my humble copt.; and to procure for me a shroud that I might decently bury my dead. Language is too faint to portray my emotions, as I bent fondly and despairing- ly over that once beautiful form, cherished ever in the holiest sanctuary of my now desolate heart. I laid her, with the kind assistance of the Islanders, quietly to rest, beneath the cold turf, and have daily bedewed it with the tears of unfeigned and heart-felt sor- row. They marvelled at the deep grief which seemed to break up the bitter foun- tains of my innermost soul. But I never told them that she was aught to me, more than a friend of other days. My child was now the only object of my care and solicitude. I bent my whole, even all of my energies to the pleasing task of rearing her for the high station to which her birth entitled her. And- nobly has she repaid my efforts; for now, at. the age of ten years, she is far advanced in her studies; and a few days since, I took her to a neighboring city, for the purpose of placing her under the care of one of the best teachers the country can boast.    The principal teacher was absent; en- joying a short vacation from the tedious. ness of the school room; but her assistant assured me that my little Fransolina, would receive the strictest attentions that kindness and affection could bestow, from the principal lady, whom they all loved and revered. Again I returned to the solicitude of my dreary home; I missed the cheering smile that sent a thrill of pleasure to my stricken heart, and the light silvery laugh that vibrated gladsomely through the isolated walls of my humble dwelling. I missed the affectionate embrace, and the sweet kiss, as she bade good night ere she retired to her happy slumbers. The loneliness of my home was insup- portable; and I spent my leisure in trav- ersing tire beach for diversion and forget- fulness. CHAPTER IX. "And I have marvelled deeply, how A thing in human form can have The power and will to work such wo, And journey calmly to the grave." Yesterday, as I was taking my cust6m- ary walk, I espied, not far in the distance, two gentlemen walking leisurely towards me, deeply engaged in conversation. Just then, I stooped to pick up some curious looking shells which had floated to the beach; and while I was thus en- gaged they passed me, and seated them- selves only a few yards in the distance. They continued their conversation with- out seeming to notice, me; and I still busied myself in my childish occupation. Soon, to my surprise, I heard my own name pronounced in connexion with that of Fransblina, heiress of Oswold. I cast a stealthy look at them, without seeming to do so, and to my inexpressible surprise and consternation, beheld thee villain Fitzhenry, and my servant Maurice, or rather, the son and counterpart of my hated betrayer. A sudden faintness'camce over me, and I should have fallen had not pride and curiosity prevailed to sustain me. But they appeared not to notice me; and continued their conversation undis. turbed. "c I think," said the elder, " that it must be somewhere in this vicinity that Sir     William Seymour met your cousin so unexpectedly a year since." "But," said the younger, " he might have been--- ." "No, he said he was sure of her iden- tity. He said that he followed, her through several streets; but somehow,she mysteri- ously eluded him; and for several days, after he searched with vigilence; but could find no clue to her retreat. We will commence the search in a few days, and if fortune favors our efforts, I think she will readily accede to our proposals." "We have nothing more to fear from that plebian Barclay, for the few that escaped that terrible storm and shipwreck asserted that they saw him sinking be- neath a yawning wave; and we are safe enough from his interference. "And that brat, too, of a plebian father: how singular, that she too, should find a watery grave; leaving our road to fortune and affluence unrestricted. "And now, if -Fransolina, of Oswold, t does not consent to an honorable alliance V with the House of Fitzhenry, she will feel its vengeance more fearfully than she has heretofore. "I will crush her as a thing not worthy t of existence. I will spurn her as a thing s of nought into oblivion. I will --" d "But stop, my father; you must recol- c lect that we have not yet discovered her w retreat." "But I will discover it," he answered with vehemence, "'and if she is an in- t habitant of earth, she shall feel my power to and vengence too - if- -.' I could bear no more; my soul, was s burning with the fire and energy of other days. I raised myself erect; though sv trembling in every limb like a quivering m aspen. Like a chafed tiger, I was ready y, to spring with a deadly bound upon my it hated prey. I felt at the moment, that I could annihilate them from my presence; gr and crush them with scornful indignation th beneath the dust they had polluted. ar But a sudden thought restrained me. Fransolina might yet be restored to me; fis and I could never pollute her presence sa with my hands reeking with the blood of ret her kinsmen. No,- they might pass on, unmolested, to bide the justice of a higher tribunal. liv I passed unnoticed to my hermitage, and her there gave vent to the various emptions of his my heart in prayers of thankfulness and s tears of joy.   so' Again I am going forth to mingle with the world,.

[  I saw' him drop a tear over the humble grave, and its unconscious sleeper ; as though his love and devotion still lingered' amidst those sacred shades. I returned to the Inn, and met the little fishing party, which. had just returned in safety, and were anxiously awaiting my return; for it was 'long past the hour of noon.   .  "She has seen the Hermit," said our lively friend B --, , the animation of her countenance betrays her; and learned his history too," he continued, as his eyes 'sted enquiringly upon the scroll I held in my hand.   "Indeed I have," I answered, as I held the manuscript up to his view, " but for the present it is se'led to the eye of curi- osity." CHAPTER X. "Thou beautiful . thou. beautiful-! my thoughts again on thee  Are wandering, and sweet visions of thy loveliness I see : A fairy dream of hope is here to cheer me with its joy, s Oh! when I wake it must not this illusion all des- troy."  Several years passed away; but they brought to my ear no tidings of the Island Recluse. And he was remembered only with a sigh, for his past misfortunes; and a desire to know the result of his last ad-. venture.  One day as Ii was walking leisurely through the crowded thoroughfares of our own populous city; leading by the hand my little boy, of scarce two summers, who was roguishly pointing, to the many glittering toys and showy fabrics which filled, so gaudily, the large windows where we passed; and which my own mind compared most ungraciously to Bunyan's Vanity Fair, in his Pilgrim's Progress, till I had lost myself in following the various directions which the pilgrims of a later day have sought out, by many cunning inventions, not so dreary or laborious to pursue as those which -he so ably describ- ed; and where many of them could turn aside, at their plasure, to mingle in the scenes of Vanity Fair; without seemingly retarding the progress of their pilgrimage, notwithstanding the additional weight they have received from those scenes of vanity. I was moralizing a little, when a clear, silvery shout of admiration from my little boy, caused me to turn my eyes in the direction which he pointed. We were just passing the --  House, where a carriage :was drawn up, and a tall, handsome and elegantly formed gentle. man, was alighting with a lady of syme- trical form and face dazzlingly beautiful; and a young girl of scarce sixteen sum- mers, with an eye like the 'ies' deep azure, and a cheek which VRed with the vermillion's hue,1 and with flowing tresses I'f   which fell, like waves of sunlight, over a neck and brow of transparent beauty. They were clad in the richest attire; and through many a voluptuous fold of lace and satin sparkled the dazzling light of pearls and diamonds of rare and costly beauty, and which had called forth that shout of -admiration from my little boy. As we were passing, the gentleman fixed his dark, piercing eyes enquiringly upon me, and, I thought,'all too rudely; which caused my cheek to burn with in- dignation, and my eye to sparkle with a brilliancy more repulsive than the lustrous glow of the diamond settings which adorn- ed the beauty of his lovely companions. He advanced a step, with an air and look of assurance which it seemed would have better graced a brainless coxcomb, than a gentleman and companion of such peerless matchless beings who seemed to claim his attention and protection. "Do you remember the Recluse of Glenisle?" he whispered, in a low tone, as he bent gracefully and respectfully for- ward; with a merry twinkling in his dark, piercing eye, which, a moment before, I had supposed looked with such impudent familiarity upon me. But my resentment vanished speedily, on hearing the name pronounced in which I had taken such a lively interest. "Indeed I do sir," I answered quickly, "do you know aught of him? Have the loved and the lost been restored to his-" I hesitated; it was a stranger with whom I was speaking. Already I might have betrayed the sacred trust which the Her- mit had reposed in me. For I knew not, but the graceful stran- ger before me might be the hated foe and pursuer of the unfortunate Harclay. He quickly perceived my embarrass- ment, and with a smile continued. ' "We stop here, only for the night: if you would learn more of the Recluse, call here this evening, at my room, No. .- , and you shall receive the desired infor- mation." I readily assented, for the interest I had, taken in the history of the unfortunate re- cluse surmounted every barrier. Hle bow- ed gracefully as he gave me his card of address, and then hastened to conduct the ladies to their own apartments. A thousand emotions agitated my mind during the remainder of the day; but my curiosity to learn more of the hermit's his- tory predominated, and as the clock an-     nounced the hour of seven, I hastened un- hesitatingly to the --  house, which was not far from my own residence, and the host being a gentleman of unimpeachable honor I had no fears whatever. I ascended lightly the richly carpeted stairs and rapped gently at the door, No. , which stood slightly ajar, through which I could perceive the splendidly at' tired ladies, and the gentleman who had so unceremoniously accosted me a few hours before, deeply engaged in conversa- tion. I was, however, ushered in by the gentleman who very politely gave me an introduction to the ladies, at the same time requesting us to excuse him for a few mo- ments. The ladies were in fine spirits, entertain- ing me with some lively sketches iof their travels, in his absence, when the door slowly opened and to my great surprise the veritable hermit himself made his ap. pearance. I arose quickly from my seat with an exclamation of joy, and cordially extended my hand to meet his trembling grasp. He looked the same as when we met and parted in'the Island grave-yard; the same haggard and wo-begone visage; the same stooping trembling form; the same dark and painfully pierceing eye all un- changed. "And this, sir," I said, as I grasped warmly his trembling hand, " is a pleasure, as great as it was unexpected. How fares it with thee my friend of Glenisle?" But before I had uttered the last syllable the hermit's garb lay quietly at my feet- the cowl, the long white locks and beard - which had given to his whole face such a venerable appearance, and before me stood calm and erect the gentleman by whom I had been invited with the same graceful and youthful form and the same merry twinkle in his dark lustrous eye. For a moment I stood in mute conster i nation perplexed and bewildered. "And what am I to infer from this?" I enquired, as soon as I could find utter- ance.  "  That I am the hermit of Glenisle, the a whilom  son of the gipsey wanderer, the c Frederic Harclay of wild adventures and c fruitless travels. But be seated madam, and I vill com- mence the thread of my narrative where E it was so unsatisfactorily broken off sever- s al years since when I was the lone recluse a of the isle. I was then leaving the hermi-   - tage- to commence my travels in search of s my Fransolina whom I had twice mourned e and lamented as dead. e  My first course was to visit the school, or rather Ihe teacher, under whose especial. d care I wished to place my idol daughter in  my uncertain absence. It was late when h I arrived in the city, but impatient of de- - lay I hastened immediately to the resi- i dence of Mrs. Elston, the principal teach- v er under whose protection I wished to , leave my little Fransolina, and desired of e the maid in attendance an interview with her mistress, which she frankly denied me, eafter having satisfied her curiosity by rude. - ly surveying my whole appearance, telling me that her mistress had, only a few hours -before, returned from the country, and r was too greatly fatigued to see company r at that hour. She told me, however, that she would procure me an interview in the morning; t and with a feeling of disappointment and ' chagrin, I returned in search of lodgings , for the night. My old companions, the fates, already seemed on the alert, and I t now feared their frowns and caprices as much as in former days I had sought their smiles and favors; but they had often play- ed me false, and left me the disappointed victim of their wild coquetish freaks. At that moment I almost dreaded again to come in contact with the cold unsympa- thizing, world. Had I known that my heart's idol was peacefully at rest with her noble ances- tors, that she was free from the dark de. signing villiany of her ungrateful kinsmen, I would have gladly sought before I slept the gloomy though friendly shelter of my Island home, and buried myself from the cold gaze of men in its retired seclusion. However, I at last procured a shelter and lodgings for the night, and after hav. ing committed myself to divine care, I fell into a calm, dreamy repose, from which I did not awake until the morning. As soon as propriety and etiquet would permit, I hastened again to the teacher's residence. My mind was more than usu- ally depressed, for it was torture to think of leaving my little daughter in the care of strangers, for a pursuit which promised me so little reward. I was permitted an interview, but my heart, more than once, misgave me for the sacrifice I was about to make for a vision- ary uncertainty. As I was passing through the hall, I   heard the clear silvery tones of my little f Fransolina in an adjoining apartment, and 1 as I entered with an exclamation of joy, she flew into my'armns, saying, as she did t so, " this, kind lady, is my father, my t dear, dear father." I followed with my! eyes the direction which she eagerly point- ( *ed, and caught a glimps of'a face and form which seemed ito parallize every. pul- sation and emotion of my heart and soul. A thick heavy mist gathered around my vision, the scene before me vanished like the meteor's dazzling light, and all seemed shrouded in the silence 'and darkness. of death. When I awoke to consciousness a rich musical voice was whispering in my  ear which seemed like the low soft tones of angel voices. A soft hand wasehlafing my throbbing'temples, while she whisper- ed in my ear of faithful!love and a joyful future. - She lives,-your Fransolina lives," again sounded, halt dreamily in my ears, "and faithful still my Frederic. Heaven be praised that thou art again restored to me as a reward for my long and hopeless love and devotion." We will pass 'briefly over the joyful scene of our unexpected meeting - for words are inadequate to the description- and give you a short sketch of Franso- lina's history. \ Soon after my departure from the es- tate of Fitzhenry, his oldest son returned from his travels, a fearful wreck in wealth, and all the nobler qualifications of princi. ple and honor, but a finished libertine, a heartless, dissipated, self-conceited man of the world. He! had not formed an al-- liance in his absence, as his father had an- ticipated, with the[ affluent nobility; and to make amends for his disappointment, Fitzhenry resolved) to secure to him the title and estate of his deceased relative, the baron of Oswold. For several weeks and months after my departure, Franso. lina received the most affectionate atten- tions from them; for well they knew how to conceal their artifices. His profligate son, after having, as he supposed, captivated the heart of Franso.: lina, was sent to watch my proceedings, and to give an account of them to his father, who was artfully acting his part of villainy at home. I recollect, after having arrived in Scotland, of hinting to my ser- vant Maurice, myl intention of returning shortly to Italy, which I suppose he faith-   fully communicated to his father, warning him of the dangers of delay. It was about that time that the persecu- tions of my Fransolina commenced. He told her that I had deserted her, that I had fled with another, to my American home, (for indeed he did not intend that I should ever return,) and many other things, as false as the heart that conceived them. But all this availed him nothing, for Fran. solina's heart trusted to the truthfulness of my own love and fidelity. At last he grew desperate, and men- aced her with threats, until she dared no longer to retmain under his roof. With the assistance of her faithful maid, she stealthily sought the friendly retreat of a neighboring convent, where she could re- main unharmed and secure from farther persecutions, until my return. At this, Fitzhenry was maddened to desperation. He-vowed to revenge him- self fearfully upon me; and the success of his villainy, I have given an account in a former chapter. Fransolina remained in the quietude of the cloister's retreat, slowly recovering her health, after having given birth to a beautiful daughter, daily wishing and anticipating my return ;' yet fearing that I might be the victim of his villanous revenge. CHAPTER XI. " Where thou diest will I die, and there will I be buried. The Lord do sa to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and me." Months passed away, yet no tidings came to cheer her, from her absent hus- band. Still, she would never yield to. de- spair, but continued to hope against hope. One day, a little more than a year from the time of the events which I have just described, a pale, haggard, wo-begone wreck of humanity, sought an interview withFransolina at the convent. She had taken no voivs, and was at lib- erty to receive and converse with any one, if she chose, although until this time, she had kept herself in the strictest seclusion. He was admitted as one that bore tidings from her absent husband. e He confessed that he was bribed by 'Fitzhenrv, with the promise of a rich re- ward, to convey me to my native shores, or to dispose of me in some other way, so that I might never again intercept his path     and interest. He accepted the proposals of Fitzhenry to spirit me away, although he said he never intended to. do me the harm which his master had hinted. He described to her the voyage, the storm at sea, the fearful wreck, and loss of many of his comrades. He told her that he: saw me, when the lightnings flashed vividly over the foaming waters,borne rapidly along by a mountain ous billow, and cast upon the rocky shore of a lonely isle.  He gave her an account of Fitzhenry's villainy,in fabricating the story of her death and enticing me to the vessel, under pre. terce of giving me farther. particulars his villany in forcing me to take the, opiate he had previously prepared, and then de- serting me in the hour of my deep afflic. tion, and leaving me to the mercy of the - winds and the waves. He described to Fransolina, the locality where we had been wrecked, as acceu t rately as possible, telling her if I were yet I alive, he was sure I would Oever again s visit their shores, believing as I did, that t she was peacefully resting with her kin- dred in the sweet repose of death.  h "But," he added, "  I scorn and refuse the reward of the heartless Fitzhenry, and I would even sacrifice my life in your ser. h vice, if that would atone for the guilt of h my past life. If you wish to escape from h farther persecutions, to seek your husband. s across the treacherous deep,and will trust di yourself to my protection, I pledge myself f to serve you faithfully, with the last pul. h sation of my penitent life." To resolve, with Fransolina, was to ex. ecute; there was yet a hope that I lived; W indeed, the gushing truthfulness of her r heart told her as much; and with all the i devotion of faithful love, she made imme- r diate preparations for her departure. Her d faithful maid voluntarily offered to accom . pany her, which offer was joyfully re-  ceived. Nothing of consequence occurred to in- ha terrupt or retard their passage, until they; ki had  nearly gained our friendly shore, when they were overtaken by the storm I  wa have previously described, where I so pro- the identially rescued my little Fransolina from city a watery grave, who, with the faithfule maid, had been precipitated from the ves. the sel by a mountainous wave which swept curi violently over it. The maid sank cold sho and lifeless, beneath the ocean's foam,    sals while a' friendly wave bore my helpless ugh child to the arms of a desolate father. the  It was the cold, lifeless form of the faithful maid, whom I laid with suich re the ligious devotion, beneath the quiet shades loss of Gtletle.. Peace to her ashes for she was faithful to the last.' the Many others perished, and among them, ing he who had so faithfully executed the trust in. reposed in him by my own Fransolina. Ore She was now alone, a stranger in a strange land, with no friend to appeal to for pro- tection and assistance; for nearly all of her gold and jewels had been washed away, with many other valuable articles, so that on" reaching a place of safety, she found that she had scarcely enduigh left for subsistance' until she could .compose her mind for farther efforts. But Heaven he provided for her in a strange land, kindly friends and benevolent hearts, in this her hour of need and sorrow. Again she u threw off the weight of sorrow which et pressed so heavily upon her young and in sensitive mind, and aroused herself to ac. t tion.. She, who had ever reposed in the as lap of luxury, nowisought with her own hands, to raise herself from the- depen- dence of strangers; for she had no desire d to return to:the land of her birth, until she d had found .him whom her soul loved, that f we might together enjoy the wealth which nher lamented father bequeathed to us; for a: she fully believed that the day was, not' far i distant when we should be restored, all faithfully, to each other's-embrac. Our little daughter, she had not the least doubt, was quietly sleeping beneath the ocean wave. She soon offered herself as gov. erness to the children of a wealthy family, ; who kindly procured her the'situation of *principal teacherin a respectable and flour. ishing school for young- ladies-which trust she had ever filled. with becoming dignity and honor. Every vacation she took excursions into the neighboring, and sometimes in the distant towns, with the fond, hope of meeting her husband, who had been'so cruelly deceived by her artful kinsman, Fitzhenry. You will recollect that it was while she was taking one of those excursions; (and the last) that I took my daughter to the city, for the purpose of placing. her under the instructions of Mrs. Elston, for that is the name she assumed for her greater se- curity, immediately after her arrival to our shores. On her return the following morning,   she was informed by her assistant, that a little girl, had been left to her care, by a astrange looking man, who was rather de- sirous of seeing Mrs. Elston, the principal teacher, of whom report spoke so favor- ably; 'that he' might place his daughter under her especial protection. Mrs. Elston desired to have the little stranger admitted immediately to her pre- sence. As she entered, the first glance of her rare and' dazzling -beauty, and noble dig- nity, prepossessed her affections immedi. :ately in her favor. ' "And what is your name, my little maiden?" she enquired; as she drew her caressingly to her fond embrace. "Fransolina Oswold "Harelay," was, answered, in a soft, silvery voice, which seemed to vibrate through the deepest re- cesses of her throbbing heart,almost para-- lized with emotionsbof overflowing joy. "-What is: the matter, my dear, dear ady?  Are you ill? shall I not call, assistance?" enquired the little girl, as she beheld. her cheek fearfully pale; and her eyes fixed with a wild,glassy stare upon her. That voice aroused her. "No, my dear," she answered, as she recovered a little from her sudden faintness. ' I, who . have borne firmly and alone the heaviest weights of sorrow and deso- lation, need not the 'assistance of an or- dinary attendant when my heart is burst- ing from the' fulness of its overflowing joy. "But come to my arms; and tell ,me all about your home, the name' of your father, and how it happened he placed you hear under my instructions." "My home; the home I mean, where my father lives," answered the little girl, with artless simplicity, ," is not so grand as this; neither is it ornamented with so many fine and beautiful things as this; but oh! I wish you could see how beauti- ful it- looks in a summer's morning, all covered with the white, foamy spray, which the fairy zephyrs have placed there during the night, sparkling like the glitter- ing coral in the broad sunbeafms that sweep so brilliantly over the bosom of the deep, blue sea. My father, his name is - O, I can- not tell what is his name. I have heard people sometimes call him the old Hermit; but I was always so indignant that I would run away before I heard any thing more.     " . .     "And he does look old; because he always wears a-something on his head which droops down so,--over his face, as if it was. trying to conceal his long, white hair, which hangs so loosly all over his chin and neck; but I am sure he is not old either. "I will tell you what I did see once, it was when' a terrible storm swept over the ocean, and cries of distress were plainly heard in our cottage, from a vessel's crew. My father was rushing out of the door to render them all the assistance he could; "when a sudden gust of Wind blew off the --something from  his head, and the long, white hair fell too; and his forehead looked so white and fair with glossy black hair lying in thick, rich, curling masses over his smooth temples. "Oh! he did look so young and hand- some--just like this ;" she continued, as she drew. slowly from her bosom, 'a rich minature case, to which was attached a gold chain of exquisite workmanship. "But you will no6t tell my father; for in- deed. he has never shown 'it to me. I found it, carefully laid away,'in the cor- ner of a box; and it looked so much as he did, on the .day of the fearful storm; and I love it so --, see I! is it not beau. tiful?" She asked; as she held it up to her view. "Fredric, my own, my cherished and long-lost husband. Father in heaven, I thank thee, for these manifestations of thy preserving care and merciful love. My treasures are again restored to me; my cup of joy and thankfulness is filled to overflowing. And you, my little Fran- solin a, are my own idolized and long-lost daughter. Heaven be praised, for the preservation of thy life, and for thy re- storation to a mother's fond embrace; and naught but death shall part us more." It was at this interesting period that I arrived; with a mind so sadly depressed, and was ushered into her presence. When I had recovered from the swoon into which I had fallen on beholding so un- expectedly, the living, and still beautiful form and features of my heart's idol, I found 'that all the false fixtures, with -which I had so successfully, deceived the eyes of curiosity, had been most ungrace- fully torn from their unbecoming positions, and I stood before them the Fredric Har- clay of other days; the happy husband and father, of a faithful and devoted wife ,and an affectionate and loving daughter.     We were not long in making preparations to return to Europe, where, after our ar- rival, which was heralded with joy by our former friends and acquaintance, we took immediate possession of the old Baronial estate, and publicly celebrated our nup tials, with all the pomp and display befit. ting our rank and station; and in accor. dance with the last wish and injunction of our father, the Baron. As we were about starting on our bridal tour, I proposed to my lady the idea of taking Scotland in our way, and of visit: ing the old, deserted castle, from which I had twice before been so artfully spirited away, to which she readily acquiesced, laughingly adding, "That I might now' dispel all my fears as to further intrigues; for our past, though painful experience had been to us a faith ful instructor, and one lesson surely we should never forget. That is, never to  trust too credulously to the syren voice of vaunting friendship, which has so often thrown her glittering wand around us, on . ly to dazzle and betray."  CHAPTER XII.        h 'I feel almost at times as I have felt In early childhood."     8 After a long and pleasant journey we  b gained in safety the shores of Scotland and et proceeded immediately to the vicinity of a the ancient castle. We stopped for repose at a neighboring o inn, where I learned with joy that the cas a tle had recently been undergoing exten. w sive repairs, and was already fitted up in ha a most magnificent style for the reception tu of its masters, the earl of Allandorf, who fol had not visited it for many years, and who s had now come up from  his beautiful cas ac tle on the Rhine to celebrate the nuptials of his only daughter. "And," added my host, " if you desire to it, sir, I willj inform the earl of Allandorf ca that there are persons of distinction stop. ping at my house, and I doubt not he will sa cordially receive you as a welcome partic-  ipator in their bridal joys."  I gvae him my card of address, and WC awaited anxiously the result of his mission  He soon returned however, his honest face glowing with the pleasure of succes, and    ions in another hour we found ourselves ap. ar- proaching the castle, up the avenue, be. our neath the shadows of the overhanging ook branches. We were ushered obsequiously nial into a gorgeous saloon, already filled with up- beautiful ladies and titled peers, where we fit- were welcomed and cheered to our heart's or- content. of  After the sports of the day had subsided the company separated in groups, as incli- dal, nation or fancy suggested. A respectable of number, however, remained with the earl, sit- congratulating him on his good fortune, in dh Ipossessing such a noble estate, when a ted friend enquired, ed, "How it happened that he had so long neglected and deserted it?" irs To which the earl replied, gh  "It is a painful story which is so inti- h- mately connected with this venerable cas. we tlo where we enjoyed the first five years of to our wedded felicity. We were young, of full of ardent hopes and bright and joyful en anticipations when we took possession of n- this castle, little expecting that a fearful blight would so soon shroud them all in gloom and darkness, but so it was. About a year after our happy bridal, a son was given us as the fond pledge of our holy and faithful vows. We enshrined him in our hearts as our idol, and worship. ed him as such, forgetful, in our blinded happiness, that our best and holiest love should be given to the great Author and Bestower of the many and unbounded e blessings which we were so-ungratefully enjoying. One day when our son was f about four years of age, the nurse, who had taken:him out into the castle grounds ; for recreation, came running into our apartment with looks which betokened the wildest frenzy of alarm, wringing her hands and weeping bitterly, making ges- tures, for she could not speak, for us to follow her, which we did immediately, yet scarcely knowing  why.' Some terrible accident had happened to our boy we were sure, yet of what nature we could not de- vise. She led us rapidly over the walks to the fountain; on reaching it she ex- claimed with a fearful shudder, "There, there, he has fallen. Oh! save him from a death so fearful." We immediately called assistance and exerted every effort, but to no purpose.- We drained the fountain, but his little life- less form could no where be found." I had sat thus far, through the recital anxiously catching every word that fell a   from his lips, my whole frame trembling like a quivering aspen. Several times I made an effort to speak, but my tongue refused to do its office. At this moment, with a voice scarcely audible, I enquired, "Did your son have upon his neck a diamond chain of great value?" "He did," answered the earl, with an emotion which seemed to rend asunder every fibre of his heart, "I and as our son was no where to be found, we supposed that the nurse, or some other had disposed of him for the purpose of securing the treasure; but the nurse protested her in- nocence in the most solemn manner. Yet notwithstanding her protestations, we dis- missed her from our presence immediately and had her secured in the county jail for further investigation. Are you ill, sir?" enquired the earl, as he saw my pale lips quivering with a vain attempt to utterance. "Father," I said, as with one powerful effort, I threw my nerveless arms around his (neck, " behold in me your son,-the long lost, but never forgotten son of your mutual and faithful vows."  The scene which foll9wed is beyond de. scription. Suffice it to say when at last we did recover to some degree of compo- sure, the ladies were called in, when an. other indescribable scene of joyful surprise ensued, in which my own sweet and af- fectionate mother, my faithful Fransolina, my beautiful and happy sister, were the most conspicuous participators. Congratulations to' each happy party were poured in from every side, from the lordly guests who crowded around us with smiling faces; while tears of joy gushed unrestrained from the fulness of their sen- sative and kindly hearts. A strain of music soft, rich and melodi- ous, swept through the high arched galler- ies and halls of the old castle from a hid- den orchestra, which gave to' the scene a semblance of enchantment; and I even then feared that this was only. some wild freak of my former companions, the fates, which had so often in former ddys led 6n- ly " to bewilder, and'dazzle to blind." The guests kindly departed, one'by one, to seek their own apartments, and left us a happy family so providentially united to enjoy uninterruptedly the bliss of that hap- py meeting, in pouring out to each the joys, the sorrows and heart yearnings of years that had passed. After the guests had all retired, my father, the earl, reaum-   ed his story, which I had so suddenly in- terrupted,-- "After satisfying ourselves that our dear boy had not fallen into the fountain, vigi. lant search was made throughout the old park and the grounds in the vicinity of the castle,' but still unsuccessful. Servants, friends and strangers explored the adjacent towns, and even the whole county, but they could gain no clue to our lost boy, and at' last the search was relinquished as a fruitless one. A dark, gloomy despair seemed to overshadow us, and every thing connected with the castle where we had been the happy recipients of so many blessings. Indeed these noble apartments became insupportable to us; and when all hope had vanished of ever recovering our lost boy, Hpurchased an estate in Germany on the banks of the beautiful Rhine, and re- moved from the scenes which every day recalled more vividly to my mind the loss I had sustained. Before leaving, however, I made another visit to the nurse, who renewed her protestations of innocence, telling me that she had carelessly wander- ed away a few yards for the purpose of gathering a few wild flowers with which to deck her young master's cap, and When she returned he was gone, and as she had left him at the fountain she supposed he must have fallen in. She 'was sure," she said, "that she would have risked her own life to have saved that of her dear little master's, for had. she not nursed him and carried him in her Qwn arms mainy a day, and lulled him to repose upon her own bosom, as though he were her own sweet babe?- and do you think that I would have de- privedmy little angel of his happy life, for the gaudy trinket that glittered around his pearly neck?" Tears choked her utterance, and she wept bitterly. I felt that she was innocent, and I gave her her freedom and prayed to God to forgive me for the wrong I had uninientionally done her. 'SeiVral years passed away, and yet they' brought no tidings of our idol boy. O'e evening my lady was sitting within her' viA'eclad bower, overlooking the beau- tiful Rhine, watching the shadowy rays of the setting sun, as they gilded so daintily , the silver sheen of the placid water, when a quick rustling of the shrubbery aroused iher from a thoughtful revery, and raising  her eyes, she saw before her a wretched,     haggard shadow of humanity, her e-y gleaming wildly from beneath the tangled and disheveled masses of dark hair which fell loosely and carelessly over a face and neck browned by exposure, yet frightfully rigid, as though the pallor of death had already been stamped upon its shadoy outlines. My lady arose quickly from her seat and advanced a few steps in the direction of the castle4 But the phantom (for so she seemed) intercepted her, and grasped her hand with the frenzy of despair "Stay one, only one moment, and hear my guilty confession. I have wandered many a weary mile, for this one moment, to confess my crimes, receive your for. giveness and to die.

It is only a small portion of my pos- sessions, in the which you shall share more bountifully at some future day." When I related to them the events of my own life, they wept as only parents can, for the sufferings of a cherished child. And when I told them of the fond, faith- ful and devotional love of my Fransolina, they strained her to their hearts with tears and caresses, and invoked the blessings of High Heaven to rest upon her, for her pure, holy and devotional love. The scene was truly affecting, for all hearts were gushing alternately with joy and sorrow. Yet notwithstanding, I man- aged for a moment to slip away unnoticed, but soon .returned and introduced myself as the Hermit of Glenisle; for I have ever taken this disguise with re in all my trav- els, as an old and cherished friend, which has served me faithfully through my long, long years of exile and sorrow. Here the scene changed from one of deep interest, to surprise and mirthfulness, in which my beau iful sister took the most conspicuous part, for she alone had suf- fered the least for the heir of Allandorf. She was a wild, mirthful creature, almost etherial in her form, and bearing a striking resemblance to my mother, in the days of my innocent and happy childhood. On every anniversary of our nuptials, we hold a family trist at our beautiful cas- tle in Scotland, where we spend the sum- mer months in joyous sports and excur- sions with our noble and happy guests, while we invariably recall the scenes of the past, with their joys and sorrows; the happy termination of all our wanderings, and our providential restoration to the home   of our childhood and tender embraces of parental affection. The nurse is still living, and has been reinstated as a sort of privileged character, in the old castle, where, on some particu- lar occasions, she assumes airs of great importance over the lower order of do- mestics, telling them " that it was herself that nursed the young master; and if he was stolen away for many a year, he had grown up to be a fine, handsome gentle- man, and she was as proud of him as if he were indeed her own darling son." And Fitzhenry, when he returned and found that we were still living, and had preceded him, and taken possession of the old baronial estate, his chagrin and morti- fication was indescribable. For his own personal safety, however, he and his hopeful son soon after took pas- sage for a distant port, from whence, it is supposed they have continued their trav- els to parts unknown, as they have never since been known to hoist their sails for a homeward-bound trip. The remainder of the family are living in obscurity, mourning over their unwise and unjust ambition, which has so suddenly plunged them from affluence to beggary. Again the history of the past is ended. The dark clouds which formerly closed around us so portentiously, have all disap- peared; bright and smiling prospects only greet us in the future. I have been with these, my faithful wife and cherished daughter, again to visit the hermitage, and the scenes which have been made sacred by our long, long years of sorrow, and our blissful re-union, to part no more, until the stern hand of death sunders the silken cord which binds so closely the love and devotion of our faith- ful hearts. Soon we sail for our native land; but it is not without a tear of regret and a heart- felt invocation for its prosperity, that we bid adieu to the "land of the free and the home of the brave."
