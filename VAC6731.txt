The author of HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS claims for her book nothing suficiently brilliant to pro- voke envious criticism or profound discussion, since it was written in the blind, agonized struggle of a soul seeking refuge from- sorrow, in such effort as, giving the answer of a good conscience, bringeth the peace that passeth all understanding! A. L. S. Chicago, April, 187I.     I   HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. CHAPTER I. THE DEPTHS OF POVERTY. OVERLOOKING a miserable street was a small, scantily-furnished room that could never, under any circumstances, be made to appear cosy or home-like. Just now, however, it was looking its best. The floor was freshly scrubbed, the broken stove blackened, and the bed-clothes tucked neatly under the mattress of the dilapidated bedstead! "Everything looks clean and nice even if it is old and poor," said Janet Soyer, with no little satisfaction, as she sat down on a small, three- legged stool, by the window, and turned to her sister for approval of her work. "There is no use trying to fix up this old     12    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHiS. place," replied Lizzie Soyer, who was five or six years older than Janet, and too indolent to do any- thing that was not absolutely forced upon her. "Don't you think it looks better to be clean than to be dirty a" asked Janet softly. "Oh I suppose so, if there were any one to see it; but there is not; so what is the use of taking so much trouble for nothing?" rejoined Lizzie sharply. "It is not for nothing, Lizzie. Father will be home soon to supper, and he likes to find the room clean and tidy. He says it rests him after a hard day's work to find a nice, quiet spot to call his own." "It isnSt his own after all. It is only a rented room, and a mean, miserable one at that; and I don't see any use of trying to make believe it is better than it is. I hate it; for we didn't always live so; and we needn't now if father had man- aged right. If he hadn't let people cheat him we might have had more." Lizzie Soyer threw her- self back in her chair and looked out of the win- dow in a sulky, discontented way that made her appear very unlovely. ' My Sunday-school teacher used to say," began Janet, "that there are two ways to deal with   THE DEPTHS OF POVERTYr.     13 everything; to make the best of it and to make the worst of it. No matter how bad a thing is we can always make it better or make it worse. I was thinking of that to-day; and so I scrubbed the floor and washed the window and made the bed nicely, and I'm sure that father 'll be pleased when he comes home to-night." "Well, I'm going out, and I shan't be home in time to get supper, so you'll have to get it by yourself," said Lizzie, as she rose and put on her bonnet and shawl. "Oh, Lizzie, do stay and help me; I'm so tired," pleaded Janet, all in vain, as her sister closed the door and left her quite alone. "I don't know as there's any kindling, and the handle is broken off of the hatchet, and how can I make a fire," mused Janet in great perplexity. "If I could find a piece of board," she went on to herself, "I might shave off enough with a case- knife to start a fire. I can't stop to rest now or father will come home before supper is ready." If Janet had been a selfish, ill-tempered little girl, she would have refused to do more than her share of the work, and instead of going cheerfully to do whatever was necessary, she would have spent her time in saying how meanly Lizzie had     "    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. acted and how badly she herself had been treated. She thought, however, more of her father than herself, and she soon forgot how tired she was in planning how she could make him happy. "Nice and strong I'll make the tea," she was saying to herself, "father likes it so, and I'll take the ten cents that Mrs. Flanigan gave me for minding her baby while she went out washing, and Ill buy some nice cooking apples to bake for father; and while the potatoes are cooking I'll set the table and go for a loaf of bread, and stop at the butcher's for a little meat. Meat costs so much we can't afford to get much, and Lizzie and I can do without any. Father works so hard that he needs more to eat than we do, though he never likes to take all of anything, but wants me to have some, too. I think father loves me more than he does Lizzie; I don't know as I want him to, yet sometimes I think that I love him a great deal more than Lizzie does. She never seems to care whether he has anything nice or not. She cares only for herself. There, I am afraid that is 'judging,' and my Sunday-school teacher says that we have no right to judge,--no right to think ourselves good and others bad. I don't know Lizzie's heart; I can not see into it, and so   THE DEPTHS OF POVERTY.      15 I have no right to say that she doesn't care for any one but herself. Maybe she does care, only does not say all that she feels-" Janet was very busy after this for some little time, too busy to put her thoughts'in words, but they were about the same thing over -what she would get for her father's supper, and what he would think when he came home and found every- thing so neat. A busy, planning, thoughtful little girl was Janet Soyer, just entering her thirteenth year, yet wearing in her face the look of one much older. She was not tall of her age, and she had a lithe, slender form that added to her child-like appear- ance. She had an abundance of dark brown hair, a low, smooth, broad forehead, a small nose and mouth, an oval-shaped face, blue eyes, and a clear white complexion just tinted with rose-color. I do not think she ever thought of herself as being beautiful, yet she liked to have her hair evenly parted and smoothly combed, her face and hands clean, and her dress neat and whole. She was a child whose face had a story to tell, - a story that you could not read all at once,- but one that would come to you by degrees as you watched the far-off wistfulness of her eyes and a     16    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS.  certain sad quiver that now and then played hide and seek about her mouth. It was her sad little mouth that seemed always to remember the weariness of To-Day, while her eyes, eager and wistful, strained their gaze to the morning land of a brighter To-Morrow. Cold and hunger and weariness might come to this child, yet she would not believe that they were to stay with her forever and always. She would be sure that food and warmth and rest were coming if she could only wait. And yet it is harder sometimes to wait than to work. Janet found it so on this particular even- ing; for after supper was ready, the lamp trimmed and lighted, and her father still away, she found it very hard to sit and wait for him to come. While she had been busy the time had slipped away she scarcely knew how, but now that she had nothing to do but press her face against the win- dow-pane, and strain her gaze- into the dismal, dimly-lighted street below, the time seemed very long, indeed. Sitting alone, with no other com- pany than her own thoughts, it was quite natural that Janet Soyer should go back in memory over her past life, taking it up thread by thread and weaving into it some bright hopes for the future.   THE DEPTHS OF PO VERT.     17 As far back as she could remember she had lived with an old woman that she called "Aunt Mag," who, they said, had taken care of Janet since she was a little baby. Aunt Mag was very kind, and Janet loved her as a mother. She remembered when she first heard that her own mother was insane and her father was Mr. Soyer instead of Aunt Mag's husband, she had cried for a long time with a terrible sense of loneliness and be- reavement. She was afraid, too, of her own father when he first came to see her, and would not go to him until he bribed her with candy and toys. After a time, however, she grew very fond of him, and would go every afternoon to the next street to watch for him, going home from his work, that she might walk a little way with him. Then one day when she was five or six years old, a woman came to Aunt Mag's house, and as Janet came into the room Aunt Mag said, "Janet, this is your mother," and the woman sprang forward and clasped Janet in her arms, and cried and said, "Oh, my little baby, my blessed Janet." And Janet was afraid and cried, and wondered how her mother had got away from the place where crazy people are locked up. "Your mother has been sick a long time, Janet, but she is well now,     18    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. and you must love her very dearly because she she loves you," said Aunt Mag, wiping her eyes, and stroking Janet's hair softly to re-assure her. After this Janet's father came and took Janet and her mother away, and they rented rooms and went to housekeeping. They might have been very happy together,-but Janet's mother had seen better days, and instead of making the best of things she was always thinking and talking about what she once had, and how they need never have been so poor if Mr. Soyer had man- aged right and kept people from cheating him. Then Janet's father would get discouraged, and would go to the nearest dram-shop to " drown his troubles" he said; and when he came home stag- gering and silly from the effects of the liquor he had taken, Janet's mother would sob and cry and rock herself to and fro, and scarcely speak to any one for days afterwards. So things kept going from bad to worse until Janet's little sister Nellie was born, and Janet's mother became again insane and had to be taken away to the asylum, where she would be kept from doing harm to herself or any one else. Janet's face grew very sad as she sat thinking   THE DEPTHS OF POVERTr.     19 of that time, and seemed almost to hear again little Nellie's cry for her mother. Such a sweet child as Nellie'grew to be! Janet loved to think of all her little sayings and doings, -how she gave the kitten a bath in the dish-pan one day, and brushed its fur down smooth and nice with Lizzie's tooth-brush,-how angry Lizzie was, and how surprised little Nell looked, quite unable to understand what harm there could be in it that Lizzie should scold her. "I dave her a nice baff, and she is dest as teen as tan be," said little Nell in her sweet baby way that Janet loved to remember. Such thoughts, however, always led one way and had one ending, and that was a little green mound in the cemetery, where baby Nell lay sleeping, aged four years and six months. How lonely everything seemed after she died, and what heart-breaks Janet had finding a little dress or broken toy that reminded her of the baby- sister. Then the first Sunday after Nellie died and Janet went to Sunday-school alone and the teacher asked "Where's your little sister to-day, Janet?" and poor Janet broke down in a sob as she an- swered, "She's dead, ma'am." How vividly memory brought it all back;-     20    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. the wondering pity of the scholars and the kindly sympathy of the teacher, Miss ]Mowhray, as she walked home with Janet that day and told her how much happier little Nell would be in the beautiful morning-land of Heaven, where there is no sorrow nor any tears. And listening to the sweet story of Christ's love for little children poor Janet said with a sob: "Oh, Miss Mowhray, if I might have gone, too I Do you think the angels would love me and carry me in their arms beside the still waters and sit with me in the green fields and crown my forehead with the sweet fresh lilies that grow in the far country?" And dropping her eyes pityingly, Miss Mow- bray said softly, "When God calls you, my little Janet, His angels will come for you and lift you out of all sorrow and pain, and make you very happy; but you must wait until He has prepared a place for you. He knows best when it is time for you to go, and He will not keep you here one hour longer than is necessary. Some souls grow best on earth and some best in Heaven-just as some plants grow best in one kind of soil and others grow best in another kind. You must be content to wait God's time." "But, oh, the angels, the beautiful angels, with   THE DEPTHS OF POVERTT   .  21 their sweet, soft voices, and tender sheltering arms- I dream of them, and sometimes - Iwant them!" Janet put out her hands with a passionate cry, and Miss Mowhray folded them close in her own and said, with tears filling her eyes, "If you want to be with the angels, Janet, you must try to be like them. They are beautiful and loving because they are willing to do God's will. They know how to pity your pain and love you in your sor- row, because they have lived on earth, and by suffering have become pure. The holiest angels are the happiest, and if you want to be happy you must trust God. You must believe that He loves you and is doing always for you the best that can be done. If you believe this you will be always willing to do as He wants you to do. When you are troubled and anxious, and your life seems full of darkness, you must pray God to lead you; you must ask Him to show you the way that leads to light and joy;-then He will give His angels charge of you, and though you can not see them they will be near you by day and by night. They can love you while you are on earth, and when you have learned all of your lessons in this world     22    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. you will be ready for the shining robe that awaits you in Heaven." These words sank deep in Janet's heart, and for many days afterwards they followed her like the sweet breath of a fragrant flower. And after this, when she asked Miss Mowhray one day what lessons she. must learn on earth, Miss Mowhray said: "You must learn to think more of making others happy than of making yourself happy; you must learn to be patient when others are unreasonable; learn to forgive those who do you an injury; learn to believe that God can make all thngs-- sorrow and poverty and unkindness and loneliness-work together for good if you but love Him and try to do His will" The town-clock struck nine as Janet sat think- ing of these things and waiting for her father to come home. The sound roused her from the rev- ery into which she had fallen, and she started to her feet to peer once again eagerly into the street below. Vain, all in vain! There were only the faint glimmer of the gaslights and the confused hum of voices to greet poor little Janet's eyes and ears. Half an hour longer she waited, then hastily   THE DEPTHS OF POVERTr.      23 throwing a light shawl around her, she went down the rickety old stair-way and stood on the street below, that she might have a better opportunity to watch for her father. Some rude boys, how- ever, passing soon afterwards, caught her arm roughly, and frightened her so that she was glad to run in to a neighbor's living near by. "Oh, Mrs. Flanigan," she said, as soon as she could recover her breath from the fright into which she had been thrown, "it is after nine o'clock, and father hasn't come home yet. Does Mr. Flanigan know anything about him  They were working together last week, I know." "Sure, child, and it's Mr. Flanigan that hasn't got home yet nayther, though I've looked for him ivery minute since six o'clock." There was a crumb of comfort in this to poor little Janet; for somehow her father seemed safer with Mr. Flanigan than if he had been alone. Weary and faint with watching and waiting she fell asleep after a time in her chair, and kind- hearted Mrs. Flanigan lifted her softly and laid her on a low trundle-bed, saying to herself, "Poor child, it's a hard time she has of it, with the same as no mother, and a trifling sister that puts all the work on her."     24    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. Janet was too tired to waken easily, so that she slept on quite undisturbed, though Mr. Flanigan came home after a time and told his wife that Janet's father had been thrown from his team and badly hurt,-so badly, indeed, that he had been taken to the City Hospital, and this was why he could not get home sooner. "And sure it's the hand of the Lord that led her in here to have a good night's sleep before she can hear a word about it at all," said Mrs. Flanigan, going to the corner where Janet slept, to be sure that she was quite comfortable. "And was it the hand of the Lord that let her father get hurt, too " asked Mr. Flanigan, peering over his tea-cup at his wife. "Och, Patrick, it's not for the likes of ye to be askin' questions about what the Lord does. He nmaes it for good. He must mane it for good; - a lesson, maybe, to Janet's father to let liquor alone." "' The Doctor thinks Michael will be after lettin' whisky alone this time. He's got a bad cut in his head," said Mr. Flanigan, speaking lower lest Janet should waken. "And if he should die, Pat, it's still the Lord's   THE DEPTHS OF POVERTT.     25 work; though what's to become of the child, Pat, I can't see." "She seems to be well enough off where she is," said Pat, significantly. "Sure and she can't stay there always; - for haven't we our own baby to find food and clothes for. We've got our own to work for, Pat, without taking in any more." "And can't you trust anything, Bridget, to ' the hand of the Lord' to help ye out a bit?" said Pat, mischievously. "Get out, Pat, with the nonsense of ye; don't I ask enough of the Lord now, without askin' any more for other people. It's not for the likes of me to be unreasonable." "And is it so little then that He has to give that you're afraid to ask enough for one poor child without a home or any one to take care of her? Well, Bridget Flanigan, you can save for your own, but ye may die after all and leave your child to them as will refuse it a shelter through fear of askin' too much of the Lord." This was a home-thrust, and Bridget got up uneasily and looked at her baby several minutes before she spoke. At last she said, "Well, Pat, we can keep Janet awhile anyhow, and she can 2     26    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. mind the baby while I'm out waship', and maybe I can earn enough for the two." "Then it's small dependence ye put in the hand of the Lord, Bridget, to help ye. You'd rather rely on what ye can earn yourself than what He can give." "And haven't ye said yourself, Pat, that the Lord helps them that help themselves. Get along with ye, and don't be fillin' the room with your nasty smoke. It's tobacco that I'll die of if the Lord spares my life." "Sure and how can ye die, Bridget, if the Lord spares your life?" asked Pat, knocking the ashes from his pipe and preparing for bed. "Och, Pat, what a fool's question that is! Do you suppose the Lord would be after sparing my life always and that I shall niver die a " At this moment the baby began to stir uneasily, and the husband and wife kept very quiet lest it should waken. The sun shining brightly in at the window the next morning crept up to Janet's pillow and roused her from a dream of little Nell and the angels who carried her beside the still waters of the glad Eden- land. Janet sprang up quickly, quite bewildered to find herself in a strange bed. In a moment,   THE DEPTHS OF POVERTT.     27 however, she remembered the weary watching and suspense of the night before, and she asked eagerly, "' Did father come home last night, Mrs. Flanigan?" "Come now, Janet, and have a bit of breakfast first, and then I'll tell ye all about it," said Mrs. Flanigan, with an accent of pity in her voice that puzzled Janet sorely. "I hope nothing has happened to father," she said, trying to swallow a mouthful of food that threatened to choke her. "He has been a dear good father to me, and I don't know what I'd do if anything should happen to him." "'But things must happen to folks sometimes, you know, Janet, but it all comes out right in the end," said Mrs. Flanigan, putting another lump of sugar in Janet's coffee and trying to think how best to tell the story. After all there was very little to tell;--the horses that Janet's father was driving had become unmanageable and Mr. Soyer had been thrown from his seat and badly hurt and they had taken him to the hospital. "What is the hospital?" asked Janet, with a white terror and pain settling over her face. "Sure and it's a nice large building where sick     28    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. folks are taken, and where they have a doctor to attend on them and good nurses to wait on them, and everything handy and beautiful, and no money to pay for anything either," explained Mrs. Flani- gan soothingly. "Could I go and see him?" asked Janet in a scared, pitiful way that quite went to Mrs. Flani- gan's heart and made her reply warmly- "Of course ye can, child, and ye can just tell your father that he needn't worry about what's to become of ye; I'll keep ye myself until he gets well and gets to work again, and it's never a cent of pay I'll take for the keeping of ye." "You are very kind, Mrs. Flanigan, and if father gets well I'm sure he will pay it all back to you, but if he don't get well ---" poor Janet could only stop and cry, - the thought of her father's dying was too terrible. "And if he don't get well, just you never mind. I'll see that you don't come to want! As long as I've enough to keep one, I've enough to keep two," said Mrs. Flanigan, rocking to and fro with her baby in her arms, and looking kindly at Janet. At this moment there was a knock at the door, and Lizzie Soyer entered. "Oh, Lizzie, have you heard about father? He   THE DEPTHS OP PO VERTr.     29 was thrown from his wagon, and they took him to the hospital. I'm afraid he is badly hurt. Did any one tell you about it?" "No," answered Lizzie, "I have just got home. I staid all night at the Turpins last night, and I've just got back." "Oh, Lizzie, how could you stay all night there, when father has told you so many times that he did not want you to go with the Turpins," asked Janet reproachfully. "Oh, do shut up about the Turpins, and tell me about father," said Lizzie impatiently. ( There is nothing more to tell," replied Janet, "but I think we had better go around to the hos- pital and see how he is, and if he wants anything." Lizzie readily agreed, and in a few minutes the sisters were on their way to the hospital. "I had a splendid time with Josephine Turpin last night," said Lizzie, after the two had reached the street. "Iow splendid? What did you do " asked Janet sorrowfully. "Oh, we went to a dance that some fellows gave in ia lager-beer saloon, and we had lots of fun." "Why, Lizzie Soyer; how could you go to     30    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. such a place?" asked Janet with no little surprise and indignation. "What harm was there, pray And who are you, a chit of a girl twelve years old, to be scold- ing me, when I'm eighteen. You may say what you please about the Turpins, I've no one else to go with, and I can't stay in the house all the time." "But, Lizzie, you know if mother were at home she would never let you go with the Turpins. They are low, quarrelsome people, and father has said no good would come of knowing them." "Well, if you tell father anything about it while he is hurt, you will just worry him for nothing, besides, maybe, giving him a fever, and making him a great deal worse," said Lizzie, knowing that Janet would act first and always for her father's comfort. After this the two walked on in silence until they reached the hospital where their father was lying. They found him free from pain, yet quite weak and despondent. "Lizzie can go out to service, and take care of herself; but it's thinking what's to become of you, Janet, that takes the heart out of me," said the father, holding fast the hand of his favorite child.  "Mrs. Flanigan told me to tell you that I could   THE DEPTHS OF POVERTY.     31 stay with her until you could get well and go to work again," said Janet, with a brave' effort to smile and cheer her father as much as possible. "Until I get well, Janet! Tell Bridget Flani- gan she's a brave woman, with a mother's heart in her bosom, and may the Lord reward her." Soon after this the sisters took their leave, prom- ising to come soon again. "Poor, dear father," said Janet, as the two hur- ried along the street together. "Oh, yes; poor, dear father," rejoined Lizzie bitterly. "He was very much worried with thinking what would become of you, but he had no thought of what would become of me. I could go out and knock around any way,--it was no concern of his what happened to me. Go out to service -yes, and work myself half to death while I'm young and ought to be having a little pleasure." "Don't talk so, Lizzie dear; you know father was only worried about me because I am too little to go out to service and earn my own living, and I'm sure I don't know what I should do if it were not for Mrs. Flanigan. She was so kind and motherly, too, Lizzie. I don't know what I shall ever do to pay her for it all."     32   -   HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. "Pay her, indeed!" rejoined Lizzie scornfully. "No fear but that she will get her pay out of you. She don't care anything for you; she only wants you to carry that great baby of hers around, and wait on her. You're a fool if you think she cares anything for you. Anybody would give you a crust of bread and a corner to sleep in, to have you wait on them from morning till night." These were cruel words, and they sank with chiliing force upon poor little Janet's bruised hear;. It had been so sweet to believe that some one cared for her and would give her sheker, not as a servant, but as a child. So bright had been this hope that when it was dispelled Janet seemed to grope in utter darkness. She could not speak, and something sadder than tears filled her heart and quivered on her face. "Well, why don't you say somethings? What are you sulking about Are you any better than I am that you shouldn't be a servant as well as me?" asked Lizzie petulantly. "No, Lizzie, I wasn't thinking that I am any better than you, but it seems so lonesome to have no one to care for you except for the work you can do for them. I don't mind the work, I love to work; but oh, Lizzie, I want to be loved."   THE DEPTHS OF POVERTT.     33 It was a pitiful cry that I am sure the angels heard and remembered. Even Lizzie was soft- ened for a moment, but it was only for a moment, and then she said, in a hard, bitter way, "Well, by the time you're as old as I am, you will find out that people care for you only for what they can make out of you. It's no use expecting what you wont get." Janet made no reply, and, in a few minutes, they reached Mrs. Flanigan's. How hard and cheerless everything looked now, that, in the morning, had seemed so tender and sheltering, so kind and pitying, to poor, sad, little Janet 1 "Could it be as Lizzie said," she asked herself, *'that nobody would care for her except for the work she could do? Would no one ever take her close and tender into their heart, and love her for. her very own self, no matter what she did or did not do " The burden of these thoughts lay very heavily on the heart of Janet Soyer, - and they shut out for a time all the sunshine that had brightened her future. Her duties at Mrs. Flanigan's were really very light, and she could have been very grateful and happy but for the oppressive consciousness of servi- 2*     34    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. tude that Lizzie had put upon her. It would have been almost as good as play minding the baby but for the thought that kept coming to her about no- body's caring for her except for the work that she could do. And if Mrs. Flanigan praised her quick- ness or industry, Janet could not help feeling that she was of no importance only as she could work. In spite of all this, however, there were times when she was almost happy. Such a time came when her father got well and was able to work. With his first wages he bought Mrs. Flanigan a neat, new, calico dress, and gave Janet a dime to spend for sweetmeats. He took tea with the Flanigans that evening, and Janet had never been happier in all her life than when she sat on his knee, after the tea-things were cleared away and the baby put to sleep, and felt that he, at least, of all the world, loved her for her very own self, and not for the work she could do. Lizzie had not succeeded in getting a place, but was staying with her father at a cheap boarding- house, and was as discontented and indolent as ever. One day Mrs. Flanigan was going out to wash, and told Janet to stay in-doors with the baby, and on no account to leave the house until her return.   THE DEPTHS OF POVERTr.      35 Janet readily promised, and after washing and wiping the breakfast dishes, and making the room neat and nice as possible, she sat down to play with the baby, and felt almost happy. About noon-time Lizzie came in and said, "Here, Janet, you must run and take father's dinner to him; I'll stay here until you come back." "Oh, Lizzie, I can't go! Mrs. Flanigan told me to be sure and not go out while she was gone! Why can't you take father's dinner to him ." "Because I can't and I won't; and if you don't choose to carry it, he will have to do without lhis dinner, for I shan't take it," and-Lizzie threw her- self into a chair with an air of meaning what she said that could not be mistaken. Janet could not endure the thought of her father's going without his dinner, and so, after a little more regret at being obliged to disobey Mrs. Flanigan, and telling Lizzie to be sure and stay in-doors with the baby, Janet took up her father's dinner- pail and hurried off with it. She had a long dis- tance to go and it was almost night when she got back. Lizzie, after getting the baby to sleep, had gone off, in pursuit of her own pleasure, and left it quite alone, so that when Mrs. Flanigan returned,     36    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS, she found the baby crying lustily, and no one near it, Janet's explanations of how she came to disobey Mrs. Flanigan were worse than useless. Nothing could appease the indignant mother but telling Janet that she must find another home. Another home - Where could it be, when only that after- noon her father had said to her, "You must try very hard to please Mrs. Flanigan, so that she will not get tired of keeping you; for being out of work so long has put me behind a great deal, and I have no money to pay your board any other place just now." It seemed, after this, a cruel fate that drove poor Janet out that autumn evening homeless!   CHAPTER II. THE DEPTHS OF DESPONDENCY. O0 MSERABLE to shed a tear, too wretched even to think connectedly, poor little Janet hurried along through the chill night air to her father's boarding-place. It was a dingy, comfortless-looking house, per- vaded by a mingled odor of cabbage and tobacco. The cheerless rooms were only half-lighted by the small lamps whose feeble blaze struggled through their smoked chimneys in a dismal way that was very depressing. Janet's story was soon told. Lizzie expressed great indignation against Mrs. Flanigan, yet never seemed, for a moment, to take the blame upon herself, where it so justly belonged. Indeed, she was one of those persons who are always ready to censure others for their own misdeeds. Moreover, as it was not in her nature to be grateful for any kindness she might receive, she was always de- manding more than she had any reason to expect.     38    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. "Anyhow it was kind for Mrs. Flanigan to keep me as long as she did," said Janet gratefully. "I don't tlinlk so; it's no more than she ought to have done," said Lizzie sharply. "And what ought you to have done, instead of making Janet lose her place?" asked Mr. Soyer reprovingly. "Oh, yes, lay the blame on me; I'm always blamed no matter what I do. Janet is your favor- ite. You always think she is right and I am wrong," began Lizzie, in a whining, injured tone that she invariably adopted when she wished to escape the censure that she so richly deserved. Finding that words were worse than useless, Janet's father smoothed her hair softly, kissed her good-night, and told her she had better go to bed. Going to bed was easy enough, but going to sleep was quite another matter, and for hours Janet tossed and turned from one side of the bed to the other, trying to think out the problem of what was to be done with her. I ow many plans suggested tlemselves! One moment sle resolved to go back to Mrs. Flanigan, and promise that she would never, never again, be guilty of the slight- est disobedience, and so entreat to be taken back. Then, remembering that Mrs. Flanigan was really   THE DEPTHS OF DESPONDENCT.    39 too poor to keep her, and was, perhaps, glad of a pretext for getting rid of her, Janet's heart would sink within her, and tears would force themselves down her pale cheeks. The next moment she would rouse herself to think of some other plan. "I must do something," sle would say, "for how can father afford to pay Lizzie's board and mine - when he earns only ten dollars a week at his work?" How, indeed! And so the child groaned and toiled under a burden of perplexity that would have wearied one much older than herself! She never, thought, for a moment, of idly depending upon her father, and leaving him to work and worry alone as best he might. It never occurred to her that she was a child and he was a Iman, and ought to take care of her in her youth and help- lessness. She never thought of blaming him, as Lizzie would have done, for not managing better. She only wondered how she could help him, and wished she could bear for him all the burden of life. - My little children, do you think that God forgot Janet, struggling alone in the darkness, with her weight of anxious thought? I do not think so! I think that His dear, lov-     40    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. ing mother-angels stood close beside her and whispered among themselves, saying, "Her sor- row is bitter, but it will teach her Patience, and Patience will help her to overcome sin and death, and win for her the crown of immortal life." And I think these good angels waited that, in due season, they might draw nearer to the child, and soothe her to slumber and kiss all tears from her eyes, and give her sweet dreams of rest and peace. I am quite sure, too, that these same good angelI stood near her the next morning when she wak- ened, refreshed by sleep and eager to do battle with the gaunt wolf of Poverty that had shadowed her footsteps ever since she could remember. "I think, father," she said cheerily, as soon as she had finished eating her breakfast, " that I will go out to look for a place to take care of some one's baby. Mrs. Flanigan said I knew how very well to keep her baby quiet, and I'm sure there must be some one, richer than Mrs. Flanigan, who would let me tend baby for my board, even if they wouldn't give me anything more." Janet's father stroked her hair caressingly, and said she might try if she chose, though if she failed   THE DEPTHS OF DESPONDENC r.    41 it was no matter, as he could take care of her very well. Janet smiled back cheerily in her father's face, nevertheless she understood very well how neces- sary it was that she should do something for her- self. All the world seemed brighter and more hope- ful by daylight than it had seemed the night before, and Janet started off briskly to inquire from house to house if anybody wanted a little nurse-girl. She concluded to seek-more pleasant- looking streets and houses than any to which she had been accustomed, and after considerable walk- ing found herself in a portion of the city where it seemed reasonable that she might find some one who could afford to employ her. With trembling haste she rang the bell of an imposing-looking mansion, and asked timidly of the servant who came to the door, if the lady of the house wanted a little girl to tend baby for her board. "Get out, you little ragamuffin, ringing the front-door bell! Why didn't you ring the bell down stairs And the door was slammed violently in Janet's face. She went down the broad, stone steps quite bewildered, and it was some minutes before she could summon sufficient     42    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. courage to make another attempt. This time she rang the basement bell, and a pleasant-faced girl opened the door and said kindly there was no baby in the house, but the lady who lived opposite had a baby and might need some one. Janet thanked the girl, and hurried across the street as directed. The smile and the kind word bright- ened and rested her wonderfully. The house opposite was a brown-stone front, with a bay window, and had altogether a cheery look about it that Janet thought must make it very delightful to live in. She rang the bell and a little girl no older than herself answered the summons. Janet repeated her inquiry that, by this time began to seem very old and tiresome. The little girl listened to her; and then turning back in the hall and stopping at the staircase called, "Mamma, here's a little girl wants to nurse a baby; do you want her?" "Tell her to come up stairs," was the rejoinder, and the next moment Janet was following the little girl up the broad staircase, and into a pleas- ant sitting-room, where the bright pictures on the wall and flowers in the window seemed to Janet like a glimpse of heaven. A small, blue-eyed lady, with a sour little frown between her eye-   THE DEPTHS OF DESPONDENCT.    43 brows, said somewhat sharply, as Janet stood staring about her, bewildered by the unusual splendor, "Well, what is it that you want, child?" "I should like a place to take care of a baby for my board," replied Janet flushing and trembling. Are your parents living?" asked the lady. "Yes, ma'am," said Janet. "I don't know about taking a child who has parents; Julia, what do you think?" asked the lady turning suddenly to another lady that Janet had not before observed. "Oh, I don't know, Anna," responded Julia, "do as you think best. Of course you run the risk of supporting two families. Such creatures don't have children for any other purpose than to steal. It's the easiest way to make a living, I suppose they think." "What does your father do?" asked the. first lady. "He drives a team for another man," responded Janet. "And your mother,--does she take in wash- ing, or do anything to help your father make a living?" ("My mother is insane, and has been in the asy- lum a long time," said Janet.     "   HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. "Insane, oh, dear me; of course it's in the family, and there would be no safety in employ- ing such a person. I believe so much in inherited tendencies, Julia, don't you?" Julia nodded assent, and the first lady said, "You may go now, little girl, I don't want you!" Poor little Janet gave one lingering glance at the flowers, and the pictures, and the bright car- pet, and the cross lady with blue eyes, and every- thing seemed to repeat, "You may go now, little girl, I don't want you!" Even after she reached the street it rang in her ears; and the blue sky and broad stone pave- ments, and even the grim lamp-posts, seemed saying, "You may go now, little girl, I don't want you," until Janet was ready to scream back at them in an agony of despair, "Go where? I haven't any place to go!" Twelve o'clock, and still Janet had found no one to employ her. Faint with hunger and fatigue she entered the gate in front of a modest little cottage, and this time she only asked to rest awhile. A tidy young woman, with a smiling face and a kindly voice, bade her come in, and Janet was only too grate- ful for the privilege.   THE DEPTHS OF DESPONDENCr.    45 A savory odor of baked apples and broiled beefsteak greeted her as she went in, and made her more hungry than ever. "Do you live far from here?" asked the woman kindly, as she buttered the steak and turned the apples around to see if they were quite done. "I live a long way," answered Janet, "and I've been out since early morning looking for a place where I could tend baby for my board." The woman looked up in surprise, and asked kindly, "Are you not a very little girl. to be out looking for a place You are not more than nine years old, are you?" "I'm twelve," answered Janet; and the two quite naturally drifted into a confidential little talk. The woman's name was Mrs. Hunter, and she had been married only a few weeks. Her husband was clerk in a dry-goods store, and she had lived in the country before her marriage, she told Janet. In return for this confidence Janet told all about when Nellie died and her father was hurt, and how kind Mrs. Flanigan had been, and how tired she had got looking for a place, and Mrs. Hunter grew quite sympathetic and gave Janet a baked apple and a potato, and some nice beefsteak and a warm buttered roll;-     "    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. so that Janet felt quite refreshed and almost hope- ful again. The afternoon, however, brought no better sue- cess than the morning, and quite disheartened Janet was wending her way toward the dismal quarters she had left in the morning, -when a man standing on a street-corner accosted her with, "Where are you going, little girl 2" "I'm going to Mrs. Murphy's, where my father boards," replied Janet. "Where have you been?" asked the man. "I've been to look for a place to tend baby," said Janet. "Oh, then I can find you a nice place; come with me," said the man. Janet looked up in his face and involuntarily shrank back;--it was so dark and forbidding a countenance that confronted her. It was only a moment that she hesitated. Joy at finding a place, and being able to help her father, overcame any fears that might otherwise have influenced her, and she followed eagerly the man, who had already started on a few steps ahead of her. He led her up one street and down another, and across into still another, every now and then look-   THE DEPTHS OF DESPONDENCT.    47 ing back stealthily to see if they were followed, and at last he darted swiftly down a dark alley, and told Janet to follow him. Something, how- ever, made her pause with sudden fright, and another glance at the man, who was now some distance ahead of her and beckoning to her angrily, made her turn and run down the street the way she had come as fast as her feet could carry her. She fancied she heard the man pursuing her, but she was too much frightened to look behind her until she had reached a broad street, where the lamps were burning brightly, and the busy crowd of passers-by kept her from being afraid. When she reached Mrs. Murphy's she found her father quite anxious about her, and more than glad to see her back safe and well. She was pale and trembling, however, with fright and fatigue, and her father held her in his arms and soothed her as best he could. "Why do you think that man wanted me to go down that dark alley, father?" asked Janet, when she had finished telling her story of the day's expe- rience. "Och, Janet, there's a lot of dirty, low thieves that steal children and keep them until the parents give a reward for finding them," said Michael     48    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. Soyer, with a hot flush mantling his swarthy face as he held Janet closer in his arms. After a time he said, "Now, Janet, let this teach you a lesson; never to speak to strangers on the street, nor follow a person unless you know where you're going. And you needn't go out any more to look for a place. You're too little; Lizzie shall go, but you must stay with your father." It seemed so nice and safe to be in her father's arms, so restful after the day's wearying march, that Janet dropped asleep before she realized that she was even sleepy, and so sound were her slum- bers that she did not waken when her father car- ried her to her own bed and left her for the night. The next day was Sunday, and Janet wak- ened with the feeling that she would like to go to Sunday-school; accordingly, so soon as she had finished her breakfast and dressed herself as neatly as her scanty wardrobe would allow, she went out in answer to the sweet chiming of the morning bells that seemed laden with the beauti- ful Christ-message: "Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest." It had been a long time since Janet had been to Sunday-school, and she felt as if it would do her   THE DEPTHS OF DESPONDENCr.    49 a great deal of good to see Miss Mowhray once again, and hear her speak in the gentle mother- tones that Janet l1Yed Do well.  It was this longing that made her go to Sunday- school, though if she had listened to another voice that every now and then whispered in her heart, she would have staid at home, for the voice said, "Your dress is old and worn, Janet; the ribbon on your hat is faded, and you will look very shabby beside the other little girls, who will be handsomely dressed in fresh, new, fall suits of bright, warm colors; and perhaps they won't like to sit by you in your old things." Once Janet halted and thought she would go back, but the sweet Sabbath-bells kept calling her to go on, and so she closed her ears to the voice that talked of her clothes, and, bathed in the clear morning sunshine and thinking of Miss Mowhray, she forgot everything else. Miss Mowhray was just going in as Janet got to the church-door, and she stopped a moment to say, "How do you do, Janet? I am very glad to see you." And when Janet said, "Thank you, Miss Mow- bray, I am very well," the lady smiled and said, 8     50    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. "I am not Miss Mowhray any longer. I am Mrs. Langdon now; I am married." Then they both went in, and the children were singing - "I want to be an angel, And with the angels stand; A crown upon my forehead, A harp within my hand." Janet looked at the long rows of brightly- dressed children, and thought how much nicer it would be in Heaven, where they would be all dressed in their white robes and beautiful crowns, and not one would stand in shabby, faded clothes, as she stood, wishing to be like the rest. Mrs. Langdon, the teacher, must have guessed something of this from Janet's face, for she took occasion to say to her class that day: "The clothes that we wear on our bodies, my little cltl- dren, are of small value; for, no matter how new and handsome they may be at first, they become, after we have worn them. awhile, old and faded. A spot falls here, a rent is made there, the smu fades the goods, the fashions change, and our gar- ments are sure to look shabby and threadbare if we wear them long enough. But there are gar- ment* more beautiful than any that our bodies   THE DEPTHS OF DESPONDENCr.     51 have ever worn or that our eyes have ever seen, and they are the garments that our souls wear. These do not fade, nor grow threadbare from use, but become more beautiful the longer they are worn." The children seemed very much interested, and Mrs. Langdon said she would tell them a little story that would, perhaps, better illustrate her meaning. Accordingly she began: "The servants of a great king were once gath- ered together at a merry-making of their own, and, attired in their holiday suits, they were feeling very grand and gay, when a stranger was ad- mitted who craved shelter. He seemed to be a gentle-spoken man, but he wore an old serge gown and cape, and seemed quite fatigued and poverty-stricken. "He soon became an object of ridicule to the merry-making servants, for they were ignorant people, and knew no other means of judging a man than by the clothes he wore. "They did not notice that the stranger had a pleasant voice, and a noble and dignified manner. They were not capable of judging of these things. They noted only that he was shabbily dressed, was alone and seemed friendless and unprovided for.     52    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. Accordingly they treated him very rudely. They continually jested about his appearance, and when supper was announced mockingly gave him a seat of honor that they might the more effectually wound and ridicule him. "When the banquet was ended, and the mirth and insolence were at their height, suddenly the stranger rose from his seat, cast aside the serge gown he had worn, and revealed the royal apparel -of a prince. It was the king's son that had been among them in disguise, and when this discovery was made the terror and amazement of the ser- vants knew no bounds." Mrs. Langdon paused a moment, and then she said: "My little children, we must never judge of one by the outer garment. It is the inner rai- ment that we must consider, for it is this that God considers. When you stand at the pearly gates, and wait for an angel to uplift their shining por- tals to you, the dresses or the laces or the ribbons that you wore on earth will not be remembered for a moment. Christ will not ask, "How much money had your iather ,? How many drve*e* had your mother?"He will only look into your faces for the meek and quiet spirit, the redeemed and purified soul, that He gave you so many years on   THE DEPTHS OF DESPONDENCr.     53 earth to work for. If these are wanting you will find no place prepared for you. "When the outer garment of the body is cast aside, you will be seen as you are, and if your soul is spotted with sin and stained with foolish pride, and bears upon it the hideous marks of a vain and selfish life that was spent in seeking pleasure, instead of doing good, there will be no vain, flut- tering ribbons to hide this poverty of soul, and make you appear other than you are." The children were very quiet and attentive, and Janet's eyes brimmed over with tears. Mrs. Langdon waited for a few moments, and then she said: "God does not always find it best to allow us money sufficient to deck our bodies in the costly garments that we all admire; but there is nothing but our own wicked hearts to prevent us from adorning our souls with the beautiful robes that neither in life nor in death can be taken away from us." "How can we make the robes, that our souls wear, beautiful?" asked a little girl in the class, bending forward eagerly. "By the thoughts we think and the deeds we do," said Mrs. Langdon. "Every time we think that we are better than others because we dress     54    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. better than they do; and every time we envy others who seem better off than ourselves we mar the beauty of the garments that our bouls must wear. And every time that we sacrifice our own comfort and convenience to make others happy, we make for ourselves the shining spirit-robes that are imperishable." Mrs. Langdon paused, and Janet caught her breath with a sigh that seemed to uplift from her heart a weight and burden that had been carried in much weariness and pain All at once she seemed to realize how little it mattered that the ribbon on her hat was faded, and her dress shabby and worn. All at once her face grew luminous and tearful, with the thought that it lay in her power to be clothed in the beautiful robe of godliness, and to stand one day at the jasper walls of the New Jeru- salem waiting for admittance, in her wedding gar- ment of the meek and quiet spirit that Christ, for His very love's sake, wants His children to have! After Sunday-school was dismissed, Mrs. Lang- don lingered awhile to talk with Janet, and ask her what she had been doing all the long time since she had seen her. Janet was glad to find so sympathetic a listener,   THE DEPTHS OF DESPONDENCY.    55 and told quite frankly her perplexities. How she had looked for a place and could not find any, and how her father thought, as Lizzie was older and stronger, she might go out to service, so that Janet could stay with him. Mrs. Langdon listened with kind attention, and then she said: "I am keeping house now, and my cook left me yesterday.. If your sister Lizzie is a good cook, I might engage her. At any rate I will give you my address and you can send her to me in the morning, and I will see what arrange- ments can be made." Janet went home that day with a light heart, eager to tell her father and Lizzie the glad news that Mrs. Langdon would probably engage Lizzie to work for her. Mr. Soyer was very much pleased with the prospect. It solved at once the perplexing prob- lem of how to get something to eat and to wear. Lizzie, however, received the news ungraciously, and expressed herself as being quite doubtful as to whether she would accept the situation. Mrs. Murphy, overhearing this, made bold to say that she thought it the best thing that Lizzie could do, and that she herself had no fancy for boarding people when there was no prospect of     58    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS.. being paid for it. This plain speaking had the desired effect, and Lizzie lost no time in seeking the residence of Mrs. Langdon at the appointed hour; and as she did not return that day nor the next it was evident that she had at last found a place. Janet rejoiced with unqualified delight, for, in addition to the burden that this would lift from her father, it could not fail, she thought, to prove advantageous to Lizzie in more ways than one. First, there were the wages; then the prospect of a quiet, pleasant home; but most of all the acquaint- ance and kindness of Mrs. Langdon, and the beau- tiful talks about God's love for us, that Janet thought they must sometimes have. She tried to picture to herself just what such a life must be, and in the midst of her imaginings Lizzie came to tell her all about what she had so much wished to know. "Beautiful talks, indeed," sneered Lizzie, ill answer to an enthusiastic question from Janet. "There's no time for beautiful talks with so much to do. There's a whole house full to work for." "Why, how many are there in the family?2" asked Janet, with no little surprise. "Well, there's Mr. and Mrs. Langdon, an old lady they call Aunt Rachel, Grace and Bessie,   THE DEPTHS OF DESPONDENC'.     57 Mrs. Langdon's two sisters, besides the nurse-girl and Mrs. Langdon's baby," answered Lizzie petu- lantly. "Mrs. Langdon's baby!" exclaimed Janet de- lightedly. "Has she a baby  How old is it?" "It is about two or three months old. She has been married only a year." "Has she been married so long as that? Then she mast have been married soon after I quit going to Sunday-school " said Janet. "Is the baby pretty, Lizzie?" "Oh, I don't know! I don't care much for babies; though I don't have anything to do with this one." "Don't you," said Janet. "I should think you would love to hold it sometimes. I should;- but tell me about her sisters, Grace and Bessie,- are they little girls, or young ladies?" "Bessie is twelve years old, and Grace is four- teen, I think. There is nothing to tell about them except that they are soon to go off to school. I shall be glad, for the washing will be lighter when they are gone." "Is every one kind to you?" asked Janet affectionately. "Oh, kind enough, I suppose. I don't think 3*     58    HRIGHTS AND DtPTHFS. of that so much as I do of having to work so hard. I hate to work!" said Lizzie. "But you know we must work, Lizzie, and it is easier to work where every one is kind than if they were cross all the time. I wish I were old enough to get a nice place; I shouldn't mind the work," rejoined Janet thoughtfully. "You think so because you don't. know any- thing about work," said Lizzie scornfully. Janet was silent for several moments, and then she answered softly: "I do know about work, and I know that it is hard, but I should think all the time of making money and of helping father and you." Lizzie made no reply to this, but shortly after- wards took her leave.   i  CHAPTER III. THE HEIGHTS OF ANIICIPATION. UTUMN had passed, Winter had begun, and in the clhill, gray. dawn of Christmas morning, Janet lay awake trying, as usual, to think a way out of her difficulties. Things had, of late, seemed to be getting darker instead of brighter. She had not seen Lizzie for several weeks, and having no warm winter clothing she had not been able to go to Sunday-school since the cold weather began. In addition to this, her father was out of work, and Mrs. Murphy had declared herself both unable and unwilling to board people for nothing. It was a dismal outlook for poor Janet, and she had not the courage to build even one air-castle as she had been accustomed to do when things were particularly depressing.     60    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. She thought of other girls who could hang up their stockings and have Christmas presents, and kind friends and pleasant homes, until something hard and bitter rose in her heart, and she buried her face in her pillow and sobbed uncontrollably. After a time she stopped from exhaustion, and then she began to think of how Christmas means Christ's birthday, and remembering this helped her to remember the sweet, unselfish life of the blessed Saviour, who endured poverty and hard- ship and suffering for our sakes. Suddenly the words came to her, like a sweet strain of half-for- gotten music, "Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest." Janet drank in all their sweetness, and then she cried, "Lord, help me to come to Thee," and while she prayed the rosy morning blushed along the eastern sky. Meantime Mrs. Langdon was saying, "When you get the breakfast things cleared away, Lizzie, you'may go to see Janet, and tell her to come and spend a week or two with you, if she likes. It will be a pleasant change for her, and if your father is paying her board, it will be a saving for him, besides." Lizzie said, "Thank you, ma'am ;" for, not-   THE HEIGHTS 1 OF ANTICIPA TION.   61 withstanding her indolence and ill-temper, she was quite willing to make Janet happy when she could do so without any inconvenience to herself. Moreover, she was not insensible to the fact that Janet could wash dishes, keep up the fires, and do many little things that would materially assist with the work. These considerations, as well as a natural im- pulse of kindness, such as the worst people have sometimes, made her hasten to accept Mrs. Lang- don's offer; so that before eleven o'clock she was knocking at Mrs. Murphy's door. Janet came to open it, and Lizzie could not but notice the worn, anxious look that had settled on the child's face. A flash of glad recognition, how- ever, went over her features, as she said, "Oh, it's you, Lizzie Come in! I'm so glad to see you 1" "I haven't long to stay," answered Lizzie. "] Mrs. Langdon told me I might come for you to go there with me and spend a week or two." "Oh, Lizzie -- " It was all Janet could say, yet something in her heart seiured her that 0o God had answered her cry of desolation and per- plexity. "I've nothing nice to wear, Lizzie," she said,     62    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. as she buttoned on a little, faded water-proof cloak that was neither warm nor pretty. "It's no matter about that," said Lizzie, and a few minutes later the two were walking briskly along through the winter air; one of them, at least, grateful and almost happy. What a relief it was to get away from the sound of Mrs. Murphy's scolding voice, and away from the wretched odor of whisky and tobacco that always surrounded Mrs. Murphy' boarders; and how Janet reveled in the wide, clean streets and hand- some houses that must be passed to reach the resi- dence of Mrs. Langdon. It was only a brown wooden house, but it was commodious and pleasant, and it seemed to Janet palatial in its magnificence. Mrs. Langdon welcomed her cordially, and Mrs. Langdon's aunt, Miss Rachel Conway, said, "Is this your little sister, Lizzie?" and then shook hands with Janet kindly, and asked her if she knew the ten commandments, and the chief end of man. Janet said she did, and Miss Rachel had her repeat them, and after that Grace and Bessie came in, and they too asked, "Is this your little sister, Lizzie?" and when Lizzie said "Yes; this is Janet," they said "How do you do, Janet,"   -TIE HEIGHTS OF ANTICIPATION.    63 and they gave her some nuts and candy, and offered to lend her a story book to read, and then they went up-stairs again and left the sisters alone together. "Grace is the prettiest, but I think I should like Bessie the best. Which do you like best, Lizzie?" asked Janet, breaking an almond in her fingers and taking the kernel out. "Oh, I don't know which," rejoined Lizzie- "Grace is the good girl, they all say, and Bessie the mad-cap. Grace never soils or tears her clothes, or gets out of temper, but Bessie is always up to something." "How do you mean 'up to something?"' asked Janet. "Oh, at some mischief! Yesterday Mrs. Lang- don went away, and Bessie would boil molasses in the little porcelain preserving kettle, and it burned black, while she was chasing some boys out of the yard, who were teasing a cat that had climbed on the wood-shed," explained Lizzie. "Oh, dear, wasn't it too bad! Was the candy burned so that she couldn't eat it a" asked Janet sympathetically. "Yes, and that wasn't the worst, for, in her haste to pour the molasses out, she knocked a     "    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. large meat-dish off of the kitchen-table and broke it." "Oh, dear, how dreadful!" exclaimed Janet. "Did Mrs. Langdon scold her very much?" "I don't know," rejoined Lizzie, "they took her up-stairs, and when she came down to dinner her eyes were red, as if she had been crying." Janet said "it was too bad," and at this mo- ment Bessie came down to bring the story-book she had promised. "It is full of pretty little stories," she said, seat- ing herself beside Janet, in a confiding little way peculiar to herself. "There's one called 'The Magic Shoes,' and it is all about a boy who had a pair of shoes that would always help him to do right, but would never let him do wrong. Shouldn't you like to have such a pair of shoes?" Janet thought she should, and Lizzie asked playfully," Shouldn't you like to have such a pair, Bessie?" Then Bessie laughed, and said, "Yes, I should like them sometimes, but they would be a great bother to have to wear them all the time." "Should you have liked them yesterday when you were making molasses candy?" asked Lizzie. 'I suppose not," answered Bessie, "but I   THE HEIGHTS OF ANTICIPA TION. 65 should have liked them when I was chasing those boys who teased my poor kitty; for the magic shoes would have made me run faster, so that I could have thrown some water on those bad, mean boys." "It was too bad that your molasses burned," said Janet. "Oh," rejoined Bessie, "did Lizzie tell you about it? Well, I was sorry, too, but I would rather have the molasses burn and the preserving kettle spoil than have my poor little kitty stoned to death by those horrid boys. They hurt her dreadfully anyhow, and the poor dear had climbed on the wood-shed to get out of their way." "Bessie," said Grace, coming into the room, "Sister Ruth wants you upstairs." The two went out, leaving Janet dazzled and overawed, yet happy and content that Bessie had been so kind, even though Grace was so beautiful and unapproachable. "I don't believe Mrs. Langdon sent for Bessie," said Lizzie; "Grace just told her so to get her out of the kitchen to keep her from being so friendly to you." "Why?" asked Janet in amazement, all her sweet Christmas-day suddenly clouded.     "    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. "Oh, well, your father isn't rich, and your sis- ter works for a living, and you haven't any fine clothes, and so you must not be talked to and played with, as if you were anybody." There was no resentment in Janet's face, but a still hopelessness settled over it, and a look sadder than tears came into her eyes. It had been so sweet to come in contact with so much brightness and refinement, to be spoken to so politely and treated so considerately. Janet thought it must be so that the angels treat those who go to Heaven. Then she remembered what Mrs. Langdon said about the beautiful spiritual garments that a soul must wear before it can enter the pearl-gates; and remembering this she resolved to try more than ever to keep her shining spirit-robes spotless. "What are you thinking about, Janet, that you sit so still?" asked Lizzie. "I was thinking, Lizzie, of what Mrs. Langdon told me once at Sunday-school, about how God does not look at, our dresses, or our ribbons or laces, but only into our hearts, and if they are adorned with meek and quiet thoughts that love Him, and praise Him and trust Him, that is all He requires; and it is the thoughts we think and   THE HEIGHTS OF ANTICIPATION. 67 the things we do that will make our souls beauti- ful or hideous. Oh, Lizzie," exclaimed Janet, looking up with a sudden mist of tears blinding her, "I have always worn shabby and faded clothes. I was never dressed pretty, not once in my life, and I love to think that I can, if I will, make my soul beautiful, and not stand shabby and ragged among the angels, and have them think I am not good enough to be with them." Lizzie brushed away a tear that stole hastily down her cheek, and she came over to Janet, and said kindly, "You needn't mind what anybody says. Your clothes don't keep you from being as good as any one." I know," said Janet, " but people don't know that; they think it is what you have on that makes the difference. Don't you know, last sum- mer, how the little girls at school, who were nicely dressed, used to say, 'Go away, Janet Soyer, we can't play with you when you wear such ragged old clothes and go bare-footed ' " "Yes, I remember, but don't think of it, Janet," said Lizzie. "I' only think of it when I am lonesome, and have no one to talk to nme" replied Janet. The kitchen-door was open, and this conversa-     68    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. tion went up-stairs, word for word, to Mrs. Lang- don, who had gone into a little room over the kitchen to take out some canned fruit for dinner. It might have comforted Janet if she could have known that one human heart was yearning over her with a motherliness almost painful in its intensity. She might have felt less alone if she had known that even then Mrs. Langdon was praying for strength and wisdom to lead homeless little Janet where her feet could find the sweet fields and still waters of everlasting peace. Janet did not know this, however, and so she sat, feeling quite alone, as we feel so many times when God is thinking of us and making others think of us. He is always the same, always lov- ing and watchful; it is we who forget how good He is, how certainly He will do always what is best for us, and so we imagine that He forgets because we forget. Bessie came rushing down stairs and into the kitchen, like a swift, fresh morning-breeze that seems always to bring new life and vigor. "Come, Janet," she said; "it is almost dinner-time, and sister Ruth says we must wash our faces and comb our hair and be all ready for dinner. Come up stairs with me."   THE HEIGHTS OF ANTICIPATION. 69 Janet rose to her feet and followed mechanically. She could not come out from her shadow all at once. "You haven't seen sister Ruth's baby, have you?" asked Bessie, balancing herself on one foot as she paused at the threshold of Mrs. Langdon's room and waited for Janet to enter. No, Janet had not seen the baby, and such a round, roly-poly, dimpled darling as it was, asleep in its crib, with one dainty pink hand thrown over its pillow, and the other hidden snugly under the blue and white blanket that covered it. "Isn't she beautiful?" asked Bessie with pride and delight. "She's an angel," rejoined Janet, with enthu- siasm.          r "Well, I suppose she is, because the Bible says of such is the kingdom of Heaven, you know, and it must mean that; but she won't stay so. She'll grow up just as we did. But we must not stop to talk. There is some water for you to wash your face and hands, and I am going to give you this little, new comb for your Christmas present. I had two given to me, and I don't need but one, so you may have the other one." Janet did not say anything, but the look that     70    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. she gave Bessie meant, "Bessie Mowhray, you are the best and kindest girl I ever knew. I love you." Bessie bustled about, getting out her things, and watching Janet out of the corners of her eyes, as if she were studying how best she could make her comfortable. "There," she exclaimed at length, "I have two aprons and two little linen collars almost exactly alike, and you shall wear one of each, and I will wear the other." "Oh, indeed," remonstrated Janet, "I think I had better not. Mrs. Langdon might not like it." "Yes, but Mrs. Langdon will like it, for Mrs. Langdon told me to, or I shouldn't ever have thought of it, Miss Kidlums," said Bessie, play- fully pinching Janet's cheek, and whirling around, like a spinning-top, towards the wash-stand. Janet put on the apron and collar, and felt so clean and respectable, and almost as if she were somebody, when Grace came, and, lifting .her eye- * brows superciliously, said coldly, "Janet, had you not better go down and see if you can't help Lizzie bring in dinner, or do something in the kitchen?" Janet started towards the door, but Bessie   THE HEIGHTS OF ANTICIPATION. 71 caught her hand and said, "No, you shan't; you shall stay with me;" then turning to Grace, she said, "Go yourself, if you are so anxious to help Lizzie." "I'm sure I should if Lizzie were my sister; but she is only a servant and I am a young lady," rejoined Grace, with freezing scorn. "Oh, are you?" said Bessie mockingly. "Well, we are only little girls, too small for you to be meddling with, so run away and let us alone." "Young ladies don't run," said Grace, stalking out of the room with what she imagined a very dignified and imposing air. Janet felt more insignificant than ever, and Bessie said re-assuringly, "You must not mind what Grace says; I don't! She is only fourteen years old; but you see she was brought up by Aunt Rachel, and Aunt Rachel is an old maid, and so prim and ridiculous about some things that I heard sister Ruth say she had spoiled Grace. You must never tell this for sister Ruth don't know that I heard her say it." "I will not tell," said Janet; " but who brought you up?" "Oh, I just came up like a weed, sister Ruth says. I have always been with sister Ruth. She     72    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. isn't my own sister. Her mother died when she was a little girl, and my own mother was sister Ruth's step-mother, and after she died Aunt Ra- chel took Gracie, and sister Ruth kept me with her." Soon after this the two girls went down to din- ner, and Janet thought no dinner vas ever before so wonderful. Oyster soup, roast turkey, cran- berry sauce, grape jelly, plum pudding, and many other things that Janet had heard of yet never eaten. "Is she going to eat with us?" asked Grace, in amazement, as Mrs. Langdon fixed a plate beside Bessie for Janet. "Of course she is; why not?" asked Bessie sharply. "Oh, nothing, cross-patch; only I should think she would feel more at home with her sister," re- joined Grace, in her smooth, even tones, that were cold and cutting as a knife. "Come, come, children! let us have no loud or angry words," said Mrs. Langdon softly. "This is Christ's birthday, you know. The meek and lowly Jesus who was born in a manger." "You oughtn't to tell Grace that Jesus was so   THE HEIGHTS OF ANTICIPATION.    73 poor, sister Ruth, or she will think herself above Him," said Bessie mischievously. "Bessie, dear," said sister Ruth kindly, "we are told to take the beam out of our own eye be- fore we try to pick the mote out of our brother's eye." Besie hung her head, and Janet longed to say, "Oh, there isn't any beam in Bessie's eye. . She is good and kind, and doesn't mean ever to do wrong." Just then, however, Mr. Langdon and Aunt Rachel came in, and they all sat down to dinner. Bessie pulled her chair up very close to Janet, and seemed anxious to make her as comfortable as possible. "Don't fidget so, Bessie," said Aunt Rachel; "sit up straight and act the lady." Bessie made no reply, but Grace ventured to remark, "Bessie is such a tom-boy.' "Grace!" said Mrs. Langdon reprovingly. "Remember first the beam in your own eye." This seemed very appropriate to Janet, and she looked up with an involuntary expression of delight that made her at once and forever an object of dislike to Grace. Aunt Rachel, too, noticed the look, and a mo. 4     74    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. ment after she said quite pointedly, "Don't put your knife in your mouth, Janet. Your knife is is to cut with, and your fork is to eat with." "I always forget that, too," said Bessie, in a low tone, hastening to take the sting out of Miss Rachel's reproof; " and Aunt Rachel has to tell me about it, and about using my own knife instead of the butter-knife when I take butter, and oh, ever so many things. Everybody does some little thing sometime that it is better not to do." Janet turned a look upon Bessie that adored her, and there was no need of saying anything, for Bessie understood, and her heart thrilled and glowed with a happy consciousness that flooded all her face with beauty. - After dinner Mrs. Langdon went to look at her hot-house plants, and Grace, Bessie and Janet went with her. "Oh, see these withered leaves," said Grace, plucking two or three at once from a rose gera- nium that stood near her. "Take care, Grace; you are injuring the plant. See how it bleeds!" said Mrs. Langdon. "Bleeds!" exclaimed Grace; "how can that be " "In pinching the leaves you have broken the   THE HEIGHTS OF ANTICIPA TION.    75 stern, and see how the sap runs out; the sap, you know, is the life-blood of the plant. You have wounded and injured it," exclaimed Mrs. Lang- don. "Why, the leaves were dead, and I thought it better to pluck them. They looked so badly," said Grace. "You should have plucked them more carefully to avoid injuring the stem, besides it is not always best to pluck a leaf as soon as it appears withered." "Next time I shall know better," said Grace. Mrs. Langdon wai silent a moment, and then said, "There is another lesson to learn from this. Shall I tell it to you?" The trio gathered around her, and she said, "These withered leaves may be compared to little faults and foibles that we see marring the charac- ter of our associates. If we deal too roughly even with those faults, we may injure the soul of the person whom we would benefit. At any rate, we may draw the blood from their hearts and wound them cruelly. And sometimes, instead of help- ing, we may really hinder them, for while we correct one fault we may foster another by irritat- ing and hurting them. "Do you remember the parable of the tares     76    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. sown by an enemy among the wheat? The ser- vant, you know, asked his lord if he should go out and pluck the tares from the wheat, but the mas- ter said, Nay, lest in plucking the tares he should also pluck up the young wheat. Let both grow, he said, until they are gathered, and then the wheat can be separated from the chaff. This is intended, I think, to teach us great care and ten- derness in our dealings with a soul, even when onr intentions are the very best; for the soul is as much more delicate and sensitive than a plant as as it is more enduring and important." Mrs. Langdon walked on further, looking at her plants, and bending over them with so much ten- der solicitude that Janet almost wished herself a flower, to be so loved and watched. "See how differently I must treat my plants to make them grow to the best advantage. Some grow best in the shade, so I take them out of the sunshine; while those that need more light I place where the sun can shine full upon them. Some need more water than others, and some more air. Some require trimming, while others do not. You see I must understand what each needs in order to know what to do for them. 1   THE HEIGHTS OF ANTICIPATION.    " love them and I do always what is best for them. Do you suppose they ever distrust me " The girls looked up astonished, and Grace said, "How funny, sister Ruth?" "Don't you suppose the plants that I trim sometimes think, How partial she is, using that sharp knife on me while she spares others?" "Please, Ruthie, tell us what you mean," said Bessie. I mean to show you how God deals with us. To some of us He gives the sunshine of wealth and home and friends, and to others the sharp, pruning knife of affliction that takes from us those we love and leaves us in the shadows of poverty and suffering. He can see just what our souls need to make them grow to the best advantage, and love actuates Him in all that He does for us." "Sometimes," said Janet, speaking involunta- rily, and before she could think what she was going to say, "sorrow makes people cross and wicked and hateful, and men and women who are poor drink to drown their troubles, and they steal to get something to eat for their hungry little children. I should think poverty made them worse." "No," said Mrs. Langdon, "poverty does not     78    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. make them worse; it only shows what they are. If these same people were wealthy they would have other faults quite as bad; and though they might have no temptation to do wrong outwardly, God, who sees the heart, would know their secret tendency to evil. If they were wealthy they might not steal for bread, but they might grind down the wages of the poor, and foster secretly worse passions than they now exhibit openly. We can not judge which would be worst; but God knows, and He looks at every human soul more tenderly than it is possible for us to under- stand, and He does the very best for that soul that can be done for it. We can not always see just what He is doing with us or for us, but we must trust Him and believe that He will make us just as happy as it is possible for us to be." Janet bent over a modest little flower that grew in a shaded corner, and whispered softly, "Let us grow in the shadow, little plant, fragrant and beautiful, since so God wills."   CHAPTER IV. GRACE MOWBRAY'S BIRTHDAY PARTY. RACE  MOWBRAY   was to have a 1  birthday party; and for weeks before- hand there was quite a flutter of excite- ment as to who should be invited and what should be worn. Grace and Bessie had handsome new dresses presented to them by their Aunt Rachel. It was as good as a story for Janet to watch the prepara- tions, yet the anticipated grandeur seemed as far above and beyond her as could be imagined. That she should be taken into account had neyer entered her mind; and her astonishment was only equaled by her delight when Mrs. Langdon sent for her and took her measure for a new dress, and told her that she was to be one of the guests. Such a lovely dress as it was to be, too - white     80    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. alpaca trimmed with blue silk. Only the rem- nants of an old evening dress of Mrs. Langdon's, yet Janet had never before imagined anything more magnificent. "One of Ruth's ridiculous whims," Miss Rachel said, "and quite calculated, too, to imbue Janet with false ideas of her station, and make her dis- contented with the work-a-day life that must of necessity follow." Even Mr. Langdon said, "It would be like holding a cup to her lips, and then snatching it away after the first sip of the intoxicating draught." Grace resented it quietly, yet firmly; but Bes- sie entertained the idea with unmixed delight. "It's good and sweet of you, sister Ruthie, and Janet and I will love you always for it," she said. Janet went about like one in a dream, and tried to think how it would seem to be dressed ele- gantly, just once in her life. It was utterly use- less to assure herself; in a little corner of her heart, that dress was nothing, as she had been told so often. She felt it to be everything, at least everything in the eyes of others. If she could only be dressed she felt that she could be sure of respect, consideration and happiness.   GRACE MOWBRAr'S PARTr.      81 Mrs. Langdon gave her a pair of pretty, blue slippers to match the trimming on her dress, and when her hair was curled and she was all ready to go below stairs on the night of the party, she really looked very pretty. What a thrill of delight she felt as she took a last look at herself in the glass before going down, and then turned to leave the room with Bessie! No more faded, shabby dresses, -surely she was nnexceptionable now, in her appearance, she thought, walking off with triumphant assurance. "Dear me, Janet," said Grace, who had stood watching her critically. What a walk you have. Do turn your toes out and hold your shoulders back, and don't stick out your elbows." This was a new idea to Janet! There was something then, even in appearance, that was not wholly dependent upon dress. There was a way of holding oneself that meant somlethig. What measured steps she took after this, and how constrained and precise her whole bearing became. So very precise, indeed, as to be ludi- crous had it not been pitiful. "What makes that girl walk and act so stiff?" asked one of the youthful guests, regarding Janet with a look of pained curiosity. 4*     82    HEIGHTS AND DEPTH i "Room-a-tism," explained Dick Wilder, a mi s chievous boy, who was the terror of old maids and timid little girls. "Janet darling," said Bessie kindly, as she took her aside a moment, "don't walk so stiff and act so precise. Sister Ruth always tells me not to think of myself or how I look, or imagine anyone is looking at me, but always look at others and be interested in what they are doing, and not think of myself at all except to help others enjoy them- selves. Now don't think of yourself, Janet. You see there are so many here that no one will look at you more than the rest, unless you do some- thing different from all the rest." How plain and simple the rule sounded, -just to think of others and be interested in what they were doing and forget herself. Janet thought she could do that. She was doing it beautifully. She became so interested in the fairy-like costumes and graceful, flitting forms about her that she had quite forgotten her- self, when Grace came up, and, with a pretext of tying her sash, said, in a cutting whisper, "How you do stare at everything, Janet! And with your mouth half open, too, as if you never saw   GRACE MO WBRA 'S PARTr.     83 anything before. Everybody is looking at you, and I am quite ashamed of you." A white look of terror and mortification over- spread Janet's face, and she was depressed and miserable the remainder of the evening. Her gay costume, in which she had taken so much pleasure, became, all at once, conspicuously tormenting. Was it true that everybody was looking at her? Was the short boy, in white pants and blue jacket, looking, and was it partly disgust and con- tempt that made his nose turn up so frightfully  Was the cross-eyed boy, in black velvet, look- ing, and did his eyes roll about in his head at such a rate to find a place to look where Janet wasn't? Was the tall, thn boy, with sharp eyes and a long nose, who wore an elegant watch and chain, looking at her? And did he keep twirling his watch-chain, and pretend to look at other girls to prevent her from seeing how very hard it was for him to keep from laughing outright at her awk- wardness? Were the girls all looking, too, out of the cor- ners of their eyes and from behind their fans? And was that what made them whisper and laugh and nod at one another, and go whirling about     84    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. from place to place like gaily decorated spinning- tops? And oh, worst of all, was dear, darling Bessie looking, while she seemed so engrossed, helping to entertain the guests, and making little trips every now and then to Janet to comfort and en- courage her? Were Bessie's smiles and nods of approval only sweet little make-believes, and was she in reality ashamed, too, of Janet, and sorry she had been invited? The thought was too teriible! After all, how little dress alone could do? Janet had never before realized it. In the midst of her wretchedness Mrs. Langdon came in and introduced some merry, romping games, that the children seemed to enjoy im- mensely, but Janet had never played any of these games, and the idea of attempting to participate, and thus render herself more conspicuous and ridiculous, was too dreadful to be thought of, so she stood aloof, while one after another asked her if she were ill, or offended, or what was the mat- ter that she did not join them? Could anything be more wretched?  Janet thought nothing ever could be! If ahything   GRACE MOWBRAT'S PARTr.     85 could be, it was when supper was announced; for then fresh difficulties began. "Shall I bring you a lemon ice?" asked the boy who had taken Janet out to supper. "Yes," she answered, without the slightest idea of what he meant. "What will you have with it?" he asked, try- ing to be gallant and mature. "I think, I think--a cup of coffee, if you please," stammered Janet. "A cup of coffee? Anything else 2" asked the boy, smiling wickedly. "Nothing else," said Janet miserably. C"Lemon ice and a cup of coffee; she's a queer duck," said the boy to a comrade, as he went to execute Janet's order. "A duck," said the other; "I should call her a chicken, judging from the gaps she has been hav- ing." Bessie came up just in time to hear this, and to realize that Janet would soon be a laughing-stock, perhaps nicknamed "Lemon ice and coffee." In an instant Bessie was beside Janet and say- ing, "Now, Janet, I am going to pretend that we have a secret, and you must not contradict any- thing I say. Let me manage it all."     86    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS Janet acquiesced, and when her order was served, Bessie said quickly, "Now, Mr. Roberts, you may bring me a lemon ice and a cup of coffee. It is a trick Janet and I have. We can't tell you what it means now, but we will tell you some- time. We must have this first, and afterwards we can have anything to eat we please." Very soon it came to be whispered about that Bessie Mowhray had a secret, something about a lemon ice and coffee, and instead of Janet's being a laughing-stock, she became an object of interest as the sharer of Bessie's secret. Bessie took occasion, at the earliest opportunity, to seek Mrs. Langdon, and explain matters to her, and say, "Oh, Ruthie, do help me, for I can't think what kind of a trick to tell them it is; for we must have something to tell them, as of course the trick must be found out at the last or there will be no fun in it." "Well," said Mrs. Langdon, "you must excite every one's curiosity to the highest pitch, and make them guess everything, and just before they go home tell them it was a trick to excite their curiosity." "Oh, that will be capital," exclaimed Bessie, clapping her hands, and away she flew to' become   GRACS MOWBRAr'S PARTr      87 more lovely and mysterious than ever, and to drive the boys and girls half wild with curiosity to find out what the trick could be. When it was announced that the trick would be declared at the last moment before the guests went home, not a few began to be anxious for the hour to arrive. "And after all it was only a trick to excite our curiosity," said one, a trifle disappointed. "Anyhow, it was well done," spoke up another, "for everybody had his curiosity excited, and I think it brightened things up wonderfully." Janet, of all the little throng of merry-makers, had found the evening prolonged humiliation and disappointment. It was a long time before she could sleep, and even then she was tormented by a dreadful dream of the tall boy, with sharp eyes and a long nose, who, she dreamed, picked her up by her blue sash and held her out at arm's length, where every one could look at her, and screamed, "A trick! oh, yes, a nice trick to hide how green you are!. How green you are  Never ate a lemon ice before!" Janet waked in a cold terror and fright, and the gray morning was just creeping through the win-     88    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS, dow, in a pallid, miserable way that seemed quite to sympathize with her wretchedness! "Nrow, girls," said Mrs. Langdon, after break- fast that morning, "you may tell me how you enjoyed yourselves last night. Grace is the oldest, so she may speak first." "Well, if I must tell the precise truth, I did not enjoy myself very much. My hair came out of curl before the evening was half over, and Lily Benton kept boasting that hers curls naturally. That girl always manages to have something better than I have, and she is so pert and disagreeable about it, too," said Grace discontentedly. "And you, Bessie; was the evening pleasant to you?" asked Mrs. Langdon, after listening at- tentively to Grace. "Oh, it was lovely," exclaimed Bessie, with en- thusiasm; "I was never happier." "I don't see how you managed to enjoy your- self so much," said Grace wonderingly. "Oh, I didn't have to manage to enjoy myself. The girls all looked so pretty, and the boys were so funny, and everything seemed so gay and bright that I couldn't help enjoying myself," rejoined Bessie, all aglow with remembrance!   GRACEJ MOWBRA 'S PARTT.     89 "And you, Janet What kind of a time had you?" asked Mrs. Langdon kindly. Janet blushed and hung her head, and waa utterly unable to make any reply. "Everything was so new and strange to her, you know," explained Bessie sympathetically. "Yes, there must always be some reason for our not being happy, and we should try to think what it is," began Mrs. Langdon; "Grace was not happy because she opened the door of her heart to two little twin-demons, who generally go hand in hand, and they kept tormenting her the whole evening." "Two little twin-demons," exclaimed Grace, flushing with surprise and indignation. "Yes, Grace, and their names are Vanity and Envy. Vanity told you that your hair was getting out of curl, and that you were not looking as well as you might look, while Envy told you how much better Lily Benton was looking, and made you feel as if she was attracting more admiration than yourself, and so made you anxious to see some- thing disagreeable about her. The more lovely she appeared, the more unhappy you became, for the reason that Vanity made you think of your- self all the time and made you want every one to     90    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. admire you more than any other. It is not what others do or what others have that can make us envious unless Vanity keeps us thinking too much about ourselves." "I'm sure, sister Ruth, I don't care what Lily Benton has, but I do think she is pert and dis- agreeable," said Grace, with a little flush of anger. "You think so because she attracted more admiration than yourself. She is disagreeable to you because she appears to better advantage, and so hurts your vanity, that is greedy and wants all the praise. You must try to conquer these demons, Gracie. To conquer your vanity you must quit thinking so much about yourself. Don't be so eager for praise. It is the most unreliable thing in the world; since the very persons who praise you extravagantly to-day may, for some real or imaginary slight, censure you as much to- morrow as they have praised you to-day. And even if you could attract as much admiration as you desire, there must always be some envious persons who will feel cheated of their share of prAise and so endeavor to disparage you. They would say of you, as you say of Lily Benton, 'With all her pretty dresses, or graceful bearing, or witty speeches, Grace Mowhray is pert and   GRACE MO WBRAT'S PARTT.     91 disagreeable.' Envy and detraction always shad- ow the footsteps of success. We can not have unmixed pleasure any more than we can have sunshine without shadow. Those who are most admired are most envied. and hated and calum- niated. While if you escape envy and evil- speaking you are held in contempt as being a good sort of person, with not much to you any way." "Then I don't see what a person is to do," said Grace unhappily. "Do right," rejoined Mrs. Langdon. "Bessie was happy last night because she did not think of herself. She was glad to see the girls looking so pretty, and delighted to have the boys witty and funny, and so rejoicing in the happiness of others, she found perpetual delight. That is why the angels are happy, because they delight to do good and to bring happiness to others. When we can love our neighbor as ourselves, we can enjoy his happiness with him. It is loving self, and strug- gling to get and keep all for self that makes Hell. That is why demons are so unhappy. Each tries to keep every one from being any happier than he is; each is envious and selfish and perpetually     92    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. struggling to torment others, and so there is un- ceasing discord and misery. Tears glistened in Janet's eyes as she began to understand what Hell means. "And you, Janet," said Mrs. Langdon kindly, "did not enjoy yourself because everything was so new and strange to you. You could not par- ticipate in the games because you did not under- stand them; you had never played them, and so could not do what the others found so much plea- sure in doing. Shall I tell you the lesson that this teaches 2" The girls looked up with increased interest, and said "Yes, with one accord. "It teaches that we must be fitted for a thing before we can enjoy it; and for this reason we live our life on earth before we can go to Heaven. We are put here first that we may learn the things that will enable us to be happy in Heaven. Our souls must learn the beautiful walk of the angels, or when we go among them we shall feel awkward and out of place, just as one feels who is placed for the first time in refined society, and is utterly at a loss to know what to do and what not to-do. If we would be happy in Heaven, we must learn on earth to be like the angels; we   GRACE MOWBRAr'S PARTr.      93 must do as they do, and then when we go among them we shall feel at home and shall be welcomed as one of them. First we must learn to care more for making others comfortable and happy than for seeking our own selfish pleasure. We mues learn to do what is best to be done, and not what we feel most like doing. "If we spend our earthly lives in seeking only our own comfort and convenience, we shall foster in ourselves an ease-loving spirit that will forever repel from us all affectionate companionship. Good spirits will not love to be near us because we shall be unlike them; while even selfish per- sons will dislike and avoid us, for they will know that we care too much for ourselves to help them to be selfish and greedy. So you see that while God wants us to be happy, and tries to make us happy by attaching penalties to all our sins, we can not be happy unless we pursue the only road that there is to happiness." "Sister Ruth," said Bessie, lifting up her sweet face that shone like a fresh morning-glory in the early sunshine, "you said Janet could not enjoy herself last night because she did not understand the games we played; and you said we must learn on earth to do as the angels do in Heaven, if we     "    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. want to feel at home with them and happy with them. What do the angels do?" "We can not know certainly, Bessie, but I think we mayr form an idea. I can tell you what I believe they do, and what there is good reason for supposing that they do. "I believe that as they are God's ministering spirits, they are constantly employed in doing His work, which is to teach and help and comfort and uplift His creatures everywhere. They can see the growth of a soul as we can see the growth of a plant, and when our souls are becoming dry and withered from the sunshine of too much prosperity, they give us rains of tears, and though we can not see how, these tears water the roots of our souls, and make them strike deeper and grow broader, and become more hardy and enduring, and strong enough to bear the weight of happiness we shall find in Heaven. "By constantly doing God's work these angels see more and more of His love and wisdom, and the wonderful manner in which He deals with souls, and so they love Him more and more, and become happy in proportion as they love him; for the love of God makes happiness in our own   GRACE MO   R WBRA r'S PARTr.  95 hearts, just as the sunshine makes the beautiful color of the flowers." "But suppose we do not love God very much, or, at least, do not think about Him very much, how can we learn to love Him?" asked Grace thoughtfully. "By doing what He has commanded us to do. By living to make others happy, and thinking more of others than ourselves. We learn to love God by obeying Him, since the more we tread His paths the more we see of His goodness and mercy, and when we once realize how great His love for us, and how wonderful His care of us, we can not help loving Him." Mrs. Langdon said she had not time to talk any more just then, as she had houselold duties demanding her attention. "And now," she said, ' you must not sit idly dreaming of what I have said; you must each occupy yourself with some useful occupation. I have some coarse tow- els that Bessie and Janet may hem for me; while Grace may see that the parlors are in order, and set the table for dinner." Mrs. Langdon had great faith in the power of useful employment to make persons good and happy.     96    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. "Nothing to do," she contended, "is the root of more evil than the love of money." Nothing to do fosters pride, vanity, selfishness, and all manner of noxious spiritual plants, whose breath is pestilence and whose work is Death I I   CHAPTER V. THE LEVEL GROUND OF REALIZATION. RACE and BeSsie -were going back to school, and the morning of their depar- ture Janet felt almost as if the world were coming to an end. She could not imagine what there would be to do or say without Bessie- merry, loving, busy Bessie -who was always so full of fun and frolic, and yet so brave and unselfish and full of consid- eration for others. Don't feel so badly, Janet dear," said Bessie, trying to comfort her; "You know we can write to each other, and that will be almost the same as talking, for I'll write you everything that happena at school, or at least as much as I can find time to write, and you must write me all about everything at home." 5     98    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. Janet promised, and, for a moment, felt almost resigned to the separation. It was only for a moment that she could feel so, and then her grief seemed to increase ten-fold, and she sobbed uncontrollably. "How strange it is for Janet to cry so," said Grace contemptuously. "One would think she had known us always instead of only a few weeks." "Good-bye, Janet dear," said Bessie, kissing her fondly. "Good-bye, Janet," said Grace coldly, without noticing Janet's outstretched hands. "Why, didn't you shake hands with her, Grace; it wouldn't have hurt you, would it?" asked Bes- sie, when the door had closed and the two had fairly started. "Yes, it would have hurt me. I didn't want to shake hands with her. I don't like Janet, and I won't be deceitful," rejoined Grace, with an air of deserving a great deal of credit for not being deceitful. "Sister Ruth says we must have very wicked hearts when we feel so badly toward persons that we can't be kind to them without being deceitful. You needn't be deceitful, but she says we ought to be ashamed of ourselves when kindness is   "EVEL GROUND OF REALIZATION. 99 deceit. We ought to be ashamed of ourselves when we don't feel kind enough towards people to try to make them happy; and we ought never to pride ourselves upon not being deceitful because we are acting out hatefulness. Janet has no home, and the same as no father and mother, and sister Ruth says we ought to do everything in our power to make her happy. If you don't like her you ought to be all the more careful that you do not wound her by showing your dislike," said Bessie. "Dear me, how tiresome you are, Bessie 1 Be- sides, it is very conceited of you to imagine that you are capable of telling me what to do. Don't talk any more, please; my head aches," replied Grace. Meantime Janet was having her trials. Overcome with grief at Bessie's departure, she had thrown herself into a chair by the parlor win- dow, whither she had gone to have a last look at the carriage that took Bessie out of her sight, and there she sat sobbing to herself when Miss Rachel, passing through the hall, caught a glimpse of her, and exclaimed indignantly, "The idea of Janet's sitting up in state to indulge her grief! In the parlor, too! Could anything be more absurd?"     100    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. Janet started to her feet, and mortification made her for the time oblivious of her grief. "Come, come," said Miss Rachel; "You must go to doing something. We can't any of us expect to eat the bread of idleness. Those who eat must work." Janet said "Yes'm," meekly, and followed Miss Rachel up-stairs to find something to do. First there was Mrs. Langdon'a room to put in order. Janet loved to do anything for Mrs. Lang- don, and would have found relief in the light task assigned her, if Miss Rachel had not pursued her with such remarks as: "You ought to be glad and grateful to do anything you can after Mrs. Langdon has been so kind to you." "I am," rejoined Janet; "I love to do anything for Mrs. Langdon." "' Oh, well, actions speak louder than words, and it isn't the way to show your gratitude to sit up in the parlor and do nothing. You ought to be always watching and thinking what you can do for Mrs. Langdon. She has been very kind to you; making clothes for you and doing so much. It isn't every little girl that has so much done for her. Don't you know that?" Janet said "Yes'm," again, but this time a little   "EVEL GROUND OF REALIZATION. 101 sulkily. Miss Rachel had such a way of remind- ing her of her indebtedness to Mrs. Langdon, and of supposing that she was not grateful when she was grateful, that it sometimes seemed more than she could bear. Don't be so slow," said Miss Rachel. "You wouldn't earn the salt that goes in your bread at that rate, How do you expect to live if you don't work? Come, hurry! You won't get through to day." Janet had become quite nervous by this time, and endeavoring to wash and wipe the soap-dish quickly, she forgot to be careful, and it slipped through her fingers and broke. "There!" said Miss Rachel sharply, "You've spoiled the set, -that handsome china set of Mrs. Langdon's, that cost more than you will ever be able to earn. Dear me, dear me, what will she say to you, and she has been so kind to you, too. So careless! I suppose you thought it made no difference whether you were careful or not of other people's things, since they don't cost you anything. Besides, people who have never had anything never know the value of things." "I was careful," broke out Janet impetuously,     102    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. "but you kept hurrying me so and talking to me so I didn't know what I was doing." "There I Take that, and that, for your imperti- nence," and Miss Rachel administered a sound boxing to Janet's ears. "Aunt Rachel, Aunt Rachel!" exclaimed Mrs. Langdon surprised and distressed, coming into the room just in time to witness the chastisement. "You needn't Aunt Rachel me in that kind of style," exclaimed Miss Rachel indignantly. "She was impudent to me, and I won't endurei imperti- nence from any child, much less from a ittle beg- gar like her!" "I'm not a beggar," sobbed Janet; "I never asked anything of you." "I'll box you again if you utter another word in my presence," said Miss Rachel, starting for- ward. "Go down into the dining-room, Janet, and wait until I come down," said Mrs. Langdon. Janet left the room without a word, and, over- come by anger, grief and mortification, sat wait- ing below stairs for Mrs. Langdon at least half an hour before the lady made her appearance. "Now, Janet," said Mrs. Langdon gravely, "I   "EVEL GROUND OF REALIZATION. 103 want you to tell me just how you came to speak disrespectfully to Miss Rachel." I didn't mean to speak disrespectfully. I only told her the truth, that I could not help breaking the soap-dish because she hurried me and talked to me so that I did not know what I was doing, and it slipped through my fingers and broke," explained Janet. "Well, I'm glad you didn't mean it, and I want you to tell Miss Rachel so," said Mrs. Langdon. "She boxed my ears and called me a beggar," rejoined Janet resentfully, " and I'm not a beggar. I'm poor, but I never begged." Janet's tears came thick and fast, and a humiliating sense of helplessness well-nigh overpowered her. "Our Saviour' was so poor that he had not where to lay His head," said Mrs. Langdon softly. "She boxed my ears, and for nothing, too," repeated Janet unforgivingly. Mrs. Langdon was silent for a few moments, and then she asked softly, Do you remember Christ's prayer for His persecutors, after they had beaten and buffeted Him, and spit upon Him, and at last nailed Him to the cross? He prayed: 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."'     104    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. Janet's face softened and flushed, and her head drooped lower with the new thoughts that came to her. "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do;"Mrs. Langdon repeated the words once again, then she added, "I think, Janet, persons know not what they do when they do wrong. They do not realize how certainly all wrong- doing is punished, and how terrible the conse- quences of persisting in wrong-doing. Instead of feeling angry or vindictive towards those who injure or offend us, we should pity them for the sorrow that sooner or later must come to all them that work iniquity. Those who are unkind or unjust to us, foster in themselves a spirit of evil that will torture them long after we have forgiven and forgotten them. Moreover, Janet, we can not really punish others for what they have done. If we attempt to do so we injure ourselves more than we can hurt them. We may hate them and speak evil of them, but after all it is their own hearts that will torture or sustain them. If they are right, they will ultimately triumph; while if they are wrong their punishment will be greater than we know how to inflict, and more certain than it is possible for us to execute."   "EVEL GROUND OF REALIZATION. 105 Janet sat very still, and her face showed that she was thinking. At last she said, "I will tell Miss Rachel that I did not intend to speak disre- spectfully to her; but really and truly I think she was the most to blame." "It iS not your place to decide, Janet, who was most to blame. Never mind what others do; look at your own conduct, and be sure that you are right in every particular, and leave the wrong- doing of others to God and their own souls. You are not responsible for what Miss Rachel does, so you need not trouble yourself with thinking of it; but if you intended no disrespect to her, tell her so politely and kindly, and try to feel pleasantly towards her. No matter what you think she has done wrong, remember that if you dislike her and cherish angry feelings toward her on account of it, then you will be doing wrong and will be just as bad as you think she is." Janet's resentment was all gone; and she went up stairs to Miss Rachel, and said, "I didn't intend to speak disrespectfully to you this morn- ing. I'm sorry that you thought I did." Miss Rachel made no reply for a moment, but looked at Janet in a stony, implacable way that was very irritating. 5*     106    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS, "Well," she said at length, incredulously, "I shall believe that you are sorry when I see that you are trying to do better. Actions speak louder than words." Janet's face flushed and paled with suvppressed excitement, and she turned quickly and left the room lest she should be betrayed into saying something that it were better to have left unsaid. "How mean and hateful she is; I despise her," said Janet to herself, as she re-entered the dining- room where Mrs. Langdon sat. "Well, Janet, did you see Miss Rachel?" asked the lady pleasantly. Janet's face was clouded and sullen as she answered, "Yes, ma'am, and I told her I was sorry that she thought I spoke disrespectfully to her; but I don't think she cared about my being sorry for she said she should believe it when she could see that I acted better. She says actions speak louder than words." "Yes, Janet, actions speak louder than words; and you must try to show always by your conduct that you are trying to do as well, at least, as you say that you want to do." Mrs. Langdon told Janet it was time to set the   "EVEL GROUND OF REALIZATION. 107 table for dinner, and then she left the room to attend to other duties; for she was never idle. Left alone to perform the task that had been assigned to her, Janet could not help from think- ing of Miss Rachel. "Boxed my ears and called me a beggar," she said to herself, " and then when I told her I was sorry that she even thought I meant to be imper- tinent to her, she looked at me in such a cold, mean way. It isn't the first time, either. She is always trying to make me feel badly, and always saying how good Mrs. Langdon is to me ; just as if I didn't know that, and .just as if I owed her anything for what Mrs. Langdon does. She tor- ments me all the time, and I don't believe that she will ever be punished for it. I can't believe that God will remember it, and ask her why she treated me so. It's very well for her to call me a beggar and make me feel so wretched, when she has everything she wants and don't know how it feels to be so poor and miserable. I wish she could feel as I do for one day; just for one day. She ought to be punished. She ought to feel badly, she's so mean." These were the thoughts that came to Janet as she was setting the table, and as slho talkevd to     108    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. herself in a low muttering tone, she seemed to be scolding the dishes. ' So hateful," she said, as she put the plates on the table, and gave the one she put at Miss Ra. chels place a savage push as if it were Miss Ra- chel herelf. Janet was very unhappy; for nothing makes one more uncomfortable than angry thoughts. And, as if to make it worse, Miss Rachel came down to dinner looking so bright and comfortable. "I've been thinking, Ruth," she said to Mrs. Langdon, with an air of being quite satisfied with everything, " it will be time to expect a letter from Jane to-morrow or the day after, and if she is going to be at home, so that I can make her a visit, I shall have a very pleasant time." "Yes," said Mrs. Langdon, "I think we may expect a letter to-morrow or the day after." "Everything is so pleasant at Jane's," said Miss Rachel, in quite a glow of anticipation. "The house is so conveniently arranged, and they never keep less than two servants; and I'm sure they set as good a table as one could ever wish. Jane didwell when she married Mr. Foster, for he gives her everything that heart could wish. It is worth one's while to be in such a house."   "EVEL GROUND OF REALIZATION. 109 Mr. Langdon looked up irritated and annoyed. Miss Rachel had such a way of telling what others had, and how much more pleasant everything was some other place than where she happened to be. Mr. Langdon was a kind-hearted but a very quick-tempered man, and his patience becoming quite exhausted at Miss Rachel's incessant refer- ence to luxuries and comforts that he could not afford, he said, at length, "It must be very plea- sant at such a house. I can't imagine how you can ever persuade yourself to leave such a para- dise." Miss Rachel understood the hint, and replied sharply, "I couldn't, only I wanted to see Ruth and the children, and I know Ruth has so many cares that it really seems a charity to visit her now and then, and help her out with her troubles; but it is perfectly delightful at Jane's, for, in addi- tion to everything else, Mr. Foster is such a gen- tleman, so polite and well-bred. He shows his bringing-up by being always so pleasant and cour- teous. That is really a wonderful family. In all the times I have been there I never heard a loud or angry word. They are all so even-tempered and well-bred." "So delightful they must be," said Mr. Lang-     "O    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. don satirically. "I don't see how you can endure the separation. You must be very anxious to be with them; and, of course, they must want very much to see you." "At any rate, they always welcomed me warmly and treated me kindly while 1 was with them, and I don't doubt would be very glad to see me now," rejoined Miss Rachel, tossing her head with offended dignity. No one made any reply to this, and the silence seemed to exasperate her. Nothing irritated her so much as what she termed " being treated with silent contempt." She endured it as long as she could, and then she said abruptly, "I detest these people who are always giving hints. If you are tired of my being here, why don't you say so at once and have done with it, and not beat about the bush with cowardly hints of how glad other people would be to see me. Yodu need not trouble yourself, Mr. Lang- don, about me. I shall leave your house as soon as I can hear from Jane. You have treated me shamefully." "Miss Rachel!"Mr. Langdon sprang to his feet, and the flush of uncontrollable passion rose to his face. He evidently meant to say something   "E EL CGOUND OF REALIZA TION. 1" very plain to Miss Rachel, for his patience was quite exhausted. "My love," said Mrs. Langdon softly, going around to her husband and putting her hand on his arm to restrain him; "For my sake don't get excited!" "Oh, let him speak out! It's just as well; I can bear it," said Miss Rachel, trying to look very resigned. "If you must have it then," said Mr. Langdon, "I was going to say that I should be the last per- son to wish to keep you away from so agreeable a family as you represent the Fosters to be. More- over, you need not imagine my wife's cares to be so great as to demand your assistance. We have no desire to impose upon your good nature by keeping you here when you might be enjoying yourself so much better with the Fosters." "It's no more than I might have expected from you," said Miss Rachel, breaking down in tears. "It's the same as ordering me out of the house. And after all my kindness to Ruth. Some people have no gratitude." Mrs. Langdon looked very much distressed, but before she could say anything Miss Rachel had left the room.     "2    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. Her face was so full of mortification and some- thing like loneliness, as she closed the door after her, that Janet was half appeased. "There is so much allowance to be made tor Aunt Rachel," said Mrs. Langdon to her husband. "She is not very well, and then she is so peculiar that one must not notice everything she says; it is only a way she has." "And a most disagreeable way. I wish from my heart that she would leave the house. She seems always trying to make you discontented by constantly telling you how much better things are somewhere else, and she never seems to be satis- fied with anything that is done for her. She tries my patience sorely, and I really can not endure having her in the house a great while longer." "Let us try to be as patient as possible," re- joined Mrs. Langdon. "You know her income is small, too small to keep her comfortably unless her friends are considerate and do for her out of kindness what she has not the money to purchase." "Why, then, can't she act with more discre- tion?" asked Mr. Langdon impatiently. "It is her peculiar disposition, I think," said Mrs. Langdon; "and sometimes I really believe   "EVEL GROUND OF REALIZATION. 113 she can not help it. She does not seem to realize that she is making herself disagreeable." "Then it is time she did realize it. She has been humored in her selfishness until she is posi- tively intolerable." "Well, my dear," rejoined Mrs. Langdon sooth- ingly, "You know she has no other place but this. She lives more peaceably here than any other place that I have ever known of her living, and I really don't see how we can turn her out of doors." "Ruth," said Mr. Langdon decidedly; "One thing is certain; your Aunt Rachel can not live with us. She irritates me constantly, and she must leave here. There is no use of mincing matters. I mean just what I say; she must leave here, and if you will not tell her so, I must. That is all." "Well, don't worry, dear; I will try to arrange it," rejoined Mrs. Langdon, as her husband took his hat and left the house. Janet could not resist the temptation to follow Mrs. Langdon up-stairs to Miss Rachel's room-- she was so curious to know what would come next. "Charlie is so busy now that he comes home quite exhausted, and fatigue makes him nervous     "4    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. and a little irritable sometimes, I'm afraid," began Mrs. Langdon to Miss Rachel, who sat rocking to and fro in a way peculiar to herself. "I hope you didn't feel hurt at anything he said at the dinner- table, Aunt Rachel." "Oh, I suppose it is no more than I could expect. I've no one to protect me -no husband or brother to fight my battles - and I suppose Mr. Langdon feels it quite safe to insult me in every possible way," rejoined Miss Rachel. "I am sure he did not mean to insult you, Aunt Rachel; but the fact is, he has been a little unfor- tunate lately in some speculations of his, and too frequent allusions to the comforts and conve- niences that others have and that we have not, I think irritate him, and he can not always control himself." "Oh, well," said Miss Rachel with a toss of her head, "if I am never to speak of anything com- fortable that others have, without making him envious and cross, the sooner I am out of the house the better." "I wish things were different," said Mrs. Lang- don, " but as they are, perhaps you would be more comfortable somewhere else." This proposition seemed to irritate Miss Rachel   "EVEL GROUND OF REALIZATION. 115 very much, and she went on to say how very strange it was that persons can be so constituted as to have no gratitude. She recounted the times that she had been of service to Mrs. Langdon when there was sickness in the family, and how with her own pocket money she had purchased delica- cies such as sick people so much enjoy. In fact, so numerous were the favors which she recited that Janet, quite overcome by the weight of obligations mentioned, hastened to seek Lizzie, that she might find a solution of Miss Rachel's unpopularity. "If she has done so much for Mr. and Mrs. Langdon, I should think they would like her and be very glad to have her in the house," said Janet. "So they would," rejoined Lizzie, " only that when Miss Rachel does a kindness she expects people to be thinking of it and be all the time grateful for it, and if they seem to neglect her or to disapprove of anything she does, she begins to tell them of all she has done for them, and how ungrateful they are not to remember it; and so I suppose they would rather do without her favors than to be so constantly told of them." Janet began to understand how it is after all the disposition that one cultivates that will bring hap-     "6    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. piness or misery. She began, too, to realize that persons who wrong or irritate us are very sure to wrong or irritate some one else, and sooner or later will be punished for so doing. Pity for Miss Rachel gradually took the place of her resentment, and she was no longer afraid that God would forget to punish any wrong-doing; for she was beginning to realize that people who do wrong are punished every day and all the time by the consequences of their misdeeds. It is not that God wants to torment us for disobey- ing Him; it is that we can not do wrong without suffering for it, any more than we can put our hand in the fire without being burned and feeling pain therefrom. We can not always understand how suffering is to follow sin, yet we know that it is our state of mind that makes us happy or unhappy, and wrong-doing, persisted in, will put us in such a state of mind as will forbid our being happy. It is the same way with our bodily condition; for there are laws that govern the well-being of our bodies as well as laws that govern the well- being of our souls. For example, if we persist in eating unwholesome food, or in eating too much or too little, we shall, after a time, so derange out   "EVEL GROUND OF REALIZATION. 117 stomachs that we can not enjoy our food. The pleasure of eating will be destroyed, and so we are punished for not having eaten properly and moderately. In other ways also may we injure our health until we become confirmed invalids, and suffer innumerable aches and pains as a consequence of not having properly observed the laws of health. It is even so with our sins. If we indulge any evil tendency it will grow in us until our natures become more and more evil, and losing the power to enjoy that which is good we become morally so diseased that we shall have in eternity only the aches and pains of comfortless and unprofitable sin. A dim perception of this, in a crude way, made Janet feel more kindly towards Miss Rachel and less disposed to consider her own grievances. She was amply repaid for any self-sacrifice that she endured, by receiving a few days afterwards a letter from Bessie. Janet had never before received a letter, and this seemed for a moment the most wonderful event of her life. It was written in a round, precise hand, that     "8    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. Janet thought must have cost impatient, fun-loving Bessie a world of trouble, and thus it ran: "EVANSTON, Feb. 3. ".My Dearest Janet: "I promised to write to you, and I thought I would do so. I am very well, and hope you are the same.  Grace is writing a letter to Aunt Rachel, and I thought I would write to you. "My desk-mate's name is Estelle Graham. The girls all call her Stella. She in a very nice girl. We are in the same classes. I like her very much. She and I have splendid times at recess and after school hours. "Our teacher's name is Miss Morrison. She is a very good teacher. "How is sister Ruth, and how is the baby? I want so much to see the baby! Is she as fat as ever? Give my love to sister Ruth and Aunt Rachel. "I would write more only I can not think of anything more; as Grace says, 'I haven't words to express it;' besides, Miss Morrison reads all of our letters, and if there are any mistakes in them we have to copy them all over, and if they are so   "EVEL GROUND OF REALIZATION. 119 long it is more trouble to copy them. Write to me soon. "Your affectionate friend, "BESSIE MOWBRAY.) Mrs. Langdon read this aloud to Janet, and afterwards Janet spelled it over by herself until she knew every word of it by heart. Yet, after all, how meagre it seemed when compared to what Bessie would have said. Janet longed to ask a hundred questions, and She thought with a little jealous pang of Bessie's desk-mate, who would of course quite compensate Bessie for the loss of Janet's society. There was a little selfishness in Janet's love, as there is in all our human love, that made this thought a not altogether pleasing one, and Janet spent many hours thinking of this Estelle Gra- ham, and wondering what kind of a girl she could be, and whether Bessie would learn to care more for her than for any one else.     CHAPTER VI. DONALD FOSTER. HE long-expected letter from the Fos- ters, that Miss Rachel had so counted upon, came at last, yet instead of invit- ing her to make the visit that she had anticipated with so much pleasure, it spoke of a trip to be made for Mrs. Foster's health, during which it was probable that the Fosters would make Mrs. Langdon a visit. "Oh, dear," sighed Miss Rachel, " such a bother as they will be, especially if they bring the chil- dren." "Which is scarcely probable," suggested Mrs. Langdon; " If they were Jane's own children she might bring them, but as they are only step-chil- dren I think it quite likely that they will be left at home."   A few weeks after this, however, all specula- tions as to what the Fosters would or would not do, were ended by the arrival of the Fosters them- selves, with the two children whose coming Miss Rachel had so much dreaded. And yet, serious as her apprehensions had been concerning the trouble that they would make, she was genuinely glad to see them. Mr. Foster was a portly, complacent-looking man, somewhere in his forties, who had an air of being exceedingly well-fed, and, as a consequence, quite pleased with himself' and the rest of the world. He had a red face, and a motion about his mouth as if he were about to taste something very good to eat. Mrs. Foster was a small, delicate-featured per- son, with a very lady-like manner, conveying an impression of patient invalidism. She was appa- rently about forty years of age, and as she had been married but a short time, she still retained a look peculiar to many single ladies; an air at once timid, lonely, and yet self-dependent. The children consisted of Nina, a little, blue- eyed creature between three and four years old, and Donald, a boy of fourteen.    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. "Such a care as they must be for you," said Miss Rachel to Mrs. Foster, sympathetically. "Yes, a great care," rejoined Mrs. Foster, who was Miss Rachel's first cousin and not unlike her in many respects. "Nina is scarcely more than a baby and needs looking after all the time, while Donald imagines himself too old to be tied to apron-strings, espe- cially a step-mother's, you know, so with trying to gain an influence over him, and feeling as if I must begin to mold Nina's character, I have, indeed, a great deal of care." Mrs. Foster sighed wearily, and seemed quite overcome with the thought of her duties and responsibilities. Meantime Donald had found his way into the kitchen, and was rapidly making the acquaintance of Janet, who was peeling potatoes for dinner. He began by inquiring about Grace and Bessie, and as Janet never wearied of talking about Bes- sie, she readily answered all the questions that Donald's fertile imagination could suggest. "I don't like Grace so well as I do Bessie," said Donald, in a burst of confidence. "She's too prim and stuck-up, and thinks herself a young lady; but Bessie is a regular brick."   "A what ?" asked Janet wonderingly. "A brick," explained Donald smiling. "That means she's tip-top, jolly, you know. Don't you understand ?" Janet thought she understood, and echoed Bessie's praise warmly. So the conversation went on from one thing to another until Donald told Janet all about himself that he thought worth telling. He told her how his mother died when Nina was a wee, little baby, a few months old, and how the present Mrs. Fos- ter was his mother's cousin,.and was an old maid when she was married, and, Donald thought, " took altogether too much authority for a step- mother." Moreover, Donald gave it as his unbi- assed opinion that women can bring up girls well enough, but-they don't know anything about boys. It was his conviction that "a woman would keep a fellow tied to her apron-strings forever if she could, and never let him have any fun at all." Janet ventured to inquire what Donald consid- ered fun; to which he replied, " Oh, lots of things, skating, hunting, riding, fire-works, and ever so many other things." Janet looked up and caught Donald in the act    124    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. of taking a chew of tobacco, and her astonishment involuntarily expressed itself in the words, "You don't chew tobacco, do you?" Her tone was so unmistakable in its disapproval that Donald flushed a little as he replied, "Some- times I do!" "What makes you a" asked Janet, feeling her admiration of him considerably diminished by the discovery she had made. "Well, the boys taught it to me when I was a little fellow and didn't know any better. But I quit it until father whipped me one day, and made me mad, and I commenced chewing again to spite him. Now I've got in the habit of it, and can't very well break myself." Janet looked very grave, and made no reply, for the reason that she could not decide what would be best to say. "Don't you like to see anyone chew?" asked Donald, after enduring the silence uneasily for some moments. "No," said Janet. "Well, I don't think chewing is as nice as smoking, and I don't chew a great deal! Don't you like to see anyone smoke, either a" persisted Donald.   DONALD FOSTER.      125 "No," rejoined Janet, "I don't like either one. Tobacco always ieminds me of things I don't like to remember."  "What are they?" asked Donald, with newly- awakened curiosity. Janet blushed and hung her head, and made no reply. She had not intended to commit herself so far; and yet, though he stood waiting for her to speak, she remained silent, for how could she confess to one so refined and well-brought-up that she had ever known such people as she had seen at Mrs. Murphy's - drinking, fighting vagabonds, who smoked and chewed, and spent more than half that they earned for whisky and tobacco, while their wives and children were only half- clothea and fed. The sight or smell of tobacco made her think of those wretched days she had spent at Mrs. Murphy's and the miserable people she had seen there. "Well, what are you thinking about?" asked Donald, after he had waited long enough to con- vince himself that Janet would not speak again until she was spoken to. "I was thinking," replied Janet, " that if you     126    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. chew and smoke now, you will chew and smoke when you are a man." "And what if I do?" asked Donald scornfully. "And if you use tobacco, you might drink whisky," said Janet. ;"I needn't if I didn't choose to, but I should if I wanted to," rejoined Donald sturdily. "A great many men do," said Janet, " and they spend all their money for drink, and they become very poor and starve their children, and beat their wives, and get locked up at the police station, and are very wicked and miserable." "Pshaw," exclaimed Donald. "They are noth- ing but loafers. I shouldn't be a loafer. I should be a gentleman, and I should drink like a gentle. mail; champagne and sherry, and genteel liquors, you know." "Don't they make a person drunk?" asked Janet. "Of course, if you drink enough of them," replied Donald. "c Well, when a man is drunk he don't know what he is doing, and you couldn't act like a gen- tleman if you were drunk," said Janet. "Oh, well, I shouldn't drink enough to get   DONALD FOSTER.      127 drunk. There's no need of a man's making a beast of himself, you know," explained Donald. "Yes, but after you began drinking you might get to like it so well that you couldn't stop when you wanted to; besides you might drink enough to make you drunk before you thought about it.) "Bosh," said Donald impatiently. "You don't know anything about it. You're a girl, and girls don't know anything." Janet had finished peeling the potatoes, and she gave them to Lizzie without a word. Her silence affected Donald more than the sharpest retort would have done, and he longed to have her say something that would show that she was not seriously offended with him; for, though his conviction remained unshaken concern- ing the ignorance of girls, he was not quite sure that he had acted wisely in confiding this opinion to Janet. As there were no boys on the premises, it was barely possible that he might be largely dependent upon her for entertainment. Not that she knew anything, of course, but then she might make a good listener when he felt like talking, and might amuse him when he had nothing else to do. These things considered, he decided upon a     128    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. reconciliation that he attempted by exclaiming, in quite a matter-of-course way, "I say, Janet, has Mr. Langdon any dogs? I have a splendid ratter at home!" Janet replied that Mr. Langdon had no dogs, yet she expressed not the slightest curiosity con- cerning Donald's ratter that he had at home, "I say, Janet, a ratter is a good thing to have," persisted Donald, as if determined to call attention to his favorite. Janet made no reply to this, but went into the dining-room to set the table. Donald wandered about from room to room, affecting an indifference that he was very far from feeling. If Janet had been a boy he would have known just how to make friends. He would have got his bat and ball, or taken out his marbles, or talkied bvaut hie pony, or his father's dogs, or the boys with' whom he went to school. He could have said a great many things to a boy that would have interested him, but girls puzzled him, especially Janet, with her sudden assumption of dignity. "I wonder how she came to be here," said Donald to himself, as he stood looking out of the   DONALD FOSTER.       129 dining-room window, and drumming idly against the window-pane. "I suppose she's mad because I told her that girls don't know anything. Well, they don't, that is, anything about what boys ought to do. Girls are so queer anyhow. I shouldn't like her to stay mad all the time I'm here. I guess I'll buy some taffy candy and give her some; girls always like sweet things." Donald turned suddenly around as this project suggested itself, and determined to execute it at once. "Janet," he said, "is there a confectionery anywhere near here?" Janet said there was one in the next block, and Donald crowded his cap down over his eyes, and went out the street door at "a break-neck pace"Miss Rachel said, who saw him from an upper window, and wondered " what mischief that boy could be up to now." Boys were Miss Rachel's especial aversion; so much so that the sight of a cap or a jacket, or a pair of stubby, defiant-looking boots that might belong to a lad anywhere between six and sixteen, quite unstrung her nerves for the day, and added a drop of gall to the experiences of her lifetime. Girls, she thought, were "bad enough," though 6*     130    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. they did sometimes "stay as they were put,' which boys never did. Girls were trying enough to one's temper and patience, yet they did some- time grow to be women, which boys never did. There was some hope of girls but, Miss Rachel thought, none of boys. They grew worse as they grew older, more selfish, more conceited, and altogether less tractable. How anyone could imagine it " worth while " to bring up boys was beyond Miss Rachel's compre- hension. "I should like to know what mischief that boy is up to," she said, raising the window and look- ing after Donald, who went whistling along, with his hands in his pockets, and something about the very cut of his jacket that seemed to Miss Rachel a covert impertinence, which being translated would have been, "Who cares for you It isn't any of your business where I'm going or what I'm going to do." Miss Rachel closed the window with a bang, more than ever convinced that if it be true that boys are a necessary evil, it is equally true that they are more evil than necessary. This view of the case progressed rapidly from a conviction to a grievance when she came down   DONALD FOSTER.      131 half an hour later, to see if dinner was almost ready, and found Donald and Janet peaceably eating taffy candy, and comparing notes of their experiences, utterly oblivious of the small errands and chores awaiting at least one of them. "A great boy like you eating candy and fooling away your time with a little servant girl, instead of reading some good book and improving your self as a boy of your age should do," said Miss Rachel witheringly to Donald, as she took Janet by the arm and gave her a push towards the kitchen, telling her to go and see what was to be done. Donald flushed angrily, and said the most defi- ant thing he could think of, which was, "Oh, you dry up." Miss Rachel was very tall and angular, with a pinched face that looked as if she had been drying up for a long time; yet that afforded her not the slightest reason for receiving Donald's sugges- tion with favor. She fixed upon him what she intended as a piercing glance which had about as little effect on him as could well be imagined. He stared back at her with a look that seemed to question Miss Rachel disagreeably, and made her threaten dread-     132    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. ful things when she could have a talk with his father. "Father don't care what I do, so I let him alone," said Donald, which was perfectly true; as Mr. Foster was one of those parents who never punish a child for doing wrong but only for annoy- ing them. He did not consider that when he permitted his children to be impertinent, or selfish, or unjust to others, he allowed them to form habits that would be not only injurious to them, but would in time react upon himself; since it is the character of the child that will curse or bless the parent, for, as the character is formed by little and by little, every act, thought and word helps to do the work. Mr. Foster, however, was not a thinking man, consequently it did not occur to him that children have souls that must be fed as carefully and sys- tematically as their bodies. All things considered, Donald was not a bad boy, which is to say, his impulses were good, though he had many bad habits that resulted rather from imperfect training than evil tenden- cies. He was too kind-hearted to enjoy giving pain merely for the sake of seeing others suffer, yet his   DONALD FOSTER.      133 temper was unrestrained, and he did not hesitate to resent an insult or avenge an injury. He would hide Miss Rachel's spectacles, when she had been unusually cross to him or Janet, and make the poor old lady a world of trouble finding them, yet he would quite as readily defend a small boy from the assaults of a larger one, or relieve any distress that excited his sympathies. He and Janet became fast friends in a very short time, and as Mrs. Langdon gave Janet a play hour every afternoon, they had many a plea- sant game and merry romp together. There was a little cottage, a block or two from Mrs. Langdon's house, that was surrounded by a large, vacant lot. This lot did not belong to the woman who lived in the cottage, but she had been there so long that she had come to consider it as almost her private property, and resisted firmly any attempt made by neighboring children to con- vert this vacant lot into a play-ground. She was a widow, and her name was Mrs. Dum- merson. Many a battle had she waged with the boys in that vicinity; her favorite weapons being broom- sticks or a panful of hot water, as the case seemed to require.     134    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. The boys in return called her "Old Dummy," threw rocks at her, and were only restrained from doing her bodily injury through fear of the police, whose aid she did not hesitate to invoke when the boys were " too many " for her. These things were told to Donald, and he agreed with the boys that it was " a mean shame " for her to keep them from having the benefit of so admirable a play-ground. "Did any of you fellows ever go and ask her to let you play there?" asked Donald, thinking per- haps proper means had not been used to secure her consent. "It wouldn't be any sort of use. She'd say no in a minute. She's as cross as two sticks," rejoined Tom Rathburn, who always spoke first in a crowd. "Well, I'm going to ask her anyhow; and if she says no, it's all right," said Donald, with a nod of his head that might have meant everything in general or nothing in particular. The boys regarded Donald as a superior being, by reason of his appearing to have plenty of pocket money, with which he did as he pleased. Moreover, he had an independence of manner, and a dashing, good-humored way of doing and   DONALD FOSTER.      135 saying things that they admired very much; accordingly they awaited with not a little curi- osity and impatience the result of Donald's appeal to Mrs. Dummerson. They waited around a corner while he knocked at the cottage door and took off his cap politely, as Mrs. Dummerson answered the summons. "If you please, ma'am, we boys would like to play ball in your vacant lot; there's no other good place around here, and we thought you might be kind enough to let us play awhile in there," said Donald, smiling at Mrs Dummerson with a good- humored deference that quite went to her heart. "Well, I don't mind," she replied. "A boy that speaks so civil wouldn't surely do a body any harm." Donald thanked her warmly, and went off to tell the boys the success of his errand. They were surprised and delighted, and one and all agreed that it would have been better to have asked her permission in the first place, than to have waged the many fatiguing and fruitless battles that had resulted so unpleasantly to all parties. They felt a delicious sense of freedom as they took possession of the play-ground, and realized thal they were not to be pounced upon suddenly     136    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. with a broomstick, and put to flight with hot water and a cry of "Police, police, arrest these young villains." They gave themselves up to the game with a zest that only boys can understand, and were at the height of their enjoyment, when crash went the ball through the cottage window and struck Mrs. Dummerson a blow that made her stagger back a step or two and clutch a chair for support. There are some persons who are irresistibly inclined to laugh when another meets with an accident of this kind, and as the boys crowded up to the cottage window and looked in, some laughed outright. This laughter that sounded so like derision, roused the old lady from the shock of the stunning blow that she had received, and rage, for the moment, conquered her pain. "Clear out, you young villains," she shouted, seizing a pan of warm, greasy dish-water and throwing it on the boys before they could collect their scattered senses sufficiently to make their escape. "Police, police!" she screamed, taking posses- sion of her favorite broomstick and rushing out of   DONALD FOSTER.       137 the cottage in pursuit of the boys, who scampered away as fast as their legs could carry them. "She might have known we didn't mean to strike her," said Donald, pausing for breath, when they had reached a safe place, and taking out his handkerchief to wipe the greasy dish-water from his face and eyes. "Of course she might; but wasn't it fun to see that old ball go slap-bang and knock her end- ways?" exclaimed Tom Rathburn, laughing in spite of the greasy scum that spoiled his new cloth cap. 'And she's got our ball, too," said another regretfully. "She has spoiled my new coat, and inother'll thrash me for it," lamented a small boy, quite overcome by the disastrous results of the morn- ing's amusement. "She'll never let us play ball there any more, that's one thing sure," said a fat boy, with a thick voice and round, full eyes that had a look of being always surprised at any turn affairs might take. "The lot don't belong to her! She hasn't any right to keep us off; and I say it's none of her business," rejoined Tom Rathburn, who had got     138    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. over laughing and was beginning to grow indig- nant. One word brought out another, until the boys wrought themselves into a state of feeling belong- ing to the aggrieved party; and they decided to contest Mrs. Dummerson's claim to the disputed spot, to the extent of their ability. "We can worry her more than she can worry us," said the fat boy, whose name was Joe Bel- lamy, and who seemed to threaten dreadful things with his round staring eyes. "Yes, we can do lots of things to her if she don't let us alone, and we'll tell her so if she fools around us any more," rejoined Tom Rathburn, looking ruefully at the dark, greasy stain on his new cap. "She ought to let us play there if the lot don't belong to her, especially as there's no other good place around here," said Donald, losing sight of Mrs. Dummerson's grievance and thinking only of what he considered his rights. The boys did not for an instant remember that the lot did not belong to them any more than it belonged to Mrs. Dummerson, and that if she had no right to keep them off of it they certainly had no right to insist on taking possession of it.   DONALD FOSTER.      139 For two days after this it rained, and the boys were forced to remain in-doors; the third day, however, rose clear and beautiful, and they betook themselves to " old Dummy's lot," as they. called the coveted play-ground. "All's quiet on the Potomac," shouted Tom Rathburn as he peered round the cottage and saw nothing of the enemy, Mrs. Dmmnerson. "I shouldn't wonder if she'd let us alone after this," said Donald, who, having made up his mind to "fight it out on this line," as he had heard his father say, felt somehow as if Mrs. Dummerson must be conquered from an abject sense of what boys could do and her own helplessness in case they were provoked to the utmost. "Come on boys, there's no fear," he shouted, tossing up a new ball in which he had invested the last of his pocket-money, and which for that rea- son he was all the more determined to enjoy. Inspired by Donald's bravado, the boys cast all fear of consequences to the winds, and became as absorbed in their game and as oblivious of Mrs. Dummerson as if she had been a thousand miles away, and the play-ground theirs by a regularly executed deed of conveyance. All at once there was a cry that made the boys     "O    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. turn horror-stricken, for in the cottage door stood Mrs. Dummerson screaming, "Sic, sic, Touser! At 'em, sir; at 'em!"And a great dog came tear- ing across the common, and before the boys could realize the situation the fierce brute had fastened his teeth in the leg of the nearest boy, who was a pale-faced little fellow, and the most harmless of the crowd. "Oh-h-h, take him off," screamed the child, whose name was Freddie Thompson, and whose face was white with terror and pain. Some of the boys turned and ran away as fast as they could; but others, Donald and Tom Rath- burn and a few more, endeavored by blows and screams to make the dog release his hold. This he did after a time, only to fasten his teeth upon another boy; and there is no knowing how much mischief might have been done had not a police- man appeared and made Mrs. Dummerson call the dog away. The boys got away as best they could; but little Freddie Thompson was so badly hurt that he had to be carried home, and the distress of his mother, who was a poor widow, so wrought upon the sym- pathies of the boys that they vowed vengeance upon "old Dummy," and discussed a system of   DONALD FOSTER.      141 persecution that would have appalled her had she heard them. "We'll make her sick of it," said one. "We'll show her how to set dogs on us," exclaimed another. "We'll give her enough of it," threatened Tom Rathburn with a shake of his head that the boys were very sure meant something dreadful; for "Tom was awful when his spunk was up," they said; "and it would be lively times for 'old Dummy' if he got after her." This confidence in Tom's prowess inspired him to wilder threats and fiercer courage, until he felt pre- pared to do something very desperate. He was not quite sure as yet what it would be, but he told the boys that if they were willing to follow him he'd lead them on to victory or death. The boys were quite ready for victory, yet manifested no enthusi- asm regarding death, though each and all asked "Who's afraid?" and nobody answered "I.' tgo     CHAPTER VII. UIPS AND DOWNS '  IE persecutions that Mrs. Dummerson underwent after this, seemed almost , beyond human endurance. Sometimes one boy would knock at her door, while two, others, stationed at a safe distance, would hurl eggs or mud balls at her when she opened the door to see who had knocked. Again, they watched their chance and threw a large rat on the table where she sat eating her lonely supper. They got in at a window one day when the old lady was from home, and put fire-crackers in her stove, so that when she came to kindle her fire for tea, they would explode and frighten her half out of her senses. They threw rotten eggs against her windows,   UPS AND DO WNS.      143 and carried on so systematic a persecution that the old lady became quite depressed and miserable. She wished a thousand times that she had never attempted to wage war with them, yet she longed incessantly to punish them for their misdeeds. So desperate did matters become that, scanty as her means were, she was forced at length to hire a private policeman to protect her, and not only this, but to find out the exact boys who persecuted her, and arrest them. It so happened that about this time there was, for a few days, a cessation of hostilities. The boys were beginning to weary of assaulting an enemy who no longer resisted or defied them. It is probable that they would have left Mrs. Dummerson alone after this but for a visit that they happened to pay Freddie Thompson as they were passing his mother's cottage one day. "Such a cruel, horrible creature as that Mrs. Dummerson must be," said Mrs. Thompson to the boys, "to set a dog on my poor Freddie, who was never strong, and who has not been well a day since the dog bit him." Mrs. Thompson went on to say what hard work she had to earn a living, and how she had been kept at home with Freddie, when she could have     "4.   HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. been earning her dollar and a half a day going out to wash, if Freddie had been well. These things stimulated the boys to renewed hostility towards Mrs. Dummerson, and as they listened to Mrs. Thompson's story and saw the pale, half-starved look of poor Freddie, they agreed that "Old Dummy" had not been punished half enough. "What are you going to do to her now, Tom?" asked the fat boy, who looked as if he wanted to be surprised more than he ever had been. He seemed always watching for something wonderful to happen as eagerly as a cat might watch for a mouse. "INever you mind," rejoined Tom. "I'll do something worse than we have ever done yet." "What is it?" persisted the fat boy, his eyes growing wider and more eager every moment. "Well, you boys meet me on this corner to-night at eight o'clock, and if I don't tell you something that will be better than anything we've done yet, you may take my head for a foot-ball," said Tom mysteriously, for truth to say he was not quite clear in his own mind as to the precise thing he would do; yet he trusted to his never-failing   UPS AND DO WNS.      145 ingenuity to think up something by the appointed time. Many were the speculations in which the boys indulged concerning Tom's intentions, while a few, Donald among the number, believed that he would back out at the last moment, and perhaps fail altogether to keep the appointment; for truth to say Tom had been known to avail himself of very trivial excuses to account for his failing to do what was expected of him. Persons who boast a great deal are very apt to do this. "Tom Rathburn is always bragging what he will do, and I don't believe he will do anything," said Donald, later in the evening, when he had confided the whole affair to Janet. ' I think he's a bad boy, and I wouldn't go with him, Donald, if I were you," advised Janet. "I don't go with him," explained Donald, somewhat scornfully. "He follows me about. These fellows around here are only the sons of trades-people. If I lived here I shouldn't asso- ciate with them. I only play ball with them because I've no one else to play with, and a fellow can't mope around the house all day." Janehung her head; for if Donald looked down A     "6    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. upon these boys for being the children of trades- people, what would he think of her father, who was only a laboring man? She looked at him wistfully a moment, and a tear stole down her cheek. "What's the matter, Janet?" asked Donald kindly. "I was thinking of my father," said Janet. "What about him?"' queried Donald. "He is poor, and has to drive a team for a living," sobbed Janet. "Oh, well," said Donald, quite abashed, and clearing his throat violently in order to gain time and think what it would be best to say. "You needn't mind that, if he. is a good man. Being poor isn't a disgrace; it is being low, and coarse and vulgar, and not being a gentleman, that is disgraceful. My grandmother says her father was a gentleman, yet at one time he lost his property and had to work for a living; but every one respected him all the same." There was a little tone of patronage in Donald's voice, and Janet felt it rather than understood or reasoned about it. She was silent a moment, and then she said, "Yes, but your grandmother's father has been dead a long time, and nobody   UPS AND DOWNS.      147 knows anything about him now, and people will think more of what you do now than of what he used to do. His being a gentleman won't help you unless you are one." "Of course, only grandmother says children take after their parents, and even after their grandparents, just as apples grow on apple trees and gourds on gourd-vines; so as my great grand- father was a gentleman, it is more probable that I shall be one than if he had been a clodhopper," said Donald. "I think, Donald," said Mrs. Langdon, coming into the room at this moment, and overhearing the last remark, "that you do not quite under- stand these things; but as you have thought of them I will try to explain something about them. It is more probable that a boy whose father is a gentleman will in turn be a gentleman only for this reason, that being surrounded by refining influences he is likely to become refined; yet if a boy spends his time away from his father, who is a gentleman, and seeks the society of coarse and uncultured persons and cultivates vulgar habits of thought, the fact of his father's being a gentle- man will not make him one. "On the other hand, though a boy's father may     "8    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS not be a gentleman, if the boy seek the society of gentlemen, and become imbued with the feelings and thoughts of refined and cultured persons, he may become like them. "You remember the other day I gave you some sweet cakes, and you complained that they tasted of raw coffee, and were, for that reason, not' good! The truth was they had been in the chest with some raw coffee, and were affected by the association. We are all more or less affected by our surroundings and the people with whom we are thrown; for this reason we should avoid the society of those whose purposes are not the purest and best." Janet smiled and her face brightened, but Don- ald, who prided himself upon his pedigree, said sturdily, "Grandmother says there is everything in blood, just as there is in the vegetable kingdom, and that apples don't grow on pumpkin-vines any more than pumpkins or gourds grow on apple trees." "That is quite true, yet scarcely a fair compari- son, since the human race is capable of being improved or deteriorated. Very intelligent per- sons have had idiotic children, and men of genius have sprung from humble parentage. Of course   UPS AND DO WNS.      149 the chances are better where the parentage is favorable; but the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and the proof of a man is in what he does and is, rather than what his father did and was. Of course it is easier for you to be a gentleman if you have a father for an example, than if you have not, yet if you truly aspire to that which is good and true you can be so, irrespective of your father and mother." "What is a gentleman?" asked Janet. "Is it one who wears fine clothes and smokes good tobacco and drinks what Donald calls 'genteel liquors,' and doesn't do any work " "By no means," rejoined Mrs. Langdon with a smile; " that is the vulgar idea of a gentleman. A gentleman is one who scorns anything mean, anything dishonest, anything purely selfish or greedy, or deceitful or coarse. "The essence of everything admirable is uprightness, integrity. "No man can be a gentleman who lives merely for something nice to eat and wear and a pleasant place to sleep. "No man can be a gentleman who is a coward, and so afraid of consequences that he will resort to trickery and low cunning to shield himself from     150    HEIGHTS AND. DEPTHS. the result of anything that he has done or wants to do. ":No man is a gentleman who will persist in doing a thing he is ashamed of, and that he must hide from the world to escape censure. "No man is a gentleman who is greedy and wants more of anything than his share. "No man is a gentleman who prides himself upon his wealth or his position, or upon anything not fairly and honorably earned. "No man is a gentleman who neglects the cul- tivation of his mind, while he stuffs his body with dainties and adorns it with fine linen. "No man is a gentleman who contracts debts which he knows he can not pay, and depends on fair promises and excuse-making to get rid of. "No man is a gentleman who takes advantage of brute force or any superior power to impose upon the weak and helpless. "No man is a gentleman whose object in life is simply a greedy intention to help himself and to enjoy the best, regardless of the wants or wishes of others. "No man is a gentleman who can not forgive an injury or do justice to an enemy. "To be a gentleman means to be noble, to be   UPS AND DOWNS.      151 high-minded, to possess a meek and quiet spirit, and yet to have a lofty and firm determination to uphold, and defend, and practice that which is right through evil and good report. "To be a gentleman is to respect yourself though you wear rags, and to think humbly of yourself though you wear purple and fine linen. "A gentleman does not choose his associates for what others say of them, but for what he knows them to be in their character." Mrs. Langdon paused, and Donald and Janet seemed very thoughtful. They had listened atten- tively, and Donald was wondering if Mrs. Lang- don would think he had not acted the gentleman in his conduct towards Mrs. Dummerson, when suddenly a cry of "Fire! fire!" and a rattling of engines broke the stillness of the night air. Donald seized his cap and rushed out of the street door to see where the fire was. He was horror-stricken to find that it was Mrs. Durnmerson's cottage, and a dreadful suspicion- flashed over him that this was what Tom Rath- burn promised would be worse than had ever been done before to "Old Dummy." Donald's apprehensions were soon confirmed. Tom Rathburn and Joe Bellamy, it seemed, had     152    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. kindled a light fire of shavings in Mrs. Dummer- son's woodshed, with no other purpose than to frighten her, as they imagined it quite possible for her to extinguish the blaze with a bucket or so of water before any damage could be done. The flames, however, made greater headway than they had counted upon, and before they could fully realize what they had done the cottage was in a blaze. Mrs. Dummerson's private policeman got back from his supper just in time to overhear Tom Rathburn and Joe Bellamy discussing the matter, and to take both of them to the station-house for the night; from which place it was more than probable they would be sent to the Reform School. Donald heard these particulars with no little concern, and he felt that he could not be suffi- ciently thankful for the talk with Janet and Mrs. Langdon that had detained him in the house and kept him from the scene of disaster and disgrace. Disaster for poor old Mrs. Dummerson and dis- grace for Tom Rathburn and Joe Bellamy. Donald staid out long enough to learn that Mrs. Dummerson, in great distress, had found refuge for the night in a neighbor's house; and then he   UPS AND DO WNS.      153 retraced his steps to tell the story to Janet and Mrs. Langdon. He was in the mood to confess all he knew of the transaction, and finding Janet and Mrs. Lang- don alone he did so without reserve. "I'm sorry I ever had anything to do with it, but I never thought it would come to this," said Donald, in conclusion. "That's the trouble," rejoined Mrs. Langdon. "We never know what is to be the end of any- thing, but if we do right we need never fear the result. In any event he who does right can not be blamed. He may have disaster, but he will not have disgrace. Do you not see the wisdom of God's command that we should cultivate gen- tleness instead of anger and wrath? "In the first place, when Mrs. Dummerson refused to let you play where you wished, you did not consider that if she had no right to send you away you had no right to stay, since the ground did not belong to you; then when she became angry and drove you away, you retaliated and cultivated among yourselves an angry and vindic- tive spirit that led you to still further disregard the promptings of your better natures, and the result is that Mrs. Dummerson has her house 7     154    HEIGHTS AMND DEPTHS. burned and your companions spend the night at a station-house among thieves and vagabonds and the most degraded characters. "It is most unwise to begin a system of retalia- tion with any one, for the more bitter and vindic- tive you are the more others will dread and avoid you; besides it is only to a certain extent you can go, before the law steps in and takes you into cus- tody as a disgrace and torment rather than bless- ing to the community. "You see, Donald, God understands us better than we do ourselves, and when He commands us not to do a thing, it is because He understands the consequences of so doing; and He tells us not to do these things because He knows that if we do them we shall be unhappy, and He wants us to be happy. "He commands us to love one another because that which is loved is enjoyed; while hatred is a source of unceasing torment. "The difference between Heaven and Hell is only that one is love and the other is hatred. If you love others so that you desire their comfort more than your own, you will think more of making them happy than of making yourself happy, and working for them and forgetting your-   UPS AND DO WNS.      155 self; and making them love you in return, you will be in that blessed, peaceful state that is called Heaven; while if you hate others and try to annoy them and make them uncomfortable, you will be in that hating and tortured state called Hell." "But sometimes you can love a person and want to make them happy, and they won't love you back again; then loving them doesn't make you happy," said Janet, who was thinking that she loved Donald very much, and would do any- thing for him, but that he did not care anything for her, and so made her unhappy. Mrs. Langdon smiled, and said kindly: "We call a great many things love that are not love. Sometimes we think persons have pleasant ways and could do a great many things to please us if they would. We say we love them, but the truth is we love ourselves, and only want them to help us please ourselves, then if they don't want to do this we think we are unhappy because they don't love us, when the truth is we are only unhappy because they don't minister to our self-love./ "We can not truly love persons unless we love them for Christ's sake, and if we do this we shall love God more than we do them; because lie is better than they are. If we love the good in a l     156    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. person, we love that in him which is like God, and as God is all goodness we must love Him more than a nature that is only partly good. "Moreover, if we truly love God we shall trust Him to take care not only of us but of those we love. We shall trust Him to watch over them through good and evil, and to make them happier than we know how to make them." Janet could not understand this exactly. She wanted to be loved for her very own self. She wanted to be made happy as well as make others happy. She could not give up the struggle that was going on in her heart for self. "My little children, shall I tell you of what this reminds me? First, it reminds me of the sailor who complained of the difficulty he found in sav- ing women from drowning, for the reason that they would not remain passive, and allow him to swim ashore with them, which he could easily do, but they insisted upon trying to save themselves in their own way, which was by clinging to him in such a manner as to impede his progress and pre- vent his saving them. "It is even so with our souls; if we try to save ourselves in our own way, and prefer our will to God's will, we forever struggle in the waves of   UPS AND DO WNS.      157 doubt and darkness, and are lost by reason of our self-love that keeps us from being passive in His hands and allowing Him to save us in His own way, lwhich is the only way." Mrs. Langdon had many such talks as this with Donald and Janet afterwards, and her words were as seed sown in good soil, buried out of sight, hid- den deep in the heart, at times apparently forgot- ten in the rush and whirl of every-day life, yet taking root very far down, and destined in due season to bring forth abundantly fruits after their kind. A fortnight passed and the Fosters took their leave. Donald and Janet parted with promises to write, and never, no, never, to forget each other. Then, too, Donald was to come again in vacation, when Bessie and Grace would be at home, which anticipation gave Janet no little happiness! N evertheless, the house seemed very dull to her after the visitors had gone, and she missed Donald in more ways than she could have told. She missed his boyish, teasing pranks, that made keeping a net on or a hair-ribbon tied for any length of time an impossible thing. She missed his snubbing and coaxing, his quick tempers and generous atonements, his boyish boast-     158    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. ing and good-humored patronage, that alternated with moods of genuine repentance of his faults and profound humiliation when convicted of his foibles. Yet for all this Janet was not old enough to be sentimental and pine unduly for any one. She was natural and healthful, and the fact that there were canned peaches for dinner the day after Donald's departure afforded her not a little conso- lation; and at the end of a fortnight Donald's visit seemed like a pleasant dream from which Janet had waked naturally and healthfully, if a little regretfully, to the sharper reality of more enduring experiences. Life settled down, so to speak, in the same old way; which is to say, that after the visitors had gone the temporary restraint that had been placed on the household was removed, and everybody seemed to feel relieved that strangers were no longer by to see things as they were. Mrs- Langdon lost, in a measure, that watchful, anxious look of being responsible for everything and trying to make everything appear to the best advantage, and sacrificing herself in every possi- ble way to secure the comfort and convenience of others.   t PS AND DOWNS.      159 She was as kind and as thoughtful as ever; yet she did not so often force a smile to her lips while her eyes seemed agonized with apprehension lest she should fail to do everything at once. Mr. Langdon, too, was changed, in that he gave expression to his feelings more openly, and instead of the constrained civility and chill courtesy that had veiled his displeasure when strangers were near, he was cross or sulky as the mood seized him. If the steak was over-done or under-done he said outright, "This beef isn't fit to eat!" whereas when the Fosters were present he forced himself to say coldly, "My dear, your cook must be looked after." Miss Rachel's manner also was different. She was less flurried and mysterious, and instead of gloomy hints when anything displeased her, she came out openly and declared herself aggrieved. She and Mr. Langdon disagreed as much as ever, and Mrs Langdon returned to the same old weariness of telling Miss Rachel that Mr. Lang- don " did not mean anything unkind," and assur- ing Mr. Langdon that Miss Rachel had her pecu- liarities, but was really one of the best-hearted women in the world; whereupon Mr. Langdon     160    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. would respond "Stuff and nonsense," and refuse to talk with Mrs. Langdon until she could sym- pathize with his feelings as a wife should. Then, too, Miss Rachel would look at Mrs. Langdon gloomily, and express a willingness to be turned out of the house, since her own sister's child had so little affection for her and allowed Mr. Langdon to treat her so unkindly. Blamed and harassed and appealed to by both parties, a woman less evenly balanced than Mrs. Langdon would have been driven well-nigh to desperation, and there were times when even she was not far from this point. As Spring advanced Mr. Langdon's pecuniary difficulties increased, Mrs. Langdon's health began to fail, and it was decided that they should break up housekeeping and that she should go to visit some of her relatives and recuperate her strength. In the midst of the confusion brought about by this project the question came up, c"What shall be done with Janet?" Her father wag out of work; Lizzie'5 wages would barely suffice for her own clothing, and Janet had arrived at that age when every cir- cumstance seemed to have its influence upon her character to bias her for good or evil.   UPS AND DO WNS.      161 "And yet, after all, Ruth, I do not see why you should take upon yourself an added responsibility in this child. You have already done more for her than you could really afford to do; why not let her father take care of her?" said Mr. Lang- don. "If he only could," responded Mrs. Langdon; "but with his intemperate habits, his unsettled life, and the narrow possibilities of poverty and igno- rance, what can he do? We have only one child,- let us keep Janet. It will be perhaps a little more responsibility, and a little more expense, but it seems to me manifest duty. The child needs a home and needs a mother, and if we try not to avoid any duty that seems to come in our way, I think God will help us and bless us, no matter how arduous it is." "After all," said Mr. Langd6n, " she can be a great help to you with the baby, and so allow you to rest more than you would otherwise be able to do. So, upon the whole, perhaps you had better take her with you." So it was agreed that Janet should accompany Mrs. Langdon, and preparations were commenced at once accordingly. There was the usual amount of getting ready to     162    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. be done, and the morning of their departure Janet felt almost as if a new life had begun. The well-dressed passengers on the cars, the stir and bustle of finding seats, looking after baggage, and bidding 'adieu to friends was so novel and pleasant to Janet, on account of its novelty, that she felt as if nothing could happen to mar her happiness, and yet when night came on and she thought of going to sleep while the cars were tearing ahead in the darkness, all at once the journey seemed hazardous and she began to imagine all manner of perilous things in the way of accidents. "I should think the cars would run off of the track while they are going so fast," she said, getting closer to Mrs. Langdon, and looking up into her face with frightened interrogation. "Sometimes they do, but more frequently they do not," rejoined Mrs. Langdon. "But this might be one of the times when they do," began Janet, " and oh, dear, I shouldn't want to die to-night." "You do not seem to remember, Janet, that God is everywhere, and that there really is no more danger one place than another. Death could find you in your father's arms in your own   UPS AND DO WNS.      163 home as readily as anywhere else, and God can take care of you in the midst of the most frightful dangers. It is said that there was once a courtier standing by King Solomon, and seeing Death approaching, he said in great alarm, What is this shape of terror that I see approaching? I tremble and am afraid? Command that I at once be removed to the fartherest mountain in Cau- casus?' The king said, 'Be thou then removed there,' and the courtier at once disappeared. It is said that Death approaching exclaimed, 'How is it that I see this courtier here? I was told that I should see him at the fartherest mountain in Caucasus.' And Solomon responded, 'King of Death, thou wilt find him there.' "So you see, my little Janet, when the appointed time comes there is no escaping Death. Say your prayers, then, and go to sleep as quietly as if you were in your own bed at home. God is no less here than there, and He can take care of us every- where. Let us put our trust in IIim." \       ,     CHAPTER VIII. DEPTHS OF FEELIN( AND HEIGHTS OF ASPIRATION. iSf 4T was a large, pleasant, white, frame farm house, with wide, comfortable rooms and a general air of thrift and comfort, to which Janet and Mrs. Langdon made their first visit. The host was Mr. John Grayson,- a blue-eyed, genial, unostentatious man,- whose welcome was as cordial as it was unpretentious. The hostess, his wife, was a fair-haired woman in her thirties, who was related by marriage to Mrs. Langdon, and had been a warm friend of hers for many years. She kissed Mrs. Langdon, shook hands with Janet, and unfastened the wrap- pings of the little four-months-old baby, to look for the first time into its round, dimpled face. She had no children, but she had comfortable   DEPTHS OF FEELING.      165 motherly ways that baby seemed to recognize at once, and to cuddle down appreciatively, on account of them. Such baby-talk, too, as she knew; such cooing, coddling, caresing utterancea as went at once to Janet's heart, and touched Mrs. Langdon to tears. "So nervous I am, with fatigue and weakness," apologized Mrs. Langdon, trying to explain away her tears. "So you must feel, nervous and tired," said Mrs. Grayson soothingly, "and you shall have some dinner and then go right up-stairs and lie down an/d rest." Mrs. Grayson was older than Mrs. Langdon; besides this, she had a thrifty, thorough-going manner that seemed in a strong, brave, bright way to make straight paths for the feet of others. She seemed always so willing to bear her share of life's burdens, so ready to give without waiting to be sure that she would receive as much in return. This was just what Mrs. Langdon needed, and she seemed to find in it untold peace and com- fort, Janet watched the two go up-stairs together after dinner, that they might be alone to talk, and she wondered what they would say to each other.     1366   REIGHTS AND DEPTHS. She could not imagine Mrs. Grayson's ever looking pale and careworn and sitting down weak and helpless in a strange silence of tears, as she had so often seen Mrs. Langdon. How many times she had lain awake nights puzzling herself about Mrs. Langdon, and trying to think what it could be that made her so uneven in her moods,--sometimes so bright and cheer- ful,- again so sad and silent, and yet again ner- vous and easily irritated. She began to understand what it was when she heard Mrs. Grayson speaking of it one day to Mr. Grayson and saying, "Ruth is not well. Her nerves are so unstrung that there are times when everything tortures her. I know just how she feels, and I do not think anything can make her feel well until she is well. When people are sick their troubles seem so great to them, and often- times they think others unkind and inconsiderate when it is only that they are sick." Janet heard this with no little remorse for the times when she had been angry and sulky when Mrs. Langdon had spoken sharply and told her to keep the baby quiet when it was unusually fretful.  Girls of thirteen have a way of seeing and hear-  I,   DEPTHS OF FEELING.      167 ing and understanding more than persons as a general thing give them credit for. Janet was so small, so shy and so quiet that it was very easy to forget that she was near or to imagine that she was not paying any attention to what was said, or would not understand if she heard. Consequently there were many things that she could not very well help finding out, among which was the fact that Mr. Grayson, owing to the dishonesty of his business partner, was dreadfully embarrassed about money. So much so, indeed, that they could scarcely afford to entertain visitors for any length of time. "I should so like to make Ruth some handsome present, but of course it is quite impossible now," said Mrs. Grayson, "and I must try to help her I in other ways." Janet never realized how much one may help another without money until she saw how much Mrs. Grayson did for Mrs. Langdon. Such dainty bibs as she made for baby! Such a cunning little pillow, with changes of pillow-cases, and number- less little things not much in themselves, but so satisfactory in the aggregate. Then the sewing that Mrs. Grayson did,-the garments she cut and made, and the many plans     168    HEJIGHTS AND DEPTHS. that she projected and executed for Mrs. Lang- don's comfort. It was not the vain gift of money or elegant pres- ents that she gave, but the good gift of her time, her loving helpfulness and her tender sympathy. "Such a burden, Auntie Grayson, as you have lifted from me you will never know," said Mrs. Langdon gratefully, the morning that she left; "such weary hours of sewing you have spared me; such motherly care as you have given baby and me. I can not forget how much you have done for me." "And yet it has seemed so little. It was all I could do, yet not half that I wanted to do, and it will seem very little when compared with what your other friends will do. Mrs. Bostwick espe- cially, I am sure, will make you handsome pres- ents, and as she is wealthy and a lady of leisure, she will offer you such entertainment as it is out of my power to offer," rejoined Mrs. Grayson. Janet had heard so much of Mrs. Bostwick that she was very curious to see her. Mrs. Grayson had so frequently alluded to her as a woman of culture, who read a great deal, and who had the means and the leisure to make many friends and to do a great deal of good in the world.   DEPTHS OF FEELING.      169 Mrs. Langdon, too, had as often acknowledged Mrs. Bostwick's kindness and expressed the deep- est sense of indebtedness. Janet learned, however, from the conversations she heard, that Mrs. Bostwick had a niece living with her, who had once been a warm friend of Mrs. Langdon's, but who, for some reason, had grown somewhat disaffected towards her. Mrs. Bostwick, however, had written for Mrs. Langdon to come and make her a visit, and they were going there from Mrs. Grayson's. "I do hope you will have a pleasant visit there, Ruth," said Mrs. Grayson, with maternal solici- tude, at the last moment, "but somehow I can't help being afraid that girl will worry you. You are not well, and I know how a selfish, ill-grained person can annoy one with weak nerves." "I have not seen Augusta Lynch for two or three years," rejoined Mrs. Langdon, referring to Mrs. Bostwick's niece, "and as persons change so many times and so marvelously before their char- acters are fully formed, I have no idea what sort of person I shall find her. When I last saw her, she was selfish, dreamy, headstrong and irritable, yet she was in her teens, and I thought circumstances had developed the worst instead of 8     170    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS, the best that was in her, and as she seemed a per- son of more than ordinary intellect, I have been hoping that I shall find her vastly improved. I can look back upon my own past life and remem- ber the immaturity of my girlhood, and how many faults I had to suffer for before I could conquer them. Girls have so many faults, so much pride, and vanity, and conceit that must. be taken from them by disappointment, mortification, and sharp, bitter suffering, that I confess to pitying more than I condemn them." "Well, dear," said Aunt Grayson, with her parting kiss, "I hope you will have a pleasant visit, and that Augusta Lynch will not worry you; it would be too bad if she should." They were on the way at last, but notwithstand- ing all the preparations that Mrs. Grayson had made for their comfort it was a miserably comfort- lessjourney. Baby had the colic and cried almost incessantly. Mrs. Langdon had a dreadful sick headache, and, as if to make matters worse, it rained dismally. "This can't last always. We shall get there after awhile, and Mrs. Langdon's friends will be glad to see her, and we shall have some nice, ,Warm dinner, and baby will go to sleep, and may   DEPTHS OF FEELING.      171 be I can find a nice story-book to read," said Janet to herself, trying to keep up her spirits though everything was so depressing. They reached their destination about noon, and Janet thought the exterior of the house by no means unpromising; it was built of red brick, and had an old-fashioned, comfortable look, inviting in the extreme. No less prepossessing was Mr. Bostwick, who came to meet them with a genuine kindness of manner inexpressibly charming. Mrs. Bostwick, too, seemed trying to be cordial, yet there was something in her manner not quite sincere. She had an air of being just glad enough to ee Mra. Langdon to save herself from the sin of inhospitality, yet not enough to enjoy or to make any one else enjoy the visit. She offered the best the house afforded in the way of dainty food and material comforts. She had set phrases of welcome, yet ther;e was no holi- day in her eye, no genuine warmth in her voice. She was kind, scrupulously kind, yet an indefin- able chill pervaded all she did and said. Mrs. Langdon felt this and shivered under its influ- ence. Augusta Lynch was quite as cold in her man-     172    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. ner, yet somehow Mrs. Langdon seemed either instinctively or from the force of habit, to rely more upon her than upon Mrs. Bostwick, and Janet heard them talking together that night after they had retired to their own room in a way that showed them to have been at least quite intimate. "I feel lonesome and homesick to-night, Au- gusta," said Mrs. Langdon, sinking into a small rocking-chair, and seeming horribly despondent. "I left home to get well and strong, and be bright- ened by a change of scene, and somehow I don't feel as if you were all glad to see me. It is a terrible thing to believe yourself an unwelcome guest. I have sometimes thought the greatest punishment that could come to a suicide would be going into the other world without being sent for, and finding no place prepared, no welcome extended." "Do you think so?" rejoined Augusta, with a small affectation of high-bred courtesy and atten- tion.  Mrs. Langdon had bee on the point of giving way to tears, but Augusta's manner was so icy and unappreciative that she regarded her with a look half of amusement and half of compassion. A little silence fell between the two, during   DEPTHS OF FEELING.     173 which time Mrs. Langdon seemed to grow calmer. At length she said very quietly, "I'm afraid, Augusta, that your Aunt Bostwick isn't glad to see me, even though she wrote so cordially invit- ing me to come." "Oh, yes, he is glad enough," rejoined Augusta, growing all at once confidential and almost unrestrained, "but you know her way. She always did have an air of keeping something back. The more mysterious she can be, the hap- pier she is." Mrs. Langdon smiled musingly, and after this the two seemed to come closer to each other. "Yes," said Mrs. Langdon, after a pause, "your Aunt Bostwick was always the most improbable, and I came very near saying impos- sible woman in the world. She always did the most wonderfully contradictory things, that I alternated between believing her to be a saint on earth and understanding how she might be a hypocrite of the deepest dye." "I think the principal difficulty is that she is a coward," said Augusta. "She is afraid of every- thing. I can't understand it. There is no reason why she should not take a decided stand, and say she means this, that, or the other; but she will     174    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. not. She equivocates and keeps back, and acts secretly, and is always on the fence." "That is because she is always looking ahead, and trying to prepare herself for any consequences of any action. She thinks of the results of things, and tries to manage affairs so that they will come out smooth and pleasant. This, however, is what we should not do. We should think of what is just and right, and leave the consequences to God. Man may propose, but it is God who dis- poses; and when we know that He overrules all our human plans, how much wiser and better it is to leave the consequences to Him.  For instance, if we see a man drowning, and we can not go to him, but may throw a plank to assist him, it is barely possible that we might strike him with the plank and kill him; or even if we should save his life he might be spared to do a great deal of harm in the world; nevertheless these are not the things to think of; -we must think only of what seems right for us to do, and doing that trust God for the result." "I think," rejoined Augusta, "that is true. But awuntie never seemed to realize it. She was always afraid of shadows. If she was forced to reprove a servant for being impertinent to me,   DEPTHS OF FEELING.      175 she would go to the servant privately and explain that she did so to keep peace with me, and that really she did not blame them at all. She always had an underground railroad to travel back and forth on, explaining to everybody how necessary it was to keep something hidden. Peace, peace, to keep peace on any terms, has been her motto, and yet she never can keep peace because she makes people distrust her by distrusting them, and she is so very unreliable in her underground railroad movements that the only way to circum- vent her is to be perfectly frank and refuse to countenance double dealing on any account." "I often think, Augusta," rejoined Mrs. Lang- don, " how true it is that there is nothing hidden that shall not be revealed; no secret habit of thought, no concealed desire or antipathy that will not in time reveal itself. Persons who are greedy, and want more love, more esteem and more consideration than any one else has, over- reach themselves, for in trying to be a devoted friend of two parties who are antagonistic, they must at times pretend to feel what they do not nor can not feel. This gives them a habit of conceal- ing and mangling the truth; so the corroding influence of falsehood creeps slowly over them     176    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. until they become treacherous and cowardly, and instead of having the esteem of both parties have the esteem of neither. They have thought of their own personal interests more than the main- tenance of principle. They have tried to be politic instead of strictly honest, and as perfect honesty is always the best policy, they fail even from a politic point of view." "Sometimes I feel *orry for auntie because she is such a slave to fear. A coward dies a thousand deaths, you know, it is said, while a brave man never dies but one; and when 1 think of the torment she must endure, always dreading some- thing, always secretly bribing and coaxing some- body to keep silence, I really pity her. Besides she has been very kind to me. She has clothed and educated, and taken care of me all my life, and I am really grateful to her," said Augusta, half remorsefully. "And she has always been very kind to me," rejoined Mrs. Langdon. "I can look back on the years of my girlhood, and remember so much generous kindness of hers that sometimes I am overpowered by a sense of indebtedness." "And yet," said Augusta, " with all her kind- ness to you she never wanted me to love you. 1   DEPTHS OF FEELING.     1" She never spoke of you with hearty genuine affec- tion when you were away. She seemed to want to buy for herself all the love that either of us had, and not allow us to care anything for each other. It is mean, I suppose, for me to say so; but the truth is the truth, you know." "Yes, and I sometimes think we do ourselves injustice when we allow ourselves to be bribed to consent to wrong-doing; in other words, when we tolerate evil in a friend that we would not tolerate in a foe. In the sight of God a lie is a lie, no matter by whom it is uttered, and we should not try to make ourselves think that wrong-doing is right-doing because the evil-doer is personally kind to us. We may love them in spite of their faults, and try to help them get rid of their evils, yet to encourage them in that which is wrong sbows that we have no true love for them, but are alike treacherous to them and our, own souls." Janet had been down stairs for a drink of water, and she came back just as Mrs. Langdon finished speaking. She stood for a moment undecided, and thlte she calne up close to Mrs. Langdon, and whis- pered in her ear, "When I was, down stairs Mrs.     178    HEIGHTS AND bEjPTtlS. Bostwick told me to listen to what you and Miss Augusta were talking about, and tell her." Mrs. Langdon made no reply at that moment, yet she took an early opportunity the next day to tell Janet how dishonorable it would be to go about eaves-dropping. "For," said she, "when we possess ourselves of the secrets of others against their wish, we take what does not belong to us, and we have no more right to steal a knowledge of the affairs of others than we have to steal their money or their cloth- ing." "Such funny people I never saw," rejoined Janet.  They are always telling me to listen and tell them something. If you and Miss Augusta talk together, Mrs. Bostwick tells me to listen and tell her what you say; and if you and Mrs. Bost- wick are alone talking to each other, Miss Augusta tells me I must try to remember what you say, and tell her if you say anything about her. What makes them do so?" "I suppose they are afraid that I do not like them,& said Mrs. Langdon. "Do you like them 2" asked Janet. "I used to like them very much," rejoined Mrs. Langdon evasively, and somehow Janet did not   DEPTHS OF FEELING.     179 dare to ask any more questions just then. She felt, however, that Mrs. Langdon was not comfort- able. She knew it in many ways, and child as she was she pitied and longed to offer some word of consolation. Sometimes Mrs. Langdon's discomfort mani- fested itself in a nervous irritability that would make her speak sharply to Janet, and banish the child from the room with the baby. At such times Mrs. Bostwick would say, "Janet is really provoking to allow the baby to cry so;" yet the next moment she would follow Janet and say, "I am sure Janet that you do the best you can; and Mrs. Langdon is very cross to you. I don't know what makes her treat you so." As these remarks were faithfully repeated to Mrs. Langdon by Janet, her visit was anything but satisfactory. Augusta Lynch, too, contributed not a little to the general discomfort. She said ill-natured things and gave herself credit for being very can- did. She selfisly exacted the best of everything and claimed on this account consideration for a fastidiousness that could put up with nothing less. All these things so depressed Mrs. Langdon     180    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. that she wrote home, telling them to send for her immediately as she did not wish to offend Mrs. Bostwick by seeming to leave prematurely. Before she could receive, however, the letter that would call her home, her birthday came. "Do you know, Ruth," said Mrs. Bostwick pleasantly, "that this is your birthday?" Mrs. Langdon nodded assent, smiled sadly and seemed trying to conceal the wretched depression of spirits that well-nigh overpowered her. "Of course, in this country-place we can not buy anything," Mrs. Bostwick continued, " and so I am going to give you the money to buy you a pair of gold glove-buttons for your birthday pres- ent, and you can get them on your way home; and I want you to take ten dollars besides to buy something for baby." Mrs. Langdon looked up quickly in Mrs. Bost- wick's face, realized the generous kindness intended, and then burst into tears. It was so unexpected, and she had been feeling so desolate and homesick. It was not the value of the presents, but the spirit of friendliness that touched her so that her voice trembled when she tried to speak. Janet stood by, looking and listening, and her   DEPTHS OF FEELING.      181 opinion of Mrs. Bostwick was all at once much higher than it had ever been before. She noticed, however, that when Mrs. Langdon told Miss Augusta of the birthday present, Miss Augusta flashed an angry, sneering look at Mrs. Bostwick, and Mrs. Bostwick immediately cowered and seemed to deprecate Miss Augusta's disapproval. All this, however, was lost upon Mrs. Langdon, who was sitting so that she could not see the faces of her companions, consequently she seemed to. grow all at once bright and cheerful, and went up to her room early after tea to write to Mr. Lang- don and tell him how very kind Mrs. Bostwick was. She had her letter about half finished when Miss Augusta came hastily into the roomn in a perfect tempest of sobs and tears. "Why, Augusta, what can be the matter?" asked Mrs. Langdon, rising at once with the utmost solicitude. "Oh, cousin Ruth," sobbed Miss Augusta, "Aunt Bostwick won't be a mother to me, and I want a mother so much. She can't understand me, and sometimes I think she don't try." Mrs. Langdon essayed to offer such sympathy as she thought most appropriate and consolatory.     182    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. She endeavored to lead Augusta to remem- ber the infinite love and patience that under- stands us in our bitterest need, and waits, longing for an opportunity to bless us and make us happy. "Do you really think that God intends all, every one of us, to be happy?" asked Augusta, wiping her eyes and scanning Mrs. Langdon's face eagerly. "Most certainly I do," was the rejoinder. "Why, then, is there so much unhappiness in the world?" asked Augusta. "Because persons will not follow the directions for being happy that God has given. He tells us the kind of disposition to cultivate in order to be happy, and yet when we turn about and encourage a different state of mind, we wonder that we are not happy. Instead of being meek and humble we are full of conceit and vain pride. Instead of loving our enemies, we are ill-natured even to our friends. Instead of loving our neigh bor as ourself we want the most and best of every- thing for ourselves, and feel very much aggrieved when we are inconvenienced ever so little for the sake of others. So we cultivate in ourselves demons of self-love that are forever crying give,   DEPTHS OF FEELING.      183 give, and forever haunting us with their unsatis- fied hunger and unquenchable thirst." "COouin Ruth," eaid Augusta, "I do so want to be a Christian, and I do try very hard to do right. Why don't God help us when we try so hard?" "He does help us," rejoined Mrs. Langdon. "He is helping us all the time. But we do not become Christians all at once any more than we become learned scholars all at once. We must grow in grace and a knowledge of our Lord and Saviour. The growth of the soul has often been compared, in its gradual development, to the growth of a tree. The tree, you know, has its nights of utter darkness. It has to endure blind- ing rains and beating storms. It endures the scorching heat of Summer, the chill breath of Autumn and the bitter frost of Winter. It is stripped of its beautiful leaves and has its seasons of bare, fruitless desolation, yet through all these things the tree is growing; - its branches reach higher and its roots strike deeper, 'and in due season it brings forth abundantly fruit after its kind. If we could remember, when we are despondent, that the soul's night is upon us, and that we may grow in the dark as well as in the     184    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS light, perhaps we should be more patient when our nights come. And if, when adversity takes from us all that seemed beautiful and pleasant to us, we could say; 'it is Winter time now, but the Summer flowers will bloom again,' perhaps we should become better reconciled to what God gives us." "'Oh, cousin Ruth, how beautifully you talk," exclaimed Augusta. "Aunt Bostwick never talks so and yet she reads a great deal more than you do. She reads incessantly, and yet she never seems to have any sort of ability to talk. What can be the reason?" "I think," said Mrs. Langdon, " one may read too much, just as one may eat too much, until the mind becomes, as it were, fat and unwieldy. If we would have our reading benefit us, we must read for the sake of learning something useful, and as soon as we are made better by anything that we have learned we should endeavor to teach it to others, that they too may be benefited. For, if we read merely for recreation or for the sake of our own selfish advancement, and make no effort to benefit others, we shall find our own progress retarded. "The comman. i,' Give, and you shall receive.'   DEPTHS OF FEELING.      185 Give your time, your labor, your knowledge, and your loving, helpful sympathy to others, and you shall receive in return four-fold. Moreover, the providence of God is so opposed to selfishness that the moment we try to appropriate any good gift entirely to ourselves, and exclude our neigh- bor from enjoying it with us, it is taken from us. The mind that employs itself in heaping up treas- ures of knowledge for itself grows, in its selfish- ness, inactive, unwieldy, disproportioned, and thus defeats its own aim." Janet began to nod in her chair, and Mrs. Langdon said it must be growing late and they had better retire. Augusta kissed her good-night with unusual tenderness, and Mrs. Langdon returned the salu- tation with a new, sweet faith that there were depths of feeling and heights of aspiration in Augusta's nature hitherto unsuspected 4or     CHAPTER IX. MRS. LANGDON'S LESSON.. SOMETIMES wonder if the angels ever smile, among themselves, half-pity- ingly and half-forgivingly, as they look down upon this world of ours, and see how great the discrepancy between what we fancy ourselves to be, and what we really are. I can imagine the tender compassion that must shine in their faces as they see how blind and weak and foolish we are. How we suffer for our own wrong-doing, and imagine that we are saintly martyrs and have done nothing to deserve our pain. How we feed our self-love and nurse our evils, and fancy that we are unhappy because others do wrong, and not because we ourselves are less than than perfect. Augusta Lynch really fancied that she wanted   MRS. LANGDON'S LESSON.    187 to be a Christian, and that she was earnestly seek- ing the way and the truth and the life everlasting. Mrs. Langdon, too, was almost persuaded of this fact, and no words could depict her astonishment when Mrs. Bostwick said to her the morning after her conversation with Augusta, "I am afraid, Ruth, that Augusta must have made you very uncomfortable last night. In fact, you made a mistake in telling her that I was to give you the glove buttons. She was quite frantic with rage and jealousy about it, and left me last night violently agitated; and as she went immediately to your room I was afraid that she had wounded you by telling you how angry she was to have me show you any kindness." These words gave Mrs. Langdon a genuine shock, for she had been cherishing a pleasant little remembrance of Augusta's spiritual aspirations, and unwonted tenderness of the night before. So impressed was she by what Mrs. Bostwick had told her, that when Augusta came to her an hour or so afterwards and said, "That talk last night did me a world of good ;" she asked invol- untarily and, I am afraid, a little satirically, "Did it make you willing for your Aunt Bostwick to give me the glove-buttons?'     188    HEIGHTS AND DEPT'S. In a moment Augusta's face clouded with a most unlovely passion, and she rejoined angrily, "No, I am not willing for Aunt Bostwick to give you the same things that she does me. You have no right to her love, and I have; besides, I know that she does not care anything for you, and if she treats you just as well as she does me, how am I to think that she cares anything for me?" In the selfishness of her jealous rage Augusta was positively rude, and seemed utterly oblivious of every law of gentle breeding. Seeing Mrs. Langdon's look of astonishment she sought to excuse herself by saying, ' I may as well be frank and speak my mind at once. I am not such a coward as Auntie, that I should be afraid to say just what I mean." -Augusta's face became more complacent as she said this, for she really tried to persuade herself that frankly confessing how childishly selfish she was deserved some credit. "I should be afraid to mean such a thing," said Mrs. Langdon; "afraid to intend a feeling so utterly selfish and narrow-minded." Augusta retorted angrily and left the room in a passion of tears.   MRS. LANGDONS LESSON.     189 "Dear me," said Mrs. Bostwick coming into the room softly and closing the door carefully after her, "what a temper Augusta has! ZNow, per- haps, you can understand what I have to endure from her unreasonableness. There was never anything like it! Sometimes she renders my life a perfect torment!" "Her own must be equally so," rejoined Mrs. Langdon; "and if I occupied the place of a mother to her I should feel it my duty to impress upon her mind the folly and sin of acting as she does." "I wish I knew how," said Mrs. Bostwick, "but Ilidon't. I shall just have to endure it. I know she expects me to follow her to her room and coax her into good humor; but I can not do it. I will not encourage her to indulge such a spirit." "It would certainly be no kindness to her to encourage her in such a course of conduct," rejoined Mrs. Langdon. Mrs. Bostwick expressed herself as fully agree- ing to this; and yet, in less than ten minutes after- wards, Janet came in to say that Mrs. Bostwick had slipped softly around the back way to Miss Augusta's room and was telling her to "try to     190   HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. have patience a little longer, as Mrs. Langdon's visit would szon be over." No one desired more earnestly that the visit should terminate, than Mrs. Langdon herself; and on the reception of a letter from her husband a few days afterwards, containing the wished-for summons, she began, with the utmost eagerness, making preparations to return home. "Aren't you sorry we came?" asked Janet as Mrs. Langdon finished packing her last trunk with a look of intense relief. "No, I'm not sorry," rejoined Mrs. Langdon. "I don't think we've had a nice time at all," said Janet regretfully. "When things do not make us happy, then we should try to see if they teach us anything; and if we are not happy in the Present still we may be learning something that will make us happy in the Future. When you were learning your alphabet it was not pleasant to you to puzzle over your letters, and perhaps be punished for not remembering them; yet after you had learned to read, how much delight you found in your story- books. So there are many things that we have to endure in this world that not only do not give us any pleasure, but give us a great deal of anxi-   MRS. LANGDON'S LESSON.    191 ety, and even suffering; yet these things teach us something that it is necessary for us to know in order to be able to enjoy the happiness that God has prepared for us, both in' this world, and the next. When, therefore, we find ourselves sur- rounded by unpleasant circumstances, for which we are not really to blame, we may be quite sure God is trying to teach us something, since He gives us no needless sorrow, nor any useless dis- appointment. He loves us too much to give us pain with no purpose in it. He always means something by it, and we should try to find what that something is, for we may be certain it is something that will make us not only Wiser but happier, than we could be without it." "Do you think God has meant to teach you anything by this visit?" asked Janet timidly. "I am quite sure of it; for I have already learned a great deal by it; and the more I think of it, the more I shall probably find in it to teach me my own duty to myself and others," replied Mrs. Langdon. "I should like to know how it could teach you anything," said Janet wistfully. "You shall know when I have a convenient opportunity to tell you; perhaps on our way home     192    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. I may tell you. For the present we have no time to talk. We must get ready as speedily as possi- ble to leave here." Janet was forced to be contented with this; yet she puzzled herself not a little trying to think out Mrs. Langdon's meaning. How could it be possible for Mrs. Langdon to learn anything among people so contrary and deceitful? People who one moment seemed gen- erous and pious, and the next tricky, and contra- dictory! Janet could not understand them; yet the more they puzzled her the more she wondered what could be Mrs. Langdon's lesson! and the more closely she noticed everything, trying, if possible, to discover it for herself. Mr. Bostwick was truly hospitable, and by his genuine kindness of heart made a little glow of warmth in the chilly atmosphere of Mrs. Bost- wick's and Augusta's presence. He did not read so much as lis wife did, nor did he seem to have thought out the purpose and duty of human beings, as his wife said she had done; nevertheless he seemed to make things warmer and brighter for everybody than his wife did. He diffused the spirit of Christ by his kind-   MRS. LANGDON'S LESSON.     193 liness, and reminded one of the love of God by his manner, more than his wife did by all her learned references to books that were written about the great and gracious Creator. My little children, God is love, and the more we love persons with the pure and holy Christ- love, that gives and asks not back again, the more we shall make them think of our Father which is in Heaven. We may talk to persons about their duty and the love of God) yet the surest way to bring them into the blessed state of mind that will soften their hearts towards God, is just to love them: love them so that we think more of making them happy than of being happy ourselves; love them so that we think more of doing such things for them as will be for their good, than will merely make them think well of us; love them until our selish- ness is all forgotten in our love, and we remember ourselves only to think what we can do for them. This is the Christ-love; and the more we feel of it the more we shall benefit others and draw to us the blessed society of those angels who come to help and heal, and uplift the world. We may read many books and weary ourselves with much learning, and give a great deal of 9     HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. money to feed the poor, and have many friends, and imagine ourselves very wise, and very rich, and very powerful; yet all these things are noth- ing if we have not the spirit of Christ; and the spirit of Christ is love, tender mercy that seeks out the poor and the needy, and helps them with the same love that we would help our own father or mother, or our own sister and brother. The poor and needy are not only those who need food, or who need clothes; but those who need kind words, and friendly actions. Those who need help to think how they may make their li.ves brighter and better. Those who need trust to wait until God shall lift the burden and pain of existence from their hearts, and bring them into the peace and joy of the life everlasting. And so long as the world needs these things, so long have we the poor always with us; - the poor in spirit, who need the good gift of such knowledge as will help them to lean upon God, and feel the unspeakable happiness of His love and mercy. Vain is all the learning that does not teach us this. More than vain the riches of money that prevent us from seeking the riches of Iis grace in doing the wonders of His love I   MRS. LANGDON'S LESSON.   195   It, seemed a long time for Janet before the opportunity came for Mrs. Langdon to say what her lesson at the Bostwicks had been. It came at last, however, and she listened with no little eagerness as Mrs. Langdon began: "Well, Janet, you wanted to know what I learned among persons who made me so uncom- fortable; and why God did not let me find a warm, bright, cheery welcome and a restful visit, instead of a cold, stinted hospitality that grudged me every sunbeam. I think our life on earth is a school, and sometimes we have recess;-that is when everything seems bright and joyous, and we do just as we choose, and everybody seems to be helping us to do as we want to do. "After a time, however, 'school takes up,' and it is time to be getting our lessons. God is our teacher, and le knows what lessons we ought to learn, so He gives us such circumstances as are best calculated to teach us what we ought to know. We don't always remember this, and so when we find ourselves kept from doing things thatwe want to do, and kept from having such playthings of fortune as we want to have, we don't remember that it is school-time, and that we ought to be getting our lessons instead of looking out of the     196    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. window at idle children on the street, and wishing we could go out and play and be happy as they  look to be. "We don't remember that all the future is before us, and that we must be getting ready to live in it. We can not get our education in a moment. We get it by little and by little; so we can not have a noble and beautiful character that will be a fit associate for the angels, simply by idly wishing we had such a character. We must work for it as hard as we work to get an educa- tion. "But I must tell you about my lesson. While we were visiting Auntie Grayson it was recess; everything was so cheerful and pleasant, and she helped me so much to do the things I wanted done, and I felt so rested and brightened by my visit. Recess ended, however, with that visit; and when I went to Mrs. Bostwick's school began. Things were no longer smooth and pleasant; but they became perplexing and restraining, and seemed to keep me from being happy, just as a school-room keeps a child from going out to play. Then I knew it was school-time, and that I could waste the precious hours in wishing it was recess again, or in being cross and ill-natured, or in sulk-   MRS. LANGDON'S LESSON.     197 ing and saying, ' Well, I can't be happy anyhow; I may as well be hateful; I may as well stick pins into somebody to amuse myself by seeing them squirm; or, if I don't do that, I can do some fool- ish, idle, frivolous thing, just to get rid of the time until it is recess again; or, on the other hand, I could hasten to get the lesson set before me, and be done with it all the sooner for my studying.' So I tried to learn it, and I think it was this: "In the first place, I learned how apt we are to be disappointed when we expect persons to do so much for us; when we go to them with our weak- ness and weariness, and expect them to comfort and console when they are weak and weary them- selves, and can do nothing for us, even at their best, compared to what God can do. How much wiser is it then to take our troubles to God, and to rely solely upon Him for help; since it is impos- sible for Him to deceive or disappoint us. - He is not dependent upon what we tell Him of ourselves, since He knows the inmost secrets of our natures,' and knows, too, how to comfort us when we are in trouble." "Why, then, don't He always comfort us when we are in trouble, without waiting for us to ask Him?" asked Janet.     198    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. "Why don't He make the sun shine through the windows and doors when we have closed them and drawn the curtains? For the simple reason that He allows us to choose whether we will have the sunshine in the room or whether we will have the room darkened. So He allows us to choose whether we will have His love in our hearts, by opening them with prayer so that He can come in; or whether we will darken the windows of our understanding, and close the door of our hearts, that we may shut out the light of His love and sit in the darkness of our own unenlightened natures. When we pray we open our hearts so that the sunshine of God's love comes in and dis- pels all the darkness of our doubt and the chill gloom of our perplexity. He comforts us, we know not how, as the sun warms us, we know not how. He made our souls as certainly as He made our bodies, and as He knows what is good for both, He will give what is good for both, if we will but take it." "Did you think of anything else that God meant you to learn?" asked Janet eagerly. "Yes, I thought of several other things. When Miss Augusta used to act so coldly towards me at times, and then again come to me in tears and   MRS. LANGDON'S LESSON.     199 ask me to help her be a Christian, she showed me a contradiction of character that set me to think- ing what it is to really want to be a Christian. Some persons think they want to be Christians. They shed tears, and read their Bible, and talk about Christ, and say and believe that they do want to be like Christ; yet all the time they are doing the most outrageously selfish things that could be imagined, and they nor their friends are able to account for it. "I think the difficulty with such persons is that they do not understand what it means to be a Christian. They think it means to feel right, to be respected, to be exalted, to be worthy of receiving good gifts and enjoying great happiness. They think all the time of the good that will come to them in their being a Christian, and so they lose the essence of all religion, which is the spirit of Christ; the loving, generous spirit that thinks of giving rather than receiving; that loves to help others rather than to make others help it; that enjoys serving others simply to make them happy. The joy of the angels is in making others happy. They love to bless and help each other, and as this love is perpetually exercised they must be always and forever happy.     200    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. "Moreover, persons who desire to be Christians simply because they desire greater happiness than they have yet known, are apt to imagine that because they want to do right, and try to do right, they are a great deal better than persons who don't appear to try so hard; and so they become conceited and haughty, and love to be thought well of, and feel angry with those who don't think well of them; and again they lose what they must have to be Christians, which is the spirit of Crist; the meek and humble spirit that does not return railing for railing, but being struck upon one cheek turns the other, blessing those who per- secute, loving those who hate, returning no answer to those who unjustly accuse, and forgiving even those who crucify the flesh and deny the spirit." "It is so beautiful to have such thoughts," said Janet ; " but I don't see how you could. Miss Augusta was so hateful and Mrs. Bostwick was so deceitful I should have thought they would have made you feel cross and angry. I felt so." "It is not what others do that hurts or injures us; it is what we do and think and feel ourselves. If we let the wrong-doing of others rouse in us an evil spirit of strife, or contention, or bitterness, then, indeed, do they injure us. But if, on the   MRS. LANGDONXS LESSON.     201 other hand, we think of their faults only that we may study how to help them to get rid of those faults, and at the same time to avoid being like them, then, no matter how much others may do wrong, they can not injure, but only help us. God does not put it in the power of any wicked persons in this world, or evil spirits in the next, to injure any one who relies upon Him for help and direc- tion. He can teach us how to convert the injury that others intend for us into a blessing; and if we love our enemies, as Christ commanded us to love them, they will often be of more benefit to us than our friends; for, by showing us in their own lives how unlovely is wrong-doing, they make us desire to avoid being like them; and if we love them with a desire to help them to do better, we shall feel no bitterness towards them." "I don't see why Mrs. Bostwick didn't know these things. She was always reading. I should think she would learn a great deal," said Janet reflectively. "Perhaps she may have known these truths, but did not love them sufficiently to live them," replied Mrs. Langdon; "for there is as great a difference between knowing a truth and loving a truth as there is between standing in the valley 9*     202    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. and looking up at a mountain, and climbing up the rugged steep leading to the heights of that moun- tain. The eye readily perceives distance, that it requires a great deal of persistent travel to trav- erse. Mrs. Bostwick enjoyed talking and reading,  and thinking of these things, but to practice them she found involved greater difficulties than she was willing to encounter. She loved to speak of the beauty of a perfectly sincere and truthful character, yet when she herself had to choose between being perfectly truthful and having any  difficulty, she always avoided the difficulty, and  imagined that she did so, not from any lack of love for the truth, but simply from a desire for peace. Then no doubt she tried to confirm her- self in the belief that she was right in being untruthful, because by that means she kept peace; whereas we are expressly commanded to do not  evil that good may come.               s "We can never foresee results. We plan one- one way, and God brings it out another. He can do as He will, and He does not make us responsi- ble for the consequences of anything, if only we have relied upon Him for guidance, and dis- charged faithfully the duty lying. nearest to us. It is always our duty to think of a thing sufficient !* 1 \   MRS. LANGDONr'S LESSOA.    203 to make up our minds whether it is right or wrong; and having decided that, it becomes our duty to speak and act, and cast all of our influence in favor of the right,--not that the right needs help from us, but that we need help from it, and it can not help us save as we advocate and live for it." '"Mrs. Bostwick said one day she could not believe that it would be right to keep people always irritated by trying to make them do their duty. She said she thought it would do more good to please them and keep them in a good humor," said Janet. "I should certainly not advocate irritating any one. Whatever is done should be done kindly, but firmly; yet we do not keep peace by fostering any one's evils. On the contrary, we merely prepare the way for more enduring strife, by encouraging a self-love that will engender discord whereveir it may be found. We must first have war before we can have peace; we must have a conflict with sin, since it is the victory over the evil that is in us that will bring us the peace that passeth all understanding. That is the only relia- ble peace, and the only abiding peace that a human being may know. All other peace is     204   HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. treacherous, and false and culminating in untold wretchedness; since it is the peace purchased by sin; the peace of falsehood, that corrupts the soul with the hideous blackness of fear; the peace of indolence, that rusts the soul with the canker of inactivity; the dark peace of a tomb, but not the glad, sun-lighted peace of a life redeemed from sin and death." Mrs. Langdon and Janet were interrupted by having to change cars, and did not talk any more just then; but when they were almost home Mrs. Langdon said: "I have thought of something else in my lesson, and now it no longer seems difficult, but very easy and pleasant. I seem to have climbed a hill of Endeavor, and to approach the still waters of peaceful enjoyment." Mrs. Langdon seemed to be talking half to her- self, yet Janet listened very attentively as she went on. "In feeling the discomfort of being an unwelcome guest, I became prepared to enjoy getting home again. Home will seem dearer and brighter now than it has ever seemed before, and when little discomforts arise to annoy me, I shall not be annoyed, because I shall remember how much more serious the annoyance I experienced as an unwelcome guest. Moreover, I shall be   MRS. LANGDON'S LESSON.     205 more careful than ever to exercise a warm and generous hospitality towards others; for hospi- tality is not the least of our duties to God's crea- tures! And this, I think, is the end of my lesson, Janet. I hope you will try to remember it, that it may be of use to you through all your life. The lessons God gives us have always a purpose in them, and that purpose is our happiness. We can not always understand how we are to find our happiness, but if we will try to be useful we can always find some way to be useful, and when we have learned to love being useful we shall find our happiness, and it will be beyond our fondest anticipations."     CHAPTER X. CLIMBING TO THE HEIGHTS. HE   Langdons were moving. Moving from the pleasant, commodious house j   i )in which they had lived, to a small frame dwelling owned by Mrs. Langdon. The rooms were small, the ceilings low, and the neighborhood by no means prepossessing. Alto- gether it was a dismal prospect, and all of the family were more or less depressed. "This seems horribly like coming down in the world, doesn't it?" said Mr. Langdon to his wife the evening after they reached their new home, and sat down, amid the confusion, to a hastily- prepared supper. "It only seems so, if we look at it in one way; but if we look at it in another way we shall see it differently. If we consider only having luxuries,   CLIMBIrNG TO THE HEIGHTS,    207 and appearing well in the eyes of others, it seems terribly like coming down; but if we remember that it is from the depths that we may climb to the heights, we shall not regret coming down that we may go up higher than we have ever gone before," explained Mrs. Langdon cheerily. "Well, how do you make it out We are cer- tainly down ;-what is the way up i" asked Mr. Langdon, smiling at his wife's enthusiasm. "In the first place," rejoined Mrs. Langdon, smiling back at her husband, as if coaxing him to listen, "anybody can receive a certain amount of attention who has money. Anybody can buy handsome clothing and fine furniture who has the money to buy them, and so be treated well on account of what they have; but anybody can't be treated well and received graciously in refined society who hasn't money. If a man is poor and receives attention, it is because there is something in his character that merits esteem; therefore it requires individual excellence for a poor man's society to be courted. The ignorant, and the vul- gar, and the scheming will, it is true, be unable to discover this excellence, for they care only for externals; but the wise, the good, and the truly- cultivated will seek him none the less for his     208    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. poverty; and surely it is worth a man's while to know whether it is himself or only his pleasant house and dainty food that entertains persons. It is worth your while to be placed for a time in such a position that you will be enabled to discover how much you can do of yourself without the aid of wealth and position." i"Well, suppose you find you can't do anything; suppose people conclude that you can not amount to a great deal or you would manage your affairs better. And suppose, on this account, nobody will help you to a chance to do better. What then?" asked Mr. Langdon bitterly. "Why, then," rejoined the wife, " you will find a more pressing necessity for greater effort. Necessity will force you to think harder, strug- gle more bravely, and realize more fully, that of yourself you can do nothing unless God helps you. Sweet are the uses of adversity, even though adversity is so bitter. Adversity is a faithful teacher, and the lessons she appoints us are absolutely essential to our happiness. She forces us to learn things that of ourselves we would never learn. She teaches us our real wants and our imaginary wants, so that we begin to see how unnecessary is a great portion of the   CLIMBING TO THE HEIGHTS.    209 toil and care that men undergo to obtain things which they' not only do not need, but which they would be happier without. "It forces us to think how we must spend the money that we have in order that we may not waste any for that which is not necessary, and by so doing deprive ourselves of the means to pur- chase that which is necessary. And this very necessity for earnest thinking develops our power to think, and improves the intellect God has given us. Moreover, by not being able to gratify every wish and consult every idle whim, we are forced to practice a self-control that strengthens and invigorates us, whereas indulgence of our foolish fancies would only weaken and degrade us. "Then, too, it urges upon us industry, that invigorates us and keeps us from the idle discon- tent that pursues those who have nothing to do. Nothing to do is Satan's most active agent, and is capable of bringing a wretchedness that no con- sdounsness of wealth or prosperity can avert, Indolence persisted in deadens the heart, stupefies the mind, and makes of the soul a .charnel-house for demons. Adversity comes to us in the dull, gray cloak of misfortune, yet she will prove an an angel in disguise to' us if we will entertain her     210    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. cheerfully and show no lack of hospitality to this messenger from God." Mr. Langdon drew his wife's head to his breast and kissed her tenderly. She smiled gratefully, and whispered in his ear, "Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith." Janet now became regularly installed as nurse for the baby, the little Adele, who was now old enough to wear short dresses and shoes and stock- ings. Yet minding baby was only part of Janet's work. There were many other things to be done that she learned to do quite readily and nicely. She could sweep and dust, make beds and build fires, wash dishes, prepare vegetables for cooking, and do many other little things that were very useful. In addition to these things, Janet's mind was improving very rapidly by contact with her supe- riors. She learned Mrs. Langdon's way of think- ing and acting about things, and unconsciously she was climbing heights whose elevation she could not guess. "Mrs. Kessler, who lives next door, says she always buys the best of everything for her baby, and she thinks it has more fine clothes than any   CLIMBING TO THE HEIGHTS.    2" baby on this street," said Janet one day, while she and Mrs. Langdon sat peeling some potatoes for dinner. "She must be a very foolish and ignorant woman to talk so," rejoined Mrs. Langdon. "Why?" asked Janet, with no little surprise. So long as her husband has only his salary for them to live upon, and they are obliged to live in a rented house, it is very silly to waste money in buying useless finery. It would be much more sensible for her to save his money, so that if he should be taken sick or get out of work they would have something laid up to buy food and necessary clothing." "I suppose she thinks people will think more of her if she wears fine clothes and has her baby wear them," said Janet, who had not overcome a respect for clothes, engendered by her own pov- erty. "Persons who are not well educated generally think so," said Mrs. Langdon, "and so imagine that every one else thinks so. They do not know that their very effort to look 'fine' stamps them as poor, ignorant creatures, who have associated with uncultivated people, and have learned nothing to make them interesting to talk with. Persons     212    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. may dress with real elegance, which is very differ- ent from Mrs. Kessler's tawdry finery, and yet if they have not improved their minds by reading and by contact with people of culture, their cloth- ing only makes their ignorance more conspicuous, and in society they are contemptuously mentioned as mere shoddy. All the money in the world will not secure persons from this dontempt, unless they have something besides money." "What is tawdry finery?" asked Janet very much puzzled. "Clothing that is showy and cheap, and attracts the eye by being very gaudy, and yet is very coarse. Mrs. Kessler exhibits a great deal of it in her dress. She wears a very large, stiff chignon of mohair, that resembles nothing so much as rolls of sausage; they are oiled so disgustingly. Then she wears cheap, gay-colored flowers, and cotton lace collars, and showy, vulgar-looking dresses." "May be she hasn't money enough to buy bet- ter things," said Janet. "She could buy better things with the same money," rejoined Mrs. Langdon. "Neat linen collars would not cost so much as cotton lace, and would be very much more lady-like, because they would be more modest and appropriate. The   CLIMBING TO THE HEIGHTS.    213 counterfeit of anything is always vulgar. Cotton lace is a counterfeit of something better; but linen is the thing itself. Cheap flowers are also shock- ingly vulgar. A neat bow. of ribbon or velvet would cost no more than the wretched little pre tentious flowers worn by Mrs. Kessler, and besides, being much more durable, would convey an idea of common sense and good taste calcu. lated to inspire the respect of every one; whereas the showy little common flowers she wears only excite contemptuous disgust." "It's funny nobody ever told her that," said Janet. "You mean it is singular that no one ever told her. You must try always to use the exact word that expresses your meaning. Halfeducated per- sons always betray themselves by their use of language." "I never had any one to learn me any better," remarked Janet.  "You mean to teach you any better. Jou must learn for yburself, though others may teach you how to learn," said Mrs Langdon. Janet was silent a few minutes, and then she said suddenly, "When Mrs. Kessler first moved next door, and you saw her piano going into the     214    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. house, before you saw her, you said you liked music so much, and hoped that she would play well; but she don't play well, does she t" "No; her music is like her dress, indicative of very low tastes and very bad bringing up," rejoined Mrs. Langdon. "She plays Captain Jinks of the Horse Ma- rines,' and a good many other pieces that were in my dime song-book that you made me burn up," said Janet, half regretting the lost song-book. "Yes; and such music reflects no credit on any one. I could not allow any one in my house to sing such songs; and the very fact that Mrs. Kess- ler does so, proves that she is not a proper person to associate with." "May be she has a good heart, and would be real kind and good to a person," said Janet, won- dering to herself if there could be no good in a person who wore cheap finery and played "a Cap tain Jinks of the Horse Marines." "She may have a good heart, and might even do a kind act to one who pleased her; but if one happened to displease her, she would be very rude and disagreeable; persons not refined by intel- lectual cultivation are always so. By nature we are selfish, and until we have exercised our minds.   CLIMBING TO THE HEIGHTS.    215 wnd learned to live by reason instead of by mere impulse, we do not act towards others with the kindness and consideration that we should act. Therefore, when I see persons like Mrs. Kessler, who seem to have no culture nor refinement, I avoid them, because I know that contact with them would not be agreeable. Such persons do not reason, they only feel, and they generally feel unkindly. They are angry if any one seems to have more or to know more than themselves, and so they are envious and ill-natured, and will even say rude and disagreeable things. They do not read, consequently they can talk only about clothes, or what some person said or did that they liked or did not like. It does not benefit nor please us to associate with such persons. Do you understand now what makes one respected?" asked Mrs. Langdon. "I understand a little," rejoined Janet; "but I was thinking that everybody don't know these things, and some people in this neighborhood think Mrs. Kessler must be worth knowing, because she has a piano and a marble-topped table in her parlor." "Of course, everybody doesn't know these things; and that is what makes the difference     216    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. between common people and what is called the aristocracy. I suppose Mrs. Kessler thinks that every one must admire a table with a marble-top to it. Such a table would be very appropriate with a house and furniture in accordance with it; but it becomes a vain and vulgar piece of ostenta- tion in Mrs. Kessler's small frame house. She could have bought a plain wooden table for much less money, and with-the difference in the two she could have purchased some good books that would lave improved her mind and benefited her heart, and gained for her more respect from sensible people than she could induce by a houseful of tables with marble-tops to them. How much entertainment or instruction can she derive from a cold, pretentious piece of furniture - whereas a good book is always a friend, beguiling our lonely hours, and helping us to male our lives brighter and better!" In addition to these ideas of life that Janet imbibed by the way, she learned many other things. Among others, she learned to make her own clothes, and as Mrs. Langdon had no false ideas, as some persons have, that those who work must wear the ugliest and most ungraceful things imaginable, Janet was allowed to exercise taste in   CLIMBING TO THE HEIGHTS.    217 her clothing, and Mrs. Langdon took pains to show her what was neat and becoming. Correct taste, however, is so largely a matter of cultivation that Janet could not understand all at once the reason of things. "I should think I might have a little red flower that would cost twenty cents for my hat. It looks better than a bow of ribbon," she said wistfilly. "It looks better to you because you don't know any better," said Mrs. Langdon kindly; "but it does not look better to persons who know more than you do; and if you want them to think well of you, you must wear such things as they admire. There is, however, a higher and better motive than this; which is that the ribbon will last longer than the flower, and for that reason is more sen- sible and economical. Economy is a virtue, and we should praetie it that we may have more money than we otherwise should, and thus will be enabled to help those poorer than ourselves. Spending all of our means in vain show is not only foolish but wicked, since it indicates that we live only for ourselves, and do not deny ourselves anything for the sake of helping others. What you do is respectable or not respectable as it indi- cates what you are." 10     218    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. Janet had another trial when Mrs. Langdon bought her dresses with reference to their dura- bility rather than their bright coloring; yet she was surprised to see how much they were improved by pretty trimmings and neat making. She began, too, to understand something about colors; what colors looked best together, what suited light-haired persons best, and what suited dark-haired persons. Sometimes it seemed to her as if she had learned a great deal since she had been with Mrs. Lang- don, and she would utter suddenly some self- gratulatory remark like, "I used to think if I had a blue dress I ought to have a green or red bon- net, because I thought the more colors I wore at the same time the finer I should be dressed. I wanted everything different colors then, but I know better now. I don't ever wear more than two colors at a time now." Then Mrs. Langdon would say softly, "You must be careful, Janet, that while you are learn- ing to wear modest and becoming clothing on your body, you do not forget to adorn your soul with garments equally becoming.'" "How do you mean?" asked Janet, her look of complacency changing to one of inquiry.   CLIMBING TO THE HEIGHTS.    219 "The garment that your soul wears is woven by the thoughts that you think, and if you are filled with vain pride and conceit, and imagine you know a great deal and look very well, you are putting very cheap finery on your soul. Noth- ing can be more coarse and common than self-con- ceit. It is a tawdry flower that soon becomes faded and dismal, and is of no value. Humility, on the other hand, is always becoming and durable. You think you know a great deal because you compare what I have told you with what the ignorant people in this neighborhood know, and so it seemsia great deal to you. If, however, you were thrown entirely among per- sons of education and refinement, who would con- stantly show you how much more they know than you do, you would then realize how much there is to learn that you have never even yet imagined. When persons are very conceited it is a very good indication that they are accustomed to the society of those who know even less than themselves." "It seems as if there is always something to remember that I forget, or something to learn that I don't know," said Janet quite despond- ently.     220    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. "The more we know, the more we shall find to learn, and the more we shall understand how fool- ish it is for any of us to be conceited on account of what we know. And after all, we must not forget that we know better than we do, and it is what we do or want to do that counts. When I used to tell you that a quiet bow of ribbon was more becoming than a cheap flower you believed what I said; yet somehow you could not enjoy, all at once, wearing the ribbon instead of the flower. You came to it by degrees. It is so with all knowledge. First, we learn what is right, then we learn to do what is right; but it is a longer time before we learn to love to do what is right, so that we do it from love of it, and without goading ourselves on by a sense of duty. When we think of these things we will not pride our- selves on what we know, for we shall realize how small a part our knowledge is, of what is required of us. Knowing what is right, doing what is right, and loving to do what is right; --Can you remember the three steps?" asked Mrs. Langdon kindly. "I will try," said Janet; and trying is the first step. Trying, however, is not merely a resolution of   CLIMBING TO THE HEIGHTS.    221 the mind remembered one moment and forgotten the next; or is it yet an exhilarating enthusiasm of endeavor full of unflagging hope and courage; for alas, what a possible depth of failure forever yawns beneath our feet while we essay to climb the heights of any noble achievement, and how often we rail at what seems a stumbling-block in our path, yet what in reality is only a steep, mountain- ous elevation inviting us to come up higher! So hard Janet's climbing became as the Spring advanced and the Summer began. The baby was teething and grew very fretful and troublesome. The long, warm days were crowded with num- berless small tasks up-stairs and down-stairs, and in my lady's chamber, and when the heated, tire- some day was done Janet found the nights all too short for the sleep that she needed. Mrs. Langdon, too, seemed overborne with work and worry, and no longer found time or strength to talk to Janet, and help her think out the wrong and puzzle and burden of existence. She only said now, "Don't talk, Janet, my head aches," or, "Don't sing, Janet, you make me nervous, or, "Do try to amuse the baby, Janet; her fretting makes me almost frantic." So matters seemed getting worse and worse;     222    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. and Janet began to grow quite thin and pale with burdens that seemed inevitable. Lizzie did not live with Mrs. Langdon now. She found another place when Mrs. Langdon first broke up housekeeping, and had remained there ever since. She came to see Janet one warm day, when everything was at its worst, and her first greeting was, "Why, how pale you look, Janet! What's the matter? But I needn't ask while you have that great crying baby to mind. I should think you'd be half dead." "I am tired," replied Janet; "but there is so much to be done all the time I don't have time to rest as I used to. I never knew what it was before to have so much to do." "I used to think when you were so anxious to get a place you would get tired enough of work before you got done with it," said Lizzie, with a toss of her head. "And yet I must work," replied Janet; "I'd rather work than have nothing to eat or wear. I shouldn't mind work, only I do get so dreadful tired; and I can't see how it's to be helped, so long as there's so much to do. Mrs. Langdon can't do everything; and she has such awful head-   CLIMBING TO THE HEIGHTS.    223 aches, when she has worked too hard, that she has to go to bed." "Well, there are other places besides this,- nice, easy places, where you wouldn't have to work so hard,-and I think you are a fool to kill yourself staying here waiting on Mrs. Langdon," said Lizzie. "It would seem too mean to leave her now while the baby is sick and would not go to a stranger, and while Mrs. Langdon herself is feel- ing so badly. She took me first when she did not need me, and when I had no place to go; and she has, been so kind to me that I don't like to leave her," replied Janet, wondering if Lizzie had for- gotten all these things.  "Pshaw! Kind indeed! She was just kind to get you to wait on her; and if it comes to that, she can get some one else, who is stronger than you are, and you can get an easier place, where you'll have a chance to rest and go out more. You don't have any good times here," Lizzie paused a moment, and Janet looked up in her face wistfully. Yes, that was true, she did not have any "good times," she thought to herself, with a sudden longing for rest and recre- ation I     224    HEIGHTS AXND DEPTHS. "There's Josephine Turpin, who has lately married Pat Mulaney, and she is going to keep a boarding-house, and wants a little girl to wash dishes and help wait on table, and go errands and do little odd jobs, that wouldn't be half as much as you have to do here; and besides, you'd have lots of good times going to picnics and other places, and not have any crying child to bother with either." "Oh, Lizzie, I do believe I'd like to, and yet it don't seem as if I ought to. It seems as if it would be mean," said Janet, sorely per- plexed. "Well, as you like," rejoined Lizzie scornfully, as she took her leave, and resolved to come soon again and renew her persuasions. Janet was very lonely after Lizzie had gone, and the vision that rose before her of living with Mrs. Mulaney seemed very enticing. A desire to leave Mrs. Langdon, however, and remorse at having such desire, made Janet redouble her efforts to please; and she succeeded so well that Mrs. Langdon smoothed her hair softly and said, "You will not have so hard a time when the Summer is over, Janet; and you have been a great help and comfort to me lately. I don't   CLIMBING TO THE HEIGHTS.    225 know how I should have done without you. I shall have more time after a little, and then I shall take you out and let you have more recreation than you have been having." These kind words so affected Jainet, that she said to Lizzie when they met again, "I can't leave Mrs. Langdon, Lizzie! She's so kind to me; I don't think it would be right." "Be right; nonsense! She can get somebody else easy enough," returned Lizzie. "But the baby wouldn't go to a stranger, and if I should leave, Mrs. Langdon would have to mind the baby herself," said Janet. "Well," exclaimed Lizzie, with an air of being very generous, "I will come and mind the baby. She is not afraid of me; and I'd rather do any- thing than have you kill yourself having such a hard time. I'm out of a place now, anyhow; and if you leave Mrs. Langdon she will be glad enough to hire me to take care of the baby, and ,you can have a nice place with Mrs. Mulany, and so we will both have a place." "Well, if I go I must tell Mrs. Langdon about it," said Janet decidedly. "What's the use of that?" asked Lizzie scorn- fully. "She nexer will agree to let you go  10*     226    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS,. besides, -Josephine is going to a picnic next Mon- day, and if you wai t to go too, you'll have to leave here to-morrow night. Don't mind what Mrs. Langdon says; be all ready to-morrow night, and I'll come for you and wait outside the gate until you can slip out to me. I must go now. Good-bye  I'll come to-morrow night for you, sure and certain." After Lizzie had gone, Janet sat very still for some. moments, and tried to think what it was best to do. "Well, Janet what is troubling you?" asked Mrs. Langdon cheerily, coming into the room and noticing Janet's clouded face. Janet colored, and then she said, "Josephine Turpin, a girl that Lizzie knew, is married now and keeping house, and she wants me to come and live with her; and please, ma'am, 1 would like to go." "Oh, Janet," exclaimed Mrs. Langdon in dis- may, "would you leave me at such a time as this, when I don't see how I could get along without you?" "They're going to a picnic Monday, and if I go there now I can go to the picnic with them; and I haven't been to a picnic in the longest   CLIMBING TO THE HEIGHTS.    227 time," rejoined Janet hanging her head, and feel- ing very much distressed by Mrs. Langdon's unwillingness to have her go. "Poor child," said Mrs. Langdon kindly; " and have you been wanting all this time to go to a picnic Are you really suffering so much for recreation? I have been so busy and so far from being well that I have not thought of these things; but I will try to be more considerate hereafter. You shall go to the matinee to-morrow, and I will try to contrive some little pleasure for you every now and then; for I do not want you to leave me. I have grown very much attached to you lately. You have been a good child to me this Summer, and I have always meant to recompense you in some way." Janet hung her head and made no reply. What could she say? The desire for a change was too strong to be conquered in a moment; besides, she was to see Lizzie again the next evening, and there was no knowing what new arguments would be brought forward to counterbalance what Mrs. Langdon had said. She rocked baby to sleep, and then went up- stairs to bed and tried to forget that she had any decision to make.     228    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. She had just fallen into a light slumber, when Mrs. Langdon came softly into the room, and going to Janet's bedside leaned over and kissed the motherless child, with a yearning prayer that the good angels would guide the little waif, and take charge of her, so that none of her steps should slide in their perilous climbing towards the Heights of Divine Love and Wisdom. It was a mother's heart that yearned over Janet, yet she did not realize it then, but slumbered on unconscious that any one cared especially for her; and waked to puzzle over her life, that she felt to be all in her own hands,- to endure hard work, or to choose the splendid "good times" that Liz- zie talked about.   CHAPTER XI. OUT OF THE DEPTHS. T would be hard to imagine a more unprepossessing locality than the one round about Mrs. Mulaney's boarding- house. The boarding-house itself was a suite of dark, dingy-looking rooms over a lager-beer saloon; and nothing could be more dismal than the bare, uncarpeted rooms, the low, smoked ceil- ings, and wretched little windows overlooking a miserable street that seemed especially adapted to brawling women, drunken men and neglected children. The picnic, for which Janet had sacrificed so much, had proved very unlike the "good times" of her imagination. It had been merely an assemblage of coarse men and women, who had quarreled and fought under the influence of bad     230    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. whisky, and not a few of whom were arrested for disorderly conduct and locked up in the station- house. Janet was immeasurably shocked, and asked Lizzie if she thought it possible to obtain Mrs. Langdon's forgiveness and get back into her old home. Lizzie, who was now regularly installed as nurse for Mrs. Langdon's baby, assured Janet that Mrs. Langdon waa quite implacable and would on no account consent to see Janet under any circumstances whatever. 4 Oh, dear! oh, dear! what shall I do?" sobbed Janet. "I can't stay here! It is too dreadful! The boarders all drink and swear, and sometimes Mr. Mulaney and Mrs. Mulaney will get drunk with all the rest, and they throw dishes at each other, and act so that sometimes a policeman comes in and arrests them. Oh, Lizzie, you don't know how awful it is! Some nights I am afraid to go to bed, for fear the house will be set on fire while they are all drunk and don't know what they are doing! I can't stay here; indeed, I can't! If Mrs. Langdon won't take me back I must go somewhere else." "-You've nowhere else to go, and Mrs. Lang-   OUT OF THE DEPTHS.     231 don won't take you back; so you'll have to stay heie, and you'd just as well content yourself first as last. You're too particular about the kind of people you have; you've staid with Mrs. Lang- don until you think you are better than I am; but you are not, and this place is good enough for you if you only think so. I've staid places just as bad as this, and so can you," rejoined Lizzie. "Oh, Lizzie, I can't; indeed, I can't! I've staid here a week, and it seems as if I can't stand it any longer. When I'm waiting on the table sometimes the horrible men that board here will take hold of my arm and try to kiss me, and say all kinds of things before me, and Mrs. Mulaney just laughs and says, ' She'll come to it,' and I don't know what they mean, and I shiver and am afraid." You little fool, what are you afraid of? You needn't mind what they say. Words don't break any bones! Besides, suppose you could get Mrs. Langdon to take you back; that would throw me out of a place, and it don't make so much differ- ence what kind of a place you have as what kind of a place I have, because I am so much older than you are. You ought to be ashamed to turn     232    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. Ine out of a place just because the place you have don't suit you." Janet made no reply. She only buried her face in her hands and wept silently. She felt so utterly forsaken. "She'll cry about it, and then she'll get over it," said Lizzie to herself, as she bade Janet good- bye and took her leave. "It's time, Janet, yeez was setting the table," said Mrs. Mulaney, coming suddenly into the kitchen, with a suspicious air of having overheard the foregoing conversation. Janet got up without a word, took out the soiled, wrinkled table-cloth, and began to set the table. The mingled odors of cabbage, onions, whisky, and tobacco that filled the room made Janet sick and faint, and she longed to be anywhere, any- where out of the world. Very soon, however, the men began to come in from their work, and Mrs. Mulaney bustled about, making preparations for the evening meal, and demanding so much assist- ance from Janet that there was no time for idle despair. It was not until supper was over, the dishes washed, and kindling got ready for morn- ing, that Janet found leisure to sit down and think how wretched she was.   OUT OF THE DEPTHS.     233 While thus she sat, some one knocked at the kitchen door, and the next moment her ifther entered. She sprang to meet him with an eager, agonized cry of welcome that was very pitiful. "Oh, father," she sobbed, "take me away from here! Oh, take me away I It is too dreadful for anything!" "Take yez away? Sure and where would I be afther takin' yez when I haven't a spot to lay the sole of me own fut?" rejoined Mr. Soyer, in a tone of voice that showed he had been drinking. Janet fell away from his arms with a low moan of despair that came from the very depths of wretchedness. "It's out of work I am, ye know, and not a cint in my pocket, and what can I do for yez, Janet a -though I'd shed my heart's blood to give yez a drop of comfort; for yez have always been the darlint of my heart, and I'd lay down my life for yez any time," said Michael Soyer, sitting down and drawing Janet to his knee. She said nothing! What could she say? She did not want him to shed his heart's blood, or lay down his life for her, but she would have been glad of a decent support and protection from such people as the Mulaneys.     234   HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. "I'm your fayther, Janet, yez know, don't you, and I can't help bein' out of work, and havin' no money." "Lizzie says you wouldn't be out of work so much if you'd keep sober, and you wouldn't be out of money if you didn't spend so much for whisky and tobacco," said Janet, scarcely realizing that she was speaking instead of only thinking. "And sure Lizzie's an ungrateful girl to talk so of her own fayther. I'm her fayther, Janet, and your fayther, and don't yez know that yez both owe your lives to me? Your. very lives, Janet, think of that! You wouldn't have been born if it hadn't been for me!" "Wouldn't have been born!"  The words repeated themselves to Janet, and in the blind, dumb pain that possessed her she tried to think what they meant. Wouldn't have been born  Wouldn't have known cold nor hunger, nor home- less wretchedness! That was the way she summed it up to herself, and at last she said very slowly and despairingly, "I didn't want to be born, father!" Well, yez was born, Janet, and I'm your fay- ther, and yez can't do enough to pay me for giving yez life. But children is very ungrateful these   OUT OF THE DEPTHS.     235 days. They don't respect their faythers and mothers as they'd ought. It wasn't so in my day. If I'd a' talked to my fayther as Lizzie talks to me he'd a' knocked me into the middle of next week, and I'd never knowed what hurt me." Janet made no reply. She sat staring into vacancy with a dull stupor of pain that was too utterly hopeless to seek any utterance in speech or even in tears. "If yez didn't want to come here, Janet, why did yez come? I didn't tell yez to lave Mrs. Langdon, and yez should have asked me about it before yez donfe it. Ain't I your fayther, and who have yez to look to but me?" "Oh, father, if I could look to you for help and if you would take me away from this miserable place, I would love you and work for you all my life," said Janet, rousing herself momentarily to make one last appeal. "And haven't I told yez, Janet, that if I had a place to lay the sole of me own fut I'd take yez away quick. Of course I would, Janet, for yez have always been the darlint of my heart; but it's out of work and out of money I am, and what more would you have of me than to give yez my heart's blood if it would do yez any good?"     236    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. Janet said nothing; yet she thought what Lizzie would say if she were there, for she remembered to have heard her rejoin scornfully; "Oh, yes, you'd give your hearths blood, because nobody wants that, and because it couldn't do anybody any good; but you wouldn't give up drink or tobacco, and work steady and keep respectable. You love Janet very much, don't you? Oh, yes, no doubt I But you love whisky better, and being idle better than you love anything or anybody. You may humbug Janet with such talk, but you can't humbug me, so that I'll be satisfied to have nothing and be nobody." Then Janet remembered how her father would call Lizzie an ungrateful child to talk so when he was already "down-hearted" and felt as bad as could be, and how sorry she had always been for him at such times. She felt how worse than useless it was to say anything, and so she sat silent and thoughtful until he told her good-night and went staggering out into the darkness of the miserable street. It was long before Janet slept that night. The burden and perplexity of her life seemed more than she could bear. She could not pray; she could not even think connectedly; yet out of the   OUr OF THE DEPTHS.      237 depths of her despair a helpless cry of pain went up to the Most High, and lo! an unseen angel came to the child, and the burden of anxiety was lifted while she slept. Oh, compassionate Angel of Sleep, there are no depths of desolate sorrow, nor any toilsome heights of agonized endeavor, that may not be gathered under thy wings in a dream of peace And so God be praised    *   *   *   * "I can't keep from thinking of Janet," said Mrs. Langdon to Miss Rachel the next morning, as she sat rocking the baby in her arms to sleep. "She acted in a very ungrateful, outrageous way; and I shouldn't trouble myself about her," said Miss Rachel very decidedly. "As far as that is concerned," rejoined Mrs. Langdon, "we all act, at times, ungrateful and outrageous. And when I can bring myself to remember how many years it took me to find out my duty, and how far I am from doing as well as I know, even when I think I am trying hardest, I do not wonder that one but little more than half my age should fail to do exactly right. Then, too, consider the discrepancy between Janet's parents and mine, and how much better my opportunities have been than hers, even from my earliest child-     238    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. hood, and you will readily understand how ungrateful and outrageous I should be, not to be lenient towards Janet." "Oh, I should not cherish any hard feeling towards her. I should forgive her, and wish her well, but I shouldn't take her back; it would be only casting pearls before swine. I should forgive her for my own soul's sake, but I shouldn't give her a chance to abuse my kindness any more," returned Miss Rachel quite firmly. "In other words," said Mrs. Langdon smiling, "as some one expresses it, you would forgive her enough to save your own soul, but not enough to do her any good." "Umph! Ahem!"Miss Rachel cleared her throat. She always cleared her throat when she felt called upon to speak before she was quite ready. "I'm sure, Ruth, I don't know what you mean by doing her any good. I don't think it would be doing her any good to take her back and make as much of her as ever. It would seem like enco-r- aging her in her ingratitude. You can forgive her in your own heart without giving her a chance to leave you again when you may need her even worse than you do now. I should think that it   OUT OF THE DEPTHS.     239 would be better to get some one that you could depend upon."  Perhaps it would, Aunt Rachel, if it is only my own interest that I must consult; yet how about Janet? Will she find some one to take as maternal an interest in her as I have taken? Will my forgiving her in my own heart, without taking her back, be food and clothing, and such a home as this house affords? I think not; and I think my forgiveness will do her very little good if I express it merely in words." "She didn't appreciate a good home when she had one; and now I'd let her see how it feels to be differently treated. It will do her good," sug- gested Miss Rachel. "That is why I have let her alone all the week since she left me. I wanted her to have an oppor- tunity to judge for herself, and I have thought it for her own good that she should have the full benefit of the experience. But I think now it is time to hunt her up and take her back. I am quite sure that she must want to return by this time; and while the baby is asleep I think I will go and try to find her." "I think, Ruth, you are very foolish," exclaimed Miss Rachel quite out of patience. "What claim     240    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. has Janet upon you? None whatever! She has a father who is a strong, healthy man; let him take care of her. He is able to work, and ought to support his family!" "He certainly ought to; but you know how he drinks, and how little help Janet can expect from him. She is the same as motherless and father- less, and I think, Aunt Rachel, that she needs me, needs my heart and my home." "As far as that is concerned, there are others that need you too; and if you must be so charita- ble, I don't see why you do not take some child more humble and easy to manage' than Janet Soyer--a child with a better disposition. You may do ever so much for her and she will disap- point you at last. She will never come to any good, and you will live to see that all your time has been wasted trying to make something out of her," rejoined Miss Rachel. "Aunt Rachel," Mrs. Langdon's face shone with the reflected light of the angel that prompted her, " whatever might be the result of my kind- ness to Janet Soyer, I should never regret that kindness nor consider the time wasted that I had spent in trying to act a mother's part by her. Everything that I might do for her might seem   OUT OF THE DEPTHS.      241 wasted, so far as she is concerned, yet it would at least not be wasted on my own soul.  If she should give me neither love nor gratitude for my pains, she would at least have been the cause of my exercising tie mother-spirit of love and self- sacrifice, which is the Christ-spirit; and if contact with her should cause me to grow in the likeness of this spirit, I should be more than repaid for any toil, or care, or anxiety, or disappointment that she might bring me.  I can not forgive her enough to save my own soul unless I forgive her this much. I can not forgive unless I love, and if I love as Christ loved us, I shall think more of her good than my convenience." "You could cultivate this same spirit with some one more deserving," said Miss Rachel. "I am not sure of that," returned Mrs. Lang- don; " besides, I do not believe in looking away from a manifest duty, that is near at hand, to see if there be not a greater one afar off for which we must save our strength and capabilities. We lose time while we wait for an opportunity to do more than the present offers. It is not the result of our labors that should be taken into account, but only the continuity and direction of our efforts. It is very litt/o that we can do when we come to sum "     242    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. up the result of human endeavor; but it is the trying to do that helps us, and makes us grow in grace and knowledge. "I was reading the other day about an invalid whose physician ordered him to go every morn- ing to the top of a distant hill, for so many weeks or months, and gather a small, scentless flower that grew there, and take it home with him. The invalid did so, and at the end of the allotted time told his physician that he had only the ashes of a few withered leaves to show for his pains. His physician reminded him how much more he had, a robust frame, a healthful appetite, and all the blessed results that come from persistent exercise in the open air. The flowers he had gathered amounted to nothing, but the invigorating labor he had undergone to collect them amounted to everything. And so it is with the deeds of kind- ness that we do for others. We may see no better result of all our labor than withered leaves; yet Fe whose eye can scan the heights and penetrate the depths of our souls can see how the blossoms of pure thoughts and the fruitage of noble deeds enrich the inner life, and adorn the house not made with hands, until it shall be worthy for the Angel of Peace to enter therein and dwell forevermore."   OUT OF THE DEPTHS.     243 Miss Rachel made no reply, and Mrs. Langdon left the room to prepare for her visit to Janet. Breakfast was over at Mrs. Mulaney's, and Janet was putting away the breakfast dishes when Mrs. Langdon entered. Surprise, joy and mortification swept in alter- nate light and shadow over Janet's face, but no word issued from her lips. Mrs. Langdon looked about the room, and took in the whole wretched place at a glance. "Well, Janet," she said quietly, "I came to see if you want to go back with me. If you do you may go now." "Och, now, get out of me house wid yez, a stalein' Janet from a good home. Get out wid the likes of y ez," screamed Mrs. Mulaney, spring- ing out of an adjoining room as she heard Mrs. Langdon's remark to Janet. "Come, Janet, are you ready to leave this place 2" asked Mrs. Langdon, paying no attention to Mrs. Mulaney. "Oh, yes'm," (said Janet gratefully, and with- out another word Mrs. Langdon took her hand, and the two weft out together. "I don't think I could have, let you stay there a week, Janet, if I had known you were in so hor-     244    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. rible a place," said Mrs. Langdon, as she hurried along the wretched street leading from Mrs. Mul- aney's. "I didn't want to stay. It was dreadful," said Janet, mortified and happy both at once. Mrs. Langdon said very little except to assure Janet briefly of her forgiveness and desire to do all that might be possible under the circumstances, yet there was no need of words--Janet's heart overflowed. How clean and cool, and fragrant of freshly- gathered flowers the house was, when they reached home I It had seemed small when compared to the house from which Mrs. Langdon had moved, but now how commodious and luxurious it seemed after being at Mrs. Mulaney's! How pleasant everything was! Janet reveled in it even though Miss Rachel eyed her sus- piciously, and Lizzie told her she was a fool for coming back. Lizzie had been dismissed for impertinence to Mrs. Langdon, so that Janet did not feel as if she was turning Lizzie out of a place by coming back. What a delight she now felt in brushing out the room and dusting the furniture, and doing little   OUT OF THE DEPTHS.     245 things that only a week ago had seemed so weary- ing and irksome to her. What a welcome, too, the baby gave her! Cooing and clapping its hands, and putting up its little mouth to kiss her, and seeming so wildly glad to have her back, that Janet wondered how she could ever have fancied that nobody cared for her. Mrs. Langdon went about in a comfortable, matter-of-course way that removed all the con- straint of coming back, and made Janet almost wonder if the past week had not been after all a horrible dream. She wondered if Mrs. Langdon was never going to ask her why she went away, or say anything more about the matter. She lay thinking of it that night after she went to bed, and while she was thinking Mrs. Langdon came into the room and sat down in a chair close to Janet's bedside. For a moment Janet trembled and was afraid, then Mrs. Langdon's calm, firm tones re-assured her. "I want to talk with you awhile, Janet, before you go to sleep," she said, laying her hand on Janet's head. "You have no mother to talk to you, and I want to try to do for you what a mother should do, as     246    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. far as possible. And I want you to understand that this is my feeling for you, so that you will trust me and allow me to help you all that I can. When you went away from me I was afraid that there were a great many things that I ought to have said to you that I did not say. But I have been so busy and harassed all summer that I did not feel as if I had the strength to do or say more than I did. I was unmindful though that you had a great deal to do, and sometimes got very tired and very much discouraged, and I meant to recompense you in some way for your trials!" "Oh, it was nothing compared to what I endured at Mrs. Mulaney's. I'm so glad to come back. I will never go away again until you send me," sobbed Janet. "And yet before you left me you thought that nothing could be harder than living with me. What we have to do always seems harder to us than anything else could be; yet if we are always trying to find something easier than what we have to do, we are certain to find something harder. The best way is to do all that we can do, and trust God to lift our burden when it becomes too heavy for us. He does not want us to be unhappy, and when He permits us to be so it is only that He   OUT OF THE DEPTHS.     247 may teach us how to be happy afterwards. You could not be so happy here now if you had not spent so unpleasant a week at Mrs. Mulaney's, yet I am afraid that in a few days the novelty of being here will wear off, and things will seem hard and perplexing again. I hope not, for 1. will make an effort to have things lighter and pleas- anter for you, yet you must not imagine that you can find any place where you will be constantly amused and have nothing to do. You must learn to love being busy, and not only being busy but being useful, for there is no other way to be. happy. All the poverty, and wickedness, and wretchedness in the world may be traced indi- rectly to idleness; and if we cultivate a love of ease, we open our hearts to numberless evils and miseries. I hope you will remember this, and never try to avoid being busy and useful. More- over, when you are again overtasked come to me and tell me of it, as you would tell your mother, and, if possible, I will help you. Will you remem- ber to trust me in future 2" Janet said "Yes, ma'am ;" and Mrs. Langdon kissed her good-night, and left the room. Janet wakened bright and early the next morn- ing, and springing out of bed dressed herself as     248    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. quickly as possible. She was so anxious now to be busy and to show Mrs. Langdon, that she did not want to be idle and useless. After breakfast Mrs. Langdon told her that Bessie and Grace would be home from school the ensuing week, and she might help to arrange their room for them. Janet was inexpressibly delighted with this privilege, and flew about the house with the wild- est enthusiasm, bringing things up stairs and tak- ing things down stairs,-so eager was she to be of some use. The room intended for Grace and Bessie did not impress Janet as being altogether attractive. It was only a small back chamber, with one window in it, and Janet thought it looked bare and unin- viting with the floor covered with matting. It had been freshly papered and painted, and was quite fresh and clean, yet Janet thought it was not pretty enough for darling Bessie. She changed her mind, however, when she saw the cunning little devices with which Mrs. Langdon con- trived to brighten and beautify the room. She made pasteboard brackets and covered them with dyed moss, and made straw-frames for bright- colored photographs that she hung over the brack-   CLIMBING TO THE HEIGHTS.    249 ets. She took half of a cocoanut shell and made a hanging basket of it for a pretty trailing house- plant. She trained ivy around the window, and fastened a board, that was painted green, on the outside of the window-sill, for flower-pots. Indeed, so numberless were the pretty trifles that Mrs. Langdon contrived to ornament the room, that when everything was finished, Janet thought it good enough for even Bessie. "I wonder if she will care anything for me now! It has been so long since she saw me," mused Janet the day that Bessie and Grace were expected. "She has been at school so long among girls who know a great deal more than I do, and who are rich men's daughters, and may be she'll think I'm only a little nurse-girl, and so be ashamed to care anything for me. Oh, dear, it's too dreadful!" Janet was quite overcome with this reflection, and could not bring herself to feel anything but the most helpless despondency in view of it. She had succeeded in making herself thoroughly dis- pirited by the time that Grace and Bessie arrived, and was by no means prepared to have Bessie throw her arms about her and say cordially, "Why, how do you do, Janet?" "*     250    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. It was so like the dear, long-ago, unchanged Bessie IMowhray, that Janet felt her heart growing so full that it overflowed her eyes with tears. -"Why, Janet Soyer, what can you be crying about, when it's so jolly to be home again!" exclaimed Bessie in a brign, breezy surprise. "I'm so glad to see you," sobbed Janet, trying to hide her tears. "That isn't it, you naughty story-teller, and you have to tell me the real, true, hope-you'll-die- in-a-minute reason! You have to do it, Janetl What is it?" asked Bessie playfully. "I was afraid," stammered Janet, "that when you came I should find you didn't care for me any more, and I was so glad to find that you did care for me." "How could I help it? Sister Ruth wrote a great deal about you; and she thinks lots of you, and so do I," said Bessie, putting her arm affec- tionately around Janet's waist. "I shouldn't think you would care tjr me when you had so many nice school-il ses, who know more than I shall ever know, and who have homes and friends, and everything they want. I should think you'd like them best," said Janet wistfully.   CLIMBING TO THE HEIGHTS.    251 "Well, I don't; and I never did and I never shall! I have the very best reason in the world for loving you better than any of them; and you can't guess what the reason is, old Kidlums; can you?" asked Bessie, pinching Janet's chin and smiling in her face. Janet shook her head, and struggled with a smile and a tear. "Well, it's because you love me better than they do, and I love them that love me," rejoined Bessie; and Janet was more than satisfied.     CHAPTER XII. THE EYERLASTHO HEIGHTS. THNK," said Mrs. Langdon, as she sat talking to Grace, Bessie and Janet, five years after the events recorded in the preceding chapter, "that one secret of being contented with our portion in life is to avoid setting our hearts upon having too much in this world, as well as to keep from becoming discour- aged by expecting too little. If we are always straining our eyes toward impossible heights of success and enjoyment, we shall go through life, martyrs to thwarted ambition and cheated desire; if, on the other hand, we continually peer into the shadowy depths of failure, and dread perpetually evils that never come to pass, we shall become imbecile cowards, incapable of any brave, joyous exertion. In both cases it is thinking of self over-   THE EVERLASTING HEIGHTS.     253 much that brings unhappiness. We are so consti- tuted that we can not think too much of, and live too much for ourselves, and be happy." "But we must think of ourselves sometimes, sister Ruth, or how can we take care of our- selves?" rejoined Bessie, who was a tall, bright- faced, womanly girl of eighteen or thereabouts. "We must think of self enough to determine what we can do with ourselves, for our happi- ness depends entirely upon our usefulness," said Mrs. Langdon. "Bridget is a very useful animal. Do you suppose that she enjoys the highest state of hap- piness?" asked Grace, with languid satire, as she took a stitch in her embroidery. "She is happier in being useful than she other- wise would be. She earns her wages by faithful, steady work; she eats heartily, sleeps soundly, and has no real wants unsupplied. How different her life would be if she'were not employed in just such work as necessity obliges her to perform. She would find time hang heavily upon her hands if she had nothing to do, and would most probably take to drinking, quarreling, fighting, and even stealing. She would go Vn from the helplessness of ignorance and indolence to the lowest depths     254    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. of wretchedness and crime. Instead of being comfortably housed, clothed, and fed, she would be a vagabond and an outcast. Our happiness depends entirely upon our usefulness, and there are so many different kinds of work and grades of usefulness in the world, that no one need despair of finding something suited to his capaci- ties, and therefore something that will fill to the brim the cup of his happiness." "I think, sister Ruth," said Bessie, with sudden animation, "that I will be an authoress! I have thought about it a great deal, and it seems to me a very high calling; for, besides all the money and fame that I should acquire, I should have the power to do a great deal of good. I could write beautiful books and lovely poems, and delight and benefit so large a number of people. Don't you think authorship a very high vocation?" "That depends," rejoined Mrs. Langdon, "not only upon the motive actuating an author, but also upon the ability employed to execute the motive. I have known a great many authoresses, and I am sorry to remember that I found the majority of them stilted, egotistical, envious, and hopelessly self-conscious. In my youth I imagined that those who adopted literature as a profession   tHS . VtRLASTING HEIGHTS.    255 must be a race set apart from ordinary mortals, by reason of untold grace of mind and perfection of character; but such has been my experience of women who write that I am constrained to believe them, as a class, neither the best, the happiest, nor yet the most gifted, among women. Too often they have what Holmes calls, 'The weak flavor of genius spoiling the grand medioc- rity of a common-place character, as wine-glass rinsings spoil a draught of clear water.'" "Oh, well," rejoined Bessie, somewhat impa- tiently; "of course I don't mean such authorship as runs to sensation stories, bad rhymes or slangy, ill-natured Bohemian letter-writing. I mean the inspired utterances of true genius." "The inspired utterances of true genius! oh, Bessie, my darling," said Mrs. Langdon, solemnly and tearfully, "how little you realize the meaning of your own words! Have you ever considered what genius is? It is an intellectual vigor of mind'that not only enables one to penetrate deeper, but to climb higher than ordinary mortals. It is not only a desire for perfection in others, but it is a fatal penetration that forever searches the depths of human hearts, and is disappointed because they are so poor and shallow. Sweeping,     256    HEIGHTS AND DEPTH. with eager scorn, from cause to effect, it foresees consequences that it deprecates and seeks to ward off by such agonized entreaty as its dumb, blind companions decide to be the madness of fanati- cism. It is a wretched Cassandra, uttering propheci* that nobody heeds until too late. It is an infinite spirit that has room for an infinite pain as well as an infinite joy. It is a foresight and an insight that comprehends too well the grandeur of achievement and the ignominy of fail- ure to, be patient with the tardy progress of weak. human nature. "It is the intellectual acumen that perceives the truth so far off as sometimes to become discour- aged at the distance to be traversed in order to pitch the soul's tent upon the everlasting heights; or to be perpetually goaded by a spirit of unrest, that is forever wanting to get on, and forever retarded by a sense of human failure. "Unequally yoked together are the affections and genius! Terrible the struggle to uplift the clinging affectional nature from its depths of dumb, blind feeling to the sun-crowned heights of immortal perception. So terrible, indeed, is this struggle, that too often genius degrades itself to the baser service of passion, and becomes a   THE EVERLASTING HEIGHTS.     257 magnificent ruin, a gloomy splendor of most ter- rible destruction, where only dust and ashes mark the site upon which a royal temple should have been reared heavenward." "I think I don't quite understand you," said Janet, who had been listening, for eome little time, with eager, puzzled interest. "I will try to speak more plainly," rejoined Mrs. Langdon. "When I am enthusiastic, meta- phor comes to me involuntarily, and I selfishly revel in scaling the heights of my own thought, instead of lingering patiently in plain speech, to lead others to my level. What I meant to say is this: In the first place we are very slow to learn to do as well as we know. Learning to live is very slow work for the best and quickest of us. We live according to the state of our affections. 'As a man's love is so shall his life be;' and it takes us a long time to learn to love the things that Christ has commanded. "Our intelligence, however, is as much in advance of our affections as our preaching is ahead of our practice. The greater intelligence we have, therefore, the more readily we perceive the truth, and the more we realize the discrepancy between what we know and what we do. The     258    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. more, too, we realize this in others, and become impatient with them as well as ourselves, until this very impatience engenders an irritability retarding our own progress. "If, when we realize this, we become discour- aged and forsake our high ideal, because it is too laborious, we pitch our tents lower down, and the spirit of power, that would not scale the heights we desired, becomes perverted and descends into depths of infernal activity, where it seeks food for the passions, as a less laborious employment than achieving the soul's most exalted heights. "It is in this way that authorship has become degraded to base uses. Persons have written immoral, sensational books and articles, pleading in extenuation that such writing suited the public taste, and would therefore bring the writer money. As if that were any defense One might offer the same plea for gambling, or stealing, or prosti- tution, for money may undoubtedly be obtained by these crimes, as by the crime of disseminating impurity with the pen for the sake of the money to be earned thereby. It is more honest, and therefore infinitely more respectable, to earn a livelihood by daily labor than by ministering to the unsanctified imagination of mankind. And   THE EVERLASTING HEIGHTS.     259 if one be prompted to give his thoughts to the world by motives of vain-glory, selfish avarice, or unregenerate activity, it were better that a mill- stone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the depths of the sea, before he yielded ' to the unhallowed impulse. "They who give their thoughts to mankind should aspire to teach; and they who teach must first have learned. They must have climbed with torn hands and bruised feet the awful heights of such experience as enlightens the understanding and purifies the heart. They must also have lain crushed and humiliated in the terrible depths of most bitter disappointment, that so they may understand the feeling of suffering, and be inspired by this chastening love, to lead others out of the valley and shadow of sin and death. They must have learned, in the unspeakable agony of their heart's crucifixion, how poor a thing is pleasure and how sublime a thing is duty; and having learned this, they must, in love and humility, be willing and eager to 'teach in song what they have learned in suffering.' The inspired utterances of genius, of which you talk, can come only from a soul spiritualized by the sorrow that makes clean, and the love that washes     260    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. whiter than snow. If this be the career that you  would choose, you must gird yourself for the nec- essary training. If you are to be a priestess of the divine truth you must lay upon the altar meaner pleasures than now entice you. They who know most have suffered most, and are capa- ble of enjoying most; yet when you hear the death-song of a martyr, and think of the power and glory thereof, remember, also, the flaming torture that precedes the last triumph of ecstatic faith." "Oh, sister Ruth!"Bessie covered her face with her hands and shivered. "I do not aspire to so much! I only thought I could write some simple story that would tell a little truth tenderly, and mayhap help, a very little, somebody groping and puzzling in doubt and darkness. Isn't there somebody in the world, who knows less than I do, to whom I could say something acceptably?" "Most assuredly there is, Bessie; and if you write for this purpose your writing can but be  noble for the sake of the motive inspiring it. This effort to be useful can dignify and beautify any  ' action however apparently trivial; yet, if while your purpose should be heroic, the performance should seem poor and commonplace and receive   THE  VERLASTING HEIGHTS.    261 the bitterness of criticism and condemnation, do not be discouraged, and so turn about to write something that fools will praise. Do the best you can; not because it will be always appreciated, but because doing worthily is growing spiritually, and this is the end and aim of our earthly exist- ence. It is the true success to succeed with our own character; and it has been said that the greatest benefit one can confer upon mankind is to benefit his own soul; for the soul is benefited and blessed only as it seeks to benefit and bless others."  "Well," exclaimed Grace at this juncture, "it isn't everybody who has a taste or talent for mar- tyrdom or authorship. I, for one, haven't a par- ticle, and I am glad of it; because it must be so dreadfully wearing. Mrs. Poeticus, who writes for the papers, is always either wrought up in a fine frenzy of inspiration, or her spirits have sunken to the dead low-tide of despondency. I don't see what enjoyment she has; for when she feels well she must write, and when she isn't writ- ing her health is so bad that existence must be a burden to her. I wouldn't lead such a life for all the fame and money in the world; because it wouldn't do me any good if I had to work like a     262    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. slave half of the time and suffer like a martyr the other half. I think Miss Practicalus much more to be envied. She has gone into business for her- self, makes plenty of money, has good health, and is as independent as can be. She has business talent, and could take care of herself a thousand years if necessary. Yet I never could succeed as she has done. I have no faculty or ability to earn a living, and I don't see anything for me to do but to get married. 'My face is my fortune,' as the song goes." "Oh, Grace, Grace!" exclaimed Mrs. Langdon, with an accent of despair in her voice. "Have I labored all these years with you and taught you no better than this?" "No better than getting married, sister Ruth? Why, what better can a woman do? Isn't it her mission and sphere, and highest and holiest duty, and all that sort of thing, you know? What else was I born and brought up for? Isn't it the end of the chapter? The end intended from the beginning? Besides, as I really can't support myself, isn't it the best thing for me to do?" "It may be the best thing you could do," rejoined Mrs. Langdon, thoughtfully, "since it may be the only thing that will force you, by Il   THE EVERLASTING HEIGHTS.    263 unescapable and inexorable duties to get rid of the overweening selfishness that now possesses you. It may, after all, be exactly the discipline that you need." "Discipline! I don't care for. discipline. I want to be settled in life," said Grace. "Settled in life," repeated Mrs. Langdon. "As  if anything were final in this world; marriage least of alla where so many contingencies must be taken into account. So far from matrimony's being the end, it is only the beginning of a more complicated life; and if you can not even sup- port yourself, how dare you risk the possibility of being obliged to help your husband support a family, or being left a widow, with children dependent entirely upon your exertions for food, clothing, education and a position in society? If you can not take care of yourself, how can you expect to train your sons to be noble men and your daughters useful women, who will prove indeed helpmates to their husbands?" "Oh, dear! I never thought of that; but I shall take good care to marry a man who has money enough to support me handsomely, and leave his children something to live on after hie death," said Grace.     264    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. "You would, then, marry a man for his money. Suppose, however, his riches should take to them- selves wings, and sickness should make him, as well as your children, mainly dependent upon you for support;- what then would you do?" asked Mrs. Langdon. "Well, in that case I suppose I should give up the ghost at once, and have done with it," rejoined Grace smiling. "Giving up the ghost is a poor way of solving any difficulty. A soul that shirks its necessary discipline in this world, must endure it in the next world; and I fancy that it comes harder there than here. Yet that is scarcely to the point. Giving up the ghost would not clothe nor feed your little children, nor discharge your duty to the man to whom you promised to cling in sick- ness or health, for better, for worse, as the com- pact goes. No, Grace, dear, that would not do. To shirk the responsibility of taking care of your-  self by assuming the heavier responsibility of a  family, would be not only cowardly but criminal.

You would esteem this obalning money under false pretences, and would blush for an acquaintance who would do such a thing; yet women act quite as falsely when they take upon themselves marriage vows involving wifely and motherly duties of which they are not only ignorant, but of which they confess that they have never thought. The task of supporting your- self you would find very light compared to the task of supporting a family." "Well, I couldn't do either one, sister Ruth, so there's no use talking about it)" said Grace pout- ing. "I should try to be a good wife and mother, and that is all I could do." "No woman could be a good wife and mother who had not within herself sufficient resource to earn her own living, if need be," rejoined Mrs. Langdon. "Being a good wife means possessng enough energy, industry, unselfishness and general information, to more than earn enough money to support you. Being a good wife implies enough business talent to have a just idea of the value of myoneys and so expend it to the best possible     266    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. advantage, that there may be no leak in the house- hold expenses to draw unduly upon a husband's earnings. Being a good wife means exercising a supervision over domestic affairs that will make 4tf a house, home,-a haven of rest and peace. It means, too; being governed by a spirit of meek- ness, patience and forbearance, that will enable you to endure from your husband occasional cen- sure for your best deeds, misapprehension of your highest motives, and too often an absorption in his business that will chill and sadden you as if it were the most cruel neglect. It is so easy to prate glibly of being a good wife, when one imag- ines a good wife to be merely a negative quantity of amiability, with nothing to do but receive the wildest adoration as an angel too fair for this earth, and having no duties nor responsibilities beyond an interchange of sentiment during a per- petual honeymoon. And being a good mother! Have you ever considered the meaning of that? The anxiety and agony of maternity? The sleep- less nights required by helpless infancy, as well as the labor, patience, pain and utter self-sacrifice required of a mother for her child? And later, when the child comes out of its babyhood and begins to form its character from surroundings,-   THE EVERLASTING HEIGHTS.    267 have you considered how watchful a mother must be that good seed be sown in the new ground of the child's mind and heart? Have you reflected what incessant prayer is necessary for that mother that her life be a pattern worthy of imitation by the child of her love? If you have not consid- ered how a mother may secure her child's best good,you have no conception of the sweet and awful responsibility of motherhood! To be a good mother requires not only such wisdom as comes in answer to incessant prayer, but such an utter self-abnegation of undying love as (Christ himself gave to the children of men! "Oh, deai' me," rejoined Grace a little anx- iously, " of course I never thought of these things and I don't believe women generally do. They marry, and seem to get on somehow." "And this 'getting on somehow,' as you phrase it," said Mrs. Langdon, "is what has peopled the world with fools and knaves, and made humanity a burden almost too grievous to be borne. This idle, shiftless, unthinking mode of living has brought about the sin and misery of the world. There can be no shirking responsibility, or evad- ing duty, or seeking less laborious ,at ll than God's appointed way, without incurring a penalty     268    HEIGHTS AND DBPTHS. of untold wretchedness. The shortest and safest, and indeed the only path to happiness lies straight over the toilsome heights of duty. We mnay think we have found an easier road when we seek tlte low pleasure-grounds of selfish gratification, li\i we shall surely find that self-love forever leads u: where our feet go down to death and our steps take hold on Hell." "Then you think marriage only a means of dis- cipline?" asked Grace in astonishment. "I certainly think it will prove so, it we have not already been tutored until we have attained sufficient wisdom not only to choose trle most exalted nature but to marry from the hghest and holiest motives, and to be capable also of enjoying the blessed spiritual communion which is the true marriage. The fact that one marries from a selfish seeking after earthly happiness, rather than firom an exalted desire to be useful, proves one to pos- sess an unregenerate nature, requiring such disci- pline as will redeem it from the power of its own evils; and God, who is ever giving us what is best for us, will withhold no good gift, even though it be the chastening love that, beating us with many stripes, will so help us to work out our own sal- vation."   THE EVERLASTING HEIGHTS.     269 "It is very terrible to have such an awful reali- zation of things It makes one feel so dreadfully responsible for everything," said Grace, discon- tentedly. "Realizing our responsibility neither increases nor diminishes it; and amid all the struggle and and strife that may come between the flesh and the spirit, we have the blessed consciousness of a power that, being able to bring order out of chaos, will, in no wise, render unto us merely the meager results of our poor human endeavor, but will give us good measure, pressed down and running over, of the love and mercy that considers the angel- motive rather than the human action," rejoined Mrs. Langdon thoughtfully, while. the unutterable peace of abounding faith shone in her face and trembled in her voice. "Sister Ruth," said Bessie, with a sound of tears running through her words, "why don't you write books, or deliver lectures, or take charge of a church, or let your light sline in some .more brilliant and satisfactory way than just talking to us your beautiful thoughts?" "I've been thinking of late," rejoined Mrs. Langdon, "that I have a work to do, and I shall begin very soon. Janet has now a sufficient     270    HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS. domestic education to take charge of a house, so I think I shall let her keep house for me, and I will pay her a regular salary for her services, that she may put by for a mln'riage dower, when she feels like joining her fortunes with those of some worthy person. Thllis salary will be a competency for Janet, and leave me all of my time for my work?" "What work? Oh, sister Ruth, I know it will be something splendid!" ekclaimed Bessie, with enthusiasm. It will be a work approved of my own con- scielce, and directed, I hope, by Divine wisdol! It will 'be an infant school," said Mrs. Langdon, quite conscious of disappointing her auditors, even before Bessie ejaculated, in shocked surprise, "Oh, sister Ruth, how can you?" "By God's help, I hope!" rejoined sister Ruth, with tears glistening in her eyes and trembling on her cheek. "My own daughter," she said, "is now old enough for lme to commence her educa- tion, and while I instruct her it lhas occurred to me that I could offer the same maternal care to some other little children, and make straight paths for the tottering feet of some other little ones who will need just what I shall give to my child.

There are so many half-educated, undisciplined women who are teaching infant schools, that I think there is a great want unsupplied in this direction. Then, too, the motherhood, that is so large a part of me, yearns to take in these little ones, and give them, what so few women have suffered enough to give, the unwearying patience and undying love of motherly instruction. "Oh, girls, when you have felt the mother- instinct waken in your heart for even one human soul, you will hlave come a long way out of the depths of your' selfish joy and sorrow, and when this divine mother-love has deepened and widened through all your nature until you can feel a mother's charity, a mnother's patience, and a mother's pure and' deathless tenderness for all the world, then indeed will your souls ;stand on the everlasting heights of abiding Peace, and angels will come and minister to you by day and by night!"
