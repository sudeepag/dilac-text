AND ne'er did Grecian chisel trace A nymph, a naiad, or a grace Of finer form or lovelier face! --LADY OF THE LAK.  AN October sun was shedding his dying splendors upoi earth and sky. The level rays bathed the valley throug] which the river poured its swift current in warm light and gilded the spires of the little capital seated on th, eastern bank of the stream with a richer lustre than gol could give. A purple haze rested upon the landscape, an( the tints which the sky wore were of that soft and delicat' kind, peculiar to a southern climate in autumn. Two young gentlemen were walking arm in arm on thi river-bank, observing the effect of the light as the water rushed over the adjacent falls and flowed at their feet, th spray touched by the glowing hues of departing day. I ferry-boat, or flat, as it was called in the dialect of the coun try, bad just reached the opposite bank, and a travelling     8          DE VANE. carriage drove into it, followed by a gentleman and two- ladies, who walked after it. The current being rapid and deep, the boat was drawn from the one bank to the other by means of a rope stretched across the stream and fast- ened at both sides securely; but it required some time to make the passage, and the two gentlemen reached the steep road which led up from the river in their walk, and stood there observing the objects about them as they would have studied a picture. One of them appeared to be about twenty-four years of age, and there was an air almost of sadness about him as he surveyed the wide-spread landscape. The other was younger, certainly not more than twenty, and his manner was animated. "Waring," said he, "this picture almost equals our Virginia scenery; but you want the mountains, and the Germans say you must have them, or a landscape is nothing." "I do not suffer the Germans to decide questions of taste for me," replied the other, "nor do I feel any more respect for their opinions in such matters than I do for their theo- logical views. For tranquil beauty, nothing can surpass this scene." "Ah! you have not forgiven me for my transcendental- ism, as you style it, because I express some admiration for German speculations. Yet I am sure that they hold al- most supreme dominion in that realm, that is, if you ac- cept Jean Paul Richter for authority, for he says: 'The land belongs to the French, the sea to the English, and the air toethe Germans.'" "Certainly," said Waring, "and Jean Paul Richter con- firms my opinion; for he means, that the German mind has nothing practical about it, and is simply speculative, and I think generally misty." "Still, Waring," answered the other, "you must admit          p DE VANE.           9 that a sunset in the mountains does excel this; here you have quiet beauty, I agree, but standing in the midst of our Virginia mountains, you realize what Beattie means, in those fine lines of his Minstrel: The pomp of groves, and garniture of fields; All that the genial ray of morning gilds, And all that echoes to the song of even, All that the mountain's sheltering bosom shields, And all the dread magnificence of heaven." At this moment, the boat having reached the bank, the carriage drove up the steep ascent, and the party in the boat followed it on foot, coming up to that part of the road where the gentlemen were standing; when the elder of the two suddenly started, and then advancing toward the travellers, exclaimed: "Why, Mr. Springfield! have you returned? I am delighted to see you." Ah! Mr. Waring, you are here to welcome us!" the gentleman to whom he addressed himself replied, grasp- ing his hand: "We begin to feel now that we are already at home." 'Waring then spoke with the ladies, who received him warmly, and expressed their gratification at reaching home once more. So sudden had been the recognition of the travellers by Waring, that he had no time for explanations to his friend, who remained standing on the roadside, apparent- iy interested and pleased with the scene; but now War- ing, turning to him, said: "Mr. De Vane, let me present you to Mr. Springfield." And the young gentleman, ad- vancing, was also introduced to the ladies. One of these was Mrs. Springfield, and the other her niece, Miss Words- worth. There was in the manner of De Vane a blended self- possession and embarrassment, which did not escape the     10          DE VANE. observation of Mrs. Springfield, and which interested her; ehe saw that his bearing had in it something of stateliness, and yet perfect good breeding. As the party entered their carriage and drove off, the two young gentlemen turned their steps in the same direction, and resumed their con- versation. "Waring!" exclaimed De Vane, " are those people friends of yours? Melhercule! I never saw so lovely a per- son as that young girl. I give it up! With that addition to your picture, I never saw any thing, even in Virginia, to rival it." "What!" said Waring, "does she compensate for the absence of mountains?" "Mountains! she would shed a glory over Siberia. She is absolutely radiant. Who are they?" "The gentleman," replied Waring somewhat gravely, "is a man of fortune, cultivation, and taste; yet a Meth- -odist, and what it may perhaps surprise you still more to learn, is a lay preacher. Learned, accomplished, and thoroughly acquainted with the world, he is a Christian, and while he is unwilling to assume the responsibilities of a clergyman proper, yet he preaches habitually, and with an earnestness and power rarely equalled." De Vane's face expressed astofishment and yet interest, but he was too well bred to /ay all that he felt. To see such a man, and to hear him hus described, was so unlike any thing coming under his own observation, that he was surprised, and he could not repress some remark of that kind; but knowing his friend Waring to be a Christian, he restrained himself. "And the ladies," said De Vane, " what of them?" "The ladies," replied Waring, "are Mrs. Springfield, the wife of the gentleman to whom I have just introduced you, and a woman of the highest order. The younger lady is Miss Esther Wordsworth, a niece of Mrs. Springfield."   X       ' A,    DE VANE.         " "A Methodist, too?" exclaimed De Vane. "A Methodist, too," replied his friend. "C Mehercule /" said De Vane, using his habitual classical exclamation when he was excited, and added: "I must really know more of them; for that young girl might be an angel just arrived, to show us what the inhabitants of heaven look like." They walked on for a few moments in silence, and then having reached the College grounds, each one sought his own room. John Waring was a native of Georgia. He had grown up in that State; and after struggling with adverse for- tunes for' years, had acquired sufficient means to enable him to take a collegiate course. His parents died when he was quite young, leaving a very slender property for their two children, the son, of whom we have already spo- ken, and a sister still younger than himself. John, then about sixteen years of age, at once decided to give his sister the whole advantages of the estate; and be- gan even at that early age to teach a school. He perse- vered in this, until he acquired what he felt would enable him to complete his own education; and in his twenty- second year had entered the celebrated College in which he was now a student. He was in his senior year, and expected to graduate in December, at the approaching Commencement. He was deeply pious; and had been trained in that religious denomination which had acquir- ed such influence in Georgia, as to number among its members the poor-and the rich, the humble and the aris- tocratic. He was a Methodist. George De Vane was a young Virginian. He had been for more than two years a student in the College, and in the same class with Waring. He, too, looked to a speedy graduation. Younger by several years than his friend, yet he had become intimate with him, shared his love of     12          DE VANE. nature, his passion for books, and his disposition to seek recreation out of the common ways of life. Seeing his matured and well-knit form, no one would have supposed that his health was not perfect; yet his friends fearing that a disease not unknown to his family, might develop itself in him, advised him to pass some years in a milder climate than that of the mountain district of his native State. He was the only son of General Charles De Vane, a gentle- man of large fortune, who had seen actual service in the army, and had acquired distinction in the late war with England. His property was so large, as to make it im- portant for him to reside on his estate; and as his tastes were aristocratic, he saw little of general society. He be- longed to that class of gentlemen, now almost extinct in Virginia, who were as exclusive in their social intercourse as the English nobility. He never travelled but with a coach and four horses; kept his servants in livery; and all the appointments of his large establishment were as formal and elaborate as if the world had undergone no change; just as if the law of primogeniture had not been destroyed, and suffrage made universal. His wife had died when George was but five tears of age, and a widow- ed sister came to reside with hi, who took charge of his household. Mrs. Hester De Vane, who had married her cousin of the same name, to whom she was ardently attached, and whose death she still mourned, shared her brother's aristocratic tastes, but she was in almost every other respect widely different from him. Several years young- er than her brother, she still retained traces of personal beauty; and having been plunged into deep grief by the loss of her husband, who died just four years after their marriage, she had sought that consolation which a stricken heart finds nowhere but at the feet of Him who invites the weary and heavy-laden to come to him-and   3DE VANE.          13 she had found rest. Cultivated, refined, elegant, she was a Christian; preferring her own church, the Protestant Episcopal, she yet often attended religious services else- where. Her brother never accompanied her when she at- tended "chapels," as he styled them. She was childless; and she bestowed on George De Vane 11 the exuberance of her fine nature. She instructed him in those things which only a woman can teach: taught him to love mu- sic, for which she had a passion; to draw, encouraging him to sketch from nature; and she opened to his young mind the hidden treasures of that noble library which had been accumulating in his ancestral home for more than half a century. She saw the grand nature of the boy: grand, yet with faults that might shed disastrous eclipse over all the heaven of his future. Generous, brave, impet- uous, full of truth and ardor, sympathizing with every thing great and noble, yet with strong aristocratic tastes, and not resolute where his tastes were offended; full, too, of sensibility, and impatient of restraint; a genius that almost disdained labor-such were the outlines that char- acterized the young nature which stood upon the thresh- old of manhood. No one of his age was better informed; his teachers had fitted him for college at an early age, de- lighting in his proficiency; and his aunt had instructed him in elegant learning to such a degree, that few of any age could surpass him in acquaintance with English lite- rature. In the society of gentlemen-such gentlemen as were entertained at General De .Vane's table -George was full of sympathy, entered freely into conversation with them, and unostentatiously, indeed unconsciously exhibit- ed those rare acquirements which attracted to him the at- arm  tentions of persons much older than himself. When, too, he accompanied his father in his visits to the capital of his State, he found much to stimulate his ambition. Often he     "         DE VANE. rambled in the great forests which stretched out almost illimitably about his home, taking his gun with him; lift- ing his voice in reciting the lines of favorite poets; and sometimes, like the great Athenian, addressing an imagin- ary audience, in his loudest tones, until the wild woods echoed with his vehement harangues. Oh! what a train- ing for genius, ambition, and sensibility such a youth gives-a youth alternating between society and solitude! How the intellect grows and the soul expands, like nature in that zone lying between the extremes of northern ice and tropical fervors, when Spring breathes upon it!   CHAPTER    II. "' LADY that in the prime of earliest youth Wisely hast shunn'd the broad way and the green, And with those few art eminently seen, That labor up the hill of heavenly truth." MLTON: Ode to a Virtuos Young Lady, RDJE VANE, closely engaged in his studies, did not quit the college grounds again before the following Saturday. His closing examination was about to take place, and he was roused to unusual exertion. The youngest member of a large and strong class, he wished to distinguish him- self; and as he had not bestowed that attention upon his Mathematical course, which the importance attached to it in the College required, he now redoubled his diligence. In Metaphysics and Belles-Lettres, he was without a rival; and few equalled him as a classical scholar. As an' orator, he was transcendent, and his Society had already chosen him to deliver the Valedictory Oration at the ap- proaching commencement. But in Mathematics, his tastes had not been met, and he was respectable, without being distinguished in that department. In the Fadtlty he had friends; but the Professor of Belles-Lettres and Oratory was especially attached to him, and that gentleman had advised De Vane to devote the remainder of his time mainly to the neglected branch of study. Professor Niles was a man of large acquirements; had attained eminence at the bar, and then, while yet young, had given up his profession, and had passed some years in European travel. Before his return, he was elected by the Trustees to the (15)    16          DE VANE. Chair which he now filled, and from the first recitation made by De Vane, in his department, he had formed a high estimate of the young student, which soon ripened into a friendship. He had married in France a young, beautiful, and accomplished woman, and De Vane often passed his evenings at their house, where his tastes were cultivated-music, books, conversation, every thing con- tributing to the encouragement of his favorite pursuits. Walking in the College campus, De Vane saw his friend Waring descending the steps of the chapel, and he imme- diately joined him. "Waring, what are you to do with yourself this fine day? Are you disposed for a walk?" "Yes," replied Waring; " where shall we go?" "Into the town; we may perhaps meet your fair friends once more. Have you seen them since our meet- ing on the river-bank?" "Yes," said Waring; "I called the next evening, and Mrs. Springfield asked after you with interest." "Indeed!" said De Vane. "I am grateful. I hardly supposed she would think of me again. I owe it to you, Waring." "Not at all; she was really pleased with you, and made me give a full account of you." "I trust you were generous, Waring, and did not make her believe that I am a free-thinker." "No; I told her that you wanted discipline; that you were somewhat spoiled, and inclined to be transcend- ental." "Did the young lady ask after me, Waring?" "No; she sat by, and heard my description of you." "And did not ask a single question about me?" "Not one," said Waring. "That is not flattering; she must be as cold as a Greek   DE VANE.          17 statue-she is certainly as beautiful as one. If the Venus de Medici can excel her, I shall pronounce it faultless." "She would consider it no compliment to be compared with Venus, even in marble," said Waring; "if you must go to the fine arts, why not say Raphael's Virgin?" "Because," replied the other, "she does not in the least resemble her. Nor does she remind me of her, except by her near relation to something divine. I am willing to say Iphigenia, or, if you prefer, Ruth, or Eve; but she is Eve yet in Eden." "As you will," replied his friend. By this time the young gentlemen had entered the prin- cipal street of the town; and, walking leisurely, they enjoyed the animated scene. The morning was fine, hand- some equipages dashed past, and the sidewalks were thronged with pedestrians. Quite a number of young people were walking; the students from the College, and the young ladies from the academy and the schools, were enjoying the bright, bracing air. "Waring," said De Vane, " let us look into this book- store; I love book-stores-they are the most agreeable of all places on earth to me." They entered the book-store. It was an unusually fine one; its shelves were enriched with the handsomest edi- tions of the best works in the language; rare old volumes too might be found here; and De Vane had passed many an hour in looking through them. He was soon absorbed by a splendid copy of the Paradise Lost, bound in two large volumes. Raising his head at length, while a smile broke over his fine face, like a sun-beam, "Waring," said he, "come here; I will give you the portrait of your young friend, and even you will not object to a single fea- ture in it." Waring walked up to his side, and De Vane read in his finest style-a style unsurpassed by any one of any age-the lines in which Milton describes Eve:     18           DE VANE. "For softness she, and sweet attractive grace; She, as a veil, down to the slender waist, Her unadorned golden tresses wore Dishevel'd, but in wanton ringlets waved, As the vine curls her tendrils." At this moment Miss Wordsworth entered the store; and Waring and De Vane both colored. She led by the hand a little girl, plainly dressed, but with perfect neatness, and whose young face glowed with animation. Esther Wordsworth was, as De Vane had said, radiant; her complexion was perfect, and her rich, heavy, golden curls fell about her face "waving," in the language of Milton; her large dark-blue eyes had in them a fathom- less depth, which reminded one of a lake; the face was oval; and the mouth and chin, perfect in themselves, gave an indescribable charm to her expression. The profile was classical; the outlines, as clear as if the chisel of an art- ist had traced them, were what we call Grecian; and when she smiled, her teeth revealed their perfect beauty. Slightly above the medium height, her form possessed that roundness which suggests health and activity, with grace; and her walk was elastic and rapid; her dress, made of some dark, rich material, fitted her shape exquisitely. As she entered, both the gentlemen advanced to meet her, and she frankly extended her hand to Waring; her manner showing that she recognized him as an established friend. She bowed to De Vane, who stood by his side. "( We are fortunate, this morning, Miss Wordsworth," said Waring; "we came to look at books, and did not know that we should have the pleasure of meeting you." She rewarded him with a gracious smile. "We often find in books," said De Vane, " unexpected pleasures; and in book-stores we may always look for something agreeable."   DEt VANE.   lI Esther turned her eyes full upon the speaker; there was in his manner something that impressed her--a grace and dignity rarely seen; and his language might be con- strued into a compliment to herself, or it might mean nothing more than he had literally said. She replied: "I am often here; there are few places more agreeable to me; and if I could consult my tastes, I should pass many hours here. But I came this morning to select a book for my little friend here, who is to be rewarded for her diligence and good conduct." The child looked up into the face of Do Vane earnestly, for a moment, and then smiled. He gave her his hand. "And how has your little friend earned her reward?" he asked. "By learning well, and by doing well," said Esther; "I always make my gifts depend on good conduct as well as proficiency." De Vane was surprised; it seemed that Miss Words- worth was a teacher, and yet it could hardly be so. Her position in society, her circumstances, made it improbable. Esther read his embarrassment perfectly, but said noth- ing. "To whom do you go to school?" said he to the child, still holding her hand. " Miss Esther teaches me, sir," said she, half timidly and half proudly. "I see, Mr. De Vane, that you do not comprehend it," said Esther, smiling. "This little girl, Mary Sinclair, is one of my pupils. I have ten." DeVane could not conceal his astonishment; but his good breeding prevented his expressing it in words. There was in Esther's manner something so lady-like, so aristo- cratic, ads De Vane thought, that he could not comprehend how she could be a schoolmistress. She did not explain it, but remarked that having examined her pupils since her  20         DE VANE. return from her summer excursion to Virginia, she had found the little girl, whom she had brought to the book- store, entitled to a reward, and she had come to purchase it. De Vane bowed low, and Waring, observing the scene, smiled. Esther, turning to the counter which stood in the mid- dle of the store, began to look over the new bright books, which were temptingly ranged upon it, and presently selected one. "Did you pass the summer in Virginia, Miss Words- worth?"De Vane asked. "The greater part of it," she replied; " we passed a few weeks in Philadelphia, and at Cape May. But Mr. Spring- field yielded to the wishes of my aunt and myself, and we entered the heart of the Virginia mountains, and lingered there until the frosts admonished us that we must leave." "And do you admire mountain scenery? And prefer it to cities and watering-places?" "I love the mountains," she replied. "They are glo- rious." De Vane was delighted, and he turned his face, lighted up with a smile of triumph, upon Waring. "But," said that gentleman, "it is only in their summer garb that you have seen them; you would not reside in such a region?" "I have never seen them in winter, it is true, but I can imagine that they only exchange their summer verdure for higher glories in winter." "Still," insisted Waring, "you love this dear Southern clime." "Oh I yes, dearly. I love my home, but I should be very sorry to think that I should never see the mountains again." "Miss Wordsworth," said De Vane with emotion, you do not know how much I owe .you. You speak of my   DE VANE.          21 home when you speak of the Virginia mountains; and my heart answers to your language in sympathy which I will not attempt to express in words." Other persons entered the store, and Miss Wordsworth and the two gentlemen turned into one of the alcoves, and began to examine the books which looked to them as friends. j4  Esther had taken down Madame De Stael's L'Alle- magne, and was turning its pages.  De Vane asked if she had bestowed-much attention on German literature. She said: "I have not explored it, but have looked into it, as a traveller passes through a strange country." "And did you admire it?" "The question is not easily answered," replied Esther, "there is much that is beautiful--indeed, fascinating; but I suppose I must admit that I share that prejudice which Madame De Stael says exists in England, against the philosophy and the literature of Germany." "But you observe how she accounts for that, do you not?" said De Vane, taking the book from Esther's hands and reading the paragraph: " e gout de la societY, leplai- sir et l'interet de la conversation ne sont point ce qui forme les esprits en Angleterre ; les affaires, le parlement, I'admi- nistration, remplissent toutes les t6tes, et les interts politiques sont le principal objet des meditations. Les Anglais veulent tout des resultants immediatement applicables, et de Id naissent leurs preventions contre une philosophic qui a pour objet le beau plutot que P'utile." "Yes," said Esther, "Madame De Stael is ingenious; but she was too thoroughly continental in her tastes to comprehend the English. I think she gives us the true reason for what she calls the prejudice of the English people against the philosophy of Germany, when she states, as she does in another part of the volume in your hands, that the chief subject of intellectual pursuit in Ger-     22          DE VANE. many is Metaphysics, and that their system aspires to solve the mystery of creation, and to explore the infinite." "And do you object to that, Miss Wordsworth? Do you Aot agree with her that the enigma of the universe has always engaged the attention of the noblest minds, and that although they continue to revolve about the abyss of fathomless thoughts, from age to age, we must still strive to scale the heavens?" He spoke with great animation. Esther hesitated a moment before she replied; a glow flushed her face, and hel eyes almost swam with tears. She sympathized with the enthusiasm of the young, ardent nature, seeking to find the true and the infinite, and yet without a guide. ",Mr. De Vane," she said, gently looking into the glow ing face of the young student; " we shall strive forever in vain to scale the heavens, unless we follow the steps of Him who has gone before, to prepare a place for us." De Vane started. There was so much of gentleness, and yet so much of courage in this young girl, who made the appeal to him, in behalf of her religion, with such a total absence of affectation, that he was deeply moved. He bowed, and then added: "I think you will agree, Miss Wordsworth, that Schiller sought the divine way. Do you remember what Madame De Stael says of him in his last moments? Allow me to render it in English. 'Stricken while yet young, with a hopeless malady, his children, his wife-who merited by a thousand touching qualities the attachment which he had for her-had soothed his last moments. Madame De Wollzogen, a friend capable of comprehending him, asked him; some hours before his death, how he did: "Still more tranquil," he answered. Indeed had he not reason to confide in the Divinity, whose reign upon earth he had favored? Was he not approach- ing the sojourn of the just? Was he not at this moment near his peers, and about to rejoin the friends who awaited him?'"   lit.     :   DE VANE.          23 "Beautiful!" exclaimed Esther. "Beautiful! Madame De Stael could appreciate the good when it was associated with genius and refinement. I thank her for vindicating the superiority of sacred over classical poetry. Will you lend me the book for a moment?"De Vane placed it in her hands, and she turned to the notice of poetry, and read: "Groves, flowers, and brooks sufficed for the poets of pa- ganism. The solitude of forests; the ocean without limits; the starry heavens, could hardly express the eternal and the infinite, with which the soul of Christians is filled." De Vane looked into her face, as if it had been the face of an angel. She replaced the'book; and taking the little girl by the hand, bowed to the gentlemen, and left the store. Waring had stood leaning against one of the book- shelves, and had silently observed and heard all that passed between De Vane and Esther. His face wore an expression of sadness, and yet the flush of something like triumph overspread it. "Waring," said De Vane, "who is Miss Wordsworth?" Waring smiled. "She is, as I have already informed you, a niece of Mrs. Springfield." "Oh! yes; but give me her history." "Her history," said Waring, "is a brief one, for she is very young-scarcely seventeen. But let us walk, and I will make you acquainted with it, so far at least as I know it myself." They turned their steps toward a fine garden in the eastern part of the town, which was open to visitors. "Miss Wordsworth," said Waring, "is an orphan, and resides with her aunt. Her father was a young Methodist minister, an only brother of Mrs. Springfield, and younger than herself. Thoroughly educated, with cultivated tastes and ample means, he felt it to be his duty to preach the Gospel; and he entered the self-denying, heroic company of men, who are known to the world as Methodist preach-     24          DE VANE. era. He was a native of Georgia, and he married in the neighborhood of Athens, in that State, a young, accom- plished, and beautiful woman, who loved the cause of Christ as well as he did. "In the fifth year of his ministry he was sent to Savan- nah, and in September an epidemic appeared, which swept hundreds into eternity. Mr. Wordsworth sent his wife and their child Esther-then four years old-into the coun- try, and devoted himself to the care of the sick and the dying. The eye that saw him bare witness to him, and the ear that heard him drank in the tones of his cheerful voice, and dying lips whispered thanks and blessings. Worn down with fatigue, he contracted the disease, and sank under it. Mrs. Wordsworth, hearing of his illness, hastened to his bedside, and reached him in time to cheer his dying hours. She, too, fell a victim, and in the course of a few days was laid by his side. One of the most beau- tiffil spots in the cemetery in that city, is that where Ed- ward Wordsworth, and Ellen his wife, sleep side by side; a spot which many feet visit, and upon which many hands yet drop flowers. Esther was taken into the arms and into the'heart of 5Mrs. Springfield, who was childless, and she has resided with her ever since. Masters have been called in to instruct her, and a governess was for four years in the family, but she has never been in a public school. And now you know the history of Miss Words- worth," said Waring, as they entered one of the broad walks of the garden. "But does she teach?" asked De Vane. "I suppose that she inherits her father's estate, of course. Why should she teach?" Waring smiled. "I see, De Vane, that your aristocratic tastes are offended. Yes, she teaches! Some day we will visit her school. It is not very far from here, and lies hid- den away in a garden almost as large as this."   *jg *    '  DE VANE.  Gay groups were seen in the wide grounds, and a fash- lonable party promenaded in the walk just before them. Fruits, flowers, and birds yet rejoiced in the lingering autumn, and th sun shed almost summer splendors over the scene. The two friends took one or two turns  the ground, and then departed for the College.     CHAPTER II. "fIrnL in the soul sounds the deep underchime Of some immeasurable, boundless time. For otherwise, why thus should man deplore To part with his short being? Why thus sigh O'er things which fade around, and are no more;  While, heedless of their doom, they live and die, And yield up their sweet breaths, nor reason why, But that within us, while so fast we flee, The image dwells of God's eternity?" WILLIAMS. THE next day was Sunday. The morning rose upon the earth in cloudless splendor. The serene heavens seemed to bend nearer to a redeemed world, as if they would em brace and purify it. The mocking-bird poured its joyous song upon the air; and the robin uttered its quick cheer ful notes, as it sprang from branch to branch of the China trees, with which the town abounded. De Vane looked out upon nature, but he turned away and plunged into his books. Waring went to church, as he did habitually.   No stu dies could tempt him from attending the morning and the evening service. Upon his return he entered the apartments of De Vane tS -   and found him deep in his studies. "Where have you been, Waring?" "Where you should have been," replied the other.    ": Have been engaged in worshipping that God who mad, the heavens and the earth-both so bright to-day." "Ah! Waring, you are a Christian." (26) !   ,A        tDE VANE          27 "And what are you?" he asked. "Come, come, sit down," said De Vane, "and then you may read me a lecture." "De Vane, will you go with me this evening, if I call for you?" "To go where?" asked De Van/. "To the Methodist Church.  Mr. Springfield is to preach: it was announced this morning." "Most willingly," replied De Vane; "but to tell you the truth, I never was in a Methodist chapel in my life. To hear Mr. Springfield, however, I will go., I feel quite an interest in him." "Very well," said Waring; "I will call for you at 'Ar seven o'clock. We, must go early to find a seat; they are all free, you understand; and Mr. Springfield attracts large congregations." Punctually at seven Waring called, and they walked to the church, or meeting-house, as it was most frequently called. It was a large framed building, destitute of or- naments, and seated with benches, a rail running down the middle of each row of seats, dividing them; the two sexes being rigidly separated during public worship. The building was already crowded; but Waring being a well- known member of the church, found a seat for De Vane and himself quite near the pulpit. As De Vane took his seat, he surveyed the scene; it was new to him. A gallery ran along the end and two sides of the building, for the accommodation of the blacks; and it was filled with them. The pulpit was high above the seats of the building, as if its construction was designed to impress the hearers with the authority of the preacher. Clusters of candles, hung against the walls, and the pillars which supported the gallery, lighted the house. De Vane was impressed with the air of quiet earnestness, which pervaded the audience, composed mainly of well-dressed     28           DE VANE. people, apparently in the middle walks of life; but he observed many who were evidently of the higher and wealthier class, and some gentlemen whom he knew to be persons of distinction, among them Mr. Hallam, a man of the very highest intellect, and Dr. Dahlgreen, who sel- dom attended any religious service, and who was sus- pected of entertaining the sceptical opinions attributed quite generally to Dr. Hume, the President of the College. At this moment two ladies entered the opposite aisle, and took their seats upon the very bench where De Vane and Waring were seated; the for  er separated from them only by a slight strip. Thoy were Mrs. Springfield and Es- ther; and De Vane found himself by the very side of the latter. His heart beat quick; for his eyes met Esther's as she entered, and she recognized him instantly.  The ladies knelt, and engaged for a few moments in silent prayer. Mr. Springfield entered by a door in the rear of the building, and ascended the pulpit. He rose, and there was deep silence throughout the crowded assemblage; he opened the services by reading the sixty-seventh Psalm- that grand appeal to God-to cause his face to shine upon the people; and teaching that, when the people acknow- ledged God, even temporal blessings would abound. Then followed the hymn: "Thou God of glorious majesty, To thee, against myself, to thee A worm of earth I cry! A half-awakened child of man, An heir of endless bliss or pain, A sinner born to die. Lo on a narrow neck of land, 'Twixt two unbounded seas I stand, Secure, insensible! A point of time, a moment's space, Removes me to that heavenly place, Or shuts me up in hell.                IDE VANE.          29 "O God! mine inmost soul convert, And deeply on my thoughtful heart Eternal things impress; Give me to feel their solemn weight, And tremble on the brink of fate, And wake to righteousness." The whole congregation rose to their feet, and united their voices in singing the lines; the blacks in the gallery joined in the song, and swelled the mighty stream of sound, which rolled upward, and away to the throne of God. Esther's voice rose rich and clear, every word distinctly uttered; and such was the ravishing sweetness of her tones, that -De Vane felt as if an angel stood by his side, to lead -him to the gates of heaven. Such music he had never heard before. The tones of Es- ther were not lost in the volume of the -swelling sound about her; but with a clear tender cadence they pene- trated the very depths of the soul, and De Vane felt the tears starting to his eyes. After the first stanza had been sung, Esther, observing that De Vane did not join in the music, handed him her own book; and standing nearer to Mrs. Springfieldj used hers. The prayer followed the hymn, the congregation kneeling, in which act of devotion De Vane's good breeding made him take part. A second hymn succeeded the prayer, and the text was announced, without the least preface., It was from the Acts of the Apostles, seventeenth chapter, thirtieth and thirty-first verses: "And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent: be- cause he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness, by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance to all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.". The sermon was of the highest order. It brought Athens to view, and portrayed the scene where the first great      80-         DE VANE. public confict took place between Christianity and en- lightened Paganism. It represented St. Paul, standing on the Areopagus, surrounded by temples and statues, by all that was majestic or graceful in architecture, and ele- vated and refined in art; the spot where the intellect of Greece displayed its highest forms, and achieved its noblest triumphs.. It depicted the Apostle with his learn- ing, his courage, and his ardor, rebuking the vain attempts of man to embody the Deity in visible forms; and an- nouncing the sublime truth that, since the coming of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, incarnate, suffering, dying, triumphing, the world was under a higher responsibility than before; and that God would bring all men before the dread tribunal of that august Being who, shrouding for a time the splendors of his divinity in the human form, had actually submitted to death for us; but who had risen again, refulgent with the glory of an all-conquering Prince. De Vane was-borne away by the rich, massive current of thought, which was wholly new to him, and he for the first time saw the glory of classical learning pale before the higher glory of Christianity. The temples of anti- quity, and the whole gorgeous world of mythology, per- ished before him, and the cross stood the symbol of the world's hope, bathed in the serene light of heaven. At the close of the sermon, the whole audience seemed released from some invisible influence which had held them in moveless subjection; and a stir-an indescribable mov- ing of feet and change of posture-evinced how earnest had been the attention of the whole living mass during its delivery. A young minister rose, offered a prayer, another hymn was sung, and then the congregation dispersed. De Vane instantly extended his hand to Esther, and she saw that he was deeply moved. Mrs. Springfield, too, came forward,   V?? -          DE VANE.          31 aand gave him her hand warmly, inviting both Waring and himself to visit them. De Vane gladly promised to join his friend in his future visits to the family, and, taking his leave of the ladies, he put his arm in that of Waring, and they turned their steps toward the College. "Well, De Vane," said Waring, " what do you think of a Methodist meeting?" "I must say," he answered, " that I am amazed. I never witnessed any thing so impressive. The music, or rather the singing, was glorious, and the sermon was the finest to which I ever listened. I am almost ready to say that I never heard true eloquence before. How the whole pagan world shrunk, dwarfed before the majesty of the Redeem- der, sublimer in his death than all the gods in their tri- umphs!" "I rejoice to hear you speak thus, De Vane. It proves what I have long believed, that you are capable of appre- ciating goodness and truth, wherever you find them." "I deserve no credit," said De Vane. "Any one would have been impressed by   what we have witnessed this evening. Oh! that my aunt, Mrs. De Vane, could have been present. I must write her such a description of it as I am able to give. Waring, Miss Wordsworth is al- most---" "An angel?" interrupted Waring. "I do not think she -has wings." "I trust not," said De Vane, "for she might spread them and quit this world, to seek her native home above those stars." The heavens were brilliant; countless numbers of stars burned in the deep blue. The cool October air was pure, and the angelic hosts seemed to lookout from the sky, to light the pilgrims of earth to the realms of the happy and the immortal.  CHAPTER   IV. HER voice is hovering o'er my soul. It lingers, O'ershadowing it with soft and lulling wings; The blood and life within those snowy fingers Teach witchcraft to the instrumental strings. PERCY BYSCHE SBHELL]T. As the students were leaving the College chapel, after evening prayer, Waring put his arm in that of De Vane, and walked out with him. "De Vane, I have a note from Mrs. Springfield. She wishes me to ask you to join me to-morrow evening at her house. They receive visitors every Thursday evening, and I think you will be pleased, if you can spare an hour or two from study, to meet some persons who will probably be there." "I shall go, with great pleasure," said De Vane. Little did Waring comprehend the thrill of joy that warmed the soul of his friend at the thought of meeting Esther once more. De Vane was ardent, but he was sen- sitive and proud; and while he did not hesitate to express his admiration for Miss Wordsworth in glowing terms, yet Waring supposed it was only the language of a nat- ural homage to a person of such resplendent beauty. But De Vane was conscious of a far intenser sentiment than that which we call admiration. He had often admired women, but now he felt his whole nature moved. The first warm ray of real love beamed upon his soul, and it responded, like the statue of Memnon, to the rising sun- if not in vocal tones, in thrilling consciousness of the new power which controlled him. He was himself amazed at (32)   ' E VANE.         88 the strength of his own passion; for he felt that already the ascendency of the young, bright girl whom he had so lately met was complete. Her beauty at once attracted him, and her manner, her intellect, her cultivation, so far transcending what he had seen in others, asserted their domain over him triumphantly. Thursday evening came, and when De Vane entered the parlor with Waring, he found the room pretty well filled with persons, engaged in animated conversation. Mrs, Springfield welcomed them warmly, and presented them to two gentlemen who were conversing with her as they entered. One of these was Mr. Hallam, whose fine face, full of kindness and intelligence, De Vane remembered to have seen on more than one occasion; but as he had not gone into society generally, he had not met him before. There was an awkwardness in his lounging attitudes that gave him the appearance of rusticity, and his modesty was such that he was easily embarrassed; but his fine mind shone out everywhere. He engaged De Vane at once in  conversation, and soon interested 'the young student so deeply, that he was startled when Waring, coming up to him some little time after, laid his hand on his shoulder, and asked leave to interrupt him, that he might present him to some other persons. They walked into the next room-the library-into which the parlor opened by two doors, with a pier be- tween; and De Vane observed that it was furnished with exquisite taste. The walls on three sides were hung with pictures, and the third wall was fitted with shelves for books, and entirely filled with them. Large, handsome fauteuils, sofas covered with bright stuff, and a few light, tasteful chairs, were placed in the room so as to afford seats for those who wished to examine a book or print in any part of the room. A rosewood cabinet-table stood near the centre of the floor, and rich crimson silk curtains 3*     34          DE VANE.              -. draped the windows. On the white marble mantel stood a splendid French clock, ornamented with the figure of Pe- trarch seated, his arm resting on a tablet, inscribed with the name of Laura. Against the pier was placed a piano- forte, a splendid instrument, open, and some sheets of new music laid on it. Over the instrument hung a portrait of Esther, in the highest style of art. It was a bust, the head turned and looking away, so as to show the profile in part, while yet the expression of the whole face was preserved. It was in an oval frame, of a rich, massive style. De Vane saw all this at a glance, accustomed as he was at home to such surroundings. Several gentlemen were standing with Sir. Springfield as De Vane and Waring entered the room, in conversation with him, but when he saw the students he advanced to meet them. "Mr. De Vane," said Mr. Springfield, "I am happy to : see you in my house. Your friend, Mr. Waring, has made ij? me feel as if I had long known you."         :H: De Vane bowed low, and he was presented to the other :! gentlemen. Up to this time, De Vane had not seen Es- - ther; but, turning away from the gentlemen, who gow resumed their conversation, he saw her seated in the midst : of a group of ladies, over whose chairs two or three young it rmen were bending, listening to a narrative which some one was giving, of a distressing accident which had oc- : curred that day. De Vane drew near, and Esther rose to  meet him, extending her hand to him with frank cordiality. He joined the group, and the conversation became general. "Ah! Miss Wordsworth, you are, as usual, surrounded r in such a way that one with less courage than I possess -a would hardly venture to attempt to reach you."    X: De Vane quickly turned to observe the new-comer. He : was a large, well-formed man, who appeared to be but little : more than thirty years of age. His ruddy complexion, blue :S eyes, and light hair gave him somewhat the appearance of !   DE VANE.          35 an English gentleman. His face beamed with animation, and there was unusual grace in his attitude. His voice and his enunciation at once attracted and charmed De Vane, and as he approached Esther he bowed very low, and taking her hand, touched it with his lips. "O Mr. Clarendon!" she exclaimed, "I am delighted to see you. Is Mrs. Clarendon with you?" "Alas! no," he replied,- " she charged me with kind messages to you, but dared not take the night-air." Esther, turning to De Vane, said: "I wish to present you a6 Mr. Clarendon; he too is a Virginian, and loves the mountains of his native State."7 Mr. Clarendon shook his hand warmly, and expressed his pleasure at meeting him. I wonder," said he, ".that I have not met you before; you must have hid yourself." "I have not gone out much," replied De Vane,' "and when not engaged in College duties, I have found in the library so much to interest me, that I pass most of mny hours there. I did not know until now how much I was losing." Esther was standing by the, side of Mr. Clarendon, and De Vane's glance was for an instant turned on her as he said this. Still the remark might have been intended to take in Mr. Clarendon too; and while she colored-she was conscious that she did so-she replied that she was happy to have the good fortune to introduce' him to her friend, to whom she felt herself indebted for so many bright hours. Mr. Clarendon bowed, and said: "Mr. De Vane, I trust you are acquainted with the art of self-defense; if not, I suggest that you begin presently to study it." They all laughed, and the conversation took a general range, embracing books, the fine arts, and religion-a sub- ject which Esther introduced by remarking to Mr. Claren-     86          DE VANE.              ; don, that during the past summer she had heard the ven- erable Bishop McKendree preach, and added: "I am happy to say that he is to be here sometime this winter." Mr. Clarendon replied: "I am happy to hear it. I have  been taught by a good aunt of mine to venerate him, for she ranks him next to her friend Bishop Asbury."  De Vane took part in the conversation, spoke with ani- mation upon the several subjects, and disclosed a degree of cultivation which surprised Mr. Clarendon; while he, on his part, felt his admiration of that gentleman rising into enthusiasm. Speaking of him to Esther afterward, he said:  "Your friend, Mr. Clarendon, charms me; he has 'The large utterance of the early gods.' " "Did you ever hear Bishop McKendree?"Esther in- quired of De Vane.  "I ashamed to say," he answered, " that I never heard any preacher of that denomination until last Sunday even- ing, and you may imagine my surprise-and gratification." X "I always go to hear my friend Springfield, Mr. De  :- Vane," said Mr. Clarendon, "and I will go anywhere to  hear a true man who can interest and instruct me. We  are too much governed in our good old commonwealth-- which I love as well as you do--by aristocratic habits; and the same thing may be said of this State. It is giving  way, however, to some extent; for intellectual power has  a certain majesty about it which compels reluctant homage where it is not freely yielded; and the Methodist Church numbers in its ministry some men of the highest order." ; Waring came up at this moment. -A "My friend," said De Vane, turning to him, "has said I so to me, and I shall hereafter put myself under his guid.  ance-at least, in spiritual matters."   DE VANE.          87  "Better seek a better guide," said Waring gravely. "There is One always ready to lead us into all truth." "I think, Waring, you follow Him closely," said De Vane, "and if I keep by your side, I shall not be far out of the way." Esther gave him a smile, which showed how she valued this frank tribute to the worth of Waring. Mr. Clarendon said: "Miss Wordsworth, will you give us some music?" She took his arm, and he seated her at the piano. "What shall I give you, Mr. Clarendon?" "There is a song that has just been written by a friend of mine, a Georgian, an eminent lawyer, and I believe it has been set to music," he replied. "It is very sad though-perhaps too much so for you: 'My life is like the summer rose.'" "I have it here," said Esther;" it was sent to me to- day by the author of the lines, who was a friend of my mother." Her voice almost trembled. She took up one of the sheets of music lying near her, spread it before her, and running her fingers over the keys of the instrument, drew from it such notes that it seemed to have a soul. Her golden hair fell in rich ringlets about her face, except the heavy braid which was held by a clasp of Etruscan gold on the back of the head, and the blue of heaven shone in the lustre of her eyes. She seemed to De Vane a youthful priestess, transcending in her loveli- ness, the highest impersonations of classical beauty; warm, and yet pure, as if an angel had come for a season to so- journ on earth and bring human passion under the domin- ion of Christian sentiment. She sang the lines with indescribable tenderness, and it seemed as if the very spirit of sadness dwelt under the keys which she touched.     38             DE VANE. "My life is like the summer rose That opens to the morning sky, But ere the shades of evening close-  Is scattered on the ground-to die!           % Yet on the rose's humble bed  The sweetest dews of night are shed, As if she wept the waste to see--  But none shall weep a tear for me!  "My life is like the autumn leaf That trembles to the moon's pale ray; Its hold is frail-its date is brief, Restless, and soon to pass away! Yet, ere that leaf shall fall and fade, The parent tree will mourn its shade, The winds bewail the leafless tree-  But none shall weep a tear for me! My life is like the prints which feet  Have left on Tampa's desert strand;  Soon as the rising tide shall beat, All trace will vanish from the sand. Yet, as if grieving to efface All vestige of the human race,            .g On that lone shore loud moans the sea-- But none, alas! shall mourn for me P" "The  lines are very beautiful," said Mr. Clarendon, "but, oh! how sad."  "And do you not love sad music?" she asked, look- ing up. "Not at all times-I am    capricious; but I love youi music, whether it be joyous, or steeped in sorrow." De Vane had not uttered a word-he could not.      Esther turned to him, and asked if there were any piece of music which  he especially  admired.  He roused himself, and breathed deeply, as if just restored to consciousness.  "Do  you sing Jephthah's Daughter, Byron's Hebrew  melody?" lhe inquired. .    DE VANE.          39 "Yes," she answered, "but that, too, is sad." "I can scarcely feel that any thing deserves the name of music that is not sad," said De Vane. "I quite agree with you," she answered with animation "except in sacred music. There I love the joyous, the ex- ultant, the triumphant, as well as the tender." "You should heai the Miserere, Miss Wordsworth, as I have heard it in Rome, if you would comprehend the depths of sadness in music," said Mr. Clarendon. Quite a number of persons had now gathered about the piano, Esther touched the keys and sang, with unrivalled pathos, the song for which De Vane had asked; and as she uttered the prolonged cadence of the closing line- "And forget not I smiled as I died'!" tears were in the eyes of many who heard her. De Vane could not conceal his emotion, and he observed that Mr. Clarendon was moved; but that gentleman said: "Miss Wordsworth, I did not come here this evening to have the fountain of my tears unsealed, and I shall insist upon something brighter than all this." "Yet," said Esther, "what a glory breaks over the dirge-what a wild, passionate, exultant triumph bursts forth from the dying Jewish maiden, as she remembers that she had won the great battle for her sire, and that her country was free! How grandly she says: 'Though the virgins of Salem lament, Be the judge and the hero unbent!'  "Thanks, Miss Wordsworth-thanks," exclaimed De Vane, "for your vindication of my taste." "The wonder with me is," said Waring, "that Lord Byron could write such a song."  "Men are often much misunderstood," said De Vane. "Lord Byron had in his nature the elements of religion; if he sinned, he was sorely sinned against."     40          DE VANE.  - "His religious elements must have been sadly perverted, to permit him to live as he lived, and to write as he wrote,"  rejoined Waring.  "Yet," said Mr. Clarendon, "if he was a fallen angel, he was like Milton's-his form had not lost all the original ' brightness." Esther looked at him as if grateful that he had said a word somewhat favorable to De Vane's estimate of the noble poet. "Esther," said M]r. Springfield, "will you give us one of your sacred songs?" "Gladly," she replied; and she sang that beautiful hymn, "Rock of ages, cleft for me;" while Waring accompanied her, his voice sustaining hers admirably. Again De Vane was subdued, and could only bow, as the song ceased and she rose from her seat.    : "That," said Mr. Clarendon, "excels the Miserere," and then added: "Is that line of the first song which you gave us, Miss Wordsworth-where the prints which feet leave   :i on Tampa's desert strand are introduced--correct? Does  not the writer mean Tempe?"  "I should refer that critical difficulty to you for solu-  tion," she replied. "Well, I am a little puzzled about it," said he. "I think," said De Vane, "that the author of the lines means what he has written. The vale of Tempe in Thes-  saly, can hardly be called desert, for its charms are well :i known, and the banks of the Peneus, which flows through  ' it, could not, by even poetical license, be described as a  strand.  "What, then, can he mean? Where is Tampa?" said  Mr. Clarendon.           :/ "It is on the coast of Florida," said De Vane. "It so  happened that I made a visit to that coast just before I   DE VANE.         41 entered college; and hearing the temperature of Tampa spoken of as favorable to invalids, I passed some weeks there. A more sad and even desert strand I do not know anywhere; and the wail of the sea on the lone shore is the most mournful of earthly sounds." "You have solved the problem," said Mr. Clarendon. "I thought Wilde had been using his prerogative as a poet somewhat freely; for I remember how the valley of Tempe impressed me with its wild beauty-Ossa on the one side, and Olympus, rich with its woods and herbage, on the other. It was not a desert." De Vane had made a life-long friend of Mr. Clarendon. Before taking leave of Mrs. Springfield, he said to her: "Madam, I commend that young Virginian to you. He is my countryman, and I am proud of him. If I read him rightly, Virginia will be still prouder of him." The evening closed. The guests departed, and De Vane felt as if his real life had just begun. Light had spread over his soul as over the young world, when it was said: "The evening and the morning were the first day."     CHAE ,. CHAPTER   I. MOTHER, mother, up in heaven, Stand up on the jasper sea, And be witness I have given All the gifts required of me. ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING.  WuEN Saturday came-the college exercises being sus- pended, that the students might seek recreation outside of the grounds-Waring and De Vane walked together into the town.                         ':*? When we first love, a new glory seems to overspread   f the face of nature. The soul invests every object with its ;! own hue; the heavens above and the earth beneath, yield  : us their sympathy; and hope sheds a glow, surpassing the  i splendor of tropical sunlight, over all the future. De  .1:: Vane thought he had never beheld a season so lovely.    :: The autumnal glories which met his view; the leaves just : changing their hues under the early frost; the lingering  : roses which breathed their fragrance upon the pure air; the songs of birds that never deserted the spot where they -a uttered their first notes in spring for a milder climate, even : :: in winter-all made the little world about him seem a far  : brighter region than the happy valley of Rasselas. "Waring," said he, "you were to take me to see Miss Wordsworth's school; shall we go there now?"   -    A Waring smiled. "Why, De Vane," said he, "this is a   -- holiday, and we shall not find Miss Wordsworth there."  ;: "Still," said De Vane, "I should like to see the place . (42)               X   DE. VANE.          43 where she spends her days. How is it that she can bring herself to submit to such drudgery-?" "I shall answer you as Philip did, when Nathanael asked him if any good thing could come out of Nazareth: Come and see."' In the eastern part of the town, not very far from the public garden, which De Vane had already visited in com- pany with Waring, there was another, covering some two acres of ground, inclosed with a neat fence, inside of which was a hedge of wild orange-trees, that shut in -the grounds from observation. The two students entered the gate, and found themselves in the midst of evergreens, so rich and profuse, that De Vane felt as if he had been suddenly transported to the tropics. I Hardy flowers--such as re- quired little cultivation-bloomed still, and a few rare ones were seen protected by the vigorous shrubbery near them. Winding walks led through the grounds, neatly kept, and they converged upon a central spot, where a small edifice, in the cottage style, stood. The main build- ing was a framed structure of two stories, with a wing on either -end, and with light piazzas connecting with the porch of the principal house. Creepers covered it almost completely, the ivy climbing to the very top of the chim- neys, and waving its branches like little banners. A broad gravelled walk passed fiuite around the house, cutting it off like an island from the -surrounding garden. As the students approached the house, they met an old, respect- able-looking black man, with a rake in his hand, who at once recognized Waring, and evidently regarded him as a friend. "How are you this morning, Uncle Jacob?'" exclaimed Waring. "Thank the Lord, Master Waring," said the old man, taking off his hat, "I'm well; and I hope I sees you well, too."     "         DE VANE.  "Yes, thank you," said Waring; " and I have brought  i my young friend here to see the school. He's from Vir  - ginia." "Mighty glad to see him," ' said the old man; "I'm from Virginny, too." "Are you, indeed, Uncle Jacob?" said De Vane heart- : ily; " then I'm your countryman, and we must get to be good friends." Old Jacob was highly gratified, and he bowed very humbly to the young gentleman, scraping his foot under him as he bent his head low. "Is Mrs. Greene at home?" asked Waring. "Oh! yes, master, and my Missis, too," said Jacob. "What! is Miss Wordsworth here? Why, Uncle Ja-  cob, it's Saturday-don't she give holiday?"      : "Yes, master; but she comes sometimes Saturday, too; ^ and she fetched a little girl with her to-day, that an't X been here before."                  ! Bidding the old man good morning, the gentlemen walked directly to the house.             ! "That old negro," said De Vane, "is thoroughly well- I bred."  "Yes," replied Waring, "I have often observed it; he belongs to Miss Wordsworth--was one of her father's slaves-and is now a sort of patriarch. She keeps him  -t employed here in looking after the grounds; and he is as ' happy as the days are long."              . "(His language is good," said De Vane; " and he seems : I to be as humble as if he had never been indulged." "Yes, he loves his young mistress-thinks himself too . happy in being permitted to serve her; and he is a Christ- -a ian."  By this time they had reached the house. Waring   : knocked at the door, and it was opened by the little girl X who had accompanied Esther to the book-store. She   DE VANE.          45 looked up into Waring's face with a bright smile, and asked him to walk in. "How are you this morning, Mary?" said Waring, stooping to kiss the child. "Do you not remember this gentleman?" "Oh! yes, sir; I saw him with you at the book-store." De Vane took her hand, and thanked her for not having forgotten him. They entered the little hall of the cottage; and Mary, throwing open the door of the room on the right, invited them to follow her. As they entered, they found Esther seated on a low chair, two or three little girls standing by her,and a still smaller child seated on-a cushion at her feet; a bright fire blazed on the hearth, neat, simple fur- niture was arranged in the room tastefully, and chintz curtains hung from the windows; a middle-aged, respect- able-looking woman stood near the group. It was a pic- ture which De Vane never ceased to remember; a picture hung forever in the chamber of his memory, and which he would not have exchanged for Raphael's master-piece, or Claude Lorraine's che f d'euvres. Esther turned her face quickly toward the gentlemen as she heard their tread on the floor, and a glow overspread her face, rising to her very temples; her attitude was one of perfect grace; and De Vane felt that nothing in the whole range of classical mythology, neither nymph nor goddess, could rival her as she sat startled, and for a To- ment moveless; the profuse curls falling from her up- lifted face, the lips parted, and the eyes flashing with an earnest glance. "We owe you an humble acknowledgment of our rude- ness in trespassing upon you, Miss Wordsworth," said Waring; "but we did not know until we entered your grounds that we should find you here." De Vane said notching, but bowed very lo6w. Esther     "          DE VANE. rose and shook hands with them, and expressed her grati fication at their visit. "I am pleased, Mr. Waring, to see that you and your   - friend feel any interest whatever in my little retreat. I -a am not usually here on Saturday, but came to-day to bring a new pupil." She then introduced the gentlemen to Mrs. Green- "my assistant," as she said graciously, " in the task of taking care of these little people." She turned to the girl, who still kept her seat on the cushion, and taking her hand, raised her to her feet. She was a child of great beauty, apparently some six years of age, whose dark eyes and glossy black curls presented a perfect contrast to those of the friend who had just brought her from her desolate home to this "retreat," as she named it.                       : "You remember, Mr. De Vane, do you not, that you .  ?i heard at Mrs. Springfield's-a very painful narrative of a r sudden death, and of a little girl left without parents, or a near relative in all the world? Well, this is the child. X Her mother died about six weeks since, and last Thurs-  :: : day her father, a youug man of excellent character, while "^ standing upon a scaffold, fell backward and was instantly  killed. This was the only child, and I have brought her here, that she may be cared for. I was just taking leave of her as you entered, having brought about her some two or three little girls, who will try to make her happy." She added not a word, but invited the gentlemen to walk through the grounds with her. De Vane's astonish-  , ment could- not be expressed. That one so young, so bright, so accomplished, so full of sympathy with all that was beautiful in nature, in books, in the living world, could pass so many hours in the. task of instructing little girls how to read, to write, to sing-he could not comprehend. Hie could imagine a lady of fortune bestowing her ample ';.   DE VANE.          47 means in charity-in founding a hospital-or in establish- ing a school, and in employing 'others to take the drug- ery of the benevolent scheme; but that the brightness of one's own youth should be surrendered to this repulsive labor, was a scale of self-sacrifice he had not contemplated. His love deepened almost into reverence; and he followed her steps silently as she walked with Waring in advance of him. Reaching a    spot somewhat lower than the level upon which the house' stood, they came to a spring of water which bubbled out of the gravelly slope, and emp- tied into a small marble basin. Trees of larger growth than those in other parts of the grounds sheltered the spot, and broke the fiery splendors of even a Southern mid-day sun. To-day, the clear sunshine glancing through the trees, imparted to them variegated lights and shad- ows; and the view of the higher grounds was as if an art- ist of surpassing skill had spread the rich tapestry of the looms of France over them. Seats were ranged around the spring, and the party resting upon them surveyed the limited but exquisite landscape. "I wonder, Miss Wordsworth," said De Vane, " that I never discovered this enchanted spot before; its loveliness would have tempted me to visit it often." "Do you love nature?" asked Esther. "Earnestly, passionately," said De Vane. "In the primeval forests of Virginia I have learned -almost to wor- ship her." "It is a taste in which I fully sympathize; and I have striven here to shut out the sights and sounds which dis- turb the perfect repose of nature." ' Feeling, I suppose, with Cowper that 'God made the country, but man made the town.' You wish to Spread here, at the very base of this gay capi- tal, the triumphs of nature."     48          E. E VANXT "Yes," said Esther, "I have an intenser consciousness  : of the presence of God in the midst of trees and flowers than I can have here in the streets, or even in the houses about us. Do you recall Thomson's lines? 'The love of nature works, And warms the bosom, till, at last, sublimed . To rapture and enthusiastic heat, We feel the present Deity, and taste The joy of God to see a happy world!"'  "When very young," replied De Vane, "I learned to love Thomson; for my youth was passed in the country, and I observed the seasons, as we study the human face; and the descriptions which he gives might, many of them, have been written in the presence of our own landscapes. Albemarle, Miss Wordsworth, is unrivalled for its scen- ery."' "So I must believe from what I have heard of it from others, but I have not yet seen that part -of Virginia. Passing over the Piedmont road, and entering the mount- ain range of Southern Virginia, I have been deeply im- pressed with the grandeur of the scenery."  "You must not concede, Miss Wordsworth," said War-  ing, " that Virginia has all the fine scenery in the country. The State pride of my friend is already too great, and  we must bring that down, if we can not level his boasted mountains."  De Vane smiled, and asked: "Where, short of Niagara, is there any such scenery?" "On the French-Broad," replied Waring, " to say noth- ing of Upper Georgia, with its waterfalls second only to  Niagara."  "The French-Broad!" exclaimed De Vane. "I never  saw it, but surely its scenery can not rival ours."  "The scenery along the banks of the French-Broad is wonderfully fine. Set out in the morning from the warm   DE VANE.           49 springs of North-Carolina, and make the day's travel to Ashville, and you will be amazed and bewildered. The river cuts its way through mountains. They rise in steep precipices hundreds of feet above it on both sides, fringed with laurel and variegated shrubbery to the very summit. Much of the road is made by cutting away the solid rock, and the wheels of your carriage actually dip in the stream on the one side, while they scrape the mountain-rock on the other side." "I must at some time seeit," said Esther. "I did not suppose that any thing so wild could be found in our southern country." "Such scenery in Europe," replied Waring, " would at- tract thousands of travelers from remote parts, and would be world-renowned."1 The gentlemen, after some further conversation, rose tto take leave of Esther, who invited them to visit her grounds, as often as it might be agreeable to them to do so. De Vane assured her of the pleasure it would afford him to avail himself of her gracious invitation; and, bow- ing low to her, followed Waring, who had already pre- ceded him in the walk. When they were once more in the streets, De Vane put his arm in that of Waring, and said: "I must understand all this. What does it mean, Waring?" "What?" replied the other. What is there that you do not understand?" "When I first, met Miss Wordsworth, you told me she was a Methodist. Afterward I learned she was a teacher. To-day I find that she has established a home for friendless little girls, and that she passes the greater part of her time there. Why should one so young, so bright, so qual- ified to adorn society, give so much of her time to such tasks?" Waring walked on for some   minutes before he spoke; lhe then said: "De Vane, I respect you. Allow me to     50    -DE VANE. say, I know your high qualities, and am sincerely your friend. But I am a friend also to truth. You admire Miss  Wordsworth, that is plain; but you can not appreciate g her. Your aristocratic tastes and habits unfit you for it; you are incapable of self-denying labors, except such as ambition prompts; and you are unable to comprehend how a young, bright, joyous nature can unostentatiously seek to do good, following the humble, the poor, and the  outcast into their revolting abodes, that she may rescue and save them. The whole philosophy of Miss Words- worth's life is to be found in the simple obedience of child- like faith: 'If any man will be my disciple, let him take up his cross daily, and follow me.' " De Vane was touched. He felt that Waring's rebuke   i was not unjust, and he knew it was not intended to be harsh. He had almost shrunk from Esther, when he learned that she was a Methodist. He was shocked when he supposed that she was a teacher; and but for the casual meeting at the book-store, where he discovered the extra-  ordinary wealth of her mind, he might not have sought to know more of her. And even now, when he had dis- covered that she did not teach from any reference to pecu- niary reward, but solely under the influence of a high sen- timent, he felt that he could not sympathize with that sen- timent, however much he respected it, and he feared that her virtues were of too severe a cast. He scarcely knew  how to answer Waring, but he said frankly:       ^' "I may not be able to feel the dominion of a great reli- f gious principle, or the ascendency of a purely religious sentiment, as Miss Wordsworth does, or as you do, War- ing; but still I must revere the principle, and admire the  sentiment, as I do whatever is really noble." "Miss Wordsworth," said Waring, " is a very uncom- : mon person. You, of course, see her beauty, and are im- j pressed with her extraordinary intellectual qualities; her  training has been such as to give her a range of thought -             A1! ; I!   DE VANE.          51 and of sentiment quite out of the line which you have been accustomed to observe. Her parents, as you already know, are both dead, her mother surviving her husband but a short time. When she felt the approach of death- still conscious and resolute-she called for writing mate- rials, and addressed a letter to her child. She impressed on her young mind, even then-and the impression deep- ened with every year as she grew, and read, and re-read the dying message-the importance of living for others. And she enjoined it upon her not to squander the ample fortune which she would inherit upon false objects, but to devote much of it to the training of orphan little girls, without father or mother, like herself, in the way to heaven. That as her father had died young, giving his life a sacrifice for those whom Christ had bought with his own blood; and as she, her mother, was about to follow him to a world of bliss, it was her duty to carry out their wish- es in consecrating herself in some good measure while yet young, to active ministrations, for the good of those who like herself in orphanage, were not like her in fortune. She has faithfully followed the counsels of her saintly mother. She will not consent yet to commit to others the entire care of these young beings; and while she has es- tablished this home, which you have seen to-day, out of her abounding means, and employed a trustworthy person, Mrs. Green, to take charge of them, she will teach them herself. Otherwise she would be but giving of her abund- ance, but it would be no consecration of herself."  "It is glorious," exclaimed De Vane. "I begin to com- prehend how the woman that brought the alabaster box) of precious ointment to anoint the head of the Saviour,' not content with that costly sacrifice, poured the richer tribute of her tears upon his feet, and wiped them witlhr  the hairs of her head."  Waring turned upon him a face beaming with satisfac-. . tion, but said not a word.     CHAPTER VI. "THE vague but manly wish to tread the maze Of life, to noble ends." AUBREY DE VERE. NOVEMBER came; the closing examination of the Senior Class was very near, and De Vane plunged into his studies - deeper than ever. He would not indulge himself in a sin- ! gle visit to Esther. He loved, and loved profoundly, but  ambition swayed him in these closing weeks of his college e career, and love stood by, waiting for the day of his deliv-  erance.                         i The day at length came. The examination was passed, and De Vane was awarded a diploma, and an honor; not  ? so high an honor as he had hoped for. But he felt that - ;3 his course had been irregular; that he had given to some branches of study greater attention than he had bestowed :? on others, and that there were those in the class who, a taking the whole course, excelled him. In some of his  : studies he was peerless; and as these were his favorite ( studies, he was satisfied. Then, too, he had the Valedic- : tory of his Society to deliver, and this soothed him-  cheered him indeed-for it was a great distinction, being X conferred by the students themselves, who were his peers. ? The highest honor was given to Waring, and at this De  X Vane rejoiced. Congratulating his friend, De Vane sought Professor Niles, and urged him to prevail on the X Faculty to excuse him from preparing an oration for Com- (52)   DE VANE.          53 mencement-day, as he had to appear in the evening to de- liver his Valedictory. His request was granted. Relieved now from the pressure of College duties, the whole tide of his nature flowed with impetuous current toward Esther. He sat down and wrote to Mrs. De Vane, giving her a full account, of his course as a student, and requesting his aunt to obtain his father's consent for him to remain where he was, that he might enter the office of Mr. Clarendon, and sthdy the law. In his letter he could not omit some mention of Esther, and of Mr. and Mrs. Springfield, describ- ing them in language sufficiently glowing to interest his aunt, while he made no revelation of his love. He wrote also to his father, limiting himself to an expression of his wish to read law in the office of Mr. Clarendon, and de- scribing him as a Virginian, a rising man, a brilliant or- ator, and an accomplished gentleman. The Legislature assembled; eminent men from all parts of the State coming to the capital, to sojourn during the brief but brilliant session, which did not usually transcend four weeks. The Governor was elected-a gentleman of wealth and great worth, residing at the capital-and a day was fixed for his inauguration. Waring was too much engrossed in preparing his speech for Commencement to attend, inter- esting as the event always was, and much as he respected the Governor-elect; so that De Vane went to the State- House alone. It was thronged; floor and galleries were densely packed. De Vane made his way into the lobby of the Representative Hall, and was standing near the door, when Mr. Clarendon saw him, and bowed to him.  He was standing at the end of a sofa, upon which three ladies were. seated, and De  Vane recognized Esther as one of them. Ie observed Mr. Clarendon speak to her; she turned her face, saw De Vane, and bowed. He felt the "blood rush     DE VANE. through his Veins wildly, and his frame almost shook with emotion. They had not met since the hour they had passed in her garden; and he did not, until this moment, when he saw her once more, comprehend her absolute power over him when he was in her presence. It was -as if he approached the shrine of some celestial being, who spread around the sacred spot an enchantment too potent to be resisted. Yielding to an impulse which he could not : resist, he made his way through the crowded lobby to the - sofa where she was seated. Mr. Clarendon extended his hand to him, in welcome. "Gallantly done, sir," said he. "I applaud your spirit, : and think you have won your spurs."  De Vane smiled, and bowing very low to Esther, said:  :: ' It has been so long, Miss Wordsworth, since I met you, L. that I could not deny myself the pleasure of coming to you, even through such obstructions."    : "L am very much pleased to see you, Mr. De Vane," she replied, raising her sincere, soul-lit eyes, while a glow ; overspread her face. "You have been so engrossed with  : your studies, I learn, that you denied us the gratification  of seeing you. So Mr. Waring informed us."  "Ah! Waring is a generous fiiend, and he has been -. studying to some purpose," he said; "he bears away the  X great prize."                    .  :3 "Yes; but he says that he is not sure you were not en- titled to it; he speak. of you with enthusiasm." "I suspect, Mr. De Vane," said Mr. Clarendon, " that Hi you resemble me somewhat-if you will allow me to say so. You yielded'to your tastes, and pursued such studies ! with ardor as gratified them." "' You are quite right, sir; nor do I regret it. Waring's thorough scholarship, however, fairly entitled him to the distinction which he obtained, against all possible compe- : tition."?'   DE VANE.          55 "My friend, Professor Niles," said Mr. Clarendon, "was strongly disposed to place you at the head of the class, as I happen to know." The two ladies seated by Esther listened eagerly to the conversation. One of them was Mrs. Clarendon, a splen- did woman, of marvelous beauty. Her hair was very dark chestnut, and her eyes so deeply blue, that they might in shadow be mistaken for black. Above the medium height, her person was disposed to fullness, and yet her form was rounded and graceful. The traces of declining health could be seen in her fine face, slightly touched with sadness. The other was the wife of a Senator from the sea-board. She was a blonde; her blue eyes, and light hair, which floated about her face in soft curls, gave her the appear- ance of extreme youth. She was almost fragile, and yet animated, and very lovely. Still De Vane felt that Esther was peerless, and he yielded her from the depths of his soul, a homage more intense than that which Eastern idol- atry pays to its divinity. A gun was heard, announcing the arrival of the Gov- ernor, and the- ladies started, as the windows shook with the reverberation. A burst of music followed; and pre- sently the Governor, with his attendants, entered, and the Speaker, in his blue silk gown, met him, conducted him to the platform, and the usual forms of the inauguration followed. When they were ended, De Vane accompanied Esther, following Mr. Clarendon, who  escorted the two ladies. The carriage was drawn up   near the entrance to- the grounds, and the three ladies entered it and drove away. Mr. De Vane," said Mr. Clarendon, "you must not leave us. What do you propose to do with yourself?" "It is my wish, sir," said he, " to remain here and read law.  I have written to Virginia, asking my father's per- mission to do so."     56          DE VANE. V AE "I am very glad to hear it," replied Mr. Clarendon.  - "Why not come into my office?"             Be "It is just what I propose to do, Mr. Clarendon, if my father should approve my plans."             w "This is the place for you," said the other, taking out of his pocket a very handsome snuff-box, and offering the fragrant tobacco to De Vane; " this is the very place for you. With your tastes, and, I shall add, your talents, you will find here an ample field." De Vane bowed. "I prefer it to Virginia, taking all things into the ac- count, and so will you."  He fixed his eyes upon De Vane's face, looked at him steadily for a minute, and then, lifting his hat, took leave of the young student with a bow of stately grace. De Vane was fascinated. Attentions from eminent men are very grateful to the young, the ardent, the ambitious. : It is delightful to be appreciated, especially by great souls; . and the young student, full of noble and generous qualities A himself, yielded to the grand nature of the man who hadjust . i turned away from him, the tribute of boundless admiration. i i "Mehercutle! Waring," said he, rushing into his apart- i: ment upon reaching the College," what a magnificent man Clarendon is i!"                 . "The whole world will soon acknowledge that," said Waring; " but what has happened to make you so enthusi- astic about him just now?"              ? De Vane gave his friend a description of what lad tran-  spired at the capitol--the inauguration, his seeing Miss i Wordsworth, his presentation to the ladies who were with her, and his interview with Mr. Clarendon. "And after all that, you feel it necessary to invoke the ? aid of your friend Hercules, to help you sustain the bur- den of accumulating honors-do you?"     - De Vane laughed. "Ah!" said he, " you know, Waring, :  I never swear."        ..   CHAPTER VII. EAch one of us, perchance, may here, On some blue morn hereafter, Return to view the' gaudy year, But not with boyish laughter: We shall then be wrinkled men, Our brows with silver laden, And thou this glen may'st seek again, But never more a maiden. THOMAS WILLIAM PARSONS. THE College chapel began early in the day to show signs of a great occasion. 1Many seats were already filled. Car- riages dashed through the Campus, bringing new-comers, and crowds of pedestrians made their way across it. Cer- tain reserved seats were guarded by a committee com- posed of students, wearing badges. The stage was car- peted; chairs were placed thickly upon it, and the Presi- dent's black servant, Scipio, (the students added Africanus to his name,) bustled about with an air as important as if the weight of the whole establishment rested on his sable shoulders.   The younger students usually greeted his ; appearance with a shrill whistle; but he was much too I grave to-day to pay the least attention to any such liber- i ties. In the middle of the Campus, in striking contrast to all the surrounding activity and excitement, Dr. Hume's I white mare, Blanche, grazed peacefully, enjoying the lin- gering herbage which survived the mild approach of win- ter. She was well known to the students, who sometimes exercised their skill shaping- her mane and tail to suit their     58          DE VANE. own taste, of which the Doctor never complained and  Blanche seemed unconscious.  Then came the long procession of official persons. It had formed at the State House, and was now entering   ' i the wide western gate of the grounds. The Governor    :': and Trustees, the Senators, the Representatives-all came, the dignitaries wearing their robes of office. As they entered the chapel, the whole audience rose to their feet. The Governor and Trustees ascended the platform and took their seats with the Faculty. 'The scene was a brilliant one. Official persons of the highest dignity laid - : aside their occupations to be present; for it was the policy ? of the State to cheer, by its countenance, as well as foster a by its means, the noble institution, which already was a glory in the midst of it, crowning its brow like a diadem flashing with precious stones. Its graduates, some of them, ': were even now men of renown.              l1 Ladies, too, in their rich and showy attire, made the place radiant; and Mrs. Springfield and Esther were seen ; by De Vane about midway in the chapel, seated by Mrs. Clarendon. Near them were two ladies, one of them,    : who seemed to be about forty years of age, with a com-  i plexion of extraordinary whiteness, and large, dark eyes.  The other was a much younger person, scarcely above   A twenty, and her beauty was imperial. Classical in her whole ; aspect and form, her dark eyes full of lambent fire, and her ^:: rich, black hair, thrown back from the face, worn in a style A quite unlike that of other ladies, she reminded De Vane of X Aspasia in the full glory of her charms. The elder of the - two ladies was dressed in rich mourning costume; the younger wore a dress of black velvet trimmed with lace, ^ and her hat, which was singularly becoming to her, was X of the same material; a diamond buckle, fastening the dark plume on the hat, flashed with every movement of her head. Seated by Waring on the platform, De Vane turned ;   DE VANE.          59 to him, and called his attention to the party of ladies, an:d asked who the persons were, seated on the right of Mrs. Clarendon. He replied that they were unknown to him. A burst of music from the band opened the programme. Then came the orations, Waring leading the way with the salutatory in Latin, which he uttered so as to give full effect to the majesty of the language. After the several- orations were ended, the President rose, and walked to the middle of the platform. He was very short, with a large, finely formed head and intellectual-face; the expression was that of great benevolence. His hair, now gray, had fallen off from the front of the head, leaving the temples bare, and the large zigzag veins on either side of the forehead were visible, through which the blood coursed like lightning. His waddling gait, short stature, and bent form, together with his strikingly intellectual head and face, presented a grotesque blending of different elements, and suggested the grave and ludicrous. The graduating class formed about him. He delivered a brief address to them, marked with practical sense and tinged with politics, handed to each his diploma; and then, the band playing a national air, the audience dispersed. Mrs. Springfield and Esther waited to speak with War- ing, who, with De   Vane by his side, advanced to the ladies, and received their warm congratulations. "Mr. Springfield," said Mrs. Springfield, " was called to the country yesterday, and expected to be here this morn. ing. I know how deeply he will regret the loss of your oration to-day. And, Mr. De Vane, we shall all come to hear you this evening." He bowed very low. "Mr. De Vane well knows," said Esther, "'the interest which my uncle feels in him, and he will certainly join us." "To be appreciated by Mr. Springfield," he replied, is very flattering to me; if I could only approach his stand. ard, I should be most fortunate."     o60       mVDE VANE. The ladies were evidently gratified at this tribute to  one so much admired and beloved by them, for their faces beamed upon the young student. The evening came. The chapel was again filled to its utmost capacity, and brilliantly lighted. The students had evidently exerted themselves to make the evening eclipse the splendor of the morning.  Again Mrs. Springfield and Esther were present, at- tended by Mr. Springfield and Waring, and seated nearer to the stage than n the morning. There, too, was Mr. Clarendon, this time in attendance on the ladies who had attracted De Vane's attention in the-morning. The Faculty were out in force, Professor Niles seated nearest the spot where his young fiiend-was to stand, and his young, beautiful wife, full of animation, sat by his side. The orator was announced. He came forward full of dignity and grace, blending the self-possession of manhood  with the sensibility of extreme youth. A burst of ap-  $ plausp greeted him, (he was a great favorite in the College,)  and he bowed very low in recognition of the tribute.  Every eye was fixed on him; and Esther felt her heart beat quicker than usual. De Vane had never breathed a word of love to her, but it would have been impossible not to see the admiration which his manner toward her -  always revealed when in her presence. She had not ana- lyzed her heart; she was really unconscious of the depth of the interest which she felt in the young student; and  she was ready now to chide herself for the emotion which she experienced. She had never loved; her soul was' as ' - fresh as Paradise before a cloud flitted over it, and from B i those pure lips no sigh had ever been breathed laden with any earthly passion. She became very pale, and feared  that her aunt might observe how deeply she was moved.  "Esther," said Mrs. Springfield4turning to her as the applause died away, "this is enough to spoil our young  Virginian."  ;;i:::i   'DE VANE.         61 She did not reply. The subject of De Vane's oration was Classical Learn- ing. It was a magnificent argument in defence of a generous education. The enriching influence of an ac- quaintance with the works of antiquity was exhibited; and Milton's example and authority were adduced in sup- port of the proposition, that such learning best fitted a man for a high performance of the great tasks of life. The value of common-schools was not underrated; but it was insisted that an exalted training of even a few minds did more toward advancing the progress of our race, than the widest diffusion of the mere elements of knowledge. One illustration was received with rapturous applause. "The rising sun," said the orator, "first gilds the summit of the Alps, and afterward pours his splendors upon the mountain slopes, until, reaching the highest heavens, he bathes the valleys with his broad and fertil- izing beams. So, in the world of letters, the leading minds catch the first glories of humanizing light, and reflect them from their elevated stand-points upon the surround- ing world." The leave-taking, in the closing part of the speech, was in fine taste, characterized by manliness, and yet imbued with sensibility. Deafening applause greeted De Vane as he took his seat; and Professor Niles, rising, was the first to grasp his hand. The other members of the Faculty offered their congratulations, and the leading students rushed forward eagerly, to pay their enthusiastic tribute to their splendid .representative. It was a complete suc- cess-a triumph. "Mr. Waring," said Mr. Springfield, " your young friend must be looked after. Such a mind must be made ac- quainted with something higher than classical learning; he must be brought under the influence of that power in- voked by Milton, whom he seems so much to admire:     62           DE VANE.  'And chiefly thou, O spirit! that dost prefer Before all temples the upright heart and pure, Instruct ime.' He will then learn how   much sublimer are inspired themes than even the most heroic of heathen exploits; for his own great poet is described by Barrow as singing in worthy lines-the war in heaven: 'Stat dubius cui se parti concedat Olympus, Et metuit pugnce ne superesse suce, At simul in coelis Messice insignia fulgent, Et currus animes, armaque digna Deo.' " "Oh!" exclaimed Mrs. Springfield, "it is so fine." Esther said not a word; but the color had returned to her face; for it now glowed--she was radiant. "Yes," said Waring, "I have long known what De Vane can do. His future involves a degree of responsi- bility nothing short of fearful." "Mr. Clarendon was seen to quit the ladies under his  charge, for a moment; and advancing toward De Vane,     0 who had now descended from the stage, and was coming  to where Mr. Springfield and his party stood, he grasped the young student's hand in both his, and said: "I thank you, sir! Every man who loves the classics is indebted to you." De Vane bowed with quiet dignity, but did not attempt to reply. His eyes sought Esther.  She had seen and heard all; and as he reached the group where she stood,  she greeted him with an uncontrollable flash of joyous  sympathy, which sent its radiance into the depths of the  I young student's soul, with as bright a glory as a cloudless  summer morning sheds over a landscape. 9-   CHAPTER VIII. "FFORGIVE me, if I can not turn away From those sweet eyes that are my earthly heaven; For they are guiding stars, benignly given To tempt my footsteps to the upward way; And if I dwell too fondly in thy sight, I live and love in God's peculiar light." COLERIDGE: Michael Angelo. DE VANE'S College course was now ended, and the great world opened before him. There comes in life but one such season. The spring, with its all-vivifying fervor, comes upon nature with each recurring year; but it warms the human heart once, never to revisit it. When its pro- mise deepens into the summer verdure, we look for the matured fruits, and then the autumnal glories, closing with the long, long winter. Letters came to De Vane from home.    His father ap- proved his plans, and expressed his satisfaction at his course. Mr. Clarendon's family were known to him; but he had never met that gentleman-his reputation he was acquainted with-and General De Vane was gratified that his son was to enjoy the advantages, which an intimate association with such a man was sure to yield. He gave him his views, at some length, of public affairs, and looked forward to a complete triumph throughout the country, of his party, at the approaching election for the Presidency.

He denounces the Administration in just terms, and characterizes its abuses in language so (63)     "         DE VANE. severe, that it is thought the leading Cabinet Minister will call him out. I should regret this, for I admire the splendid abilities of that gentleman, nor do I give credence for a moment to the injurious suggestions which are made as to the terms of his obtaining office. His public serv- ices and his statesmanship entitled him to the position preeminently; and I know him too well to believe that he would sully his honor by a corrupt, or even humiliating agreement, in regard to any office. But'I do agree with the strong classical figure which Mr. Randolph employs to describe the state of affairs at Washington. The Augean  stable needs cleansing, and. I think we have the Hercules who will accomplish the task."             :i The letter from his aunt was very long. It gave him the details of home affairs, in which he felt a deep interest, and which Mrs. De Vane recounted with charming fidelity. a His home rose before him: his books, his servants, his horses-all came to view vividly; and he breathed once  more the native mountain air, which had exhilarated his  early youth. Passing to other matters, she wrote: "I observe, my dear George, that you have found new  friends lately, and found them, too, where I should hardly : have looked for them-in the family of a Methodist minis- ; ter. It seems he is not a clergyman, but one of Mr. Wes-  ley's lay preachers. Do not understand me to mean that  I disapprove you seeing such people; but I wish to guard ! you against an intimate acquaintance with them, or an intercourse so frequent as to bring you under their in-  fluence. I do not doubt that very good people are found  among the Methodists. I have known such myself, and some of their preachers are men of great oratorical  power. But a few days since I attended the chapel in our  neighborhood, and heard Bishop McKendree, really a venerable man, and a most eloquent preacher. I was  charmed with him, and under his sermon my tears fill  p:: 'I /l   DE VANE.          65 like rain. He was stopping for two or three days with our friends, the Hamiltons, who are Methodists, you know and as refined and cultivated as any persons of my ac- quaintance; but they are exceptions, you understand, to a rule so general, that I should hardly expect to find another family like them. Your description of Miss Wordsworth I confess, interests me. Such beauty, such culture, such refinement, and such a self-sacrificing spirit, one rarely meets in any circle. But, dear George, have you not a little eleve la vertu de votre sainte? According to your de- scription, she is quite a Saint Cecilia; and Malibran can not rival her. Prenez garde! My George, the illusion which lo)ve sheds around youth and beauty often misleads us. "The Guilfords have just returned from Europe. Clara is wonderfully improved; and she remembers you vividly. I did not venture to inform her of your enthusiastic admir- ation of the young Methodist; it would have been cruel.

DE V." The lights and shadows that flitted over De Vane's face as he read his aunt's letter were like those which we see     "         DE VAINE.             X on a summer landscape, when light clouds fly through the sky. He loved Mrs. De Vane dearly, and respected her  : judgment and taste, and the light way in which she spoke of Esther and her friends disturbed him. The strong feeling  of caste, which was deep in his nature, was roused, and he X felt his patrician tastes powerfully revived by the descrip- tion of the Guilfords, a family of great wealth and of high ancestral pride. Their estate was the largest in Virginia, : and the lands had descended from father to son through  every generation since John Guilford-a younger brother . of an English nobleman--first settled in the country. Clara he well remembered'as a brilliant and attractive girl, dashing fearlessly on her spirited horse over the : mountain-roads; for he had often accompanied her, when she had tasked his horsemanship in leaping ravines, and ' sometimes rail fences. She had now been in England on a '.. visit to her relatives, for the families still kept up a fre- quent intercourse. How resplendent she must be, how  i superbly she would grace the mansion of a gentleman- I sympathizing with all his tastes, and adorning his whole career!  He had walked to the public garden to read his letters, : and he now paced through the broad walks, plunged in thoughts which made him insensible to every thing about him. Turning into one of the less frequented walks, he ; found little Mary Sinclair, seated on one of the'benches, with a book in her hand, and the beautiful child whom De a Vane remembered that he had seen seated at the feet of Esther upon his first visit to her school. They were en- ; joying the warm sunshine which, even on a December   day, bathed the spot where they sat with the temperature of May in less favored climes. Miary knew him instantly, and her face beamed with pleasure as he approached. lRising from her seat, she gave him her hand with the i sweet confidence of innocent childhood, unheeding aristo- ,i  ,.S   DE VANE.          67 cratic distinctions or the world's cold rules. De Va;r was touched, and stooping down, he kissed the bright little cheek before him. She had come at this moment when the great world of state and fashion was spreading its attrac- tions before the eyes of De Vane and shaking its gleaming gifts in lis view, like a bird from some dear retreat which he knew and loved, to make its mute appeal to his better nature. Who has not, by a sight or a sound, been recalled from the dreams of ambition or the schemes of worldliness? The tones of music recall our fresh youth, our early love, our dear loyal friends long since parted and gone, and a glance of loving eyes melts in an instant the frost-work which had been forming about our hearts. Let the Swit- zer wander where he may, the Ranz cdes Vaches brings to his view the loved valleys of his childhood, and nature as- serting her supremacy, he gives the tribute of his tears to the home of his happiest and most innocent, hours. "So you are out to-day, Mary," said De Vane. "Is it a holiday?" "No, sir," replied the little girl; "Miss Esther sent me with Susan to the book-store to get a book which she had promised her, and we were just returning. We stopped here to rest a little while, as Susan can not walk so fast as I do, without becoming tired." "And where is Miss Wordsworth?" "At the cottage," she replied. "Mrs. Green is not very well to-day, and Miss Esther would not leave her till her headache got better. And," she added, " we must now go on, for she will be uneasy if we stay out too long." "Well," said De Vane, "I will go with you." And taking the hand of little Susan, he walked by the side of the child. A few minutes' walk brought them to Esther's I inclosure, and opening the gate, De Vane walked with the  children to the house. Mary Sinclair darted forward, threw open the door, and i     68          DE VANE. announced the approach of Mr. De Vane. Esther sprang ! to her feet and came forward, "blushing like the morn," and saw"De Vane leading little Susan, whose steps could not keep up with Mary Sinclair's, and she felt that never :f! had she seen him when he appeared to such advantage-not  in the hour of his triumph before the assembled College, j  nor when walking amidst his peers, the object of universal admiration. A true man never does attract the higher  qualities of a woman of noble nature so powerfully as when he descends from the sterner ways of life to use his strength in succoring or guiding or protecting the weak; and the picture which Esther saw as De Vane approached, tenderly helping the little child whom he held by the hand to walk as briskly as she desired, was never effaced  from her heart. She smiled brightly, and running to meet them, her long fair hair catching the sunbeams as they fell, and encircling her like a glory, she exclaimed: "Ah! Mr. De Vane, this is very good; you are achiev- ing your highest triumph now, for you are guiding heed-  less little feet in the right path-the path that leads home- :- ward." Tears were in her eyes-those glorious eyes, full of quenchless tenderness, and as De Vane saw her stand- ing thus for a moment as she reached the spot where he  stood, he felt that in her surpassing beauty and goodness she transcended even the visions which his imagination sometimes painted.  He entered the house with Esther, and found the little girls, the objects of her care, seated at their desks, neat and light desks, each one having exclusive jurisdiction  over her own, and rivaling each other in the tidiness with  which they were kept. The whole aspect of the place was cheerful. A small organ stood on one side of the room, used at the morning and evening devotions, in which the ;-  children took part, singing by note, for Esther made music  a part of her system. Engravings-landscapes and cattle i   DE VANE.          69 pieces-adorned the walls, and a light 6tagere held a collec- tion of entertaining books, selected by Esther with care. "Miss Wordsworth," said De Vane, "I begin to com- prehend how you are able to lead this life. You have succeeded in blending the graceful with the good and use- fil in such a way that, an angel, straying from his native home, might pass the days here cheerfully." Esther laughed heartily, and said: "Your tribute to my little cottage, Mr. De Vane, is so beautiful that I must ask you sometimes to visit it. Possibly, if you suffer from ennui, you may find relief here in talking to these little girls, and telling them of the world of knowledge-they have yet to explore." "Much better would it be for me;" he replied, half gayly, half tenderly, " to sit at your feet and learn." "You do me too much honor," said Esther, blushing. "Would you wish to see what your sable friend Jacob has been doing in my grounds within a few weeks? He is an extravagant admirer of you, and while I do not mean to detract in the least from your merits, I suspect that you owe something of his good opinion to your nativity. He thinks that every thing good and great must have some connection with Virginia. My grandfather was from that State, and therefore Jacob extends to me his good opinion, supposing that I possess inherited virtues." De Vane had never known Esther so gay. Excusing herself for a moment, she went out of the room, and pres ently returned with her hat and shawl, accompanied by Mrs. Green, who had recovered from the morning's head- ache, and who greeted De Vane deferentially. "Mrs. Green," said Esther, "I shall not return before to-morrow morning. Good-by." The little girls rose, and stood until Esther quitted the room. Turning iinto a walk which De Vane had not yet explored, she conducted him to a part of the garden ^             \ is     70          DE VANE.             , where the highest skill had been bestowed. Rare plants stood in tropical glory, sheltered by shrubbery, which  protected without overshadowing them; the brilliant pomegranate displayed its beauties, and the luxuriant Cape jessamine shed its fragrance, safe from frosts; roses grew in profusion; birds, lingering where the reign of winter seemed unknown, made the air vocal. "Miss Wordsworth," said De Vane, "has your place yet been named?" "Oh! no," she replied; " it is too simple for such an am- bitious distinction as a name. Parks and country-seats must aspire to such an honor." "I will name it, if you will permit me. Shall I?" Esther bowed. "Let it be called 'LEAsowES,' then-the name of Shen- stone's seat." "Thank you, Mr. De Vane, for your appreciation of my little seat." And from that day it always bore the name of LEA- BOWES.               v  "I should have called it Paradise," said De Vane, "but for the temptation, and the sin, and the expulsion, which are ever associated in my mind with the Eastern garden." Esther looked at him earnestly. A shade of sadness rested for a moment on his features, and he added: "Is it not too sad that since that hour of primeval bliss the world offers no retreat where the circling seasons may be passed, unconscious of the doom that awaits us-the inevitable grave?" "But," said she, "there is a paradise where no shade of sorrow can come, where every joy is immortal, and where we need fear neither sin, nor temptation, nor expul- sion." She spoke with trembling earnestness, and they walked side by side silently. !   DE VANE.          71 "But, Miss Wordsworth," at length said De Vane, "what is to be done to make this world a happy seat? It is so conventional, so imperious in its exactions, so heartless in its estimate of the gopd and the beautiful, that I sometimes wish for some happy valley, like that which shut in the Abyssinian Prince. The shrine of the world is e. cruel one, more so than that of the Mexican Indians, who tore the palpitating heart from the living breast, and offered it to their god as a sacrifice: its throbs soon ceased upon the broad rock where it was placed; but society leaves the heart still to throb on, in the long course of lapsing years, and yet tortures the victim by resisting every true impulse and every natural emotion. In its dread imperiousness, it listens neither to the appeals of youth nor the voice of nature. The Greeks would have sacrificed Iphigenia, in her innocence and beauty, regard- less of her tears and entreaties, had not the relenting god- dess at whose shrine she stood, rescued and saved her; but it was their love of glory that impelled them to the deed. Society brings to its shrine victims that are to be ; sacrificed to- the advancement of pride and selfishness." He spoke with bitterness, and Esther, turning a quick  glance upon his face, saw that it was very stern. She did not comprehend him. She saw that he was in some extra- ordinary mood, that he was unhappy; but she could not  read the mysterious depth of the shadow which had dark- H ened his young and bright spirit. She did not know that i Mrs. De Vane had thrown such temptations in his way, that she had called upon his ardent nature to tear itself away from the sweet and purifying influences which had of late been attracting him. De Vane had been educated to respect the opinions of the world, to value its conven- tionalisms, and to seek its high places-not at the sacrifice of truth or self-respect; but the broad social distinctions of life were made to appear very important; and his rela-     72          DE VANE. tives would doubtless be as much shocked at his taking for ^ a wife a person not strictly of their own caste, as the royal  household are when a king contracts a morganatic mar-   riage. He felt this; and once more in the presence of Es- ther, his spirits rose with indignation against a system c which would rank such a being below its scale, merely  because she adopted a religious creed more evangelical than it recognized, and cast in her lot with a people too fervent in their faith, and too exact in their lives, to please the taste of the votaries of fashion, or the circle which thought, because it was exclusive, it was refined. Esther was silent, and De Vane continued:  "Is all this life to be sacrificed to the future? Is the  glory of this our earthly being to be ignored, that we may attain that Paradise of which you speak, and where  we shall be happy and sinless?"  "Oh! no, Mr. De Vane," she replied. "The highest glory of this life is in perfect harmony with that future glory which awaits the faithful. But we must not follow false i lights; we must not suffer our own hearts to betray us;  we must learn what true glory is."      .   . "Would you condemn fame, and wealth, and power,  Miss Wordsworth?" "I would condemn nothing really noble; but I would not make the attainment of fame, or wealth, or power,  the guiding-star of my course through life. May I remind  you of the words of the Great Exemplar of humanity,  'Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you'?" There was a thrilling tenderness in the tones of her voice, which reached the depths of De Vane's soul. He was deeply affected, and he did not immediately reply. When he did speak, he said:  "Miss Wordsworth, you will pardon me for saying that i I feel as Adam must have felt in the paradise which Mil-   DE VANE.          73 ton describes, when the angel discoursed to him of the world that lay before him: 'The angel ended, And in Adam's ear so charming left his voice.'" Esther blushed deeply. "Mr. De Vane, when do you return to Virginia?" she asked, after walking a few steps in silence. "It may be never," he replied; "I am to enter Mr. Clarendon's office, and I can not read my future." Her e abarrassment deepened; she trembled. At this moment they reached the gate, and she said: Mr. De Vane, I am about to return to Mr. Spring- field's; I am expected there at this hour. Having made a longer stay here than I anticipated, I must beg you to ex- cuse me." "Let me accompany you," said De Vane; " having detained you, I must atone for it by seeing you safely home." Esther smiled, and they walked together to the residence of Mr. Springfield. De Vane took leave of her, and  sought his lodgings. The patrician felt that there was a higher glory than any that the world could give, and he felt too in that hour that he would gladly renounce all the splendor of the realm where society sat supreme, the Sphinx of the modern world, its cold eyes looking to the future, and its dread orm the impersonation of heartlessness and power, to foL ow through the world's vain mask such a guide as had just now turned from him her soul-lit face.

For eloquence, The sea-green sirens taught her voice their flattery; : And, while she speaks, night steals upon the day Unmarked of those that hear." DRYDEN'S Cleopatra. DE VANE had entered the office of Mr. Clarendon, and taken up his course of study. Waring was about to visit  his friends in Georgia, but it was his intention to return,  ; and study for the ministry, availing himself of the use of Mr. Springfield's extensive library, and enjoying that gen-  tleman's instructions. Sincerely attached to De Vane, he   i wished to be near him; and it was his hope that he might   iX contribute somewhat toward bringing the noble nature of his friend under the controlling power of evangelical religion. He was well acquainted with his generous qual-  ities, and he ardently desired to see his imperial intellect submit itself to the teachings of Him who spake as never  man spake. Somewhat bewildered with German specula-      E ] tions, and thoroughly aristocratic in his tastes, there was  much to hinder his coming to the feet of ONE who invited    the weary and heavy-laden to seek him, because he was      t meek and lowly. Yet the love of truth within him was strong, his scorn of the meaner ways of life was intense,    a and he had the courage to avow his sentiments in regard to    h any thing. His nature was too grand to suffer him to sac- rifice himself to false gods, if they could be stripped of the ,  illusion which invested them.  (74)               ,   DE VANE.         75 The two gentlemen were walking in the main street near the State House, when a very handsome English coach, drawn by a pair of splendid horses, dark bays, with black manes and tails, two black servants in livery seated on the box, came dashing by. In the carriage the two ladies were seated, who had attracted De Vane's attention on Commencement day; and as they passed the gentle- men, the younger of the two looked quickly out, as if she desired to observe them. It was but for a moment, and presently the carriage drew up, and the ladies, alighting from it, entered the State House., ali "Waring," said De Vane, "do you know those ladies?" "I do not," he replied; " they must be strangers. The person who leaned from the carriage is verg beautiful; I never saw a finer face." "Brilliant," said the other; "and their equipage is per. bect in its appointments. Those are English horses." Indeed  I share your taste for fine horses, De Vane," aid Waring. "And for fine women, too?" "Cela depend," answered Waring. "I am not easily azzled. I should not choose a woman as I would a orse-for a glossy coat, fine form, and fine action only." "Yet, Waring, you would demand beauty?" - "I do not underrate it, but I should require the intel- ct and the soul to harmonize with the outward form." "As in the case of Cleopatra-.par exemple." "Never," replied Waring, "never. A merely volup- ous, accomplished woman could never ensnare me." "What! not such a woman as enslaved Julius Coesar, d held Mark Antony captive in her gilded saloons, until lost a world?" 'No; for in the society of such a woman I might lose at is worth more than the world," said Waring gravely. they met Mr. Clarendon. "Ah I young gentlemen!" he     76          DE VANE.            i'K exclaimed gayly. "Vous allez ensemble, eh! I am fortu- nate in meeting you, for I was seeking you. The Duke of Saxe-Weimar is here, and we are to entertain him to- morrow evening. The time for preparation is so short  that I must press you both into the service. Mrs. Claren- don has just taken up Miss Wordsworth, and they are now  driving to distribute verbal invitations, there being no  time to prepare cards. You must be good enough to do  the same thing for the gentlemen. Here is a list of chosen names." Waring and De Vane expressed their readiness to serve  him, and took their leave. Mr. Clarendon proceeded to the State House. "The Duke of Saxe-Weimar!" exclaimed De Vane. "I am delighted." "Yes," said Waring, "it will be a rare treat for you-  you are half German. By the way, too, we shall meet eminent political men there. Senator Caldwell is in town,  and he will of course be present."          : "Indeed," replied De Vane. "I shall be gratified to meet him. I am assured that he is brilliant in conver- sation."  "So I learn," said Waring. They called a carriage, and drove to such places as their a instructions required.  Thursday evening came. It was propitious, cloudless, and mild. The moon was too young to afford much light,  but the stars were out in countless hosts.  As Waring and De Vane approached the residence of  Mr. Clarendon, they observed that it was brilliantly light-  ed. In the extensive garden which surrounded the house, lamps were hung from the trees, and the scene was one of surpassing beauty. They entered, and were ushered into  the splendid rooms: the walls adorned with pictures, the works of masters, which had been collected by Mr. Clar-   DE VANE.          " endon in Europe; old armor, busts, elegantly bound books musical instruments, and the nameless objects which give such a charm to houses where taste and genius guide the decorations. Mrs. Clarendon, with Esther by her side, stood to receive the guests, and as the two gentlemen entered, the latter colored a little for an instant, but soon recovered her self- possession, and welcomed them gracefully. Her dress was in perfect harmony with her style of beauty; simple, rich, and fitted to her shape, so as to show the form to advan- tage, without being in the extreme of fashion. She wore no jewelry, except a diamond ring, of extraordinary bril- liancy, but in her hair natural flowers were braided. The rooms were rapidly filling, and De Vane, after exchanging a few words with Esther, passed on to where Mr. Claren- don stood, surrounded by some half-dozen gentlemen. One of these was a striking-loolking person, short, stoutly built with a grand head. His features were large, the lips some- what sensuous, the tout ensemble pleasing. He was a mem- ber of the House of Representatives from the largest city in the State, and a man of mark.  Both as a speaker and writer, he was distinguished for the richness and power of his style. He had travelled with Mr. Clarendon in E urope and they admired each other. De Vane was presented to him, and he expressed his gratification at meeting the young gentleman, saying that he heard his speech in the College chapel, and was so much pleased that he had been wishing for the opportunity to tender his congratulations. Your vindication, sir, of classical learning," said he "does you great credit." De Vane thanked him warmly, saying that    Commenda- tion from such a source was most gratifying to him. At this moment the Duke of Saxe-Weimar entered, and came directly to where Mr. Clarendon was  standing.  He was gigantic in stature, broad-shouldered, with enormous     78          DE VANE.             l hands and feet, a beaming, intellectual face, and a certain  grace in his movements. He wore glasses, and looked altogether like a man of culture.            i  He was presented to the gentlemen grouped about him, and he entered into animated conversation w ith them, ill which the leading part was borne by the eminent man who had just addressed himself to De Vane. Waring came up, and touching De Vane's shoulder, invited him to accompany him to the front drawing- room. As they entered it, they saw the two ladies who had attracted their attention the day before in their car- . riage, standing in the centre of the room, in conversation with Mrs. Clarendon. The younger lady was of such re- splendent beauty, that she was dazzling. Her rich, dark hair, turned back from the face, was gathered in heavy / braids, through which pearls were intertwisted; and her large, lustrous eyes, shaded by the long lashes, were full f of sentiment-a sentiment too pure for passion, and not e sad enough for sorrow-fascinated those on whom they rested. Her finely-moulded arms were as perfect as if  Y chiseled from marble, and her attitude was the imper- ; : sonation of grace. Her costume was brilliant. The dress, of purple velvet, trimmed with black Brussels lace, fell in - rich folds about her person, which was scarcely taller than - that of Esther, but more matured. She wore diamond   : bracelets, set in enamel; a diamond necklace to match, and i a single ring, in which a diamond of large size flashed.  . "De Vane," said Waring, "Mrs. Clarendon wished you - to be presented to the ladies with whom she is conversing." "Iehercule I Waring," replied De Vane," what a superb ' -'  woman!"  "She is very brilliant," replied the other.    ! X De Vane advanced, and was presented by Mrs. Claren- don to the two ladies, Mrs. Habersham and Miss Godol- phin. Waring had already enjoyed that honor, and enter-   g             DE VANE.           9 ed into conversation with Mrs. Habersham, a stately but St aagreeable lady. " ou must have come to us but recently, Miss Godol. phin," said De Vane, " or I should have met you, surely." ::-  "I came only last week," she replied, "but I have not been ignorant of you, Mr. De Vane. I met in Switzerland, a few months since, the Guilfords, of Virginia, who spoke of you, and told me that you were here at college, and I had the pleasure of hearing your valedictory." ! De Vane acknowledged the compliment with a low bow. You are, then, quite lately from Europe," he said.  I had learned that the family of which you speak had re- turned, through my aunt, Mrs. De Vane." "They corresponded with her while abroad, and I felt upon coming home-for this is my home--that I almost knew you personally."' De Vane felt gratified at her gracious interest in him. So brilliant, so attractive, so commanding, that she should honor him with her regards was indeed a distinction. When on the threshold of manhood, attentions from a wo- man of our own age, or somewhat above it, if she be love- ly and accomplished, have a peculiar charm for us. They please, while they flatter our amour propre. "I am most fortunate," said De Vane, " in having been favorably reported to you, before meeting you." "Yes," she answered, "and you must allow me to say that, having heard your speech, I feel myself indebted to the friends who prepared me for such a performance. I love the classics, Mr. De Vane, nor do I think there is any thing in modern literature which can rival them." "And which of the  works which have come down to us from the golden ages do you prefer?" "Oh! Homer, of course." "Indeed, do you find him more agreeable than Virgoil?" "A thousand times more so," she replied. "He is he. roic, and he does justice to woman,"     80          DE VANE.  "How?" said De Vane, smiling. "In making the charms of Helen inflame the world with war, and bring destruc-  tion upon Troy?" "Not at all," she answered. "Helen was not worthy of such deeds, wrought in her behalf. It was to Mene- laus a calamity that he succeeded in winning her. But in Andromache and Penelope he vindicates our sex.  "And how does Virgil offend you?" inquired De Vane. "By representing Dido as dying of grief, because for- saken by Zneas-a most unworthy passion; for he was not a hero. Had he been, I might have pardoned her." "Then, too, she had loved before," said NV aring, who i had for some minutes been standing, with Esther on his  arm, in silence. Miss Godolphin flushed to the temples, turning to the speaker with a glance which seemed to seek to read his  soul. She did not reply. "Do you think it possible," said De Vane, that AEneas really loved the Carthaginian queen?" "No," said Miss Godolphin. "If he had loved, how could he forsake her?" There was the deepest sadness in her tone, and a shadow came over her face.  "The love of glory," said De Vane," impelled him to spread his sails, and she could no longer detain him. "How was it, then," she replied, "that Cleopatra held  Antony? What do you say, Miss Wordsworth?" Esther started. "I think," she said, "that Antony was true to neither Octavia nor Cleopatra. If he had loved either, he would have been loyal, and his ambition would a have yielded to his better nature."  De Vane was astonished. Here stood a young girl, scarcely seventeen, and yet she had solved a problem which the world was discussing, with so true a judgment  that all who heard her yielded to it. F   DE VANE.          81 "You are right," said Miss Godolphin. "Antony was incapable of love. The ruling passion was the love of glory, and no tender sentiment can live in its fierce blaze. Hector was a hero, but he would never have deserted An- dromache, save to defend her against the invading Greek! See with what tenderness he takes leave of her and em- braces his boy." There was a wild, passionate sadness in her tones which ,touched the hearts of the group about her. She might herself have been some queen, standing in her superb beauty, sad at desertion, and yet conquering it by pride. What a contrast Esther presented! Her glorious beauty was that of youth unsaddened by a shade of infelicity. Her brilliant complexion, her auburn hair, her deep-blue eyes, with heaven mirrored in their clear depths, her sylph- like form, and her perfectly-chiseled features, over which no cloud of earthly sorrow had ever darkened, constituted a combination of charms at once pure and glowing. As they stood near each other, they seemed the impersonation of Night and Morning, both gloriously beautiful: the one adorned with the stars of evening for a diadem; the other decked with dewy flowers, which the burning rays of the sun had not yet kissed. The one brilliant, like Ariadne, her crown flashing from her brows after the desertion of Theseus; the other like Iphigenia ih her innocence, pure enough to minister in the temple of Diana. "I quite agree with you," said Waring, " that the love of glory must be subdued before we see any of the objects of life in their true proportions. There is something in our nature grander than ambition-the love of truth, for the sake of truth. It is ignoble to live for human ap- plause. It is glorious to seek, amidst the illusions of life, the path which leads to a realm whose shadows are lost in all-revealing light. 4*     82          DE VANE. Miss Godolphin looked at him earnestly. "And how," said she, "are we to find that path in the bewildering : mazes about us?" "It is marked by foot-prints," replied Waring, "that lead us unerringly."  At this moment Mr. Clarendon entered the room with the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, and the gentleman who had been in conversation with him. They all came to where Miss Godolphin was standing, and the gentlemen were in- troduced to the party.                i "You have just returned from Europe, I learn," said the Duke. "Were you in Germany?" "Yes," replied Miss Godolphin, "and in Weimar." C Ah! and were you pleased?" "I could not be otherwise," she answered. "It well deserves its name, the ATHENS of Germany." The Duke bowed low. Miss Godolphin continued: "'The tone of society is charming. Nature and genius conspire to make the place attractive. Such gardens I never saw. The theatre is classical, and the scholars entertaining. What more can r one want on earth?"                 X The conversation now became general. The Duke asked Esther if she admired the works of his countrymen, and she replied: "Such of them as are known to me possess a certain charm, but I can not judge them critically." "Mendelssohn, for instance?"           a "Do you speak of the younger," said she.     ' "Oh! no-Moses, the author of Phwedon." "I admire his fine spirit," said Esther, " but I must la. i ment his blindness in refusing to acknowledge the Re- . deemer."  The Duke bowed. "Then," said the gentleman who stood by his side,   DE VANE.    X      83 whose fine head Esther had observed with admiration, "you may like Wieland?" "I admire him," she answered, " but fear that his ideal of moral beauty was not that of the Christian believer." "I am not by any means sure of that," said the gentle- man. "His father was a Lutheran divine, and his tutor deeply imbued with the spirit of religion; and in his Dia- logues of the Gods, it would seem that he intended in the words of the Unknown to pay a tribute to Christianity as the only system which can remodel men." Waring was delighted. "I must now thank you," said De Vane, " for your vin- dication of one of the most agreeable of all writers." 1"I must confess my admiration for Leasing," said Miss Godolphin. "His love of the beautiful was intense; he was not misled by the French taste, but made his countrymen acquainted with the creations of the ancients and the moderns--of the Greeks and of Shakespeare." Mr. Clarendon's face beamed. "Allow me, Miss Godol- phin," he said, " to thank you;" and with his hand upon his breast, he made her a stately bow. The conversation continued. The merits of Goethe, of Schiller, of Herder, and of Jean Paul Richter were dis- cussed. "Upon my soul," exclaimed the Duke, "I can fancy my- self at Weimar. . Nowhere in this country have I found any thing like this before." De Vane had fascinated him by his enthusiasm, and the: acquaintance of the others with the literature of his coun- try had been unexpected.  A party of gentlemen who had been dining together now entered, and among them Senator Caldwell, accom- panied by Professor Locke and Professor Niles.  The Senator's appearance was striking. Tall, almost slender, erect, with features distinctly chiseled, and eyes that     84           DE VANE.  blazed, he was the impersonation of intellectual power.  Soon after his entrance, the conversation turned upon metaphysics, and the Senator engaged in it with ardor, finding in Professor Locke an antagonist who drew out all ^ his power. His whole faculties were engaged, and his profound analytical power displayed itself in the most captivating way. "What do you say to that, Le Grande?" he at length said, addressing himself to the gentleman whose short stature and intellectual appearance had already attracted the attention of De Vane; and from that time he, together with Mrs. Clarendon, took part in the discussion, which was only interrupted by the notes of the piano: some hand of surpassing skill was touching its keys, and the gentle- men all gathered about the performer. Miss Godolphin was seated at the instrument, and was playing a piece of German music which had just appeared. Her execution was brilliant. After the piece was ended,  : Professor Niles asked her to sing. A shade of sadness  touched her features, but after a moment's hesitation, she sang Moore's beautiful lines:                - "I saw from the beach, when the morning was shining,  A bark o'er the waters move gloriously on; I came to that beach when the sun was declining- The bark was still there, but the waters were gone!" She sang the entire lines, in tones of wild, passionate, almost wailing sadness, until she uttered the words, "Give me back, give me back the wild freshness of morning!" : when she threw an energy into them which was startling. An irrepressible burst of applause followed. Her glove  had fallen, and as De Vane stooped to hand it to her, he observed that tears were in her eyes. She rose, and turned away.  i   :i     DE VANE.              85 Mrs. Niles was prevailed on to sing. She took her seat, touched the keys with the skill of an artiste, and sang a song which had just been set to music by a royal hand- "Partant pour la Syrie." The Duke was charmed. He had heard it in Europe, and he exclaimed: "You know that the composer is in exile. Sad that the enemies of the peace of Europe should bring misfortunes upon such a spirit!" Mr. Clarendon turned to Esther, and taking her hand, seated her at the instrument. She was pale, but she offered no remonstrance. She felt how very trying the ordeal was through which she was about to pass, for her own know-. ledge of music disclosed the faultless performance of those who had preceded her. She ran her fingers over the keys lightly, and then played a selection from Felix Mendels- sohn Bartholdy's "Walpurgisnacht," and sang a transla- tion of the words of Goethe. The effect was magical, the power of the music rose into sublimity. Miss Godolphin seemed breathless with emotion, and the Duke was enthu- siastic in his applause; his great hands, hid in white kid gloves, made the room echo, while'his Bravo! Bravo'. rang like a trumpet. De Vane could not utter a word, but his excitement was so visible, that Mr. Clarendon smiled as he saw his earnest face and compressed lips. Es- ther's form had seemed to be swept by the power of the music; her face wore a glory that was caught from the in- spiration of the moment, and when the keys were silent, her faultless hands were clasped unconsciously before her. Never had De Vane witnessed such enthusiasm in her be- fore; she was like a sibyl absorbed by the revelation of her own faculties. Waring spoke to rr, and asked her to add a single song more. "What shall it be?" said Esther. "Any thing which you may select," he replied.     86          DE VANE.  She sang those lines in which the genius of Moore seemed under the influence of heavenly inspiration- "O Thou who driest the mourner's tear!" Her voice almost trembled with sensibility, and as the dying cadence was lost in the air, the sympathy of the company was so deep and their taste so appreciative, that not a word was uttered. She rose from the instrument, and Miss Godolphin, ad- vancing, took her hand in both her own, and said: "Miss Wordsworth, I thank you for interpreting music to me in a way which makes me feel its glory.' "Such a tribute from you, Miss Godolphin," said Mr. Clarendon, "my young friend may well prize." "I prize it very highly, Mr. Clarendon," said Esther. Some one proposed that they should visit the lighted gar- den. De Vane gave his arm to Esther, and they walked out, followed by Wariiig and Miss Godolphin and others of the party. The scene was one of rare beauty. The walks led through evergreens lighted with lamps of vari- ous colors. "Miss Wordsworth," said De Vane, "you must have thought me misanthropic when we last met, but you can- not comprehend, of course, my social philosophy; you have seen nothing of the heartlessness of society." "No, Mr. De Vane," she replied, "I have found nothing but kindness. I see that there is unhappiness in the great world about me, but I seem to walk in a charmed circle." "Yes, you remind me of what Coleridge says: ' O lady! we receive but what we give,  And in our life alone does nature live.  Ah! from the soul itself must issue forth  A light, a glory, a fair luminous cloud  Enveloping the earth.'    DE VANE.          87 r'i  All within you is so bright that you see the world about you under the light which your own spirit sheds over it." "You judge me quite too favorably, Mr. De Vane," said Esther. "My observation has taught me," he said, "that the world surrenders the beautiful and the good for the ad vancement of its own system. It worships false gods, and the sacrifices which it brings to their altars are the most costly of all that are laid upon any shrine-living hearts. It reproduces in modern times the cruel worship of that people denounced in the Scriptures, who made their sons and their daughters pass through the fire in the wildness of their cruel idolatry." "I do not know that I understand you, Mr. De Vane," said Esther, surprised at his earnestness. "I trust," he replied bitterly, "that you never may." "Perhaps," she said, "you are taking your estimate of society from Coleridge. But you would not abandon it, as he proposed at one time to do, nor reconstruct it upon his ideal system-would you?" "I'm not sure that I would not," said De Vane. "I value the conventionalisms of the world less every day that I live." "Better contend with what is bad in the world, and strive to make it happier," said Esther. "I do not think that we should withdraw from the world, because it is distasteful to us."  "But," said De Vane, "it offends me. I love its better aspects, but I scorn its meaner ones; and so perverse am I, that I am repelled on the other side by goodness itself, if it has not the graces which certainly do belong to good society. I sympathize intensely with the Greeks in their love of the beautiful, the 76TO Kaov. I could not worship the good, if stripped of its loveliness."     88          DE VANE. "Undine," replied Esther, "might have felt thus before  she received a soul, but surely not afterward." "De Vane," called out Waring, "do you intend that Miss Wordsworth shall lose her supper?" "Ah!" said De Vane, "it seems that we must not for- get our bodies. We were just speaking about the soul, Waring(." "Indeed!" he replied. "I am glad to learn that your  thoughts are so well directed." "We, too, were looking heavenward," said Miss Godol- phin; "for I was just saying that these lamps could not  obscure those stars that burn so far above us, though they seem so brilliant." "They looked upward, and the quenchless stars could  be seen in the pure heavens, burning calmly far above; lights which would still endure, when the glaring lamps  were all extinguished, and the scene about them lost its illusions. They entered the house, and a gay con- versation followed at the supper-table. When the guests were dispersing, De Vane sought Esther, adjusted her wrappings, and conducted her to the carriage, where Mr. and Mrs. Springfield were already seate4. Before reaching it, he said: "We did not conclude our conversation, Miss Words- worth. I am in a labyrinth, and you must extricate me." She smiled, but made no reply. The carriage dashed away; and De Vane really felt as if he had lost a GUIDE. 6   CHAPTER X. "THE highest honors that the world can boast Are subjects far too low for my desire; The brightest beams of glory are at most But dying sparkles of Thy living fire." FRANCIS QUARLES. ON Saturday, at noon, a small traveling-carriage, drawn by a pair of well-matched dark bay horses, drove up to Mr. Springfield's residence. Two gentlemen alighted from it, one of them a venerable man, of most impressive appearance, the other much younger. Mrs. Springfield came to the door to meet them, and her face flushed with pleasure. "Bishop McKendree!" she exclaimed, "I am delighted to see you. We were looking for you;" and she conducted the gentlemen into the house. Bishop McKendree and his traveling companion, a young minister of the Tennessee Conference, were welcomed with a warmth that gratified them, and made them feel that they had reached a home. Some such homes there were through- out the wide extent of country embraced within the Bishop's diocese, where it was felt to be an honor to receive such a guest; but it was with verygreat satisfaction that he en- tered this house. Its well-known hospitality, its refine- ment, its abounding comforts, and the ties of personal fiiendship-all endeared it to him. Esther came in soon after the Bishop's arrival, and she was warmly greeted by -      90          DE YANE. him.  e had known her father. Laying his land solemnly ) upon her head, bright with its rich golden hair, he said: "May the Lord bless thee, with the blessings of heaven above and of earth beneath!" As she raised her head, Mrs. Springfield saw that tears trembled upon her eyelids; and Esther felt that she bose away with her, as she left the room, a treasure of priceless  value in the blessing of an apostolic man, whose hands had been laid upon the head of her father, consecrating him to the self-sacrificing ministry in which he had laid dwn his  life. Mr. Springfield, who had been out on horseback, ar- rived, and hastened to renew the welcome which had al- ready been extended to the venerable guest. In those days the visit of a Bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church was an event as marked and as highly appreciated as a royal visit to some nobleman, when his palatial residence is graced by the presence of his sovereign. In the evening several of the leading Methodists of the town came in, and some hours were passed in delightful conversation. Waring was present, and gave great interest to the conversation, his fine mind being fully roused, and his spirits exhilarated by the presence of a man so much venerated by him. The social qualities of the Bishop were such as to make him an agreeable companion for both young and old. There was dianity, but nothing of coldness in his manner; and his benevolence was so shining, that children and servants felt they could approach him. The hour of nine came-the Bishop's hour for retiring; the Bible and the hymn-book were placed on a table by his side, and he proceeded to conduct the evening service. After reading one of the Psalms, he rose and gave out the lines of a hymn, which all joined in singing; and then, all kneeling, he offered a simple, earnest prayer. Upon resuming their seats, every one felt calmned-spiritualized-as if an angel, in passing had shaken his wings, and left a heavenly atmosphere, which filled the   DE VANE.          91 place. The Bishop rose, and taking leave of the company, was conducted to his chamber. Most of the persons pre- sent left at the same time; but Waring remained, and con- tinued for some time in conversation with the family. Mrs. Springfield expressed her gratification at having the Bishop with them; saying that they were entertaining "an angel," but not " unawares." "Yes," replied Waring, " no purer man, nor kindlier one, breathes the breath of life. He blends the courage of Peter with the gentleness of John. What stay is he to make with you, Mrs. Springfield?" "Me will not leave us before Thursday. He is about to preside, as you know, over the IConference, which is to meet in Augusta."  "Yes, and he can reach there easily by Saturday in the forenoon, taking an early departure on Thursday. I must bring De Vane to see him. .He is a Virginian, you know; AT so is the Bishop; and he has heard favorably of him, through an aunt of his in that State." Mrs. Springfield said: "We shall be happy to see Mr. De Vane. I think highly of him. Do you know his religious sentiments, Mr. Waring?" ' "He has no well-defined religious opinions," replied War- ing. "He was brought up in the Protestant Episcopal Church, and yields a general assent to its creed, I believe; but for two or three years he has been looking into German literature, and I fear lives somewhat in cloud-land." "Yes," said Mr. Springfield, "I remember your saying something of that kind to us when we first made his ac- quaintance. We must bring him into the clear light." "I should rejoice to see him reach it," said Waring. "His nature is a noble one, and if converted, he would not hesi- tate to profess his faith anywhere, though the whole coun- try rang with the cry: 'Is Saul also among the pro- phets?'"     92          DE VANE.  "I hope the cry may soon be heard," said Mr. Spring- field. "It's a little strange," said Waring, that De Vane has  never heard more than one sermon by a Methodist minister in all his life. He heard you, you remember, and he was delighted; but he insists that such a discourse in a Meth- odist Chapel is to be heard only on rare occasions." They all smiled, and Mr. Springfield remarked that he  was very much obliged to him for his appreciation.  "You will bring him to hear the Bishop to-morrow morn-  ing, Mr. Waring, will you not?" said Esther. "Oh! yes, he will feel an interest in him from what his aunt has written. She describes him as a most eloquent preacher."  "How is it," asked Mrs. Springfield, "that he is so ex-  elusive? His nature seems to be a generous one." "Why," replied Waring, " his family is one of the most aristocratic in Virginia. He is a PATRICIAN, so by descent, by alliance, by education, by taste-in short, by every thing. The great wealth of General De Vane puts it in his power to give his son-and George is an only son-every advan-  tage. He would not permit him even to attend a common- school, but employed masters for him at home; and he would not have consented that he should enter any other college in the Southern country than this. The great won- der is, that he is not spoiled; but he is not in the least so. He loves rank, glory, fame, but he loves truth better than either; and while he feels the value of caste, he will never sacrifice himself for any ignoble object. Many would call his ideal of the good and the true romantic, but his ster- ling sense is not under any illusion; and he would sacrifice every thing before he would abandon what he felt that he ought to adhere to and vindicate." "You speak of your friend with enthusiasm, Mr. War- ing," said Mrs. Springfield..    DE VANE.          93 "He rouses my nature," replied Waring. "He is my friend. I am strongly attached to him; he rises so far above the ordinary standard of young men whom I meet, that I honor him as much-as I love him." "We shall expect you to bring him to see us, Mr. War- ing," said Mrs. Springfield. "I am sure that he will be charmed with the Bishop, who has himself the appearance of a patrician."  Esther had listened to the conversation with interest, but she remained silent. Waring rose and took his leave. Sunday came, and overspread the world with its tranquil beauty. The arrival of Bishop McKendree being widely known, the Methodist church was filled to overflowing at an early hour. The citizens generally, of all denominations and of every class, pressed into the humble meeting-house. The aristocratic, the great, and the humble, were all eager to hear a man so eminent for his virtues, his heroic services in the cause of Christ, and his eloquence as a preacher. Waring was in his accustomed seat, De Vane by his side; and as the former glanced over the congregation, he was pleased to see Mr. Clarendon, Mr. Hallam, and other emi- nent men; and among the ladies, Mrs. Clarendon, with Mrs. Habersham and Miss Godolphin. The Governor of the State entered with his family, and seats were found for them quite near the pulpit. Precisely at half-past ten o'clock, Bishop 'McKendree en- tered the church, attended by Mr. Springfield and Mr. Ken- nedy, the pastor, and walked up the aisle to the pulpit. The appearance of the Bishop was very impressive. Nearly six feet in height, and well-formed, he was the imperson- ation of manly vigor and activity, yielding somewhat to the advance of age. His face exhibited intellectual power, blend- ed with benevolence and firmness. His hair fell away from tlhe forehead in heavy locks, and rested on his collar. He     :94          DE VANS.              ; wore a long-waisted, single-breasted black cloth coat, with L  a standing collar, black vest, and breeches of the same ma- terial terminating at the knee, where they were fastened with silver buckles, long black stockings, and polished shoes, with silver buckles-the style of dress which one sees in the portrait of Washington by Stuart. After kneeling   - for a few moments in silent prayer, the Bishop rose, and  opened the services by reading from the Scriptures of the Old and the New Testaments. He then read the hymn deli- berately and impressively, and afterward recited the Mnes, i two by two, while the congregation, rising to their feet, i sang them with a good spirit, the Bishop pausing occasionally to invite attention to the sentiments which they were utter- ing in song. The prayer which followed was comprehen- sive, earnest, spiritual, and deeply reverential, as if the glo- ries of the eternal world were in view. No taste, however critical, could be offended; no heart, however worldly, could be untouched; and many felt that angels' wings rus- tled in their midst, as the fine, pleading voice of the Bishop ascended to the celestial courts. After the prayer, another hymn was sung--the volume of sound swelling beyond the tones of an organ, and rising heavenward. The text was from the First Epistle to the Corinthians, chapter thirteenth and verse thirteenth: "And now abideth faith, hope, and charity, these three; but the greatest of  these is charity." The sermon Was one of extraordinary interest and power, blending grandeur and tenderness; and tears fell from many eyes unused to weep. The graphic power of the Bishop was great, and his illustrations brought the living scenes to view. In describing faith as a principle, he insisted that one of the tests was obedience-simple, thorough obedience; and , he showed how Saul, the stately king of Israel, erred, in de. i parting fi'om the instructions given him as to the destruction j of the Amalekites. "Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I rememr E                '   1   DE VANE. . 95 ber that which Amalek did to Israel--how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt. Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not, but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass." the battle was fought; Saul was victorious. The next morning, Sam- uel, the prophet, goes to visit the conquering king, en- camped at Carmel, who comes forth to meet him, saying: "Blessed- be thou of the Lord: I have performed the corl- mandment of the Lord. The prophet replied: What meaneth, then, this bleating of sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear? And Saul said: They   have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God; and the rest we have'utterly de. stroyed.  Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will j  tell thee what the Lord hath said to me this night. And he t said unto him, Say on. And Samuel said, When thou wast   little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the Lord anointed thee king over ;  Israel? And the Lord sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them 'until they be consumed. Wherefore, then, didst thou not obey the voice of the Lord, but didst fly upon X ,  the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the Lord? And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I' have obeyed the voice of the !  Lord, and have gone the way which the 'Lord'sent me, and w have brought Agag, the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.. .But the people took of the spoils, g sheep and oxen, the chief things of which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God, in Gilgal. And Samuel said, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of i  the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to I hearken, than the fait of rtfms. For rebellion is as the sin of iwritchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry,     96           DE VANE.  Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he hath  also rejected thee from being king."           ; All this was recited in a manner so life-like, that a pano- ramic view of the scene could not have brought it more dis- tinctly before the audience; and he proceeded to describe the confession of the king, his being overawed by the  people and yielding to them, which was the result of want  of faith in God; the eagerness of Saul still to reign; his grasping the mantle of Samuel to detain him; its rending  in his hand; and the prophet's prediction of the king's over-  throw. Every one felt impressed with the dread majesty of God-awed in his presence-and trembled before the  unswerving rectitude of his administration. Then, when the Bishop had shown what faith is, he de-  scribed hope-its exulting, far-reaching view of the world  which lies beyond'the boundaries of time; its revealing  splendors, filling the soul with joy unutterable and full of  glory; its power to hold the soul steadily amidst the storms  of life. Then came his beautiful description of charity,  greater than faith or hope-a mighty principle, dwelling on .! earth and in heaven; the same love warming the heart of an  archangel and filling the soul of the Christian. The power to ' work miracles; the gift of tongues; the most boundless  munificence in ministering to the wants of others-all, all paled before the surpassing glory of love, which would give us the victory over all things, and enable even an expiring martyr to exclaim: "Sink down, ye separating hills!  Let sin and death remove! 'Tis love that drives my chariot-wheels, And death must yield to love." The effect of the discourse was visible throughout the congregation, and Waring looking abo4t him at its close, saw tears coursing down the cheeks of Mr. Hallam. Miss Godolphin's face was buried in her handkerchief, and Mr. Clarendon's countenance exhibited deep emotion.    DE VANE.          97 Another hymn was sung, " glorious hope of perfect love!" and the volume of song which swelled loud and strong, could scarcely drown the sobs and exclamations which would break forth from some hearts. De Van6 was im- pressed. He felt the immeasurable superiority which the glorious views spread before him possessed over all the pageantry of human life in its most imposing aspects. The sublime ,outlines of the Redeemer's kingdom, embracing the universe, were seen by him, and the pomp and splendor of the world paled before its transcendent excelence. Ambition, power, empire-all appeared; in that moment, trifling and insignificant; and the largest interests of time shrank into nothingness before the eternity which stretched illimitably around him. Then, too, the earnestness of this religion touched his heart; no mere routine of duties, no cold outline of forms, but a living, fervent, spiritual worship was all around him. Even his tastes were not offended; for the very presence of the Bishop--a man of culture and refine- ment, as well as of earnestness and power-impressed the whole service, and guided and elevated it. After another prayer, the Bishop pronounced the benediction, and all felt the calm and spiritual influence of his apostolic face, his outspread hands, and his words, beneficent as heaven itself. Long lingered the influence of the morning's servige in the hearts of the great congregation; and the unpretending clhapel seemed, to the view of many, like the glorious temple swhich crowned Mount Moriah, the singers lifting up the voice in praise and thanksgiving, with the trumpets and :ymbals and instruments of music, saying: "For He is good; br his mercy endureth forever." Then the house was filled vith a cloud, so that the priests could not stand to minister, y reason of the cloud, for the glory of the Lord had filled he house of God. 5 * edge        !     CHAPTER XI. "As pilot well expert in perilous wave, That to a steadfast star his course hath bent,   ' When foggy mists or cloudy tempests have The faithful light of that fair lamp yblent,  And covered heaven with hideous detriment; Upon his card and compass firmes his eye, The maystery of his long experiment, And to them does the steddy helm apply, Bidding his winged vessell fairly forward fly. SrNPSER'S Faeri6 Queen6. MoimAoY evening came, and Waring, accompanied by De Vane, walked to the house of Mr. Springfield at an early hour. They were warmly welcomed by Mr. Springfield, who conducted them to the library, where they found sev- eral persons, who had called to pay their respects to the Bishop. Others called in the course of the evening, and among them Mr. Clarendon and Mr. Hallam. Mr. Hallam's father had been a Methodist minister, had 'known Bishop McKendree, and had died, leaving a spotless memory. Mr. Clarendon had learned to venerate the Bishop from the teachings of an aunt, who had long been a member of the Methodist Church in Virginia. The conversation be- came general, and the Bishop was so genial that he charmed every one. His manners stately and yet gentle; his fine sense, his thorough knowledge of public affairs; and his broad views of questions which came up for discussion, made him a most agreeable companion; and De Vane felt that he would grace even the most aristocratic circles of the land. i.                   (98)    '    I;             DE VANE.          99 Without ostentation, he succeeded in bringihg every thing in subordination to Christianity, treated every topic in its relations to it, and impressed every one with the idea that the true solution of all questions must be found in the phi- losophy of God's government of the world. All statesman- ship, he argued, must be guided by the divine law, if it would advance the true glory and prpsperity of the coun- try. "But, Bishop," said Mr. Clarendon, "you would not bring about an alliance between the Church and the State?" "No," replied the Bishop. "But I would recognize Christianity distinctly. I would conduct the affairs of the government in direct reference to the teachings of Jesus Christ. There need be no political arrangement such as exists in England; but the principles of Christianity should be acknowledged as the only basis of the government." "Would not that involve the necessity of providing for some particular mode of worship?" asked Mr. Clarendon. "Not at all," said the Bishop. "It would be unwise to erect an establishment, but the institutions of Christianity should be recognized by the organic law of the state. W6 ought not to content ourselves with a general reference to the government of God in our state papers; but Christian- ity-the system of truth revealed in the New Testament- should be accepted and honored, if we would perpetuate our free institutions." "I think, Bishop, that is already done to some extent," said Mr. Hallam. "We observe the Christian Sabbath, and protect it by law." "Quite true," replied the Bishop. ' But I fear that the tendency is to conduct the government of this country upon principles of human wisdom; and I believe that no political system can stand that does not clearly and broadly recog- nize the law of God as the all-impelling power which guides the fortunes of our race."     100         DE VANE. "Certainly," said Mr. Hallam, " there is much in history to confirm your view." "Yes," said Mr. Clarendon, " both in ancient and modern history; and I must say that I admire the British govern- ment, however much I condemn its ambitious and aggressive policy. The stability of that government is wonderful. Its people are free, and yet the empire stands amidst the con- vulsions of the world with the repose of majestic strength. What do you say to it, Mr. Waring? Am I conceding too much?" "I think not," replied Waring. "The very subject which we are now discussing has attracted my attention much of  late, and the philosophy of history seems to me to be un- mistakable. Nations have perished because they knew not God." "The British government," said Mr. Hallam, "has been much misunderstood in this country. Having been at war with it, we have accustomed ourselves to denounce it; but it is really, if we except our own, the finest government on earth." "I think, Mr. De Vane," said Mr. Clarendon, " you will agree heartily with that opinion; for it seemed to me that you favored, in your oration, which we all heard with so much pleasure, the distinctions in society which are so broad- ly marked in England." De Vane colored slightly, but instantly recovered his self- possession, and said: "It was my object, Mr. Clarendon, to show that the education of English gentlemen surpassed that of any other class in any country, and I attributed that to the advantages which they enjoyed under the aristocratic system of that country. I must say, too, that I admire the British government." "I think," said the Bishop, " that I observe that tendency in the Virginia gentlemen, and I believe, Mr. De Vane, that you are a native of that State."   j              DE VANE.          101 "I am, sir," said De Vane, " and I am happy to know that some of my relatives heard you, upon your late visit to Vir- ginia." "Which of them?" asked the Bishop. Mrs. De Vane,'an aunt of mine,"  said De Vane. "I remember," said the Bishop, " to have pnet her at the house of my friend, iMr. Hamilton; and if you will allow me to say so, I was much pleased with the interest which she manifested in evangelical religion. She impressed me with her earnestness as a Christian." De Vane was highly gratified. Without analyzing it, he felt as if something had occurred to lessen the distance which separated his family from Esther. He said  "Mrs. De Vane wrote me in such terms as satisfied me that she fully sympathized with your sentiments." The Bishop bowed. "Well?" said he, " you think well of the British government. I trust that if we do not rival their aristocratic establishment, we shall not suffer them to outstrip us in reverence for the institutions of Christianity. Do you not think it remarkable that the free states of an- tiquity could not perpetuate their liberty?" "It is, sir," replied De Vane, " an impressive lesson which we learn from ancient history." "And yet," said Waring, " unstable as political institu- tions have proved themselves, how striking is the fact that Chriistianity, springing up' at the very feet of the colossal power of the Roman Empire, has come down to our times without the protection of governments, and is to-day state- lier and stronger than it ever was before!" "Yes," said the Bishop, " and that might teach us that a system so self-sustaining will infuse its own conservative influence into any government with which it is incorporat- ed." "Your philosophy, Bishop," said Mr. Clarendon, "' is sus- tained by modern-history, too. Look at England and France,  102          DE VANE.             ' with only that narrow strip of sea dividing them which lies between Dover and Calais." "Solnething must be attributed to the difference of races," said Mr. Iallam. "The French people have their religion too, and the reigning family seems to be quite devout." "Still," said Waring, " it seems too much to claim, for a  difference between races, to' attribute to that the well-order-i ed political system of England, as contrasted with the in- stability of government in France. I think that Protestant Christianity has much to do with it."  "You are quite right, I think, Mr. Waring," said Mr.  Clarendon. "The popular mind of England, emancipated  by the Reformation, is fitted for the reception of free prin-  ciples. The wide diffusion of Christianity among the masses is so conservative, that liberty of thought and speech may be allowed. The same latitude permitted in France, would inaugurate anarchy, and make it impossible to uphold any government." "Then," said the Bishop, "it becomes Aery important to spread the Gospel as widely as possible through these lands." "Indeed, it is so," said Waring; "and, therefore I should  oppose any thing like a Church establishment in this country.  Let the people be free to choose their own form of worship;  and let the Gospel be preached to them with as little re-  straint as possible."                  - "Free seats, too, Waring?" asked Mr. Clarendon play- i fully.                         I "Oh! by all means," said Waring; "free seats and free grace." All smiled, and the Bishop seemed pleased. "Does not that strike you, De Vane, as somewhat too  democratic?" asked Mr. Clarendon.           : "I am not very well qualified to judge," De Vane replied,  smililog. "I am too little accustomed to that form of wor- i:   DE VANE.          103 ship to decide upon its merits. But I must say, that I am disposed to favor free seats, if the system works as well everywhere as it does in this place; for I did not witness the slightest confusion in the very large congregations as- sembled in the Methodist church, on both occasions when I was present." "Ah!" said the Bishop," I am sorry to say that we sometimes are troubled. I have witnessed a good deal of disorder; but, after all, I do prefer free seats, that the Gos- pel may be preached to the poor." "Can you not provide for that, Bishop, by leaving some free pews?" said Mr. Clarendon. "No," said he. "The poor are sensitive; they do not like to be set apart as a class, to be looked at, especially when they assemble in the Lord's house." "The rich and the poor meet together," said Mrs. Spring- field, taking part in the conversation, " and the LORD is the Maker of them all." "Madam," said Mr. Clarendon, "I think that settles the question. I shall hereafter favor free seats." "Yes," said De Vane, "however broad we may think proper to make the social distinctions of life, there ought to be one place ji the universe where these distinctions vanish, and that is, where all meet before God, conscious of the wants and the aspirations of a common humanity." He spoke with ardor. The Bishop fixed his eyes on him earnestly and, kindly, a d every one seemed impressed with the elevation and be{ uty of the sentiment uttered by one so young, reared so proudly, and making no profession of the Christian faith. A sunbeam passed over Esther's face. "What stay do you propose to make in this place, Mr. De Vane?" asked the Bishop. "It is not at all certain, sir," he replied. "I am at this time in the office of Mr. Clarendon, and it is my wish to pursue my studies there for some time to come."     104          DE VANE. "Your father is in Virginia, I believe?" "Yes. He remains much at home, and I shall visit him in the course of the next summer; but it is by no means settled that I shall ever return to Virginia to fix my resi- dence there." "No," said Mr. Clarendon, " we do not intend to permit Virginia to reclaim Mr. De Vane. We shall keep him among us, Bishop. We can continue to love our mother, even when we go forth into the wide world." "(Yes," said the Bishop, "that I know to be true. A Virginian myself, I cherish a sincere love for my ynative State; but I do not expect even to visit her again. My pilgrimage is nearly ended, and I shall probably lay down my staff in Tennessee, where I have passed much of my time of late years. No matter where, if, in my last mo- ments, I shall be able to say: ALL'S WELL!" The gentlemen here rose to take their leave of the Bishop, and as he took the hand of De Vane, he said to him: ('Farewell, sir. You are young. The great world, is before you. Let me urge you to take the Word of God for your guide; it will be a lamp unto your feet, and a light unto your path." De Vane bowed low, and all who saw the picture long remembered it: the venerable form of the Bishop; his gray locks resting upon his collar; his face full of apostolic earnestness, and the tall stately form of the young patrician bending before him; his dark massive hair; his noble face; his features beaming with emotion, as he heard the parting counsel of the man of God. All who stood grouped around this picture, felt that they had never witnessed a more im- pressive scene-age and youth confronting each other-a pilgrim who was approaching the silent river which sepa- rates TIME from ETERNITY, and a young man just entering upon his course, full of strength, and ardor, and hope. Waring and De Vane retraced their steps toward their   ! DE VANE.                  105 lodgings. As they walked under the star-lit heavens, neither spoke for some minutes. At length De Vane said: "Waring, we have sometimes talked of impressive ob- jects in nature; but for moral sublimity, I have never seen any thing to rival the spectacle which that venerable man presents." "I agree with you," replied his friend; "one quits his presence feeling that he has been enjoying a privilege almost equal to that of him who witnessed the departure of the prophet. It is true we do not see the fiery chariot, but we can not doubt that the man of God, upon whose face we have just now looked, will soon enter the courts of celestial glory. His whole life has had but a single object-the glory of God. He has looked to that as the mariner of early times did to the -polar star; and one can well imagine that angels even now attend his steps." "O Waring!" said De Vane, "I wish that I had a fixed religious faith like yours! I am far out at sea; and while I admire and venerate such a man as Bishop McIKen- dree, my sentiments are rather a tribute to the grand career and heroic character of the man, than to the faith which he professes. I should admire a statesman, a philosopher, or a great military leader just in the same way. The death of Socrates, of which Plato gives us an account in hiS,PHjEDON, filled me with admiration. The calm dignity, the tenderness to his friends, the gentleness toward his enemies, the steady lresistance to the entreaties of those about him; that he would delay a little longer to drink the poison, after the cup had been brought to him, his taking it while the sun yet lin- gered upon the mountains, all this impresses me unspeak- ably." "It is a fine picture," replied Waring, "and Plato has sketched it exquisitely; but really the spectacle of this vener- able man, so heroic, so full of deep sympathy with life, so self-sacrificing in his whole career, standing, as he does, 5*   106          DE VANE. near the invisible boundary of the future world, so calmly surveying that future, so cheerfully walking upon the 'silent solemn shore, Of that vast ocean he must sail so soon,' transcends, in my view, the scene which is brought before us  by the eloquent philosopher of the Academy in describing the closing hours of the illustrious Athenian moralist. Socrates exclaimed: 'I go to die, you to live: but which is best, the Divinity alone can know.' But this disciple of Christ feels that, while it is his duty still to live and toil for his Master, to die will be gain. The clouds of doubt hung about the horizon of the one, the splendors of supernal glory light the j way of the other; and while both fill us with admiration, excited by the heroism exhibited by each, our highest ho- mage is due to the system of truth which enables the dis- ciple of Christ to see the immortal light which overspreads the scenery of the future world." "Waring," said De Vane, "I have never yet found a solution for the tremendous questions which addressed themselves to me while I was yet young: the PAST-the FUTURE. How thick the clouds which cover both! See those stars in countless numbers above us. When were they formed and marshaled in their mighty hosts? Was  there ever an hour when the universe was a solitude? And  if the Being who created these shining orbs, which you and I know to be worlds, fills the throne of the universe, in the midst of such an empire, how can it be that he will fix his regards upon us? These dread questions filled my thoughts when, yet a boy, I wandered at night in the unbroken soli- tude of the forest which surrounds my home, looking at the stars as they seemed to climb the mountain side; and often have I watched their course deep into the night. Like Manfred:   X               DE VANE.           107 'My joy was in the wilderness, to breathe The difficult air of the iced mountains' tops, Where the birds dare not build, nor insect's wing Flits o'er the herbless granite; or to plunge Into the torrent, and to roll along On the swift whiA of the new-breaking wave Of river-stream.'  .   'To follow through the night the moving moon, The stars, and their development; or catch The dazzling lightnings, till my eyes grew dim; Or to look listening on the scattered leaves, While autumn winds were at their evening song.  and then I dived, In my lone wanderings, to the caves of death, Searching its cause in its effect.'  Since I came here, I have sought in books to find some re- vealing light; but so far, I have searched in vain." "De Vane," said his friend, "I have long feared this. You are following false lights, blind guides, wandering stars. I have observed your course of reading. Neither German philosophers, nor English essayists, nor French ontologists can do any thing for you. I sympathize with the scorn- yes, the scorn-with which an Apostle-himself a scholar of the highest order, and of imperial intellect-treated such speculative teachers in his day-a day when Roman litera- ture was striving to rival the glory of the intellectual tri- umphs of Greece. 'Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?' We can make no dis- coveries in the region of morals. Every thing which comes to us from the invisible world is a pure disclosure, and God alone can break the silence that reigns over the space which separates time from eternity. If we would learn, we must open the volume of his revelation." "It does not solve the mysteries which fill the chambers J     108          DE VANE. of my soul," said De Vane. "It is too arbitrary. I am urged to believe, as if believing were an act of volition, and I am instructed that my state for eternity depends upon my acceptance of a creed which I can not comprehend. 'I recall the past-Egypt, the Eastern nations, the states of Greece, the Roman Empire; all the wonders of science which mark- ed their career; all the splendid achievements which light their chronicles; all the literature and the arts which adorn- ed their annals: and I ask myself, can it be possible that the Ruler of the universe overlooked these peoples, and concentrated his regards on a race escaping from bondage on the banks of the Nile, and making their home afterward in that narrow region which skirts the Mediterranean Sea, where, even according to their own records, they rebelled Constantly against the very God whom they professed to worship! Then, too, the appeal made to me to accept as DIVINE a young Galileean, dwelling nearly his whole life in the provincial region of a mere dependency upon the Roman Empire, and put to death at last by his own countrymen! So that the mysteries of nature baffle me, and the teachings of the very Revelation to which you refer me bewilder me. Dread arcana meet me at every glance; these outspread heavens, this mother earth: fathomless depths open before me in my own nature; and the system of Christianity, so fill, as I see it to be, of what is good and beautiful, stands lBefore me like a cunningly-devised fable, intended to soothe the agonizing doubts of a being longing to explore the fu- ture, and to read the mysteries of another state. Who can solve the two great questions of life-the Whence? and the Whither?" "Alh! De Vane," said Waring, " you are indeed at sea- a sea tossed with tempests; and being shaken by tumul- tuous waves, you are losing sight of the friendly lights whch mark the shore, and of the guiding-stars of heaven. 5   on are in great danger of shipwreck. Acquainted, as you   Ig :        DDE VANE.         109 are, with the philosophy of the Greeks, you ought to know that yolfn find no guide theie. Splendid speculations dazzle you, and you must sympathize with the earnest, hope- fl minds which sought to explore the universe without the guiding lights of revelation. God's system for the recovery of a revolted world is a gradual one, for it is a moral one; but it has been steadily expanding, until, at length, it has attained the noon-day splendor which overspreads the Christ- ian states of the nineteenth century. Not to enter upon the wide sea where you are drifting just nowy let me ask you, is it not wonderful that one man-MosES-should, in the midst of the debasing idolatry of Egypt, its polytheism, with all its boasted learning, comprehend the existence of the one true and living God? Is it not also wonderful that a people-the Israelites-dwelling upon the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, which washed the shores of Greece, of Italy, and of Carthage, should alone possess a knowledge of the one God? and that one of their kings should have written such sacred poems in praise of him that, coming down through centn- ries to our own times, a believer c n read them. in the very blaze of our modern civilization, and feel them to be the noblest tributes to the Divine Majesty ever offered? Where did they make their discoveries? And is it not wonderful, too, that a young Galileean, as you style him, should come forth from a provincial home, and utter such words as eclipsed the learning of all the world before his time, and construct a code which stands to-day confessedly the purest, the sublimest system of morals which the world ever knew? From whence did he derive his learning? Where did he find a teacher, so far in advance of those who walked on the banks of the Ilyssus, or instructed their disciples in the groves of Academus? And does this not satisfy you that he was divine? Leaving out of view now his miracles wrought in attestation of the divinity of his nission, does not the very fact of his transcendent and peerless utterances, emerging,     "O         DE VANE.  as he did, from a small, uncultivated, immoral village- Nazareth-satisfy you that his illumination was from the uncreated splendors of the ETERNAL HMSELP?" De Vane looked with wonder upon the glowing face of his friend, as he stood under the brilliant sky. They had stopped in their walk, both absorbed by the great questions which they were discussing. His own features were lit with intellectual power, and he could not withhold his admiration from Waring, now roused to an enthusiasm which he had never witnessed in him before. "We must talk further of all this, Waring," he remarked. "I am indeed tossed upon the waves. There are views, still more bewildering, of a later philosophy, which I must compare with yours." "Philosophy falsely so called," said Waring.    I "When do you leave for Georgia?" "On Thursday morning, with the Bishop. Good-night!" "Good-night!" said De Vane. i !t, i'-   I   O         CHAPTER    XII. "F to spurn at noble praise Be the passport to thy heaven, Follow thou those gloomy ways- No such law to me was given." MARK AKENSIDB. WARING was absent for several weeks. After his de- parture, De Vane entered upon his studies with increased I  ardor. He rarely went into society; and after passing the day at Mr. Clarendon's office, closely engaged in read- ing, he would turn at night to other studies; and often his light was seen burning, by those who passed his lodgings, long after midnight. His taste for German literature was decided; and he found in the book-store of Mr. Muller the finest collection of works in that language which this coun- try afforded. The Reviews, too, interested him; besides the British Quarterlies, he had ordered two from Paris, and was supplied with periodicals from Berlin. Just at that time, quite an impulse was given to the German view of Roman History, by Niebuhr's great work, Romische Geschichte, which had been translated by one of the libra- rians of the British Museum, and he found his ambition fired by turning the pages that recorded the Aeeds of those "sons of ancient fame, Those starry lights of virtue that diffuse Through the dark depth of time their vivid flame." His enthusiasm was roused, and all that was heroic in his nature acquired new vigor. There was every thing to en- (iD     "2          DE VANE. courage him; and as he traced the principles that gave such expansion to the power of Rome, and sent its victo- rious eagles at the head of conquering legions to so many ^ distant provinces, he felt that his own country afforded a broad field for the display of the qualities which had made the men who had constructed that imperial -republic im. mortal. He communed, too, with scholars-the dead and the liv- ing-and learned to disregard society. He corresponded with Mr. Le Grande, and his tastes were directed by the cul- tivated mind of that fine scholar. He was eager to illus- trate the statesmanship of his country, to make its annals glorious; not by military exploits only, but by the higher triumphs of the arts of peace. Patrician as he was by birth, fortune, and association, yet he believed firmly in a  popular government; and it was his wish to see the insti- tutions of the country developed upon the principles so clearly set forth in the Constitution. Impressed with the wisdom of the British Government, he aspired to still high- er statesmanship than the nature of that government per- mitted to be exhibited. It was his wish to guide the com- plex political system of this country to still nobler triumphs. Aristocratic in his tastes, yet he desired the widest expan.  sion for popular sentiment, and he felt that it was a far  higher position to stand before the world called to the great  places of trust by the people, than to accept a portfolio from a monarch. Then, too, this great continent, so widely se- parated from the empires of the old world, afforded, in his' view, a field for the cultivation of the highest powers of statesmanship. Free States, united by a common govern- ment, would rival each other in the glorious task of ad-  vancing human liberty; and he looked forward to the day  when a great people, enjoying the freest political institu- ij tions under the heavens-inheriting the laws, the language, and the religion of England'-would spread the highest civil-    IrS         ' DE VANE.           113 ization the world ever saw, between the two great oceans, the Atlantic and the Pacific; realizing the glowing tribute to our country which had just then been paid to it by a noble poet who laid down his life in Greece, a martyr to his heroic love of that classic land : "Still one great clime, Whose vigorous offspring by dividing ocean Are kept apart, and nursed in the devotion Of freedom, which their fathers fought for and Bequeathed-a heritage of heart and hand, And proud distinction from each other land- Still ONE GREAT CLIME, in full and free defiance, Yet rears her crest, unconquered and sublime, Above the far Atlantic." Mr. Clarendon observed him with great interest, and en- couraged him in his generous studies, and a strong friend- ship grew up between them. De Vane sometimes called in at Mr. Clarendon's and passed the evening; rarely, how- ever, for his books engrossed him; and he met occasionally, at Mr. Clarendon's dinners, the leading men of the State. :'? Chancellor De Lolme, too, a man of culture, and whose ele' gant hospitality was well known, %distinguished as his house was for refinement, induced him sometimes to accept his in- vitations, and honored him by marks of attention, which he always bestowed gracefully. The fine manners of De Vane, his splendid talents, his acquirements, his dignity and puri- ty, made him already a man of rank; and a high career was predicted for him by the eminent men in whose society he appeared. Calling one evening at Mr. Clarendon's, he met Mrs. Habersham and Miss Godolphin, who, preferring that hour to visit Mrs. Clarendon, were in the library. De  Vane would have retired, but Mr. Clarendon would take no ex- se. "Come, De Vane," said he, rising, " this is just what you-     "4          DE VANE. ought to do every evening. These ladies you know, and I  intend to try to bring them to my aid, in inducing you to  quit your books in the evening, and give some of your hours to your friends."  De Vane advanced and took his seat with the ladies, say-  ing: "Really, Mr. Clarendon, you know how happy I ami to meet friends, as you do me the honor to style them, when J I can do so."                     i; "When you can do so, indeed!" said Mr. Clarendon. "I I X assure you, ladies, he is killing himself. Not content with ?9? the light which day gives him, he robs the night, and may be fairly classed among the sleepless."        : The ladies smiled, and Mr. Clarendon said: "It is too X true, Mr. De Vane, you will seriously injure your health. Dr. Dahlgreen was saying only yesterday, that you must be looked after. He was driving past your lodgings on his re- turn from a visit to a patient in the sand-hills as late as two ! o'clock in the morning, and he says he saw your two sperm-! candles burning in the window. Shocking! and there can  be no mistake about it. Your two lights betrayed you; for you must know, ladies, that this gentleman, classical as i he is, disdains the lamp, and insists that two candles make the only light fit for a student." "c We must bribe your good landlady, Mrs. Bowen," said Mrs. Clarendon, "u to deprive you of that luxury." "That would be very hard to do," said Mr. Clarendon, "for I called there last week to see De Vane. He had  walked out; and upon my saying to Mrs. Bowen that she must not permit her young boarder to sit up so late, she  said that it was a great pity, but that she had never known him do any thing but what was right-that he was abso-  lutely perfect, and that she had not the heart to interfere, with any of his wishes. So I very meekly bowed my way out, glad to escape some mark of displeasure for my imper- tinence."  a va   DE VANE.          115 The ladies laughed heartily, and De Vane said: Mrs. Bowen is really very kind to me, and I fear that I give her more trouble than I ought."      , "She, has not prevailed on you to attend church yet?" asked Mr. Clarendon. "No," said De Vane, "and that really seems to grieve her." Turning to Miss Godolphin, he said: "Speaking of attending church, Miss Godolphin, reminds me that I saw you at the Methodist church, when Bishop McKendree preached there.  Did you like him?" "I never heard a sermon that affected me so much," she replied. "If he were residing here, I should attend his church constantly. His very appearance impresses me strangely." "It is very striking," said De Vane; " and his conversa. tion has for me a perfect charm." "I never met him in society," she said; "I should be de- lighted to do so. My aunt and myself were both so much captivated by him, that if he had remained longer we should have called on him." "Yes," said Mrs. Habersham, "I said to Miss Words- worth that she should have sent for us; and that if we had known of his being in town so long, we should not have waited for an invitation to call." "Have you met Miss Wordsworth very lately, Mrs. Habersham?" asked Mrs. Clarendon. "Not within the past fortnight," she replied. "Nor have we. She must be out of town, for we have the pleasure of seeing her here every week when at home." "Do you know her well, Mrs. Clarendon?" asked Miss Godolphin. "Oh! yes," she replied ; i no one better. And she is such a favorite of Mr. Clarendon, that I do not know how he has suffered two weeks to pass without seeing her."     "6          DE VANE. "Yes," said Mr. Clarendon, " it's hard to say which of us loves her most." "And you permit him to say that, Mrs. Clarendon!" said Miss Godolphin, smiling. "Oh! yes," she answered, " he loves Miss Wordsworth, extravagantly, I should say, if I did not know her so well." "' She is angelic," said Mr. Clarendon. "She is very beautiful," said Miss Godolphin. "I never was more captivated by the appearance of any one. I met lier first in this very house, and I at once felt that neither in the living circles of Europe, nor in the picture-galleries which adorn its palaces, had I seen so lovely a person. Then, too, her accomplishments seem to equal her beauty." "Yes," said Mr. Clarendon, " she is very accomplished; her music is nothing short of wonderful. Of that you need I not be informed, however. ' I heard your tribute to her, and I saw how she prized it. She is perfectly enthusiastic about you, and thinks she never heard any thing to equal your per- formance. She says that your singing is unrivaled." "All!" said Miss Godolphin, " the dear, generous crea- ture! She ought to know that she herself is peerless in song. Did you, Mr. De Vane, ever hear any thing to rival her ' Walpurgisnacht '?" "It was glorious," he replied. "Is she a German scholar?" asked Miss Godolphin. "Yes," said Mr. Clarendon, " a thorough one. The Duke of Saxe-Weimar conversed with her for a half-hour in that language, and he told me that her pronunciation was re- markable for its accuracy and purity." "It is wonderful," said Miss Godolphin, " how she could have acquired it!  She has never been abroad, I suppose?" "Never," said Mr. Clarendon; " but she has had the best masters. No expense has been spared in her education. Her own fortune is large, and her uncle; Mr. Springfield, is wealthy and without children; so that every thing has been   H'             DE-VANE.          117 done, that could be accomplished, to educate her in the highest sense." "I learn," saidMrs. Habersham, "that her tastes are peculiar. It is said that she has founded a retreat for young orlphan girls, and that she actually passes much of her time in teaching them." "Yes," said Mr. Clarendo,' it is so. A finer instance of true womanly benevolence I have never witnessed. I have visited the 'Retreat'--by the way, it is called 'Lea- sowes' now, after Shenstone's seat-and a more beautiful and attractive place I do not know on earth. Miss Words- worth does not reside there; but she has employed a re- spectable person, admirably fitted for the place, to take charge of it; and she lites in Mr. Springfield's family. De Vane, did you ever see the place, in your rambles about the , town?" "Yes," replied De Vane, coloring; " my friend Waring was good enough to take me there." "Well," said Mr. Clarendon, " you young gentlemen were entering a very dangerous place, if Miss Wordsworth hap- pened to be present. I should say that Calypso's famous retreat was nothing to it. You must have found Waring -very useful, in the way of a Mentor, to help you break away."  "She was there," said De Vane, smiling; " but we did not expect to find her at home. It was Saturday. It was an extraordinary scene. Her extreme youth, the little girls grouped about her, and the surpassing beauty of the place- all made a rare picture." "The effect very much heightened," said Mr. Clarendon, "by two young gentlemen looking on." "Really, Mr. Clarendon," said Miss Godolphin, "you must take me there." "That I will," said he, heartily. "By the Way, De Vane, when do you look for Waring?"  "8          DE VANE. "Next week," he replied. "I had a letter from him this morning. He has been making a visit to his sister." "He is a noble fellow," said Mr. Clarendon; "a true man. With great parts, he has a heart as generous as ever beat in a man's bosom; and his religion absolutelyrises into grandeur." "I am delighted, DMr. Clarendon," said De Vane, "to hear you speak of him in such terms. I wish all the world knew him as you and I do." "The world will know him," said Mr. Clarendon. "He is destined to be a burning and a shining light." "We met him here," said Miss Godolphin. "I very well remember him. He was the first-honor man." "Yes," said De Vane, " and richly deserved to be." "It seems to me," said Mrs. Habersham, " that I heard some one say he was quite devoted to Miss Wordsworth. Is it so, Mr. Clarendon?" "He admires her beyond measure," said Mr. Clarendon; "but I do not know that there is any thing beyond that." "I am quite sure," said Mrs. Clarendon, " that Miss Wordsworth is free. She is, you know, very young, just seventeen, and she has never loved." Miss Godolphin fixed her large dark eyes on Mrs. Cla- rendon's face, and seemed to be about to speak, but she checked herself, and said nothing. De Vane observed her emotion; he could not comprehend it. "Are you very sure?" said Mrs. Habersham.  "Very young persons sometimes feel the fatal passion." "I am very sure," said Mrs. Clarendon. "Esther Words- worth has never loved. When she does love, if that should ever happen, it will be for always." "Is she ardent?" asked Mrs. Habersham. "Her nature is one of great depth," said Mrs. Clarendon; "and she adheres with tenacity to any purpose which she forms."   X '             DE VANE.          119 "Miss Godolphin, are you ill?" exclaimed Mr. Claren- don. She was deadly pale, and seemed about to fall from her chair, but she rallied instantly, and the rich warm blood, returning from her heart, rushed to her temples. 1 "No," she replied, in a voice whose mournful depth startled De Vane. A servant entered the room with refreshments; and Mr. Clarendon, filling a glass with wine, handed it to Miss, Go- dolphin, and said: "Let us, Miss Hortensia, take some Madeira together; it is a generous wine, and will strengthen you." He bowed to her, and as she replaced the glass, she said: "I must see more of your friend ]Miss Wordsworth, Mr. Clarendon. I must know her." "She will, I am sure, be happy to make you her friend, Miss Hortensia," he said. "As to Waring, the fellow has been so busy with books, that I don't think he has ever thought about loving any one. He has known Miss Wordsworth for some years, certainly ever since he entered college; for he has been intimate with Mr. Springfield from the time of his first coming to pursue his studies here. You must permit me to show him the way to your house, Mrs. Habersham." "We shall be most happy to see him," she replied. "And what do you say, Miss Hortensia? Will you be merciful to my young friend?" "Oh! yes," she said, smiling, half sadly; " he will have nothing to fear from me." "Nothing to fear from you!" said Mr. Clarendon; "Pray, why not? A more dangerous person it would be hard to find." "Ah! Mr. Clarendon," she said, "I am very, very far from being dangerous. I have no faith in the grand passion. Your sex are swayed by ambition; and as for ours, I shall     120          DE VANE. not undertake to interpret their souls. Did you see the Sphinx when you were traveling?" "No," said he, "but I saw woman in marble, every' where, and in every form I read the soul, beneath the cold outlines. Depend upon it, Miss Godolphin, a woman's heart never dies; and as to a young and beautiful woman,  talking of impassibilite, it is quite as rational as to suppose ! the harp is voiceless, which only waits for some hand to sweep its chords, that is skilled in music." Miss Godolphin's eyes were fathomless in their dark depths. She said: "May not the strings of the harp be broken?" "They are often hung upon the willows, from sadness,"  he replied; " but when love informs the soul, then they are swiftly snatched from the melancholy boughs, and made to discourse most eloquent music." "Love, Mr. Clarendon.! it is a myth."         "You are all the more dangerous," he said, " for teaching that doctrine. You beguile your victims. Unconscious of danger, they are helplessly ensnared before they see the fetters." "You know nothing about it," she replied, "and shall  not persuade me to accept your philosophy."  She spoke playfully; but De Vane, who observed her,  felt that some indefinable sadness reigned within her. He could not comprehend it. Young, splendidly beautiful, ac-  complished, full of intellect and soul, she was as sad as  Jephthah's daughter upon the mountains of Israel. "At all events," said Mr. Clarendon, "I shall leave  Waring to take care of himself. I shall observe the process with interest. It will be a study full of instruction, even for  a married man." All laughed heartily, except Miss Godolphin, who smiled,  but said nothing. "You know, Miss Hortensia," said Mrs. Clarendon, "that 'I   DE VANE.          121 before you left us for your travels in Europe, Mr. Clarendon admired you, and you are still a great favourite. He will not spare his friends." Mr. Clarendon assumed an air of great surprise, and said: "How have I offended? Does it occur to you, Mr. De Vane, that I have said any thing out of the way, in pro- nouncing young ladies-captivating?" "I am afraid," said De Vane, "to hazard an opinion upon so grave a question, without bestowing some reflection upon it." "Ah! non-committal. Well, that has become so much the fashion in politics, that the young gentlemen are all falling into it." The ladies rose to take their leave, and the gentlemen handed them to the carriage. The spirited horses dashed off. De Vane bowed, and walked away to his lodgings. He could not withdraw his thoughts from Miss Godolphin her glorious beauty, her sadness, her emotion when allusion was made to an all-engrossing passion, and a life-long attach-  ment-all this interested him in her. He had met her but rarely, and this evening she had impressed him deeply. The interest which he felt in her was indefinable. She was very unlike Esther. Both were lovely--both accomplished; the one was as pure as an angel which had never passed the bounds of Paradise, the other might be an angel just return- ing from some ministering office, which had touched her celestial spirit with sadness.

When will he awaken? ' Asks the midnight's stately queen."  Awakening of Endymion. UNHEEDING the remonstrances of friends, De Vane still pursued his studies. Still his light burned in his room until  long past midnight; and passers-by remarked it. History, politics, metaphysics, engrossed him. The pictured pages of  Livy fired his ambition; and he reviewed with delight the  early history of that wonderful people whose empire, begin:  ning upon the Tiber, grew until it overspread the world. The politics of the world, too, interested him, and he sought, in history, to discern the great principles which might enable him better to comprehend the merits of the great struggle going on throughout the country. What consti-  tuted the real wealth of a nation, or contributed to its true glory, he searched for; and, rising above the small consider- ations which swayed so many about him, he investigated the philosophy of statesmanship. Metaphysics he delighted in. He had gone over the whole field of the modern school in his senior year, but h'e now explored the wider range of  speculative philosophy, and was deep in the Serbonian bog  of fathomless disputation. The brilliant papers of Heine fascinated him; the sombre, cheerless philosophy of Leib-  nitz involved him in the toils of fatalism; and the subtle I ;   DE VANE.          123 disquisitions of Bolinghroke captivated him. The cold un- belief of the first of these writers troubled him; for, with an ardent nature, he desired to believe and trust, He could not look out upon the universe and pronounce it unmeaning; nor could he tolerate the thought that humafnity was in a state of orphanage. He looked upon the world in its glo- rious beauty of hill and dale, and mountain and valley, and ocean and plain, smiling with summer verdure, or grand with the splendors of winter; or to the heavens in their im- mensity, through which the countless orbs rushed with so much velocity, and yet so much order; and he could not consent to yield up his early belief that upon the throne of the universe there was seated a God of boundless benevo- lence. Still he was troubled. He comprehended the deep yearning of the spirit for the right way. He felt, with Plato, "that every soul is unwillingly deprived of truth." De- prived of truth he would not be, if he could succeed in ex- ploring the wilderness about him, and find the way lighted by the Divinity. His consciousness assured him of the ex- istence of his soul. Was that soul immortal? The dread question which troubled Job haunted him: "Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? Are not his days also like the days of an hireling?" And then came the response of the patriarch to his own question: "If a man die, shall he live again?"Here was the great cry of the soul which had been heard on the: plains of the east so long ago, uttered once more. "Mr. De Vane," said Mrs. Bowen, " you are not looking well. I think you study too hard." De Vane was at the breakfast-table. He had been up very late the night before, and his long course of study began to tell upon his health. Young, vigorous, and active as he was, he was becoming thin, and his face had lost its color. His large dark eyes seemed to increase in depth and splendor, and his appetite was gone.     124         DE VANE.  Mrs. Bowen had forborne as long as her kind nature would permit her to forbear. She loved the young student as if he had been her son; and her eyes filled with tears as  she saw him this morning, seated at the table, languid and thoughtful. De Vane smiled, and said: Why, Mrs. Bowen, would you have me indulge myself-you who are so active and so busy?"  "No, Mr. De Vane," she replied, " there is no danger of that. You will never indulge yourself; but you must spare yourself. Young people ought not to break themselves down. When they get older and stronger, then they can bear more."  "But I am not working very hard. There is so much to learn, that I am trying to do something while I am young." "Yes, sir; but you see Solomon says that much study is  a weariness to the flesh; and he knew all about it. There, you have eaten scarcely any thing at all-one egg, but one biscuit, and half a cup of coffee. Why, that would not do  for a child." De Vane smiled and said: "Never mind, Mrs. Bowen. I will make up for it yet. I must take a little more exercise, e and then I shall eat like a mountaineer, as I am."  : "It was only last week," said Mrs. Bowen, "that Mr. Clarendon scolded me for letting you sit up so late, and  yesterday I was at Mr. Springfield's, and Mrs. Springfield  asked about you, and said she was afraid you were not well, and that she understood from Dr. Dahlgreen that you were  killing yourself with books." "Indeed!" said De Vane. "Was Mrs. Springfield kind enough to ask after me?"  "Certainly she did," said Mrs. Bowen. "And she said that Miss Wordsworth was going on in the same way; for, after passing nearly the whole day at her little school, she would sit up half the night, studying."   I          IDE VANE.          125 DeVane felt the blood rising to his face. He had not seen Esther since Waring left the town, and this sudden mention of her name in connection with his own by Mrs. Bowen, in her kindness of heart, bringing the strictures of Mrs. Springfield to her support, recalled her so vividly, that he was conscious of a very indefinable sensation." I I hope Miss Wordsworth's health has not suffered," he said, looking earnestly at Mrs. Bowen.  "She says not; for she was sitting by when Mrs. Spring- field spoke to me, and she was looking as beautiful as I ever saw her. She is as good, too, as she is pretty." "Why, Mrs. Bowen, you are actually becoming poetical in your descriptions. One of the very finest tributes ever paid to a lady has that very thought in it: "'Yes; she is good as she is fair.'" "Well, Miss Wordsworth deserves it," said Mrs. Bowen. ' If I did not know that no human being can be perfect, I should say she is. If she has a fault, it has never been discovered. Yet her whole life is spent in doing good. Taking care of little orphan girls, most people would think was enough; but she visits the sick, and helps the poor besides. For about two weeks she has been nursing Mrs. Gildersleeve's daughter, who is dying of consumption." "But could no one be found to take her place?" "No; no one can take her place, Mr. De Vane. Little Eva Gildersleeve was one of her Sunday-school scholars, and now about twelve years old; but she is dying, and she clings to Miss Wordsworth as if she was the only person in all the world that could do her any good. And to hear her talk to that child about Jesus, and about heaven, as I did, day before yesterday, is better than a sermon. I thought I could almost hear the rustling of angels' wings in the room."     126                          ' DE VAN E. Mrs. Bowen's eyes filled with tears, and De Vane was  impressed with the fine expression of her matronly face, as  she uttered the beautiful tribute to Miss Wordsworth, un-  conscious of the exquisite picture she had painted-a pic- ture worthy of the pencil of Raphael-this young, bright,  accomplished woman, ministering to a dying girl, in a way so comforting and tender, as to make the spectator feel that angels must press forward to witness the scene. This, then, accounted for her absence from society; this explained why Mrs. Clarendon had not seen her for the two weeks past. He said nothing. He rose from the table, and walked out into the streets; but through every hour of  that day, and for many days afterward, did he recall the scene which Mrs. Bowen had described.    .  The next day Waring returned. He came in the evening  coach; and, very soon after his arrival, he walked to Mrs.  Bowen's, and inquired for De Vane. MrIs. Bowen welcomed him warmly. Waring was a great favorite, and she really venerated him, young as he was.                          r "Well, Mr. Waring," she said, I'm glad you've come. We've all missed you; and as for Mr. De Vane, since you left, he has hardly gone out at all. He does nothing but , study from morning till night; till night indeed-I might  say till the next morning."  "Ah!" said Waring, "I must look after him; is he in?"  "'No," she replied; "this is the only time in the day  when he takes a walk. But he'll be in very soon; it's nearly  supper-time, and he never keeps me waiting. Come in, and stay to supper." "Thank you," said Waring, "I will do so," frankly ac- cepting the hearty invitation. "And I must beg you too,"  said he, "to consent to take me as a boarder. You can spare me a room, and I shall try to help you take care of De Vane."                 *    DE VANE.         12I Mrs. Bowen's face brightened. "You know," she replied, "I hive hardly ever taken any one to board. Sometimes two or three little girls, who come here to go to school, and whose parents will make me take them; but when Mr. De Vane came and told me how he hated to stay at a hotel, and how he wished to be quiet, I took him. Opposite to his room there is one just as large, and if that will suit you, you know that there is no one in the world I would rather have than yourself. And as th Mr. De Vane, he will be delighted, I know. JHe told me when he came to keep it, and said he would pay for it just as if some one was in it; but he preferred to have it vacant, until some friend of his came to take it. He did not say who it was. I told him he ought not to do that, but he said I must let him have the room, and that it would do him a great favor." "Very well," said Waring; "that's all right. I'll settle that matter with De Vane. I'll take the room for my own, and I am very much obliged to you, Mrs. Bowen, for your kindness in consenting to be troubled with me." "Troubled indeed!" said she. "If people in this world gave no more trouble than you and Mr. De Vane do, I would think the millennium had come." Waring laughed, and the good old lady busied herself in preparation for tea. Soon after, De Vane's step was heard in the hall; and, opening the door, he walked into the room. "Mehercule! Waring," said he; "where did yu drop from, old fellow? I'm delighted to see you." "i Not from the clouds," said Waring, " like another class- ical friend of yours, or I should, like him, have broken my leg. As it is, I am only very much bruised by beating about in a stage-coaci from Augusta." "You have been gone an age," said De Vane, "and de. serve to be bruised for staying so long." I     128          DE VANE.  "But, see here, De Vane," said Waring, " what is the matter with you? You are thin and pale. What have you been doing with yourself?"  "Nothing," said De Vane. "I suppose I have not walked  as much as I was accustomed to do, when we took our  I strolls together. Now that you are here, I shall do bet-  ter."                         i  "Yes," said Waring, "I intend to see to that. My good friend, Mrs. Bowen, here, says that I may have that room opposite yours, which, I take it for granted, you intended I should have from the beginning." "Why, in all candor, Waring, I am heartily glad that  you take it, but I acted upon the plan of Englishmen upon  the Continent. I'm told that to make sure of their comfort, i when they find a pleasant hotel, they engage all the rooms on the same floor, so as to exclude all comers, except some people who may happen to be agreeable to them. The room is yours, of course. When will you take possession?" "To-morrow; if Mrs. Bowen will suffer me to do so?" "Oh! yes, sir," said Mrs. Bowen; " it can be put in or-  der to-morrow morning. It is already pretty well furnished, and any thing else that you want I will get for you." "I think, Waring," said De Vane, "I shall transfer, if  you will permit, sundry articles from my own room. I have i been indulging my taste in selecting articles from time to time, until I can hardly turn around in my room; and, with ! other things, I selected, the other day, a melodeon, which has not yet been sent home. You must take charge of that, and I shall charge you for the use of it by making you in- struct me, as you did during our summer vacation." "You see, Mrs. Bowen," said Waring, "that he intends to make me a music-teacher forthwith." "You must take away some of his books," said Mrs. Bowen. "Mr. Clarendon told me to do it, but I was afraid to trouble him."   8I   ^DE VANE.         129 "I'll attend to his case," said Waring. They sat down to supper, and two little girls, from ten to twelve years of age, took their seats with them. It was a round, cheerful table, loaded with luxuries, for Mrs. Bowen was a famous housekeeper. Waring asked a blessing. It had been many months since Mrs. Bowen was so hap- py; and in her heart she sent up a thanksgiving to the Lord, for spreading sunshine through her house. She had a com- petency, and was childless. A woman of good sense and good breeding, she was highly respected, and saw the best society in the town. She was a fervent Christian, too, abounding in good works; and the young and the old loved her for her gentleness and kindness. She was espe- cially a favorite with Mr. Clarendon, who often declared, that when he felt at all depressed, he would walk to Mrs. Bowen's to get her to cheer him. Her house was always cheerful. If there was a single ray of sunshine breaking through the clouds, it somehow fell on her. She loved Esther as she loved no one else on earth; and often accompanied her on her visits to the sick and the poor. It was at the special request of Mr. Clarendon that she too De Vane as a boarder; and the young student had lready become strongly attached to her. His ample for- tune enabled him to gratify his tastes, and with great deli- cacy he often supplied luxuries which he persuaded her no one could find so well as himself. More than once, he had enabled her to relieve cases of suffering by supplying means just at the moment when they were needed. Now that Waring had come, she felt that her happiness was complete, for she loved him next to Esther. "How is my friend Mr. Springfield, Mrs. Bowen?" asked Waring. 6*     130         DE VANE. "Very well, sir. He was speaking of you a few days since, and said that you staid longer than he supposed  you would; but that he hoped to see you soon."     i "I'm very much obliged to him. I found that my affairs in Georgia required my attention. The Conference was in session a week.": "So I heard, from Mr. Arthur." "Ah! yes. How do you like that appointment?" "Oh! we are all pleased," said Mrs. Bowen. "You know that he is a great favorite here, and his congregations are very large. The old church will hardly hold them." "I supposed it would be so-he is really a very fine preacher. He has a way of reaching the heart, that gives him access to it before you know it." "Mr. Springfield is very much pleased with the appoint-  ment," said Mrs. Bowen; "you know they are .good friends." "Yes," said Waring; "intimate as brothers."      - "And Miss Wordsworth," said Mrs. Bowen, "she says  that he writes as well as he preaches. He has written for  our new paper, and she is very much pleased with his let- : ters. You know that she is a judge of such things." "Indeed she is," said Waring, "and I agree with-her. The truth is, he has one of the best libraries that I know;  in fact, the very best that I know belonging to a travel-  ing preacher. Have you heard him, De Vane, since he came?" "No," said De Vane. "I have not been in a church  since you left me."  "Really, Mrs. Bowen," said Waring, "we must look   g after this young Virginian. He is far from home, and we must try to induce himn to return to his early habits." "I like to hear good preaching," said De Vanie, "and will go with you sometimes with pleasure, to -hear this gentleman who is so highly esteemed by you. If you and -"- ^!" i d '"    DE VANE.         131 Mrs. Bowen and Mr. Springfield think so well of him, I am sure that he must be worth hearing." "He began to preach at eighteen," said Waring, "and has been a hard student ever since. He is sometimes as eloquent as Jeremy Taylor, and yet is perfectly unaf- fected." Some time after, Waring rose, and saying to Mrs. Bow- en that he would come back in the morning, proposed to return to his hotel. De Vane accompanied him, and they entered into a con- ,versation about their plans for the future. It was War- ing's purpose now to enter upon his theological studies; and his plan embraced a two years' course. The large library of Mr. Springfield was open to him, and he should enjoy the instructions of that gentleman, and of Mr. Ar- thur, the minister just appointed to the station. Licensed already to exhort, it was his purpose to engage, as exten- sively as possible, in the duties of that office, while pur- suing his regular course of study. There was not the slightest cant about him, but he spoke seriously, and even earnestly, about his work-its duties, responsibilities, and encouragements. "Have you seen Mr. Springfield within a few days, De Vane?" "No," said he. "I have scarcely made any visits since you left me." "He expressed a strong interest in you," said Waring, "and you ought to see as much of him as possible. He is a thorough, scholar-a man of extraordinary breadth of view, and one of the most delightful men in corversation that I have ever met." "I am very strongly disposed to like him," said De Vane, "and I have the greatest respect for him; but the truth is, I hardly know how I have spent the time that has elapsed since you took your departure. How long has it been?"     132          DE VANE. "Six weeks, to a day," said Waring. "Is it possible?" exclaimed De Vane. "It seemed an age when I thought of you; but I did not know that the winter was so nearly gone." "Yes," said Waring; "spring is almost here. How swiftly the winter. has gone by! It will soon belong to } the past. Do you remember, De Vane, the address of  Apollo to Mnemosyne? ' can read A wondrous lesson in thy silent face.'" "Yes," replied De Vane, "memory is silent, but a pow- erful teacher."               , "Do you hear any thing of Miss Wordsworth these days?" asked Waring. "Only through Mrs. Bowen," he said. "She was de- scribing to me yesterday a scene which was so exquisitely touching and beautiful, that it has been before me ever since. It seems, that for some two weeks past, she has been watching by the side of a little girl dying of con- / sumption." "Did you hear the name of the child?" asked Waring. "Eva Gildersleeve. I was struck with its beauty.  "Ah!" said Waring, "I have been looking for that  through the winter, but she must have declined very rapid.,  ly, to be in a dying state. She is one of the brightest little i creatures on earth. I know her well. I must call and see her before it is too late. De Vane, yoi will excuse me?" - "Certainly; but you will not go to-night?" "Without a moment's delay," said Waring, and De Vane; taking leave of him, returned to his lodgings. Waring walked rapidly to the house where the little girl was waiting for death. It was a small, neat house, with a garden in front, and through the closed blinds Waring saw a light shining cheerfully. He knocked at   DE VANE.          133 the door, and it was opened by Mrs. Gildersleeve, who in- stantly recognized him and invited him in. X   He entered the room where Eva's little bed was placed, ;S  and in which a cheerful fire was burning. No one was i  present but an old colored servant belonging to Mr. Spring- field. Aunt Ilester-as she was called-was seated near the bed. She was an excellent nurse, and her qualities were invaluable. She knew Waring well, and often de- clared that he was "a saint on earth." / She was of that class of servants so rarely met with now; faithful, strong- ly attached to the family of her master, humble, cheerful, and feeling as deep an interest in the welfare of the family as if every thing belonged to her., She rose when the young gentleman entered the room, 1? N and her face showed the pleasure which his coming gave her. XH   "( How. are you, Aunt Hester?" said Waring, frankly ex- tending his hand to her. "Thank the Lord! Master Waring, I'm well," she said, with a low courtesy. Waring walked to the bedside. The little girl was sleeping. Her fair hair fell in natural ringlets about her face; the delicate features were as clear as if cut from mar- ble, and the lips, slightly parted, disclosed the fine regular teeth. Even in sleep the face was full of expression, and it was luminous, as if some unseen being whispered in her ear words which thrilled her. Waring looked down silently into her face, and the tears, trembling for a mo- ment on his eyelids, stole down his cheeks. "So He giveth his beloved sleep," he said, almost un- consciously. Turning away from the bed, he took a seat near Mrs. Gildersleeve, and inquired if there were any one to sit up with the child through the night. "Yes, sir," she replied, "Miss Wordsworth will be here     134          DE VANE.              d presently. She comes every night, for Eva will ask for her if she does not find her by her side. I do not know how she keeps up, sir, for she has been here every night for two weeks, except one, and she scarcely sleeps at all." "Could I not relieve her?" asked Waring. "I fear not, sir," she said. "I wish some one could, for t it distresses me to see that young lady wearing herself out. She is an angel on earth, Mr. Waring." He made no reply, but sat quietly watching the face of the sleeper. How impressive is such sleep! In -all the wide realm of nature, there is nothing so touching as the face of a child in sleep! The unconsciousness, the helpless- ness, the coming future, with its trials, its temptations, its sufferings, its perils! Who that has bent over the forms of his own sleeping children has not experienced unutter- able emotions? Who has not felt an indefinable sadness '  as he thinks of the wide, hard, dreadful road which those - little feet must tread till they stop at the grave, where the i weary head is to be laid down in the long, long sleep? And who can look down upon such a sight without a silent prayer to the FATHER, that he would guide the feet aright and cover the defenseless head?         i A carriage drove up to the gate, and Esther came in silently but quickly. She saw Waring, and her face brightened; a smile broke over it, and as he rose to meet her, she grasped his hand warmly, saying: "I am very glad to see you."                      "And I am happy to see you, Miss Esther," he said,   i "very happy. I see that our little friend is passing away from us. I feared it, but is it not a rapid decline?" "Very," she said; "she took cold on New-Year's day, and has been sinking rapidly since then. When did you return?" "Only this evening, and hearing that little Eva was in   I             DE VAN.          185 a dying stateI hastened to see her. Will you not suffer me to relieve you to-night? You must need rest." "No," she said, ' she would miss me, and she can stay but a night or two longer with us. I can not leave her." "Then," said Waring, "I will come to-morrow night, I and if you will not consent to be relieved, I will watch j with you." She smiled, and laying aside her wrappings, gave some instructions to Aunt Hester, and seated herself by the bedside. Waring stood for a moment, looked once more at the little sleeper, took leave, and walked out of the house.     CHAPTER   XIV. IDEATH is upon me, yet I fear not now. Open my chamber-window; let me look Upon the silent vales-the sunny glow That fills each alley, close, and copsewood nook." ROBERT NICOLL. THE next morning, Waring took possession of his room, and was for some hours industriously at work, arranging his books and furniture. De Vane assisted him, and they felt as if their college days had returned. Their rooms wele  divided by a hall, and both opened upon the street, so that they wore a cheerful aspect. Their books, which were numerous, were arranged upon small movable cases, so that they could be reached without inconvenience; and quite a number of engravings adorned their walls. There was a hlome feeling about their lodgings which gave them a great charm; and as De Vane surveyed his friend's room, he  looked brighter than Mrs. Bowen had seen him appear for weeks. "W1ell, Waring," he exclaimed, "now we shall be able to work like Trojans. We may venture to accept Sir Wal- ter Scott's challenge. You know, when he adjusted himself to his labors-about to enter upon a new field-he said that he took for his motto, 'Time and I against any two.' I think there are two here that will give him something to do, if' he beats us at hard work." "You know I am a Methodist," said Waring, "and that name was applied to us at first because we were exact and  (13C)  [.   DE VANE.          137 methodical in all things. Now, we must adopt systelm in our work. None of your sitting up all night. We will study by rule." "That's right," said Mrs. Bowen, who stood by, cheerfully surveying the room. "See to that, Mr. Waring, and we shall all thank you. Mr. Clarendon says that he sits up most unreasonably late." De Vane laughed, and said: "Well, Mrs. Bowen, you will not send me to bed before twelve o'clock, will you?" "I think ten o'clock is late enough," she said; "but if you will really be in bed by twelve, that will be doing so much better than, you have been doing, that we must not quarrel with you." "We consider that a treaty, formally agreed on, then, Mrs. Bowen," said Waring, "and I will undertake to see that it is carried out in good faith. Thereis another thing, too, that I shall insist on, De Vane, and that is, that you and I walk two miles every evening at sunset, and we will begin to-day." g  "Very well," said De Vane; "you may make it five miles if you like; and I am with you, through storm and sun- shine." "Two miles will do," said Waring;   and as this is a bright day, we shall make an auspicious commencement." Punctually at five o'clock, Waring rapped at De Vane's door, and reminded him that the hour appointed for their walk had arrived; and they set out with rapid strides. They turned their steps toward that part of the town where Mrs. Gildersleeve resided; and as they were passing the house, Mr. Springfield's carriage dashed up to the door, and Mrs. Springfield and Miss Wordsworth alighted from it. The gentlemen instantly stopped, and advancing to the ladies, spoke with them. "O Mr. Waring!" exclaimed Esther, "I have just been sent for. Little Eva is sinking so rapidly, that it is feared       \   ' .,     138          DE VANE. she will die in the course of a few hours." Her eyes glist. ened with tears, and in her eagerness, she laid her hand on Waring's arm, ad looked up into his face, as if he could help her in this Btur of suffering. . "I will go ii with you, to see her," he replied. "Mr.  De Vane, will you come with us? This is the little girl  that I spoke of last night." Mrs. Springfield had already entered the house. Esther turned her face full upon De Vane, and looked an entreaty that he would join them. He was touched. He might pos- sibly be wanted; he might render some service in this house, when the angel of death had crossed the threshold, and was about to lay his dark wings about a helpless child. He bowed, and entered the house with them. They found the little girl lying on a sofa that was drawn up in front of the fire. Her fair curls were brushed away from the face, and her large blue eyes beamed with expression. As Esther entered the room with Waring, Eva's face lighted up with almost celestial radiance, and she turned her eyes on War- ing, and said:         . I am so glad to see you, sir. Mother told me you had comle." Waring seated himself in a chair by her side, and taking  her hand, said: "Yes, my dear little Eva, I came to see you last night, but you were sleeping, and I would not disturb you." Esther was kneeling by the sofa, and bending over, she kissed Eva's forehead. The little girl smiled, and gave her a look of unutterable love. De Vane stood leaning against j the mantel-piece, while Mrs. Springfield and Mrs. Gilder-  sleeve were seated at the feet of the little girl.  "Mr. Waring, I am so glad to see you. I was not willing  to die till I saw you again. I have heard you so often speak  of Jesus, that I felt anxious to have you here, that I might tell you how much I love him now." i   DE VANE.          139 "Dear, dear child!" said Waring, I have long known that you loved him; and I have often told you that Jesus loved you." "Yes," she said, "and I feel it now. It seems to me that I can almost hear the tones of his voice; and last night, while I slept, it seemed to me that angels filled the room." Esther's eyes rained tears, and the large drops rolled down Waring's face. De Vane was very pale, and his lips were compressed firmly, as if he braced himself against enmotion. "Miss Esther," the child said, "has been so kind. I am sure that the angels in heaven can not be kinder to me than she has been; and she has talked to me so sweetly about Jesus, that I felt I loved him more and more." "My precious little Eva," said Esther, "'you may be , sure that Jesus loves you, and that good angels are all about you."    "Yes, Miss Esther, I know it now. I am going to see the Lord in his bright abode. Oh! how bright it is! I am not afraid to go. I was, for a long time, afraid to die; but not now; no, not nov,. I am sorry to leave my mother, and you, Mr. Waring, and Miss Esther, and my friends; but heaven is so bright, and Jesus is there, and you will all be coming before long." -Mrs. Gildersleeve's frame shook with emotion, but she could not disturb the calm heaven which filled the heart of her dying child. "Miss Esther," said the little girl, " is not the sun shin- ing bright?" Yes," said Esther, "it is almost sunset; but the even- ing is very beautiful, dear Eva." "Well, then," said she, " open the blinds, if you please, and let me see the sky and the trees once more. I shall never see them again." De Vane raised the sash and threw open the blinds. S     "O          DE VANE. The rich, warm rays of the sun streamed in, and the trees and tall shrubbery about the house were touched with colors such as painter never yet spread on canvas.  "It is a beautiful world," said Eva, "very beautiful;  but I shall soon see a brighter one. Miss Esther, did you not tell me last night, that Jesus said he would go to pre- pare a place for us?"  "Yes, my dear Eva," said Esther, "he said so; and it is a lovely place. So many good people have already gone there; and the angels are there, and our Lord himself is there." The little girl's face was radiant. Upon her features, over which an unearthly beauty lingered, the glory of the upper world was shining. "Miss Esther," said she, "will you sing for me?" "My dear, dear Eva, what shall I sing?" "Oh! the lines that you sang for me when I was so    weary, last week; they are so beautiful!" Esther calmed herself; and having regained her compo- sure as far as was possible in such a scene, she sang some lines which the Methodists had introduced into their social meetings-- "Oh! sing to me of heaven;" and as her voice, almost trembling with the strong emotion which she could scarcely repress, uttered the words, "Let music cheer me last on earth, And greet me first in heaven," the lips of the dying child parted, and a smile of more than earthly brightness illuminated her face. Esther felt the little hand which the held grasp hers more closely, and then, with an earnest look upward, she said faintly, "Heaven!" and the light faded out of her eyes. "Let us pray," said Waring.  All kneeling, Waring   IDE VANE.         141 breathed a fervent prayer, thanking God for having guided the little feet of this child in the way to heaven; entreating him to enable them all, by his grace, to follow in the same way, observing the footprints of our ascended Lord; and imploring the divine blessing upon the mother, now left a lonely pilgrim on earth. :::  Waring and; De Vane withdrew from the room, and left the house. "What a scene," said De Vane; "what a scene! How nearly weakness and strength touch each other, and the sublime and the gentle are sometimes brought together!" "Yes," said Waring, "there indeed weakness and strength were brought together: a little girl dying in' her weakness, and the strong angel leading her by the hand} and shining away all her fears." "It is very wonderful," said De Vane. "Out of the mouth of babes He can ordain strength," ?-  replied Waring. "A sublinmer s    I r scene I never witnessed," said De Vane; "a hero perishing in battle can not eclipse that." "That is just such a tribute as Rousseau paid to Him who died for that little girl. You of course remember his comparing the last hours of Socrates, taking the cup of poison in the midst of cheerful conversation with his friends, with the dying hour of our Lord, expiring in the midst of enemies, and his body torn with anguish, yet praying for his murderers. The tribute wrung even from that man was the highest he could yield. 'Socrates died like a philosopher; Jesus Christ like a God.' I tell you, De Vane, that since the triumph of Jesus Christ, all who trust him may conquer death." i   "That was indeed a victory which we just now witness- ed. Of what priceless value that faith must be which can enable a child even to triumph over such an enemy!"    "Yes," said Warin; " and I hope, De Vane, that you will ' soonfind it."     "2          DE VANE . "Ah! Waring," he replied, I am in mists; sometimes I fancy that I see the rifts which let in the sunlight, but the clouds roll once more over the heavens, and the very stars are blotted out." Waring did not think it best to press his view of the great question just now. He knew that De Vane, like a strong swimmer, would buffet the billows, disdaining help, until his natural strength was exhausted. He comprehended the structure of his character-his pride, his candor, his love of truth, his veneration for all that was really noble and good; and he inwardly hoped that he would yet exclaim with Nathanael, when the true light reached his soul:- "Thou art the Son of God: thou art the King of Israel." The next day was Sunday. De Vane asked Waring at  the breakfast-table when the funeral of the little girl would X take place.         . "This evening, I learn," said Waring, "from her mother's residence." "It is proper," said De Vane, " that some grown persons should act as pall-bearers; and, if it be agreeable to her friends, I will join you in performing that office. I suppose that you will assist in that way." "Thank you," said Waring warmly. "It is very kind of you, and it will gratify us all."          i Mrs. Bowen's eyes swam in tears. At five o'clock, quite a large number of persons assem- bled at Mrs. Gildersleeve's residence; and among them, persons of the highest respectability. Mr. Springfield con-  ducted the services. He took no text, but made some re matks, sketched with fine taste the beautiful character of the little girl, and described her last hours. "Over such a death," said he, "there can be no bitter tears; the hour for grief has gone by, the suffering is ended, and the spirit has found in its native heaven perfect bliss in the smile of Him who, when on earth, took little children in his arms, and   IgT        . DE VAS'E.       143 I  blessed them. Let us bear this beautiful, lifeless form to the grave, where flowers will soon spring over it, and the night- dews will water it. She is not dead, but sleepeth." Waring and De Vane, with two of the larger boys of the Sunday-school, walked on either side of the hearse. Esther saw De Vane with indefinable emotions. She knew his aristocratic tastes; and yet here he was, walking by the side of the remains of a little girl of humble family to the grave. Mrs. Springfield could not repress her aston- ishment. "Esther," said she, "do you observe Mr. De Vane? The patrician must have something very gentle in his na- ture." Dr. Dahlgreen, a warm friend to Mrs. Gildersleeve, com- ing up to the carriage, said: "Bless my soul! Mrs. Springfield, this is the most aris- tocratic funeral that I have attended in an age. There is X Waring, the first-honor man. I can account for him on the score of his Methodism; but what on earth can have induced that young Virginian, who is as proud as Lucifer, to take his place there?" Without waiting fy an answer, he walked off to his gig, and followed the procession. The burial-service was read at the grave, and as the mound was raised above it, the whole party of Sunday- school children threw flowers upon it. The level rays of the setting sun streamed over it, and Esther felt as if the smile of God warmed the lowly couch of the little sleeper. That night, when Waring had returned from church, De Vane entered his room, and said:, "Waring, what are Mrs. Gildersleeve's means of living?" "Very moderate," replied Waring.' "She is industrious, and lives mainly by her own labor." "She will of necessity incur some unusual expenses now. Will you be good enough to hand her this?"     "4         DE VANE. He put into Waring's hand a purse of dark silk, contain- ing one hundred dollars in gold. "I do not know her personally," he added, "and I do  not wish that she should know that it comes from me. Slhe might feel hurt at accepting any thing from a stranger."  "It is very kind of you," said Waring, "and I will see that she receives it." "Thank you," said De Vane. "Sit down," said Waring. "I took tea at Mr. Spring- i field's this evening, and he and Mrs. Springfield both enjoin-  ed it upon me to urge you to visit them. You must do so; it will be good for you in every way." "I go nowhere," said De Vane; " there is absolutely so much to do, that by the time I get through with a day's work, I am not fit for any thing."  "You will get on better with our systematic way of do-  ing things. Remember the wholesome motto, ' Festina lente.' An occasional visit to such a family as Mr. Springfield's will do you good in every way." "Well, I will go with you, and if you find. me becoming idle, you must admonish me. By the way, I heard Mr. Clarendon promise Mrs. Habersham that he would take you to see her.. What do you say to that?" "I am very much obliged to him, I'm sure," said War- ing. s"I should think her house a very attractive one." "Yes, and filled with works of art, I'm told. I met her at Mr. Clarendon's, some short time since. Miss Godolphin was with her, and was as splendidly beautiful as ever. But it is very strange that she seems to be so sad. I do not un- derstand it." "Did she appear so when you last met her?" "Oh! yes; more unmistakably than before." "I can not comprehend it. She must have suffered. She is certainly an extraordinary person."   DE VANE.          145 "Very," said De Vane. "She is brilliant. We must solve the mystery." "Take care!" said Waring; "she may be dangerous." "Just what Mr. Clarendon said; but she disclaimed it, in terms of sadness which absolutely impressed me with their earnestness. But I am trespassing upon you. Good night!" "Good night!" said Waring. "You're going to bed?" "Oh! yes. I am somewhat fatigued to-night." He entered his room; but he did not retire immediately. He sat before his fire in deep thought. The scenes of the day were before him-the grave of little Eva strewn with flowers, and the form of Esther bending over it, and be- dewing it with her tears. Even when he slept, the form of Esther floated before him, and seemed to rise heaven- ward, her face turned toward him, and smiling in the midst     CHAPTER XV.' t WINTER is worn that was the flowers' bale. And thus I see among these pleasant things Each care decay, and yet my sorrow springs.1" "ORD SURREY. SPRING opened gloriously.   Every vestige of winter was gone. Leaves, flowers, birds, all appeared. The air was balmy; the trees were vocal; windows were raised, and doors thrown open.   The town.-remarkable for its fine gardens, its shrubbery and trees-was full of sweet odors and cheerful sounds. Leasowes was beautiful; its shrubbery and flowers were never finer. The graveled walks and grassy slopes were delightful. The clear water filled the marble basin to overflowing, and the birds filled its shady recesses with joyous notes. The walks of the public garden were thronged; and nurses drew in Lilli- putian carriages, their little charges over its smooth walks. There is something in the smile of nature to awaken the soul. It cheers the rich and the poor alike; and unlike the luxuries of the artificial world, the flowers, the trees, the balmy air, and ,he music of birds, may be had without money and without price. The benevolence of God scat- ters, without stint, flowers in the wilderness; and the laborer in the fields may smell the sweet breath of the earth, and survey the wide expanse of woods and sky.

Thank God for the green grass, for meadows where cattle graze, for the glory of ripening grain and fruits, for the splendor of summer verdure, for the yellow autumnal harvests, for the stern magnificence of winter ! All nature utters her deep hymn of praise, and breathes her incense. Let the thanksgiving from human hearts mingle with the pure adoration of our MOTHER EARTH ! De Vane had become a regular visitor at Mr. Spring- field's, where he was sure to find a warm welcome. Mr. Springfield felt a highlrespect for him, and enjoyed his conversation, which took a wide range. He saw that the young Virginian was ambitious; but he saw, too, that he was generoup.  His aspirations were not for distinction merely, but for usefulness. Not for the applause of man- kind only, but for the richer applause of his own conscious- ness of deserving honors. - Too proud to stoop, the warmth of his nature made him enter, with ready sympathy, into the condition even of the poor and humble. Some of his warmest friends were among laboring men. There'was a stone-cutter employed upon one of the public buildings, a man of intelligence, with whom De Vane contracted a sort of intimacy. He was cutting a Corinthian cap, one day, as De Vane was passing, and the young student stopped to speak with him; examined the pattern by which the mnan was working, and explained to him the origin of that order of architecture, suggesting, at the same time, that the pattern was too stiff, and that it would be in better taste, if the leaves were somewhat more curved. The man, being one-of the head workmen, acted upon the sugges- tion, and finding his work greatly improved by it, was pleased. Ile became a fast friend of De Vane, and was in the habit of saying that the young student knew more      "8         DE VANE. about stone-cutting than he did. The blacksmith, who shod the horse which De Vane often rode, was very defer- ential, and did not hesitate to say that the young Vir- ginian could beat him at his own trade. Mr. Springfield found his range of reading so wide, that he declared himself always refreshed after an hour's con- versation with De Vane. They often spoke of Moral Science, and the depth of De Vane's views surprised him. He carefully avoided controversy with him; but suggested lines of thought which he knew would help to conduct the noble, ardent, truthful nature of his young friend, to the spot from which he could look out upon the harmonies of the realm of truth. Mrs. Springfield became much inter- ested in him. She learned from Waring his kindness to Mrs. Gildersleeve, and it deepened her respect for him. Highly cultivated herself, De Vane enjoyed her conversa- tion, and spoke with less reserve to her, perhaps, than to any one else, except Waring. He learned to venerate her true piety, and never, in her presence, uttered a word which could give her pain. His intercourse with Esther was delightful to him. She grew in his esteem, and her acquirements and accomplish- ments filled him with admiration. He learned one fact, which he had not discovered in their early acquaintance, that there was a deep enthusiasm pervading her character. He had thought her somewhat too grave, and possibly cold, when he first met her. He saw her passion for music, but even that awakened the thought that she might love that too well to be able to love any thing else with ardor. But he now observed, as he was oftener with her, that her nature was full of ardor-ardor perfectly well regulated, and under the dominion of reason and principle; but there was ardor. Like the soil which produces the finest grapes, there was a warmth which could not be felt on the surface, but which made its presence known by the fruit which it   DE VANE.          149 yielded, and diffused itself in the generous wine whicll ex- hilarated without intoxicating. He needed no urging now from Waring to induce him to visit Mr. Springfield's; and his friend smiled as he saw the change, but did not re- mark upon it to him, further than to say, that he was pleased to see him learning to prize good society. "Haven't I always done that, Waring?" he replied, when his friend made the remark to him. "Why, some time ago," said Waring, "' there was no in- ducing you to go anywhere, and you seemed to waste your sw^eetness either on your books, or in conversation with your friend Stiles the stone-cutter, or Hobbs the. blacksmith, or Swan the public gardener." ,' Now, Waring," he answered, " you know that I always would inflict myself upon you, and that I did visit Mr. Clar- endon's, from the first. You are not growing aristocratic, are you?" "Oh! no, not at all, but I thought you a little inclined that way; and I did not exactly comprehend your liking for the blacksmith, who does swear outrageously." De Vane laughed, and said: "Yes, I'm trying to break him of that habit. I tell him that it is not gentlemanlike, but he doesn't seem to feel the force of the appeal; for I heard him yesterday calling my horse some very hard names, because he did not choose to have one of his hind- feet held up in the air for thirty minutes." "You'll have to give him up, unless you reform him. But what do you say to our. calling this evening at Mrs. Habersham's?" "Quite at your service," said De Vane. "You have been there, I believe, once or twice?" '"Yes," said Waring. "Mr. Clarendon invited me to an evening drive with him soon after my return from Georgia, you remember, and we called on the, ladies. They were a     150          DE VANE. good enough to invite me to visit them, and I have been there once or twice since." "And how do you find Miss Godolphin? Is she still the queen of night?" "I do not comprehend her," said Waring; " but she is a very interesting person, and, if I do not mistake, she is a noble woman-full of character." "As to character," said De Vane, "she has enough of that and there is a fascination about her. Her beauty, her genius, her accomplishments, her sadness, invest her with a wonderful charm."  4 "So they do,"' said Waring. "She is a person, too, of great generosity; her appreciation of others is fine. She speaks of Miss Wordsworth in a way that is very pleasing." "She could not do less," said De Vane. "Miss Words- worth's qualities would awaken admiration anywhere; and her purity is such, that even her own sex must admire her." Yes," said Waring; "and do you know that though very unlike in person, both being impersonations of the highest but different styles of beauty, I think their organ- ization strikingly similar?" "Indeed!" said De Vane. "I think Miss Wordsworth the most cheerful-I may say, the happiest person I ever knew, grave as she generally is, while Miss Godolphin seems to be the very impersonation of sadness." "That does not prove a difference in organization so much as in circumstances. They are both cultivated, tho- roughly accomplished, full of enthusiasm, passionately fond of music, of great depth of character; but Miss Words- worth is a Christian -has never felt in her nature the awakening of human passion, and has never known disap pointment. Miss Godolphin has suffered in some way, in what way I do not know. Her pride must have been wounded, and she may have been deceived in some object of her regard. Her history during her stay in Europe is K.   DE VANE.          151 not known to -me. But she is a splendid woman of very noble nature. Of that I am sure." De Vane smiled, but said only: "I shall be pleased to know her better. You have interested me in her.?' "I learned to-day," said Waring, " that, hearing of the affliction of Mrs. Gildersleeve, the day after the funeral she drove to the desolate home, and passed an hour in conver- sation with the bereaved mother, and with great delicacy supplied her with articles of mourning. Esther's gifts and Miss Godolphin's have relieved every want of that kind, and your generous donation has made her altogether com- fortable." After early tea, the two gentlemen called at Mrs. Haber- sham's. It was a large brick mansion, built in the English style, the offices being in a range with the main building; and it was furnished in the most costly way. English car- pets covered the floors; the furniture, also imported, was massive and rich, and the walls were adorned with paint- ings-copies chiefly of the great masters. Miss Godolphin's father had married a younger sister of Mrs. Habersham. Both parents were dead, and Mr. Haber. sham also; and the two ladies, soon after the death of those who were so dear to them, had gone to Europe, where they resided for several years. Mrs. Habersham was wealthy, and Miss Godolphin's fortune was ample. The gentlemen were received at the door by a footman in livery, and shown into a drawing-room exquisitely fitted up. A grand piano-forte stood near the middle of the room, and a harp was not far from it, by which a chair was placed, as if it had been just occupied. Light chairs of different pat- terns were distributed over the floor, and two sofas, of graceful form, and covered with chintz, were on either side of the fire-place. On the mantle-piece, a French clock, rep- resenting Sappho leaping into the sea, was placed, and over it hung a portrait of Miss Godolphin, in the highest style     152         DE VANE.  of art. It was a half-length. The attitude was that of con- templation. The head, slightly drooped, rested on one of the hands; the hair, parted simply. in front, was gathered in a full band at the back of the head; the other hand held a Tuscan bonnet, wreathed with wild flowers, as if it had been just covered with these natural adornments; and the back-ground afforded a view of the sea. The picture was exquisite, of great merit as a work of art, and the likeness was striking. Waaring had never seen it, this being his first introduc- tion to this room; and he and De Vane were standing ob- serving the picture, when the door was opened, and Miss Godolphin entered. She received the gentlemen with warmth, and expressed her gratification at their visit, saying that Mrs. Habersham would soon join them. "We were observing your picture, Miss Godolphin," said Waring, " and we thought it every way a triumph of art." "It is thought to be so by all who have seen it," she replied. "It is the work, too, of an American artist." "That enhances its value," said Waring. Yes," she said. "I am intensely American. We found, in Naples, a countryman of ours who has been in Italy for years. He passed two years in Paris, and then went to Florence, afterward to Rome, and when we met him he had taken a villa near Naples, and was attracting large numbers of English and American travelers. He painted that picture." "He will return to this country, I suppose?" said De Vane. "That is by no means certain," she said. "His world is that of art. He paints but few portraits; but his favorite subject is, nevertheless, the human face. He has a picture of extraordinary power, representing Jephthah's daughter going out to meet her victorious father. The   DE VANE.         153 contrast between her glorious, exultant face, full of pride and joy, and the anguish which speaks from every feature of the hero, is wonderful." As De Vane looked at the portrait before him, he fancied that it might resemble the Jewish maiden after she learned her fate; but he did not venture to say so. "There is another of his pictures," she said, rising and walking across the room. It represented the'daughter of Herodias bearing the head of John the Baptist to her mother. The conception was original: the maiden bore the grand head upon a silver dish, and her averted face show- ed her horror of the act which she was performing under the injunction of her imperious mother. The form and face were superb, and the whole picture a great success. Departing from the usual ideal, the artist had given the maiden auburn hair and blue eyes. The rich, heavy ring- lets fell about the face, and the hair, gathered in a braid on the back of the head, was clasped by a golden serpent. Tears stood in the lustrous eyes, and tenderness touched the features, giving to the face a blended expression of anguish and compassion. The form was stately for so young a person, and a matchless grace was in the- attitude. De Vane was startled at observing, in the whole form and features, a close resemblance to Esther. She might have stood for the picture; and gazing upon it for some minutes in silence, he found his eyes moisten. There is wo derful power in a picture, and as De Vane stood before this,' he really was conscious of-an intenser interest in Esther than he was aware of before. He had never analyzed his sen- timents; he had formed no purposes; and he was startled to find himself so moved by a representation which asso- ciated her with a scene of horror and suffering. The real state of the heart is often disclosed to us suddenly. Itis especially so in great and generous natures. A dream, a leave-taking, a song, the presence of danger, or thy hand 7  .     164         DE VANE. of suffering laid upon the object, wakes up within us the consciousness of the depth of a sentiment whose existence we had not suspected before. Startled, alarmed, we wake to the real, where before we had been reposing in dreamy listlessness; and we realize what Comus experienced when he heard the music which arrested his steps, and filled him with wonder. "De Vane," said Waring, " do you find any resemblance between that form, and any of our friends?" ' It is wonderful!" exclaimed De Vane. "Of course," said Miss Godolphin, "I know that you see in it a strong resemblance to Miss Wordsworth. Do you know that it is so faithful, I am myself amazed at it? The first time that I met her, her face was perfectly fa- miliar to me. I could not recall it. She was so very young when I left for Europe, that I did not know her; but yet, upon seeing her upon my return, I found myself startled. I could not say why, but the thought that I had known her elsewhere haunted me; nor could I account for it until some two weeks since, when our pictures were brought home and unboxed. Then, when this was hung, I saw in an instant what had so long bewildered me." "It is very remarkable," said Waring. "It is positively wonderful," said Miss Godolphin. "If it were only that some features resembled, it might be ac- counted for by supposing it to be the meeting of the ideal and the actual in some accidental way, which I think often occurs; but here is every thing-hair, eyes, mouth, the bust, the very form; and, I repeat, it is nothing short of marvelous. The artist valued the picture highly, was re- luctant to part with it, and would not sell it to me; but as we had purchased several large and costly pictures from him, he presented that to me, saying that it would go to the very place where he desired to be known and appre- cilted by his works. s .    DE VANE.          155 "It is very strange," said De Vane. "A more perfect likeness I never saw. Can it be possible that the artist has seen Miss Wordsworth?" "Oh! no," she said. "He went abroad when shaewas a child." Do you remember, Miss Godolphin," said De Vane, "to have seen it stated that a man of science, having ob- :  served the effect of the dome of St. Peter's upon the be' holder, and thinking it perfect in its proportions, he resolv- ed to measure it? He did so. He tested the strength of the curye, and he found that the arch of the dome was the curve of greatest strength; thus making the discovery that the lines of beauty and strength were identical. Mi- chael Angelo sought for artistic effect in its construction, and that conducted him to strength; so that the dome is matchless." "The incident is charming," said Miss Godolphin; "and do you know, Mr. De Vane, that you have paid a very striking tribute to the beauty of Miss Wordsworth, by accounting for the resemblance which we all see, upon the principle that the artist pursuing his line of ideal loveli- ness, we find it verified by the real?" De Vane colored, and bowed. "But you need not be ashamed, Mr. De Vane, at the thought of having committed high treason against a lady in her own realm, by laying down the proposition that the perfection of beauty is to be found in a style wholly differ- ent from her own; for I quite agree with you, that Miss Wordsworth is perfect." "Pardon me, Miss Godolphin," he said. "In the human face, widely different styles may yet be perfect." "Thanks, Mr. De Vane," said she. "It is so gracefully atoned for, that you need not regret the treason." Waring and De Vane were both surprised. They had never seen her so bright.     156         DE VAN-E.  Mrs. Habersham came in, and renewed the welcome to the gentlemen. The conversation turned upon foreign travel, and Mrs. Habersham Ppressed her gratification at being once more at home, declaring that nothing could induce her to go abroad again. "It is a pleasure thatp promise myself," said De Vane, "and I should not willingly relinquish it." "Of course," said Mrs. Habersham, "you should go; nor do I regret having gone, but I would not tempt the ocean again." "To me," said Waring, "it would be very agreeable to visit Europe; but if I ever cross the Atlantic, I shall go to the East. It must be deeply interesting to trace the rise and progress of civilization, and to explore the coun- tries where the most important events have occurred. The Nile and the Holy Land would be irresistible to me, if there were no barriers between us." "I felt just as you do, Mr. Waring," said Miss Godolphin; "but my aunt and myself had no one upon whom we were willing to impose ourselves for s ph a journey. My uncle, who was with us, is an old gentleman, of confirmed habits, ! and loves his ease. He declared that the very idea of being subjected to the tender mercies of the outlandish people who hold those countries, once the seats of civil- ization, made him shiver, 'Then, too,' said he, 'where would one find cafe au lait for breakfast, and truffles for dinner?" "Yes," said Mrs. Habersham. "Yet Godolphin has lived so much in Paris and London, that he will never re- side even in this country permanently." "Very bad taste it is, I think," said Miss Godolphin. "England is to me intolerable, though most of my relatives are there. I love the vigorous, active, boundless life which opens before me in this young country."   DE VANE.         157 "-I rejoice to hear you say so, Miss Godolphin," said Waring. "Yes," said Mrs. Habersham, "Hortensia is thoroughly American, quite as much so as I am." "Still," said De Vane, "there must be much to admire in England; and social life is in perfection there." "Very far from it," said Miss Godolphin. "Of course there is refinement and cultivation; but there is a great deal of heartlessness too, and there must be where the social organization is so artificial and frigid." "I had not supposed so," said De Vane. "Some of our Virginia families find their chief delight in visiting Eng- land, and passing months with theirJ relatives in that country." "Yes," said Miss Godolphin, "I know it. The Guil- fords, for instance. But, Mr. De Vane, I do not sym- pathize with them. I am an American woman, and I re- joice in being able to claim such a country for my own. How I exulted in undeceiving them when on the Conti- nent! I was mistaken for an Englishwoman; and how they opened their eyes with amazement when I told them I was an American!" All laughed, and Waring said:      "You do not know, Miss Godolphin, how much pleasure it gives me to hear you speak in this way." "Oh!" said she, "I have no patience with women who come home from their travels, only to look with disdain upon every thing here, and to sigh for luxuries which they have left behind them." "You rouse my patriotism, Miss Godolphin," said De Vane. "I shall hope to return home, if I ever make my tour, as loyal as you are." "I do not doubt it, Mr. De Vane," she said. "You are too earnest to be captivated by any thing artificial, how- ever brilliant it may be."     158          DE VANE. "Thank you," said De Vane. "I shall hope to deserve your confidence." "There is one thing we ought to do, however," said she; " we ought to exert ourselves to cultivate the taste of our people, and to import every thing good that we can from abroad. I love my country, and I wish to see society here what it ought to be, exhibiting the only aris- tocracy worth calling by the name; a system that admits the true, the good, the cultivated, the men of soul and intellect, and the women of worth and culture, into its highest circle, no matter how humble their birth, or how poor their fortunes. An aristocracy of birth is simply ridiculous; for I have seen people of the very best fami- lies, as they are called, as vulgar and stupid as possible." Waring and De Vane both looked at her with admi- ration; she was so noble, so full of courage, so disinter- ested. She could afford to utter such sentiments without the fear of misconstruction, for her own family was really aristocratic. "Yes," she continued, "to see some of these specimens of noble blood, inferior in form, in mind, in manners, as- suming airs and treated with deference, has roused me so that I could scarcely be civil." "You are right, Hortensia," said Mrs. Habersham. "I have seen you at times when you were scarcely civil to some of the people we met abroad. Your uncle was dis- tressed." "Very sorry," she said; " but my American blood was up, and I could have defied the whole House of Lords." They all laughed heartily. Waring asked for music. Her whole aspect changed, and the habitual sadness re- turned upon her. "And do you love music, Mr. De Vane?" she asked. "'Passionately," he replied; "yes, passionately." She rose, and took her seat by the harp.   DE VANE.           159 "I will not venture to touch the piano this evening," she said. ' If I had Miss Wordsworth here to accompany meI should gladly do so. What a voice she has! I assure you that I have never heard it rivaled in so young a person. In four years more, if she cultivates herself, she will surpass any one that I know, on the stage or off it." She touched the strings; they breathed the sweetest harmony. The low tender notes were almost human in their utterance; and she sang: "When 'midst the gay I meet That gentle smile of thine, Though still on me it turns most sweet, I scarce can call it mine; But when to me alone Your secret tears you show, Oh! then I feel those tears my own, And claim them whilst they flow." She sang the entire song, and then, rising from the in- strument, seated herself near De Vane. le thanked her for the song, and spoke of the exquisite beauty of the figure-of the frozen snow on Jura's steep melting under a glance of fire. "Yes," she replied, " it is very beautiful. Mr. De Vane, you are young; you are ambitious, too, I know. Do not suffer your tastes to mislead you. You will go to Europe. I heard the Guilfords speak of you. Do be loyal to your country." "That I shall be," said he. "I am as thoroughly repub- lican as you are. My tastes in social life might lead me far; but as to my political principles, they are perfectly well established." "I am rejoiced to hear you say so. It is a grand thing to be a true man." After some general conversation, the gentlemen rose to i1     160         DE VANE. leave. Mrs. Habersham expressed' the wish that they would often visit her house; and with thanks for the invi- tation, they bade the ladies good-night. On their way to their lodgings, both expressed their admiration for Miss Godolphin. "Iehercule! Waring," said De Vane, "she is magnifi- cent." "Very fine," said Waring. "Really, a noble woman. How animated she was this evening!" "Yes," said De Vane. "I should like to see the-Alpine snow fairly melted." "What a republican she is!" said Waring. "I had no idea of it." "Nor I," said De Vane. "I supposed she was as aris tocratic in her ideas as she is in her appearance. I like her intense patriotism. We must see her often." Waring was by this time in deep thought, and De Vane walked by his side in silence. As they entered the house, Waring said: "De Vane, Miss Godolphin is the most extraordinary person I have ever known. We must see her often." "May she not be dangerous?" said De Vane, opening the door of his room. "Ah! you are quoting Mr. Clarendon," said Waring. "Good night!"   CHAPTER   XVI. Now, thanks to Heaven, that of its grace Hath led me to this lovely place! Joy have I had." WORDSWORTH. DE VANE had ordered, from the stone-cutter, Mr. Stiles, a monument for the grave of Eva Gildersleeve, and as he had not yet seen it since it was erected, he walked alone to the cemetery, that he might examine it. It was a little earlier than the hour when he usually took his evening walk with Waring, and it was some few days after they had made their visit to Mrs. Habersham's. He had not met Esther since; but she had been with him, in that spir- itual way which we have all experienced. In his day- dreams and night-dreams her form was before him. His interest in her had deepened strangely. Still he did not enter into an analytical examination of his sentiments to- ward her, nor had he formed any purpose in regard to her. Ambitious yet ardent, he had formed large plans for his future, and he had no thought of entangling himself just now in any way that might hinder their grandest devel- opment; yet he was conscious of the pleasure which he enjoyed in the society of Esther. She grew constantly in his esteem; and so completely had he come within the sphere of her attraction, that he found himself seeking her presence oftener than he had ever before,sought the society of any one. He selected books for her, and her library lrew under his contributions. He sketched for her, and (161)     162         DE VANE. in her chamber there hung several views of the Virginia mountains, which his own hand had produced. The cemetery was in the midst of a small forest of nat- ural trees, chiefly pines, and was on a gentle eminence that afforded a view of the soft Southern landscape that spread through the valley of the river and took in the hills be- yond it. It was a place of resort for those who had rela- tives or friends there; and strangers at times visited it, to observe the tasteful decorations which affection had be- st wed upon the graves of the loved and departed who slat there. There were a few very handsome monuments, and quite a number of smaller ones. De Vfane walked through the grounds, silent but for the songs of birds. They made the place vocal with their joyous notes, as if they would cheer the watchers over thos eo slept there; and sometimes, soaring heavenward, seeyed to invite them to look there for consolation. He found the grave of Eva. It was a grassy mound, and on the centre of it, a square, white marble block was placed, upon which stood a vase of the purest Italian mar- ble, encircled with the name of EVA GILDERSLEEVE. Through the letters a running vine was carved, bearing leaves and half-opened flowers. Mr. Stiles had shown great skill in carrying out the design which De Vane had handed to him. The vase was an open one, intended to receive earth, that it might bear natural flowers. De Vane stood looking at the work, and his mind re- verted to the evening when the little child who slept un- der the turf expired. Her sweetness, her faith, her tranquil leave-taking of the world-all came to view vividly. He saw, too, the group about the dying child-Esther clasp- ing the wasted little hand while she sang of heaven; and involuntarily he asked himself if it could be possible, that the spirit then beaming through the features, luminous even in death, could have ceased to live. He was lost in   DE VANE,         163 thought, and stood leaning against a tree. Suddenly he was roused by a step just at his side, and turnirg, he saw Esther. He started. Her presence was so unexpected, that she seemed to have come from the world of spirAts to solve the doubts which were gathering about his soul. She was dressed in white, and her graceful form appeared almost unearthly in its loveliness. "I did not know that I should find you here, Mr. De Vane," she said, " or I should not have ventured to disturb your visit to our little friend's grave." He instantly advanced, and gave her his hand. "Nothing could be more agreeable to me, Miss Words- worth," he said, "than your coming. I had not yet seen the monument placed over Eva, and I came to examine it." "It is very beautiful. I have seen it. I came last Sun- day evening with my aunt, and we both admired it greatly. Nothing could be more appropriate-flowers in- terwoven with the name. The design is, of course, yours?" "Yes; I was so impressed by the scene which I wit- nessed when she'died, that I would not deny myself the happiness of paying this little tribute to her memory." "We are all deeply indebted to you. She was an extra- ordinary little girl, as you saw, and her triumph was glo- rious. It was so serene; and I think, Mr. De Vane, that- the serene is most to be desired in our last moments." "Oh! yes; a calm death is always beautiful." "It realizes what is spoken so beautifully of the Christ- ian's death-- falling asleep in Jesus.'  De Vane was silent. "I have come, Mr. DeVane, to fill the vase with flow- ers-such flowers as will grow and bloom perpetually." She called a servant who stood near the gate, and he came forward with an earthen vase filled with earth and flowers, and taking it from his hands, she was about to transplant them into the marble vase.     164         DE VANE. "Allow me," said De Vane; " this must be a joint labor with us." She yielded to him. He took the earthen pot, and care fully transferred the contents to the marble vase. Esther directing the servant to brink some water from the little stream which ran near the pbt, she watered the flowers which De Vane had planted. Pausing for a few moments to look at their work, they turned away silently, and walked through the graveyard. The conversation natur- ally turned upon the scene about them. "To me, Mr. De Vane," said Esther, "this is a cheerful place. I look upon these hillocks as beds, where weary pilgrims are resting. But they will awake out of their sleep." "Do you know that you have almost literally quoted a line from the Swedish poet Tegner?- ' Where his fathers sleep in their hillocks green.'" "No, I did not know the line. But what is it but an- other rendering of our Lord's words, and of those of the apostles? After all, the Bible is the source of all beauty, as it is of all wisdom." "It is a wonderful book, and I read it with increasing admiration. I can scarcely comprehend how such a book as that called' JOB could have been produced in so early an age. Older than the poetry of Greece, it surpasses in sublimity any thing in Homer." "I am much pleased to hear you say so, for I know your admiration for the classics." "Oh! yes. I do not modify to, any extent my settled estimate of classical literature, but I have been aston- ished of late, in reading the book of Job, to find it so full of the sublime as well as the beautiful. 'Hast thou en- tered into the springs of the sea? Have the gates of 8v   DE VANE.         165 death been opened unto thee? Or hast thou seen, the doors of the shadow of death?' As if death were a dread monarch, whose lofty gates, yet invisible to mortals, threw their appalling shadow over the world. Then the glori- ous marshaling of the constellations in their nightly cir- cuits. 'Canst thou bind the sweet influence of Pleiades? or loose the bands of Orion? Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons? Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven . Canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?' The description of the war-horse is the noblest picture of the / kind in the writings of any age or people." Esther looked at him as he spoke with great animation, uttering the sentences which he quoted in a way to give  them their greatest effect, with admiration. "And do you not find," she asked, "in the New Testa. ment much to interest you? Is it possible to read the Evangelists without feeling their inspiration? Or to listen to the teachings of our Lord, with their gentleness, their purity, their spiritual power, without being thrilled and awed as if the Divinity stood in our midst? O Mr. De Vane! you mustsee that in the life and the death of our Lord, there is a higher sublimity than in all else, that has been made known to us. How immeasurably his teach- ings transcend those of men! What is there in the words of Socrates to rival them? He did not venture to teach positive truth. All he aimed at was an approximation to the true, the real, the immortal. And the fine specu- lations of Plato charm 'us by their beauty, but after all they are but speculations. In this wide world we need a sure guide, and when we approach the boundaries of the invisible world, we look for some strong arm to bear us up, and steady our tottering steps." Her face was radiant, as she stood for a moment and looked up to De Vane.     166         DE VANE. "The aspirations of humanity,". he said, "are such as you represent them to be, Miss Wordsworth. A traveler upon a wide plain, far from home at night, does not turn his eyes more anxiously to the heavens to see if he can find a guiding-star, or pause and listen with suppressed breath for some human voice, more earnestly than does man in his pilgrimage for some sure guidance. Life is full of dread mysteries. The future is the unknown." "Oh! not unknown. It is true we see dimly through the mists which surround us, but it is not best for us, while in this state of discipline, to have revealed to us too clearly the objects of a future world. But the future is not covered with impenetrable clouds. Through the rifts golden rays come, and upon this sea of life, tossed as it is sometimes with tempests, there is heard a voice which says: 'Be not afraid.' " "You are happy in your faith, Miss Wordsworth. Would that I could share it! But while I would not, if I could, disturb to the slightest extent the beautiful repose of your nature upon a base that seems to you so solid, I should be uncandid if I did not say to you how hard I find the task of submitting my reason to the dominion of any system which I do not comprehend. I see the beauty of Christianity, but I do not understand its great mysteries." "And do you not intend to seek to explore what is so awful in its relations to us? Surely you will not live so as to have it said of you, with all your rich endowment of mind, in the language of my namesake, William Words- worth  'The intellectual power through words and things Went sounding on a dim and perilous way." "I should be too happy," he said, "to be able to make my escape from a path which the Poet of the Lakes has so powerfully described; but how shall it be done? I stand   DE VANE.          167 upon a sea of doubt, and if I would borrow wings to bear me across it, I fear that, like those of Icarus, they would fail me, and leave me to perish in the waves." "You will perish, if you trust to any of the inventions of man. There is one book that teaches us the way to the invisible world, where the good of all ages will be assem- bled. The teachings of man will mislead us. The world is full of illusions; it deceives and flatters: but the Bible does neither. It teaches that even the best must suffer. It invites us to tread a narrow path, but it is a path which the true, the good, the heroic have trod. Suffering and tears have stained it; but the feet of Him who came to seek and to save that which was lost have consecrated it." They walked on in silence. The western heaven was resplendent. The clouds which floated through it seemed to be phantom ships, their sails illumined. The delicate opal spread wide above the deep orange that rested on the horizon. A single star glittered in the pure depths of bound- less ether. A shoreless sea of glory appeared to stretch beyond the visible objects. Esther stood gazing upon the glowing heavens. She seemed to forget the presence of De Vane. The lingering light played upon her features, and kindled a glory about her brow, such as the old paint- ers love to trace upon the head of the Virgin; and she uttered, in tones scarcely audible, those words, so full of consolation to a stricken world: "God is love." De Vane never forgot the picture. It entered his soul, and spread through it the light of immortal beauty. Upon the wide sea and in far distant lands, he often recalled it; and the words uttered by those pure lips, over which no earthly passion had ever breathed, sounded in his ears as if a celestial being spoke to him. Neither moved for some minutes. Esther then turned to De Vane, and said: b "It is time we should return."     168          DE VANE. They retraced their steps to the gate of the graveyard, where Mr. Springfield's crariage was drawn up, awaiting Esther. She invited De Varie to take a seat with her, and he, handing her into the carriage, entered it also ; and they drove away. When they reached Mr. Springfield's re- sidence, that gentleman came to the carriage to receive Esther, and seeing De Vane, invited him to go in with them and pass the evening. The invitation was accepted. It was the first time that he had taken tea in this way with the family. His evenings had frequently been passed there, but he had called at a later hour, and somewhat in a formal way; and as he took his seat at the table, he felt that he was now really welcomed into the unrestrained confidence of the house, as a friend. There is a charm about the ease and unrestraint of sitting down to a tea-thle in the even- ing with friends. It dissolves the little frobtt-work of cer- emony instantly; familiar topics spring up,-and we discuss in a genial way whatever interests us. The table was spread with luxuries; early fruits, straw- berries abounded, and rich cream, and snowy curds. Flow- ers were on the table, and they lent a refreshing air of re- finement to it. Mrs. Springfield did not disdain house- keeping, and the tastefulness of her establishment and the elegance of her entertainments were universally known. What a charm there is about such a home-! How the pic- ture comes up to us now of one in the far South, where purity and goodness, and unwearying kindness, and the patient ministry of self-sacrificing love, abounded! Tha presiding form is gone; the true, steady blue eyes are closed, and the busy hands gently laid across each other in the still sleep which will not last always! I  Esther sat opposite to De Vane, and never appeared more attractive. Her pure white dress was becoming to her, and in her rich hair she wore wild flowers, the long crim- son drops mingling with her curls.   DE VANE. ,          169 "Is it your first visit to our graveyard, Mr. De Vane?" asked Mr. Springfield. "Yes, my first." "We often go there, and find it any thing but a gloomy place. There should be more care bestowed upon it, and then I think it would be really attractive." "Yes, I think so. I was surprised to find so much taste. displayed in the tombs; for often one is offended by the neglected graves which he sees, or by the bad taste shown in their decoration.'"      * "I have often observed it," said Mr. Springfield; "for I make it a rule, in my travels, always to visit the burial- places of the cities, and even villages, where I stop for a day or two. To read the epitaphs is to me a source of endless interest."  "And how strange some of them   are!" said De Vane. "It is a department of literature which brings the ludicrous into sad juxtaposition with grief." "Yes; it is too true." "I was much pleased," said Esther, " with Washington Irving's description of Westminster Abbey. How impress- ive it must be to walk through it, to look down upon the marble forms of old heroes, stretched at full lenth; their faces upturned, their hands meekly closed, as if in prayer- in full armor, but the sword laid aside forever!" "It is the most beautiful of all his sketches, I think," said De Vane.   X "One epitaph which he mentions," said Mr. Springfield, "is singularly affecting. It is an inscription on a family tomb: 'All the brothers were brave, and all the sisters virtuous.'" " Very fine," said De Vane. "Far the most beautiful cemetery that I have visited," said Esther, " is Laurel Hill, near Philadelphia. At the en- trance, carved in brown stone, stands a group which arrests o     170         DE VANE. you at once: Sir Walter Scott-Old Mortality-and his pony. It is very appropriate, and gives an air of cheer- fulness to the grounds. The tombs, too, are pretty, some of them fine; and the Schuylkill winds silently by the grounds, as if unwilling to disturb the repose of the place." "It made the same impression on me," said Mrs. Spring- field. "I have never seen it, but I must do so," said De Vane. "Your description is a charming one." "What do you think, Mr. De Vane," asked Mr. Spring- field, ' of the manner of disposing of the dead by some of the ancients-burning the bodies?" "It has something to recommend it. It takes away the dreadful idea of slow decay, and enables the surviving friends to preserve the precious ashes in an urn, which may at all times be visited with satisfaction. But it must be appalling to see the remains of one dear to us suddenly and utterly consumed." "Oh! yes," said Esther; " dust to dust, as in our Christ- ian mode of interment, is the most consolatory mode, after all, of putting out of sight those we love." "Do you remember," said De Vane, addressing himself to her, "the scene described in regard to the remains of Shelley? He was drowned in the Bay of Spezzia, having set sail in his boat from Leghorn, where he had been to make a visit: a storm came on, and'all on board perished. When the remains were found, it was decided to burn them; and the act was performed in accordance with what it may be supposed would have been the poet's wishes.  Frankincense and wine, and other classical materials for burning, were used; and the flame arising from the pile was observed to be of extraordinary beauty. Lord Byron was present." "Poor Shelley!" said Esther, ".his life, death, and every thing seemed to be in harmony with nothing but the   DE VANE.      ,   171 ideal. But his friends were sensible enough to take his ashes, and deposit them in the Protestant burial-ground at Rome." "What a thrilling description," said De Vane, "Virgil gives of the death of Dido! She mounts the pile, made of objects dear to her by association, and yet filling her with anguish, and stabs herself before the flames are kin- dled, which fare to mingle the ashes of the cherished me- morials with-her own. tEneas, looking back from the sea, beheld the walls glowing with the flame from the funeral pile of the unhappy queen, whom his desertion had filled with despair." "What a picture!" said Esther. "IShe acted under the impulse of womanly passion, without the principles of a pure faith to guide her, or its consoling truths to sustain her." "To me," said Mr. Springfield, " nothing in connection with burying the dead is more impressive and touching than the conduct of Abraham in purchasing the cave of Machpelah, for the last resting-place of Sarah." "It is," said Mrs. Springfield, "exquisitely beautiful. The noble bearing of the patriarch, grand even in his grief, and with too profound a respect for the memory of his wife, to accept a burial-place for her as a gift." "Wonderfully fine!" said De Vane, "and it is to be ob- served how much importance the Hebrews, from the ear- liest time, attached to the spots where theirremains should rest. I was impressed with this, in reading, some time since, the account of the death of Joseph. So deep was his sentiment in regard to it, that he took an oath of his brethren, that they would take his bones with them, when they went up to the land 6f promise." "All the early nations," said Mr. Springfield, "had that sentiment, so far as we are able to learn any thing respect- ing them. The pyramids are tombs, undoubtedly."     172         DE VANE. "Speaking of the Egyptians," said De Vane, "reminds me of their mode of preserving the bodies of their dead, which I must say is to me hideous." "I entirely agree with you," said Esther, "and I like vaults as little. The earth-the fresh, dear, mother earth -is the true place where the weary should lie down to rest." "But you do not object to tombs?' said Mr. Spring- field. "No; but they must be light and graceful to please me. At least, the green grass and the wild flowers must spring and encircle the marble, and mark the outlines of the grave." "Except in the cases of great men," said De Vane; "then I think that grandeur should be the prevailing effect in the tomb." "I should make no exceptions," said Esther. "Death parts us from the great world, with its pomp and grand- eur; and while I should, of course, mark the spot where an eminent man sleeps, by some appropriate monument, I would surround it too with those simple things, such as flowers, which appeal to the common sentiment of human- ity, a love of the beautiful, and a clinging to nature." "But would you not break the impression, and mar the effect, in that way? The lofty column is to express the grand, the heroic; and if you associate with it objects of simple beauty, you lessen the veneration which the struc- ture is intended to raise in the breast. For instance, the tomb of Themistocles, at Athens, overlooking the sea, where his genius achieved its noblest triumphs, would be less impressive if the grass encircled it, or flowers entwin- ed it." "The artistic effect might be less," said Esther, "though [ am not sure of that. A contrast might be produced -which would serve to heighten the aspect of grandeur; but   DE VANE.         173 I would sacrifice something of that to a still higher ef- fect: the teaching that in death the purest sentiments of humanity are skred by the great and the lowly-the fondness for nature, and the love of the beautiful." "Then you prefer rural graveyards to the finest ceme- teries?" "Yes; but I would intermingle the objects of nature with the works of art. This is done at Laurel Hill, and will, I think, be carried out more perfectly as our country grows older." "I certainly hope," said Mr. Springfield, "that every thing will be done, that can be, to cultivate the taste of our people for the beautiful. We are in great danger of becoming too practical, and I confess my horror of the utilitarian philosophy. It is pleasing to see the dead cared for; and it must be a generous sentiment which strives to perpetuate the memory of the departed, who can no long- er serve us. And even if the display which we sometimes witness in elaborate tombs be intended as an atonement for neglect to the person while living, still it ought to be encouraged." "Speaking of country churchyards," said Mrs. Spring- field, "I think that some of the most touching testimonials of affection for the departed, are to be found in them. The green sod, carefully kept, and the ever-springing flow- ers, are simple but beautiful tributes." "And the impression which such a spot makes upon a person of refinement and sensibility," said Esther, "is shown in Gray's Elegy. That poem alone has made him immortal." "And ought to do so," said De Vane. "The sentiments are as noble as they are exquisitely expressed." "I am very impatient myself," said Mr. Springfield, "of any thing which perpetuates the aristocratic distinc-     174           DE VANE. tions of life beyond the grave, and I share Mrs. Spring- field's preference for rural burying-places." "It is a sentiment," said De Vane, " which every gener- ous nature must sympathize with; and the poetry of all ages shows this.  Shakespeare comprehended the superi- ority of natural adornments for the resting-places of the beautiful, the good, and the innocent. Laertes says of Ophelia: "ay her i' the earth; And from her f:air and unpolluted flesh May violets spring I'" "I well remember it," said Esther; " and the queen says, as she scatters flowers in the grave: Sweets to the sweet: Farewell! '" "Poor Hamlet!" said De Vane, " he could only exclaim: 'I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers Could not, with all their quantity of love, Make up my sum.' His love was too intense even for the tribute of flowers!" "It is often so in deep grief," said Mrs. Springfield. "But when the grief is somewhat softened, then we come with our offerings. Then we plant the sweetest flowers, and re-visit the spot from time to time, to train them." "One of the most perfect odes in the language," said De- Vane, " is, by some law of association which I do not ex- actly comprehend, recalled to my memory by your- re- mark; it is by Collins. He pays a tribute to the brave, sinking to rest amidst the blessings of their country--they sleep-and le says: 'When Spring, with dewy fingers cold, Returns to deck their hallowed mould, She there shall dress a sweeter sod Than Fancy's feet have ever trod.'    DE VANE.          175 "It is perfect," said Esther, with enthusiasm. "Nothing of the kind can be finer. The dewy fingers of Spring- cold-returning as if her sole mission were to dress the sod under which the brave sleep. Ah! Mr. De Vane, after all, my auntfs country churchyards do seem very sweet rest- ing-places." "Yes," said De Vane, "nature triumphs over. art; land however we may be attracted by the artificial in healthl and prosperity, our tastes must become purer as we feel the hand of the destroyer upon us, or experience any great calamity." "And yet," said Mr. Springfield, "Lord Nelson exclaim- ed, upon going into his last battle, I believe: 'Victory or Westminster Abbey!'"  "Yes," said De Vane, " he was in health, and felt the excitement that a brave man feels when going into battle. His ambition blazed with all its intenseness. But when he received his wound, which he felt to be mortal, his tender sensibilities triumphed, his affections asserted their sway, and he spent his last hours in making some provision fir the woman whom he loved." Esther's face glowed with interest. The extreme beauty and felicity of the criticism :which De Vane uttered, she saw clearly, and, turning to Mr. Springfield, she said: "I think Mr. De Vane is right." "If you both take part against, me," said he playfully, "I must consider myself vanquished; but instead of sur- rendering to either of you young people, I shall lay my arms down at the feet of my wife, for I believe she first suggested the superiority of country churchyards, while you were both disposed to have them a good deal embel- lished by art." "Very gallantly done," said Esther. "My aunt deserves the trophies." "I shall use my authority, then," said Mrs Springfield,     176          DE VANE. "if a triumph is decreed me, to invite you all into the library, where we shall find it mole agreeable, peihaps, than here."' She rose from the table, and they all followed her. There was an indescribable charm about this house. A refined taste presided over all its arrangements, and De Vane never visited it without feeling refreshed, as one does upon quitting the dusty plain to walk in the midst of gar- dens. He sat for an hour longer, conversing with Mr. Spring- field upon subjects of public interest-for both were ob- servers of the actual, living world, much as they loved books; while Mrs. Springfield and Esther employed them- selves with some light embroidery-work, of a pattern just introduced from Germany, and occasionally took part in the conversation. Happy hours! Time glides by without reminding us of his flight. Happy homes! where the duties of life are not overlooked, and where the heart and the intellect are both improved; where taste presides, and all that is good in our nature is cheered and invigorated; where books, and music, and cheerful conversation close the day, and give to each passing evening the tribute of genial natures.    CHAPTER XVII. "TnHgs, thanks to thee, my worthy friend, For the lesson thou hast taught! Thus at the flaming forge of life Our fortunes must be wrought-- Thus on its sounding anvil shaped Each burning deed and thought!" "ONGFELLOW. THE summer vacation of the College was drawing near. The annual examination of the classes was about to com- mence, and the unusual increase in the number of the stu- dents induced the Trustees to think of adding another member to the Faculty. Hitherto no very marked atten- tion had been bestowed upon studies which had a theologi- cal tendency, It is true moral philosophy had been taught, and well taught, and natural theology had not been over- looked; but no decided training was given' to those in- quiries after revealed truth which every one who compre- hends the claims of Christianity to any extent must feel to be so transcendently important. The religious sentiment of the State began to look into this subject, and to inquire into the reasonableness of bestowing more attention upon studies which should in all Christian states be recognized as of the highest importance. And while it was not de- sired that a strictly theological school should be opened in the College, such as would fit young men for the ministry, yet it was insisted that every young man who came to that seat of learning, now so renowned for its scholarship, should be instructed in that department of knowledge which it 8*        (177)     178         DE VANE. became every gentleman to understand as a part even of polite education. The great argument, so longL urged, that it was best not to make religious instruction a\part of education, because it might give a bias to the mind of the student in favor of some particular creed, had been explod- ed; and it was said, in reply, that the soul was like the earth-if no cultivation were bestowed upon it, no seed planted which might yield good fruit, it would surely send up noxious weeds and poisonous berries. In support of this view, the great name of Lord Brougham was quoted. That nobleman, statesman, and scholar had written power. fully in support of strengthening the bonds of society by a wider diffusion of knowledge, and he argued in favor of spreading along with the elements of science the elements of moral truth, as eminently conservative. Happily for England, the argument prevailed there, and the prosperity of the empire is largely indebted to this system. The mind of England is instructed in divine truth, and the heart of England is filled with Christian sentiment. Her cross of St. George not only is emblazoned on her victori- ous standards, but her rulers learn to respect the authority of the Supreme Ruler. She proclaims her trust in God everywhere-it is the national sentiment. Walking in the streets of London, in the very midst of the busiest mart of commerce on the globe, one reads, with a glow-of ad- miration, upon the facade of the new Exchange the words: "The Earth is the Lord's, And the fullness thereof." This is a part of public education, and the lesson is not lost upon the people. Proud Empire! wherever thy flag floats, Protestant Christianity goes with it. - Happily for this country, the same sentiment is in the hearts of many of the people; and in those States where simple and evangelical truth is best known, there the prin-   DE VANE.          179 uiples of free government are best understood and the or. ganization of society is least disturbed. We do not desire to see in this country an Established Church, but we do wish to see CHRISTIANITY recognized as the basis of our institutions. Happy is that people whose God is the Lord! Appreciating this sentiment, the Trustees, at their next session, provided a chair for a Professor of Sacred Litera- ture, whose duty it should be to teach Biblical learning and the Evidences of Christianity. Waring was young, but he was well known to the Fa- culty and the Trustees, and he was unanimously elected to the new chair. He conferred with De Vane in regard to it. "It was my wish," said he, "to pursue my studies with- out interruption, and to fit myself for the work of the min- istry as rapidly as possible-I mean the regular itinerant work; but I confess the offer of this place does draw me powerfully. It will enable me to carry out some of my plans sooner than I could otherwise do it--that is, to travel in Europe and the East." "Do not hesitate a moment," said De Vane "it is the very place for you. Of course I have too mnuc respect for the sacred office, and too much regard for you, to venture to obtrude any counsel upon you in reference to such a question; but if you will allow me to say what I really do think, without attributing to me presumption, I will do so." "My dear De Vane, you are at liberty to speak to me freely upon any subject, and I shall be glad to hear your views." "Then, Waring, I think that the new Chair is the place or you. I am not prepared to judge of the field of use. iulness which the traveling ministry opens; but with my knowledge of you, I do not hesitate to say that the College     180         DE VANE. will afford you a theatre for the exercise of your highest qualities. There are many who can instruct the people, but fitness for such a place as the Trustees have just now originated is rare indeed. And if anywhere the great principles of truth ought to be taught well, it is certainly in those places where young men are trained for life." "The traveling ministry requires very high qualifica tions," said Waring, "far higher than I can lay claim to. A preacher in that wide field meets persons of all classes- the high and the low, the rich and the poor, the learned and the unlearned-and he ought to be able to meet the wants of all. You, of course, remember Mr. Springfield's description of St. Paul, his discourse on Mars' Hill, at Athens? That will give you some idea of what an itiner. ant preacher has sometimes to encounter. Such a work demands a Wesley, a Whitefield, an Asbury, when its larg- est requirements are met." "You must not understand me to underrate the work of a traveling minister-far from it; but the ordeal of a life in a college is a very severe one. The learning, the win- ning manners, the dignity, the firmness, the nameless qualities which constitute a gentleman, and which no mere scholarship can confer-these I know you to possess, Waring, and you must not withhold them from our Col- lege." "I'm very much obliged to you," said Waring, smiling; "and I am, of course, gratified to witness your interest in the success of the new chair." "Oh!" said De Vane, laughing, " you know my taste for such studies; and if I do take a wider range in my re- searches than you think exactly safe, still I wish to see the place well filled, andI love the College." "I must think of it," said Waring, "and confer with Mr. Springfield about it."  "I'm sure that he will agree with me," said De Vane.   DE VANE.         181E "Then, Waring, we shall have you here en permanence, and that, I think, would settle the question as to my making it my home." "That would be very agreeable to me. We -both like the place, and I do not know that we could find one in all the world that has more attractions." "It is full of them. Cultivated people abound here; the society is remarked for its refinement; and every win- ter brings us the first men of the State, who come here either as members of the Legislature, or to attend its ses- sion." "Well, let us take our walk," said Waring. They walked in the direction of the river, and in their way passed the shop of the blacksmith, whose ringing blows upon the anvil saluted the young gentlemen as they drew near. "There is your friend hard at work, De Vane. He is an industrious fellow." "Yes, and something of a philosopher in his way." '"How are you, Mr. Hobbs?" said De Vane, stopping in front of his door. The sparks flew as the blacksmith brought down his heavy hammer upon a piece of glowing iron which he had just taken from the forge. "Pretty well; thank you, sir," said he. "How d'ye do yourself?" "Always hard at work, it seems to me. You never rest, do you?" "Of nights, and Sundays," said the blacksmith, shaping his iron with quick strokes. "Life's short, you know, sir, and there's a heap of work to do." "Yes, but what time do you take to read?" asked IDe Vane. "Why, you see, sir," the blows falling thick and heavy upon the piece of iron, which now began to take the shape of a horse-shoe, "these days are pretty long, and that nig-     182         DE VANE. ger-boy who works with me ought to have a chance to rest in the middle of the day; so I bring a book with me, and my dinner, too, and so I get about an hour. Then, at home, about another hour after supper, and of Sun- days, all day."           ' "What are you reading now?" asked De Vane. He gave a few more sharp, quick strokes with his ham- mer, cut off the shoe from the bar of iron, and plunging it into the fArnace again, wiped his face with a towel that hung near, and, stepping to a shelf, took down a book and brought it to De Vane. It was an illustrated copy of Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. "There," said he, "there's a book that my wife's been reading, and she asked me to read it. I've got nearly half through, and it's an uncommon book." Waring smiled, and said: a Do you find it interesting?" "Oh! yes, sir-interesting enough. It's as good as a book of travels." "The journey that the Pilgrim is making," said Waring, "is a very important one." "Yes," said the blacksmith, " and he's a brave fellow. I think he'll get through. He's not afraid of the devil himself." De Vane was a little uneasy. He feared the blacksmith might become too animated in his descriptions. Waring managed him very well. "You observe, however," said Waring, "that he wore good armor, and had a good sword." "Oh! yes," said the blacksmith, " he had that all right. That was a desperate fight he had with that fellow Apol- 1lyon. I thought, when he straddled out over the whole road, that Christian was in a bad way; and so he would have been, if he had backed at all. But when I saw him draw his sword, I knew he had pluck in him, and I felt   DE VANE.         183 sure that he'd do to depend on; and, sure enough, he gave the fellow thunder." Waring smiled, and De Vane laughed heartily; but the blacksmith was too deeply interested to observe the effect produced by his remark. "You observe," said Waring, " that Christian was a man of courage. That's very true, but do you know what gave him courage?" "I suppose he was naturally a man of grit," said the blacksmith.            ( "Not only so," said Waring, " but he believed that there was One much greater than himself, who was able to protect him if he kept on his way; and you know, too, that he was going to the city where his great Friend dwelt." ' Oh! yes," said the blacksmith,(" it helps a man mightily to know that he's on the right road and well backed; but the man must have the real stuff in him to fight against heavy odds." "When you have finished the book, Mr.'Hobbs," said Waring, "I should like to talk with you further about it." "Very well, sir; I'd like to see you. My wife asked me to read the book. Miss Wordsworth gave it to my little girl last Christmas; and my wife is a member of the same church with that young lady. She says the book's inter- esting, and I think so too. She'll read any thing that Mrs. Springfield or Miss Wordsworth asks her to read; for she believes in 'em." "Well, Mr. Hobbs," said De Vane, "I shall send my horse round to have that right shoe behind rasped. He cuts his ankle."                   e "Yes, sir, d9. The infernal rascal won't stand still long enough to let me fit his shoes; but I'll put it right. He's a fine horse, but he's got the spirit of --" "Well, never mind," said De Vane, quickly. "You'll     184         DE VANE. rasp the Shoe a little on the inside. Don't take the trouble to change it. Good evening." "Good by, gentlemen," said the blacksmith, walking up to his furnace, and grasping his iron bar. The young gentlemen, as they walked on, soon heard his ringing strokes once more. "The blacksmith is a character," said Waring. "His industry sets an example worth following." "Yes," said De Vane, "there is to me a charm in such a scene-a stalwart fellow, shaping iron with lusty strokes, and full of independence and cheerfulness. I sometimes call at his shop to talk with him." "I see that he is a friend of yours. His running re- marks upon the Pilgrim interested me. They are pert and natural. The idea that Christian would have been over- come if he had backed, was capital; and his opinion that it helped a man to feel that he was well backed had pith in it." "I should like to hear him review the whole book when he has finished it," said De Vane; "it would be far more entertaining than many lectures that we hear." "I feel a strong sympathy with such men," said Waring. "What a respect the man has for his wife! She is a gen- uine Christian, and Hobbs knows it; and it is beautiful to see the ascendency which a pious woman acquires over such a man; strong, courageous, manly, honest, and yield- ing meekly to the admonitions of a mild woman. O De Vane! I wish the Christian world saw this more clearly. There would be far more toleration for unconverted men of high qualities than we witness now. With all the O  faults of that sturdy smith, and with his proneness to swear, yet I feel a respect for him. He is respectful to his wife, tender to his children, and would fight for any cause that he thought good." "Yes, there is nothing of meanness in him. His heart is   DE VANE.          185 large, and he is fond of books, which .gives me a fellow- feeling for him, rough as he is." "Such men almost certainly come under religious in- fluence. Their very frankness disposes them to receive great truths with favor.' "I find myself benefited," said De Vane, "by my visits to his shop. The energy with which he brings down his hammer is positively exhilarating, and the perseverance with which he takes up a rough piece of iron, and shapes it into some implement for agriculture, or a shoe for the foot of a horte, never fails to teach me a lesson. I go from him with firmer resolve to shape the affairs of life with vigor, and I find myself roused to new ardor and activity. The truth is, I have a sincere respect for a laboring man: he is the pioneer of civilization; his strong arm and honest heart are powerful in forming society, and building up a state." "Yes," said Waring, "a thousand times greater respect than for idlers and drones, who, because they have the means of living without labor, fancy t the exemption from toil constitutes them gentlemi "Gentlemen," said De Vane, "mut possess the quality that Cicero says is essential to an orator.:- Yo of course, remember his remark, that no one but a good man could be an eloquent one, upon the principle that he must rouse the higher qualities of our nature, if he would move us by his oratory; and while I regard the social distinctions ol life as of very great importance, yet I am quite ready to admit that you may find gentlemen in all classes. It would be a great calamity if it were not so. One who is honest, has self-respect, and is considerate of the feelings of others, is a gentleman, no matter where you find him." "I never heard a better definition anywhere, De Vane. I approve it heartily. Cicero's definition is not so feli- citous, though he may have intended to embrace some-     186          DE VANE. thing more than to live honestly, or rather honorably, by his phrase." "As to what the world calls honor, it is wholly unre- liable; it is artificial and heartless. The code is frigid, and some of the worst men on earth profess the greatest regard for it." "I thoroughly agree with you," said Waring. "I could point to one or two such instances. A gentleman is a gentleman always, with the code or without it. The code of honor restrains some men undoubtedly, who would act, much more mischievously without it than they are allowed- to do in view of its penalties; but a gentleman is a true man, whose real refinement and nobleness no code can express."                 - f "Yes, the quality that makes a gentleman belongs to the inner man," said De Vane. "A gentleman always yields the best room to a lady at an inn; gives her the most comfortable chair; sees that she has access to the fire; considers her feelings, by saying and doing nothing whichY can offend her sensibility; spares a poor man every mor- tification, and treats a little child with kindness. A gentle- man spares the weak and confronts the strong. He go- verns his life by the proud maxim of the great empire: ' Parcere subjectis, et debellare superbos.'"  "In short," said Waring, "he has very thoroughly studied the thirteenth chapter of the First Epistle to the Corinthians." "Waring," said De Vane, " here we are upon the river- bank. Just here we met Mr. Springfield first,you re- member." "I very well remember it," said Waring. "It seems but a short time, and yet it has been months. Let us make them a visit this evening; the sooner I advise with Mr   DE VANE;          187 Springfield in regard to my affairs, the better; for I must decide promptly." "I am quite at your service," said De Vane. They retraced their st-ps to Mrs. Bowen's, and after tea they made their visit to Mr. Springfield's. The moment they entered the house, Mrs. Springfield came forward, and said with animation: "Mr. Waring, I congratulate you. We are all very happy to learn that you are to take the new chair in the College." "I came to talk over that matter. Is it already settled?" "' Definitively and irreversibly. Mr. Springfield, Esther, and I, all say so. Are we not right, Mr. De Vane?" "Perfectly so, madam," said De Vane. "I do not see that Mr. Waring can hesitate about it. We have gone over the ground together already, but he reserved his decision until he could hear Mr. Springfield's views." ' "He will join us in a few moments; he accompanied Esther to make a call, at the hotel, on some friends of ours from Georgia, who are on their way to the North, to pass the summer at some of the watering-places. They will soot be in.' "And yo think, Mrs. Springfield, that I ought to accept the professorship?" "I have not the shadow of a doubt about it. 'If I had been called on to arrange a plan of life for you, I could not have more satisfactorily accomplished it. Tthere is every thing to recommend it. You will make your influence ' felt in the best way, and your tastes will be gratified with- out any sacrifice of your sense of duty." "That is just the point," said Waring, " where I am not clear. The place would be so agreeable to my tastes, that I can hardly feel, in deciding to accept it, that I am not yielding to my inclinations, and shrinking from the rougher path of duty." -     188         DE VANE. "Mr. Waring, you know my interest in the great work. I wish to see it prosper; but I assure you that the want of our Church at this time is men who can influence senti- ment in the higher circles of life." Waring was silent for a minute or two. The view just presented had not been overlooked -by him, but he feared that, in entertaining it, he was encouraging his own wishes. Now that it was brought before him so directly, and by one so much esteemed by him as Mrs. Springfield, he felt it in all its force. Who has not found himself guided aright by some woman of sense and character, in a moment of doubt or hesitation? There is an unspeakable satisfac- tion in the counsels of a true woman. The heart is loyal, the perceptions clear, the mode of presenting truth capti- vating; and he who has for a friend such a woman, may safely trust her when the strength of men would fail, and the wisdom of men would be at fault. O woman! loyal, noble, courageous, generous womean! may we never want thy words of sympathy to cheer, nor thy counsels, unself- ish and true, to guide us! At this moment Mr. Springfield and Esther came in, and they both tendered their congratulations to Waring. Esther seated herself without removing her hat, and was very animated. "So, then," said Waring, " you all say that I must accept?" "There ought not to be the slightest hesitation," said Mr. Springfield. "The subject is not new to me; I have long considered it. In my judgment, the traveling minis- try is very important; the beneficent results of the system can not be overrated: but there are other departments of the service, where certain qualifications are demanded, that can not be readily supplied. To suppose that no one can labor properly or effectively but in the itinerant work, is so extravagant, that it is not worth oui while to consider   DE VANE.          189 the question in that light. To say so, would at once ignore the' usefulness of the ministry of every Church but our own; and neither you nor I can consent to do that." "Of course not," said Waring. "Besides this," continued Mr. Springfield, "the Meth- odists of this country ought not to limit their aims to a mere control of the popular mind. Our doctrines are in- contestably sound. We must bring the higher classes under their influence: the cultivated, the learned-these we must deal with. We already number in our ranks such persons as you very well know; but it is not to be denied, that our access to that class is difficult. Oar influence over per- sons of taste and refinement must be increased, otherwise our children will depart from us; and as society becomes matured, other churches will take the control of the learned and cultivated classes, leaving us to perform the task of pioneers." "Certainly," said Waring; " the Methodists of England are acting upon your views, and their influence is spreading over the higher classes." "You are quite right, and it ought to be so. Methodism was born in the first university in the world-Oxford. It was patronized then by Lady Betty Hastings; and her sister, Lady Margaret, married one of the Methodists who accompanied Mr. Wesley to Georgia. Her sister-in-law, the Countess of Huntingdon, after experiencing the power of the doctrine taught by them, became the friend of Whitefield, and cooperated with the Methodists, through- out her long life, in the most marked and energetic way. In her Chelsea mansion, near London, where the most aris- tocratic and fashionable circles were habitually met, she established a place for preaching; and it is a. remarkable fact, that when Whitefield preached there, the first people of the realm assembled to hear him. Chesterfield heard him there, and invited him to his chapel at Brathy Hall.     190       I  DE VANE. His wife, and her sister, the Countess Delitz, both accepted the faith as taught by him, and died in it. Horace Wal- pole, Hume, Bolinghroke, and others, heard with admira- tion the eloquent evangelist; and Lord St. John, a brother of Lord .Bolinghroke, became a convert to the doctrine' which he preached, and died- in the hope of the Gospel. A prayer-meeting was established in London by ladies of the highest rank. The Marchioness of Lothian, in declin- ing health, the Countess of Leven, Lady Balgown, Lady Francis Gardiner, Lady Jane Mindard, and Lady Mary Hamilton, formed a part of the company, the meetings being held alternately at their houses; and they werts continued for years. "Subsequently, in the most aristocratic quarter of Lon, don, the meeting was conducted by the Countess of North cote and Hopetown, the daughters of Lord Leven, the Countess of Buchan, Lady Maxwell, Lady Glenachy; Wil- helmina, Countess of Leven, with her sisters, Lady Ruth- ven and Lady Bauff, Lady Henrietta Ho}i, and Sophia, Countess of Haddington. It was but a day or two since, in looking into some strictures upon Methodism, in the Edinburgh Review, I was induced to tAe:up the Life and Times of Lady Huntingdon, by a member of the House of Shirley and Hastings, where I find the account given at length. By the way, it is a book which will interest you greatly. It was sent to me from Philadelphia, and is at your service." "I shall read it with great interest," said Waring. "The notices which I have seen of it have interested me. It is believed that if political troubles had not driven Lord Bolinghroke "to the Continent, he would have yielded to the power of evangelical religion. It is unquestionably important that our seats of learning should be made ac- quainted with it, and I did not at all underrate the import- ance of the place which is offered me; but really, it wNas   DE -VANE.         191 so tempting, that I felt some distrust of my own judg- ment." "But now," said Esther, " you will accept it?" "I do not see," said he, " how I can do otherwise. It is only too pleasing to me to do so; that makes me doubt its being my duty." "The path of duty," said Mr. Springfield, "is not always rugged." De Vane had been an attentive listener to the conversa- tion, and his respect for Mr. Springfield and for Waring was heightened by all that he heard. Both were earnest, both took the largest view of/he question, both divested it of its personal relations, bbth decided in reference to considerations which even the great Task-Master might see without disapproval. The question was now settled. Waring was to take the new Chair in the College. 4,     CHAPTER   XVIII. "SOME woes are hard to bear. Who knows the past? and who can judge us right?" ROBERT BULWER LYTTON. SOME days after Waring's interview with Mr. Spring. field, having fully made up his mind to accept the Pro- fessorship to which he had been elected by the Trustees of the College, he called on Mr. Clarendon to thank him for his kindness in having brought about that result; for that gentleman, being a member of the Board, and know- ing the preeminent qualifications of his young friendfor the task, had brought him forward in such a way as to concentrate the entire vote upon him. "You owe me nothing, Mr. Waring," said Mr. Clarendon. "I love the College. I came to it, from Virgifia, a young, ardent man. My heart expanded in the College, my mind grew and strengthened there, and I am zealous for its honor and success. I was not willing to see our new Chair filled by a mere professional teacher of religious doctrine. I wished something higher. I knew well your qualifica- tions, your sincerity as- a Christian, your thorough scholar- ship, and your character as a gentleman. I beg you to consider me your friend, sir, and, at the same time, a friend to the College." Waring was deeply impressed with the frankness and generpsity of this speech. He said: "I can only assure you, Mr. Clarendon, of my wish to serve the College faithfully, so that I may do mny duty, (192    DE VANE.          193 and continue to enjoy your friendship and confidence, which I have long prized." 'Mr. Clarendon gave him his hand, made him a stately bow, and asked him to take a seat-they were standing in the library. It was early evening, and the windows being thrown open, the western sky was in-full view. The horizon was yet glowing, and the western breeze came freshly through the shrubbery, which had not yet lost its sweetness. Pedestrians were enjoying the fine, fresh air, and carriages rolled through the handsome streets, filled with ladies without their hats. The capital wore its bright- est summer aspect. The two gentlemen were in conversa- tion, when Mrs. Habersham  and Miss Godolphin drove ulf in a light, open carriage, and without alighting from it, sent the footman to ask if Mrs. Clarendon would join them in their drive. Mr. Clarendon walked to the carriage to  answer the invitation, stating that Mrs. Clarendon had gone, but a  little while before, to drive with her sister, Mrs. Hallam. "Will you not, ladies," said he, "come in, and await her return?" ' Oh! no," said Miss Godolphin, " we must continue our drive; and I  think, Mr. Clarendon, that you had better join us." "With all my heart," said he gayly, "provided you will permit me to bring a young gentleman with me. A proper man, I assure you." "It will only increase our pleasure," she said. "Then we shalljoin you in a moment."  And returning to the house for Waring, they advanced to the carriage. "Allow me, ladies," said Mr. Clarendon, "to present to you Professor Waring, of the College which you see just over the way there. You have known him as a gay young gentleman, a hard student, and a first-honor man. You aie now to respect him as a grave Professor. 9 " -      E        v      194         DE VANE. The ladies smiled, and bowed to Waring, as if much im- pressed with his new dignity; and the gentlemen took their seats in the carriage. "So you accept the chair, Mr. Waring?" said Miss Go- dolphin. Waring bowed. "Yes," said Mr. Clarendon, " we gave him no chance to decline. The Board elected him and forthwith adjourn- ed, appealing to his well-known love for the College, to induce him to accept." "We are very much pleased," said Mrs. Habersham, "to learn that Mr. Waring is to be with us. I feel quite an interest in securing such acquisitions for our society." "Nothing," said Waring, " could be more agreeable to me, than such an arrangement. I love the College, and I love the town." "And of course the people in it," said Mr. Clarendon. "Of course," replied Waring, " and the people in it. I should be very ungrateful if I could be indifferent to them." "Where is your friend Mr. De Vane, Mr. Waring?" in- quired Miss Godolphin. "We were wishing to meet you both." "It is impossible to say," replied Waring, where Mr. De Vane is to be found at this moment. He had walked out when I called for him some two hours since, and it  may be that this fine evening has tempted him to seek recreation in the public garden after a day's study." "Yes," said Mr. Clarendon, "I'll venture to say that he is about this time holding a professional conversation with his friend Swan, about the cedars of Lebanon, -or the hys- sop on the wall, or some new plant just introduced into the public garden. Swan thinks him a prodigy, and has no idea that King Solomon was at all better instructed in any department of knowledge than De Vane."   DE VANE.         195 The ladies laughed, and Mrs. Habersham instructed the coachman to drive to the garden. "Our object at this time in seeking Mr. De Vane, is to invite him to join us to-morrow evening. To-day we were quite surprised at receiving the card of Mle. Yesperini, a celebrated cantatrice whom we met abroad. She is here but for a day or two, and we wish some of our friends to enjoy the pleasure of meeting one who may be called the queen of song." Mr. Clarendon and Mr. Waring expressed their gratifi- cation. The carriage was approaching the garden. It was thronged with visitors. Gay groups were seated and en- gaged in animated conversation. Others filled the broad walks. As the carriage drew up opposite one of the prin- cipal gates, De Vane and Miss Wordsworth emerged from it, and observing the party who had just arrived, they ap- proached them. "Ah!" exclaimed Mr. Clarendon gayly.  "Mr. De Vane, like your great progenitor, you have just quitted the garden abounding with delights. Not expelled, I trust! But at least, like him, you have an angel to walk ly your side." Esther blushed deeply. 'Yes," replied De Vane, "with such a guide, I am content to explore the great world." "We are fortunate in meeting you, Mr. De Vane," said Miss Godolphin, "and to find you, too, with Miss Words- worth. We called at Mr. Springfield's for her, as we set out to drive." Esther expressed her regret at not having been at home to receive the ladies. "Not at all," replied Miss Godolphin; "it is far better as it is. We are to receive, to-morrow evening, Mle. Ves- perini, a celebrated cantatrice, and I lay my commands \      196         DE VANE. on you, Mr. De Vane, to escort Miss Wordsworth. You are both indispensable, and you must come together." De Vane bowed, and said that with Miss Wordsworth's permission, he would undertake to execute Miss Godol- phin's command. Esther expressed her approval of the arrangement, and the carriage dashed on. "How fortunate," exclaimed Miss Godolphin, "I met the very persons I most wished to see! They will enjoy Mile. Vesperini's singing." ".There are no two persons," said Mr. Clarendon, "who will appreciate it more." "Do you know, Mr. Clarendon, that I think musical people deserve the highest honors? In Europe, especially on the Continent, they take rank with the nobility. They are guests of princes. People of the highest rank receive them into their houses as fiiends. It is the homage that wealth and rank pay to genius." "Yes," said Mr. Clarendon, "when in Europe, I often observed it. In Ireland, I met at the house of Mrs. Grant, of Laggan, a young Irish lady of extraordinary accom- plishments. She was fascinating, and her singing was unrivaled. On the Continent, too, I more than once met families from Ireland, and the ladies were in every in- stance superior." "This lady is very young-certainly not yet twenty- five," said Miss Godolphin; "and she is attended by an uncle-a man of good fortune, who glories in the celebrity of his young relative. He was with her when I met her in Paris." "In that respect," said Mr. Clarendon, "the taste, or rather the conventionalism of Europe differs widely from our own. Persons of position and wealth suffer their rela- tives to enter public life in a way which we should utter- ly condemn. Their love for the fine arts is such, that it gives art an elevated rank. ^ Mrs. Siddons was not only   DE VANE.         197 received everywhere, but she was sought, and sought eagerly, in the most aristocratic circles. And even when the stage proper is condemned, that is, the theatre, persons of genius are encouraged to appear in public as artistes, in song, in recitation, or in reading." "I think well of it," said Miss Godolphin. "Genius should always be tributary to the advancement of so- ciety." "There is a great deal of stiffness in this country," said Mr. Clarendon, "and the avenues to distinction are too few. Politics is almost the only pursuit for our men, and our women have none. Especially ought we in this South- ern country to encourage such entertainments as Mrs. Habersham proposes to give us. They are innocent, and they must, while they prove entertaining, give to society a heightened refinement. We do not encourage the stage; indeed, we proscribe it, and I think very properly. It be- comes, therefore, a high social duty, to contribute in some other way to the development of genius and the advance- ment of art." "I am delighted to hear you speak in this way," said Miss Godolphin. "Our entertainments are generally flat, stale, and unprofitable. What we call parties, are often intolerable. Dancing may do for very young people, but surely not for those who have grown to any consciousness of what a serious affair life is. And then what have we left?" "Nothing but music and conversation," said Waring; "but they are every thing." "Yes," said Miss Godolphin, "I enjoyed myself more at your entertainment, Mr. Clarendon, given to the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, than any thing of the kind I have attended in this country." Mr. Clarendon bowed. "I think, Miss Godolphin," he said, "that receptions     198         DE VANE. where guests of congenial tastes are expected to call through the evening, and where only light refreshments are introduced, far more rational than large entertainments, where every thing is done upon an extravagant scale." "Oh! and a thousand times more agreeable. In Paris, and Brussels, and other capitals on the Continent, no other evening entertainments are known, except occasionally a great ball." "The ambassadors give their dinners," said Mr. Claren- don, "to the gentlemen; and the receptions are really re- freshing, for they bring together people of taste, and cul- tivation, and refinement; and conversation goes on in a way perfectly charming." "We must try to make our little capital very agreeable, Mr. Clarendon," said Mrs. Habersham, "and next winter I shall do what I can in that way." The drive was a delightful one, and the carriage draw- ing up before Mr. Clarendon's door, he took leave of the ladies with thanks for such an agreeable hour. Waring accompanied them to their residence, and Mrs. Habersham insisting that he should not walk, the carriage took him to Mrs. Bowen's door, where he was warmly re- ceived by that good lady, who was delighted to observe his growing intimacy with Miss Godolphin. De Vane and Esther, after quitting the party in the car- riage, walked leisurely to Mr. Springfield's. "Iow animated Miss Godolphin is becoming!" said De --ane. "Waring and I passed an evening there lately, and we found her really bright." "I have observed it. She is very fascinating. I can not account for the sadness which we sometimes observe in her; but even that heightens my interest in her. When ahe forgets her sorrow, she is brilliant." "The suddenness with which she relapses into sadness,"   DE VANE.          199 said De Vane, "is strange. It is like a cloud suddenly passing over the sun." "Or a bright particular star," said Esther, "becoming dim by some fleecy vail, which the eye can only perceive by the lessening radiance of the orb." "Your figure is perfect," said De Vane. "It is nothing known to us, which can explain the fact; but it is still a fact, that, at times, when Miss Godolphin seems bright- est, she suddenly sinks into dejection. She is a person, too, of such. intellectual strength, that it makes it the more difficult to account for, and she is not at all capri- cious. Her opinions are fixed, her tastes are pure, and her character is resolute. There is some painful memory, pro- bably, known only to herself, which throws its shadow across the path of her life. She is a wonderfully interest- ing person, and I should be glad to see her happier than she seems to be." "If there be any secret sorrow," said Esther, "it must have been caused by something that befell her in Europe. Her history, up to the time of her going abroad, is well known; and she was then as bright and joyous as possi- ble, having nothing whatever to cloud her happiness but the loss of relatives." "It is beautiful," said De Vane, " to see her when she is animated. She is magnificent, splendidly beautiful, and full of graceful majesty. She looks a queen." "I have often thought so," said Esther. "She is singu- larly free from affectation, and her unstudied attitudes have at times startled me by their classical beauty, and, I may say, sublimity." "The Guilfords, of Virginia," said De Vane, " were with her in Europe. I have heard her speak of them, and when I make my visit to that State, which I think of doing next month, I may be able to find a solution of what is certain- ly a mystery."  n     200         DE VANE. "You go to Virginia next month?" said Esther. "Yes, I must make my father and aunt a visit. It has been my purposb to do so for some months. Almost three years have gone by since I saw them, and it is proper that I should make them a visit which they think has been already too long delayed." "It is certainly proper," said Esther, "and must, I think, make you very happy." "It will certainly be pleasing," he said, "to revisit rela- tives so dear to me, and to see the spot where very early years were passed. But I do not feel that Virginia is my home. I do not know how it is, but this is the only place in all the world where I would consent to live. It holds me by a powerful attraction; and no matter where I may be, when I quit here I shall feel that I am an exile." He spoke with great animation, and his face beamed as he uttered the words. "But," said Esther, "may not a return to your Virginia home revive the slumbering attachment to that place which has been so dear to you?" "No, said he, " never. I honor and love Virginia, and cherish ancestral recollections: but here I have been for the first time conscious of my own faculties; here I have received the Promethean heat which wakes me to con- scious manhood; here I have learned to turn upon the world and survey it, to compare places, study society, and know for myself what it is all worth. In my native State, I should be involved in all the meshes of conventional- ism. The very fact of residing upon an estate which has come down to me through more than one generation, while it conferred consideration, would commit me to all the rules which society there recognizes as so imperious, and I could not be myself. If I had never gone from home, it might have been different; but it is too late now. I have seen the world in its largest outlines. I have learned to   DE VANE.         201 despise its little conventional ways. I would to-morrow relinquish my claim to my estate before I would consent to hold it and ignore my manhood." Esther was startled by his earnestness. She had never before seen him so roused. She did not know that he had lately received letters from home, appealing to his ances- tral pride, and urging him to return and fix his residence in Virginia; that Mrs. Vane, after some playful criticism upon his own letters, in' which he had betrayed more plainly than before his admiration of Esther, had warned him against being ensnared by his Methodist friends, who might be good people enough in their way, but who could not, of course, be suitable to his matured tastes, or do for intimate associates; and had at some length, and with evi- dent seriousness, portrayed the charms of the beautiful Clara Guilford, and hinted at the advantages which such an alliance would yield him. He continued: "I am not unambitious, but I trust that the passion with me is an honest and honorable one. I desire distinction, but it most be earned-not inherited; earned, too, by a career of usefulness-not bought with money, nor obtained by the mean arts which degrade so many public men. I am satisfied that the dearth of high qualities which we must all acknowledge, is the result of the conventional rules of life, now becoming so strong in this country. Vigor and manliness are disappearing. Wealth is worshipped. The high places of the Republic are looked to as the rewards of the abject followers of some petty popular potentate, and the very road to the unseen world which we are assured awaits the good, is hedged in by aristocratic forms, which make no provision for the poor and the outcast. I wishl to be a man. I will not consent to be dwarfed by the forms of society." He was splendid in his enthusiasm. Esther had never before seen him roused in this way. His very form seemed , 9*     202         DE VANE. to dilate with the grandeur of conscious manhood, and his youthful, vigorous frame seemed fired by an. inspiration which it could not contain. She had never looked into the  nature of the interest which she felt in De Vane. She was conscious of a very deep interest in him. She had never loved, and she had never before met one who even roused her admiration. De Vane had never spoken to her of love, had never even hinted it to her; but she, of course, had seen that he sought her society, and his admiration for her was too marked not to be observed by herself, as well as by others. Mrs. Springfield had seen it, but had never spoken to Esther on the subject. Comprehending her well, she knew that it was not at all required; for while she knew her ardor, she knew too that she possessed self-con- trol, and would never permit herself to become too deeply interested in any one, until she ascertained that her sense of duty would suffer nothing from the attachment. War- ing, too, had been very attentive to Esther, and she be- lieved that her niece felt a certain interest in him. She thought it unnecessary to speak to her about either. Now Esther was troubled. She was really agitated by the consciousness of her sympathy with De Vane, and she turned her eyes upon him for a moment, lustrous with the ligoht of her awakened soul, and could not restrain a glance of boundless admiration for the nobleness of the sentiments which he uttered. He walked by'her side for some mo- ments in silence. Neither could venture to speak. De Vane was at that moment conscious of an intenser regard for Esther than he had ever before experienced; but he was not prepared to speak to her of his sentiments. They were not, indeed, sufficiently defined, and he had no present purpose in regard to her; though, if he had analyzed his heart, he might have found in its depths the wish to walk by the side of the gloriously beautiful being who was with him now, through all the paths of future life.   DE VANE.          203 Yet he had great respect for his father. He would be reluctant to wound even his pride, to- offend his aristocratic tastes; and to say to him that he, his son, wished to take for a wife this young disciple of a despised sect, this daugh- ter of a Methodist preacher, who even now resided in the family of a lay preacher of that denomination, would, he knew, shock him greatly. If he could see Esther first, if he could know her worth, her splendid intellectual endow- ments, her accomplishments, her great soul; if he could but be made acquainted with her, without learning in ad-. vance her religious sentiments or her connections, he was sure that all would be well. But there -was the trouble: how could this be done? The problem troubled him. Then, too, his aunt. Her pride of birth, her aristocratic tastes, her earnest wish to see him lead the life of a Virginia gen- tleman-all this troubled him. He himself comprehended Esther. He knew how superior she was to allothers with whom he compared her, and he despised the paltry consid- erations that others esteemed so weighty. He had no pres- ent purpose; he could form none. He must visit his home, survey the ground, test his interest in Esther, before speak- ing to her. That soul, which he knew jhad never been wakened by the voice of human passion, must not be roused until the voice of true and immortal love broke its pure slumber. The star of hope must not rise in the heavens, to be ob- scured by mists, but must mount the skies when they were serene and cloudless. "I am to call for you, Miss Wordsworth, to-morrow evening, you remember," said De Vane. "Yes," said Esther." "I wish to hear Mle. Vesperini. I have long desired it. She is said to be peerless in song." "I share your enthusiasm," said he. "You know my love of music; but your singing has spoiled me for that of any other person."     204         DE VANE. "I thank you for your appreciation, but I fear that I am indebted only to your kindness. You are too generous to be critical." "I plume myself upon my taste," said he playfully; "and nothing but something like perfection can satisfy me." They had reached Mrs. Springfield's residence, and De Vane, declining Esther's invitation to go in, bade her good evening, and walked away. He found Waring seated in the piazza with Mrs. Bowen, awaiting his return. "I hope you -had a pleasant drive, Professor," said De Vane. "It could not be otherwise," replied Waring, "surround- ed as I was; and I need not inquire as to your walk. If it had not been agreeable, you would not have lingered so long on the way." "Delightful!" said De Vane; " but have I been long?" "Mrs. Bowen has been waiting tea for you-I will not undertake to say how long." "Never mind, Mr. De Vane," said the good lady, per- fectly happy in the presence of her two favorites. "Mr. Waring has just come in, and as he came in the carriage of course he got home first." a   CHAPTER XIX. "A BBEATHLESS awe, like the swift change, Unseen but felt, in youthful slumbers; Wild, sweet, but uncommunicably strange, Thou breathest now in fast-ascending numbers.' SHELLEY. THE cloudless splendor of a summer evening favored the musical entertainment to which Mrs. Habersham had in- vited her friends. There was a delicious coolness in the air, peculiar to a Southern climate after the fervors of the day have declined; and the evening breeze, fanning the shrubbery with which the town abounded, bestowed a fragrance which nothing but natural flowers could impart to it. What a tribute to the senses, when sweet odors mingle with sweet sounds! The South is the home of both; and m  every household under our brilliant skies, flowers and music should be cultivated. Glorious land, lying midway between the frozen north and the burning tropics, may thy people ever encourage the industry which covers thy fields with fruitful harvests, and the arts which shed refinement upon thy happy homes! The parlor, which had been open to receive the guests, was pretty well filled when De Vane and Esther arrived. They had driven to Mrs. Habersham's, and Mr. and Mrs. Springfield were to come at a late hour. Miss Godolphin received them with animatio  and ex- pressed her gratification at their presence. "I would cross the Atlantic myself," she said, "to hear noble Vesperini." ,(205)     206          DE VANE. "So would I," said Esther, "most gladly, if she be what she is represented to be in the musical world." "No description can do her justice," said Miss Godol- phin. "She has genius, soul, cultivation. One must have all to be perfect." Mr. Clarendon advanced, and said: "Ah ladies, we are to have a great treat to-night, a foreign wonder, as Comus said, when entranced by music from some unseen fair one; but I shall be slow to believe that you will have to lay your garlands at her feet." "Wait till you hear her, Mr. Clarendon," said Miss Go- dolphin. ' She is really a wonder; and you will be ready to exclaim with Comus, I am quite sure: 'Can any mortal mixture of earth's mould Breathe such divine enchanting ravishment?" "I have been ready to make that exclamation, De Vane, about Miss Godolphin and Miss Wordsworth any time these six months past. Yet I'm bound to believe them mortal, when I recover myself sufficiently to reason about it." "Ah! Mr. Clarendon, you are very cruel," said Miss Godolphin, " to turn your satire upon us in this way. Is he not, Miss Wordsworth?" "Satire!" said he. "Upon my soul, I was never more sincere in all my life. De Vane, have you not heard me often say something very like this?" "Something very like it," said De Vane; " and it was only last evening that you pronounced, me fortunate in being under the guidance of an angel." "I did not suppose, Mr. De Vane," said Esther, "that you would take part against us." "But, in all seriousness, ladies," said Mr. Clarendon, "I do not expect to hear any music from this celebrated   DE VANE.         207 Mle. Vesperini at all more pleasing to me than I have heard from each of you within a month. After all, music is not mere artistic skill, that may heighten its effect; but there is in the living voice a power to move the soul, which no instrument, however cunningly touched, can ever rivaf' "Quite true," said Miss Wordsworth; "but it is said that Mle. Vesperini's voice is perfection." "That may be," said Mr. Clarendon, " artistic perfec- tion, but a voice must possess a living sympathy if it wake the soul." t"' Thatls the peculiar charm of this lady's voice," said Miss Godolphin; " she is what may be called eloquent in song. You know how much we have admired that, in Miss Wordsworth's singing. And I predict for her greater success than Mle. Vesperini has attained, if she will be loyal to the art." Esther flushed, and De Vane said: "I beg, Miss Godol- phin, to lay my tribute at Miss Wordsworth's feet too. When her grand triumphs come, she will remember us as her early friends." "So you are coming over to my position," said Mr. Clarendon. "To make my triumph complete, I shall say that I long ago discovered the yet undeveloped powers of both these ladies; the one before her visit to Europe, and the other some twelve months since." The room was nearly filled, and among those who had just entered was Waring, upon whose arm a lady of ex- traordinary beauty was leaning. She was the daughter of Dr. Dahlgreen. Almost majestic in the fair proportions of her youthful but well-developed figure, she was very graceful, and attracted attention by her sweet manners. Her eyes were very fine, full of expression, in which soul and intellect were blended. She had just returned after an absence of some months, having been on a visit to a      203         DE VANE. married sister residing in the upper part of the State. Miss Godolphin went forward to receive her, not having met her since her return from Europe. Esther informed De Vane of this, and explained to him that she was well known to his friend, Mr. Waring. "I never heard him speak of her," said De Vane. "It is strange." "O1! no," said Esther," she has been absent for months, and you have been in society so little, that you have not met her." "Ah! yes, she must have left the town last winter." "Yes, in November, I think"' said Esther. "We all admire her greatly, and I am glad to see that she has re- turned. Let us speak with her;" and, advancing to the group about Miss Dahlgreen, Esther and herself greeted each other warmly. De Vane was presented by Waring, who said: "This, Miss Dahlgreen, is my friend, of whom you have heard me speak." She bowed gracefully to De Vane, who said: "You must have come to town to-day, Miss Dahl- green, as I had not heard of your arrival." "Only to-day," she said, "and I sent for my friend, Mr. Waring, to escort me, when I found that my father would not be able to accompany me." At this moment, Mile. Vesperini entered the room, and came rapidly to Miss Godolphin, attended by her uncle, who walked behind her. She was very animated, and bowed low, speaking with marked gentleness in her tones, which, even in conversa- tion, were very sweet. She was just the medium height, a little disposed to what we style embonpoint, but well formed and perfectly graceful. The sweetness of her man- ner was winning; and as she threw a glance about the room, she seemed to spread light through it. Her hair   DE VANE.          209 was brushed back from her face, and gathered in heavy rolls on either side. A wreath of green leaves encircled her head, and rich curls fell from the back part of it on her neck. Her dress was of white silk, small flounces of lace covering it nearly to the waist, and a brilliant necklace of emeralds encircled her neck. Several gentlemen, with ladies on their arms, were pre sented to her, and Mr. Clarendon took charge of her, and conducted her through the room. Very soon after her arrival, the doors of a large room opposite the parlor were thrown open, and the tables were seen covered with fruits, flowers, and iced cream. And from time to time parties entered it and partook of the re- freshments. "What impression does she make on you, Mr. De Vane?" asked Esther. "She is very bright," he answered, "and I am pleased. Has she real warmth, do you suppose?" "I should think so," said Esther; "but it is impossible to judge her so soon. She has musical eyes. Did you ob serve their color?" "No," said he. "Are they not dark?" "Oh! no; they have a greenish hue, which is said to be observed in all great singers." "Indeed!" said De Vane. "I must observe her mor closely. Your theory is a new one to me. I do not dis cover it in your eyes." And he looked down into theii glorious depths. "Yours are the purest violet I ever saw.' "Are they?" said Esther, blushing. "Then I fear that I want the magic color." "You want nothing else, then, to make you peerless in song. Do you know that you bring tears to my eyes be- fore I am conscious of it?" "Certainly no higher tribute than tears can be paid to music," she said.     210          DE VANE. Waring came up with Miss Dahlgreen. "We have just been presented to the celebrated canta- trice," said Miss Dahlgreen. "Will you not speak with her?" "Yes," said Esther, "we intend doing so. Do you find nor agreeable?" "Very much so," she answered, "very much so. Her face is a very sweet one." "Let us speak with her," said De Vane; and advancing with Esther to the chair where she was seated, Mr. Claren- don presented them. Mlle. Vesperini rose from her seat, and bowed with marked cordiality to them. Esther's beauty impressed her, and she could scarcely restrain her exclamations of pleasure. "And do you reside here?" she asked. "Yes," said Esther. "And is this your native place?"  "No," said Esther, "Georgia is my native State; but I have been here nearly all my life." "Ah!" said Mlle. Vesperini. "You are so English- I should have pronounced you English if I had met you in any part of the world but here. Here one meets the several races represented, and that, too, in perfection," she said, with a bright smile. "Miss Wordsworth," said De Vane, "has near relatives in England, as most of us in this country have." "Ah! yes," she said, " it is so. I find them everywhere. And is Miss Wordsworth related to the poet of that name?" "Yes," said Mr. Clarendon, "quite nearly, I think." "I had not learned that before;" said De Vane. "You must visit Europe, Miss Wordsworth," said Mle. Vepperini. "It will delight you."   DE VANE.          2" "When I can do so," said Esther, "I shall be very hap- py to make the visit." "Go to Rome, Miss Wordsworth-go to Rome. There is the seat of the arts, as it was of empire for a thousand years!" She spoke with great animation. "Paris," she continued, " is gay-appreciative, too. Vi- enna is grand but cold; St. Petersburgh, magnificent but half barbarous; yet London is great but stiff. Florence- Naples-pictures in the one, palaces and the bay in the other; but Rome-Rome is imperial still!" "Bravo!" exclaimed Mr. Clarendon, with enthusiasm. "Bravo!" "You think with me, then?" said she, turning to him. "A thousand times yes," he answered. "I am happy," she said. "Go to Rome, Miss Words- worth, and' forget the degeneracy of every thing modern, except the arts. Go to Rome, and let music fill your soul and make you immortal." De Vane's face was bright, his enthusiasm was roused. Here stood a woman ablaze with the love of her art-the priestess of an art nothing less than divine-and urging another woman, whose beauty filled her soul with a strange ardor, to visit the temple where that art found its highest interpretation. "You have music in you," she continued. "I read your soul. You can interpret music-you can serve music Go to Rome-imperial, sublime, eternal Rome!" She was impassioned, and her face glowed with the enthusiasm for her art which flamed up within her. Esther, catching the fervor of the rapt priestess, was resplendent, like the Parsee in the presence of the sun, and she was conscious of a high sympathy with the extraor- dinary woman who stood before her. "I am curious to know," said Mr. Clarendon, "how you     212          DE VANE. made the discovery that my young friend is like yourself- full of music." "I saw it in her organization-heard it in her voice- read it as one reads the mysteries of an art which laymen never comprehend." Miss Godolphin came into the group. "Here, too, is one," said Mile. Vesperini, "whose soul loves music. If she had been European, she would have been an artiste; but in this new country, your civilization does nothing for the arts; you give them no rank, no rewards, no en- couragement. When Miss Godolphin was in Paris, I read her soul; but she would not listen to me. She had been to Rome-had heard the great artistes-and was then pur- suing the art with wonderful enthusiasm; but when I spoke to her of entering into its service, she shrank from it. Caste was roused; her nationality arrested her ardor; and she refused to enter a temple where the glories ot heaven fill its highest dome." "I well remember your friendly interest in me," said Miss Godolphin, " nor can I ever forget it." "Friendly interest! It was my love for music. I would have led you to the shrine, where you should have minis- tered forever." Professor Niles and his wife came up to the circle which had gathered about Mle. Vesperini, and they entered into conversation with her. They spoke of the great musical celebrities of Europe, with whose fortunes they were familiar. Malibran was mentioned. "She is angelic!" exclaimed Mle. V esperini. "She has just reappeared in Paris, in the grand opera, Semiramide. She is glorious! Poor child! she came to your country to find a sad fate. She should never have married." "But," said Miss Godolphin, " she did not marry an American. Malibran is a French banker in New-York."   DE VANE.         213 "Ah! you vindicate your country, just as you were ac- customed to do in Paris," she said, shaking her brilliant fan playfully. "Artistes must not sell themselves. If you could have heard Malibran as I heard her in London, when she first appeared, in the part of Rosina in II .Barbiere de Seviglio, you would have pronounced her divine. She was just eighteen. Ah! artistes should never sell them selves. Gold may buy talent of any kind, but genius- inspiration-never!" She uttered the last words with startling energy. "No," said Miss Godolphin; "the best part of our nature can never be bought." There was a deep tenderness in her tones ; and the lashes fell over her large, dark eyes. "Do you return to Europe presently?" asked Madam Niles. "Yes; in a month. I go first to Ireland. To me, Ire- land is every thing in the summer. However it may be with others, that is my season. My home is just on a lit- tle lake, that to me is more than the ocean." "Your country," said Professor Niles, " is very beauti- ful. Its rural aspect was to me enchanting, especially where, from its coves, one, could catch glimpses of the sea." "If my country were like yours-free," she said, "it would be glorious." "You like Paris?" asked Madam'Niles.  "Yes. It is brilliant. To pass the gay season there is every thing. You meet all the world; and nowhere else is the opera alive, but in Paris. But I would not make it my home; rather would I pass from Italy to Ireland, and from Ireland to Italy again, taking Paris en route." "We heard of you in Florence," said Madam Niles, "but did not have the pleasure of seeing you. It was four years since."     214          DE VANE. "Ah!" exclaimed Mile. Vesperini ; "I was there studying pictures." "So we were," said Professor Niles; "and one might pass a lifetime there in that pursuit." "Florence is very pleasant," she said, "for one who wishes to rest; but there is no life there. It is to me but a dreary spot." Then turning to Esther, she said: "You will at some time visit Europe? Go while you are yet young-before your fervor is at all chilled-and while the love of art is a passion with you." "It is not at all certain," said Esther, "that I shall go abroad; but if ever I feel that I can do so, I shall remem- ber your counsel." "It is possible, Mle. Vesperini," said De Vane, "that I may cross the Atlantic some time next year, and it would be very agreeable to me to meet you in Rome. My ven- eration for the Eternal City is not less than your own." "Alh! I shall be very happy to meet you. I shall expect you next year?" "My plans of travel are not at all settled," he said; "but I have such a tour in view as would take me into Italy some time next year." "Cross the Alps in October-not before, not after- descend into Italy in October." At this moment, the doors opening from the parlor into the small drawing-room where De Vane and Waring had been received upon their late visit, were thrown open. Its exquisite and graceful adornments impressed every one. The instruments of music, the pictures, the tasteful and rare furniture, the profusion of natural flowers, lent it an air of enchantment. "Oh! how charming!" exclaimed Mle. Vesperini. "This is Parisian." De Vane offered her his arm, and conducted her into p   DE VANE.         215 the room. She declined to be seated, but stood looking' at the objects of art; which were distributed with fine taste and met the view everywhere. Mr. Clarendon advanced, with Miss Dahlgreen on his arm, and invited her to give them some music. With perfect grace she bowed, and took her seat at the harp, touching the chords lightly. She changed the tone of two or three of them, and then asked Miss Dahlgreen if she would prefer any particular song. "I wish rather," Miss Dahlgreen said, " to leave that to your taste." Esther stood near, with Waring and Miss Godolphin, and she observed with pleasure that Mr. Springfield and her aunt, with Mrs. Habersham, were favorably placed to enjoy the music.      / Mle. Vesperini, with a low, tender touch to the strings, sang from the Italian, Domini O me .Felici, the liquid tones blending with those of the instrument, and pro- ducing perfect harmony. Every word was distinctly ut- tered, and the sweetness of the voice was indescribable. When the song ceased, so perfect was the stillness in the room, that the rustling of the dress of the cantatrice, as her arm, falling from the strings, rested upon it, was the first thing that woke the audienceth consciousness. She did not attempt to rise, but smiling to Esther, she desired her to come to her. A murmur of applause went round the room, and Miss Godolphin, turning to Waring, said: "That is music." "Yes," said he. "Miss Wordsworth," said Mle. Vesperini, "I am about to sing again. You heard me speak of Madame Malibran: would you wish to hear something from the opera in which she sang when I first heard her in London?" "I should be delighted-thank you," said Esther. "I will sing it for you," said Mile.-Vesperini. "I am sure that it will please you. I sometimes sing it in public."     216         DE VANE. Again she touched the strings, and this time with more power, and she sang. The full, glorious volume of sound floated out in the air, sometimes rising in strength and fill- ing the room, and then sinking with a gentle, prolonged cadence, as if melting into silence, until at the close a burst of passionate energy died away into a tender, almost wail- ing sadness, that entered into the soul, waking its deepest sympathy. "O Mile. Vesperini!" exclaimed Miss Godolphin, "how you have interpreted music this evening! I feel as if I never comprehended its power before." She smiled and bowed. Quite a number came to thank her; and as Esther did ro, her eyes dripping with tears, she could only whisper: "Thank you!" "The tribute of your tears to the music, Miss Words- worth, is the highest that can be paid." She spoke as if she were really the mere interpreter of the art, and she accepted the homage everywhere offered her as if it were due only to that. She was but the priest- ess at the shrine, standing in the midst of the worshipers. She was about to rise from her seat, when Mr. Clarendon came to aslk her to sing something in our own language. She yielded at once, and asked him if he would name something. He appealed to Miss Godolphin, but she ad- vised that it should be left to Mle. Vesperini's own pre. ference. "Then," said she, "I will go to my country. I will find something in Irish song to,express what I feel for Ireland." Sweeping the chords of the instrument until they seemed to breathe with sadness, she sang, with a depth of pathos that could not be surpassed, Moore's lines describing, in touching eloquence, the condition of his illPgoverned country- "The harp that once through Tara's halls;"   DE VANE.  *       217 and as she poured her soul into the song, she. transported all who heard her with her own passion. The eloquence of the utterance /was irresistible. The manner in which she gave the intenseness of her sentiment to the two clos- ing lines was startling. ' "Bravo! Bravo!" exclaimed Mr. Clarendon, approach- ing her as she rose from her seat, while a storm of applause greeted her on every side. De Vane was electrified. His eyes blazed with enthusi- asm, and he exclaimed: "That song is in the language of sadness; but the very voice of lamentation over departed glory, if it could be heard throughout Ireland, would rouse her sons to deliver, or perish with her." Mle. Vesperini caught the words as she was passing, and bowed low to him. Every one spoke with animation of the performance, and as Mr. Clarendon took Mile. Ves- perini to the refreshment-room, he expressed his own high appreciation of her music. "I enjoy it myself," said she. "Music is to me every thing. Oh! I should be so desolate without it." "Miss Wordsworth," said De Vane, "do you observe that painting?" They stood in front of the large picture representing the daughter of Herodias bearing the head of the Baptist to her mother.  Esther stood in perfect silence for some moments. "It is very wonderful," she said. "It resembles a picture of my mother, which I have, as closely as if one were copied from the other. It is very, very wonderful.!' "It is a perfect likeness of yourself," said De Vane; "perfect-features, form, expression, every thing." She became very pale. "'I have never seen this before," she said. "I must know its history." "Let us pass on now," said De Vane, observing her emotion; and entering the refreshment-room, he handed her 10     218          DE VANE. ani ice. Others joined them, and in the animated conversa- tion that followed, the impression of sadness made by a pic- ture so vividly recalling her mother seemed to pass off. Some time after, Mlle. Vesperini came to her, and said: "I am going to ask you to sing. Of course you will not refuse me." She colored to the temples. She was really distressed. "Can you not excuse me?" she said. "Not after your singing, surely not after that. Will you not excuse me?" "I really wish to hear you," said Mlle. Vesperini. "Do oblige me." "Of course," said Esther, " every one must know that in singing this evening I yield my wishes to yours." And putting her arm in that of Mille. Vesperini, with a graceful expression in her manner, of deference to so celebrated an artist, she accompanied her to the drawing-room. She took her seat at the harp, and her attitude was that of per- fect grace. Never had her beauty been more resplendent. There was nothing of embarrassment in her manner, but something of consciousness wag seen in her expression-a slight indication of her sense of the very severe task which she was about to undertake. Her dress was becoming to her; it was snowy white, and fell in rich folds about her person. She wore a necklace of pearls, and in her hair the crimson passion-flower was twisted with violets. After touching lightly the strings of the instrument, which seemed to breathe undo her snowy fingers, she sang: "I know that my Redeemer liveth." Her voice, gaining strength and increasing in power as she advanced, rose upon the air. It was as full of sublime and thrilling sympathy with the world's great hope of im- mortality, as if an angel, unseen by others, stood before lier   DE VANE.          219 in revealing light, and warmed her soul with the love that fills the hearts of seraphs; and as the dying cadences were lost in silence, every one felt that something celestial lin- gered near them. - Mle. Vesperini's eyes were swimming in tears. In her ardor, she rushed to Esther's chair, threw an arm about her, and said: "Oh! that you were with me in Rome." "Ah! Mle. Vesperini," said Mr. Clarendon, brushing his eyes, '" we could not give her up." De Vane's face was radiant. Turning to Waring, he said: "What a triumph!" "Ye' said Miss Godolphin  " she is glorious. Her song, too, is characteristic of herself. She could' have chosen nothing so appropriate." There were some present who had never heard Esther before, and the rapturous applause that greeted her, proved how well she was appreciated. She rose from her seat, conducted by Mle. Vesperini; and approached thetgroup where Waring and De Vane were standing. De Vane greeted her warmly, and said: "I will not at- tempt to thank you-I can not." "Nothing can be finer than that in the way of uttering thanks," said Mile. Vesperini, smiling. Waring gave Esther his hand silently. Miss Godolphin was exultant; she said: "I am not taken by surprise. I knew you before; but I am delighted that Mle. Vesperini has heard you." More music was called for. The love for it seemed to grow by that it fed on. Miss Dahlgreen urged Miss Go- dolphin to sing., "Oh! no," she said. "Mle. Vesperini has heard me. I am at home here, and can be heard at any time. Will you not favor us, Miss Dahlgreen?" "Not this evening, thank you," she replied. "I only     220          DE VANE. sinlo cheer my friends at home; and for some time past have bestowed too little attention on music." "Yo must not appeal to me," said Waring, as she looked tpward him. "I heard you last fall, and I was so channe l, that I threatened, you remember, to visit you every week, to hear you." "Yes, you are very good, Mr. Waring, I know; but I really sing very little." Miss Godolphin took her seat at the piano, and Mile. Vesperini and Esther undertook to accompany her in singing. It was done with great effect, each voice at times sus- taining a single part, and again blending in strong and deep harmony. Miss Godolphin's voice was one of great power, and in cultivation almost rivaled that of Mle. Vesperini. Rare- ly, in any circles, had such music been heard; and the lit- tle capital could boast at once of its beauty, its genius, its eloquence, its arts, and its statesmanship. The flying hours were swiftly passing. Looking out from the gallery which ran on the side of the drawing- room, and into which its windows opened, the stars were seen in their bright courses, and the moon flooded the gar- den with its radiance. Mle. Vesperini was prevailed on to sing once more-to sing one of those favorite melodies, which the genius of her countryman, Moore, had produced. She sat at the harp. Its tones were sadder than ever: they seemed to steal from a broken heart; and the voice of the cantatrice, in tenderest sympathy with them, floated upon the air. She sang those tender lines, written in the highest con- ception of love desolate, and mourning the young heroic dead- "She is far from the land where her young hero sleeps ;"   DE VANE.          221 I and the gush of emotion which she could not restrain, was as thrilling as if she herself were the young maiden whose heart had been crushed by the blow which destroyed her lover, lamenting at once his fate and her own. De Vane was standing near Miss Godolphin, and he had observed that from the moment the artist's fingers had struck from the chords of the harp the air which had just died in their trembling tones, she grew pale, as the song was uttered in such passionate eloquence. She seemed scarcely conscious; and when it ceased, she reeled and was falling, when he caught her and placed her in a chair. Scarcely any one had observed her emotion, for their eyes were fixed on Mlle. Vesperini, and De Vane, with perfect self-possession and delicacy,.shielded her. from those about him. Her head rested for a moment on his arm, pale as if death had robbed those classical features forever of their glowing beauty. Then, with a deep sigh, she woke to consciousness, and the warm blood, returning, suffused her very brow. She looked up to De Vane's face, and murmured: "Thank you,"  "Let me bring you an ice," he said. "No," she replied, "' Iwill go with you; and passing her arm through that of De Vane, they went into the re- freshment-room, almost unobserved. Not wholly so, for TWaring had witnessed the scene; but with full sympathy with De Vane, he had placed himself so as to protect them from the view of others. After a little time, De Vane returned to the drawing- room, and said to Esther that Miss Godolphin wished her to excuse her absence to Mle. Vesperini, and say to her that she would join her very soon. Esther approached Mile. Vesperini, and delivered the message. Miss Dahlgreen came forward, and expressed     222         DE VANE. her thanks to Mlle. Vesperini for the pleasure which she had afforded them all. "Ah!" she replied, " you do not know how I have en- joyed the evening. This place is charming. I know nothing like it in this country. I shall carry away with me such impressions, and cherish such recollections! It is charming." "We are much pleased to hear you say so," said Miss Dahlgreen. "One who has seen so much that is attract- ive in the world, in pronouncing so warmly her approval of us, must know how we prize the tribute." Miss Godolphin entered the room, and engaged in con- versation with them, "A thousand thanks to you, Miss Godolphin," said Mile. Vesperini, "for this charming evening. I wish that I could linger with you, but the wheels will to-morrow bear me away." "Not to-morrow," said Mrs. Habersham. "We did hope to have you with us longer." "To-morrow evening, madamn, I shall be compelled to fly. Ireland calls me-I must see my home." Then followed the leave-taking. The guests departed; but long lingered in their memory the sounds that had floated over their souls, and the words of song which had awakened within them a new and strong sympathy with the divine art. "Let us walk, Miss Wordsworth," said De Vane; " the night is fine." "I fear, Esther," said Mrs. Springfield, " that you will take cold. It may be better that Mr. De Vane and your- self should join us in the carriage." Esther decided to walk, and De Vane wrapping her in her ample shawl, they enjoyed the fresh air of the balmy night.   CHAPTER XX. 4  D . . i . s"PEAC, hath her victories No less renowned than war. New foes arise, Threatening to bind our souls with secular chains." JOHN MLTON. A VERY large number of persons called the next day, and left their cards for Mle. Vesperini. She was out driving, attracted by the verdure, which gave an aspect of rural beauty to the town and its environs.  Every one was disposed to acknowledge the claim of the celebrated cantatrice to their consideration; a claim which her genius, her purity of character, and her fine manners, made it any thing but a task to meet by such attentions as her brief stay afforded them the opportunity to tender. The town, distinguished for its refinement, was attractive to stran- gers, and European travelers embraced it in their tour, and spoke of it everywhere in terms which were not more glowing than they were just. The College shed about it an intellectual influence which was very marked, while the highest courts in the State being held there, and the annual assembling of the Legislature, made it a place of far greater interest and importance than its numerical population or its commercial activity would have con- ferred on it, if it had been left dependent on these alone. 3yong may its College prosper! Long may it be the seat of a government distinguished for intelligence, statesman- ship, and dignity! De Vane's visits to Mr. Springfield's became more fre- (22a)     224         DE VANE. quent, and he could no'longer conceal from himself'his growing interest in Esther. They were much together. Books, music, art-all interested them. Not a word of love was spoken, not a hint of the slightest change in their relations. They walked side by side, and knew and trusted each other more fully every day. The rich, vigor- ous mind of De Vane stimulated Esther in her studies, and she habitually consulted him in reference to her course of reading. By a reflex influence, too, she guided his tastes, and brought to his view such works as she felt satisfied would conduct him to that central stand-point in all learning which would enable him to see knowledge in its highest relations-relations which, seeming to be bounded by the horizon of the visible world, really stretched out illimitably and embraced the universe. She was far too wise to obtrude her views upon him, and even when he sought a conversation with her upon the great questions of morals, she suggested rather than argued. His pride of character she well knew. She had said to him that he was very proud, and she scrupulously forbore to put him in the attitude of defending opinions which' he sometimes expressed, by combating them-opinions very odious to her, too. But she would content herself with calling his attention to certain other views which ought fairly to be examined in connection with them. She was very wise, and her influence over him was far greater than he ever supposed it to be. As an angel, invisible to our mortal eyes, may walk by our side and guide our steps, so she, quite unconsciously to him, walked with him, and often influenced him where he might have erred. The no- bleness of his nature was such that he loved the true, the good; though, as he had ever remarked of himself, he loved the beautiful intensely, and his tastes being offend- ed would sometimes make him turn away from what was both good and true. There was a grandeur in his charac-   DE VANE.         225 ter which elevated him very far above commonplace men, and his integrity was thorough. What his future was to be could not be decided: he was but upon the threshold of life. Who can read the horoscope of a young man of in- tellect, ardor, and ambition? The political contest through which the country was passing was deepening in interest, and it roused the ener- gies of the State. Mr. Clarendon felt the deepest interest in the election of General Jackson, and he exerted all the power of his magnificent mind to bring it about. Mr. Adams was conducting the administration upon principles which he could not approve, and Mr. Clay was developing his system for the protection of American industry with great boldness. Much as Mr. Clarendon admired the per- sonal qualities of those disting ished statesmen-the one a scholar, the other almost peerless as an orator-he could not give his sanction to a system false in itself as a meas- ure of national policy, and as hurtful to the South as it was unfair to every other interest in the country but the manufactures which it sought to protect, while it was a flagrant violation of the Constitution. General Jackson, too, was heroic in his character, re- markable for self-reliance, and eminently fitted -to lead the way to a complete popular victory. He was of the people; they loved him, believed in him, and would follow him without hesitation, either in the red path of battle, or 'i the political contest, hardly less fierce, in which he was now engaged. His previous defeat was not the result o: the want of popular confidence; but several eminent mer being candidates for the Presidency, the vote of the elect oral colleges was Lo divided that no one of the aspirants ob tained a majority. General Jackson led the way in thE splendid course which opened to the coveted place; but 'by a provision of the Constitution, the election devolves upon the House of Representatives in the event of a failure 10*     226         DE VANE.  of the electoral colleges to give to some one person a ma- jority of the whole vote. General Jackson, of Tennessee, John Quincy Adams, of Massachusetts, and William H. Crawford, of Georgia, were the three who stood highest in the list of candidates by the popular vote. Mr. Clay, of Kentucky, fell short of the requisite number, and could not go before the House of Representatives; but, being the leading member of that body, his influence over it was controlling. It is well known that, if Mr. Crawford's health had not suddenly failed, he would have been the choice of the House; but a shadow passed over his grand intellect, and unfitted him for the labors of that eminent position. As an eagle, rising upon strong wing from his mountain eyrie toward some loftier and sublimer peak, from which he might with undazzled eye look out upon the boundless plain, sinks suddenly with drooping wing, and seeks the humbler resting-place from which he had soared, so this really great man sank in the very moment of anticipated triumph, when he had almost reached the highest flight of his ambition; and returning to the State which still loved and honored him, passed the remainder of his life in the discharge of humbler duties. Mr. Adams was the choice of the House-a result due to Mr. day's influence. Now, the recurrence of another election brought with it still intense strife. The friends of Mr. Adams and of Mr. Clay employed all their'means to secure the reflection of the President, that he might, in accordance with the usage, then unbroken, of a service of eight years, except in the single instance of his own father, fill the measure of his ambition and Is fame; while the supporters of General Jackson, roused and fired, put out all their energies in his behalf. By midsummer the contest had become a very animated one. Mr. Clarendon entered into it with ardor; he insisted that the contest involved principles of the   DE VANE.          227 largest interest and importance; that it was a struggle not for men,'but for the ascendency of the friends of the Con- stitution over its enemies;. that the structure of the Go- vermnent was such as to make it essential to adhere to the Doctrines advanced by the friends of the rights of the States, and not to surrender it to the control of those tatesmen who sought to convert it into a grand imperial consolidated system, which would merge the rights of the States in the power and glory of the empire. Into these views De Vane fully entered. He wrote and spoke for them with power, and attracted attention by the vigor and earnestness with which he advocated truths that he believed to be essential to the prosperity and glory of the country. d There was an elevation and dignity about his manner, his tone, his style of thought, that separated him widely from commonplace politicians; and he was already, in character, in breadth of view, and in his whole bearing, entitled to the name of statesman. He was about to visit Virginia. His father had ex- pressed a decided wish that he should do so. Still he lin- gered-he scarcely knew why; but he found it not at all easy to complete his arrangements for his journey. He was much at Mr. Springfield's; and he had explained to Mrs. Springfield and to Esther his plans. He was th visit his home, pass the summer, or what was left of it, in the mountains, and return in October to pursue his studies. Waring, too, had been consulted. He approved his views, and urged him to adhere to his resolution as to his future residence. It was Waring'splan for the summer vacation, to remain at home, and fit himself, by diligent study, to enter upon his duties at the opening of the ensMng session of the College; and he was already quite advanced in his preparation for a course of lectures, upon the subjects em- braced in his department. Esther had relaxed somewhat her course of training for o      228         DE VANE. the little girls, thinking that, in the heat of the summer months, it might be better for them to be employed with the needle, and with drawing and painting, than to be confined to books. The arrangement, too, afforded her the relaxation which she wished; and as Mrs. Green was very competent to instruct her little charge in needle- work, one of the more advanced pupils was to undertake the task of looking after their progress in the arts, as Es- ther playfully styled them. She made them a daily morn- ing call, joined in their devotions, and looked into their little wants. The garden which supplied the table with vegetables was well looked after by '"Uncle Jacob," as they all called the old servant. He prided himself upon having the earliest, the best, and the latest fruits and vegetables in the town. One evening, when the sun was just sinking behind the western hills, De Vane sat at the melodeon in Waring's room, touching its keys with an air of abstraction. War- ing had walked out. He was alone, and the thought of his journey, now soon to be undertaken, depressed him. What changes had come over him, since he last saw his home; when very young, full of ardor, and impressed with the stateliness of the aristocratic life which had surrounded him! Now how little there was in all that to attract him,! He did not undervalue rank, nor wealth, nor power; but be had learned to estimate them at what they were worth. Hie had learnedto distinguish the real from the ideal; to prize truth, and goodness, and refinement, wherever he found them. His tastes were purer, simpler than before; and, while his ambition was none the less, it had addressed itself to tLoe attainment of grander objects, by nobler means. He saw now, that the aim of aristocratic appoint- ments, which made the social distinctions of life so broad, was to perpetuate high qualities, by preserving one class firon) deterioration, providing for it the means of culture,   DE VANE.         229 which should insure a proper training, and make the mind, the heart, the tastes, the manners, what they should be. But he saw how all this had failed; how the aristocratic class was becoming enfeebled; and how the humbler class was advancing in intellectual power and moral excellence. He saw how much there was of beauty, of refinement of mind, of goodness, in those whom the aristocratic professed to despise. The young patrician's brow darkened as these thoughts came over him. Was Waring his friend? One of the noblest men the world ever saw; full of intellect, of strength, of generous sympathy, of manly virtue, of re- finement, of sensibility, of a heroic love of truth-was such a man to be despised because he lacked wealth; be- cause he had taught, to enable his sister to enjoy the little estate left to them, not large enough for bothlbut suffi- cient for her; because he belonged to a religious sect de- spised by many; and because he stepped forward into the work of the ministry among this people, under the prompt- ingsof a great heart, and an imperious sense of duty-was such a man to be looked down upon as a plebeian? Was Mr. Springfield to be despised-a man of the highest order, whose mind, heart, education, tastes, man- ners, elevated him above tens of thousands of those who talked of race, and family, and caste? Esther, a peerless woman, glorious in person, in intellect, in soul; a ministering angel on earth, turning away from the frivolous and little objects which so many of her age prized; bestowing her abounding means in the rearing, and support, and culture of the helpless; full of all gener- ous qualities; accomplished to a degree which threw the attainments of the tribe of elegant high-born triflers into the shade; with a soul full of truth-was she to be looked down upon because she' was the daughter of a Methodist preacher, as he had heard him styled? -Because she was herself a Methodist, was she to be despised? or if not     230         DE VANE. despised, treated with a condescending patronage more insulting still?                     1 The young patrician's lips were very firmly compressed, his eyes grew larger, and in their dark depths the blaze of irrepressible indignation flamed.             s He struck the keys of the instrument, and there rolled  t from it a lofty strain, which seemed to seek the heavens, t grand, solemn, awe-inspiring; then it swelled into an an- Z them, which filled the room with its volume.        1 Waring had returned, and was standing in the door of   ] the room, his arms crossed upon his breast. He would not disturb De Vane. He stood and observed him. He saw that he was roused. And as the music from the fine instrument rolled away, his face expressed the admiration and intent with which he regarded the young patrician. The music ceased. De Vane closed the instrument, and rose from his seat. His face was calmer, but a high sen- timent was expressed in his features. Waring had not moved, and De Vane, turning toward the door, for the first time became aware of his presence. "O Waring! you have returned. Where on earth have you been wandering?"  "Not quite beyond this dusty world, but still in a pleas- ant part of it. I have been in the public garden." "Indeed! And did you meet any agreeable people?" "Several," said Waring. "Now, you intenb said De Vane, "that I shall ask after them particularly. Why not be a generous fellow at once? You need not stand upon your dignity. It's vacation now." Waring smiled, and said: "The garden was unusually thronged, and I met a number of persons-some of them very agreeable."' "Was Miss Godolphin there?"   Eri  VANE.        231 "She was," said Warin, " and asked after you particu- larly."  "I hope you gave a good account of me." "Yes," said Waring, "I told her that you were still studying faithfully-law in the morning, andother mat- ters in the evening, perhaps not so profitable; but that I thought you were becomipg a little more humanized, for you were somewhat more inclined than formerly to visit the ladies. At which report of you she seemed quite pleased." " I'm very much obliged to you both," said De Vane. "Yes, and perhaps you will be still more pleased to learn that Miss Wordsworth was with her." "Indeed !" said De Vane, looking slightly conscious. "Oh ! yes," said Waring, " and I am instructed to in- form you that Miss Godolphin takes Miss Wordsworth with her to tea, and that you are expected to join them without any unnecessary delay." "You are a gracious messenger," said De Vane.; '~ and may I inquire if you are to honor the ladies with your presence ?" "I am to have the honor of accompanying you," he replied; " so let us walk." -As they descended the stairs, they saw Mrs., Bowen, and explained to her that they would not remain for tea, and she said: "Well, I'm glad to see you go out; not that I don't like to have you here, but I know that you will enjoy yourselves much better." "Thank you, Mrs. Bowen," said De Vane. "I enjoy your house very much, but I must take Professor Waring out sometimes, to see the ladies."o "Ah! yes, I understand it," she said; "it's all right." They bade her good evening, and walked away. A few minutes' walk brought them to Mrs. Habersham's; and     282          DE VANE. they were shown into a small drawing-room, where they found the ladies. "You observe, ladies," said Waring, ' that I have car. ried out my instructions." "Faithfully," said Miss Godolphin, " for which we are obliged. Not finding you in the walk which you some. times take, Mr. De Vane," she continued, " we asked Mr. Waring to be so good as to invite you to join this even- ing in a cup of tea, quietly, and we are very glad to see you." "I am most happy to come," said De Vane, bowing. "My friend here deserted me this evening in some way, and left me to the solitude of my room. If I had known that he was going in search of you, I should have joined him." "I am sure he had no such purpose,7" said Miss Godol. phin; " but taking a turn through the walks of the public garden, after a visit to Leasowes, with Miss Wordsworth, we had the good fortune to meet Mr. Waring." "Of course,"? said De Vane. "Fortunate man! I must hereafter keep close by his side." Esther was much amused, and Miss Godolphin ex- claimed: "A willful man will have his way." A rich silver tea-service was brought in by a footman, and small tables were placed by the chair of each guest; he then, after placing on the table a silver waiter, filled with light gateaux and confitures, withdrew. I Mrs. Hab- ersham took her seat near the tea-service, and made the tea, the gentlemen passing it to the ladies, and taking their own cups. . Servants were excluded from the room, both at breakfast and tea, at Mrs. Habersham's; the European style being adopted, which leaves the family free to in- dulge in conversation without restraint. After tea, Mrs. Habersham withdrew, and the conversa- tion was of books, especially of some which had lately   DE VANE.          233 appeared. Sir Walter Scott was giving to the press at that time those entertaining books which have been so widely diffused throughout the world, and which have contributed so much to cheer the hours of many, who, without them, would have been listless, or would have turned to amusements less innocent than reading pages which are full of refinement, of taste, and of culture. He has almost dramatized history; and often, with a slen- der thread of fiction, has guided the mind through an ex- tended view of real events and actual objects. His poet- ical and his prose works were both discussed. "His poetry is very pleasing," said Miss Godolphin, "but it possesses no depth of sentiment, no passion. It charms by its descriptions and its narrations." De Vane said: "He abandoned the field of poetry to explore another, which he has shown to be very attractive. His historical novels are charming. They possess a dra- matic interest, which is so attractive to all classes." "The great charm of Scott," said Miss Godolphin, " is ais genial nature, his kindliness. One feels safe under his guidance; and no matter where he may lead you, he will, you are sure, protect you, and bring you back from lake, or mountain height, or tournament, or battle, safely. He is your friend all the way that you journey in his com- pany."                         F Esther spoke of the Bride of Lammermoor as evincing more of depth of sentiment than any of his tales which she had read, and said : "It depresses me sadly to read it. There is scarcely any thing of the kind which affects me so much." "It is not to be wondered at,"' said De Vane. "It is intensely sad. Every incident in the progress of the story throws its sombre shadow over the future. The scene at the fountaints full of this--the fluttering raven falling at , the feet of Ravenswood and Miss Ashton, pierced with an     234         DE VANE. arrow, the blood staining her white dress. I do not won- der that the book depresses you. Never read it." " The declining fortunes," said Miss Godolphin, " of Ra- venswood, his pride, his dignity, his nobleness, are to me very affecting. It is dreadful to witness the struggle be- tween a noble, generous, proud spirit, and the adverse for- tunes which he encounters in striving to uphold the claims of his house. Such a social spectacle is at any time heart- rending." " No man," said Waring, " should carry on such a struggle. It can only occur where society is organized upon a basis too artificial to be stable. ;Every man should be willing to work for his living, when it becomes neces- sary to do so. He is the happier for it, and far more re- spectable." "Yes," said Miss Godolphin, " in this country that is quite true; but in a country where no labor is reputable but military service, it is not so. Indeed, even in this country, there is sometimes a painful yielding to declining fortunes in families accustomed to wealth." " But,"' said Waring, " it ought not to be so anywhere. Labor ought always to be reputable. Self-reliance, inde- pendence--these are heroic qualities, and these ought to be encouraged. I have seen young men, whose fathers were loaded with debt, and were struggling to bear up under its burdens, too, I will not say proud--I will not degrade the term by such an application of it-too mean to work, and actually seeking to obtain credit upon the account of these very fathers, when it required some ad- dress to do it. That spectacle humiliates me." He spoke with energy, and De Vane looked at him with admiration. "I quite agree with you, Mr. Waring," said Miss Godol- phin, " in that view.  You can not state it too strongly for me. But when the blow first falls-when the extent of   I   DE VANE.     T             235 the calamity is not known-when the hope of better times has not yet died out, and when the persons are hardly fitted for the rough service of life, ah ! then the blasts of adversity are keenly felt." "There are doubtless such cases,"' said Waring. " But I am very impatient at the attempt that I see sometimes made, in this country, to put labor under the ban. I honor , it, and if there be any one to whom I would bow reverently and take off my hat, it is to a mechanic, with bent form and stiffenedlI frame, who is making his way with feeble steps toward a home which he has worn out his life in try- ing to make a happy one." Miss Godolphin's eyes filled with tears. c( Ah! Mr. War- ing," she said, "I honor the sentiment, as much as you do the bent laborer. You are not more sturdily American than I am." "I have never doubted that," said he. " You are too earnest to sympathize with a heartless social system, that wishes to degrade industry, and stamp self-reliance as ple- beian. But," he continued, after a moment's pause, "while I have known such cases, Miss Godolphin, as those to which you refer, where the sudden reverses of life have brought great wretchedness, I have witnessed other in- stances which were more deplorable still; instances where daughters, thoroughly educated, and competent to teach, had disdained thU slightest exertion when misfortunes came that brought distress, and painful,-exhausting toil upon the father who had supplied them with every luxury in their better days. How much better, how much happier, how much more respectable they would have been, if with their hands they had ministered to the wants of the family, and solaced the anxieties that bowed the form of one whose cup was made still more bitter by 'the thought that he could no longer meet the wishes and gratify the tastes of      236          DE VANE. those who hung about him! I love and honor independ. ence unspeakably." "Miss Godolphin's criticism," said De Vane, " or rather her appreciative remark as to the unhappy condition of Ravenswood, is a perfectly just one. His position, and the country and the times in which he lived, made it impos. sible that he could do any thing to better his fortunes, ex- cept as a soldier ; and sad as it was to see the quicksapds of Kelpie's Flow close over him and his horse, as he rode' to meet Douglas Ashton, I experienced a sense of relief too. I could not bear to see him struggling in the midst of life- long humiliations. Better death than that. His own mourn- ful words spake the nobleness of his nature, when he said to the faithful Caleb: ' You have no longer a master. Why, old man, would you cling to a falling tower?' " Esther had said nothing for some time. o She was deeply interested in the discussion which had been going on, and as De Vane made his last remark, she fixed her eyes upon him with unconscious earnestness. She sympathized pro- foundly with him, and she comprehended how a grand nature like his might, under some circumstances, grow weary of life, if there were not something jto cheer the spirit beyond the visible objects of time. "Do you then, Mr. De Vane," she said, " not agree with IIamlet, that we should 'rather bear those ills we have, Than fly to others that we know not of'?" "Ah! he spoke of taking one's own life," said De Vane. "That, I think, is never to be done, certainly never to be looked to, as an escape firom the weariness of life. But tI spoke of perishing by some casualty." "Even then," she said, " sudden death is terrible; for it precipitates us into   DE VANE.          237 ' The undiscovered country, from whose bourn No traveler returns.") De Vane looked grave. Waring said nothing, but smiled.. "Death, under any circumstances," said M4ss Godolphin, is appalling."       "Far from it," said Waring. I have seen it under cir- umstances which made it luminous and triumphant." "So have 1-once," said De Vane. A silence-stillness-reigned for some moments.' At length Miss Godolphin said: "That Bride of Lam- nermoor has saddened us all. Poor Lucy Ashton! Let Ls turn to something gayer." She rose, and rang for a servant. "Bring us some ices," he said. He presently returned with refreshments, and left the voom again. "How delicious ices are!" said:Esther; "water-ices Especially!" "Yes," said Miss Godolphin. "I find them refreshing n mid-winter." After some general conversation, Esther said: "Miss Godolphin, when I was last here, Mr. De Vane called my attention to a picture in the drawing-room where we were that evening, which greatly interested me. Will you give me its history?" Miss Godolphin looked at De Vane quickly. \ "I said nothing to Miss Wordsworth of its history," he said. "I pointed it out to her, but we left the room soon after, and I made no explanations." "Then you know its history?" said Esther, turning to him with surprise. "Only what I have told him," said Miss Godolphin, "arid you shall soon learn that. It so happened that when we were i Naples the last winter we passed in Europe,     238          DE VANE. we visited the studio of an eminent artist from our own country, and we saw the picture there. My aunt purchased several of his paintings-some of them very costly-and I two or three. Struck with the beauty and exquisite finish of the large picture to which you refer-that which repre- sents Salome, the daughter of Herodias, bearing the head of John the Baptist to her mother-I offered to purchase it. The artist refused to sell it, and said he valued it highly, not only as one of his very best pictures, but be. cause it was associated with recollections that endeared it to him. He made no further explanation, and, of course, I could ask for none. Some days after I called again, and was standing before the picture which so powerfully at- tracted me, when the artist came to me, and said that I seemed really to value the painting which I was examin- ing; that he had painted it in Rome, during the last sea- son; that it was endeared to him by associations of the strongest kind; that nothing could induce him to sell it, but that he had the means of reproducing it, if he should desire to do so at some future time; and that as I appre- ciated it, he would present it to me-if I would accept it, adding that it would be seen in that part of his native country where he most desired to be favorably known. I, of course, thanked him warmly, and did not refuse it. He said he would have it forwarded to my address. A few weeks since, it arrived, and when it was hung, I then saw the wonderful resemblance which Salome bore to yourself. This is the history of the picture. Let us go and see it." Rising from her seat, she rang for a servant, and ordered the green drawing-room to be lighted. "It is very strange," said Esther. "It must, of course, be an accidental resemblance." "I should suppose so," said Miss Godolphin, " if the re- semblance were less striking, and limited to the features; but the fidelity of the picture to features, form, hair, ex-   DE VANE.         239 pression, is so remarkable, that I confess I think a mystery surrounds it which we do not yet comprehend." Speaking with great earnestness, she rose and conducted the party into the drawing-room with green silk hangings and furniture. It was octagonal in form, and on one of the panels, suspended by a rich, heavy cord of green silk, with tassels touching the elaborate frame, was the picture. The room was well lighted; and as the party entered it, the figure of the Jewish maiden, with her flowing white robes and crimson shawl, her face turned upon the specta- tors, seemed to breathe with life and emotion, and the re- semblance to Esther was so perfect as to be 'absolutely startling. She herself stood in mute astonishment, and as she fixed her lustrous eyes upon the picture, they swam in tears, and her lips parting, unconsciously she said, scarcely loud enough to be heard even by De Vane, upon whose art she rested: "Oh! how like my mother!" Her emotion was observed, and loo much respect was felt for it, to disturb her fixed gaze upon the picture. After some moments she said: "I have in my possession, Miss Godolphin, a portrait which you have never seen. It is of my mother, and hangs in my own chamber. It was painted for her when she was of my age, and the name of the artist is unknown to me, but the picture is of the highest style of art." "It is strange," said Miss Godolphin. "I confess my- self wholly unable to explain it." "The picture is a glorious one," said De Vane. I never saw one so fine." "It is one of extraordinary beauty," said Waring, " and I now see that the resemblance to Miss Wordsworth is even more faithful than I had supposed it to be, when I first saw it." -Miss Godolphin conducted them to the other paintings     240          DE VANE. which adorned the walls; and as they reached her own portrait, they stood to examine it. "It is superb," said De Vane. "It impressed me the first time I saw it. Not only is the likeness remarkable, but the whole painting is wonderfully fine." "How little good taste is usually shown in portraits!" said Waring. "The awkwardness, stiffness, and conceit make them unbearable; but this is free from faults." "The criticism," said Miss Godolphin, "is a very just one. A difficulty sometimes occurs as to costume. The changing styles, not only of different ages, but those which occur in the course of a very few years, give to portraits, in some instances, a quaint and even a ludicrous appear- ance.'"             X "There should," said De Vane,. "be as little of modern costume introduced in a picture as possible. The drapery should be loose and flowing. The nearest approximation to the classical style is the best; best in every way, for it is quite certain that the standard of perfection in the arts was attained under the skies of Greece." "Your remark," said Esther, " is especially true of statu- ary. The drapery should be flowing. The toga was the most becoming garment ever worn by your sex." "Perfectly true," said De Vane, " and I should be pleased to go back to it. How shocking it is to see buttons, for instance, either in bronze or marble, on the skirts of ladies, more or less ample!" "I am not at all sure that I agree with you," said War- ing. "I do not think it appropriate to see modern heroes and statesmen represented in ancient costume, and espe- cially half-nude. "I am astonished at you," said De Vane. "The nearer nude you produce the statue, the more closely do you ap- proach the well-established principles of art. Art has principles as well defined, and laws as binding, as any of   DE VANE.  -       241 the sciences; and you can not depart from them without (f detriment to the subject." "I should subordinate every thing," said Waring, " to higher laws than those of taste; and I am not at all sure that by exhibiting the half-nude form of a hero-certainly of a statesman, and to go higher still, of an apostle--you do not impair the impression of dignity which it is the wish of the artist to create." "Rank heresy!" said De Vane. "Bless my soul! War- ing, you must positively review your impressions of art. Look at all the representations of the human form in sculp- ture or painting-from the time of Phidias and Apollo Vill now-and you will find them more or' less nude. If you exclude the ancients as heathens--as I suspect you are inclined to do-then take the artists from the time when the Christian. era dawned, and when every thing began to adjust itself to the new order of thought and emotion, and you will find my view confirmed. Take the sculpture, the paintings of those days, the pictures of the apostles, of saints of both sexes, and sep if you will not find a universal concurrence in the principles of taste, especially in the grand principle, that the human form must be presented X with as little drapery as is consistent with cultivated taste." . "There is one exception to the principle which you lay down, Mr. De Vane," said Miss Godolphin. "The blessed Virgin is everywhere in full drapery. I do not know that I can recall another instance in which your law is not well settled in its application to the works of the great mas- ters, both in sculpture and painting." "And the exception which you state," said Waring, "is so fully sustained by the sentiment of the world, that it proves it to be well founded. It rests upon a principle of our nature, and it is only education which can accus- tom the eve to any great departure from it." "     242         DE VANE. "Suppose Hercules, throttling the Nemean lion," said De Vane, " or Laocoon and his sons in the folds of the ser- pent, were represented in drapery, would not the impres- sion be destroyed? Or the dying gladiator--would it ,iot impair the effect? I admit that in painting, the ad- justment of drapery is more tractable, and therefore to be more modified, to suit even an uncultivated .taste. But at all events, let"us not insist on coats and vests for gentle- nren, or a very literal copying even of the dresses of our ladies, either in sculpture or painting." - They all laughed, and were passing to another picture, when a servant entered, and approaching Miss Godolphin, informed her that Miss Wordsworth's carriage had arriv- ed. All exclaimed against such an early departure; but upon looking at the clock, it was discovered that the hour was really a late one, It was agreed that on the evening after the next, which would be Thursday, they should meet again at Mrs. Springfield's. Waring and De Vane both drove with Esther to her door, and then took leave of her, declining to be taken home in the carriage.   CHAPTER XXI. AND would we aught behold of higher worth Than that inanimate cold world allowed To the poor, loveless, ever-anxious crowd-- Ah! from the soul itself must issue forth A light, a glory, a fair luminous cloud Enveloping the earth." SAMUEL TAYOR COLERIDGE. THE arrangements for De Vane's departure were nearly ,ompleted. He must go, reluctant as he was to quit the enchanted circle in which he moved, giving and receiving pleasure. His sense of duty imperiously exerted its con- trol over him. Such was his organization, that sti'ong as his passions were, they were under the dominion of his principles. The tide might swell with apparently resist- less power, and the waves lash the resounding shore, but they \yere stayed by a law of his nature that they could not overcome. The sensibility which characterized him, made him seem, to a casual observer, too warm for steady resistance to his inclinations; but those who knew him comprehended how firmly he could plant himself when lihe made up his mind that it was his duty to hold his posi- tion. He was easily influenced by his tastes, and attract- ed or repelled by what pleased or offended his sense of the beautiful; but when an appeal was made to his sense of right, the decision was made in obedience to that. ITe must return home, and he decided to leave the following MAonday. The invitation for Thursday evening cheered him. He would once more enjoy a visit to a family to (243)     2:14         DE VANE. which he had become strongly attached; for, independent of his very deep interest in Esther, his respect and regard for Mr. and Mrs. Springfield were strong. He retained his room at Mrs. Bowen's, assuring her that he should re- enter it in October, and giving directions that his books and furniture should be looked after during his absence. His room was his home-he loved it-and he could not think of tearing himself away from a place so dear to him as the town where he had passed the happiest years of his life, without holding his claim upon one spot-that he might think of, in his absence, as his own. Hlow the soul clings to inanimate objects, and invests them with its own light! When Thursday evening came, De Vane and Waring took their walk, turning their steps toward the College. They walked throurgh the deserted campus, and. felt the sadness of its loneliness. They lingered but a little while, and then returned, going directly to Mr. Springfield's. Miss Godolphin was already there. The house was a delightful one, full of objects of grace and beauty-books, engravings, statuettes, instruments of music. The latest reviews were laid upon the table. The snowy muslin cur- tains, through which the summer air came freshly, gave an appearance of lightness and purity which was exhila- rating, and the chintz-covered furniture was tasteful and elegant. There is a wonderful charm about some homes. The moment you enter them, you feel refreshed; while others, with heavy magnificence, are sombre an^uninviting. MBrs. Springfield received them.   , "We are happy to see you," she said; " but you should have come earlier. The dvenings are short."  ' I said so to Mr. De Vane," said Waring, " but he lin- gered abdut the College campus, looking once more at the   DE VANE.          245 scenes of his former triumphs, a little longer than we in- tended to do." "Ah! Mr. De Vane," said Miss Godolphin, " you will leave us? I shall not flatter you by saying how much we shall regret you." "If any thing," said De Vane, " could cheer me in leav- ing this place, it would be the thought that my absence would be felt by any one." "That is a very modest speech, Mr. De Vane," said Miss Godolphin. "You must know, of course, how much we shall lose in giving you up, especially at this season." De Vane bowed, and said: "My absence will be but for some three month's-scarcely that, indeed; and I shall hasten my return, in the hope of enjoying society which has been so agreeable to me. My friend, Mr. Waring, is to keep me informed, too, of movements here."  "Very well," said Miss Godolphin; " we shall get our accounts of you through him, and quite regularly, I hope." "You are very good," said De Vane; " and I shall promise myself the happiness of hearing, in the same way, often from those of whom I shall think so constantly when absent." "Yes," said Waring, "I undertake to write .faithfully whatever is said to me here, and to report your messages." "So that is arranged," said Mrs. Springfield. "I am very glad that it is so. In the mean while, we shall exert ourselves to make the weeks pass as agreeably as possible." "For my part," said Waring, '; i take no pleasure in sum- mer travel. To -me it is much more agreeable to be at home. This business of seeking pleasure is very irksome." "How perfectly Hagree with you!" said Esther. "Above all things, to rush into crowded hotels, or to stay at thronged watering-places, is to me the most wearisome way of life that I have ever yet seen." "Nothing short of dreadful," said Miss Godolphin.     246          DE VANE. "It is true," said Esther, "one meets very agreeable peo- pie at some of those places; but the manner of life is very, very distasteful to me." "Far better get a farm-house in the country, hid away in some mountain gorge, where you -hear the songs of birds, the lowing of cattle, the clear human voice breaking the stillness of the air; and see fruits, and flowers, and the sweet face of nature; and get pure milk and fresh eggs," said Miss Godolphin, laughing. "Your picture is a delightful one," said Waring. "Yes," said Esther, "and a true picture. We found it so last summer. To add to our comforts, too, we had good horses, and could ride upon the side of the mountain, or plunge into the clear, rushing stream-not too deep, but yet suggestive of danger-and dash along the roads wind- ing through sequestered vales, without the fear of being remarked about as too wild." 'Glorious!" said De Vane. "And you ride on horse- back, do you?" "Ride!" said Esther. "Why, of course I do. Is not that a part of the education of a Southern lady?" "And yet I have never seen you," said he. "How I have suffered the spring to glide by without making that discovery." "I do not ride in town-at least, very rarely," she replied. "And you ride, too, Miss Godolphin," said De Vane, "I am to presume, after what Miss Wordsworth has said?" "Certainly; and we intend to perfect ourselves in that way during your absence, as the town will be pretty much deserted." "Pardon me, ladies," said De Vane; "I really supposed that our mountain region only furnished rivals for Diana Vernon. I am greatly pleased to make this discovery;   DE VANE.         2-17 and when I return, I shall'hope to join you. October is a glorious month for equestrian exercise." "Very well," said Miss Godolphin. "We shall hold our- selves in readiness, and you must prepare for break-neck adventures, for we shall be fearless equestriennes by that time." "I hope, ladies," said Waring, "that you will, in the mean while, permit me sometimes to join you." "We shall be most happy," said Esther, "to have you with us." "You are making my leave-taking, ladies," said De Vane, " a harder task for me than it was before." "Very well," said Miss Godolphin ;'- "if gentlemen will go on their summer rambles, we must seek what compen- sation we may." She was very bright; and De Vane observed how much more cheerful she was when in the presence of those who were with her this evening, than when in larger and gayer circles. Mr. Springfield, who had been out riding, came in, and all rose to meet him. "I must ask you to pardon me," said he; "I rode some- what farther than I intended, and was detained a little while on the road." ' By nothing disagreeable to you, I hope?" said Mrs. Springfield. "I crossed the river," said he, "and upon my return, just before I reached the ferry, I met young Walden, so much intoxicated as to be unable to sit on his horse; and I rode back with him to his mother's." "Sad-sad!" exclaimed Waring. "I had hoped that he had reformed. I must look after him again." "It is the vice of our times," said Mr. Springfield, "and it must be aristed, or our young men will be destroyed." Mrs. Springfield invited them to tea, and she conducted     248          DE V*NE.              K them to the table. Mr. Springfield preferred the custom of sitting at the table, even at the evening meal. For his own part, he said, he enjoyed it more than any other; and it was often, at his house, the most prolonged sitting of the day. Boiled fowls, warm bread, cream, fruits, and flowers made it an attractive meal; and De-Vane sympa- thized so fully with Mr. Springfield's tastes, that he enjoyed supper nowhere so much as at his house. "This recalls," said Miss Godolphin, " so vividly our way of living when we passed the summer in Switz- erland. We took a cottage, and kept house regularly. Never did we live so delightfully. The cream, the butter, the fowls, the fruits, were delicious; and as the sun went down behind the Alps, throwing shadows over us long before night, we were accustomed to spread our table in the little gallery, about which the shrubbery grew, and take our evening meal. The lowing of herds and the soncg of the mountaineers broke the solemn stillness of the hour. Oh! how superior it was to life in Paris, or in Florence, or in Naples! Nature, in her grandeur, and in her simple beauty too, was about us, and there was noth- ing to remind us of the great, noisy, dusty, confused world." "I can imagine it must be charming," said Mr. Spring- field, " after your description. Such an episode in life I wish very much, at some time, to enjoy myself." "And you would not accept it as a permanent arrange- ment?" she asked. "Oh! no," he said. "What would, become of one's duties? If every one who could do it, chose some happy . retreat, where the sad voice of humanity could not disturb his repose, what would become of our fellows? our kin- dred? of feebler pilgrims than ourselves, fainting by the wayside, and, wanting a strong arm to lift them up and help them along thelrough paths of life?" Miss Gbdolphin looked at him earnestly, and Waring   DE VANE.         249 observed De Vane's face beam as Mr. Springfield said this, in that manly, direct way, which has nothing of cant in it, and which makes every one instantly sympathize with the sincerity of the speaker. '"But," he continued, "I should be very much pleased to take such recreation as that, and it enters into my plans for the future." "Are there many, sir, who feel as you do?" asked Miss Godolphin. "Many, I trust," said he, " and, it is to be hoped, much more intensely. How Howard transcends us all: travers- ing Europe--not to enter its palaces, or visit its picture- galleries, or linger in delightful retreats; but, in the lan- guage of Burke, to gauge the depths of human misery, to let light and hope into dungeons, where they had long been strangers!" / "His was a sublime life," said Waring. "I am disposed to think, however, that there are many engaged in humane and benevolent activities little known to us, many whose lives are good and useful, without being grand." "I do not doubt it," said Mr. Springfield. "It is in that way that the harmony of life is made up, and that in its completeness it grows into a resemblance of the wide- spread world of nature. Miss Godolphin, you must have ,some of these peaches. Let me select you one." "Thank you," said she. "They are very fine. This- country of ours abounds with luxuries." "It is a goodly land," he said, "and this town is grow- ing up into great beauty. Skirted, too, with its sand-Wills, we find summer retreats without going far from home." "I observe," said Waring, "that they ame building up rapidly. The environs promise to be attractive. It would not surprise me to see permanent residences built up on our sand-hills."5 "*      250         DE VANIi. "That is already done," said Mrs. Springfield. "Some of our friends intend to reside there permanently." "It is much better to do so," said Mr. Springfield, "than to migrate every summer. Home society should be culti. vated, and an extended travel resorted to for health and recreation." "I am quite of your opinion," said Miss Godolphin. Returning to the library, they found Mr. Clarendon there, and upon Mrs. Springfield's expressing her regret that she had not been informed of his coming, that he might have joined them at the table, he said: "My dear inadam, I would not allow myself to be announced. I did not even ring your bell, but entering, found the house thrown open, and walked in unasked." "You did just what you should have done," said Mr. Springfield, "but you stopped too soon. Will you not come now and take some fruit?" He declined, and resumed his seat. The ladies gathered about him, and an animated conversation commenced. He was a welcome visitor everywhere. His large mind and large heart were appreciated, and there was a blended stateliness and warmth in his manners singularly captivat- ing. His conversational powers, when he thought proper to indulge them, fell but little short of his oratory. De - Vane resembled him in both respects, and the sympathy " between them was strong. Esther was his special favor- ite, and he often called to sit an hour with her. 'I feel myself slighted," said Mr. Clarendon, addressing Esther and Miss Godolphin. "I am half inclined to think that you invited these two young gentlemen to meet you this evening, and overlooked me." He assumed the look of an injured man, and laid his hand on Esther's arm. "Of course we could never overlook you, Mr. Claren- don. It happened that we met at Mrs. Habersham's an evening or two since, and it was arranged, before we sepa-   DE VANE.         251 rated, that we should meet here this evening. We are very glad that you have done us the honor to join us." "Then," said he, "these young gentlemen have no rights here this evening that I may not enjoy?" "None whatever," said Miss Godolphin. Mr. Clarendon kissed the hand of each of them, and X said: "Then I offer my homage." "Waring," said he, "is it true that De Vane is to set upon his travels shortly?" "He insists that he is serious in that purpose," said Waring, "and I must say that his preparations begin to look very much as if it were so." "He has been trying to make that impression on me," said Mr. Clarendon, " for some weeks, b'ut I have never yet been able to bring myself quite up to the line of faith. It must require a greater share of heroism than we usually find in these degenerate times." All laughed heartily, and De Vane said: "You do not overestimate the task, Mr. Clarendon; but I can not turn away from it, and I have therefore of late addressed myself to it with what resolution I am able to command." "Telemachus quitting the island without being precipi- tated from it by his Mentor," said Mr. Clarendon. There was no replying to this, and De Vane could only bow his acquiescence. "While seated here," said Mr. Clarendon, "I took up the January number of the Edinburgh Review, Mr. Spring- field. Do you find it a good one?" "There is one article," he answered, " which I read with interest. It is a notice of The Songs of Scobland, by Allan Cunningham, and the writer proceeds to inquire into the utility of poetry." "As if it could be questioned, said De Vane. "In this time of practical truth," said Mr. Clarendon,     252         DE VANE. "every thing is questioned which is not convertible into gold and silver. Burke said long ago, the age of chivalry is gone. That of sophists, economists, and calculators has succeeded, and the glory of Europe is extinguished for- ever. How can you expect poetry to be esteemed as of any value?" "What a magnificent passage that is of Burke's!" said " De Vane. "The finest he ever uttered, I think." "Very eloquent," said Mr. Clarendon. "The picture of the young Queen of France, glittering above the horizon like the morning star,'is poetry; and that too of a high order," said De Vane. "Let us turn to it," said Mr. Springfield, taking down from a shelf a volume of Burke's works; and handing it to De Vane, he requested him to find the passage and read it. He did so, with great effect. "Glorious!" said Esther. "Splendidly beautiful!" exclaimed Miss Godolphin. "If Mr. De Vane will pardon me," said Mr. Springfield, "I will say that I never before so fully appreciated it." ' Does the reviewer," said Mr. Clarendon, addressing himself to Mr. Springfield, "vindicate the utility of poetry?" "Fully, it seems to me," he said. "I am particularly pleased that he introduces Lord Bacon as an advocate for it, who commends it as being subservient to the imagina- tion-as logic is to the understanding-and says its office is no other than to apply and commend the dictates of reason to the imagination, for the better moving the appe- tite and will. The reviewer remarks, being an ally of rea- son and logic therefore, according to Lord Bacon, it is not to be despised."     / "Good!" said Mr. Clarendon, "very good!" "The authority of Lord Bacon is further cited," said Mr. Springfield, " in this way: The end of poetry is to fill   DE VANE.          253 the imagination with observations and resemblances which may second reason, and not-oppress and betraysit, for these abuses of art come in but ex obliquo, for prevention, not for practice. The reviewer adds: 'All this being the case, it seems that all speculations for putting down poetry must necessarily be vain and useless. They are formed perhaps for man as he ought to be, but certainly not for man as he is. They are, in short, like that dream of Plato, which has been a dream, and nothing more, for two thou- sand years. That celebrated Greek denied admittance to a poet in his ideal republic, and his republic has remained ideal."  ' Excellently well put," said Mr. Clarendon; "and he might have added the testimony of Swift, recorded in verse: 'Not empire to the rising sun, By valor, conduct, fortune won; Not greatest wisdom in debates, Or framing laws for ruling states; Such heavenly influence require, As how to strike the muse's lyre."' "I was reatly interested, a few evenings since," said De Vane, "in taking up a periodical, to find an article on Milton, by Dr. Channing. It is admirable throughout. He says that those who are accustomed to think of poetry as light reading, may think of the writings of Milton as only contributions to public amusement, but that such, was not the thought of the great poet himself. Of all God's gifts of intellect, he esteemed poetical genius the most transcendent. He esteemed it in himself a kind of inspiration, and wrote his great works with the conscious dignity of a prophet. Dr. Channing himself adds that he agrees with Milton in his estimate of poetry. The great New-England -scholar unhesitatingly assigns to the poetical faculty the first rank in. his classification of the intellectual powers."     254      ,   DE VANE. "He has just written," said Waring, " a powerful paper on Napoleon, and one which will repay the time expended in reading it." "It is drawn out," said De Vane, " by Sir Walter Scott's life of the great captain." "I have not yet read Scott's book," said Mr. Clarendon, "but I must do so." "It is conceived in no generous or magnanimous spirit," said De Vane; "nor do I think it even just. He is thor- oughly imbued with the sentiment of those who made war upon Napoleon, until they overthrew him." "He should not have undertaken such a work," said Mr. Springfield. "But, ladies," said Mr. Clarendon, we must know your estimate of poetry. What do you say, Miss Godolphin? Is Lord Byron right?" "Of course," said she, "you would not expect me to venture to oppose such authority as that of the great phi- losopher." "You can not be excused," said Mr. Clarendon;" phi- losophers, heroes, statesmen, all yield to your sex." "I agree, then," she said, "that the utility of poetry is unquestionable; that it is charming, no one doubts." "And you, Miss Wordswo th, what say you? Are we in this age to yield ours eves to the dominion of the im- agination, or to retain our Sober senses?" "We may do both, I thin ,'sid Esther. "Poetry of the highest order, such as Milton's, is consistent with the noblest of our faculties, and is but a felicitous expression of the deductions of reason." "I pronounce that opinion an end of contr6versy," said Mr. Clarendon, " and I regret that I have no wreath to crown you with." Miss Godolphin was seated near De Vane, and breaking from a vase near her a light vine brilliant with wild flow-   DE VANE.         255 ers, she twisted it into a wreath and put. it into the hands of De Vane, who, rising, laid it gently on the head of Esther. It flung its crimson flowers about her curls, and seemed to have been designed as an ornament for the brow which it graced. M1r. Clarendon applauded, and Esther, blushing deeply said: "I accept the wreath as a tribute to poetry, of which I happened to speak with4ardor." "The wreath is yours fairly, and poetry is fortunate in its representative. A crown was never more worthily be- stowed," said De Vane in low tones, as he stood near her. She made no reply, but a conscious expression flitted over her features. "I have sometimes been at a loss to determine," said Waring, "whether poetry surpasses the arts in the power of expression." "It is a beautiful field of inquiry," said Miss Godolphin, "and one might hesitate to decide between the contend- ing claims of objects which so deeply interest us." "I think with you, Miss Godolphin," said Mr. Claren- don; "it is one of those questions upon which a great deal may be said on both sides. Any one who visits the Louvre will find the power of art in expression so potent as to awake emotions which are rarely appealed to else- where."' "But:' said Esther, "can any thing equal the power of language?" "I thank you," said De Vane, "for that question; I was ;bout to ask it myself; for I can not believe that any art can rival language in the power of expression-the lan- guage of passion, I mean, which poetry is." "Now, Miss Godolphin," said Mr. Clarendon, "it be- comes you to sit arbitress between these contending par- ties, for I believe you have not committed yourself" "Not as yet," she said. "Nor have I,"said he; " but I incline to the arts." \     256            DE VANE. "So do I," said Waring; "but it is not easy to decide between objects of so much interest, as Miss Godolphin felicitously says." "I have never seen the original of the Dying Gladiator," said De Vane, "but there is in my home a very superior copy, large and finely executed.   My father brought it from Rome. I have often admired it, studied it, thought that I entered into ail the sentiments which it was intend- ed to express, and I was profoundly affected by it. Some time since, in reading Childe Harold, I found a description of the scene which art had essayed to suggest, so far transcending the work itself, which, mute yet powerful, had awakened in me strong emotions, that I felt as if I had never comprehended it before." "Repeat the lines, if you please," said Mrs. Springfield, who was deeply interested in the conversation. De Vane bowed to her, and said: "I think I can recall them: 'I see before me the gladiator lie: He leans upon his hand; his manly brow Consents to death, but conquers agony, And his drooped head sinks gradually low; And through his side the last drops, ebbing slow From the red gash, fall heavy, one by'one, Like the first of a thunder-shower; and now The arena swims around him-he is gone, Ere ceased the inhuman shout which hailed the wretch who won. 'He heard it, but he heeded not-his eyes Were with his heart, and that was far away: He reeked not of the life he lost-nor prize; But where his rude hut by the Danube lay, Tgere were his young barbarians all at play- There was their Dacian mother--he, their sire, Butchered to make a Roman holiday: All this rushed with his blood. .. .   DE VANE.         257 Miss Godolphin's eyes were liquid, and the tears rolled down the cheeks 6f Esther. "The lines are surpassingly fine," said Mrs. Clarendon, whose eyes were moist. "A finer illustration of the power of descriptive verse," said Mr. Springfield, "it would be hard to find." "Indeed it would," said Waring. 'Now," said De Vane, "you observe the power of poetry in expression. The sculptor represents a dying man, full of manliness; the gash, the dripping blood, the drooping head, are all seen. But the poet comes in, and he invests the dying form with the deepest 'moral interest. The tenderest sympathies of our nature are appealed to. The dying man is a father. By the distant Danube, his boys, all unconscious of his fate, are at play; and their 'Dacian mother, widowed already, does not know it, but for long days will look for his coming, but look in vain." Every one who heard him, exhibited emotion. Uncon- sciously, he threw the power of his own eloquence into the description, and it was irresistible. "I very well remember," said Mr. Clarendon, "to have seen the statue; and I must Iconfess that my sensibilities were never touched as they hive just now been by your description." "I saw-A, too," said Miss Godolphin, "not a great while since, and it never moved me as the words uttered by Mr. De Vane have done. I looked at it as a work of art. Its moral aspect had not occurred to me." "It was injured at one time," said Mr. Clarendon. "The right arm is a restoration by Michael Angelo." "Still," said Waring, "what are the lines but a descrip- tion of a work of art? Did not the statue awaken in a man of genius the very sentiments it was intended to em- body?" Oh! no,"' said De Vane, " the artist, it is believed, only     258         DE VANE. intended to express his idea of manly death; of a dying man exhibiting all of life that was left in him, in its grand- est form. The power of expression in the poetry far tran- scends that of the statue itself." "Walking one day," said Mr. Clarendon, "through the Louvre, I entered the Spanish gallery, and my attention was arrested by the figure of a prostrate man in deep grief. I stood, and studied the painting; it was one of great power; and it proved to be a representation of the repenting grief of St. Peter. The conception of the artist was a high triumph of genius. I had been accustomed to depict the apostle as bowed down with the weight of his grief, unable to lift his head, and his whole form prostrate. This was the picture of my imagination. Not so that of the Spanish painter. He represents St. Peter kneeling; his body drooping forward, but the face upturned, as if the eyes were seeking some revealing light which might shed the faintest gleam over the darkness of his spirit; and his mouth was open, the muscles too much relaxed by the anguish of his soul to support the lower jaw. The ihands were clasped, but not upraised; and the whole expression was that of unutterable but not rayless grief. Sorrow had deepened into agony, which could be expressed in no way but by the attitude, the tears, the uplifted face of the apostle, wounded by a look from his Lord. Now, I had again and again read the account of the fall of St. Peter, as it stands in the inspired record, and I had read, too, what sacred poetry could utter in delineating it; but none of its lines rivaled the simple, touching narrative of the Evangelist, who informs us that when the Lord turned and looked upon Peter, he went out and wept bit- terly. Still, I must say, that account, affecting as it is, did not awaken in me the emotions excited by the picture in the Spanish gallery of the Louvre." Every one was moved by the statement of Mr. Claren-   DE VANE.          259 don. Iis fine manner and extraordinarily earnest tones made a deep impression. "After ail," said Mr. Springfield, "Miss Godolphin will find it a hard task to decide between the power of poetry and art." "Oh! yes," said she, "I must decline it." A servant entered with ices and fruits; and Mr. Claren- don said: "We revel in luxuries this evening. Poetry, the arts, fruits, flowers, ices. The ancients never equaled us with all their boasted civilization." "I am  afraid that you will rouse my friend De Vane into opposition again," said Waring, "if you exalt modern civilization to any thing like equality with that of the ancients." "Ah! yes," said Mr. Clarendon; " but I shall put him on the defensive this time, if he seeks strife; and until he can cite some authority to show that any thing the ancients possessed could rival these peaches, and this iced sherbet, I shall decline to argue." "Preferring, I suppose," said De Vane, "to enjoy the gifts that come from the gods, without inquiring whether they are partial in their favors." "No," said Mr. Clarendon, "I have learned to prize what I possess, and to live with contentment, imbued with the spirit of those fine lines which your Professor of Moral Philosophy at the College sometimes, quotes: 'To be resigned when ills betide, Patient when favors are denied, Thankful for favors given- This, dear Chloe, is wisdom's part, This is that incense of the heart Whose fragrance smells to heaven.'" "Except," said De Vane, " in politics." I'     260    .DE VANE. Oh!" said Mr. Clarendon, "I meant to be understood of the gifts bestowed upon our physical nature. I fear that I am any thing but contented with my lot in other respects; and I am especially impatient under this prone Administration, which, however, if it should please Heaven, we shall soon expel." "Things are looking well, then?" said Mr. Springfield. "Everywhere, even in New-England," replied Mr. Claren- don; " and New-York is sure for us." "I am anxious to see General Jackson," said Miss Go- dolphin. "I learn that he is a real hero." "He is," said Mr. Clarendon, "in his character and his exploits both." "I have seen him," said De Vane. "He called at my father's residence, just before I left home, on his return from Washington, having gone some considerable distance out of his way to confer with my father upon public affairs." "Do describe him to us," exclaimed Miss Godolphin. "His appearance impressed me. I was returning from an evening's shooting, and as I approached the house, I saw standing by the side of my father, in the gallery of the house, which was open to the western sky, a tall, somewhat slightly-built gentleman, dressed in black. He was with- out a hat, and the declining light of the evening fell upon his person. His hair, somewhat gray, stood up from his forehead. He wore a pair of gold-framed glasses, and another pair, thrown up above the forehead, rested on his hair. His eyes, were piercing, and their fire could be read through his glasses. The face and head were long; and there was a character of unmistakable firmness seated upon his features. As I approached the house, my father called to me, and advancing, he presented me to General Jackson, who received me with an air of courtly dignity. I was very much impressed by the stately elegance of his man- ners, for I had expected to meet a rough Western soliier."   DE VANE.  -       261 "Thank you," said Miss Godolphin. "You have height- ened my interest in him."  "He is distinguished," said Mr. Clarendonl "for courtly grace. There is said to be something very fascinating in his manners." Mr. Clarendon rose and took leave. Soon after, Miss Godolphin's carriage was announced, and Xaring accom- panying her to it, and driving with her t Mrs. Haber- sham's, De Vane lingered a little while longer, as if re- luctant to quit a place which had become so dear to him." As he rose to leave, Mr. Springfield said to him: "I hope we shall see you again, Mr. De Vane, before you leave for Virginia." "Yes, thank you," said he, "I shall call. It is my in- tention to start on Monday, and I shall call in the mean while. Good night!" He bowed very low, and walked away alone, saddened by the thought of his cominlg leave-taking.     CHAPTER   XXII. "*FAREWELL! thou art too dear for my possessing, And like enough thou know'st thy estimate." SHAKESPEARE. To turn away from the presence of those who are dear to us, even when it is believed that the separation will be for but a few weeks, is no light task. The uncertainties that attend us in life, at every step, admonish us that great changes may occur before we tread again the same, walks, or wander through the same grounds, or seat ourselves in old familiar spots; and the shadow of indefinable dread, dread of we know not what, steals over our souls. Who has turned away from home without pausing to look back, to re-take upon the heart the tracery of the place in all its features? Who has said "Farewell!" to one really loved without looking earnestly, if but for a moment, into the dear eyes, as if the soul might be read in their clear depths? Who that has stood upon the vessel's deck, as the swift winds bore it away from the shore, looking back to see a loved form growing fainter every moment, and watching the fading away of the signals which are thrown out to us when the voice can no longer speak what the soul longs to utter-who has not felt how hard it is to say FAREWELL? Who can say what may happen before we meet again?  Life! what sadness there is in thy mu- tations! Who could read thy heart-history without sink- ing under its revelations? Nothing but trust-trust in the constancy of those we love, trust in the unslumbering (262)   DE VANE.         263 watchfulness of Him who careth even for the sparrow- can comfort us. Are ye not of more value than many sparrows? On Saturday morning, De Vane called at Mr. Spring- field's, to take leave of the family. Neither that gentleman nor Esther was at home, but Mrs. Springfield was. De Vane entered, and was informed by her that Mr. Spring- field had gone a mile or two into the country, and that Esther was passing the day at Leasowes. He entered into conversation with Mrs. Springfield with his accustomed freedom. His respect, his affection for her -for he had learned to regard her with a sentiment which was strong enough to be called affection-always made him frank with her, when they were alone. Her fine, cul- tivated mind, and the refinement and gentleness which gave an indescribable charm to her manners, made her a most agreeable person to every one, but especially so to a young, high-toned, ardent man, who could say to her much that he would not utter to one less qualified to comprehend and to sympathize with him. "And you leave us on Monday, Mr. De Vane?" she said. "On Monday, madam, I am sorry to say. I have been so long here, that I have learned to love this place, and I can never feel at home anywhere else." "Perhaps, when you re-visit Virginia," she said, you may find all your early attachments revive." "No," said he, "that is impossible. If I had not changed, it might be so; the impressions made upon me here might give way to impressions which objects there will make. But I myself am changed. I came here young, with views, tastes, and habits formed in the midst of those who make their own world, who lead a life so artificial as to unfit them for participating in the tasks of real life. Here I have learned to look upon the world as it is; to compre- eN     264         DE VANE. hend that the true grandeur of life does not consist in sur- rendering the soul to the frigid conventionalisms of society, in the indulgence of exclusive ideas, but in the manly dis- charge of the great duties of humanity. Here my mind has been awakened. My view of the world is as much en- larged as if the mists which heretofore allowed me to see but a small part of the landscape had been swept away, and the whole wide extent of hill and valley, and moun- tain and plain, sketched before me, flooded with the sun- light. I shall re-visit Virginia, but I shall never again be the person I was when I took leave of my home to come to this place." He spoke with great animation. He had risen from his seat, and unconsciously elevated hitnself to his full height. Mrs. Springfield smiled. She saw with the highest satis- faction this irrepressible exhibition of the noble nature of the young patrician, whose soul was asserting its right to sympathy with the great world, and contending against the restraints with which ancestral pride would bind it. "Still,. Mr. De Vane," she said, "you will find, upon your return to the home of your youth, so much to interest you, that it will be no easy task to tear yourself away from it once more. At your age, we are ardent. We yield a ready sympathy with those persons whose tastes are agreeable to us, and who are actually present. The im- pressions made by other objects begin to fade,'and we, after a while, almost wonder that their influence over us should have been so strong.' "Ah! madam," said De Vane, "you judge me by the commonplace code of the world. I have no right to com- plain of it. You do not know me. But my own conscious- ness vindicates me from meriting any such accusation." Mrs. Springfield saw that she had wounded him, and she hastened to assure him that she did not rank him with that   DE VANE.         265 light class of young persons who change with the skies under which they pass. ' You well know, Mr. De Vane," she said, "my estimate of you. But you are about to undergo an ordeal the full severity of which you yourself can not comprehend, until you find yourself in the midst of the objects which will appeal so powerfully to your affections, your tastes, your ambition." "Pardon me, madam," said De Vane, "I comprehend all. You must remember' that my aunt, Mrs. De Vane, has kept me well informed of all that transpires at home. She has all the while contributed what she could to strengthen miy early tastes, to remind me of the claims of my family ipon me, and to maintain over me the influence of caste. I recall very vividly all the past. I have never lost the vision of aristocratic splendor which filled my youthful mind. But I assure you, that I myself have un- dergone a great change. The great world has been revealed to me, and I can never unlearn what I have learned." "Still," said Mrs. Springfield, " you must not forget that 'the young Abyssinian Prince, after seeing the great world as you have done, returned to his happy valley." "True," said De Vane, "but that was because he saw the world only as one views a panorama. He took no part in it. It was not the actual; the living, breathing world that he saw, but a succession of pictures. The world that the young Prince saw was but little more than an exhibi- tion of the paintings of the great masters. I have walked through the actual world. I comprehend it. I disdain the idle, luxurious life which our aristocracy lead. I intend to take part in the real struggle of humanity, and strive to help forward the crowded ranks who, like pilgrims; are seeking some happier clime. There are tasks that must be done. I am not unambitious, but I aspire to wear honors won by own exertions. I could not content myself to sit 12     266         T)DE ANE. down and enjoy what better and truer men even than myself had achieved for me." Mrs. Springfield looked at him, with a respect and admi- ration that her face revealed, without replying immediate- ly to what he had said. He walked across the floor, and stood before the portrait of Esther. The morning light touched the picture, and the canvas glowed with life. De Vane fixed his eyes on it, and seemed unconscious of the presence of Mrs. Springfield. He stood before it for minutes, absorbed, motionless. The peerless beauty of Esther seemed to hold him entrancedc At length he breathed deeply, turned away from the picture, and resumid his seat without uttering a word. Mrs. Springfield spoke. "How long do you suppose, Mr. De Vane, you will be absent from us?" "I ropose," said he, "to return in October. I1 shall acquailt my father with my wish to make my residence in this place. It will require some little time to arrange my affairs in Virginia; but so soon as I can dispose of them, I shall return here. This is to be my home." "We shall be very happy to have you with us, Mr. De Vane," she replied. "You know our appreciation of you." De Vane bowed. After some further conversation, he rose to take leave. "Will you not come to us this evening?" asked Mrs. Springfield. "With great pleasure, madam," hie replied. "My friend, Mr. Waring, will doubtless accompany me." "We shall be most happy to see you," said Mrs. Spring field. De Vane walked away from the house. He greatly de- sired to see Esther alone, before leaving for Virginia. He had no well-defined purpose in seeking a private inter- view, but still he was unwilling to quit the place without conversing with her under less restraint than he must be   DE VANE.          267 subject to if he met her in the presence of others. He directed his steps to Heasowes. Entering the grounds, he walkbd directly to the cotta e. Mrs. Green received him. Esther was not in, but Mrs. Green informed him that she was somewhere in the grounds; that she had taken Mary Sinclair with her, and walked out some half-hour since. De Vane went in search of her. He turned his steps to- ward the fountain; and as he approached it, he saw Esther and little Mary seated side by side. Esther instantly rose to meet him. "Pardon me," said De Vane, " for trespassing upon you, Miss Wordsworth. You know that I leave for Virginia on Monday, and I could not tear myself away without once more visiting Leasowes. The place has become very dear to me."   "You know, Mr. IDe Vane," she replied, " how welcome you are here. You are never an intruder." 'Thanks," said De Vane. "There is no spot in the world that I visit with so much pleasure." Esther rewarded ]him with her brightest Smile. She invited him to be seated. "No," said he. "If agreeable to you, let us. walk through the grounds. It vill lbe some months before I can enjoy that privilege again." Esther took Mary by the hand, and they turned their steps toward the cottage. She excused herself for a mo- ment, and entering the house with the little girl, she pres- ently returned alone, with her hat, and a light shawl thrown about her shoulders. "Come, Mr. De Vane," she said, "let us see what im- provements Jacob has been projecting since you were here." They turned their steps toward the more highly culti- vated parts of the grounds. They were in their full glory. Brilliant flowers grew in the midst of the beds. The farest and most beautiful shrubbery fringed the walks,     268         DE VANE. and the highest taste was displayed in the arrangement of the grounds. One might lose himself in the labyrinthine walks. "Really," said De Vane, "this place is enchanting. It wants only statuary to make it perfect." "It has occurred to me," said Esther, "to place some few statues in some parts of the grounds. If I should ever visit Europe, I may then make the selections." "Visit Europe you certainly will," said De Vane. "With your tastes, Miss Wordsworth, you can not resist the attractions that such a tour offers." "I do not know, Mr. De Vane," she replied. "There is so much to bind me here, that I can not hope very soon to gratify my tastes." "You wrong yourself, Miss Wordsworth," said De Vane. "Your life must not be passed in this way." Esther turned upon him her full glance. "I-ave you forgotten, Mr. De Vane, the obligations that rest upon me?" "Oh! no," he answered; " but surely, all the brightness of your life is not to be obscured in this spot, beautiful as it is."  "I have no fixed plans for the future," said Esther; "none beyond the simple performance of duties which are too sacred to be neglected." "You will, I trust, take brighter views of life," said De Vane. "The tasks which you perform here are beautiful; and I should be uncandid if I did not say, that my admi- ration is yielded to you as it has never been to any one, when I see you at Leasowes. Still, I should be very sorry to know that all your days were to be passed here." He turned to Esther as he uttered these words, and his face revealed even more than his language had disclosed. He fixed his ardent gaze upon her, as if his soul would   DE VANE.         269 utter its emotions in a glance, while the lips refused to breathe the passion. which fired it. Esther was deeply agitated. This frank declaration of his admiration for her, just uttered by De Vane, startled her. She made no reply. "Yes, Miss Wordsworth," he continued, "I am too self- ish to wish to see you always engaged as you now are, beautiful as the tasks that employ you must be acknow- ledged to be by all who can appreciate the high qualities that prompt you to discharge them. I am too selfish for that. I would appeal to you, too, in behalf of the great world. You must help to make that brighter. You must walk through it, that other eyes may see you and bless you." "I thank you, Mr. De Vane," at length Esther said, "for all your kindness. Here I feel that I am safe. These duties have been enjoined upon me in a way that renders it impossible to disregard them. I am a little afraid of the great world of which you speak." She spoke with trembling earnestness; and as she ut- tered these words, she looked into the face of De Vane, with a gentleness so perfect, and a truthfulness so clear, that he felt as if he walked by the side of a being who, if not celestial, had at least the purity of thosswhose robes have never been sullied by the dust of the world's crowded ways. They walked on for some moments in silence. Their, walk conducted toward the gate that opened into the town. The silence was a length broken by De Vane. "Miss Wordsworth," h said, "I know the frankness of your nature. I am about to speak to you freely-as freely as I am at liberty to do at this moment. As you know, I am just now about to re-visit my home-the home of my youth-my ancestral home. But it is my fixed purpose to return here; and if I can secure the approval of my i i     270          DE VANE. father, I shall make this my residence. Separated from you for some weeks to come, as I must be, I will not with- hold the expression of my great regard for you. A purer fiienidslip never warmed the heart of any man than that which I cherish for you. May I hope that you will not re- gard me with' entireindifference, and that you will permit me to call you my friend?" Esther colored deeply. She hesitated for a moment, and then said with a steady voice: "Yes, Mr. De Vane, I am sincerely your fiiend. I should be ungratefil if I were not so." "Thank you," said De Vane. "There is surely no con- sideration that can entitle me to your gratitude, Miss Worlds wortl. It is I who should speak of gratitude. You have shed a briglltness over my life. But I do not like the word. I am speaking of friendship. I should prize your fi'iendship unspeakably." "I have already said to you, Mr. De Vane," said Esther, "tlhat I am your/ielnd. F1or yourself and Mr. Waring, I entertain a sentiment that certainly deserves the name; and a: s the circle of my friends is not very large, I prize those \wlo belong to it." De Vane was a little disappointed in this reply. He regarded Waring as he did no other man on earth; but to hear Miss Wordsworth associate him with himself in one coniinon selltiment of friendship, was a little chilling to himl. Still he could not complain of it; nor could he make any explanation. He had not spoken of love. That was quite another thing. He dared not speak of it. He well knew the settled purpose of General De Vane; his aristo- cratic tastes, his ancestral pride, his hopes of his sOn, his plans of life for him. He comprehended, too, Mrs.) De Vane's tastes, prejudices, preferences, pride, and ambition. All this rose before him at the moment. Could he disre- gard it? Was he to make a rash declaration of love to   DE VANE.         271 a young girl who walked by his side in her maidenly purity, belonging to a class so widely different from the aristocratic circle in which he had been reared? The surges of his passion swept furiously against the restraints that he placed on himself. Like the North Sea dashing against the dykes of Holland, his passion shook the barriers that kept it back. Would the wild waves break over the obstructions? It seemed impossible to shut them out. De Vane burned to know the real senti- ments of Esther respecting him. Did she love him? Or was it only friendship? What would he give to resolve the doubt! There stood the young priestess, glowing with almost unearthly beauty. Was she cold? Or did the hidden flame of passion burn in the deep of her soul? They had reached the gate. Unconsciously they both stood, and they were silent. De Vane struggled with his passion. What right had he to ask this young bright being who stood by his side to speak to him of love? Would he darken her woman's sky? Would he humiliate her by invitiVg her to walk with him through life, when she must encounter the scorn of his imperious father, the reproaches even of his aunt? He was by no means sure of the state of Esther's heart. She might regard him simply as a friend. He could not trifle with her. He had too much principle to make an experiment of such a nature as would induce her to reveal her real sentiments, without being ready to bind, himself to her, if she were willing, by an indissoluble engagement. His own pride, his lofty sense of honor, his profound re- spect for Esther-all made it impossible that he should ad- vance a single step beyond the line that he had reached. The struggle was over. PRINCIPLE had triumphed over PASSION. "I thank you, Miss Wordsworth," said De Vane, "for having admitted me to the circle of your friends. I shall     272          DE VANE. bear with me to Virginia the consciousness that, in quit- ting these happy grounds, I leave behind me one who will sometimes recall the hours that we have passed together in these walks." "Yes, Mr. De Vane, you may rest assured that I am your fiiend," said Esther. "And when I return, may I reenter this portal," said De Vane, "confident that I shall still find a friend here?" "You need not doubt it," said Esther. "I am not sub- ject to change." "Thank you," said De Vane, " thank you." They passed through the gate into the great world. In the evening, De Vane and Waring walked to M4. Sprillgfield's. They were expected. Every thing was arranged with perfect taste, and the rooms wore their most cheerful aspect. Mrs. Springfield, with womanly tact, sought to surround De Vane, on this last evening, with bright objects-objects that he would recall with pleasure after his departure. Flowers, fruits, and the innumerable pleasing things that belong to such a household, were in profusion. The supper was an abound- ing one. After it was ended, all assembled in the library, and engaged in cheerful conversation. "So, Mr. De Vane," said Mr. Springfield, "you will leave us. We shall regret your absence, and hope that you will return to us as early as possible." "You may rest assured of that, sir," said De Vane. "The journey will, of course, consume some time; and as I intend to fix my residence here, it will require some weeks to put my affairs in Virginia in such a condition that I may leave them." "It is quite settled, then, is it," asked Mr. Springfield, "that ybu will make this your future home?" "So far as I can settle it," said De Vane, "the question   DE VANE.         273 is disposed of. I anticipate great opposition to my plan on the part of my father. He is very decided, I may say inflexible, upon most subjects; but I do not despair of be- ing able to obtain his consent that I may fix my residence here. I hold that questions of that kind are to be dispos- ed of by every one for himself. They concern our happi- ness too much to suffer us to submit them to the decision of others." "I quite agree with you," said Mr. Springfield. "I think that all such matters are to be decided by one's self. In the light of all the surroundings, certainly the wishes of friends are not to be disregarded; but after all, we can only determine for ourselves what will be agreeable to us." "So I think," said Waring. I would not live in a pal- ace on compulsion. It would be but a splendid prison." "So say I," said De Vane. "Splendor is nothing with- out liberty. And with my views of life, to compel me to sit down upon a plantation in Virginia and see my slaves toil for my benefit, adding tyear after year to the increase of an estate already too large, would be intolerable. They write to me about the glories of such an existence; they describe in glowing terms the society, made up of the best blood of the country, of the sports which are introduced to break the monotony of country life; but really they have failed to awaken in Mie any desire to lead such a life." "It must be admitted," said Mr. Springfield, " that such an existence seems to ignore the higher objects of our being." "Not only so," said Waring, "but I should die from ennui." "Yes," said De Vane, "I firmly believe that some de- gree of labor is essential to happiness. For my own part, my mind is quite made up to make my own living. I in- tend to labor; to have the honest consciousness, when I see the sun descending behind the western sky, that I have 12      274         DE VANE. contributed by my own exertions to pay my own way in the world. In no other way could I feel that I was a man." All smiled at the energy with which De Vane uttered these words. "What will General De Vane say to all that?" asked Waring. "Of course he will object," said De Vane. "But I have one appeal to make to him-I shall lay before him my views, my plans, my sentiments, my hopes, my principles. For, after all, with me this is a principle, and I shall re- mind him that he chose his own path in life; he fixed his residence just where he pleased. Therefore, I may well ap- peal to his sense of right, to allow me to do the same thing. His ancestral pride will give way before his strong sense of right and his manliness." "I certainly hope so," said Waring. "We shall await, the result of your visit with great anxiety. I say we, for you have friends here beside myself, who will be profound- ly interested in your return." De Vane could not resist the impulse which prompted him to look toward Esther. Her face was glowing. "Yes," said Mrs. Springfield; s"Mr. De Vane well knows that he has friends here, and I trust that he will count this household among the number." "A thousand thanks, madam, for the assurance," said De Vane, with emotion. "I shall often recall this spot in my travels, and whatever I may meet in Virginia, nothino can efface the happy memories that must be forever asso- ciated with it." The evening advanced. De Vane did not ask for music. He was too sad to wish to hear it. Esther felt a great relief at being spared the performance. For, though she had not analyzed her heart, she was conscious of an inter- est in De Vane too deep to permtit her to associate him   DE VANE.         275 with any ofT the commonplace things of life. If she sang, her emotion would be too visible. Indeed, to ask her to do so would be like calling on the Jewish maiden to take her harp from the willows, and strike its chords with joy- ous notes, in the midst of her exile. The hour for leave-taking came. De Vane was seated near Mr. Springfield. He rose and extended his hand to that gentleman, thanking him for all his kindness. "I am indebted to you, sir, for many happy hours," said he. "I promise myself a long enjoyment of such scenes hereafter." "God bless you, sir!" said Mr. Springfield. "We shall all welcome you upon your return." De Vane turned to Mrs. Springfield, and said: "To you, madam, I do not know how to express my thanks. You have done so much for me, that I shall always regard you as associated with my best and happiest days. Farewell, madam!" Mrs. Springfield gave him her hand, aid said: "Fare- well, Mr. De Vane. Come to us again as soon as pos- sible."  Esther had risen from her seat. She stood self-pos- sessed, and yet her eyes were lit with all the ardor of her soul. De Vane advanced to her, took her hand, stood for a moment silent, and then said: "Miss Wordsworth, fare- well!"Esther said not a word. Wariyisaid "Good-night!" to the group, and walked to the d6or. De Vane turned for a moment, made a state- ly bow, and then passed out. The door closed on the young patrician! Shall he ever enter it again? TIME and the FUTURE alone can reveal his destiny!
