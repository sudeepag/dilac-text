EUROPE IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY -A VERY INTERESTING ADVENTURB. \    "Midnight, o'er a sleeping city, Has her starry mantle cast; And the pale moon's gentle radiance, Shineth o'er the grandeur vast"' T  HE  proud and noble city of London is the A   seat we have chosen r the commence- ment of our story, ynd the stirring and rqmantio time of Henry the Eighth, King of England, the season in which our plot is laid., The first, half of the 16th century-one of the most interest- ing periods in European history, when England was ruled by one of her most renowned' kings,': France by one little less powerful-Franies H and Spain by one of the most daring and victor rious monarohs that ever sat upon her throne-- tho Emperor Charles--a,portion of this century will claim ourattention, for the succeedingpages. At the time of which. we write--1 22-the war between France and England htd  )mmnen.- wed, and the aity of London was guarded by   armed sentinels, and ferocious-looling trwpera, and a stranger could not pass the streets without giving, at each sentinel's post, the aooustomed pass-word. Night had again cast hier dark mantle over the guarded city, and the young moon sailed calmly on a blue and cloudless sky, attended by her brilliant retinue of stars. The watchful sentinels were at their aecustomed posts, and faithfully performing their duties, and all, wi- in the city was silent and still.  The dark shadows of the high, stately masons fell gloom. ily across the streets, and here and there the glimmer of a light enlivened the moonlit sene From one of the palace windows gleamed one more brilliant than the others, and often, thesen- tinel paused in his measured walk, . dapd 'd wonderingly at the high windowr , as if za u to learn ia what manner ,the monarh oould l engaged, that his business had kept him at vAb     a late hour, as it was now past midnight. But nought could be seen through the dark, heavy curtain that shaded the window, save the bril- liant light, and the sentinel again resumed his walk, and dismissed the subject from his mind. Suddenly he paused, and listened earnestly. The tamp of horses' feet could be distinctly heard, the sound breaking the monotonous silence which reigned around. It came nearer and more distinct, and the sentinel guarding the Aentranoe to the palace court-yard, stepped more firmly, and grasped his trusty weapons more anxiously. In a few moments the horseman beoafipe visible, dashing on in the direction of the palace, apparently in haste, for the noble jet-black charger he bestrode was foaming with fatigue and excitement. "Halt, stranger, and give the pass-word!" cried the sentinel, in a voice of thunder, as he , placed his musket to the horseman's breast, and ' grasped the rein' of the foaming charger.  I The stranger'extended his left hand, upon I one of the fingers of which glittered the royal signet-ring of king Henry.          1 "That will let you pass, be you lord or slave," said the sentinel, as he released the a horse's rein, and allowed the stranger to enter t the eourt-yard. He was a tall, symmetrically ( built manr, closely wrapped in an ample cloak, I and his oountenance was concealed from view by a large and heavy cap, together with a mass E of abundant light brown hair. Hastily entering 1 the court-yard, he dismounted, and giving his t horse into the ohrge of an attendant, he said e: "Look to him  until I return, which will be I within two hours." "I will obey you," answered the page, res- a peotfully, as he gazed upon the monarch's sig- ' net-ring, 5which sparkled upon the stranger's a finger.  Hesitating but to see his horse led I away by the page, the new-comer sprang quickly up the steps leading to the palace, and with the e assistance of the ring, gained admittance. The l e light still shone brilliantry in the king's window, t and silence again reigned throughout the city. -1 "I wish to see his majesty king Henry," a oail the stranger, in a low, quick tone, to the, m   ' young soldier who guarded the palace entrance. "And why dost thou wish to confer with T him at this unseasonable hour?" asked the one addressed, as be cast a searching glance at the evidently disguised person.      , Again the stranger extended his hand upon which glittered the monarch's ring, and the sol- dier hesitated no longer. "Ah, you're the one he's been expecting. Please follow me," said the soldier, respectfully, at the same time turning to a door half con- cealed by the rich velvet drapery which fell in dark folds around it. Applying a key, the guide quickly unlocked it, and entered, follow- ed closely by the stranger. Several'long pas- sages and rich-furnished rooms were passed through, and at last they stood at the door of the chamber within which was the king. "Here I will leave you," said the young ; soldier, " for I was ordered by his majesty, to admit the man who should carry his signet-ring, at whatever hour of the night he might arrive. You can enter this room, where you will find king Henry alone." "Thanks, friend," said the stranger, and in a moment more the guide disappeared. Softly the expected visitor unclosed the richly carved door, and ente inig he stood in the presence of Henry the Eighth, King of England. "Ha, Crescelle," said the monarch, an the stranger approached him, "you have come at last. I placed the signal at the window nearly three hours since, and what could you have been engaged in, that you did not see and obey it before T' "Allow me to disencumber myself of this not very agreeable costume," answered Crescelle, "and then I will relate to you my night's adventure, which will account for my tardi- ness." Then divesting himself of the cloak, cap, and curling mass of false hair which nearly concealed his features, he turned to the king, Bowing with the grace and elegance of a finished courtier. He was tall and well-formed, and evidently about thirtj-five years-of age, with the graceful manners and polished bearing that mark the 79    high-born noble. His face was decidedly hand-' t some, and his voice and air showed that-he was tl one accustomed to command. His hair was as jet-black, and curled carefully around his head, tu as was the fashion of those days. But the most n striking and peculiar portion of his countenance, o was his eyes. They were of the blackest hue, p e and brilliant as an eye could be, while the dark tl eyebrows which hung over them added to their tl ferocious expression. The general expressions i of the countenance, though decidedly handsome, p was repulsive, for villany had stamped every v feature..                   I As he turned his darkly flashing eyes full e upon king Henry, the monarch shuddered in- c voluntarily, but he quickly recovered his self- I possession, and laughed merrily at the metamor- t phosis which /the removal of his companion's r false hair had caused.            E "Be seated, Captain Crescelle," said the i king, good-humoredly, "and let's hear your t adventure."  "Well, your majesty."           a "Don't trouble yourself about my majesty I for the present," jinterrupted the king; "I'm f not in court now, you know, and can very well E dispense with the ' your majesties,' and all other 1 court terms." Crescelle smiled, and answered good-na- turedly : "Very well, I'll leave off the ' your majes- ties,' as I can tqn the adventure just as well without them, as there did not chance to be any of those in the affair." "You must be brief, for our business must be finished by three, and it is now past one." "I will endeavor to be so. I came on store yesterday, a I told you that I should, when I last saw you; and thinking you might wish to see me, I mounted my horse and left the ren- dezvous, taking me winding path which leads towards the city. "Your signet passed me by the sentinel jand I arrived at the city Pa little past nine. As you agreed to place a brilliant light in yo-r window, if you wished me to come, I concluded not to go to the palace, as I saw no light which appeared to, be the signal I was   to obey. Having a little curiosity to know what the old sybil of the cliff was doing at this hour, as I saw a pretty bright light in her window, I turned my horse's head up the path, and had nearly reached the old woman's cottage, when, chancing to cast my eyes in the direction of the palace, I saw your signal, so brilliant and clear, that it could not be mistaken. I forgot all about the sybil jery quickly, and immediately turn- ing around, I commenced descending the rocky path. I had nearly gained the end of the path, when I saw another person approaching, which I soon discovered was a lady. I much wonder- ed that she should be there at that hour, but concluded it must be the old sybil, returning home from some of her mysterious visits. As the lady drew nearer, I perceived that she was richly dressed, and evidently young. Just as she was passing me, her horse stumbled against something which lay in the path, and she was thrown upon the ground. I sprang from  my horse, and took her insensible form up in my arms, and as the moonbeams fell upon her face, I saw that it was of the most remarkable and faultless beauty. The fall had considerably stunned her, for she was insensible, and as I had taken the south path, it was but a few rods to the beach, and I soon reached it with my precious burthen. After bathing her hands and brow for a few moments, she revived, and opened her eyes and smiled so sweetly upon me, that my heart has not been my own since." "I did not knows as you buccaneers ever had hearts to lose?" remarked the king, in a ; tone of irony. Crescelle only frowned, and continued: 3 "I carried her gently in my arms to where [ stood both our horses, extremely amazed at the a conduct of their riders. By this time the young - lady was able to stand with my assistance, and s she thanked me most kindly for my timely aid. r I offered to assist her to any destination she e would name, but she assured me she could easily t ride the remainder of her way alone. I assistei , her to mount her horse, and she slowly pro- w ceeded up the path, and soon reached the sybii's ,s dwelling. The beautiful girl had fascinated     me-and I had turned my horse's head almost before I was aware of it, and was following the fair angel up the path. I reached the sybil's home a few moments after the maiden entered and as the door was half open, I heard enough to convince me that the young lady intended re. turning soon, and I determined to follow her, and ascertain her place of residence, if possible. I heard the voice of the sybil, endeavoring to dissuade the lovely stranger from returning that night, but the girl was firm. Most of their con- versation was in low tones, and I was unable to asoertain what passed between them. At last the young lady rose to leave, and I concealed myself in the shadow of a large tree, and there remained until she had nearly reached the end of the path. - The light of the moon, which shone very brightly, enabled me to follow her without difficulty, or danger of exciting suspicion in her ,mind that any one was watching her. "She passed on toward the city, and I fol- i lowed her at a distance, but all the' while keep- i ing her in sight. The pass-word for to-night- i * parliament "-she gave as she passed the sen- tinels, while your signet-ring was enough for me. t At length, she stopped at the splendid mansion of the Count de Valence, and giving her horse to the oelrge of a servant, she sprang up the * stps of the mansion and entered, and I saw no b more of her. Just then, for the first time since I I had seen the fascinating beauty, I thought of your signal, and quickly turningmy horse's head, b I  came in haste to hear your commands. You must pardon my forgetfulness, for I was perfect- hi ly fascinated by the lovely girl."    th "You say she stopped  at the mansion of in i Count de Valence?" asked the king, quickly.  m "She did*."   "Had she dark hair and eyes, brunette comr sA plexion, full red lips, and a  light, graceful form r" i  "Youhave described her perfectly."    of "Then I   can tell you who this beatiful the it agel is." J ," Indeed!"                wh I  "She is the Lady Eustatia L'Elive, niece of lan it&e CowMtde Valence.  She is the reigning Nc !f   Dst' belle of London, though she has been in the eity he but a few weeks. Both the count and his niece I's are from Paris, and very distinguished persons d, they are indeed." "h  "And she is very beautiful. Nover have I e- seen such an exquisite form, or faultless coun- r, tenance." e.  "What! you, who have seen the dark-eyed to maidens of Spain, Italy, and  Circassia, pro- It nounoe a French girl more beautiful than them a- all?" o  "None   of them can rival Lady Eustatia. st But why are they in England, when the Eng. d lish are such foes to the French 7" e  "The count had been  a resident here for d some time before the war commenced, and e deeming lisi fair niece unsafe amid the tumult t and confusion of Paris, brought her to London, r where she has since become a belle." "And among 'her numerous admirers, there - is probably one who has gained her favor; and - if there is, you, perhaps, would know who is the fortunate suitor?" "You have heard of Norville Blanchford, cap, tain of our war-ship, the Conqueror!" "  I know him well." 4"He is the accepted lover of Lady Eustatia." "Is it possible, that the man whom I most hate on earth, is the favored lover of Eustatia "Elive?" "Then you  have met Captain Blanohford W before?" The dark eyes of Creseelle flashed fire, and his, handsome countenance seemed changed to the malignant one of a demon. Suddenly spring- ing to his feet, and speaking in a quick, deter- mined tone, he exclaimed; "He shall never wed Lady Eustatia! He shall die first by my'own hand!" "Hold, Captain  Creseelle!" cried King Henry, in a commanding tone; ;' no outhurst of your anger here you are in the presence of the king of England!" "I am aware of it," said Crescelle, some- what haughtily, "but even the king of Eng land shall not prevent my standing between Norville Blanchford and his bride!"   For several moments both were silent The kiLg appeared wrapped in intense thought, but soon raising his head, he said to the -still angry Creseelle: "I have a proposal to make to you, which, if you accept, and are successful in the accomplish- ment of it, I will promise that within three weeks from the time that it is accomplished, Lady Eustatia shall be in your power." Every trace of passion vanished instantly from the countenance of Creseelle, and approaching the king, he eagerly awaited the unfolding of his scheme. "Now listen," continued the monarch, " and I will tell you for what I wished you to come to- night. You know Captain Blanchford, I feel assured from your behaviour. He commands one of our best war-ships, and for some time has been endeavoring to capture the Orient, one of the French king's large and well-manned war- vessels, but cannot succeed. The- Orient is a powerful ship, and Francis relies upon her to protect the coast along the bay, and if she was but removed, we could easily take Brest, Ro- chelle, and St. Brienne, which would give us' command of the bay coast. Now if you could, by some of your stratagems, take or destroy the Orient, it would be the surest harbinger of our victory." "How do you wish me to do it? Take her by fighting, or destroy her?" "Blow her up or burn her I  Anythiig to get her out of our way.!" "And if this is accomplished to your satisfao- tion, you promise that Lady Eustatia shall be mine?" "I promise that she shall be placed in your power within three weeks from the time: you destroy the Orient, if you do it."   "It shall be done " exclaimed. Creseelle, quickly.             ; "Have you a powerful and fast-ssiling ship?" asked the king. i"A fine brigantine. She sails like a bird, and is well manned and armed. No ship in your navy can outsail her." "What is her name?" "The Victory." "And I hope in this enterprise she will be victorious. If you would wish to see again the fascinating Lady Eustatia, before she is your own, to-morrow evening will be an excellent op- portunity, for there is to be a splendid levee at the mansion of the Count de Valence. His fair niece will be the ' admired of all admirers,' and you can have the satisfaction of knowing that you alone are to possess her." "'I shall be there. But your signet-ring-- shall I retain it?" "It is needless. You know the pass-word for to-night, and the sentinels will let you pass without the ring." Creseelle slipped the signetnring from his finger, and in a moment more it sparkled upon , the hand of king Henry. "I shall see you to-morrow evening," atid he, resuming his disguise; " and we can con- verse further upon this rsbject, if needful. I shall 'destroy the Orient, by stratagem or power."  And after a few moments more of conversation, the king of England and the Spanish buccaneer separated; the one to muse upon the probability of the Orient's mapture, and the other to mount his horse, and gallop away to the pirate's ren- I dezvous.     CHAPTER II. THE MANSION OF THB COUNT DE VALENCB.   "The masque is going merrily, And merrily the dance, While joy and pleasure summerly, Light up each merry glance!" , ]pHE proud mansion of the Count de Va- lenee was already brilliantly illuminated, and the gay guests were filling the splendid halls with music and joyousness. From the fairest and noblest of the land had the gay com- pany been selected, and many young hearts beat high with the anticipations of that evening's triumphs, and many bright eyes " looked love to eyes that spake again ;" while mirth and joy- ousness reigned supreme. Suddenly the merry laugh and busy hum of voices ceased, and a half- suppressed whisper of "the king! the king has arrived!" passed 'from lip to lip. A few mo- ments of silence and expectation elapsed, and king Henry appeared, splendidly attired in an embroidered robe of purple velvet, and attended by the Count de Valence, the Duke of Glouces- ter, and several high-born nobles and di tinish- ed courtiers. A smile of pleasure reste upr his handsome countenance, and his fine drl eyes gleamed b ightly, with the anticipatio af   the evening's pleasure. With the slow, majes- tic step of a haughty monarch, he moved to- wards a kind of throne prepared for his recep- tion, and seating himself, gazed earnestly around upon his many and noble subjects, expecting to see among them the countenance of the Spanish buccaneer. But though he gazed long and anx- iously, he could discern no one who bore any resemblance to Crescelle, and concluding that he was already engaged in some plan for cap- turing the Orient, he tiuned and entered into conversation with the courtiers who attended him.  "Where is thy fair niece, to-night?" asked the king, addressing the Count de Valence. "Does your majesty observe a young lady standing in the shade of that curtain, conversing with a nobleman?" asked the count, designa- ting it with a motion of his jewelled hand. "I perceive them now," replied the king, quickly, "but is that young girl the peerless Lady Eustatia L'Elive!" "That is my niece, your majesty," replied the count, somewhat surprised at the tone in   Crescelle, the buccaneer captain, on the deck of the brigantine. See CuaP. III.     which the monarch's words had been spoken. While both were gazing at the young girl, who stood in the shadow of a dark, heavy curtain, she suddenly stepped forward, and the brilliant light of the many splendid lamps fell boldly upon her surpassingly lovely features. The king uttered an exclamation of delight and sur- prise, for he had never before seen Lady Eusta- tia so brilliantly beautiful. Around her neck and shoulders of faultless symmetry, fell rich clusters of soft, bewitching, raven curls, con- trasting beautifullywith her splendidly embroid- ered dress of white satin. A brow, fair and noble, was half shaded by the clustering ring- lets, while in those dark, brilliant, soul-thrilling eyes, gleamed a woman's loveliness, and a wo. man's pride. Around the sweet, finely-chiselled lips, played a smile angelic in its expression, for it was of mingled love, gentleness and beauty. The richest vermilion tinged the rounded cheek and the curved lips, and the whole countenance was strangely, surpassingly beautiful. By the side of Eustatia stood a dark, hand- some young man, with brown curling hair, and brilliant black eyes, and with whom she seemed engaged in an interesting conversation. He wore the rich costume of a courtier, and around his lips played a winning, captivating smile. Many a fair lady's eye was fixed upon the handsome stranger, for stranger he evidently was, notwithstanding, he wore the dress of an English noble. "Who is that handsome stranger, Lady Eus- tatia?" asked a fair and high-born lady, as the peerless belle passed near her. "The Earl of Gordon," replied Eustatia, quickly. "Is he an acquaintance of yours, Lady Eus- tatia?"  "I have never seen him before to-night." "Indeed!" ejaculated the English beauty, piqued at the French belle's haughty manner. The young Earl of Gordon again approached Eustatia, and in a low, musical voice, solicited her hand for the next dance. She glanced anx- iously towards the entrance to thepmagnificently illuminated hall, and then turning to the hand- I '   ' ' -           !   some earl, gave him a glance that told him his request was granted. Gaily sounded the merry music, and still merrier voices, and brighter glowed the cheek of the fair Lady Eustatia, as the young earl took her hand, and led her to where stood a gay group of dancers, busily en- gaged in conversation. Suddenly the musicians commenced a gay, lively tune, and springing to their feet, the whole group were. soon tripping merrily in the " mazy dance.' Brightly glit- tered the splendid tiara of diamonds upon the fair brow of the peerless Eustatia, but brighter still gleamed those dark, thrilling eyes, which shone beneath the brilliant ornaments, and far more quickly would they attract the gazer's eye. As the handsome Earl of Gordon and the young belle moved gracefully across the smooth dan- cing floor, all eyes were turned upon them, and many an envious maiden would have given her heart for one smile of love from the elegant and polished stranger. But he seemed to admire no one but the beautiful Lady Eustatia, and upon her alone did he smile. "They are a splendid couple," observed the king, as the dance was finished, and the earl led the fair lady from the crowded and illuminated hall, to the cool, star-lit balcony. And the no- bles and courtiers who stood around the mon- arch, echoed his words, and felt that the Earl of Gordon was indeed a fit suitor for the hand of the high-born and beautiful Lady Eastatia. The light, fresh breeze fanned back the darlk clustering ringlets from the beauty's brow, and as the softening beams of the gentle moon fell upon her countenance, the young earl thought if angels were half so lovely, he could worship them for their radiant beauty alone He gazed upon the bright stars, twinkling afar off in the blue heavens, like gems of light, but the dark eyes of Eustatia seemed to surpass even them in brilliancy, and from heavenly beauty, he turned to gaze upon earthly. "It is indeed a lovely night," spoke the mu- sical voice of the maiden, " for all nature seems hushed and quiet, and the fair moon looks down as if approvingly, upon all. I cannot but ad- mire the beautiful scene, for it calms my feelings and soothes all evil passions to repose."     "It is a lovely scene, fairest lady," replied the earl; " and the young moon ia fair indeed, but it looks down upon a countenance more love- ly, ay, many, many times more beautiful, -than its own, and there are eyes gazing upon it, more brilliant than its own radiance. Forgive me, fairest Eustatia, and charge me not with flattery, when I tell thee that it is thou which art most beautiful!" The young maiden blushed deeply, but an- swered not. Though she had been flattered by noble lords and handsome courtiers, never had she heard a voice so thrillingly musical, before address her in that manner. The earl marked the blush, and the expression of her countenance, and falling upon his knees and seizing her jew- elled hand, he passionately exclaimed: "Lady Eustatia, I can control my heart no longer! I must speak! And here, beneath the light of that cloudless moon, I will tell thee of my burning, lasting, unchanging love, and ask thine, adored idol of my heart, in return " For a moment, the surprised girl was silent, but quickly recovering her self-possession, she withdrew her hand and was about to speak, when the earl again caught it, exclaiming: "O, fairest angel, be not thus unkind! Give me thine hand, and the blessed hope that I may call it mine forever!" Eustatia endeavored to draw back her hand, but the earl held it fast, in both of his. Seeing that she must' answer his passionate words in  some manner, she, quickly said: "My lord, you could not wish my hand, if my heart went not with it, a free gift 1" "But why cannot thy heart go with it?" "It is another's!" "And canst thou never love me?" "Never!" "Lady Eustatia," saii the earl, rising and assuming a cold, haughty look; * Lady Easta. tia, I will leave you, as you can never love me, and I wish not your hand without your whole and undivided heart. May he who has gained thy affections prove worthy of thee, and make thee lastingly happy, but he ean never love thee as I have done Farewell, forever!"   And springing from her. side, he entered the mansion and she was alone. The words--" but he can never love thee as I have done!" rang in her ears, and for the first time in her life, a strange feeling of loneliness crept over her mind, that she could not repel. She thought of her absent lover-the one who had gained her heart's free affections, and vowed to love but her alone, and the thought that he might not love her as deeply as the one who had just left her side, overpowered her, and she gave vent to her feelings in a burst of passionate tears. A light step startled her, and a moment after, an arm was thrown about her waist, and a well- known voice whispered: "Why art thou weeping, dearest Eustatia?" "Norville, dear Norville!" exclaimed the maiden, joyously, raising her head and smiling through her tears. "I had despaired of seeing thee, to-night, but thy presence now makes me forget all my sad thoughts." "But why art thou sad, Etstatia?" "It was nothing, N orville," answered the fair girl, blushing, * but a presentiment-a fore- boding, which thy comirg has entirely chased away, -that rendered me for a moment sad." "But it would please me if thou wouldst tell me what could make such a fair being as thou art unhappy?" said the- young man, as he gazed lovingly into the upturned face of his beautiful comlpailion. "As you came here, Norville, did you ob- serve a young man just enteriig the hall from the balcony-" ' Dressed in the co;tume of an earl, with a bold, handsome countenance, and fiery black eyes '?" "Yes." I saw him, but thought he was a stranger." *"He is. This evening is the first time I have ever seen him. but I think he has, at some time long past, seen me in Paris. My uncle, the Count de Valence, introduced him to me as the Earl of Gordon. He has been very atten- tive to me this evening, and prevented' me from feeling any attack of ennui, in consequence of your absence. We danced, laughed, and con-   versed with the familiarity of old friends; and I have no doubt half the ladies here envied me the attentions of the handsome earl. I had not the smallest idea of captivating him, and there- fore was both surprised and displeased when here, on this very spot, a few moments since, he made a most ardent declaration of love to ;,.I / I told him my heart was another's, and that seemed to cheek his ardor considerably. His parting words were what struck me, and caused the train of thought which led me to the burst of weeping in which you found me." "And what could those words be?" "When he arose to leave me, he looked me fall in the face, and said in a tone that I shall never forget, ' May he who has gained thy affec- tions prove worthy of thee, and make thee last- ingly happy, but he can never love thee as I have done.' The thought that you, Norville, could not love me as deeply as one who was almost a stranger, overpowered me, and I burst into tears." "But could you doubt my love, Eustatia?" "No, Norville, no!" "And that thou wilt love and trust me as I have loved and trusted thee, dearest Eustatia, is the earnest prayer of one who would give up his life for thy sake, if it was needed. My heart is with thee when absent, and I indeed feel lone- ly when thou art gone, but in thy presence, I am blest. And, Eustatia, if I possess that priceless treasure, thine undivided heart, I may well be happy." "Norville," said the maiden, in a low, musi- cal voice, " my heart is thine alone. Though wealth, honor, and the love of noble hearts have been offered to me, still I am true, and will ever be, unto eternity. In joy or sorrow, in life or death, I am thine, and thine forever!" The lover pressed the unresisting girl to his heart, and his cup of happiness seemed filled to overflowing. No cloud was visible in thefuture, no tempest gathering its force to burst in fury upon him, but all was beauty, light and joy. As he entered the illuminated hall where all was mirth and gaiety, with his charming Eustatia by his side, it was whispered from lip to lip, that   none could be handsomer, or more noble-look- ing, than young Captain Blanchford and the peerless Lady Eustatia. Many were the conflicting emotions that filled the heart of the young Earl of Gordon, as he entered the splendid hall, after declaring his love to Lady Eastatia. She had told him that the heart he would have given so much to pos- sess, was irrevocably another's, and hatred for the fortunate rival was the principal feeling that burned within his bosom. All wondered that he had returned to the hall without Lady Eustatia, but as he was a stranger, and an earl, all forbore to question him respecting her. Without much difficulty he moved through the crowd of nobles and ladies, until he reached the king, who had been regarding him with much interest. "I would speak a moment in private with your majesty," whispered the earl, in the ear of king Henry. - The monarch turned to the Count de Valence, who stood beside him, and making known the wish of the earl, requested him to lead them to another and unoccupied room. In a few moments they found themselves in a large chamber furnished in a style of Oriental mag- nificence, through whose velvet curtained win- dow the rushing waters of the proud Thames could be distinctly seen. "Pardon me, noble king," began the earl of Gordon, in a bland, musical voice, "for thus requesting to speak alone with you, but-that of which I would speak,munst be heard by no ears save yours and my own." The king seemed amazed, and gave an earnest look at the handsome features of the earl, as if to read his' meaning there. Suddenly the' earl threw off the brown curling hair that fell over his neck and brow, and disclosed the raven locks and bold, haughty countenance of the Spaniard, Crescelle! "Crescelle!" exclaimed the king, both pleased and surprised, " can it be possible that you havethus deceived me  I couldneverhave penetrated your disguise, nor have I suspected it! And, by heavens, you have well played your part this evening with Lady Eustatia!"     "I felt sure you would never recognize me in the-the Earl of Gordon," laughed Crescelle; "but as to Lady Eustatia, why, I declared my love to her and she rejected me!" "You did?" "Yes. I led her out upon the balcony, and told her, how much I loved her, but she inform- ed me her heart was another's, and she could never love me. I pretended to be much dis- pleased at her refusal, though it was just what I'expected. She is very charming!" "And if you succeed, in that enterprise, she will soon be yours. Have you formed any plan for taking the Orient, yet?" "I have. And a most excellent one it is. My lieutenant was the author of it." And the buccaneer proceeded to unfold his   plan to the king, who pronounced it a most ex. cellent one, and gave it his approbation. "When will you be on shore again?" asked the king, as they were preparing to return to the hall. "As soon as the Orient is destroyed. When I do return, I will visi you in the disguise .of the Earl of Gordon and tell you of my success." We must be in the hall again soon, for the count will much wonder at our long absence." "Lead on--I am ready," said Crescelle, again resuming his disguise. In a few moments more the Earl of Gordon and the King of Eng- land stood in the splendid dancing-hall, and the former soon left the mansion, while his parting glance, full of triumph, was bent upon Lady Eustatia.   CHAPTER III. THE VICTORY, AND HER COMMANDER.    Away-no cloud is hovering over us, Freely now we'll stem the tide; Light is each heart, while full before us, Hope's beacon shines, to cheer and guide." B  RIGHTLY   ove/r the high blue hills arose the morning sun, and again his cheering beams awoke all sleeping nature into life. Sky and sea, vale and hill; animate and inanimate, were alike visited by his life-giving rays, and alike drew freshness and beauty from them. Each blue wave, as the fair beams fell upon it, was tinged with a golden radiance, and it glit- tered and sparkled beneath the cloudless sun like a diamond's brilliancy. Fair and beautiful is the scene, as if a gay fairy had spread her wings above it, and, in a playful mood, showered down a wealth of her brilliant light upon it, thus rendering it a place too bright for mortals. But it is only nature's loveliness, and sh has enveloped the sunny dell, the lonely plain, and the blue sea in a robe, of beauty. Gaze oceanward I Far in the distance, and scarcely visible on the shore, is a large, warlike ship, riding calmly upon the blue raves. She is a dark-hulled, fine-looking brig   antine, and seemingly well prepared for any en. counter, for she is filled with men and has a formidable, warlike appearance. It is the Victory--the vessel of the Spanish buccaneer, Crescelle. Walking the deck, and apparently deeply en- gaged in thought, was the commander, his dark, searching eyes lit up with an unusual fire, and his countenance betraying the lion spirit that burned within him. He was dressed in their peculiar costume, and appeared, in all respectes like a bold, daring, blood-thirsty buecaleer. His rich blue velvet waistcoat was beautifully embroidered with gold, wrought into curious and elegant devices, and well became his symmetri. eal form. A long rich cloak of dark crimson velvet hung carelesly upon his shoulders, and the beautiful embroidery of that showed that it must have been done, by one well-skilled in the art, and doubtless a fair-fingered lady. From his splendid cap drooped a graceful white plume, which the light breeze often caught and tossed playfully, and occasionally threw it into his face, , but he seemed too deeply engaged in thought to     notice. Around his waist was clasped a shining black belt, from which depended a pair of hand- somely mounted pistols, a glittering Arabian scimitar, and a Greek stiletto, while from the bosom of his waistcoat, protruded the jewelled hilt of a dagger. His fine raven locks fell grace- fully over his shoulders, and the light, fresh wind caught and twined them with the snow-white plume, forming a perfect contrast in color. As his clear, eagle eye scanned the cloudless sky, an expression, half of anxiety, half of impatience, rested upon his features for a moment, then passed away, leaving his countenance firm and haughty as before. Seated quietly conversing, in groups or cou- ples, were the crew of the Victory, a dark, fero- cious-looking set, as ever trod the deck of a vessel. Each was dressed like the captain, save the elegant plume and rich embroidery of the cloak and waistcoat. But their countenances differed much. The dark, mustachiod Spaniard and Italian, the fair-browed Norman, and many who had no peculiar characteristic by which their lineage could be ascertained, were there, and though they were a motley company, each differ- ing from the other in cast and style of counte. nance, still there rested upon the features of all, that same demon-like expression which betrays their character. [sEs =NoRAVINO.] Apart from their companions stood a couple of Spanish-looking old pirates, apparently con- versing of something which pertained to their captain, for, ever and anon, one would turn his head; and gaze fixedly at the buccaneer com- mander, as he slowly paced the deck, bilent and stern. A large, frightful sear upon the cheek of one, told that he was acquainted with the glittering steel, while the small, gleaming, watchful eyes of the other, betrayed the fierce spirit within. "What do you guess the captain's thinking about!" asked the one with the scarred cheek, turning to his companion with the- gleaming eyes. "I suspect," returned the other, in a voice so   low that the captain could not possibly have heard it, that he's laying plans for destroying the Orient." "The Orient!" exclaimed the other, with considerable surprise manifested in his tone, "why, Marito, you don't mean the French war. vessel, do you?" "Yes, I do," answered Marito, very posi- tively. "Why, fellow, what are you thinking of?" exclaimed the astonished old pirate. "Captain Crescelle would no more attempt to take that ship, than he would to capture the whole Eng. lish army. She's twice as large as our smart little Victory, though of course, our brigantine is much the fastest sailer, for I never yet saw a craft that could outsail her. But what do you mean,Iarito,'about the captain's trying to take this French war-vessel?" "I didn't say he was going to take her," an. swered the other, carelessly. "What did you say, then 1" "That I guessed he might be laying plans to destroy her," calmly replied Marito. "What can he wish to destroy her for?" "I don't know as he does, but I overheard a conversation between the captain and De Granee- Ion, which made me suspect that he intended to destroy the Orient." "Well, it's my opinion if he does," said the other, "that he'll get his own fingers burned in the enterprise, more than theirs." "Don't speak too loud, Caritan," said the cautious Marito," for the captain don't like to have us speak against any of his actions or sayings," and with these words he turned away, leaving his companion in deep thought. Still the captain silently paced the deck, un. heeding what was passing around him, and only looking up to sweep his eagle eye across the cloudless horizon. The sun rose brightly from his gaily colored morning couch, and when he reached the meridian, the Victory's deck pre. sented the same quiet appearance, as it had at morn. A dark frown gathered upon the cap tain's brow, as he surveyed the clear azure sky for the twentieth time, and gazing for a moment   at the groups of men who stood around, he ap- proached Marito, and quietly asked: "Where is De Grancelon?" "In the cabin," answered Marito, his gleam- ing eyes fixed upon the commander's counte- nance as he spoke. Crescelle evidently did not relish such close scrutiny, for turning hastily away, he muttered something respecting the im- pudence of Marito, and then descended into the cabin. Near a small, elegant table sat a man, apparently not more than twenty-five years of age, with a countenance eminently handsome As the captain entered, he raised his head, and his fine hazel eyes sparkled strangely as he re- turned his careless greeting. "De Grancelon," said Crescelle, throwing himself into a chair, and fixing his eyes upon his companion's handsome countenance, "I think we shall not be able to destroy-the Orient to- night." "Why not?" asked the young man, quickly. "It will be difficult to carry out our plan when the sky is so entirely cloudless as now," replied the captain, frowning as he spoke. "But, captain," said De Graneelon, "the heavens may not be as cloudless by midnight. And should it be, we can use some stratagem to foil their vigilance." "But our first plan is safest and most easily carried out," answered the captain; "and I know we cannot capture the Orient, for she is far more powerful than our little Victory, and the largest ship in the French' service. We must burn the Orient, De Grancelont?" "I know we must, captain," answered the other, quietly; "and the plan I proposed is both safe and judicious. You intended to adopt it, did you not?" "I did, De Grancelon," said the captain; and it is the plan I shall now adupt. But we must not attempt it in a night as cloudless as this promises to be." "Ah, captain!" cried De Grancelon, who had been gazing at the western sky very atten- tively for a few moments. '"See! that cloud is rising and enlarging! The Orient will not 2   be riding so calmly upon the waves when the sun rises on the morrow!" "You are right, De Grancelon," exclaimed Crescelle, his dark eye lighting up with pleas- ure; "we must be no longer idle. We must have all prepared for the safe execution of our plan. We shall witness an exciting scene to- night, De Granoelon!" "Ay, as exciting as the capture of a richly freighted merchantman. But we must turn our course to the French coast, and our thoughts to the destruction of the Orient." "You think Marito will be the right one to send on board the ship, do you?" "I do. He is brave and cunning, and will play the Frenchman to perfection." "And will enter into the spirit of the enter- prise?" "I think so." "Then he is the man." "You know his worth, captain." "Not so well as yourself. I have never test- od his cunning particularly, but know that he is brave and true as steel. You have tested his skill, for when I was on shore at Cape St. Vincent, he saved the ship by his coolness in the hour of danger, you told me when I return- ed. Though Marito may be both useful and skilful, still I always carried in my heart an unconquerable aversion to him." "Why, captain.?" "I scarcely know myself. But I can never meet the glance of his gleaming eyes without a few angry words rising to my lips, I can scarce- ly tell why." "You must endeavor to overcome this strange dislike, if possible, captain," said De Grance- ion, as they reached the deck. The Victory's deck now presented a scene of bustle and busy stir. Orders were given, and as guickly executed, and in a short time, the dashing, handsome brigantine was bounding gaily over, the waters in tte direction of the French coast. The crew perceived that some exciting enterprise was occupying the captain's mind, and also that he was much elated at the appearance of the cloud. The sun Fet in a     bank of dark clouds, and the stars gleamed fitfully in small patches of blue sky, though they gave but little light to the scene. "This is just such a night as I wished for," said Captain Crescelle, addressing De Grance- Ion, as they once more ascended from the cabin, and stood upon the deck. De Grancelon smiled, and was about to an- swer, when the loud shout of "Sail ho!" aroused then, and the captain quickly answered: "Where away?"    ?  "Towards the French coast, and not more than a league from us! It is the Orient!" "Are you sure?" "Perfectly, captain!" "Call Marito here," said the captain, ad- dreing De Grancelon. In a moment more, Marito appeared, and respectfully "addressing the commander, signified his willingness to perform whatever his captain should require. "Marito," commenced Creseelle, fixing his eagle eye upon the man who stood before him, as if to read his very thoughts, "that French vessel yonder I have sworn to destroy.  As it will be impossible for us to take her by force, we must use stratagem, and burn her.  I Lave a plan in my mind, and you must assist in car- rying it into effect." "I am ready, captain." "It must be done this very night." "You have bnly to command me." "Your readiness to obey my orders is com- mendable." "Name   the work, and  it shall soon be done." "You see the ship, do you not?" ' "Yes, falutly." "We must approach no nearer in the Victory,  as we, should be watched, and then our plan  would be worse than useless. ,First, you will" assume the dress, air, manner and dialect of a' Frenchman, and on board the Qrient you will 1 pass for one of their own country." -  "Am  I to go on board the Orient?" ",You are.  When you have dressed yonr- self in this costume, which De Grancelon will furuish you with, a boat will take you as near   to the Orient as possible without attracting at- tention, and then you will swim the remainder of the distance to the French vessel, the boat and crew immediately returning. You will make no noise until you reach the Orient, when you will call for help, as if drowning, and they will doubtless rescue you. When you are safe- ly on board, we will bear away towards the south, and appear as if departing. You will tell them you have been on board this vessel, which you willnform them is a Russian trader, bound to (Consanthople. You will tell them you had fall:n overboard, and the vessel was some dis- tance from you4 before you could call for help, and as she was fast receding, and it would be madness to attempt to overtake her by swim- ming, you had concluded to endeavor to save yourself -by reaching their ship, if possible, which seemed to be nearing instead of receding from you. You must tell the story in a candid and honest style, and speak in the French tongue, and they will be easily deceived. You will seem to be weak and exhausted, and they, suspecting nothing, will doubtless give you a berth and allow you to remain unmolested as long as you please. When all is silent, in your vicinity, you will very cautiously creep from your berth, and without exciting any suspicion, set the Orient on fire.  As you cannot take combustible materials with you, it will be ne- cessary for you to find them on board the ship, which I think you cando, if you use sufficient caution. They must not know their vessel is oa fire, until it has made sueh progress that it can- not be stayed, and therefore, to prevent the fail- ure of tfe plan, it must be set in several places, if you can do so without exposing yourself or exciting suspicion. In about half an hour we will send a boat as near to the Orient as possi- ble without being  noticed by them, and wait until you have set the fires, and are sure the ship oannot escape, when you Vsl jump over- board and we will take you into our boat, and then retire to a safe distance, and witness the success of our scheme." "Ald a capital one it is, Captain Creo. cell" '"   "I think it will succeed." "It cannot fail." "Then prepare yourself, immediately. De Grancelon will attend you to the cabin, and furnish you with the disguise which you will as- shme." Marito and De Grancelon descended to the cabin, and the captain impatiently paced the deck until they returned. He started as he looked up and saw a Frenchman, in appearnce, standing beside him, and not until the man sig- nified his readiness to obey his orders, did he recognize Marito. "By the black eagle, Marito, this is a brave disguise," exclaimed Crescelle," and I fear not but you can execute the scheme!" "I shall execute it, and faithfully, captain," replied the pirate, in a firm tone. "I believe you," said the commander, as Marito sprang into the boat, which contained three men beside himself. Silently and swiftly they moved on the surface of the trackless ocean, towards the doomed vessel, which, though in the most imminent danger, knew it not. "You've a hard task before you, Marito," said one of the men; " and I don't think you can go through it, and come back safe." 4"You need not fear for me, Rostone," an- awered Marito, smiling at the earnestness of his companion; "for you know I am fearless and   cautious, and rarely fail in whatever I under- take." "I know all that, but this is more dangerous business than even capturing merchantmen, I guess you'll believe." "Bat I fear not for its success," replied Mari- to, firmly, and gazing anxiously at the Orient, which could be plainly seeq, ,notwithstanding the darkness. On sped the boat, silently and cautiously, dver the blue waves. Suddenly it stopped, and Rostone, in a low voice, spoke: "Can you swim the remainder of the way, Marito?" "Easily," was the low, quick reply, and, in another moment he had bid his companions adieu, and was surrounded only by the ooean waves.  Thbosefp ed swiftly back to the brigantine, and the moon broke from a mass of dark clouds, and shed her fair light upon the waters, just as they reached it. OQrders were given to fill away and bear. to the south, rand in a few moments the handsome vessel was bounding on her course. All was now still as death on the deck of the Victory. The captain paced to and fro with folded arms, his thoughts dwelling upon the thrilling scene he was so soon to witness, and the splendid prize which was the promised re- ward of his deceitful villany.     CIIAPTER IV. THE ORIENT-A THRILLING SCENB.   "The wild shriek rises on the air, From those who're doomed to die, And, mingling with their last wild prayer, The war-shout rings on high!" MARITO  moved quickly and noiselessly through the dark waters, until he had nearly reached the Orient, which rode like a queen or the sea upon the waves. A man, ap. parently the sentinel, was slowly pacing the deck, and occasionally glancing at the cloudy sky, as if endeavoring to ascertain if a gale was about to come upon them. His eyes then fell upon the sea beneath him, and he observed Marito struggling in the waters just as the thrill- ing cry for help rose upon the air. He instant- ly caught up a long coil of rope which lay near him, and easting one end of it at the apparently drowning man, cried out:  "Catch that, and I'll rescue you! Courage, and in a moment more you shall be safe 4" Marito eagerly grasped it, and the man drew him towards the ship. As he stood dripping and seemingly much exhausted before his res- cuer, the sentinel's kind feelings were roused by the sight of one of his own countrymen, as 4   ' he supposed him to be, in such distress, and he kindly asked: '* How came you so near drowning, friend?" Marito, in a very honest and candid tone, related the story he had been instructed to by Crescelle, making several alterations and addi- tions as suited his fancy. The sentinel and two or three other guards listened very atten. tively to his explanation of the unceremonious manner in which he had come among them, and then offering a few words of consolation and sympathy, all retired to their respective posts leaving Marito and his rescuer alone upon the deck. "Can   you give me a berth for to-night, friend?" asked Marito, of the deck sentinel; ,'"I am weary and exhausted, and should be re- freshed by a few hours sleep." Suspecting nothing, the sentinel granted his request, and then left him, as he supposed, to enjoy the benefits of" nature's sweet restorer." He then returned to his post, and quietly paced the deck as before. Marito soon ascertained that all around him  were soundly sleeping, v   When all was still and silent, save the breath-' s ing of the sleepers, and the measured tread of T the sentinels, he rose cautiously, and throwing b about him an ample robe which he found near, n he noiselessly moved to the door of the cabin, g and unclosed it. At the other extremity of the i room was visible another door, which led to an inner cabin, but it was firmly locked, and Marid-  to concluded it was best not to endeavor to force t it. Ascertaining that be need not fear de- f tection there, he softly entered, and a half-utter-  ed exclamation of surprise escaped his lips as he ] gazed around.  The large, and well-shaped  cabin was furnished in a style of eastern mar, nificence, and, by the light of the moon which fell softly upon the gorgeous carpet, Marito could plainly see it all. The gay-covered oush- ions, yielding to the slightest pressure, the rich a elegant drapery, and the air of magnifi- cence which pervaded all, excited Athe wonder and surprise ofthe buccaneer. But he wonder- ed not as one who was not accustomed to dis- play and splendor, for in the pirate's mountain cave the spoils of all nations were gathered, and in point of costly magnificence and richness, no palace could vie with the rock-guarded home of the fearless buccaneer band.  But that the cabin of an armed vessel should be furnished in su. splendor, was indeed a puzzle to Marito. I' RBy the holy cross of St. Mary 1" muttered he, " it's too bad to destroy this beautiful craft. Now if we could but capture her In some man- ner, without harming her, it would be better than one long cruise in search of trading vessels But our captain thinks it will be impossible to take her without losing our own ship and half our men besides, and we all know he don't want to lose them. But I can inform  the French captain of this plot to destroy his ship, and save her and myself also I By the cross of St. Mary, I'm half tempted to do it!" As his mind was dwelling intently upon this subject, and he had half determined to tell to the eaptain of the Orient, his eye fell upon something which lay upon the carpeted floor, which glittered brightly in the moonbeams. He stooped, and taking it up, discovered it to be a   small dagger of the most elegant workmanship. The jewelled hilt fitted closely to the hand that held it, and the keen, glittering blade seemed made for an instrument of death. As Marito gazed upon it, all his pirate feelings rose again in his bosom. "What was I thinking of," he muttered, his houghts entirely changed by the appearance of the dagger, " to imagine they would pardon a follower of the dreaded buccaneer, Cresoelle, merely for informing them of one of his plots? I was a fool to think so! The Orient shall be destroyed if I can accomplish it!" With but little difficulty the materials for kindling a flame were found, and passing silent- ly from the cabin, Marito soon found a conve- nient place in which to begin his work of destruc- tion. The first fire was already kindled, and he \ felt that he must be quick and cautious. Has- tily gliding down into the lower portion of the ship, he found himself in total darkness, for there was no outer opening for the rays of the moon to enter. Another faintflame quickly lighted up the darkness, and seemed ready to commence its fearful work, and devour the no- ble and doomed ship. Marito felt sure this flame could not be discovered, until it had made such progress that the Orient could not be saved. Returning noiselessly to the place he Iad left, he was about to throw himself into the waters and swim for the boat, which he could faintly see in the distance, when a hand was laid heavi- r ly upon his shoulder, and a voice spoke authori- tatively : 3  "Look round, fellow, and tell me who you f are!" Marito answered not, but looking the sentinel, for such he was, full in his face, recognized one to whom he had related his story when first ' rescued from the waves. s "What are you here for?" demanded  the, o sentinel, recognizing Marito. I  At this instant, a sharp tongue of flame gleam- , ed up from the spot where Marito had set his e first fire, and then another, and another, shot a up before the sentinel's astonished eyes. Then     seeming-to comprehend all, he fixed his flashing eyes upon Marito, and exclaimed: "Villain! that is your work!" Marito knew that in another moment he should be incapable of defending himself, if he did not at once annihilate the man before him. He rais- ed the jewelled-hilted dagger, which he had brought from the cabin, and aimed a blow at his heart, but the sword of his antagonist was already raised, and ready for its death-fraught work.  The sword descended, and    slightly grazed the arm of Marito, who sprang aside, but the dagger, with unerring aim, was buried deep in the heart of its victim. In another moment, Marito was surrounded but by the ocean waters, and speedily nearing the boat, which lay silently waiting for him. For nearly half an hour after the boat which left Marito to swim his way to the Orient hadT- returned, the captain of the Victory paced the deok of his vessel, impatiently awaiting the sue- cess of his scheme. The moon now looked ( mildly down from the cloudy sky, and gave E light and life to the seene, while the stars t twinkled fitfully around her, and occasionally. 1 a dark cloud would obscure them all, leaving \ the blue sea and its heaving waves in a pall of a darkness. But not one word spoke the pirate x captain, until the boat which was to await the E coming of Marito put off from the ship.  Call- X ing to them to row back and take himself, he' hastily wrapped the rich crimson cloak around E him, and springing into the boat, ordered his t men to allow the ship to remain in nearly the a same position she now was, until they had returned. "Now row near as possible to the Orient, h my lads," said Captain Crescelle, as he seated d himself in the boat, and gazed in the direction of the French ship. Silently and quickly they c moved through the blue waters, each wonder- t ing if Marito would perform the hazardous and cc dangerous task assigned him, and come back to sr them, safe and unharmed. At length the dark, proud form of the Orient could be distinctly nc seen, as the clear light of the moon fell. once ot again upon the waters, brightening the silent sa   sg scene. As Crescelle gazed upon the noble ship, he half-wished he had endeavoreA to take her by force, even at the risk of his h ndsome brig- Id antine and his faithful men. But it little mat. At tered how she was destroyed, for the fair prize s- would be his were the Orient burnt or captured; d for had Ye not the word of a king that it should at be so? s  The boat moved slower, and at last stopped. it It would be dangerous for them to proceed far- y ther, as detection would then be sure. Crescelle It impatiently awaited the first appearance of a p flame, which would be a harbinger of the acoom- , plishment of his design. His men, anxious for , their companion's safety, were alike impatient, y and all eyes were strained to catch the first glimpse of a flame. h  Suddenly a  sharp, fiery flash was seen from itnA ship, and immediately after the tongue of eflane gleamed up, spreading   its light far out upon\the waters. Another flashed up, and its clear brilliancy caused the waves to glitter and sparkle as if the sun's, bright rays had fallen upon   them, and was giving them  a gem-like beauty. By the light, Creseelle could distinctly see the short, but fatal conflict with the sentinel, and Marito's immediate vengeance upon him for retarding his escape. He  saw his faithful mes- senger leap lightly into the water, and make his way to the boat. "He   is a faithful fellow, and my causeless 'hatred of him is now  entirely conquered," 'thought Crescelle, as Marito neared the boat and was received with joy by his companions. "Captain Crescelle," said Marito, as he once more stood by the side of his commander,   "I have performed what you requested, and yon- der ship will soon be but a mass of flame!" "And you have shown that your caution and cunning are equal to your bravery, Marito," said the buccaneer captain; his darkly handsome countenance lighting up with pleasure as he spoke. "6 And I   will exert them all to serve you, noble captain," said Marito; " and though all others desert you, and on whatever seas you sail, Marito, the pirate, will still be faithful,   and cling to the Victory and her rover com- Tl mander."                   he 4"By the black eagle!" exclaimed Crescelle, en his eyes gleaming with pleasure, "you have w; nobly spoken! But we will move to a safer *w distance from this burning ship, and then re- he main a short time and witness the scene."  bt The flames soon enveloped one side of the le vessel. The curses and imprecations of the in- tu censed crew against the one who had dared to fo set her on fire, mingled with the crackling of the timbers, as the devouring element curled and C hissed around them, and enveloped them in its D embrace. Orders were given, but the confusion n was so great that they were not obeyed, but n almost disregarded. When it became evident a that all attempts to save their ship would be fruitless, their rage was unbounded, and hastily tj lowering the boats they prepared to leave the b noble vessel forever.            S The Orient was now a sublime spectacle. e Each moment it was expected that the flames e Would reach the magazine, and all were prepar-  ing for the thunder-like crash which must cer- tainly follow. Around the tall, straight masts the red ,flames wound and curled, sending their , light far, far out upon the waters, and even illuming the distant shore. The pale moon's rays were no longer needed-for that gleaming, fire-laden ship, upon the dark blue waters, shed a more brilliant light than moon and stars could boast, in their moments of greatest brilliancy. Bar over the azuresheavens and the azure sea-, the distant shore, and the retreating boats-and the whole wide expanse for miles around, gleam- ed the bright flame of that burning ship. a wild, sublime, and fearful spectacle. Brilliant, sub- lime, and thrilling beyond description, was the scene, and as the buccaneer gazed upon it, he felt that he had never seen its equal. All, save the forward deck, was now in flames. But what is that which now appears upon the forward deck? It is a maiden I Her bare white arms were stretched forward, and her long dark hair floated wildly over her shoulders!   The threatening flames seemed ready to engulf her in their merciless bosom, and a death in their encircling arms or a grave in the ocean's cold waves seemed all that was left her, for the boats were fast receding. A wild, thrilling cry for help rose upon' the echoless night-air, and the buccaneer captain, who had been gazing speech- less with surprise, suddenly ordered his men to turn their course, and row with all their strength for the burning ship. "Pull, as if for your lives, men 1" shouted Crescelle, his whole nature excited; " see that maiden! As the light falls upon her counte- nance, see how superbly beautiful it i I We must save her I A moment's delay may forfeit all!" The maiden was indeed in a perilous situa- tion. The flames hissed and gleamed around her, and as their light fell upon her features, it showed them to be of surpassing beauty. Near- er and still nearer to' her came the destroying element, but the boat sped swiftly onward, and the maiden felt that hope was still left her. "Jump from the ship, and we will rescue you I Quick, if you would save your life!" shouted the excited Cresoelle, as they neared the ill fated ship. The maiden hesitated but a moment, then ! throwing her arms wildly forward, sprang into the waters. She sank beneath them, then rose, and shrieking, "Save me! save me 1"  sank again. Her thrilling voice and words went to d the hearts of the men, and they pulled with re- doubled vigor. , Once-once more-Land she is safe 1" ex- b. claimed the captain, and the next instant, as the e almost lifeless girl was sinking f9y the last time, ie he caught her by one of her outstretched arms, re and drew her into the boat. One look of grat- itude-"one smile that repaid him for his dan- he' ger, trembled upon her pallid lips, and she sank re insensible in his arms. ig  "Now pull for the Victory!" commanded s! Crescelle, " for your lives, men 1"     The light boat sped swiftly over the waters, and was soon safe from the burning ship.' Cres-: oelie gazed upon the fase of the maiden who lay insensible in his arms, and as he' wondered at her faultless loveliness, he asked himself the question, "Why was she on board the Orient?" The future pages of our story shall answer this inquiry. All wondered that the ship had not before 1 blown up, as she seemed completely enveloped I in flames. But it was the lighter parts that E had been consumed, and the devouring element fi had not yet reached the strongly-guarded maga. i zine. But danger-imminent and fearful, had; those daring men been in, in approaching so near;   the gleaming, crashing, threatening mass of flame. Just as they reached the brigantine, CreEcelle turned to gaze once more upon the burning ship. The flames blazed still brighter for a moment, then a wild, fearful flash illumined t6e6seene for miles around, and, an instant after, the deep, astounding crash that followed the explosion of the magazine, eehoed from the far-off hills. A strange darkness seemed unaccountably to have settled suddenly down upon the dark blue ocean, for that beacon-like light was gone-thse Orient was no more!   CHAPTER V. A VERY INTERESTING HSTORY, EXPLAINING THE BUCCANEER'S HATRED OF NORVILLE BLANCHFOlt), AS ALSO GIVING HS REASONS FOR PURSUING A PIRATICAL LIFE. "Thus memory, from her treasured urn   "Thus memory, from her treasured urn, Shakes o'er the mind her spring-like raini Thus scenes turn up and palely burn, Like night-lights in the ocean's train." N a very richly furnished apartment of the royal palace, sat the king of England, busi- ly engaged in perusing a closely-written man- uscript, evidently some state petition, which lay upon the elegant table by his side. Suddenly he pushed it from him, and leaning back in the softly cushioned-chair, gave up his mind to the thoughts that were passing within his bosom. He had been thus engaged but a few moments, when, a page interrupted him with the inform- ation that a courtier was without, who desired audience of the king. "Who is he, Maroon?" asked king Henry, abruptly rising from his chair, and adjusting his slightly disordered robes. "The Earl of Gordon, your majesty," an- swered the page, bowing with the grace of a courtier to his royal master as he spoke. The ,darkly brilliant eyes of the king glittered with a strange expression, as he heard the name the   Spanish buccaneer had agreed to assume, and he bade the page immediately usher in the visitor. An expression, half of fear, half of anx- iety, passed over the face of king Henry, as the page withdrew, but it quiokly disappeared, as he returned followed by the disguised bucca- neer. The page again immediately withdrew, and the king and thie Spaniard were left alone together. The latter threw off the rich cloak that concealed his form and features, 'sbook aside his dark curling hair, and bowing grae- fully to the king said, in a pleasant tone: "King Henry of England, we meet once more, and my promise has been fulfilled." "I know it, my faithful Crescelle," answered the king; "the news of the burning of theb Orient has rung through all London, and is the  theme of every tongue. It was a daring deed, and has disheartened the French more than any of their defeats " "Is it known by whom the deed was done?' "It is not, save that a handsome fast-sailing brigantine was seen hovering about the coast,     and it is supposed that it was set on fire by a man from her, who was picked up, half drowned, by the Orient." "The brigantine was my vessel, and the whole affair was planned by me, as you are al- ready aware. But it is useless to enter into de- tails. The Orient is destroyed-the coast of France is clear for you, and now I come to claim my reward--the beautiful and noble Lady Eustatia L'Elive!" A shadow passed over the handsome features of the'king. but quickly passed away, and with an effort at a smile, he replied: "The three weeks have not expired yet, Cap- &ain Creseelle." :"I know  it, your majesty," returned the buccaneer, quickly, " but cannot I claim my fair prize before that time has expired?" I "You can scarcely wish me to place her in your power before that time has passed. As the peerlessLady Euxtatia is now the reigning belle of London, should she disappear, much search would be made for her, not only by the proper authorities, but by her numerous friends and lovers; and her accepted lover, Captain Blanehford, would allow no place to remain un- searched ; I, as sovereign of England, would be expected to be the most forward in the search. You will perceive, Captain Crescelle, that I must not be suspected of aiding in the abduc- tion of Lady Eustatia, much less of consigning her into the hands of a buccaneer!" At I perceive that it would not be politic for a king to be suspected of aiding in the abduction of one of his subjects. But, your majesty, re- members the service I have done you?" "I do not forget it, Captain Crestolle. Your service shall be rewarded, and, if you still wish it, with the person of the peerless Lady Easta- tia L'EliVe." "My  love for the fair French maiden has not diminished, bat, if possible, it is still wilder and more uncontrollable than when I  knelt before her, an adoring worshipper of her peerless beau- ty. Bat there is another reason why I wibh to have the person of Lady Eustatia in my power- it is to thwart in love the one who has thwarted   me in honor, in ambition, and in power, and whose success has made me what I am-a law- less buccaneer." "You speak strangely, Captain Crescelle." "But I speak truly, your majesty. Have you leisure from your state cares and duties to listen to my past history '" "I have. As I am curious to know how Captain Blanchford ever could have injured you, I shall listen to you with the deepest in- terest and attention." For several moments the buccaneer captain seemed absorbed in deep thought, then raising his head, and shaking back the dark, clustering hair from his strikingly handsome countenance, he began: "' I was the only son of a Spanish noble, and as heir to one of the wealthiest titles and estates in Spain, I was so petted and flattered in early youth, that as I became older, I fancied that not even the king's son held so high a rank in the nation as myself. I could brook no res- traint-my proud spirit could bear no insult, be it ever so trifling, real or fancied. When I was but twenty years of age, I first appeared at the Spanish court. I was young, handsome, ambi- tious and very wealthy, and the king met me with decided favor, but which seemed nothing compared with the flattery and smiles of the ladies of the royal household. I attended court for nearly three years, without finding a maiden who could interest me for more than a passing thought, yet, at the end of that time, the king's daughter, the fair Princess Emilie, fascinated me by her beauty and vivacity, and I sued for her hand, by the permission of her royal father. But she treated my addresses with scorn, and my love, which at first had been but a transitory passion inspired by her fascinating beauty, soon turned to hate, mingled with a desire for revenge. But now a burning ambition took possession of my  soul-I saw a brilliant destiny in store for me, as high and powerful, as in my most wild moments I could have wished for. But to gain this height I must wed the Princess Emilie- the king's only daughter, and, as her hbsband, I should then be king of Spain! The glitter-   ing project dazzled my ambition, and, though I hated her, I resolved to wed her, if by that means I could gain a crown and throne. The king favored me--my blood was as noble as that which flowed in the veins of any of the royal court-I was young, handsome, and    very wealthy, and, in the king's mind, a fit suitor for his fair and noble daughter. I could not ac- count for the cold haughtiness and scorn. with which she treated me, but I renewed my efforts, to win a -smile, yet still without success. I should have scorned her, had she knelt at my feet and implored my forgiveness for her past conduct; but my ambition cheered me on-1-I saw the brilliant fortune in the future, and I would have iarificed all but life to have the wild dream realized. Baut I was soon to learn the cauee of the strange conduct of the Princess Emilie. t"It was a bright, clear moonlight night, that, in hopes of-finding something to divert my mind from the wild thoughts which filled it, I left the palace and entered the beautiful garden which was attached to the royal residence. I walked slowly among the beautiful trees and sweet- s,3ented flowers, when I suddenly heard the sound of voices, and, concealing myself in the shadow of a large, draperied statue, I listened. I started wildly as the Princess Emilie's voice fell upon my ear, but, controlling my feelings, I listened with intense interest. The voice of her companion was rich, deep, and thrilling, yet his tones were not of love-it was evident that he was not a lover of the royal maiden. -' Yes, Norville,' said the prinoess, in atone of passionate emotion, ' I love you. Though I know a maiden should never tell her love, un- asked, yet I must--I must tell you, Norville Blanchford, that my heart is yours, and only yours, forever. To-day, my father has been imploring me to wed the Duke d'Crescelle, but I firmly refused-he implored, he flattered, then he threatened me, but yet I firmly refused; I could bear even my royal father's anger, ay, I ,could bear even death, for you; Norville I' "It was with strange feelings that I listened to these words, from the woman to whom I had   knelt, and so passionately prayed to smile upon my love. I listened with breathless eagerness for the answer of her companion. "' Princess Emilie,' said he, calmly, 'you forget your dignity, as daughter of the king of Spain, when you thusimplore the love of one so far beneath you. I am but a nameless youth- forget me, fair princess, and it will be better for your own happiness, as I can never love you, or accept of your hand in marriage, The Duke d'Crescelle is your father's choice, and he is a noble of rank, wealth, and title-wed him, Lady Emilie, and forget me forever V' "I stepped lightly from the shadow of the Statue, and stood so that I could view them both, without their observing me. The young man was very handsome, yet I wondered that the prin- cess should have loved him, for he wore the plain dress of a Spanish peasant, and he could not have been more than nineteen years of ageo. Yet he was evidqently not of Spanish origin, for his countenance was fair and delicate, and his voice decidedly Englith. He stood calm and firm before the youthful princess, whose face wore an expression of despair and almost des- perate anguish. "' Norville Blanchford,' she said, endeavor-. ing to control her emotion, I when first I saw you in the hunrbloe ottage of a peasant, my beart told me that you alone was the one whom [ could love. You had been shipwrecked upon our coast-you were a stranger, without friends, ill, wounded, and with no nmeans to procure even a shelter. By mere chance I saw you. My heart was no longer my own. I had yousecret- ly removed to the palace.  I dres-ed your wounds, and I, yes, I, a royal princess, assumed the office of both nurse and physician, and under my care you have recovered. My father has seen you, and looks with favor upon you. The only reason why be so earnestly wishes me to wed the Duke d'Crescelle, is because he is an universal favorite with the courtiers, and his proud title gives him favor. But, Norville, I cannot wed him, for my heart is in your keep- ing. My father will consent to our union, when he knows how deeply I love you; he will appro-     cate your noble character, which will make y a far greater favorite than the Duke d'Crescelle. If, dear Norville, you will but consent, to-mor- row H will lead you to the foot of the throne, before my father, and tell him all--my love, my hopes and fears, and implore his consent to our union. He cannot refuse his only daughter what will make her happy forever, and we shall be crowned as king' Norville and queen Emilie, sovereigns of Spain!' "He hesitated. She observed it, and falling upon her knees at his feet, she clasped her hands and raised her eyes, the light of hope beaming through her tears, to his face. ' Nor- ville, Norville!' she continued, passionately; ' I, who never knelt to mortal man before, now kneel to you, and with all the earnestness of an almost broken heart, I pray, that in exchange for my undying, never-fading affection, my crown and throne, and my royal title, you give me your heart's first and truest love!' di Had the heart of Norville Blanchford been of stone, he could not have turned coldly away from this appeal. I saw that he was softened, that this had had the effect which the fair prin- cess doubtless hoped that it would, for a strange flush overspread his handsome countenance, and a softer light beamed from his eyes. The prin- cess saw it too-and springing to her feet, she threw her white arms about his neek, and pil- lowed her face, now halfconcealed by her rich flood of golden curls, upon his bosom. "  I knew that should the princess succeed in gaining the heart of Blanchford, my ambition could never be realized. The time had'corpe for me to act. I saw the arm of the young man was wound around the waist of the royal maiden, that his head was bent upon his bosom, and that his lips tenderly touched the forehead of the Princess Emilie. I sprang forward, fall before them. He released himself from her enolasping arms, and confronted me boldly with, , What doest thou here, intruder?' "' Icame for vengeancel' cried I, at the same time aiming at him a  blow with my sword But an enemy which I    hed not prepared for sprang forward, in the person of the Princess -.   i milie, and, as I lifted my sword, she buried a small dagger in my bosom, at the same time crying ' Now, villain, take thy death!' I fell insensible to the ground. , When I returned to consciousness, I was lying upon a couch in the royal palace, with an attendant bending over me, and a surgeon was examining my wound. He pronounced it very dangerous, and told me that it was almost a miracle that the dagger had not given me a wound that would have proved immediately fatal. For several days I lay at the point of death, being most of the time delirious. The king often visited me, but I never again saw the Princess Emilie alive. I recovered, but the king never looked upon me with favor again. He was cold and silent when in my presence, and, as the king no longer caressed me as his favorite, my -ummer friends, the courtiers, soon left me. "It was a soft, calm autumn evening that the king came to my room, and almost sternly bade me follow  him, telling me that he had come to lead me to his daughter. About six months had passed since the fatal evening when the princess had endeavored to take my life, and my wound had now become well healed, but I had not forgotten, nor could I forget, by whose hand it had been inflicted. The king led me into a splendidly-furnished, yet darkened and silent room, and drawing aside a heavy curtain, he bade me look. There, silent and motionless, and wrapped in her death-shroud, lay the Prin- cess Emilie, lovely even in death. I gazed upon the white brow, the long golden curls, the closed eyes, and the marble lips, and I forgot, for a  moment, that the white hands, now clasp. ed so silently on the motionless bosom, had ever attempted my life. Tears stood in my own eyes as I turned to the king and asked an ex- planation of the strange scene. "'You  know,' said he, sadly, 'that my daughter loved a   young Englishman without title or fortune, and for reasons unknown to me, he did not return her affection. I, myself, did not know this until last evening. when my daughter told me all, and a short time after died. She told me she had not seen Norville   Blanchford since that eventful evening, when she so fondly hoped that she had awakened the long sleeping affection in his bosom, and my poor Emilie has died of a broken heart. Leave me forever, Duke d'Crescelle, for your society is no longer pleasant to a bereaved and heart- broken father.' "I left the royal palace, never again to re- turn. My ambition had been crushed, and I was now perfectly -careless what became of myself. I fitted out a vessel, picked up a com- pany of reckless fellows from all parts of the   world, and, for nearly seven years, I have been the most noted pirate of the ocean that has re- cently been known. You know the remainder of my history-how, by an accident, I fell into your hands--how I promised to serve you to the best of my ability, if you would but spare me and my band. The name of the buccaneer Crescelle has sounded over land and sea- though few know, as you do now, that he is of noble lineage, and oan number even kings and princes among his ancestry."     CHAPTER VI. tdlE SYBri, AND BtaR POPREC---ITS IEFFECT.   t t!ar hOr not-her words to me Bring nDt a thrill of fear, Strainge though her prophecy may be, To me it is like air 5" A  8 the buccaneer finished* and remained silent, king Henry said i "Your history is indeed interesting, Captain Crescelle, and it was indeed a sad fate, that of the fair Princess tmilie." "It was, your majesty. Can you wonder that I now wish to thwart in love, the one who has thwarted me in my ambition, and but for whom I might now have possessed a crown and throne T' "By my halidem, no t!" returned the king qutlkly o * I see now that love is not the only thing for whith you wish to possess Lady tlas- tatia. If possible, I will endeavor to get the fair lady into your power, when we find a cage in which to secure the bright bird, so that she cannot possibly escape." "If she is onoe on board my veosel, your nmajesty, there will be no fear of detection. I will take her to my mountain cave on the eoast -of Spain, and no intelligence of her ean ever   ' again reach England. Many a fair lady have I taken to that rock-guarded cave, to beguile my weary hours with her smiles of loveliness, and when she pined for her home again, the un- erring dagger or the oeean'a dark 4aters have silenced her forever." Even king Henry shuddered slightly as the buccaneer spoke these words. For a momenfi he thought of ttLstatiat-ofhet youth, her lovea liness, and trusting confidence, and he half de, termined she should not meet with euch a fear ful fate. But he knew the buceaneer's power, h6 recollected his many resources for digui^e and revenge, and in a moment, he replied : -"You say that Lady Blstatia has told you her heart is another'a, do you not, Capfain Cresa uell T' ' On the evening which I attended the leree at the matiuon of the Count de Valence, I de, olared my love to the fair French maiden, and the told me she could never love me, as her ht-art wa- irrevocably another's. But that did not lessen my  determination to make her my bride, and as my rival is no other than Norvillt * 1   Blanceford, it will also gratify my long cherish- ed revenge." "But had you not rather Lady Eustatia would give you her heart also?" '"That cannot be, your majesty." "But would you wish it?" "Undoubtedly, your majesty." You know the residence of the sybil of the cliff, do you not '" 1"I do, your majesty." "' She can give you a potion, which, if you administer to Lady Eastatia, she will love you as deeply and passionately as the Princess Emilie could have loved Norville Blanchford. Lord Carasby, when he wooed the beautiful Countess Loyaline Carisbelle, met with a haugh- ty refusal from the proud lady, for she loved another. Lord Carasby, almost desperate, ap- plied to the sybil of the cliff, and she gave him a love potion, which she directed him to admin-, ister to Lady Loyaline.' He did so.  The haughtiness of the countess changed to the most passionate devotion, and Lord Carasby won and wedded her, and she 'now adorns his beautiful castle, and regards her husband with a love lit- tle short of idolatry. And the Viscount Mal- den, the Duke le Dampierre, and others, have administered the sybil's love potion to the fair ladies whom they loved, but who loved them not in return, and always with the same effect." "Does the sybil give these,potions to all who ask for them'?" asked the buccaneer, quickly. "She does not. And she' gives them to no one but those whose love is deep, true, and noble, and who loves the maiden for herself alone." The countenance of the buccaneer grew dark again. He knew his love for Eastatia had none of that noble sentiment for its basis, without which no man can love a maiden truly-admi- --rtion for her virtue and noble qualities. The ding watched his change of countenance with a half perceptible smile curling his fine lips. "You fear the sybil will not grant you the gift, do you not, Captain Crescelle?" said the king, in a slightly sareastic tone, as he marked the working of the Spaniard's dark features.   A shadow of displeasure flitted over the face of the buccaneer, but he replied: "I shall, at least, seek the Sybil of the cliff, and tell her my love for Eustatia L'Elive, and if it can be obtained bby ay means, I will ad- minister to the beautiful, French maiden the magic love-potion. If her love for me should be as strong -as was that of the Princess Emilie for Norville Blanchford, she will follow me wherever I will lead." "She will love you as deeply as mortal can love, if you but give her, with your own band, this magic potion. And all affection she has ever borne for any other will be gone forever." "It will gratify both my love and revenge, should I succeed. And now," continued the buccaneer, drawing the folds of the rich cloak around him, and again allowing his dark hair to half-conceal his features, "I must be again the Farl of Gordon. The spbil must not know me as any other. Though my true name and title is Duke Alverne d'Creseelle, and by my crew and nations in general, I am known as ' Captain Crescelle, the Spanish buccaneer,' still I can assume any disguise, and any- name." A few moments after, the Earl of Gordon had mounted his splendid jet-black steed, and was gallopping in the direction of the "* sybil's cliff," so termed, from  the fact that the residence of the strange sybil was situated upon its height. The king sat alone in his royal apartment, mus- ing upon what had just passed. A shade of deep thought was upon his handsome, yet sen- sual features, and ocoasionally his lips moved, and his thoughts were expressed audibly: "* Yes," he -murmured, "the daring, reckless buccaneer yet thinks to win the love of Euota- tia L'Elive. But I would not fear to swear by my crown and throne, that the sybil will never give him the magic love-potion. , She knows too much of. the past, the present and the fu. ture, to give the love of the noble Lady Eustaw tia to a heartless buccaneer. By'my balidom, the count's fair niece is indeed beautiful I How splendidly a crown would sit upon her almost royal brow I Could she not be prevailed upon to be   queen of England, had king Henry     Eighth no consort? Yes, and as my marriage with Catharine is not strictly lawful, a divorce might be procured. She has lost the beauty and vivacity of youth, while Eastatia is the most beautiful maiden that ever trod the soil of Eng, land, and the suns of not more than twenty summers have shone upon her regal brow. But then she is French  Though that does not lessen my esteem   for her, yet my subjects would think it strange that their sovereign should wed a maiden of the nation to whom we are deadly foes. Yet I am king of England, ,--^t4d am not answerable' to my people for my ac- tions in choosing a queen. She is beautiful-- this French girl I And her lineage is unques- tionably noble, and some have even asserted that royal blood flows in her veins. I will pro- cure a divorce from Catharinef and this beauti- ful French girl shall be the bride of Henry Eighth, and her title, Queen Eastatia, of Eog- land!" "The Duke of Gloucester desires audience of your majesty," said a page, as he appeared and bowed gracefully to the monarch. King Hen- ry arose to ascertain the business of the noble- man, but he by no means forgot the interesting subject that had been passing in his mind. We will now return to the buccaneer Cres- celle, whom, for the time being, we will desig. nate by his assumed title--the Earl of Gordon. As his beautiful steed walked slowly up the Steep path which led to the sybil's dwelling. he thought of his first meeting with Lady Eastatia "Elive-of the singular manner in which he had   ascertained her residence, and how her brilliant beauty had really fascinated him moie than any   other maiden had ever yet done. There is but little doubt that he loved Eustatia, ( as deeply as his nature was capable of loving, and that he sincerely hoped to blind the eyes of 1 the sybil to his true character in such a man- I her as to induce her to furnish him with the I desired love-potion. He alighted  from  his  handsome charger at the door cf the sybil's cot. I iage, and scouring it to a tree, he gazed around' I him for a  few moments, before entering. The i  awend was iadeed pectaresque and beautiful. b   e The cottage stood upon the highest point of the e' cliff, and, from this height of the eminence a d scene was visible, which, for beauty and BlE It limity, was seldom equalled. Just far enough  in the distance to appear calmly and exquisite- y ly beautiful, lay the city of London, the clear t sun now gilding its many towers, spires, and t turres, with the brilliancy of gold. The calmn 9 blue bosom of the Thames, mirroring the cloud- i less sky, lay like a sheet of silvery azure beneath i it, and the skiffs, boats, and crafts of all doe , scriptions, dotting the beautiful river, seeme i  like so many fairy vessels at the distance where stood the admiring earl, his dark eyes sparkling - with unconcealed pleasure. The calm, deep beauty of the scene gave a peculiar softness to the'expression of the buccaneer's usually dark, yet handsome features, and, as he entered the sybil's cottage, no one would have thought him the black hearted, crime-stamped buccaneer of the ocean, which, in his less calm moments, he in reality was.  But he could not deceive the sybil-she knew  too much of human nature for that I The appearance of the sybil of the cliff was indeed strange, mystical, and calculated to inf spire wonder and fear, and most truly did shs seem the strange being she had been represented 'to be. Her hair, long, gray, and abundant, was half-concealed by the dark purple turban, or mantle, which was wound around her head, and extended almost to her feet. Her com- plexion was very dark, and though her features were regular, their aspect was mysterious ani forbidding. The expression of her countenance was by no means improved by two long. pointed, pearl-white teeth, which protruded over her un- der lip, giving her an almost frightful aspect, Her large, searching black eyes gleamed out from beneath overhanging brows, that had once been of a jetty hue, but were now mingled with gray. Her lips, though finely out and proudly curved, were so distorted by those almost hbyena- like teem, as to render their appearance far from pleasant. As she fixed her almost soulsearch- ing eyes upon the buccaneer as she questioned him respecting his errand, a half sareastic smile   ourled her lips, and her black eyes sparkled still more strangely, as she listened to his an swer. "I come, sybil of the cliff," coolly said th earl, standing proud and erect before' the stern gaze of the strange sorceress; "' I come, to ask of thee a boon, and; if you grant it, my happi- ness will be complete. In the proud city of London dwells a fair and noble maiden, who has bound my heart in a chain which I cannot break, by her surpassing beauty and goodness., but she has not given me her heart in, return. My life and happiness depend upon her love, ,and if it cannot be'given me then I am most truly miserable. You, good sybil, possess the :power to cause her to love me, as deeply as mortal could wish, and I came to ask of you this love-potion." The eyes of the sybil were fixed upon the earl with a  piercing gaze, as if she would read his very soul. It was some moments before she an- swered, and then her voice was deeply impres- sive, as she slowly asked : "Dost thou love the maiden nobly and truly, with thy whole heart ]" "My heart is hers forever," returned the' ,eu, "and my love for her is a pure and un- dying passion, inspired by her goodness, noble- ness and beauty." "Beware!" said the strange woman, her voice now more deeply impressive than ever;. "beware, Captain Crescele, how you come to the sybil of the cliff, with a falsehood like that' upon your perjured lips 1" The disguised buccaneer started and became deadly pale as she spoke these words. It was ivident  that she had penetrated his disguise, and that his name was well-known to her, and doubtless his true hasacter and profession. He could not answer her. / "Dare you deny it'? continued the sybil, ] advancing nearer to her astonished companion; "dare you deny that what I have spoken is true? That you come, hoping to blind me, the power- 1 fei sybil, by a simple love tale?' And do you  ask  for my  aid in furthering your infernal i iehevae? But I know too much df the past andt    present, and can look too far into the dim, shadowy future, to give the strange potion to such as thee! I know, false buccaneer, too much of life and death, of hope and sorrow, and too much of thee, to grant what thou hast asked of me!" "Jest not with me, proud sybil," said the earl, endeavoring to shake off his surprise and fear of the strange being before him, and hoping yet to succeed in deceiving her, " think not to J intimidate me by your false words, or hope to induce me to believe that you have a super- natural power over the actions of men, or that you know more than other mortals of the un- seen future. Give me the magic love-potion, and it is all I ask." "And it is far more than thou shaltreoeive t" said the sybil, scornfully. "I must possess it, sorceress!" "Thou canst not!" "But the maiden-she must love me!" "Methinks if thou wert noble and true, she would love thee of her own free will," said the sybil. The earl was silent. I "Who is this maiden?" pursued the sor- ceress. "should not the sybil of the cliff know with- out asking?" scornfully said the earl. "She does know, villain!" "Then  speak her name,   sybil, if thou canst!" "Elstatia L'Elive!" The earl started. He could not but believe that the sybil knew all. A darker frown over- spread his handsome features, and the sorceress continued : "Yes, Captain Crescelle, thou  cruel and heartless buccaneer, I know all that thou canst say. Think you that the sybil of the cliff knows not that king Henry of England negotiated with the Spanish pirate for the destruction of his enemy's powerful vessel, the Orient, and, in re- turn, he promised that the young and beautiful Eustatia L'Elive should be placed in his infer- nal power? Think you that the sybil knows Rot thim?  But beware, Alveme  d'Creseellw     that you harm not the French maiden, for the sybil of the cliff may yet be her avenger!" The eyes of Crescelle flashed fire. His lion spirit was aroused, and drawing his dagger from his bosom, he sprang towards the sybil. "You have spoken what shall cause your death!" he cried, fiercely. II Your know- ledge of the past, the present, or the future, shall not save you now!" He raised the glittering weapon, and the rays of the sun fashed gaily upon it as it descended, but the sybil had sprang aside. "Hold, Alverne d'Creseelle!" she cried, in a voice of *fearless command. "But lay your hand in violence upon the sybil of the cliff, and your life is no longer your own I As you value it, beware!" The fearful voice in which the last words were spoken, told the buccaneer that it would be the best policy for him to desist from his purpose, and he dropped the glittering dagger. "And," continued the sybil, raising her right arm, and pointing with her finger upward, while her almost fearful eyes flashed like those of an angry tigress, "I have but one more thing to say to thee, and as thou valuest thy life, forget not what I speak, for the sybil never prophe. sies in vain. - If, still persisting in your villa- nous project, you succeed in getting Eastatia   "Elive into your power, ere four .more weeks have passed, you shall die by her own hand!" As Crescelle gazed upon the prophetess, he felt a fear such as he had never before known. And well he might have feared her. Her tall, proud form was drawn up to its utmost height, and the dark mantle hid fallen from her white, upraised arm, while the long, menacing finger i was pointed prophetically upward. Her black eyes flashed with intense excitement, and her proud lips were curved with a scornful smile. ' Her majestic mien, the prophetic finger, the impressive voice, -and ferul words, all bad their effect upon the buccaneer, and turning from her, he rushed from the cottage. Half an hour after, he reined up his foaming steed by the side of the blue Thames, and gazed thoughtfully down into the azure waters. He could not forget that fearful prophecy, and, for a moment, his project respecting Eustatia was almost abandoned. "But no-no!" he muttered, his buccaneer spirit again returning; "Lady Eastatia shall be mine!  The spell is past-I am no longer a coward, and this woman's power shall no longer have an influence over an ocean buccaneer I I am again myself--and that strange spellis put--- I scorn the sybil' prophee y 1"   CHAPTER YII. TIE YOUNG STBANE---TEIB MOUNTAIN RENDEZVOUS--THo CAPTIVE.   "Pray thee, maiden, hear him not I Take the warning by my lot; Read my scroll, and mark thou all I can tell thee of thy thrall!" 'HE proud countenance of the buccaneer A  had again resumed its wonted expression, and the strange fear he had felt of the sybil and her prophecy, had now entirely subsided., He was about to remount his horse and leave the spot, when his attention was attracted by the appearance of a young man (or rather boy, for he could not have seen more than sixteen summers), mounted upon a handsome horse, and who was leisurely riding in the direction of London. As he approached nearer, Cresoeele perceived that there was a sealed letter stuck in the belt of the young stranger, and his curi- osity was at once atused in respect to it. As the young man passe-Ikhe buccaneer, and sup. posing his dress, which was that of an earl, be- Bpoke his rank to be the same, he bowed defer- entially, and with a pleasant "Good morning," was passing on, when the letter, which had been but loosely stuck in the belt, fell to the ground. Crescelle stooped, and picking it up, glanced at   the superscription, which was written in a hand- some, manly hand, '"Lady Eustatiai L'Elive." "Ay," he muttered, " it is from Blanchford! My eyes must view it ere her bright orbs devour its contents I It may aid me in my plot!" Then turning to the boy, he continued, aloud: "As I see this letter is directed to Lady Eus- tatia L'Elive, and I am now bound to the man- sion of the Count de tValence, I can carry the letter, thus perhaps saving you some inoonve- nience." The tone of the speaker pleased the young stranger, and with a smile, he assented to the villain's proposal, thou turning his horse's head, was soon riding away, having first been assured by Creseelle, that the letter should be safely placed in the hands of Lady Eastatia L'Eive. The buccaneer mounted his beautiful steed, and rode leisurely on in the direction of London. He soon drew from his bosom his sharp-pointed dagger, and carefully separated the seal of the letter.  He then opened it, and read aa follows: "DsAaBT    EusTAT :--As I  have some. thing very important to oommunicate to you, I     wish you to meet me, at the hour of nine this evening, at the beach where my vessel, the Conqueror, is anchored, taking in men and stores. I would meet you at the mansion, but we fear the French frigate Alcena is not far dis- tant, and I cannot leave my vessel, yet I must see you. All will be quiet at nine, and if you dress so that you will not be known, you need fear nothing. The countersign for to-night is ' Sovereign.' Do not fail to meet me, dearest Eustatia, for I have much of importance to say to thee.  Thine forever,  NORVILLE." "Just the thing," muttered the buccaneer captain, while a smile, like that of a demon of the infernal regions, passed over his dark coun- tenance. , He glanced once more over the #and- somely written note, then refolded it, and again fastened the seal. "Ah, fair Lady Eustatia," he muttered, the ,demoniac smile again passing over his dark, yet strangely handsome features, "thou wilt not meet thy lover to-night, however fondly thou mayst anticipate the meeting  I must not forgeot the countersign-for it will serve me much in the execution of this plot. Young; beautiful, noble and accomplished, what wonder that Nor- ville Blanchford seeks to win the belle of Lon- don, EuBtatia L'Elive!" For several moments the captain resolved in his mind the circumstances now so favorable to his wishes, and his plans for securing his beau- tiful victim were soon laid. Suddenly giving his horse the spur, he rode rapidly on towards London, and soon drew up his foaming charger before the elegant mansion of the Count de, Valence. "Hand this note to your mistress immediate- ly," said he, addressing a servant, at the amna time giving him the sealed billet. The man obeyed, and once more turning his horse's head, the Earl of Gordon rode rapidly away from the mansion. After following the main road for some time, and until he had  reached a rather desolate and unfrequented part of it, he sud- denly turned his horse into a narrow foot-path, Which was evidently but seldom trod, yet which   3 the buccaneer seemed to be well acquainted with. For two hours he spurred on the foam- ing charger, over an almost impassable path, sometimes leaping over huge pointed rocks, or dashing through a vine-knotted thicket, or pass- ing slowly through a deep, yet narrow river. At last he .drew up his high-mettled steed be- fore a small, rudely-constructed hut in a wild, unfrequented spot, and leaped quickly from the saddle. A youth, dressed in the dashing cosa tume of the buccaneer band, emerged from the hut, and stood awaiting the captain's orders. "Take the saddle and bridle from this animal, and allow him to refresh himself as he pleases, but watch him that he does not go out of sight, for I may want hi. again within half an hour," said, Crescelle, giving the rein to the youth. He then entered the hut, where sat two men, before a rudely-constructed table, and calling one of them to him, he said in a low voice: '"De Grancelon, we must leave this rendez- vous to-night, for ere the bell of London tolls the hour of midnight, Lady Eustatia will be in my power i" "Impossible, captain!" exclaimed De Grance- Ion, considerably surprised. "Quite possible, De Grancelon," returned Creseolle, while again that demon-like smile passed over his dark features. He then related to his companion the result of his interview with the king, his visit to the sybil, her prophecy, 'the manner in which he had come into possession of Blanchford's letter to his lady-love, its con- tents, and his immediate return to the rendez. vons. De Grancelon congratulated his captain upon the success of his visit to the city, and Crescelle continued: "I shall immediately return to London, and as soon as night sets in, you will follow the path, with a  horse for yourself, and also one for Lady Eustatia. You will conceal yourself and the horses near the spot, where the foot-path opens into the main road, remembering to be well- armed, and take the swiftest horses that can be found. When I call your name, you will make your appearance with the animals, and, after placing our fair captive upon one, we will re   turn to this rendezvous, where Rostone will be' waiting with fresh horses. It will then take us but a short time, with hard riding, to reach the secret cove where the Victory is anchored, and then we need fear nothing, for on our own ele- ment we are invincible. Conrad must be sent to the vessel to inform them that we shall leave sometime during the night, and direct them to be ready at a moment's warning. Before anoth- er sun rises over London, its fairest maiden will be a captive, and long before her despicable lover, Blanchford, can have traced her out, she will be a buccaneer's bride!" "I wish you joy, Captain Crescelle," re- turned De Grancelon, pleasantly, "but what will you do with the oharmior maiden you res- cued from the ill-fated Orient?" "Give her to you, for your faithfulness in my cause, De G(rancelon," laughed the-captain; "but she is to Lady Eustatia, only what the stars are to the queen of night." 4 Then the belle of London must indeed be surpassingly beautiful,"  returned the young man, warmly. "She is indeed, De G(rancelon. But I must be away, for I would not have the fair prize slip my fingers on any account. You will inform Rostone of the part he is to act in the affair, and direct him to be ready with the horses. I will give Conrad his orders, myself. You will not fail to blready with the animals, and well-armed at nine precisely." "I will obey  you in every particular, Cap- tain Crescelle," returned De Grancelon, whose thoughts were full of the beautiful maiden who had been rescued from the Orient, on the fear- ful night of its destruction. The captain, after a few more'unimportant words, left the hut, and again mounting his horse, which the youth, Conrad, led up to his side, he said: 'Conrad, you   will immediately go to the secret cove, where the Victory is anchored, and tell Marito, who, you know, is captain in my absence, that we shall come on board by mid-   night, and that he must be ready to set sail at an instant's warning. You need not return, as De Grancelon and RIoston6 will be sufficient to carry out my designs here." "I obey you, noble captain," said the youth, bowing servilely, as he handed the buccaneer the bridle rein, who immediately turning his horse's head, he gallopped away, over the rocky path, in the direction of London. Night had again thrown her sable mantle over the proud and stirring city, and hushed it- into a calmer silence, which, though often broken by the sound of gaiety and revelry, formeda' pleas- ant contrast to,-the bustle and confusion of the day. The heavens were covered with light, floating clouds, which, though not sufficient to render the evening a gloomy one, occasionally obscured the moon, and  rendered the light of the stars so faint as to be almost useless. It was nearly the hour of nine, when a dark figure, closely muffled in an ample cloak, whose folds entirely concealed both face and person, emerged from the door of the mansion of the Count de Valence, and mounted a beautiful jet-black steed, which stood waiting at the foot of the mansion steps. The servant, who held the horse's rein, whispered, as he gave it into the delicate gloved hand of the rider, a" be care- ful of yourself, sweet lady, and return as soon as possible," in an earnest voice, which betrayed his anxiety for the .safety of his mistress. The spirited horse at this moment suddenly reared, as if affrighted at something, and in attempting to curb it, the cloak fell from the shoulders of the rider. As the moon, which had just emerg- ed from a cloud, fell full upon the features, it disclosed the surpassingly beautiful countenance of our fair young heroine, Eustatia L'Elive. The spirited animal was soon curbed by the servant, and again stood still, awaiting the pleasure of its rider. "A  rather bad beginning, sweet lady," said the servant, as he assisted the fair rider again to replace the dark cloak, so as effectually to con- ceal her features. This was soon effected, and     with another word of caution, he gave her the rein, and she rode away at a brisk pace from the mansion. The servant watched her until she was out of sight, then, with a strange feel- ing of misgiving at his heart, he entered the mansion. 4 The count would be displeased if he knew his fair niece had gone to meet her lover, at this time, and alone," he muttered, half angry with himself for not having accompanied her, even against her will, for the Lady Eustatia was a brave young girl, and had determined to meet her lover alone, at all hazards; yet the faithful servant half wished he had followed his fair young mistress, for he feared, he knew not why, that some danger was menacing her. How far his fears were to be realized, we shall soon see. Our fair heroine rode briskly on, in the direc- tion of that part of the Thames where the noble war-vessel of her lover, the Conqueror, was then anchored. As she passed the sentinels, she gave the countersign, "Sovereign," in a firm, clear voice, and was allowed to pass without farther questioning. She soon reached the bor- ders of the city, and the road became more des- olate and unfrequented, the dwellings being few and far between. Our readers must bear in mind that the scenes of our plot are laid in the first half of the 16th century, when the environs of London were not, as now, beautified with those elegant suburban estates, which are the pride of their owners and the admiration of all; but that without the borders of the city, the wilderness of nature was in many places un- broken, save by the dreary main road which passed through it. But, to our heroine, the dangers which attended her undertaking, were unthought of, when a meeting with her lover was the reward of her courage and intrepidity. She had now reached the most dangerous portion of the road. The moon, now obscured by a dark cloud, gave but little light to brighten the gloomy scene, and E lstatia, half fearful that evil was near, grasped the hilt of her dagger firmly with one hand, while with the other she   guided her faithful steed., She approached the spot where the footpath branched off from the main road, and as she neared it, the sound of a horse's footstep aroused her, and her faithful animal, seemingly consoious that his mistress was in danger, suddenly dashed forward, when a tall, powerful figure stepped from the shadow of the trees, and catching the bridle rein, held it firmly. The spirited animal reared his head furiously, and endeavored to shake off the vil- lain's hold, but in vain. Eustatia, not losing her presence of mind even in this trying moment, drew her dagger, and bending forward, aimed it at the heart of the villanous stranger. But, while he still held the bridle rein with his right hand, with his left he grasped the arm of Eus- tatia, and forced her to relinquish the weapon from her grasp. "For what purpose is this outrage, villain?" cried the spirited maiden, endeavoring to regain possession of her horse's rein. "You are totally in my power, fair lady," returned the stranger, "and be assured I shall not let you escape so easily. I hardly think you will meet Norville Blanchford to-night, ha, ha, ha!" Euastatia was astounded. What could all this mean? and where would it end? were questions that passed rapidly through her brain, but which she found herself unable to' answer. The stranger, who still grasped her horse's rn, now placed a small silver call to his lips, an as its shrill note echoed through the forest, the sound of horse's feet was again heard, and a man ap- peared, mounted upon one superb animal and leading another. "I think we shall not need the horse you bring, as you see our fair captive is well pro- vided," said the first stranger, in whom the reader doubtless recognizes Captain Crescelle, addressing the new-comer. "But," he con- tinued, " we will take the animal back with us, as, if an accident should happen, it may be need- ed. Florian!" As he pronounced the last word in a higher   key than he had hitherto spoken, the favorite charger of the captain stepped from the shadow of the trees, and giving an answering neigh, ap- proached its master. "Ah, Florian," said the captain, as he sprang into the saddle, " we have a long ride before us, and you must show yourself a noble animal, as you have hitherto done.. And you, fair lady," said he, turning to Eustatia, and still grasping her bridle rein, " you will please to go with us, and the less noise and trouble you make, the better you will be treated." "I shall not submit to be ordered or control- led by you, villain that you are!" exclaimed the proud-spirited maiden, her eyes flashing with anger. "You will not, eh?" returned the buccaneer, springing from his saddle. "De Grancelon, we shall be obliged to bind our pretty captive." In a few moments our heroine's hands were tightly bound behind her, and a close bandage placed over her mouth. Unable to offer any resistance, she was obliged to suffer herself to be entirely at their mercy. Crescelle, leading the horse of his fair captive, first entered the narrow pathway, while De Grancelon followed with the two other horses. For nearly an hour they rode on in silence, it seeming to Eustatia as if she could not survive the tightness of the bandage placed over her mouth, as it was almost impos- sible to breathe. "Will you be civil, my pretty lady, if I will free your mouth and hands?" asked the buc- caneer, addressing his almost suffocating cap- tive. She could only reply by bowing her head, and in a few moments the bandage was removed from her mouth, and the cords taken from her wrists. Eustatia almost forgot her situation in once more breathing the fresh, pure air, and the pleasure she experienced was almost indefinable. The path now became narrower and more dangerous, and it was impossible for two horses to walk abreast. Creselle now gave his fair captive the rein of her horse, and leading the way him-   ' self, he placed her just behind, while De Grancel. loi brought up the rear. The riderless horse, knowing the path, followed them a short dis- tance behind. "She cannot escape," thought the buccaneer, "for at the slightest deviation from the pith, De Grancelon will be ready to give me warning. And in this wild, rocky region, entirely unknown to her, she will not attempt it." But the dauntless maiden thought otherwise. Brave as she was beautiful, and trusting for safety, if she once escaped, to the speed of her swift charger, she was now eagerly watehing for an opportunity to flee from her heartless cap- tors. She had already recognized the voice of the Earl of Gordon, and, fearing the worst,'if she still remained in his power, she determined to make her escape if possible. The favorable moment had come. De Grance- lon, not suspecting the design of their captive, had fallen into a pleasant reverie, in which the fair maiden rescued from the Orient formed the principal attraction. Crescelle rode leisurely on, often turning to look at his fair captive, but not even suspecting what was passing in her mind. Giving her intelligent qharger the word of command in a low voice, she sprang aside, and leaping over a huge rock, was out of sight before her captors had recovered from their surprise. "On-on-we must retake her, De Granee- lon!" cried Crescelle, springing after her. Do Granoelon followed his example, and the splen- did steeds dashed on over the huge rocks, with the speed of the wind. Crescelle could just dis- tinguish the form of the maiden, and spurring on his swift charger, he bounded on after her, each moment gaining upon the less powerful, though more willing charger of his escaped cap- tive. The race was life or death. So thought Eds- tatia, as on flew her faithful horse, over the un- even, rocky ground. She knew not whither she was fleeing, and cared not, if she could but be safefrom the power of her merciless captors.     But now she heard the approaching steps of her purser's horse, and, if possible, her own animal flew on still faster. The steps grew nearer and louder-the hope which had been raised in the bosom of Eustatia, grew still fainter. But her onward course was suddenly stopped-her faith- ful charger, no longer able to bear the wonder- ful exertion neoessary to such terrible speed, fell dead to the ground, throwing his stunned and almost breathless rider some distance from him upon the rocky ground I She was soon again a captive! The riderless   horse, which had followed them in the rapid pursuit, now found a rider in the person of the hopeless Lady Eustatia. With some difficulty they again found the path, and soon reached the hut, where Rostone was waiting with fresh horses. After a brisk ride of another hour, dur- ing which time the fair captive was closely watch- ed to prevent another attempt to escape, they reached the Victory, and before the sun gilded the towers of London, they were far away on- the free blue ocean, bounding over the waves towards the coast of Spain,   CHAPTER VIII. EUSTATIA ON BOARD THE PIRATE VESSEL-AMNA DE LOUVESTEIN-HER HSTORY.   "And even when the' storms of Fate Come darkening o'er the stars of life, We backward turn to renovate Our thoughts with freshness, and create An antidote to strife." E must now take our readers to the northern shore of Spain, for there the thread of our story carries us. Two weeks have elapsed since our fair young heroine was taken from the shores of '* Merrie England," a hopeless and sad-hearted captive, and during most of that time, the Victory had been bound- ing over the waters, on her way to the pirate's mountain cave, on the shore of Spain. During this time, the young captive had been treated with the utmost kindness, and, save the desire to be once more free, she had not a wish ungrat- ified. She was-allowed- to roam over any part of the vessel, at any time she chose, and being an enthusiastic admirer of life upon the ocean, she did, at times, enjoy her situation. That most beautiful of all earthly scenes, moonlight upon the sparkling, azure ocean, almost enchant- ed the romantic, imaginative Eustatia, and she frankly declared to the delighted captain, that   she had never seen aught on land or sea before, so supremely beautiful. Not until she had been several days on board their vessel, was she aware that her captors were a band of lawless pirates, and probably would not have known it for some time longer, had they not fell in with a richly-freighted trading vessel from the Indies, and after a short, but severe conflict, captured her. They then took from their prize her rich and costly freight, transferred it to their own vessel, and then blew up the trader, and the whole of her remaining crew, which had been spared from the slaughter of the capture, were placed on board their ill- fated .vessel, and met with a terrible death by the feaful explosion. This threw a shade over the spirits of Eustatia, and half-suspecting all, she one day asked for an explanation. The captain frankly told her the truth-that he was the dreaded buccaneer Cresoelle, whose name had resounded over all Europe, and caused even kings and  princes to tremble-that he had knelt by her side in the disguise of the Earl of Gordon, and received a refusal, that he had deo     termined to possess her, at all hazards, and that she was even now on her way to his mountain cave in Spain, to become a buccaneer's bride! The Cantabrian Mountains, which run the whole length of the northern sea-coast of Spain, are a rocky, lofty range, and it was one of their large, winding, rock-guarded caves, that formed the principal rendezvous of the pirate band. Nature, in her strange sublimity, had made it, originally, an excellent retreat for the lawless band, but art, -with cunning hand, had so far improved it, that it was impossible to capture one who knew its secret recesses, after he had once entered it. Every one of the buccaneer band were well acquainted with all its secret rooms, trap-doors, and recesses, and could secrete themselves, in an instant's warning, from any foe, even the most formidable. Many of the rooms were furnished with most princely mag- nificence, and, as the light of day never entered there, they were artificially lighted, in the most brilliant manner. In one of the most splendid rooms of the vast cave, sat our  fair captive heroine-Eustatia "Elive. The splendor around   her had no charm for her heart, and,- though  almost be- wildered with surprise, still she turned from all witatn aching heart. The carpet over which she trod, was richer and more costly than any she had ever seen, even in the proud palace halls of that splendor-loving monarch, king Hen- ry Eighth, and the shading drapery, which con- cealed the rough, rocky walls of the room, was of the finest crimson velvet, embroidered with leaves and flowers of gold. The elegant furni- ture was also covered with the rich-hued velvet, wrought with devices of silver, intermixed with embroidery of gold.  A    chandelier, which, though of the rude style of the times, wra ex- tremely beautiful, and ornamented with gold and precious stones, was hung in the centre of the room, and the soft, clear light from its hundred lamps fell upon the rich drapery and furniture, and caused the gorgeous embroidery to glitter like innumerable diamonds. But the fair cap- tive knew that all this magnificence was but the spoils of piracy, and she scorned the spirit that I   could thus takefrom his fellow-man, by force of power, his rightful possessions. For the first time since she had been taken a captive, Lady Eustatia felt the extreme loneli- ness of her situation. While on board the Vic- tory, surrounded by the companions of her voVy age, who were always perfectly respectful in their manners towards her, and with her mind absorbed by the romantic beauty; of life, upon thejroad free ocean, she had not felt the deso- lation of spirit, which she now fully realized, when separated from all she loved. She thought of Norville, whom she so deeply and truly loved, of what his feelings would be when he ascertain- ed that she was nowhere to be found-of the frantic grief of her kind protector, the Count de Valence-as she fully realized that itewould be impossible for them to rescue her, as she could never be found in that winding cave, she bowed her head, and burst into tears. As she sat thus, weeping over her sad fate, she was suddenly aroused by the sound of musio. She raised her head, and listened attentively. The music was that of a  harp, touched by a skilful hand, and accompanied by a rich, clear, beautiful female voice, singing the following stanzas: "And though the clouds of sorrow Lie darkening o'er my way, Through them, a bright to-morrow Shines with a cheering ray. And while a captive sighing, Far on a foreign strand-- My thoughts are bird-like flying Back to my fatherland! And through Fate's sky so clouded, I see my own bright home; With joy the vision's shrouded, It lights the captive's gloom! While o'er the trackless ocean, Amid a lawless band, I turn with fond devotion, Back to my fatherland!" The singer ceased, and the soft echoes of her melodious voice died away, together with the sweet music of the skilfully-touched harp. The rich, deep, thrilling voice of the singer, the earn.   estness with which she had repeated her song, and its strange appropriateness to her own sit- uation, and the perfect music of every tone, all had their effect upon the almost enchanted Eas- tatia, and she listened with breathless interest She felt that the fair'singer was, like herself, a captive, and this added to the strange interest with which she already regarded her. She de- termined that the unknown musician should know that one heart, at least, responded to the song, and seizing a richly tuned harp which lay upon the table beside her, she touched the strings lightly at first, then with a more powerful hand. No maiden could have touched the beau- tiful instrument more skilfully than Lady Eus- tatia, and her almost magical hand drew forth from the fairy-like chords the most enchanting strains. The song, with which she accompanied the instrument, was a wild, thrilling German melody, and when sung by the matchless voice of Eastatia L'Elive, it was indeed irresistible. Her whole heart was in the song, and as she swept the seraphic chords of the richly-tuned harp, she almost wondered at her own power. As the last strains of the song died away amid the echoing recesses of the vast cave, a huge stone door was slowly opened, the rich velvet draperywas put aside, a light form flew noise- lessly over the yielding carpet, and knelt at the feet of the beautiful captive I "Pardon me, sweet lady, for this intrusion," said the stranger, in a soft, rich voice, which Eustatia recognized as that of the unknown mn- sician; "I know you cannot be displeased with me, sweet lady," continued the maiden, clasp- ing the hand of Eustatia in her own, and pressing it to her lips, " for I am, like yourself, a captive, and in this lonely cave, I pine for one gentle companion, one, like you, who can sympathize with me in my sorrows, and render less dreary my almost hopeless captivity. Let us be friends, sweet Lady'Eustatia, and I will never give you cause to rue the day on which you first met with Amina de Louvestein." "i May Heaven bless you for these words, dear lady!" gratefully said Eastatia, as her warm tears of thankfulness fell upon the hand   of her stranger-friend. "1 We are fellow captives, both captured, doubtless, for the same purpose, and, though we meet for the first time in a pi- rate's cave, let us, from this time, be true, faith- ful friends 1"' "I was your friend, fair lady, before I ever gazed upon your countenance," said Amina, again pressing the small jewelled hand to her lips, *" for I had ascertained, by a conversation I overheard between Captain Crescelle and his lieutenant, De Granoelon, that they intended to bring a lovelier maiden than had ever yet trod the deck of the Victory, to this mountain ren- dezvous, to be the bride of the buccaneer leader. I learned your name, station, and title, and even then, I felt a strong sympathy for you, and I resolved to be your friend, and if it was in my power, to save you from such a fate. I knew you were brought to this mountain cave but a few hours since, and, to assure you that there was also another who was a captive within its pre- cincts, I sung the words which you doubtless heard. I listened enraptured to the soul-thrill- ing music of your voice, and I could no longer restrain the desire to throw myself at your feet, and avow myself your friend." "And 1 bless you for it, dear Amina!" ex- claimed Eastatia, in heart-felt tone. i"It will lighten the sorrow Of my captivity, to have a kind friend by my side, to comfort me in the hours of anguish." "And in me you 'will find that one, dear Eas- tatia,". returned Amina, seating herself by the side of her new-found friend. "I will tell you my history, and then you shall judge if I am worthy of your confidence." -As the soft, subdued light from the many lamps fell upon the features of Amina de Lou- vestein, as she arose from her kneeling posture, it showed them to be of a beauty little inferior to those of the peerless belle of London, EuLta- tia L'Elive. Her large brilliant eyes were of a dark hazel, and earnest, yet spirited in their expression, and in their sparkling-depths shone a soul as pure and stainless as her own native skies. Her deep brown hair fell in shining olus- ters over neck and shoulders of faultless sym-     metry, and the broad, intellectual brow which they shaded was fair as classic statuary. The full, curved red lips were almost seraphic in their expression, and now, half parted with a smile, disclosed teeth of the finest ivory. There was no deception in that beautiful countenance, and Eastatia knew it. The heart that beat be- neath that rich dress, was true and noble, and the fair captive felt that in her she indeed found a friend. "I will tell you my history, Lady Eustatia," said Arina, seating herself by the side of her companion; "( and then if you think me unwor- thy of your friendship, I will not ask it." "I shall be a deeply interested listener," re- turned her companion. "Of my birth and lineage," commenced Amina, "I know but little, as it is somewhat deeply involved in mystery. My mother was a lady of extraordinary beauty, high-born and noble, but, for reasons which I never knew, she early left her hildhood's home, to seek one among strangers. Myself and my twin sister were her only children, and she loved us with all the affection of a doting mother. My father I never recollect of seeing, but I have seen my mother gaze long and sorrowfully upon the min- iature, that at all other times she carried in her bosom; which was the portrait of a noble look- ing young man, and who I have reason to be. lieve was her husband. That she loved him devotedly, I have no doubt; and that he re- turned her affection, also, I am sure, for no one could but love my beautiful mother, as I re- member her to be. We lived happily for eight years in a beautiful country seat in a retired town, myself and my twin sister scarce knowing a single sorrow to mar the sunshine of our hap- piness. I well remember my eighth birthday, and I can never forget it, for it was the last time I ever saw my dear mother or my beloved sister. My mother had placed around the necks of us both, as a birthday gift, a splendid neck- lace of gold and diamonds, upon the clasps of which were wrought our names, ages, and the name of our mother. 'My children,' said she, olavping them around our necks, ' wear these,   and should you ever be parted from each other, these may be the means of again re-uniting you. Wear them as the gift of your mother, and nev- er, my dear children, forget the giver.' Sainted mother  Never, while I draw the breath of life, can I forget thee - , "It was in the bright month of flowers and roses, and, as we loved to wander amid the beautiful groves that surrounded our beloved home, we pressed a kiss of childish affection upon the cheek of our dear mother, and, hand in hand, we left the mansion to wander away in search of flowers. My sister, who loved the birds and butterflies best, flew off in pursuit of them, while I, having no particular inclination to follow, wandered through the groves by the bank of the river, plucking the beautiful flowers that grew upon its margin, and singing the sweet wild songs of my native land, which my mother, who was an excellent musician, had taught me. I wandered thus for hours, entire- ly heedless of the impropriety I had committed, in wandering so far from the mansion, when the darkness, which now began to settle down upon the earth, awoke me to a sense of my situation. I turned to retrace my steps, but found it im- possible to discover the path by which we had come, and I determined to follow the course of the river, which I knew would lead me to my home. I had been hurrying along but a short time, when I discovered a bright light upon the water, which seemed rapidly nearing me. At first I was somewhat startled by the strange ap- pearance of the light, as it seemed borne along by invisible hands, but I soon discovered that it was a torch, held by some one who sat in a large and well-filled boat, which was rapidly approach- ing up the river. My heart bounded with joy, for I thought itmust be a party sent by my dear mother to look for me, and discover the cause of my long absence. But as they approached nearer, I saw that they were strangers, and though splendidly dressed, were a ferocious looking set of fellows as I ever beheld. I shrank back, but one of them observing me, sprang on shore, and catching me up in his arms, again sprang into his boat, which pushed rapid.   ly on. I felt that I should never see my dear mother and sister again, for I was every mo- ment going farther from them, and I wept bit- terly. The boat still shot rapidly down the river, and in spite of the loud laughing and talk- ing, occasionally interspersed with the most fearful cursing, of those who filled it, I soon wept myself to sleep. When I awoke, I found that my captors had just landed, and had laid me sleeping upon the ground, while they fasten- ed their boat, taking from it bales of articles which they had doubtless plundered from some wealthy baron. Feeling that anything was pre-   ferable to being their prisoner, I sprang up unobserved by them, and ran away as fast as possible, until I was out of reach of my captors. I then slacked miy pace, and resting myself a few moments, again walked on. I continued my journey, during the remainder of the night, and over a region which was entirely unknown to me, yet taking the direction of the castle of my mother as near as I could judge. As the shades of night again began to fall around, I threw my- self upon the green grass beneath a spreading tree, and being overpowered with weariness and anxiety, I was soon locked in deep slumber."     CHAPTER IX. CONTINUATIO* OF AMNA'3 IIITORY-A HOPE OF ESCAPE.   "No--no  Affection's debt Can ne'er be cancelled by a boon like this. Pride, in its strong tumultuous excess, Or passion's favor may in such find bliss, Love must search deeper yet 1" 8 the narrator hesitated .for a moment, seemingly lost amid the memories of other years, Lady Eastatia said: "Go on, dear Amina, for I am most deeply interested." "When I awoke, the morning sun was shin- ing brightly, and the heavens were blue again. I looked around, and discovered that, instead of reposing upon the ground, I was lying in the arms of a kind-looking, middle-aged man, whose cloak was wrapped around me to protect me from the night dews. He smiled so kindly and benev- olently as I opened my eyes and gazed into his countenance, that I felt that he was my friend. "'Will'you go with me, and be my little girl?' said the stranger, and, with a pleasant voice and smile that at once made me love him I attempted to raise my head, but found that my limbs were so stiff that I could scarcely use   'them. The stranger arose, and carried my light form to a handsome carriage which stood near by, waiting for its princely master, and after giving the driver his orders, he sprang into it, and we were soon riding rapidly away. "Of our journey, I remember little, save that it was long and tedious. At last we arrived at Paris, where my protector tola me was his home. Far more magnificent than aught I had ever before seen, was the splendid mansion of my benefactor; which he told me was hence- forth to be my home, and I thought that in such a palace, I must indeed be happy. His wife, who was a gentle, lovely being, threw her arms around me, and pressing me to her bosom, said in a voice that at once won my childish heart, 'My sweet little girl, will you not live with me, and be my own little daughter?' "I threw my arms about her neck, and mur- mured, ' Yes, and I will love you and you shall be my own dear mother.' My protector, whose name was the Marquis de Louvestein, adopted me as his daulghter, and I was known only as such. He had but one child, a son, but two   years older than myself, who was my constant companion, and whom I loved' as a brother. Yet, even in my happiest hours, there would, for a time, come thoughts of my lost mother and lovely twin sister over my heart, and I was far from happy. But the grief of childhood soon passes away, or, at least, becomes lighter, and, in my new companions I soon forgot my old ones. My new mother was all that I could wish, and my protector's son, whom I always called, ' brother Louis,' was a kind, generous and noble-spirited boy, and was now my constant companion. He attended me in all my walks about the city, protected me from harm or in- sult, studied, read, and sBng with me, and I' loved him as a brother. You need not smile so meaningly, Eustatia, for it was only as a brother that I loved him." "It, was somewhat strfnge that you should be thus thrown together, and that you should not love him with a different love," returned Lady Eustatia, gazing earnestly into the face of her companion. "Yet go on, for I am anxious to hear the remainder of your history." '"For ten'yars I lived thus, happy and con- tented, with my new friends, with scarce a cloud to mar the sunshine of my happiness. Though the memory of my youthful years saddened my spirits but little, still I had not forgotten my beautiful and beloved mother, my gentle and lovely sister, or my ohildhood's home, and at times I sighed for my old hdme again; but the kind, loving voices of my foster-parents, the pleasant attentions of my ' brother Louis,' and the devotedness of my many friends, who knew me only as the daughter of the Marquis de Lou- vestein, soothed my sadness, and I was happy again. Yet I still wore the last gift of my mother, the diamond necklace, and nothing c(all induce me to part with the priceless treasure. ' I was now eighteen. The marquis had done all in his power to render me an accom- plished lady, and neither wealth nor aught else was spared, that would fit me for any station, however high. I excelled in music and draw- ing, and could touch the harp with a more skil-   ful hand than any other in Paris. As the daughter of the Marquis do Louvestein, high- born, accomplished, and very wealthy, my so- ciety was courted by all, and I was a favorite with even the king of France. My mirror, as well as the lips of my many flatterers and ad- mirers, told me I was beautiful, and the richest and most costly of dresses and jewels enhanced the beauty nature had already given. I was the reigning belle of Paris 1 "The marquis and his noble lady were proud of their adopted daughter, and my brilliant triumphs gave none more pleasure than my noble protectors. Night after night, I entered the brilliantly illuminated halls of the noblesse of Paris, leaning gracefully upon the arm of some scion of royalty, for none, save the most noble, dared presume to ask the honor of the hand of Hedy Amina de Louvestein. . But, as yet, my heart had been my own-none had in- terested me for more than a passing thought, and some called me cold and heartless-yet I knew that in my heart there slumbered the germ of as deep and true an affection, as mortal ever gave. There were but few of my many suitors, for whom I did not cherish a common friend- ship, which, though not akin to love, was not i total indifference to them, and there was only one who really filled me with disgust at his disagree- able attentions, and horror at his many vices. "This one was Captain De Lacey, the com- mander of the large and splendid French war- vessel, the Orient, who was the only son of a noble and titled family, and had enlisted in the French naval service, not from necessity, for his parents were very wealthy, but from a love of the profession. He was proud, haughty, arro- gant and self-conceited, and his attentions were peculiarly disagreeable to me, and I soon began to regard him with a feeling of dread, not un- mingled with a vague fear of evil from his hand. Though a brave and excellent soldier, and a favorite of the king, still he was a disagreeable man, and I never could give him my friendship, much less my love. "It was a bright, beautiful summer evening, a short time after I had reached my eighteenth     birthday, that myself and Louis were walking upon the vine-wreathed balcony of the marquis's splendid mansion, admiring the beautiful scene which our city presented by moonlight. Louis, who was usually very cheerful and gay, now looked sad and solemn, and I could not guess the cause, and I playfully asked him if his lady- love had-discarded him, that he looked so un- happy? "' Amins,' said Louis, almost wildly, 'you know not what you say!' "' Indeed, dear Louis,' returned I, ' I do not understand why you are so sad.' "' Do you love me, Amina?' said he, in a strange, wild tone, which made me start with a cold thrill creepingyround my heart. "Love you, dear Louis?' exclaimed I, pas- sionately, and throwing my arms around the neck of my foster-brother, 'yes, yes, dearest brother, I love you as only a sister can love. But why can you doubt it, dear Louis? We have been constant companions for years, and not even an unkind word has passed between us. And why can you now doubt my love?' I exclaimed, tenderly kissing his forehead. "' O, Amina, Amina!' exclaimed Louis, passionately, kneeling at my feet and pressing my hand to his heart. ' You know that no ties of blood bind us to each other, and that the only reason why you are called my sister, is, that you are my father's adopted daughter. I love you, Amina, with as deep, true and holy an affection as mortal ever felt, but I would love you. not as a sister, but as a bride I  O, dearest Amina, do not scorn me for this i' "I now comprehended what I never suspect- ted before. Louis de Louvestein loved me, not as a sister, but with the deepest, holiest affec- tion of a mortal's heart, and I could not return it! I felt that I could never love him but as a brother, and overpowered with agonized emo- tion, I sank upon my knees by his side. I heard the voice of Louis, in a whisper of intense  earnestness, ' Dearest Amina, wilt thou be the bride of one who loves thee even better than life itself V I could not speak, but, in a voice husky with agony, I whispered, ' O, Louis, I van never love thee but as a brother i' ..    "I heard a deep groan, and Lnuis, rising from his knees, left me. I did not raise my head for some time, and when I did so, all was still and silent-I was alone. Hoping to calm my troubled spirit, I left the balcony, and wan- dered for some time amid the beautiful walks and fountains of the garden, and at last seated myself upon one of the moss cushions of a vine- wreathed arbor. I had not sat there long, be- fore a shadow darkened the door, and looking up, I saw the captain of the Orient standing beside me. A cold thrill of undefinable fear crept through my heart, for, when he had de- clared his passion to me, and sued for the honor of my hand, the very evening before, and I had discarded him and forbidden him my presence, he vowed revenge in a manner which I shud- dered to recall. But shaking off the strange sensation, I arose sfatelily, and endeavored to leave the arbor. The captain] placed himself before the entrance, and prevented my egress. "' How is this, Captain De Lacey?"elaim- ed I, haughtily. "' Simply, fair mademoiselle, that you are in my power,' returned the villain.     ' "I 'would have shrieked for assistance, but the captain caught me in his arms, and in anoth- er moment placed a tight band firmly over my mouth. He then placed a small silver call to his lips, and though the sound produced was very low, yet it was sufficient, and in another instant two more men, dressed in a costume evidently meant for disguise, entered the arbor; and stood ready to do the bidding of the captain. "' You have but to obey my orders,' said the villain. ' Ere the sun rises, let this maiden be safe beyond pursuit. I will soon join you, and until I do, keep a strict watch upon her, and if she escapes, remember that your lives must answer for it.' "A' To hear is to obey, Captain de Lacey,' said one of the new comers, taking my form in his arms. I struggled violently, when they bound my wrists tightly, and I found that re- sistance would be useless. O, how I then wish- ed for the strong arm of Louis de Louvestein to aid me I   "The men then conveyed me from the arbor', leaving Captain de Lacey alone. At a short' distance were fastened three horses, and after mounting me upon one, they sprang upon the other two, and one of them grasped the rein of the horse which I rode, while the other rode upon the opposite side, to guard against my es- cape. We rode on, at a brisk pace, for some time, until we had left Paris far behind. They then removed the band from my mouth, and also the cords from my wrins, but still grasped the horse's rein, so thhat 'had no chance for escape. We still rode on, itngl the ro;y beams of morn- ing gleamed in the'east, -when, turning the horses' heads in a different direction, they gal- loped on over the rocky ground for some time, and then alighted at a small, curiously conceal- ed cave, cut in the rock, and. which they obliged me to enter.  A scanty repast was spread upon a rude table in the centre of the only room it contained, and I partook slightly of it, though my despairing grief prevented me from doing so heartily. "I had been at the cave but about two hours, when a foaming charger drove up to the entrance, and Captain De Lacey alighted from it, and en- tered the cave. Many words passed between us; on my part, the conversation was spirited and haughtily fearless-on his, apologetic and flattering. But I was unyielding, and scorned him still. He compelled me again to mount the horse, threw his own cloak around me, and concealed my face by placing upon my head a peasant's cap. He then mounted his own charg- er, and  dismissing the two men, rode away, holding my herse's rein, as he knew my spirit too well to think that I would not attempt to escape from his power, if possible. We rode till night set in, often halting to change horses, when ours became weary with fast riding, and, at night, stopped at a small retired country inn, where the captain intended to remain during the night. Though I made several attempts to es- cape, yet in all I was foiled by the sleeplessly watchful villaig. The next morning we were early upon our journey, and, ere night again set ia, we reached the Orient. I had used every 4   possible means to induce Captain De Lacey to allow me to return once more to my kind pro- tectors, the Marquis and Marehioness de Lou. vestein, but all to no effect. I entreated, prom- ised, threatened-but only on one, condition would he let me go free, and that was that I would be his bride-and keep forever secret the events of my capture. This I firmly re- solved I would die rather than do, and in this frame of mind I first stood in the cabin of the Orient. "' This palace-like room has been fitted up expressly for you, charming Lady Amina,' said the villain, as he forced me to enter the splen- didly-furnished cabin, 'and that you will enjoy yourself here, is my sincerest wish.' "A look of ineffable scorn was his only reply. When I was once alone, I threw myself upon a rich cushion and burst into tears. I thought of my situation-of him in whose power I now was-of the declaration of Louis de Louvestein, and all but added to my agony. I then thought of my sainted mother, of my beautiful twin ais- ter, of my childhood's home-and I became strangely calm. I unclasped from my neck the last gift of my mother, and gazed long and earn- estly upon it. All the scenes of my youth came back before my memory's vision. It was too much for my already over-strained feelings--I fell upon the carpeted floor, insensible. "I was again roused to consciousness by a strange sensation of being almost stifled, and opening my eyes, I found that the cabin was filled with smoke. My presence of mind did not then desert me, and rushing to the cabin windows, I quickly dashed out the light, thin glass, and the cool night-breeze swept in refresh- ingly. I then sprang towards the door of the cabin, but, in passing over the rich carpet, I stumbled against something which lay upon it; I discovered it to be my diamond necklace. I quickly clasped it again around my neck, and, springing forward, endeavored to unclose the cabin door. But it was firmly and securely locked, and I could not open it. I could hear the voice of Captain De Laeey, rising firm and clear above all others, and I knew that they     were lowering the boats preparatory to leaving the vessel forever. I could hear the orders given, as also the terrible oaths and impreca- tions against some unknown person who had #red the ship, yet I heard not one word said respecting myself. The sounds of footsteps and voices became fainter-they ceased entirely- I could now hear nothing but the fearful crack- ling of the timbers, and the roar of the devour- ing element, and the fearful consciousness dawn- '  ed upon me, that I was left to perish alone, and in a most dreadful manner I "I resolved to make one more effort for life. I sprang again to the cabin door, and forcing it with all my strength, the look at length gave v way. A current of fiery smoke drove me back for an instant, but, springing through it, I soon stood upon the forward deck. The ship was en- tirely deserted. At a distance I could distin- guish the retreating boats, as the red glare of the flames gleamed far out upon the waters, and I felt that I must indeed die But one boat which was somewhat nearer than the others, I saw was rapidly returning, and as I gave a wild shriek for help, it was answered from the boat. They saved me, at the peril of their own lives, and, as I afterwards learned, it was the bucca- neer Cresoelle, who did the deed of burning the Orient, and also saved me. They took me on A   board the pirate vessel, the yiotory, and though I longed for my dear home again, they told me T must henceforth be content as the bride of a buccaneer. They brought me to this mountain cave, and the injustice and severity with which they have treated me has more than cancelled the debt I owe them for saving me from that burn- ing vessel. During the time I have been a captive here, I have learned many of the se- cret recesses and trap-doors of this vast cave, which I think may be serviceable in effecting the escape of us both. So do not despair, my friend, for we may yet be free." "Have you the diamond necklace, your mother's last gift, now?" eagerly asked the in- terested listener. "This is it," returned Amina, unclasping from her neck a splendid ornament, which she gave into the hand of Eustatia. Eagerly the maiden gazed at the words so richly wrought upon the clasp-as eagerly un- clasped from her own neck a chain of diamonds which was the perfect counterpart of the one she held in her jewelled hand, compared them for a moment, and then throwing herself into the oat- stretched arms of her beautiful companion, she murmured: "Amina, dear Amina,--my own    twin sister!"   CHAPTER X. EUSTATIA S DESPONDENCY-A NEW COMPANION--PROSPECT OF ESCAPE.   "There's not a waste, there's not a gloom, But has its sunny spot- And hours mid saddest life may bloom, Too sweet to be forgot!" OR several moments the two long separated sisters stood clasped in each other's arms, but they spoke not, for the hearts of both were too full of happiness at their strange re union, to have their heartfelt joy vented in words. "My own dearest sister!" at length mur- mured Amina.  "Heaven has at last granted that we meet again! But, dearest sister, know you aught of our mother! Does he yet live, 4o bless her long lost daughter?" "Our mother lives, dear Amina," returned the fair sister; " but I know little more of her, early history than you. Yet we shall know all in time, for she has promised that I should." "You forget, Eustatia, that we are prisoners, and may never leave this wild pirate cave alive But let us hope for the best, my sister, for I have learned all that was possible of these strange windings and recesses, that abound in this wonderful cavern. And there is one among these lawless buccaneers, whom I feel I can trust as a friend."   "Who?" "Lieutenant De Grancelon." "His show of friendship may..be but a mask for the most diabolical purposes." "It is not so, dear Eustatia." "What reason have you for thinking he is your friend?" "While upon the voyage here, he protected me from insult from his more hardened compan- ions, and endeavored to relieve my sad situation as much as possible. And, more than once, I overheard him remonstrating with the captain respecting me, and begging him to release me, as I pined for my home again. And the heart- iXess Cresoelle, like a fiend of darkness, refused all he asked, and even threatened to throw him overboard asatraitor, if he did not keep silence upon the subject. He has been kind to me, and I feel that his heart is not with his lawless life, but that he must have been driven to it by some strange fatality. De Granoelon, Eustatia, is at heart a true man, and he needs but some powerful influence to call forth all the nobleness of his true nature."     "I think he is a strange man, Amina. He assisted Crescelle in capturing me, and I then thought he was a villain, and shrank from him as such. But he has since been kind to me, as well as have all the buccaneers of this strange land, for they dared not do otherwise in their master's presence. But, sister, if he is what you think him to be, why does he follow this horrid pursuit?"  "I cannot tell, Eustatia. It may be that desperation drove him to it-it may be he has been enticed or betrayed into the snare, and found it impossible to break the chain which binds him. Be that as it may, he is not what he seems. He dos not enterinto their schemes so ardently as the rest of the band, but yet the captain reposes in him more confidence than in any other." "Bat why did he not plead for my release, as well as yours, Amina'?" "He did. Before you were taken. he en- deavored to make the captain desist from his project of making the fairest flower of England a buccaneer's bride, but it was without effect. Creseelle was inexorable. To De Grancelon's earnest plecdings, he returned only threats and words of anger. The lieutenant then knew it would be useless to do more, but I know he is the friend of us both, and has vowed to effect our escape if possible." "May Heaven grant it 1" "I respond to your prayer, dear sister!" "There is one who is left behind, in my own dear land, who will mourn my loss with agony of spirit, and it is for him that I most grieve. He cannot know the situation of his affianced bride-he knows not she is in the power of a heartless buccaneer, and has no means of aseer- taining my fate. The ocean is trackless, and the Victory, as she bounded over the waves, left upon them no impression to guide the lover in search of his beloved." "Then you have loved, sweet sister?" "Yes, Amina. I love one who is noble, true and faithful, and who would give up his life to save me, if he but knew my situation. But he cannot know it, and I am almost hope. less s"   "Do not say so, my sister! We may yet escape!" "I know we may, dear Amina, but fortune is fickle, and, should we at one time succeed in half accomplishing our purpose, the next attempt may crush our hopes forever." "We mdut not despair! Think of De Grance- Ion, whom I know is our friend, of my know- ledge of this cave, and the consciousness that our cause is one of right and justice, and you will not despair, sweet sister!" "Your words cheer me, Amina. I will be calm, and hope for the best. But we will leave this unpleasant subject, and speak of others." "With all my heart", dear Eustatia." "Do you know for what reason the captain of the ill-fated Orient left you to perish in his burning vessel?" "I do not. I think he must have been very angry with me, for the proud, scornful manner in which I treated his advances, and burning with revenge, left me to perish by a fearful death, for he thought there was no means of my escape. He could not have forgotten that I was in his cabin, a prisoner, and the ship must cer- tainly be destroyed, as the flames had nearly reached the magazine. But I escaped, only to enter upon a second captivity, as hopeless as the first, though it is not in my power to despise the buccaneer leader as heartily as I did Captain De Lacey. But fate, even in this strange cavern, had decided that I should here find my long lost, but still beloved sister, and may yet be the means of bringing back to me my dear and beautiful mother. I feel that De Grance- Ion will yet be my saviour, as well as yours, py sister." "  You place strange confidence in this man, Amina," returned Eustatia, with a slight smile upon her lips. "Take care of your heart, my beautiful sister, for you may yet, with your own free will, be a buccaneer's bride!" "Never, Eustatia, never!" said the spirited maiden, drawing her fine form to a still proud- er height, while her dark eyes gleamed with the fire of determination. "While Lieutenant De Grancelon is a member of this lawless band, a   sea-rover, and, if you will have the broad word, a pirate, Amina de Louvestein can never be- stow upon him her maiden heart, much less her hand as a bride!" At this moment the rich heavy drapery was. put aside, and a third party entered the room where sat the fair twin sisters. It was Lieuten- ant De Grancelon.  He bowed gracefully to the maidens, and, with a pleasant voice'and smile, said: "Pardon this intrusion, fair ladies, but as I knew you were together, I could not resist the temptation to leave the brilliant banquet-hall where my companions are passing the hours in mirth and revelry, to speak words of comfort and hope to you, and, bid you not despair, for there is one, at least, who is doing all in his power for your escapel and has determined you shall yet be free, even if his own life is sacrificed in the attempt to save you. I am your- friend, fair maidens, and be assured harm shall not come to you if I can prevent it."  The young girls looked up into the face of the man who spoke so kindly and encouragingly, and they saw only truth and nobleness written there. As De Grancelon stood there before the captive maidens, the soft, clear light of the many lamps falling upon his countenance, which was lighted up with a pleasant smile, he was indeed handsome.  His complexion, though slightly browned by exposure, did not in the least diminish his fine appearance, while the full, broad, intellectual brow, which had been shaded by the rich cap and thus protected from exposure, was fair and white as a maiden's. The cap Was now removed, and the noble brow was shaded only by the shining masses of curl- ing brown hair, which fell in profusion around a finely formed head. His eyes were a fine hazel, large, brilliant, and sparkling, from the depths of which gleamed a soul of noble truthfulness. A smile played around the proudly-curved lips, and gave the whole countenance an expression that could not but please the most fastidious ob- server. As the fair young maidens gazed upon the young man's handsome countenance, both murmured, half unconsciously, "Strange, very strange, that he should be a buccaneer!"   "It is indeed strange, sweet maidens," said De Grancelon, to whom the murmured words were audible; "but if you will listen, I will give you a brief sketch of my history, and then you may judge how far to place confidence in me." Each expressed the pleasure it would give them to listen to the recital, and throwing him- self upon a cushion at the feet of Amiua do Lou- vestein, he commenced:  "I was the only son of the noble, high-born, and wealthy Duke De Granoelon, one of the proudest families of the land, and closely allied to Francis I, the present king of France. My- self and my sister, Ediana, were our parents' only treasures, and as we were of royal lineage, wealthy, and, I may add without egotism, hand- some and talented, our society was sought and courted by all. I, at the time my hibtory, or rather the romantic part of it, commences, was nearly twenty-two years of age, while Edia- na was but eighteen. I had not, as yet, found one whom I thought worthy of my heart's affec- tions, but my gentle sister had loved, and was beloved in return. She was happy, and, as t loved my fair young sister, I 'pictured for her, in imagination, a life of almost cloudless hap- piness with the one to'whom she had given her young and trusting heart. There was but one cloud to mar the sunshine of our happiness, and, at that time, I cared but little for that, for I feared no danger from it. This drawhack to our pleasure was in the threats aand menaces of Lord Aryston, who had for some time professed a deep attachment for Ediana, but whom she detested. I knew he was a villain, by his guilty look and manner at times, but my father, more easily deceived, favored him. When it became known to him that Lady Ediana De Grancelon was soon to be wedded to his bittcrest rival, Count Armand Julian, his anger knew. no bounds, and he vented it in threats against my sister. At her earnest request, my father at last forbade his further visiting at our mansion, and for a time, we heard no more of him. "The wedding evening of Ediana had at last arrived, and with a heart full of joy and happi-     ness, my dear sister arrayed herself in her bridal dress, not dreaming that there was even a cloud in the happiness of her future. Count Julian, her destined husband, was every way worthy of her, and I felt that her future was indeed to be one of happiness. If I thought of Lord Arys- ton, it was only with contempt for his threats, and I smiled to think how perfectly he had been thwarted in his' hopes of obtaining Ediana. "' I am going to take a short stroll in the garden, brother,' said my sister, addressing me; ' I shall be back very soon, so you need not tell Armand where I have gone, for I wish to have a few moments' communion with my thoughts, alone, before I become abride.' And kissing my brow tenderly, she turned and glid- ed from the room. I gazed after her until she had disappeared; for then, I thought my dear sister more beautiful than any other maiden I had ever before seen. And she was indeed lovely. I seem to see her now, just as she ap- peared when she then tripped so lightly away from me, with her soft blue eyes sparkling with hope and joy, her golden tresses shining in the rich light of the many lamps, while her splendid dress and glittering diamonds but rendered her more brilliantly beautiful. But a horrible vis-, ion comes over this, and shuts out the sweet dream of n1fair sister. '"Th't rge and splendid hall was soon filled. The priest who was to unite the happy pair had arrived, and I began to wonder why my sister id not return.  I thought she must have wan- ered farther than she at first intended, or per- haps met with some accident, and I had just started to go in search of her, when a hand was laid lightly upon my shoulder, and turning, I saw Count Julian standing beside me. His handsome countenance was shadowed by an ex- pression of anxiety. ' Where is Ediana?' he asked, with an earnestness which betrayed fears for her safety. I told him all I knew respect- ing her absence, and we both left the hall in search of her. The moon was shining -bright and clear from the cloudless sky, and lighted up everything with a golden radiance, while the breeze, which scarce shook the leaves of the   countless roses, was soft as the breath of ans angel. "I r can scarcely wonder that Ediana tarries amid such a scene of loveliness as this,' said Armand, pleasantly, ' but yet it is strange that she-' "Ho was interrupted by a scene that met his eyes as we turned a corner of the garden path, and we both stopped quickly and gazed, almost thunderstruck, upon it. There, silent and mo- tionless, with her face to the earth, lay my sis- ter--I knew, at first sight, that it was her, by the golden ringlets that fell upon her neck, as well as by the rich bridal dress that stone brightly in the clear moonbeams. A fearful suspicion flashed over my mtnd. I sprang for- ward, and raised the body. The horrible sight that met my eyes almost drove me to frenzy. The rich satin dress was stained and deeply- dyed with the heart's blood of my dearest sister, as well as was the ground upon which she had 'been lying I The hilt of a dagger protruded from her bosom, which I drew hastily out, and the lifeblood folfed it profasely.  The long, ;golden tresses which fell upon her bosom, were also stained and matted, and as I hastily brush- , ed them away to get a look at her countenance, I saw that her eyes were glassy and expression- less, and her face white as the orange-blossoms which bound her hair. I placed my hand upon her brow-it was fast approaching the icy chil- liness of death I There wad no shutting out the I fearful truths- y sister was dead! "I turned-to look for Count Julian.  He stood beside me-gazing at the body of his affianced bride, but in his eyes there was a wild, strange brilliancy that I had never seen there before, and the wild expression of his coun- tenance told me that reason had fled-Armand was a maniac! '"I turned once more to the body, which I had been supporting with my  right arm. The bloody dagger lay upon the ground beside it, and as I  glanced at it, I noticed there was a name engraven upon the hilt. I quickly snatch- ed it up, and by the light of the moon I could easily distinguish the name-it was ' Lord Lu- cien ArystonP'   "A feeling, that I had never before expe- i rienced, now burned withinmy bosom. I knew c that Lord Aryston was the murderer of my e beautiful and beloved sister, and that his dark I threats were now most fearfully executed. I 1 raised my left hand, which still grasped the 1 blood-stained dagger, to heaven, while with my 1 right I supported the dead form of my sister. 1 And there, in the presence of my dead sister, ( and her maniac lover, I vowed to be her'  avenger-to rest not until her murderer had paid the penalty for his crime-had joined the murdered, in the spirit-world. I then felt calm- or, but my agony for the death of my sister was almost frenzied. I took her in my arms, and bearing her to the mansion, entered the brilliant hall, where were assembled the now impatient guests. The maniac followed, laugh- ing wildly in his madness, but yet keeping his wild, dark eyes fixed upon the marble counte- nance of Ediana. "In a firm  voice, I informed the horror- stricken company of all that had happened. Groans of anguish, mingled with threats of ven- geance, filled the hall, which before resounded to the sound of joyous voices, and merry laugh- ter. pKing Francis, who was present to witness the bndal, approached the corpse of my fair sister, who was closely allied to himself by blood, and as he kissed her icy brow, he vowed by his royal diadem, that she should be avenged. "She was buried. Her maniac lover, who bad not been able to withstand the shock upon his reason, and my mother, who loved her daugh- ter too well to long survive such a dreadful event, were soon laid by her side. My father gave all his immense wealth into my hands, and retired to a convent to spend the remainder of his days. All attempts to discover Lord Arls- ton had proved unsuccessful, and the search had been given up by allexcept one-and that was the brother who had vowed, over the corpse of his murdered sister, to be her avenger. I closed the mansion, placed the keys of my wealth   in safe hands. and, with that blood-stained dagger in my bosom, I set out to make another effort to discover the murderer. By almost a miracle, I found a clue to his hiding-place. I learned many things, that only sharpened the power of my revenge. I learned, also, that his true name was not Lord Lucien Aryston, but that the man who had so often joined the merry company at my father's mansion, who had mur- dered my only sister, was the fearful buccaneer whose name had filled all Europe with terror at his daring piracies, the fearless, lawless, daring, CRESCELLE I "I was astounded at this intelligence, yet I felt that it was true. By dint of the most un- remitting perseverance, I at last discovered their mountain cave. I had already determinedzupon my course of action, and disguised myself so that I could not have been recognized. Suffice it to say, I was admitted to their band, I recog- nized in their leader the murderer of my sister, and I ktew that my revenge was sure. For three years have I now been with them, learn- ing their secrets, with the most skilfulrngenuity, and the captain has never suspected that I am the brother of the maiden he so foully murdered, on her bridal eve. I gave him' my name as De Grancelon, merely to see what effect the sound of the name would have upon him, know- ing that he would not recognize me in that dis- guise. I have learned every recess of this vdt cave-every facility for escape from their ene- mies to which they resort-and the whole band are now in my power. Though, to blind the eyes of the captain, I have pretended to enter into his nefarious schemes, I never slew a mortal in cold blood, and I have never taken the life of but one man, and that was to save my own. f I have already sent to king Francis an account of my adventures, and directed him to send two of his best war-vessels to the cave, without de- ; lay; and ere another moon shall wax and wane, e the buccaneer band that so long have been the [ terror of Europe, will be no more!" i'         -     CHAPTER XI. DE GRANOELON  AND THE FAIR CAPTIVES-A TIIRILLING SCE NE- TE PROPHECY AGAIN.   "In the darkest night, and the bright daylight, In earth, and sea, and sky- In every home of human thought, Will love be lurking nigh." XTENDING her hand to the handsome young man, as he closed his deeply inter- esting history, Amina frankly said: "Lieutenant De Grancolon, forgive me, if I have indulged, even for a moment, the thought that you were as cold-hearted and reckless as the outlaw band to which circumstances have joined you. I admire your heroism, your cour- age, and your undaunted bravery and daring, which has thus been able to trace out the mur- derer of your only sister, and bring to light as deepdyed a band of villains as ever trod the earth; but forgive me if I tell you frankly, that I cannot admire the traitorous part which you play." "Lady Amina," said De Grancelon, quickly, pressing to his lips the jewelled white hand which he clasped within his own, "I had made a solemn vow that I would be the avenger of my murdered sister. With the most extreme difficulty and danger, I traced out her murderer.   But he was guarded by one of the most wonder- ful caves of nature, and could I have drawn to- gether all the armies of Spain, France, and England combined, I could not have conquered his band-for the secret recesses of this vast cave are as numerous as they are wonderful. To one who is unacquainted with them, it is t utterly useless to endeavor to take one of the pirates after he has ,once concealed himself. And they cannot be surprised and thus taken, for these recesses are so dark and ingeniously contrived, that a man who knows them can slip quickly into one of them, and should a pursuer endeavor to take them, he would only find him- self loot in its windings, without being able to find any traces of the pursued. Thus you obh serve, sweet lady, that it would be impossible for me to do aught against him if I did not know these secret recesses. I might have en- ticed the captain from the cave by some means, and then taken his life-but I scorned such a cowardly action. Besides, I owed a duty to my country and to all the nations of Europe, as I had discovered the cave of the buccaneers,   to bring themto justice This, as I said before, was impossilie, if I did not learn the secrets of their cave. I had vowed to avenge my murdered sister-I owed a duty to my country and to the world-can you blame me for the part I have taken?" "No-no, Lieutenant De Grancelon. I cannot blame you. I have misjudged you," returned Amina, a bright smile lighting up her features, which rendered her all the more lovely in the eyes of the admiring young buccaneer. "You have acted rightly," continued the maid- en; "no mortal could do more.  There is naught in your actions that I would condemn or censure. Did I not speak rightly, when I told you we had one friend here, Eustatia?" "You did, dear sister," returned Eustatia, frankly; " this history, which has deeply inter- ested me, has removed every prejudice or dis- trust which I might have entertained of him. You were more penetrating than myself, sweet sister, but yet I felt that he was not what he seemed." De Grancelon looked up surprised. "Can it be possible, Lady Amina," said he, quickly, "that our beautiful captive is your sister 2" "It is indeed so," returned Amina, smiling bewitchingly; "we have been separated for many years, but fortune, has thrown us once more together. But an hour since, in this very room, for the first time for ten years, I clasped to my bosom my own dear twin sister!" "Then I know you will pardon me, fair Lady Eustatia, for the part which I took in your cap- ture," said DoGrAcelon, earnestly. "You are freely pardoned," answered the maiden, "for I know that you would not have injured me, had it been in your power to refuse without exciting suspicion of your faithfulness to the band." "You are right, lady. When Captain Ores- celle informed me he had determined upon bring- ing Lady Eastatia L'Elive to this mountain ren- dezvous as a captive, I plead for you with all my power, until I really roused his anger, and he forbade me to speak of the subject again.   When I saw that all further attempts to dis- suade him from his purpose would be unsuccess- ful, I said no more, but entered into his plans for your capture with seeming interest. But I vowed that you should not be his bride. I im- mediately prepared a history of my adventures, for king Francis, and succeeded in sending it to him without excitingsuspicion. Before three days more will have elapsed, two of the best French war-vessels will be anchored in the cove where the Victory ,now lies so peacefully, and with me for a guide, they cannot fail to take every one of the buccaneers. They intend to spend some time at this cave, carousing and making merry among themselves, while some of them will be sent, disguised, of course, to the larger cities of the interior, to dispose of the rich spoils of piracy which have been accumula- ting upon our hands for some time, and receive Spanish gold in return. They are at this mo- ment, carousing in the large banquet-hall of the cave, which I left to come to you. You can look in upon them unobserved, ladies, if you wish; and then you will fully realize the ro- mance of a buccaneer's life." Both Amina and Eustatia were pleased with the proposal, and De Grancelon rising, took a hand of eauh of the maidens, and led them from the room. "You must be silent, sweet ladies," whisper- ed De Graneelon, "for a word wight betray us, and place us in an unpleasant situation." He led them through a long, winding passage, and opening a concealed door, tley sprang through into a dimly-lighted, but richly-furnish- ed room. The sound of boisterous revelry was now plainly heard. De Grancelon placed his finger upon a spring concealed by the rich dra- pery, and a small door sprang open, disclosing s a secret passage, at the opposite side of which a few rays of light gleamed through a rich crimson - curtain. Again grasping the hands of the maid- , ens, he approached it, and drew the curtain  carefully aside. The scene of splendor that met I the eyes of the astonished sisters, would well I compare with the most glowing Eastern pio- tures of the Arabian Nights. Between two and     three hundred men were drinking, singing, and carousing around the heavily loaded tables, which extended the whore length of the immense banquet-hall. They were dressed in the splen- did costume of the buccaneer band, and the massive gold goblets which they often raised to their lips, filled with the sparkling wine, glitter- ed in the rays of countless lamps, which were hung from the walls of the room. Though their countenances showed that' they were from every nation, still upon the faces of all there was the demoniac expression that characterized the band. At the head of one of the principal tables sat the buccaneer captain, Crescelle. There was a strange expression upon his dark, yet hand- some features, that spoke of anxiety of mind, and his proud lip was curled fiercely. Turning to one who stood beside him, he said, half haughtily: "Where is De Grancelon?" "He left the hall an hour ago," answered the other. II guess he has gone to keep company with the pretty little wench you rescued from the Orient." "Confound the girl!" said another old pirate who had overheard the question and answer; "I believe she's bewitched the lieutenant. He's been very absentlminded ever since he saw her, and when we say anything about giving her to the sharks for breakfast, some fine morn- ing, he looks as cross as old Cape Clear, in a hail storm!" "Then you think De Grancelon is in love with Lady Amina, do you, Caritan?" asked the captain, a slight smile curving his fine lips. "I know he is," returned the' other, de- cidedly. "Very well, be may have the star. but the fair queen of night is mine," said the buccaneer captain, as he again relapsed into moody silence. "Haveyou seen enough, fair ladies?" cau- tiously whispered De Grancelon. "  We are ready to return," murmured Ami- na, and instantly dropping the curtain, they re- traced their steps, and once more stood in the room which they had left.   "A buccaneer's life is exciting," said Eusta- tia, as they closed the heavy stone door and re- placed the drapery, " and there is about it no small degree of romance." "But, Lady Eustatia," said De Grancelon, "if you had been a member of a lawless band as long as I have, you would say, that the hor- ror, cruelty and wickedness of such a life swal- lows up its romance." "I do not doubt your words," returned Eus- tatia; "I shudder now to think of the fearful scene which I witnessed while on board the Victory." "It was indeed fearful," answered De Grance- lon, " for the vivid and terrible scene of the blowing up of the trader was still fresh in his mind. "But why are you so sad, Lady Eus- tatia?" "I was thinking of the mournful fate of your poor sister, Ediana," said Eustatia, sighiog, "and its dreadful effect upon her lover. Yours is a sad history, Lieutenant De Grancelon." "It is indeed so," said the young man, while a tear that he could not repress, moistened his eye, as he thought of the fate of his beautiful and beloved sister. "But," he continued, his eyes flashing brighter, "she shall soon be avenged!" Amina, who .had not spoken since they re- turned from the banquet-hall, was seated, deep- ly engaged in thought, upon a low ottoman some distance from her companions. ' She was think- ing of what the old pirate had said-that De Grancelon loved her, and it is true that the emo- tions such a knowledge called up, were not otherwise than pleasurable. Ihe parcely dared  to ask her own heart to ascertain her feelings for him, for she knew not that he loved her, though the eloquent glances of his speaking eyes had often sent a thrill to her heart. She felt emotions which she had never before ex- perienced-she knew that the man who was so faithful to the memory of a sister, could not be unfaithful to one to whom he had given his heart. De Grancelon, who half-guessed her thoughts, now approached her. He knelt supplicatingly   at the feet of Amina de Louvestein, and clasp. ing her hand within his own, he said, tenderly: "Amina, while we were gazing upon the oc- cupants of the banquet-hall, you doubtless heard the conversation between Caritan and the cap- tain, respecting my feelings for you. He little knew how near his words were to the truth. Yes, Amina, -while you have been with us, my feelings have undergone a change. My finer sensibilities, which were becoming blunted by daily contact with this heartless band, were re- newed by the soft light of your beaming eye, while your smile awoke in my bosom new sen- sations. I had never known the bliss of loving. and had never felt a deep affection f6r any maid- en save my only sister. But, while gazing upon you, the sleeping spirit within my bosom awa- kened, and I loved-loved deeply, wildly, earn- estly, and now I hope for such a love in return. ,Yes, dearest Amina, I love you! Can you, fairest, dearest lady, grant me a place in your maiden heart?" Amina could not answer. Her heart was full, but she raised her eyes to the face of her com- panion, and their glance was fraught with love. "Dearest Amina," continued the young man, "my heart bounds with hope  You do not withdraw your hand-you do not bid me desist- and I know you cannot be offended  Speak, dearest, and pronounce the tender words that will make me the happiest of men! But tell me that you will be mine, and I will promise to love you unceasingly, to be faithful to you in time and eternity, as I have been to the memory of my departed sister!" A tear of joy glittered on the cheek of Amina. and bowing her head, it fell upon the shoulder of her lover. Her brown curls shaded his neck and bosom, and mingled with his own shining looks. De Grancelon's fine eyes beamed with joy. "I am yours " murmured Amina, as her handsome lover threw his arm gently around her, and tenderly kissed her cheek. "And art thou mine forever, Amina?" "Forever!" "Then I am blessed," murmured the young   and noble lover, as he pressed his promised bride to his bosom. "But we must not speak of love until we are free from the power of this lawless band,"- said Amina, raising her head from  her lover's shoulder. "You shall be free, my Amina," exclaimed De Grancelon, his eyes flashing with the fire of determination. "Neither you nor your sister shall suffer, while Orland De Granoelon can raise his arm in your defence." "I will trust you, dear Orland," said the maiden, "but I hope we shall soon bid adieu to this buccaneer rendezvous, and once more stand upon the soil of sunny France." "Your hope shall soon be realized, py Ami- na. We shall soon see the shore of r own fair native land. And when there, I will once more take from the hands of others my vast wealth, assume my title of duke, and present you to the world as my honored and beautiful bride, the Duchess De Grancelon!" "I am happy," murmured the maiden, as she cast a look of undying love upon the counte- nance of the noble young man. "Ah, sister," exclaimed Eustatia, approach- ing the lovers, with a merry smile upon her countenance, "did I not say that you would yet become a buccaneer's bride, of your own free will?"     4 The only reply of Amina was a deep blush. De Graneelon now arose from his knees, and addressing both the maidens, said pleasantly: "I must now leave you, for my companions in the banquet-hall will be seeking for me. Here," continued he, taking a pair of splendidly -mounted pistols from his belt, " are a pair of weapons which I will leave with you, that you may protect yourselves from insult, should Cap- tain Creseelle visit you in my absence, or should any other of his band. Do not fear to fire them-whoever insults such as you, ought to die. They are both loaded-I suppose you know how to use them, don't you?" "O, yes, certainly," returned Eustatia, laugh- ing, as she examined the rich mounting of the weapon.     "And, my dear girls, do not fear but that you shall soon escape. Before three days will have elapsed, the French war-vessels will be here. The captain does not suspect but that I am a friend to this lawless band, and therefore he will not watch my motions. And as I am lieutenant, I have licence to go where I choose, and in any part of the cavern. All will be ready for an immediate victory when the ves- sels arrive. The band cannot escape. If my heart should fail me, or my soul recoil at the traitorous part I am playing, I have but to think of that moonlight evening when I clasped the dagger of Lord Lucien Aryston in my clenched hand, and vowed, in the presence of the maniac and the dead, to be my murdered sister's aven- ger. It gives me strength to press onward in the performance of that vow-and   ere many days have passed, it will be fully, fearfully fulfilled. Ah, little does the heartless bucca- neer captain think that the deed, so foully done, is yet to be avenged I  That his many crimes, his murders, and his fearful deeds are- " "' Villain, fiend, traitor!" cried a voice hoarse with anger and desperation, and a portion of the velvet drapery was flung aside, and Captain Crescelle, pale with rage and fear, entered the room. "You are discovered!" he ,cried, in a terrible voice.  " I have overheard your con- versation!   I know yc* are a traitor I lou your sister's avenger I Do you think our vow will be fulfilled now I I scorn you  You are now to pay the penalty for this I Die, coward, villain, traitor!" Eustatia shrieked, and sunk almost fainting c to the floor. But Amina, calm  and self-pos- I sessed, stood proudly by the side of her lover, 1 fearing nothing when he was menaced with dan-  ger. De Grancelon stood firm and erect, with s a   fearless smile upon his curved lip, and bend- c ing upon the captain a look of ineffable scorn,  The captain cocked his pistol, and approaching ' De Granoelon, levelled it at his heart, and fired. ( But the young man sprang aside, with the1 ra- v pidity of lightning, and the ball passed by him t harmlessly. Amina, drawiog her own pistol, d which had been given her by De Grancelon, E   levelled it at the captain, and firing instanta- neously, the charge passed through his left arm. With an exclamation of rage and pain, he darted towards Amina, who sprang aside, and flew to the door at which the captain had entered. He followed, and the plan of the heroic girl was im- mediately laid. The passage whic she was en- tering, she well knew, as well as all its recesses and trap-doors. On flew Amina, and on bound- ed Crescello, determined to take the life of her who had so daringly attempted his own. It was a race of life or death! The passage was in most portions of Egyptian darkness, and when lighted at all, it was only by the gleams from the lamps of 'adjoining rooms; But the white dress of the maiden guided the pursuer; and, thinking of nothing but the escape of his victim, he darted on. He had already unsheath- ed the Arabian scimitar, and as the gleams of light fell upon it, it glittered with a brilliancy that seemed to tell that it was destined to be soon stained with blood. Amina knew that her life was in the most imminent peril, and the thought gave her feet the fleetness of a deer. Doors were thrown violently and hastily open- all barriers wore quickly surmounted, and for a few moments neither seemed to gain on the other. On flew the pursued, and on bounded the pursuer, both wildly excited by the race. A mina determined upon a final attempt.  Dart- ing aside from the firm stone floor of the pa;s- sage, she stepped upon a trap-door, which gave way beneath her weight, and she alighted upon the floor of one of the secret dungeons of the cave. Intent upon securing his victim, he did not hesitate to think of consequences, and springing upon the trap, he was quickly landed upon the floor of the dungeon below.  The traapdoor sprang back to its place-Amina- had passed out at ,the only door which led from the dun- geon, and was firmly bolting it upon the outside. The captain soon realized his situation-the trap could be opened only upon the outside-there was no secret passage from the dungeon-and though he threw his whole weight against the door, the bolts firmly resisted the shocks. No sound could penetrate those stone walls-all   was dark as Erebug, and without sustenance,' the captain knew that he was doomed, and the thought that it was the work of his cunning vie tim, as he had hoped she soon would be, drove him almost to madness I The buccaneer was caught in his own trap-he must die I But the heroic maiden was also a prisoner. The room into which she had passed was also a secret dungeon, and there was no outlet, that she knew of, save the door which led into the room where the captain was a prisoner. To   "attempt to escape by, is, she knew was impos- sible. But the thongh that her lover was safe, and their foe a prisoner, consoled her, and she resigned herself to her fate. She had saved her lover's life-and the noble, heroic maiden could now, die in peace. Meanwhile, the captain pnced the narrow bounds of his cell, in a state almost of frenzy, and muttering-"If my fate is scaled now, the sybil's prophecy will not be fulfilled!"   CIIAPTER XII. NORVLILE BLANCHFORD--A CLUE TO THE MAIDIENS CAPTORS-INTERVIEW 'WITH IINa HENRY-- A STRANIGE COMMUNIOATION.   "Her form and look, in memory's glass, I still distinctly see; Her voice and words, in fancy's ear, Are whispering still to me." ,ANCE more the thread of our story 'takes us back to the shores of proud Old Eng- land, and there, in imagination, we will take the reader.* The sun had risen gaily over the city of London, and, as its bright beams gilded the turrets and towers, the gay and stirring populace awoke once more to the labors and pleasures of the day. The large and well-filled war-vessels upon the river once more presented the appear-' ,ance of busy life, as well as the gay city which they protected. Walking the deck of his noble vessel, and deeply engaged in meditation, was the young and handsome Captain Norville Blanchford, an expression of unpleasant anxiety resting upon his noble brow. It was the morning after the capture of Lady Eustatia, and though he was not yet aware of what had transpired, still he feared some accident, must have befallen his fair "lady-love."  He knew that she would have met him at the hour designated, if it had been in her power, and an a lmost groundless   fear that she had been foully dealt with, crossed his mind. "All is not right," murmured the young captain, as he paced the deck with his arms folded upon his breast, " for Eustatia is not tho girl to fear imaginary dangers, and rarely real ones. I have not seen her since the levee at their mansion, which is now several days. She would doubtless wish to meet me, most espe- cially, When I had sent for her, to communicate to her intelligence of importance to us, both. i Can it be that what I have learned of this Earl of Gordon is indeed true? That he is but a villain in disguise? And has, perhaps, prevent- ed my Eustatia from meeting her lover, though, for what reason, I cannot tell. But there may be some mistake about this, for Reginald might not have delivered the letter faithfully. I must call him and see." In a few moments the boy who had given Norville's letter into the hands of the Earl of Gordon, stood upon the deck before his master. "Reginald," said the captain, inquiringly, "did you give the letter with which I sent you   yesterday, into the hands of Lady Eastatia?"'     The boy hesitated. Norville's suspicions were aroused, and he repeated the question. The youth, seeing no alternative, told his master the truth. "Can you describe the person to whom you gave the letter?" asked Norville. "He was tall, handsome, and elegantly dress- ed, and mounted upon a splendid black charger. His eyes were black and sparkling, his hair brown, and his smile very fascinating. He wore the costume of an earl, and-" "Enough," muttered Norville, impatiently, "you may go below." As the boy obeyed, the captain resumed his walk, occasionally mut- tering, half angrily, "It is the Earl of Gor- don!" For several moments he paced the deck, scarce heeding what was passing around him. The sound of oars soon arrested his attention, and looking up, he saw a small skiff approaching the vessel from the shore. As it touched the side of the Conqueror, a man sprang upon deck, and approached Norville, whom the young captain instantly recognized as one of the servants of Count de Valence. "I have come to ask you," said the stranger, somewhat sternly, addressing Captain Blanch- ford, " if you can give us any information res- pecting Lady Eastatia L'Elive?" "What! has aught happened to Lady Eus- tatia?" exclaimed Norville. "Last evening," answered the new-comer, "she left the mansion to meet you upon the banks of the Thames. She had received a note from you, requesting her to meet you at the hour of nine, near the spot where the Conqueror was anchored. Knowing that the Count de Valence would not consent to such an under- taking, she informed no one of her intention, save myself. I endeavored to dissuade her from her purpose, but she was firm. I assisted her to mount her horse, and saw her ride away in this direction, since which time I have not seen her. Thinking that it would be best to oome to you, and ascertain if she was safe here, before informing the Count de Valence of the eirumstanees, I left the mansion, with the hope   of learning from you, that my fair mistress was e safe. When did she leave you, Captain Blanch- D ford?" "When did she leave me? I have not seen I her!" exclaimed Norville, in a voice of agony. "Did she not meet you, last night?" "She did not!" "But you sent for her?" I did." "And you have heard no tidings of her?" "Nothing." "Impossible!" "It is no less true!" "There has been foul play in this matter." "I do not doubt it." "It must be looked to immediately." "I would give my life to save hers!" "But I scarcely think your life will be need- ed. There is mystery in all this, and I fear our fair Eustatia has been foully dealt with." "The Earl of Gordon has had a hand in this matter!" "Do you think so?" "I have no doubt of it." "My good friend, your words only confirm my own suspicions. There is something in the eye of the Earl of Gordon, which tells more than he would wish me to know. But cheer up, Captain Blanchford, and do not give way to use- less anguish, for your strong arm is needed to fathom this dark mystery. You must see the king-and lay this matter before him, and as Lady Eustatia was his favorite, and the belle of London, I think he will do his best to have her found. Come, captain, we must to action," After giving a few orders to his lieutenant, Norville sprang into the skiff, following the ex- ample of his companion. The agony of the young man was indescribable. That Eustatia, his affianced bride, was now in danger, the greatness of which he did not-know, caused him to forget all else, and give himself up to the anguish of his reflections. He was aroused from his reverie by the voice of his companion, the count's servant, and quickly springing from the boat, both stood upon the bank. Horses were in readiness, and each mount- N    ing one, Norville and the servant, Franton, took their way towards the royal palace, carefully examining the tracks of horses which were im- printed upon the soft ground, for the road was the same Lady Eustatia would have taken. The servant, who well knew the peculiar track of his mistress's charger, was beginning to look dis- appointed, when springing from his horse, he gazed eagerly at a deep and peculiar imprint of a horse's foot which he had suddenly discovered. "This is Lillie's track!" cried Franton, re- ferring to Eustatia's charger. "I knsow it! As I thought you might give me intelligence of my mistress, I did not think of examining the tracks as I passed the road an hour ago, and therefore did not notice it. This will, I think, give us a clue to the lost lady. There has been strange work here!" Norville, who had sprung from his horse, was also examining the tracks of the charger. They plainly showed that the spirited animal had endeavored to escape, but had not succeeded. The tracks of Crescelle were also plainly seen, as well as those of De Grancelon and the other horses. Norville, who was now fully excited to the sense of Eustatia's peril, determined to follow the track immediately, if possible. "Ha, here is a ring that belonged to one of them," said Franton, as he picket' up a glitter- ing diamond circlet from the ground. Blanch- ford took it instantly, and examining it intently for a moment, discovered it to be one which he had before seen upon the hand of the Earl of Gordon! "This belongs to the one who captured Eus- tatia," he said, with forced calmness. "And who is that?" asked Franton, ea- gerly. "The Earl of Gordon!" "I suspected it I Fool that I was, to allow her to go unattended, while danger was to be feared from such a villain!" "But there seems to have been two or three of the captors, and even your arm would have been useless to save your mistress, and your life have been the forfeit of the endeavor." "True-true, Captain Blanohford."   "I alone am to be blamed for this. I did not realize the dangers to which she was expos- ed, when I sent for her to meet me. I wished to see her much, and as I could not leave my vessel, fearing the Alcena was preparing some stratagem to take us, I sent for her to come. But I will not rest an instant from the search, until Eustatia is once more restored to her home. [ will fear nothing-halt for nothing, until she is free from the power of that villain!" "This track will guide us in the search. See, it turns into this footpath, and three other horses also, so it seems there was at least three of them. Ah, no, this horse was without a rider, I should think, by the peculiar manner in which the tracks are impressed. Poor Eus- tatia! She is indeed in the power of a heart- less villain 1" "But she must not be a captive longer. I will follow the tracks now-instantly I will not delay an instant," exclaimed Norville, no longer able to control his emotions, or to-main- tain a forced calmness. "You must first see king Henry, Captain Blanchford," said Franton, laying his hand upon the shoulder of the excited young man. "The captors of Lady Eustatia have at least several hours the start of you, and one hour will make but little difference. And you must not go without informing king Henry of the cir- cumstances. " "You are right, Franton," answered Blanch- ford, after a moment's thought. "Your brain is less excited than mine, and your judgment cooler. I will see the king immediately." And springing upon his horse, he spurred the noble animal on towards the royal palace. Fran- ton also momnted his own charger, and rode more leisurely on towards the mansion of the Count de Valence, to inform its inmates of the' disappearance of'the belle of London. It was with strange feelings agitating his bosom that Norville Blanchford entered the presence of the king of England, to commani- cate to him the circumstances respecting the dis- appearance of his fair favorite, Lady Eustatia "Elive. King Henry received him pleasantly,      and requlested to know what had called him into the presence of his sovereign. "Your majesty," said Norville, "Lady Eus- tatia L'Elive has suddenly disappeared, and it is feared there has been foul play." The king gave a quick start, and turned sud- denly pale, and then a dark frown gathered upon his brow. But turning to Blanchford, he said, pleasantly: "Is that all, Captain Blanchford?" "Is not that enough,.your majesty?" asked Norville, not at all pleased by the king's words and manner. "I' faith, yes," returned king Henry, assum- ing a more' serious air; " but I thought, by your appearance, that the Alcena had come up in the night, and run away with the Con- queror." "The Conqueror is safe, your majesty," said Norville, I but the losaof Lady Iustatia touches my heart quicker than would the loss of my ves- sel." "Ah, indeed!" "The maiden is very dear to me, your majesty." "You say that she has disappeared?" "She has, your majesty." "But how 't" Norville related the incidents of Eastatia's disappearance, as far as they were known to him, and the king listened with deep interest. He knew very well that it was the work of the buc- caneer captain, .Crescelle, and he was not at all pleased that he had taken the fair belle, whom he hoped to win for himself. He now sincerely regretted his promise, that she should be placed in the power of the buccaneer, if he would but destroy the Orient--and he determined that she should, if possible, be taken from his power But he knew that the buccaneer had many re- sources for concealing his prize--and that if there was danger of detection, that the heartless captain would consign her to an ocean-grave But none of his thoughts were made known to Norville--he did not wish to trust the secret of his connexion with the buccaneer captain with any one.   "Do you suspect any one to have aLducted Lady Eustatia't" asked king Henry, as Nor- ville closed his account of her disappearance. "I have no sure proof of the guilt of any one," answered the young captain, hebitatingly. "But whom do you suspect?' "This ring, which I have found, leads me to suspect the owner," answered Norville, produc- ing the diamond ring. The king recognized it. "It is the Earl of Gcrdon's," he said, quickly. "I know it is, your majesty." *"Have you any proof, besides this ring, that he is the aggressor?" "I have none, but I feared it was his hands into which she had fallen.',' "Where was this ring found?" "On the spot where we judge that Lady Eastatia was taken prisoner. Franton, one of the servants of the Count de Valence, who was with me, picked the ring from the ground, where it was doubtless dropped by its owner, and gave it into my hands." "You knew to whom it belonged?" ' I did." "And of course suspected the Earl of Gor- don. But can you think of any reason for the deed?" "The singular beauty of Lady Eustatia had doubtless enthralled hbm, and finding he could not win her by fair means, he resorted to force to get her into his power." "Has he been suing for her hand?" "He has, your majesty." "And she has refused him?" "Firmly, your majesty." "Then it is, without doubt, the Earl of Gor- don who has been instrumental in her abduc- tion." "I have not a doubt but that he is the ag- gressor," said Norville, in a decided tone. "This must be looked into," said the king; "are you willing to undertake the lead of a search for her?" "'To the end of the earth, your majesty," returned Norville, earnestly. "I hardly think you will have to go as far ao   that, Captain Blanchford," said the king, pleas- antly, " but the search may perhaps be a toil- some one. You may appoint your lieutenant as commander in your absence, and I think he will manage the Conqueror well, as he is a good seaman and a brare man. I hardly think the Alcena will trouble you at present. Any of the pages or horses of the palace are at your disposal, to assist in bringing back the fair belle 9f London to her home. The Count de Va- lence, and several of his servants, will doubtless accompany you. Arm yourselves well, that you may not lose your own lives, in attempting the rescue. And, if it is in the power of mor- tal, bring back Lady Eustatia, and your sov- ereign will not forget your bravery." With a wave of his hand, the king dismissed Norville, who left the palace with a heart some- what lighter than he had entered it. The king had entered fully into his plans-he had order- ed him to go in s:earch of Lady Eustatia, and to briig her back if possible. The young captain did not suspect that his sovereign knew aught of her disappearance-that he was, in reality, a party to it. Again mounting his own horse, and taking with him two mounted and well-armed soldiers, he left the palace courtyard. They had not ridden far, before the Count de Valence,   Franton, and another of his servants joined them, and together the little band, six in num- ber, dashed onward to the spot where the search was to commence. "There. ia a mystery about this which I can- not fathom," said the count, addressing Cap- tain Blanchford, " what reason the Earl of Gor- don could have for abducting Eastatia, I cannot divine." "Lady Eustatia is very beautiful," returned Norville, " and her beauty was an irresistible temptation to the earl." "It may be so, Captain Blanchford," an- swered the count, "but I fear there may be some other reason." "But what?" The count guided his horse nearer Norville's, and bending his head, whispered a few words in the young man's ear. The captain started quickly, and gazed up into the face of the e count, who only made a sign of silence and se- k crecy, and the young man sank back in his sad- a dle, and gave himself up, for a few moments, L to intense thought. But he could not divine L why the king should have any agency in the L maiden's capture--but when he recollected that sudden start, paleness, and frown, his thoughts , assumed a different turn.     CHAPTER XH. THE KINO DISPLEASED AT THE ABDUCTION OF EUSTATIA-A STRANGE YISITOR-A PRIi0E.. '   "O, woman's love! at times it may, Seem cold or clouded, but it bums With-true, undeviating ray, And never from its idol turns." lOR   several moments after'Norville had departed, the king sat wrapped in deep thought   He was quite sure the young captain and his band would not discover the buccaneer's retreat, and he had determined to have Eusta- tia brought back, if possible, even should Nor- ville fail in the accomplishment of his purpose. "By my royal sceptre!" he muttered, half aloud, while a frown gathered upon his brow, "but this Creseelle is a daring fellow! I had rather he would have taken any half-dozen fine fellows in the kingdom, than to have carried off this paragon of beauty!  Couldn't he have known she wa? destined for a queen? And queen of England, too! She is far too beauti- ful to be a buccaneer's bride, and she shall not be I 'Though it is true that he rendered me a very important service in destroying the Orient, still he should not have taken Lady Eustatia as a recompense. I gave him his life, when he and several of his band were captured by my   soldiers, on condition that he -should serve me to the best of his ability, and perform whatever important services I required of him. Finding it somewhat difficult for Blanchford to capture or destroy the Orient, I gave him that as a task to accomplish, little thinking he would claim the reward I so injudiciously promised. But she must be taken from him, at all hazards, and it shall be the last I will have to do with the Span- ish buccaneer. And should I ever get the' band into my hands again, they shall hang for their crimes, and no promises shall save them. I must recover the charming belle-she must be queen of England. I have nothing to fear from Blanohford-he dare not oppose the will 6f his sovereign. Lady Eustatia knows me too well  to think she can refuse me as she would a com- mon suitor, and she would be too much daz- zled by the brilliant prospect to think of a re. fusal. And she will soon learn to love me, if she does not now. The only barrier to my hap- piness is my present queen, Catherine of Arra- gon-and as my marriage with her is not strict- ly lawful, the Duke of Buckingham asmres me   that a divorce from her can be easily obtained. This shall soon be done, and then for a queen Eustatia!" A side door slowly opened, a light step at- tracted his attention, and his wife, Catherine, entered the room. A sweet smile rested upon her countenance, but as she met the cold glance of her husband, it vanished, and an expression of pain passed   over her features. Though Catherine of Arragon, the first wife of - Henry the Eighth, had been once surpassingly beauti- ful, her charms of person had now faded, and though her appearance was still prepossessing, still her charms were not brilliant and fascinat- ing enough to satisfy such an admirer of beauty as king Henry. With pain she saw her hus- band's love cool as her beauty faded, and though she loved him most tenderly, she could not but charge him, in. her heart, with unkind- ness. Catherine was a true and noble-hearted woman, and possessed many of those brightest traits of femninje character which are so rarely found in those upon whose 'brows glitter the coronal of royalty. But to all these Henry was blind, if she possessed not what he considered the  brightest gem-surpassing beauty. Yet, though he wedded six wives, he at last confessed that Catherine of Arragon was the only one he had truly loved, or that had truly loved him. As Catherine entered the room where sat her royal husband, musing upon the singular beauty of  Eustatia Uive,  she  noticed that the frown upon his brow was darker than usual. Not suspecting the cause, but attributing it to state cares, she was somewhat surprised at the cold, silent glance which greeted her entrance. Sitting down by his side, she kissed his cheek tenderly, and said: "Are you ill, my lord?" * Not in body," returned the king, coldly, and scarcely noticing the affectionate action. "But you are in mind, my dear lord 7" asked the queen, while an expression of pain crossed her fine features as she noticed his cold man- ner. "Why do you ask, Kate?" ' That I may ooafort and .sympathize with   you, and perhaps render your cares lighter," she answered, tenderly. "You are very kind, Kate," said Henry, somewhat softened by her gentle .an  loving manner. "Those state cares oppress and occupy your mind too much, my dear husband," said Cathe- rine; " for they make you moody and thought- ful, and are writing wrinkles upon your brow." "I am king of England, Catherine," return- ed Henry; " and these state cares must occupy 'my thoughts, if I would preserve the glory which hangs around the English throne." "But has anything extraordinary transpired, that renders you so suddenly thoughtful?" "Lady Eustatia L'Elive has disappeared, and I fear she will not be found." "Impossible 1" "It is true, Kate." "But when did this transpire?" "She has not been seen since last evening." "But has no trace been found of her?" "The track of her captors has been found, and also a ring which belonged to one of them." "But who?" "The Earl of Gordon!" "Ah I the   stranger nobleman. I  never liked his look, for his eye had the appearance. of evil. But has a search been instituted for Lady Eastatia?" "A company have started to follow the track, and  I hope that they will succeed in rescuing her." "Who brought you the news?" "Norville Blanchford." "Ah I her lover. He is a noble young man, and I hope Lady Eustatia will be found, for his sake, as he would be utterly miserable without her. Those two hearts are evidently destined for each  other, and nought but death should part them." Catherine knew not that every word she spoke, carried disquietude to her husband's heart. But she suspected not the tenor of his thoughts-- well for her that she did not l "Lady Eustatia is surpassingly beautiful," said the king; "I never saw her equal in love- iness."'     "She is very lovely,"' answered Queen Cath- erine, sighing, as she remembered her own brilliant charms, which had so completely fas- cinated her husband, when a young and ardent prince. "But," she continued, 'time will fade her almost wonderful beauty, as well as it has mine." "s You were once almost as lovely as Lady Eustatia, Kate," answered Henry, slowly, " but your personal charms have, in a degree, faded., "' But my love for thee, my dear lord, has not changed," exclaimed the queen, throwing her arms around his neck, and kissing him ten- derly. "Yes, Henry," she continued, pas- sionoaely, "I love you as deeply and tenderly as when my beauty first won thy heart!" The king was deeply moved, and throwing his arm around the graceful waist of his wife, he drew her closer to his bosom, and pressed his lips to her brow. He could not shut out from his heart the consciousness that he loved her, in spite of her faded charms. "There, dear Kate," said he, tenderly, and unclasping her arms from his neck, "4 you must retire to your rooms, for I would be alone. I have much to think of, and your presence can- not aid me." The queen arose, and giving her husband a smile and a glance of undying affection, she left the room, closing the carved door behind her. Poor Queen Catherine! Little did she know what had been passing in the mind of Henry respecting her t For several moments after his wife had de- parted, the king remained absorbed in thought. He loved his queen--that he could not deny. But Eustatia's surpassing beauty had enthralled him-her charms were far more powerful than his affection for his wife, and he determined she should yet be his consort-the Queen of Eng. land.' A slight noise started him, and turning, he beheld what had blanched the cheek of many a braver man. There, calm and silent, full be- fore him, stood the sybil of the cliffl  A strange thrill passed over the frame of king Henry, as he gazed at the strange woman before   him. He had seen her before, and though he had never heard her voice, still it seemed to him as if he had known her well. Her dark, spark- ling eyes were fixea upon him, and, in their fearfully brilliant depths, he seemed to read a confirmation of her supernatural powers. "King Henry of England," said the sybil, in her deep, mystical tones, ' you see me here before you. Would you wish to ask aught of her who sees the secrets of the future?" "I have naught to ask of thee, sorceress," answered Henry, with a spice of haughtiness in his tone. "Ahl not even -of Lady Eustatia?" asked the sybil, fixing her ipenetrating eyes upon the king. He started, and gazed quickly at her. She smiled scornfully. "I thought her name would startle you," said the strange woman. "She is very beauti- ful-but you cannot wed her. She will not give her hand even to a king, for the one she loves is the only one that can possess her." "Sorceress," said the king, sternly, "what right have you in the royal palace?" "The sybil of the cliff questions no one as to where she has a right," answered the strange visitor. "But the royal palace should be safe from your intrusion," said Henry, his eyes kindling' with anger. "The king's palace is the same to me as the peasant's hut. I go, unseen, but feared, into both, and no mortal knows how, or why. I hear much which you wot not of, king Henry, and which you would fear to have many know." "Do you speak thus to me-to the king of , England?" exclaimed Henry, his eyes glitter-; ing still brighter as he listened to the sybil. "I do not fear you, king Henry," said the sybil, with a slight touch of scorn in her tone. "You cannot harm me." "Tell me, sorceress," said the king, control- ling his anger, "for  what you  aue in my presence?" "Wod you BOw? '   "I would, truly." "It is in reference to Lady Eastatia, that I shall speak." "Speak on, then," said Henry, a strange fear that she knew all crossing his mind. He had always felt a suspicion that the prevailing opinion respecting the sybil of the cliffwas true, that she possessed supernatural powers that but few other mortals ever dared to claim. If this was true, he was quite sure she was ac- quainted with his designs respecting Lady Eus-l tatia. "King Henry of England," pursued the sybil, A do you indeed intend, if Lady Eustatia is recovered from the power of her captors, to make her your queen, provided a divorce from Catherine should be granted you?" ',' I shall answer no questions, proud sybil,"  returned Henry, haughtily. "You need not," said the woman, with a scornful smile. "I know your intentions well. But Catherine-you cannot deny that you love her?" "I shall answer none of your questions, rest assured, proud sorceress," answered Henry; "I do not fear you; your pretensions have no effect upon me." "That does not make them the less true," returned the sybil. "I have power-power that you know not of. Woulal-you have it known to all your subjects, that you *knew of the abduction of Eastatias--that you promised her person as the reward of the destruction of the Orient?" The king did not reply. "Ah, king Henry," continued the sybil, "you perceive that I hold the keys of your des- tiny in my hands; I know of your connexion with Alverne d'Crescelle, I know that it was he that destroyed the Orient, but that you com- manded him to do it-and promised him, as a reward, what you have no right to give-Lady Eastatia as a bride. -And then 'you regretted the promise-not that remorse at the cruelty and injustice of the action stung you, but to gratify your own desires-to make the brilliant and wondrously beautiful belle your queen--to share   with you the throne of England I But you can never accomplish your object-Eustatia must be found, but she cannot be yours. I have sworn it-and I never speak in vain. Her peer- less beauty is not for you-her hand is destined for the one who has ahlready won her heart. She shall not be yours-neither shall the buc- caneer possess her." "Dare you thus insult your sovereign?" cried the king, in a voice hoarse with anger and passion. "You shall rue the words you have thus spoken!" "Dare you deny what I have said?" return- ed the sybil, in a deep, stern voice. "Deny it or not, fiend in human shape, know that I scorn your arts, add fear neither your knowledge of the present nor the future 1" "Nor of the past, king Henry of England i! I know the past, ha, ha, ha!" answered the sybil, with a meaning laugh of scornful bitter- ness. The fearless Epirit of Henry Seventh rose in the bosom of his son. With the quickness of lightning he sprang towards the sybil, and clasping his jewelled fingers tightly around her throat, he pressed them closer-tighter, until her face became scarlet-then purple, and then succeeded the fearful death-rattle 1 The strange woman's vaunted powers were useless-she was utterly powerless! The fingers of the king relaxed-his anger had been partly spent, and taking his hands from the throat of the sybil, he cast her from him. Then regarding her with a scornful smile, he folded his arms and stood proudly in the centre of the room. The sybil bowed her head upon a rich cushion, until she had recovered her self-possession, and as she rose to her feet, all traces of the fearful struggle. had passed away from her countenance, and her throat, which was covered with the dark mantle, alone would tell tthe story. She stood erect before the in- censed king, the same scornful smile upon her curved lips. "Which has the most power now, proud sybil?" said Henry, in a tone of irony. ' I ' might have killed you, but I scorned to take     the life of such a despicable being. Know now, that Henry of Engla endures insult from no one."  "I My power over thee is no greater than be- fore," returned the sybil, 'inm"h ght y tone. "I can testify to most unheard of brutality, as well as treachery and falsity to your subjects. Your diadem shall not protect you, Henry of England!" "Beware!" returned the king; " your life is not yet safe I provo ke my vengeance farther at your peril!" "I fear you not "   said the sybil, scorn- fully. The king grasped a small silver bell which lay upon the table, and rang it loudly. A mo- ment of silence elapsed, and six soldiers, armed to the teeth, entered the room.  The king pointed to the sybil, and said, authoritatively:   "Arrest that woman! Convey her to the cell called the Asuco dungeon, and secure the door with double bars! If she escapes, it will be at your peril 1" The soldiers saw that the king was in no mood to be trifled with, and approaching the sybil, who offered no resistance, they took her prisoner. Ere another moment had passed, irons were placed upon her wrists, and she was led from the room. As-she passed the incensed monarch, she whispered, meaningly, "I am not yet con- quered!" The dark, fearful cell known as the Asuco  dungeon, soon had an occupant--in the person of the sybil of the cliff    CHAPTER X1V. THE BYBIL*S MEDITATIONS-TIlE ESCAPE--THE DIAMOND BRACELET.   "The star of the unconquered will, It rises in my breast- Serene, and resolute, and still, And calm, and self-possessed." HE Asuco dungeon was the darkest And T  strongest cell of the prison, and only the deepest-dyed criminals were imprisoned within its cheerless walls. As the sybil had incurred the deep displeasure of the king, he had order- ed her to be remanded to this dungeon, not'fear- ing her escape from it. A dim lamp was stuck in a niche of the rough wall, which only serv- ed to render the appearance of the cell even more fearful. On the cold, rough stone floor sat the sybil, with her head leaning upon her hand, and her long gray hair almost concealing her features. Yet there was an expression-not of fear, not of despair, or anger, upon those proud features- but one of triumpli, and of haughty scorn! "Ay," she muttered, half audibly, while a proud smile played over her countenance, "I shall foil him yet! I know a secret respecting this dark cell, which even the king of England does not know--and which shall serve me well! Buat he did come near conquering me, it is true I IMy pride was wounded to the quick, and I must not soon forget it. But it should not   have occurred had I suspected it, for I would have sprang from him, and left the room by the secret side door. He ' fears me not-at least when he is angry. My style, appearance, and bearing and assumption of power have no effect upon him, the events of to-day have shown. But I must away--there is one who needs my aid-if any aid I can give. This cell must no longer have an occupant-surely not in the per- son of the sybil of the cliff. I must maintain this character for a time longer-at least, until more favorable circumstances for a disclosure present themselves." She arose, and going to the lamp, drew from her bosom a miniature, richly set with jewels, and to which was attached a splendid chain of gold 'and diamonds. It was the likeness of a young and remarkably   handsome man, richly dressed, and with an air of decided nobleness upon his fine features. As the sybil gazd upon that pictured countenance, her own face assum- ed a softer, tenderer expression-tears dimmed her eyes and fell upon the miniature. She gazed long and earnestly at it-then replaced it in her bosom, and re-arranging her disordered mantle, she turned to another portion of the cell. ' Placing her finger within a small niche in the     wall that would not have been noticed by a common observer, she pressed it againit a secret spring, and one of the rough stones which com- posed the wall slowly moved aside, disclosing an aperture large enough for the exit of the sybil. She then took the dim lamp in her hand, -and passing through the aperture, drew'the stone back to its place again.  She then passed through a long, damp passage, up a flight of irregular stone steps, and opening a trap-door at the top, found herself once more free. She closed the trap carefully after her, replaced the leaves and earth which concealed it from obser- vation, and extinguishing the light, threw it upon the ground. A fine horse stood near, as if waiting for its rider, and the sybil decided to appropriate it to her own use for a time, as there was no other alternative. She sprang upon the handsome animal, and drawing her mantle closer around her, dashed off at an al- most dangerous speed. We will again return to the party which we left commencing the search for Lady Eustatia. They had already reached the spot where Fran- ton had recognized the track of his mistress's charger, and were debating as to the utility of retaining the whole band to pursue the search in that narrow pathway. "The captors of Lady Eustatia may be many and well-armed," said Norville, ," and I think it much the best to retain the whole band. There are but six of us,; and I think none too many." "You are right, Captain Blanchford," said the Count de Valence. "You are a better judge in such matters than myself.,' "  Btit," said Franton, " who is going to be leader of the search?" All unanimously suggested Captain Blanch- ford. Giving his horse a word of command, Norville first entered the footpath, and ordered his companions to follow, as close as possible in the rear. The Count de Valence immediately followed the leader, while the king's soldiers, well armed and prepared for any encounter, brought up the rear. They rode on at a brisk  pace, for the tracks of the four horses were very   L deeply impressed, and Franton, who rode by the side of Norville, could easily distinguish the peculiar track of Lady Eustatia's charger. For some time all rode on in silence. The Count de Valence and Norville were absorbed in their own reflections, which were far from pleasant, while Franton was very busily enga- ged in reconnoitering the rough, rocky scenery around, and examining the tracks which they were following. The soldiers and remaining servant, not finding anything congenial to their tastes to converse about, were thus silent, mere- ly following their companions to guard against a surprise. "I'm quite sure, Captain Blanchford," said Franton, who had been attentively examining the tracks as they passed along, " that the horse which brought up the rear was riderless., The tracks are more irregular and careless than those of the others, and see, it does not follow the path entirely, but walks upon the side, as if without a guide to direct it." "You are right, Franton," said Norville, after a moment's observation. "Thea we should of course judge that there were but two of Lady Eustatia's captors, but how  many more there were at their rendezvous, we cannot tell." "There is doubtless more of them," remark- ed one of the soldiers, " and I think we shall yet meet with a desperate encounter before Lady Eastatia is recovered."' "And we are prepartd for it," remarked the other soldier. "We ftght for the life and- lib- erty of one who well deserves our heart's best blood, even though she be of a nation who is our sworn foe." "Nobly spoken, my brave friend," exclaim. ed Norville.  "I do not fear for the result of the encounter, with such arms as yours to aid me!" The ground of the path now became harder and more rocky, and consequently, the tracks were much less deeply impressed. The pro- gress of the little band was now' much slower, though, as yet, they had experienced no seri- ous diffieilty in following the trail. The path became narrower, and more rugged, until t0-   adventurers at last found it necessary to follow it in single file. "Ah, what's this?"  exclaimed the ever- watchful Franton, springing from his saddle, and picking something from the ground which glittered in the sunlight, as it fell upon it. "D'ye recognize this, Captain Blanchford?" continued he, giving the article, which was a small diamond bracelet, into the eager hand of Norville. "It is Eustatia's bracelet?" exclaimed the young captain, pressing it to his lips. "It was my own gift, but it has been hallowed by her wearing it." The bracelet was a small, delicate ornament, and upon the golden clasp the names of "Eus- tatia " and "Norville " were curiously blended together, and encircled with a delicately wrought wreath of flowers. It. had been accidentally unclasped from the wrist of its fair wearer, when the buccaneer had unbound her hands, and neither had been aware of the loss. Norville placed the precious ornament in his bosom, and again they rode on in silence. The track, which had been gradually becom- ing fainter, was now so faintly impressed, that it scarcely afforded any guide to the devoted little band. But they still followed the foot- path, and the quick eyes of Franton and Nor- ville occasionally detected the tracks of horses' feet, and sometimes those of Euptatia's charger' by which means they knew that they were fol- lowing in the right road to overtake the captors of the maiden, if it were possible to overtake them in any manner. At length they reached the huge rock which Eustatia's charger had leaped, when she first attempted to escape from the power of her cap- tors. They rode a short distance past it, when the eye of the experienced Franton detected the fact that the track which they had been follow- ing no longer led in that direction. Dismount- ing from his horse, he carefully examined the path. No sign-of a track of any kind was to be found, for when the buccaneer had passed from the rendezvous to the city onh his visit to the king, he had taken another path, as also   had De Grancelon with the horses.  Franton was puzzled, as also were the count and Nor- ville. The search was almost hopeless-yet no one thought of giving it up, until the fair maiden was found. "We are wrong, Captain Blanchford," said Franton, decidedly, " for Lillie's foot has never trod this path. I am quite sure I saw her track but a few moments since, and I will go back until I find it." And the faithful servitor retraced his steps, the remainder of the band following. When he had reached the huge rock once more, he earn- estly examined the tracks before it for a moment, and then rose with an expression of satihfaction upon his features. "T*s is Lillie's peculiar track,". he said, pleasantly.. "But it is evident that the cap- tors of Lady Eustatia did not follow the pAth farther than this spot. What course they took front here, is yet to be ascertained, but it is use- less to follow the path longer, though their track can, I think, be easily found." But it was impossible to find a footstep of any kind, in any direction save the one they had come, and even Frantoa looked puzzled and almost despairing. "There is a mystery here," said the Count de Valence. ^E^l o  ne'o thh I cannot fathom," returned one of the soldiers. But Norville stood by, and though silent, he was not idle.  Neither was the indefatigable Franton, for both were closely examining the tracks of the horses, which wore quite deeply impressed upon the ground opposite the large rock.  At length Norville arose, and said, calmly: "I think we have fathomed the mystery." "How'?" simultaneously exclaimed every voice save Franton's. "The track of Lady Eustatia's captors lays over this!" he said, pointing to the rook in , front of them. "Impossible!" exclaimed   the Count de Valence. "It is true," returned Norville. "If you     will but examine the footprints of the horses, which are impressed here, I think they will sat- isfy you that I am right." "Captain Blanohford is right," kaid Franton; "the track lays over this formidable barrier. Who will be the first to pass it?" "I will lead the way," returned Norville, firmly. "This stratagem was doubtless used to foil us; but we will conquer yet." He placed his horse in front of the barrier, then giving him a word of command, planted himself firmly in the saddle, and drew the rein tightly, preparatory to the dangerous leap. The animal reared his head fiercely, but seemed de- termined not to obey his master. All Norville's efforts were in vain. "Spiritless animal!" cried Norville, angrily, as he sprang from the saddle. "Give me your horse, count, and I will try his mettle ;" and in another moment the young captain was mounted upon the splendid black charger of the Count de Valence, who was champing his bits with impatience.   Norville gave the word of rom- mand-the spirited  animal reared his fore feet high in air, and in another moment both horse and rider were landed safely upon the green sward at the other side of the huge barrier! The count leaped upon the horse which Nor- ville had left behind, which now showed no dis- position to disobey, and in another moment he stood by the side of Captain Blanchford. The others quickly followed, and at last all had leaped. the formidable barrier. "Ah, here's Lillie's track," cried Franton, quiokly; " it is pretty deeply impressed, and the others are also. We shall foil them yet, captain " "And soon too, I  hope, good Franton. But this track is so deeply impressed, we can ride on at a  very brisk pace, and without difficulty." For some   time they rode on in silence. At length the watchful Franton exclaimed: "This was a chase, captain I Lady Eustatia. endeavored to escape from them, and how know we but what she has succeeded?" "What mean you, Fraiton??"   cried Nor- ville.   ' That Lady Eustatia endeavored to escape from her captors, and has perhaps succeeded!" "How know you that?" "These tracks tell that there has been a race here, and as Lilhe was a swift charger, I have some hope that Lady Eastatia may have es- caped!", "Then let us press on, as fast as possible," said the Count de Valence. "I am all anxiety to know the fate of one who was so dear to me."  "I am burning with impatience," muttered Norville, spurring on his handsome charger. The track, which was now perfectly plain,'could be followed without difficulty, and the eager party pressed briskly on. For some time they rode on without interruption, when all suddenly stopped, surprised and wondering, before an object which met their eyes as they emerged into a more open and uneven part of the path. There, full before them, lay the dead charger of Lady Eustatia, just as it had been left the night before. A vulture was circling in the air above it, preparing to descend to make a feast upon the body of the noble animal. "Poor Lillie!" said Franton, -who was the first to speak, " in trying to escape with her mistress, she lost her own life." "The villains must have shot her," said the count, "for she would outrun any common horse, in a fair race." "No," said Franton; "the faithful animal must have died of exhaustion. Her swollen chest, glaring eyes, and the appearance of her mouth, indicate this. But where is Lady Eus- tatia?" This was a question which none of the party found themselves able to answer. The tracks of the three other horses were found leading from the spot, and as Franton declared that the horse which had before been riderless, now ap- peared to have been guided by a rider, all con- eluded it was doubtless the fair captive, Lady Eustatia. Just as they were again forming into order to pursue the search, the head of another horse appeared from a different direction, and the sybil of the clff was added to their party I   CHAPTER XV. THi EARL OF GORDON 8 VILLANY UNASEIED---ARRIVAL AT THE BUCOANEERB' RENDEZVOUS.   "Light to regain the track,  Y Lost for awhile mid those that downward tend, Strength to press onward, bravely onward, lend- Till faith and hope triumphantly shall blend, Ne'er to turn faltering back!" OR several moments the little party gazed upon the now-comer in unfeigned surprise. She noticed it, and with a pleasant smile, said calmly: "You need not fear me, good friends, for I have but come to assist you in the search. I take a deep interest in the fate of the maiden, and would fain accompany you in the search for her." -"You are welcome, good sybil," said Nor- ville, pleasantly; " you are cunning and fear- lessi and may be of much service to us. You will be no mean addition to our band." "Do you know by whom Lady Eustatia has been taken, Captain Blanchford?" said the sybil, in a low tone, as she guided her horse nearer the side of Norville's. "I have suspicions of the -Earl of Gordon," returned the young man. "But do you know that the Earl of Gordon   was but a villain in disguise?" asled the sybil. "I know he is a villain!" said Norville, while his eyes flashed fire. "But are you aware that beneath the dis- guise of the Earl of Gordon, lurks the Spanish buccaneer, Captain Creseelle?" "Impossible l" exclaimed Norville. "It is quite possible, Captain Blanohford. A nd it is true, Norville I I know it to be so." "Do not deceive me, woman, as you value your own life 1" cried Norville, almost wildly, as he grasped the arm of the sybil. "I have not deceived you, Captain Blanoh- ford  Every word that I have told you is strictly true!" answered the sybil, earnestly. "O, God, into what hands has my Eustatia fallen!" exclaimed the young and noble lover, in a tone of almost hopeless anguish. "Norville Blanchford," said the sybil, lay- ing her hand calmly upon the arm of the young man, and speaking slowly and impressively; "remember your duty now, and do not give way to useless grief. Your loved Etistatia may yet be found, if you but put your whole heart and     hand to the enterprise, and cast this despond- ing agony from you It can do no good--and it may do harm. I did not tell you this to depress your spirits and render you more hopeless, but that you might know your position, and the true danger of your beloved. It will be best to keep this fact a secret from the remainder of be party, it may intimidate some, and surely cannot raise the spirits of any. Do not despair, Captain Blanchford, for if you falter, Eustatia is lost. Keep courage-look forward to a happy meet, ing with your beloved, and think that upon your exertions rests her happiness or misery, her life or death!" "Noble woman!" exclaimed Norville, while a smile of hope brightened his features, and the fire of determination flashed from his fine eyes. "I will obey you I  I will keep courage, and save my beloved Eastatia! But how, strange esybil, did you come into possession of the start- ling information which you imparted to me but a few moments since?" *"It matters not now how I received it," re- turned the  sybil; ( suffice it that it is true. There is a mystery which now envelopes all my actions, but which, ere many days are spent, will be fully solved. You shall know all, Nor- ville, in good time." "I   will trust to your words, good sybil,"  said Norville, as he gazed wonderingly at the countenance of the strange woman before him. There was a mystery about her, which, with all his penetration, he could not fathom, yet he felt that her purposes respecting him could be actu- ated by no evil motive. The sybil now made a motion of silence to her companion, and checkingher horse for a moment, she fell back into the rear of the party, while Captain Blanchford led the way. The Count -de Valence, who had been very much puzzled respecting the nature of the communication the sybil had made to Norville, now followed by the side of the captain, and, as he showed no dis- position to converse, both relapsed into silence. Franton was moody and thoughtful, for, as he had no longer Lillie'd peculiar traok to guide him, he considered the aspect of things rather   darker than before, and the chances of finding Lady Eustatia as being considerably lessened. But not so with Norville. The cheering, hopeful words of the sybil of the cliff, in spite of the depressing information she had given him, coupled with the solemn injuinction to press fear- lessly forward, had given his spirits a different tone, as wh as a firmer determination to rescue Eustatia, even at the expense of his own life. Norville Blanchford was a brave man; he had faced danger in many forms, and was not to be intimidated now, even though the peril might be greater than any he had ever before undergone. The track of the three horses was quite plain, and though the path which they followed was very irregular, the devoted band found but lit- tle difficulty in following it safely.  Norville led the van, and his quick eye detected any circumstance that might contribute to the fur- therance of their enterprise. SFranton was eon- stantly examining the footprints of the horses, and quickly detected any deviation from the path. "Ah, this is the old footpath again," said the Count de Valence, as they emerged into the path wlich the captors of Lady  Eustatia had first taken, but from which her escape had turn- ed them for a time. The cause of this devia- tion which was unknown to the little party, now formea the subject of a lively conversation be- tween the soldiers and Franton, which was kept up until they reached the hut. Here all stopped, and dismounted from their horses. They entered the hut, and it was evi- dent to all, both from its outer and interior ar- rangoments, that it was constructed merely as a shelter for a  very short time. No traces of Lady Eustatia or of her captors were there found, but there were tracks of horses' feMt in every direction, and it was somewhat difficult to again find the path which had been taken by those for whom they were searching. "  Another fellow joined them here, captain," said Franton, "  for here are the tracks of four horses, and all of them, I  thiniwith riders. One was my fair mistress, Lady Eustatia, and the other three are the rascals who have done   this business. It seems there was another. waiting for them here, and that confirms what i I have before suspected-that it was all a stud- ied plot to take her!"  "Franton is right," said the sybil, approach- E ing Norville, and speaking in a low tone. "It i was a studied plot. But yet I hope that we I shall foil them-I am quite sure that we shall! Lady Eustatia mnst be rescued, if it is in the power of mortal!" "She shall be," said Norville, firmly. The party again mounted their horses, ,and rode briskly on. The sghil rode by the side of Norville, while Franton and the Count de Va- lence followed immediately behind, the soldier and the remaining servant bringing up the rear. For some time all were silent, when Norville, guiding his horse nearer that of the sybil, said calmly: "I fear, good sybil, that this search is yet to be more difficult than -all of us imagine." "Why?" asled the sybil, inquiringly.. "The ocean- is trackless," returned the young man, his handsome countenance becoming a shade paler as he spoke;- " and, though I never passed this path before, I am sure that it leads towards the sefaside. If the captor of Lady Eas- tatia is, indeed, as you have said, the buccaneer Crescelle, she is, ere now, bounding over the trackless ocean!" A shade of perplexity passed over the usually calm countenance of the sybil. Though she had feared that what Norville said was true, still, she had cherished a hope that they had a tempo-  rary rendezvous upon the shores of England, where they might remain concealed a short time, before leaving for their mountain cave upon the shore of Spain. But that hope now became still fainter, for the suspicion which Norville also cherished seemed to confirm her fears. "- But," said the strange woman, fixing her aearching eyes upon the young man's counte- nance, " should it prove that Eustatia is already upon the ocean, what course shall you then pursue?" "I will scour the ocean in every direction, till she is found," returned the young -man, firmly.   ". Nobly spoken!" exclaimed the ybil. "I do not fear for my-" But she suddenly checked herself, anl as Norville said no more, both soon relapsed into silence. They rode on some distance farther, when the Count de Valence, guiding his horse by the side of Norville's, said anxiously: "I think, Captain Blanchford, that this path will end by the seaside, and from there, captain, our path is trackless!" "I know it, count," returned Norville, calm- ly, "but even there, I do nothitaakto give up the search. The Conqueror is a fast-sailing ves- sel, and will outstrip any common craft." "But the king-will he grant you permission to go?" 1anxiously- questioned the count. "He cannot deny me.   And he alvo is very anxious to recover Lady Eustatia." A portion of the despairing shadow left the brow of the Count de Valence, as he listened to the decided words of the noble young captain. He fult a deep interest in the fate of his fair ward, Lady Eustatia L'Elive, and with such as Norville Blanchford to aid him in the enterprise, he hoped that she might yet be recovered from her heartless captors.  , For about an hour the party continued  on, when, as they suddenly turned a curve in the path, they saw the blue waters of the cove spread out before them, at the distance of not moro than half a mile. All reined up for a moment, to gaze upon the scene, but at the word of com- mand from Norville, again started on, but with 'different feelings than before. A firmer deter- mination was expressed in the countenances of the sybil, Blanohford, and the Count deValence, while the remainder of the party looked depress- ed and almost hopeless. A  ride of a very few moments brought them to the shore of the cove, where the track ended, and it was perfectly evident to all, that the chase must henceforth be upon the water. No sign of a craft of any kind was visible, and save the occasional soreams of the sea-birds which were ,wheeling around, all presented the calm silence of unbroken nature. The whole band dismountel from their horses, and stood silently around, awaiting the orders of their captain.     "This is a dark prospect, Captaih Blanch- ford," said the Count de Valence, who was the first to break the silence which had reigned since they had dismounted. "Ay, dark enough," said Franton, who was not at all pleased by the turn affairs had taken. "Captain Blanohford," said one of the sol- diers, " can you inform us what course to take now?" "Pursue the search, of course," returned Norville, calmly. "But how? the sea, you know, is trackless, and it will be very difficult to judge what course to take." Norvillb was in a dilemma. His heart al- most sank within him, for the full realization of his situation flashed upon him. "Hooray, Captain Blanchford, 's that ye?" cried a strange voice, which made all start and turn round to see who was the- new-comer "Glad to see ye," continued the stranger, " be ye huntin' for Lady 'Statia?" The new-comer was the most curious speci- men of the " genus homo " most of the party had ever seen. Even at that time, none of the party could refrain from laughing heartily at his appearance. He might have been some- where between the ages of sixteen and sixty, though  it would have puzzled the "cutest" chap in Christendom to tell where. He was built entirely upon the long principle, for his arms, legs, neck, chin, nose and hair were de- cidedly long, and gave him  somewhat the ap- pearance of an orang-outang, and, at first, the astonished party had some suspicions as to wheth- er the curious stranger was not one; but the ,reflection that those monkeyish chaps didn't live in England, dispelled all suppositions on i that score. Besides, the queer fellow could' talk, and was dressed, and of course his monkey- I ship wouldn't be.              I The hair of the odd looking stranger, which somewhat resembled a  bunch of tow, both in E fineness and color, might have been combed once a  year, but it was very doubtful. But his c eyes were the queerest part of all the queer i features of this very queer personage, They   - were of a greenish-gray color, exceedingly small, e but fiery and restless, and with a peeuliar squint I about them, that, independent of his other fea- tures and peculiarities, would cause an observer s to laugh outright. There was a curious ex- pression in the whole appearance of his counte. - nance, that indicated good-humor, and not a lit- e tie acuteness and cunning. He was dressed in the style of a fisherman, with short duck trousers, I a ragged waistcoat, and a " shocking bad hat," if hat it could be called at all. 'the company were so surprised at the extra- 1 3 ordinary appearance of the stranger, that they had not noticed what he had said. Franton, who was the only one of the whole company to whom the fellow was known, immediately ac- quainted Norville that he was a fisherman who lived but a short distance from that place, and that he might possibly give them  some intelli- gence of Lady Eustatia. Norville's countenance brightened not a little at this intelligence, and approaching tthe fellow, who stood perfectly un- concerned amid all their laughter, he said, pleasantly: "My good fellow, can you give us intelligence of any persons who have been here since nine last evening?" "Me a good fellow!" returned the other, with a provoking evasion of the question, doubt- less intended to repay them for laughing at him. "Why, Cap'n Blanchford, I guess you don't know me. But I know you, jest as well 'as I know my old grandame, an' you orter know me. Why, I'm Jerry Jenkins, an' I lives jest over the hill, an' fishes for a livin'. O, you axed me suthin', I b'lieve; what was't?" "I wished to know if you have seen any per- sons about here since nine last evening?" an- swered Norville, who, anxious as he was res- peCting the fate of his beloved, could scarcely refrain from laughing at the fellow. "D'ye mean Lady 'Statia?" asked Jerry, squinting terribly. "Can you tell me anything of her?" ex:- claimed Norville, springing forward, and grs ing the fisherman by the arm. "Don't be 'n a hurry, oap'n," said the pro.   vokingly cool fellow, " an' let go o' my arm, for you kinder hurt it." Norville complied. "I s'pose you'd like ter hear suthin' 'bout Lady 'Statia, wouldn't ye, cap'n?" continued Jerry. "Anything-any intelligence respecting her would be of incalculable importance to me," returned the young man, eagerly. "Wall, I don't 'zactly understand yer long words, but I tinder s'pose you'd like tcr hear suthin' 'bout 'er. Wall, I kin tell ye a good deal 'bout 'er, if ye'd like ter know. I guess I kin help you to find 'er. Will ye give me a sovereign if I'll tell ye all I know'?" "Yes, and pay you in advance, too, if you will give me the information immediately," an- swered Norville. "That means right off, don't it?" asked the provoking fellow, though he knew perfectly well what it. meant. "To be sure it does, Jerry," said the impa- tient Franton, " tell us quick, and I'll give you another sovereign." "Wall, give it to me 7owty," answered Jerry; "an' by Jupiter, I'll tell ye." "But you will be sure and bear in mind that you must tell us nothing but the truth," said the Count de Valence. "I'll. answer for Jerry as to that," said Franton, quickly.. "I know him well. He will tell us nothing but what is true. But get ready to tell us, sometime before next week, Jerry!" "Yes, Jerry, we are impatient!" cried the count.  "I command you, fellow," said the sybil. sternly, " that if you can tell us aught of Lady Eustatia, to tell us immediately." Jerry looked up, as if he had just observed that there was a woman in the company, and after scanning her face for a moment or two, with an a wjful squint, he muttered, loud enough to be heard by all--"Fine-loolkin' old gal, by thunder!" The sovereigns were at last stowed comfort- ably away in Jerry's capacious pocket, and   settling himself down upon a large flat rock, and scratching his head vigorously for a moment, be began: "Wall, gentlemans an' ladies, in the fust place, I must go back to day afore yesterday. I was out a fishin' that day, -jest a little ways from here, an' I hadn't been out more'n half an hour, when I seed suthin' black a comin' up the cove, an' I kept watchin' it, cos I kinder wanted to know what it was. It kept on a growin' bigger 'n bigger, and I seed it was a ship, all in fall sail, a oomin' up the cove. I thought as maybe 'twould be best to git up into the bushes, and not let 'em see me till I'd found out what kind o' flag they histed. So I got my boat on shore mighty quick, I tell ye, an' got hid nicely. She was a tarnal fine-lookin' brig- antine, all. full o' men, dressed up in red an' blue, and some on 'em had their faces half covered up with hair. They was the most fero- ciousest lookin' set o' critters I ever seed in all my life. They dropped anchor, an' purty soon three on 'em  coned ashore (darned handsome fellers they was), an' went over the hill, there, an' purty soon  they comed back, all on 'em mounted on tarnal handsome horses. Then they tooked that path," pointing to the way which Norville had come, "and I didn't Fee nothn' of 'em till last night, but a little while after they went off, another young feller follered on afoot. I waited till dark, an' then crept out o' the bushes an' went home.  I was kinder afraid of the critters, cos they did look so savage, an' I thought I'd keep out o' their way.  I told gandame all about it, and she told me ter watch 'em, cos they warnt here for anythin' but mis- chief, but ter keep out o' their way. They wan all dreadful still an' orderly in the vetsel, and a feller with a great long shinin' knife in his hand, walked the deck all day long. Yester- ,day afternoon, the young feller that follered on arter the others afoot, comed back, an' told 'em somethin', I s'pose, for all ter onet they was dreadful busy, and I thought they was a goin' off; but they didn't. But I guessed suthin' was a comin', and so I watched 'em pfcolose. 'Bout two o'clock in the mornin', lat night, I * 0     seedl the three fellers a comin' back, an' they had somebody with 'em, all kivered up with a cloak. I know'd suthin' was wrong, an' so I got as close as I could to 'em, without their seein' me. I seed the one they had with 'em was a lady, and I know'd there was some mis chief afoot. They took her off the horse, and was a g.:in' to carry her on board the ship, when she tried to git away so that the cloak fell off. I'd seen Lady 'Statia, an' I know'd in a minnit 'twas her, an' I was mad -I was! I know'd 'twould make you feel orfal bad, an' all the rest on 'em too, to have Lady 'Statia carried off, and I thought I'd do the best I could ter help yer find 'cr. Jest as soon as they got 'er on board, they picked up their, anchor an' run. I run up ter the top o' that high hill, an' I watched 'er till she was out o' sight. She went south, I seed, an' headed jest as though she wa3 bound for the Bay of Biscay. So, Cap'n Blanchford, ye sees that they've cut an' run with 'cr in earnest. I was a goin' to go an' tell ye all about it right straight off, but grandame said I'd better wait, for she know'd you'd foi- ler their track, an' be along here afore night. So ye've come, an' I've told ye the story." ' Can you describe the vessel?" said Nor- ville, upon whose brow the perspiration stood in large drops. I*Sartinly. Her hull was painted black, with a stripe of rod, an' looked as smooth an' dew as if jest done. She didn't carry any flag, nor any Aign by which I could tell her nation. She was an atljired handsome craft, an' sailed like a regular racer. I should know her in a   minnit--as soon as I sot eyes on her, if she was ever so fur off." "You say she sailed south?"  asked the Count de Valence. "Sartinly." "Could you accompany us on a chase after that essel?" said Norville, earnestly, address- ing Jerry, who, considerably excited by his own narrative, had risen from his seat, and looked as interested about the matter as any of them. " artinly-I'll go, if you want I should," he answered, eagerly. "We can hardly do without you," said Nor- ville, "* for if we overhaul the vessel, we shall want you to testify to her identity." "But we shall wish you to return to London with us now," said the Count de Valence. "Yes," added Norville, " for we shall wish to get mWe vessel, the Conqueror under way, and everything in good trim, by sunrise, to-morrow morning. We shall wiahyou to return with us, of course. " "Wall, you wait here, an' I'll go an' tell grandame I'm going, so she wont fret about me." "He is a strange being," thought Norville, as Jerry started away with the swiftness of a deer, to inform his ( grandame " of the intend- ed enterprise. He soon returned, and spring- ing upon Norville's horse, behind the young captain, all started off for London in excellent spirits. They arrived safely, and after obtain- ing the consent of the king, Norville left the palace to prepare the Conqueror for the en- terprise.   CHAPTER XVI. 'qtE CONQUEROR..

Almost before his bright beams tinged the wa- ters with their brilliant radiance, the noble Con- queror was bounding over the ocean on her southern course, in chase of the buccaneer brig- antine. Ah, it is a beautiful scene I That splendid vessel, with her white sails fluttering' in the light fresh sea-breeze, dashing onward over the waves which the glorious king of day has just brightened with his sunny light, render- irg still deeper their own bright azure-calm, still, and silent, yet sublimely beautiful I Walking the deck, with the shadow of a deep anguish resting upon his noble brow, was the young commander, Captain Blanchford. That broad, swelling brow was verfpale-- nguish of heart had faded the color from the cheek, and left there, also, a deadly pallor. But the large dark eyes were flashing brilliantly with the fire 6     6    'of spirit and determination, and the finely out lips showed the same expression of fearless deci- sion. His step was quick and almost impatient, as he paced the deck of his noble vessel, and though she flew with all her speed over the waters, still it seemed to the young captain as if she had never sailed so slowly before. Occa- sionally he would cast his eagle eye across the southern horizon, and, as no sail was visible, and only the clear expanse of water met his vision, he would turn back, with a darker shade upon his brow, and resume his wall. Standing near one of the large guns of the Conqueror, and gazing earnestly at the southern horizon, were the Count de Valence, Franton, and one of the soldiers who had accompanied them in the search for Lady Eustatia. A shade of anxiety rested upon the countenances of all, for the lovely maiden who had been so ruthless. ly torn from her home, had endeared herself to them, by her gentle temper and nobleness of heart, and each felt an anxiety which th qa[le no effort to conceal, respecting the fatof the lovely young belle of London.     Seated upon one of the huge guns, with one' limb gathered into his lap, was an entirely dif- ferent personage from the others, but who was considered of full as much importance, in the enterprise upon which they were now bound, as any other one of the company. As the reader has doubtless already supposed, this personage is Mr. Jerry Jenkins. He, of all the others, was perfectly composed, and looked not at all concerned about the matter, though an acute ob- server would have seen that those quick, restless eyes were fixed upon the southern horizon, and if even the wing of a sea-bird darkened the clear sky, it passed not unseen by him. Not one word was spoken by those watchers, but the anxious glances told what were the thoughts of all. The sun arose over the blue ocean, and nearly reached the meridian, yet no appearance of a sail had lightened the hearts of the devoted band. The shadow upon the brow of Norville deepened into an expression of the keenest anguish, and his dark eyes glittered with an unearthly fire. The suspense could have been calmly endured but little longer, when suddenly the shrill voice of Jerry cried out: "A sailI a sail! there's a sail a comin'-" 4"Sail ho!" called out the man at the mast- head, suddenly interrupting Jerry's shrill voice, with his ringing tones. "Where away!" cried Norville, with in- tense eagerness. "In the southern board!" answered the lookout, in a clear, ringing tone. "Can you make her out?" again cried the excited young commander. "Not yet. But she's coming this way, I believe." Again the hopes of Norville, that had been so suddenly roused, fell back upon his heart. If the vessel was beading towards the north, it could not then be the brigantine. But the hope that the new-comer m;ght give them some intelligence of the buccaneer's ship, was suffi- eieikto excite his mind to the highest degree. 4where is she, Jerry?" said the young captain, approaching the lynx-eyed fellow, who still stood gazing towards the south.   "Why, cap'n, don't you see 'er?" exclaim- ed Jerry, pointing with his long finger ,?& southern direction, "there she is, right there!" "Where?" "There! why, cap'n, have ye lost yer eyes, that you can't see that ere critter a comin'?" "O, yes, I see her faintly now," said Nor. ville, more to himself than to his companion, as he faintly discerned the appearance of a ship, darkly outlined against the clear blue sky. "But it cannot be the brigantine," he mur- mured, "for it is evidently heading towalrs us, and it is- hardly possible that we should over- haul the pirate vessel so soon. Yet this craft may give us some intelligence of her-as she comes from the south, she may have passed the brigantine. We will hail her, at all events- and learn what we can of her." The two vessels now rapidly neared each other. It was soon discovere that the stranger was but a Danish fisherman, and it was quite likely knew nothing of the brigantine. But Norville determined to hailAer-and he did so. The hail was answered from on board the fish- erman, for the vessels were now within speahing distance of each other. "Have you passed any vessel sailing in a southern direction,*since yesterday morning " asked Norville, of the Danish captain. ' We passed one about sundown yesterday," answered the other. "Can you give us any description of her?" eagerly asked the young English captain. "She was a very handsome, dashing-looking brigantine, and as far as I could judge, a very fast sailer. She was armed'like a regular war- vessel, but of what nation she was, I could not tell, as she carried no flag. Her hull was paint ed black, with a red stripe-" "That's her! that's her!" cried Jerry, clapping his long skinny hands with glee. '"D'ye say she was a goin' south'?" The Danish captain eyed the curious looking fellow for a moment without speaking, and then said: "Yes, sir, she was." "Was she larger than this vessel?" eagerly asked Norville,   "She was not so large," promptly replied the Danish captain. "She was rather small for a brigantine, but well-armed, and I think likely very well manned. But, captain, if you are going to try to chase that vessel, I think she'll show you a clean pair of heels." "Why?" asked Norville. "She is a very fast sailer." "Then there is more need of our sailing as fast as possible," answered the excited captain. "You have given  us important information. Take this as a slight repayment;" continued 'Norville, throwing a purse of gold on the deck at the feet of the Danish captain, and ere the astonished man could answer, the Conqueror was bounding away in a southern direction, with the speed of a sea-bird upon the wing. The cloud upon the brow of Norville was by no means lightened, for the information given by the Dauibh fisherman had depressed his spirits, rather than lightened them. He still paced the deck, and the anxiety of his mind had amounted almost to frenzy, when a hand was laid lightly upon his arm, and turning, he saw the sybil standing beside him. "Norville," she said, calmly, "I fear you are giving way to despair. You allow this sub- ject to agitate your mind in such t manner, that it'is driving you almost to madness." "Your words are too true, good sybil," an- swered Norville. "I feel that I cannot endure this suspense much longer. But I am not giv- ing way to despair-I am firn in my determi- nation to rescue Eustatia, or lie in the attempt. This search will end in either victory or death!" "And I pray that it may terminate in vic- tory," said the sybil, fervently, " both for your  sake and hers." "It shall be so, if it is in the power of mor- tal, to do it," answered Norville, firmly. '"Norville," said. the strange sybil, earnestly,  and laying her hand upon the shoulder of the young man, "  you must not allow this deep sor-  row to take such possession of your soul. Eus- tatia loves you with her whole heart-let the- thought that she will be true to you, in life or ] death, be a consolation in this dark hour. If a   she dies, it will be with your name upon her lips-if she lives, it will be to bless you with her love, and to be your happy bride. You knew that her life or death depends much upon you- give not way to such anguish, but look forward, through the dark present, to a brighter future!" "I will obey you, noble woman!" said Nor- ville, while the dark shade upon that noble brow faded beneath the cheering influence of hope. "You are my better angel-you shall be obey- ed!" The sybil smiled, and turning she left him and descended to the cabin. Norville paced the deck with a lighter heart than before, and his dark eyes, though still flashing with spirit and determination, had lost their unearthly fire. "Sail ho " again cried the lookout, his ring- ing voice starting all to their feet. "Where away T" again oried Norville. "Towards the French coast!" answered the lookout; "there are two of them I I guess they are a couple of French vessels going down the channel!" "Then we can gain no information from them," murmured Norville, " for it is scarcely likely they would know anything of the brigan. tine." "They're French, sartinly!" said Jerry, whose eyes were considerably sharper than those of his companions, as the two vessels neared them. "Ah, yes, I see the tri-colored flag floating at their peaks," murmured Norville; I they are a couple of war-ships going down the channel." "Shall you hail those vesselsC aptain Blanch- ford '" said the Count de Valeneo, approach- ing the young commander. "I think I shall," returned the young man. "They may give us some intelligence of the brigantine. I think it will do no harm to hail them, if it does no good."  "But they are the French, our foes, you know, captain," said Franton, approaching. "Have no fears on that account, my good friends," said the Count de Valence. "I aIma Frenchman, and one of considerable infiluiP, and should they appear hostile, I will do nmy     best to calm them. And when they find upon what mission we are bound, I think they will allow us to pass without any demonstrations of hostility." "If they want to fight," said Jerry, doub- ling up his fists and looking ferocious, " we'll show 'em we can fight too!" "That's what we will, Jerry," said Franton, laughing. The two French vessels; sailing as near as possible to each other, now neared the Conqueror But as yet, they showed no demonstrations of being hostile, and Norville felt re-assured. When they came within speaking distance, he bailed them, and a noble-looking young man, who stood upon the deck of the nearest vessel. and appeared to be the captain, answered the hail. "Have you seen, or known of any vessel passing down the channel since yesterday morn- ing?" asked Norville. "Several have passed down, I believe," an- swered the young man, " will you be pleased to describe the particular one you are in search of?" Norville described the brigantine as near as it was in his power, Jerry occasionally improv- ing upon the description by his characteristic remarks. "By my faith, sir," said the young French captain, when Norville had concluded, " that is the very vessel we are after!" "Is it possible 1" exclaimed Norville. "It is perfectly true, sir," answered the young man, " perhaps you are not aware that the brigantine wAoh you have described, is the ship of the Spanish buccaneer, Captain Cres- celle i" "I had suspected it l" said Norville. "But is there any hope of our overhauling her?" Louis de Louvestein, for it was indeed he who was the commander of the French vessel, now related to Norville in a very brief manner some of the facts which De Granoelon had communi- cated to the king of France, ind added that they w* ralready on their way to destroy the haunt ofM   buccaneers and liberate the prisoners that might be found there.   "May justice at last be given them!" ex- claimed Norville, his eyes flashing fire. "It shall be!" returned de Louvestein. "They will soon be in our power-they cannot escape!" "My young friends," said the Count do Valence, who well knew both Captain Blanch- ford and the young marquis, "I we are all bound upon the same errand--the destruction of a lawless band of men, who have long infested our seas with their piracies. Though the kings of our different nations are at feud, and the French are foes to the English, let this enter- prise, at least, be carried on without any such animosity. Each is going to rescue a much loved friend from the power of those heartless villains-one a sister-the other a betrothed bride; and my friends, I ask of you, let each assist the other--let the conflict be one in which our hands are mutually raised to redress the wrongs of those we love. Captain Blanchford, I know you can but grant this. Captain de Louvestein, your eye tells me I have not mis- judged your noble character." '"Captain de Louvestein," said Norville, springing upon the deck of the French vessel, and grasping the proffered hand of the hand- some young man. " let it be as our noble friend bas said-let all national feuds be unthought of for the present--let us now, if not afterwards, be friends." "Captain Blanchbford," said Louis, his fine eyes sparkling with pleasure, " let us be friends nowt, and 1 fear not but we shall be ever friends!" "I am sure it will be so, upon my side," said Norville. his fine countenance lighting up with a smile that at once won the heart of the young marquis. "Here is my hand, Captain Blanchford," said the Duke of Orleans, a noble looking, middle- aged French noble, approaching the two young captains, and extending -bis hand frankly to the pleased and surprised Englishman.  "The ex- pression of your countenance tells me that you are a man to be both loved and trusted, and be you English, French, Spanish, or of any other nation, the Duke of Orleans is your friend." Norville grasped the extended hand of the old noble with the fervor of ah old friend, and his speaking  countenance beamed with undis- guised pleasure. Ere five more minutes had passed away, the three vessels were bounding on their course down the English channel, in chase of the bue- caneer Urigantine.   CHAPTER XVI. THE ESCAPE-CAPTAIN CRESCELLE AND NARITO--; DE GRANCELON---HeE POWERFUL BLOW--THE FEARFUL SENTENCE. "When threatening darkness gathers o'er, And hope's bright visions flee, Like the sullen stroke of the muffled oar, Our hearts beat heavily." VOURS-long, anguish-fraught hours, passed silently away, yetstill Amina de Louvestein Fat upon the cold stone floor of the cell in which she had imprisoned herself, and by degrees, the true hopelessness of her situa- tion came home to her soul. She knew it was madness to attempt to escape by the door of the dungeon, for the buccaneer captain was there imprisoned, and even had he not been, escape would have been impossible, for there was no outlet to the cell save the trap-door, and that could not be opened upon the inside. It was trae, thatfthere was a secret door which led from the cell ia which Amina was a prisoner- but she knew it not, and therefore could not escaipe by it. Yet there was one thing which consoled her--she knew that Crescelle was also a prisoner, anrid that if no other of the band knew of De Grancelon's traitorship, that her lover was, for the present, safe. And she had, by her courage anc self-possession, saved the life of him who was dearer than life itself, and she regretted not the consequences, thought not of herself, in his danger.  Her greatest fear was, that others, beside Creseelle, might have over- heard their conversation, and would attempt her lover's life, before it was possible for the expect- ed French vessels to arrive. And then came another thought-her beloved twin sister, the captive' Eastatia, should the noble De Grancelon lose his life, would be without a friend or pro- tector, and perhaps she would, also, fall a vic- tim to their vengeance. Thesethoughts, which her -vivid imagination painted as almost realized, filled her with the keenest anguish. She paced the narrow bounds of her cell with a quick, nervous step, her mind excited with the most terrible fantasies.  If she were only free-how would she warn her   lover of his imminent danger, and counsel him to flee. Perhaps her own feeble arm might again save him; but, come what might, she would share his joys and sorrows, his trials and dangersI Bat such thoughts were useless-' they could not calm, but only increased her agony. But far different were the thoughts of the imprisoned buccaneer. He, too, paced his nar- row cell, with a haughty, impatient step, his dark eyes flashing with a wild, fearful fire. The dungeon was dark as the infernal regions of Erebus-cold, damp, and with a heavy, choking atmosphere; yet the buccaneer heeded it not, for the only thought that burned within his bosom was revenge I De Grancelon had proved a traitor to the infernal band-he burned to wreak his vengeance upon himul Amina de Louvestein had cunningly led him into a trap from which he had no power to escape-what would he not give to bury his dAgger in her heart I But he knew that she, also, was a prisoner, and a gleam of fiendish triumph shot across his countenance, as he thought thathe was sure of at least one victim I He had heard enough of the conversation be- tween De Grancelon and the sisters -to know that the former had laid all his history and present position before the king of France, and was soon expecting a couple of slips, which, with his own assistance, would entirely break up the whole band of buccaneers. Creseelle knew that if the vessels did arrive while De Grance- Ion was alive and at liberty, there was no hope for the lawless band-for DJ Grancelon knew every secret recess of the vast cave, and every attempt to escape would be foiled. The only hope of the buccaneer captain was, that by some means, he might effect his own escape, and wreak his vengeance upon De Grancelon; thus destroying all fear of being conquered by the expected enemies, as the secret recesses of the cave would afford them a safe and unknown hiding place; for it would be folly to attempt to conquer their enemies by force of arms, as De Grancelon had doubtless taken care to send for a force much larger than the buccaneers would     be able to master. But the pirate captain hnped to foil them, yet! But as the hours passed on, seemingly on leaden wings, this hope grew fainter. The crime-stamped buccaneer began to tremble, and the fear of death intruded upon his thoughts of revenge. His eyes gleamed with a wilder, fierceer glare, and his fiery eye-balls, which flash- ed like those of an angry tiger, in the deep dark- ness, seemed almost starting from his head. His countenance became livid, and large drops of perspiration stood upon his brow.: His teeth were firmly set, and his carved lips of an ashy paleness. This frenzy of mind could not be en- dured, the captain knew, without soon ending in madness. Determining to make one more effort for es- cape, he sprang to the door, and threw his whole weight against it. But the firm bolts resisted the attack, and all his efforts were in vain. Sad- denly a gleamiof light attracted his attention- the trap-door by which he had entered slowly opened, and Crescelle saw one more avenue for escape I The trap-door was one which if opened by a person stepping upon it, would let them down into the cell below, but spring back to its place. aid could not be opened upon the inside. But if opened by touching a concealed spring. it would remain so until closed by another spring It was in this manner that it was unclosed, and as it sprang back, a man, holding in his hand a light, sprang through the opening into -the dungeon. "Thank the stars!" exclaimed the voice of Marito, as his eyes rested upon the buccaneer commander, "I've found you at last!  Why on earth are you here, ca]tain?" "  Let me get out of this infernal den, and I'll tell you," answered Crescelle, springing to- wards the trap-door. Tn a few moments both had left the dungeon, and Marito touching the spring, elosed the trap. "  Why, what in the name of wonder is the matter with you, captain?" exclaimed Marito, is you look as wild as an Africari tiger!" r "Marito," answered Crescelle, " if I had re-   mained in that cell ten minutes longer, I should have been a madman!" "Captain Crescelle!" "It is true, Marito!" "But how in the name of all that's wonder- ful did you come there?" Crescelle then related to Marito the circum- stances of his ascertaining that De Grancelon was a traitor to the band, of Amina's attempt to take his life, and of the chase and final im- prisonment of bboth. Marito's eyes flashed fire as he listened to the recital. 1"De Grancelon a traitor!" he cried, "and this pretty-faced French girl has done it! This comes, Captain Crescelle, of your rescuing the little viper from the burning Orient!" 4"No, no, Marito," answered Creseelle, " this is not the cause of De Grancelon's treachery, though it is true, that he loves Amine de Lou- vestein, and she returns his atffection. M3arito," continued the buccaneer, fixing his eyes up'i the face of his companion, " four years ago, I murdered De Grancelon's only sister. Burn- ing with a determination to avenge tier, he at last sought me out, and by the most perfect cun- ning, induced me to admit him as a member of our band. This was only to learn the secrets of our cave, which he has successfully done. Not a word of this would I have believed, for I placed full confidence in De Grancelon, had I not heard it from his own lips. He has sent a detailed account of all. his adventures to the king of France, and within two days, he expects two French war-ships here, to destroy our band forever!" "Infamous traitor!" cried Marito, with flash- ing eyes. "And do the two maidens know this?" "' They do. But one of them is safe, for she shall never see th3 light again 1" 1"Ah, that she is," returned the villain, with a grim smile. "*She's caught now-I guess she'll be sorry yet that she tried to save her traitor lover!" "But her death shall not save hnim I Before another hour has elapsed, De Grancelon  must be no more! Then with no one to guide them   into the secret recesses of the cave, it will be useless for any of-our foes to attempt to conquer us.)' 'i You are right, captain. But did the girl wound you seriously?" "The ball passed through the fleshy part of the arm, but did not injure me seriously. Af- ter I entered the dungeon, and found myself a prisoner, I ascertained that it was bleeding pro- fusely, and bound it tightly with my handker- chief. But were it ten times as bad, it should not stay my vengeance against the traitor!" "And it will double his agony to know that his beloved Amina dies in attempting to save his life. We will take good care that he shall know all the particulars!" "Yes, that we will," returned Crescelle, with a fiendish smile; " but where is De Grancelon? And what did he tell you of my disappearance *'" "He told us that you had suddenly disap- peared, but where or how, he did not know. He's been searching the cave ever since, and I supposed was lookingfor you, but it seems he'd rather not find you at present, but was looking PEr this spirited little French beauty. I thought he wouldn't have looked quite so wild and anx- ious just about your disappearance, but then I asked no questions, for I never suspected that Lieutenant De Grancelon was otherwise than a true member of the band." "He was looking for the fair French maid- en," said Crescelle, " but poor fellow, he was sadly disappointed! But, Marito, she is a brave one!"             "You do not intend to pardon her, captain?" "By the' Black Eagle, no!" answered the villain. "She will never see the light again! But where is De Grancelon now?" Marito was prevented from answering  by hearing the sound of footsteps approaching; and both himself and the captain immediately sprang behind a curtain, and a moment after, the tall, graceful figure of De Grancelon appeared. There was a shade of deep sorrow upon his broad, intellectual brow, and his cheeks were ashy pale. The villains who watched him, well knew the cause, and a demoniac smile flitted   over the countenances of both, as the young man passed by them. Silently leaving their hiding-place, they followed him. He was too deeply absorbed in his own anguish to notice the light, cat-like footsteps behind him, and the villains followed without interruption. The young man passed through several long passages and richly-furnished rooms, and at last stood before a large massive door, which he slowly opened, and putting aside the rich dra- pery, entered the brilliantly lighted room. Lady Eustatia, who was seated upon a rich velvet cushion, with her face buried in her hands, sprang up as he entered, to read in his counte- nalice the confirmation of her fears, or the real- ization of her hopes. But she saw only des- pairing anguish marked upon those noble fea- tures, and sinking back upon the cushion, she faltered:    -- "You have not seen Amina V" "No, Lakey Eustatia," answered the young man, in tones of anguish ; " my beloved Amina is lost to me, I fear, :frever.  And the severest agony of all, is that it was in saving my life, that the one I loved so dearly has lost her own. [ would rather, have died a thousand deaths, than that she should be harmed I Life is value- less to me now, and I care not how soon death claims me, for I shall meet the one I loved in heaven!" The agonized young man buried his face in his hands, and wept-yes, the man who feared not the storm and smoke of battle, who feared not the foaming ocean in its wildest fury, wept like a child I Such is the power of true love- it bows the strong man, and renders his strength but weakness, when the loved one, so dearly cherished, is torn from hiJ .embrace, never to meet again I "Have you found her body, or any traces of my poor sister?" faltered Eustatia, raising her head, and fixing her eyes, dim with unshed tears, upon the anguish-stricken young man. "No--not any clue to the manner of her death," answered De Grancelon. "And Captain Crescelle?" "Has not been seen since both himself and     Amina so suddenly disappeared. I can find no traces of him, no more than of my beloved." "Have you searched every secret passage of the cave?" "Every recess and room that the cave con- tains has been searched." "Are you sure that you have not omitted any hiding-place where they can possibly be concealed?" "Ah, yes," said the young man, suddenly raising his head, " the secret dungeons of the cave I had not thought of. But it cannot be possible that Amina is there." "She may be--you must search them!" "I will do so immediately, Lady Eustatia. If I meet the villain Crescelle, his life shall be the forfeit of the anguishrhe has cost me!" "Sure of it, my fine fellow, are you " spoke a voice, which caused both De Grancdlon and Eustatia to spring from their seats, and turn pale with surprise and horror. The next in- stant the rich curtain swung aside, and Captain Crescelle, followed by Marito, entered the room.  A fie dish smile'of triumph rested upon the countenanoes of both the heartless villains, as they gazed upon their two young victims, and each felt that they were doomed. But De Grance- lon, with a flashing eye,.and his lips curved with a proudly scornful smile, stood erect and fear- less before the two villains, while Eustatia, with cheeks pale as marble, and despair written upon her brow, sank back, with a cry of anguish, upon her seat. De Grancelon was the first to speak. Captain Crescelle," said the young man, folding his arms and gazing intently upon the buccaneer commander, "  I am in your power. But, before you take my life, tell me if Amina de Louvestein is alive and safe?" "She is both alive, and safe, bold traitor," returned the captain, with a demoniac smile. "Thank God " exclaimed De Granoelon; "take my life now, if you wish it; I can die in peace, if she is safe from your infernal power!" "Not quite so fast, my fine young fellow," said the villain. " Lady Amina de Louvestein  is safely in my power, rather than out of it!"   "Heartless villain!" "O, I don't care anything about your hard ' names," said Crescelle, "I expected it. As you're quite a nice young fellow, I'll take the trouble to inform you that Lady Amina is at present imprisoned in one of the secret dungeons of the cave, whose air, you are perfectly aware, is so poisonous that no mortal can live in them more than twenty-four hours, but, ere that time has passed, the one there imprisoned will expire in the most dreadful tortures. Seven hours al- ready has Amina been imprisoned in that cell. Ere one more has passed, she will fall into a heavy, lethargic slumber, from which she will awake in terrible agony; which will end in death! Are you satisfied now, De Grancelon?" "Infamous villain!" cried the young man, as, with a face livid with agony and desperation, he drew a small Grecian stiletto from his bosom, and sprang towards the captain. In another instant Crescelle would have paid the penalty of his crimes with death, but the faithful Marito, springing forward, with a motion quick as lightning, threw up the arm which held the glittering weapon. The buccaneer, seeing his& moment of advantage, raised his powerful arm, and dealing a terrible blow at the head of De Grancelon, felled him to the floor. Stunned, and almost senseless, the noble young man was without the power even to raise himself from the floor. "He is not dead, Marito, only stunned," said Cresoelle, as he knelt down and placed his hand for a moment upon the heart of the fallen young man. "Go and bring a strong cord to bind his wrists, Marito," continued the captain, "for he may be dangerous when he comes to his senses again. You have saved my life, my faithful Marito, and when this traitorous wretch is disposed of, I'll appoint you my lieutenant, and you shall be my favorite friend and coun- sellor. You shall have all the honors that this doomed traitor enjoyed, before I was aware of his falsity. I hope you will prow more worthy of them than he has done." "  I would sooner die than betray you, noble captain!" answered the villain, s he left the   room to procure a cord to bind the wrists of De ". Grancelon; sincerely glad that the lieutenant  had proved a traitor, that he might fill his place! Ah, false-hearted villain! think not of thy bright prospects for the future: for even now, the dark wing of the avenging angel is shadow- ing thy path, and- will yet crush thee beneath its resistless power! Finding that De Grancelon was too much stunned to rise, the buccaneer captain left him, and approached the trembling Eustatia. "Ah, my lovely beauty!" exclaimed the villain, "you hoped to be soon safe from my, power, did you not?" "Fortune is treacherous," answered the maiden, calmly; " and though you now triumph, the scale may yet turn in our favor. God is just-he will preserve the innocent, but the guilty-his wrath must soon be visited upon them!" "This is all very fine talk, my charming beauty, but it don't do any good at all; only the exquisite grace with which you say it makes you look all the more beautiful!" "My words are true, Captain Crescelle!" said the young girl,'while her eyes flashed, and all the native fire of her spirit was kindling within her bosom. "I do not dispute you, beautiful Lady Eus- tatia," answered Crescelle, in a mocking tone, "but here comes Marito, and I must attend to De Grancelon. One kiss, my lovely lady-I'll take one, at all hazards!" And before Eustatia could spring from him, he had imprinted a kiss upon her broad white brow. The indignant girl drew up her proud form to its utmost height, and gazed scornfully at the captain, with her darkly-flashing eyes, but with a derisive smile, he turned to De Grancelon, without again speaking to Eastatia. The young man had partly recovered from the effects of Crescelle's blow, and could now sit upright. His hands were firmly bound behind him by Crescelle and Marito, and he now offer- ed no resistance, for he knew it would be use- less. Hope could now be cherished no longer-   every avenue for escape' seemed cloped! Mari- to assisted him to arise from the floor, and then stood, firmly clasping the young man's arm, awaiting the further orders of Creseelle. "Are the band still assembled in the banquet hall, Marito?" asked Cresoelle.  "Yes, but, more than half of them are either drunk or asleep," answered the old pirate, with a laugh.  I "Well, no matter-I can rouse them," an- swered the captain; "lead the prisoner to the hall, and on peril of your life, do not let him es- cape. I will follow in a moment." Marito obeyed, and. the captain again turned to Lady Eustatia. "Fair lady," said the villain, smiling bland- ly, "you will oblige me by attending me to the banquet-hall, to witness the punishment of this traitor." "I cannot look upon such a fearful scene as it must be," answered Eastatia, shuddering. "Btt you must, my beauty," returned Cres- elle, "so you will please follow without resis- tance.'    I Eustatia knew it would be useless to attempt to resist; so rising from her seat, with as much calmness as possible, she followed the captain to the hall. A word from their leader roused each one of the pirate band to their feet, 'ad every eye was quickly fixed upon the buccaneer captain. In a clear, ringing voice, Crescelle informed his band that' De Graneelon was a traitor, and related to them the circumstances by which he had ascertained the facts. Each one of the band listened with flashing eyes and close at- tention to the recital. "And now," continued Crescelle, as his eagle eye glanced around upon the excited countenances of his followers, " what shall be his punishment-who has betrayed our band, and, had he not been discovered, would have destroyed us all-what shall be his reward?" As he closed, a 'hundred bright swords glit- tered in the brilliant light, and, like the low, deep muttering of distant thunder, came the fearful answer-"Death 1"     CHAPTER XVIII.

"To' arms-to arms! now charge the foe! Now give them fiery steel! This cay upon the brave man's brow, Shall set the triumph-seal!" OT a muscle ofDe Grancelon's face movD By ed as be heard the fearful sentence-he had expected it, and as he gazed, with a proudly scornful smile, upon the lawless band around him, who were thirsting for his heart's blood he seemed indeed like a martyr hero. His noble heart felt not a thrill of fear--he scorned their power, and his dark, flashing eyes told them that the noble prisoner would not btoop to plead for his lie. But for Amina-we will not attempt to describe his feelings for her, for lan- guage is inadequate to the taslr, A few moments after the terrible sentence had been pronounced, a stillness like death reigned in the vast hall. At length, Crescelle turned to De Grancelon, and, with a fiendish smile upon his countenance he said to the doomed traitor of the lawless band : "Orrland De (rancelon, the sentence of death has been passed upon you, for proving yourself a traitor. No one has said .aught against this snt entce, and it is just. Have you aught to say against it?"  Captaln Crescelle," answered the young  man, in a firm tone, while he fixed his flashing i eyes upon the buccaneer captain,, ' scorn to ak you for my life. But that this sentence is  Just, I deny. You murdered my only sister- - I vowed to avenge her. My whole soul was bent upon this object. iHad I lived three more t days, 1 hould have accomplished it-and-ou , would have lived to have been in my power  Bat fortune has been in your favor, and 1 must receive death at your hand. I would rather t die than ask my hto of you; but there is one,  who is tfar dearer to me than life, who is also in  your power. Captain Crescelle, your career has been one of crime, and the recording angel has e been able to place but few good deeds against t the long arrayt of our fearful crimes. Releaee Amina de Louvestein, place her in the arms of e her friends, and it will be an act, which, at the t judgment day, bhall outweigh many of your evil a d eeds."t A smile of scorn curled the lips of Crescelle, U and pointing to Eustatia, he said;  lid   I' And would you not wish her released also?"  "Yes, yes--she is an innocent, noble captive, and the only sister of my beloved Amrina, there- fore woutd I plead most earnestly for her re- lease. That you will release the two maidens, is my last wihh, then take my life, if you wish, and I will submit without a murmurn." "Shall we grant his request, my faithful band?" asked Crescelle, turning once more to the men who gazed upon the scene. For an instant a deathke silence reigned- then from the whole band came the deep, low- spoken answer, like the distant mutterings of far-off thunder, low, but fearfully distinct, "Grant nothing to the traitor!" "Orland De Graneelon," said the captain, turning to the young man with a smile of demo- niac triumph, " you have heard the answer to your request. Amine will die. And you, what death would you choose for yourself?" "I care not," returned De G(rancelon, in tones of keenest anguish "It would make no difference with us if you did,." said Crescelle, with a sneer. ." But your fate is sealed, for within half an hour you, will he beheaded. Cariton and Lanton, prepare the block and axe for execution, in the very centre of this hall Have all ready very soon. An example, such as shall terrify all, shall be made of this traitor." And then turning again to De Grantelon, he said--"As the Lady Ami- na thinks you are perfectly safe, and therefore will be perfectly contented to die foryou, I have oncluded that she, too. shall be a witness of this scene. It was by her act, that I was so safely immured in a dungeon, and this shall be my revenge-the knowledge of your death will be to hera more dreadful agony than death. And then she shall be again thrown into the cell, there to end her life in torture. Marito. you will now go and bring Lady Amina. The se- cret passage, which you well know, will afford you entrance to the cel. Tell her nothing of this-only inform her that her lover is safe, and you have come to rescue her. Does that please pou. De Grancelon't'" But the young man had turned away in an- guish, and did not see the terrible look of fierce triumuph that rested upon the countenance of the crimestamped villain. 'In a few moments, the executioner's block was ready, and just as Carn- tan informed the captain of the Gct, 55arito again entered, leading Amina de Louvestein by the baud. A bright smile of hope was lighting up her beautiful countenance as she entered, but when she saw the fearful preparations for death,   her lover bound, and the dreaded Creseelle; r with a smile of fiendish triumph, standing beside him, she seemed to comprehend all, and spring- ing forward, she threw her arms around the neck of De Granoelon, and bowing her head upon his bosom burst into a passion of hopeless tears. The doomed lover groaned in anguish, as he gazed upon the heart-stricken girl. "SAmina, dearest Amina!" he cried, "do not give way to such deep anguish, for you will drive me mad 1" "Orland," said the maiden, looking up into his face, "' are you doomed to die?" "Yes, Amina, ere many moments more have passed, the executioner's axe will sever my head from my body.  But let this console rather than sadden you-for we can then meet in heav- en, never to be parted 1" "I will die with you, Orland!" said the noble girl, while her eyes flashed through the tears that had dimmed their brightness; "t1 would not outlive you for even an inbtant! They shall see with what firmness a maiden can die. We have loved in life-we will not'be separated in death i" *' My own dearest Amina!" said the lo)ver, pressing his lips tenderly to her fair forehead, ** 1 long to preas you to my bursting heart, but it is not In my power. But we will meet in heaven-no bonds shall there bind us, no earthly anguish blight our love 1" The iron heart of Crescelle was not even touched by this tender scene between the devo- ted lovers, and, in a tone of triumphant com- muand, he ordered Caritan and Lauron to tear ttihem from each other, and to ky the head of De Grantelon upon the executioner's block. ** F'arewell, Amina!" said the doomed young man; " my time has comlue!" -will ie with you, Orland,"' firmly an- swered the noble maiden; "' we shall soon meet in a better world--but tor tie last time on earth,. adieu!"' Une kiss-a hurried, though tender farewell, and the lovers were torn from each other. De tranacelon looked up at the two men who stood bestiide hlm, aid, with a calm voice, said firmly: ** I am ready." They led him to the fatal block of execution. The glittering axe lay beside it, and near it stood the executiuoner, a grim smile of satisfaction upon hbd fiendish countenance. The young man knelt down before the fatal instrument of death, and closed hia eyes for a moment in silent prayer. Amina stepped salenrly forward, and kneeling by her lover s bide, and clasping her white hands and clobing her eyes, the prayers of the 1   doomed lovers arose together to the throne of a merciful and avenging Father. Even the icy hearts of some of that hardened band were softened by this touching ecene. But they had only to think that De Graneelon 'was a traitor to their band, and that Aniina had' attempted the life of their captain, and again the thought of vengeance alone filled their bosoms. "Lady Amina," said Creerelle, approaching her and grasping her arm, " a different death is reserved for you, and you will therefore leave this block, for only your traitor lover is destin- ed to die in this manner. You were brought from your cell only to witness his death." "But you will surely grant nlme the Consola- tion of dying with him," answered the devoted girl, looking pleadingly into the countenance of her persecutor. "No, Lady Amina," returned the heartless villain, " another death is reserved for you." "Sister," said Eastatia, in a broken voice, as she approached the kneeling girl; " will you not speak once more to me--give me one word 'of farewell, before you leave me forever '" The soft, gentle voice, the broken tones, and the touching words, melted the heart of Amina, and springing from her kneeling position, she threw herself upon the bosom of her biater, and sobbed aloud. '! Now--now is the time," whispered Cres- celle. to the executioner; "' De Orancelon, lay your head upon the block-the moment of death has come!"             De Graneelon obeyed.  The  executioner raised the glittering axe, but Arlina sprang for ward with the quickness of lightning, and threw up the arm that held it, and the axe fell harm- lessly to the floor. She then knelt by the ride of her lover, and bowed her head, by the side of his, upon the fatal block.    d At this instant. quiuk, low Pteps were heard. outside of the room, and Cresecelle, seeming to comrprehend all, gave a hurried order to the ex- ecutioner. ** Behead them both, instantly I Hesitate no longer, as you value your life!" Again the glittering axe was raised. But ere it could descend, the heavy drapery of the room swung abide, and Captain Norville Blanchford, Captain Louis de Louvestein, the Count de Valence, and the Duke of Orleans, followed by a large band of soldiers, clad from head to foot in glittering armor, and with their flashing swords raised far above their beads, entered the room, and confronted the panic stricken band I "Behead the traitor 1" shouted Crefcelle, who saw their position at a glance.     But the panie-strickea executioner dropped the axe in dismay, having entirely lost his pres- ence of mind. But Crescelle caught it up, and in another moment would have severed De Granoelon's head from his body, but the power- ful arm of Louis de Louvestein prevented him, and the keen axe soon lay upon the floor by the side of the fatal block. De Granoelon had sprung to his feet, and Norville had cut the cords that bound his wrists with his sword. Cathhing up the executioner's axe. the rescued man swung it high above his head, and with a shout that awoke each sleeping echo of the cave, he led on the soldiers to the contest. The sisters spranginto each others' arms, and after one long emnbrace, each turned to look for the safety of their lovers. The buccaneers, who knew that upon their victory or defeat de- pended life or death, fought with a desperate energy, and had not the assailants been a brave and determined band, they would surely have been vanquished. Jerry Jenkins and Franton. who formed   no small addition to the bravery of the party, fought with indomitable courage, and both were determined to vanquish the bucca- neers, but jwt as determined not to lose their own lives in the affair. "I've eotched ye, now," cried Jerry, as he plunged his sword into the bosom of Rostone; "you're one of the tarnal critters that carried off Lady 'Statia, an' now you've got to pay for it I Don't ye feel mighty nice about it now?" But there was one of the French soliers, whose almost unequalled bravery seemed likely to carry the paltn'of viotory above all others He was about the medium height and size, but his motions were made with the most incredible quickness, and not a  moment was left by him unimproved.  His face was concealed by a closed visor, and only his eyes, which were dark.  brilliant and flashing, were visible. A white officer's coat was buttoned over his bosom to his I throat, and he could not have been recognized,  even had be been known to the soldiers.  But I he was brave, powerful, and quick as lightning, 1 and that was enough.           " Cresoelle, who, as soon as De Granoelpn was ( free, saw that all was lost if they did not at- I tempt to conquer the assailants by force of arms,  as it would be useless to endeavor to escape by a the seeret passages and trap-doors, was now I cheering on his men, who fought with a  bravery N worthy of a   better cause. Springing to assist one of his men in vanquishing a French soldier, a he encountered Norville, and with eyes flashing a and cheeks flushed with rage and passion, he i sprang towards the young man, determined to E   ! 'take his life. Nolville was prepared. t9 receive him, and for a time he parried his thdsts with perfect ease, waiting but for a favorable moment to inflict a mortal wound. But Crescelle, as well as Norville was an expert swordsman, and the latter soon found that he had no common enemy to deal with. But while Crescelle was quivering with rage and passion, Norville was (alm and collected, and his hand firm and steady. Unheeding the terrific melee around them, both fought with a determination to conquer or die, and each striving to gain the victory. But, at length, by a dexterous movement, Crescelle succeeded in disarming Norville, and it was evident that the buccaneer was to be the con- queror. Again that fiendish smile passed over the countenance of Crescelle, as he raised his sword to strike death to hiss enemy, but it was for the last time-for Eustatia, catching up the weapon of Norville, sprang towards them, and just as Crescelle's sword was descending upon the head of her lover, she buried the weapon in the villain's heart!" By a dexterous movement, Norville avoided the blow aimed at him by Crescelle, and, as the buccaneer fell, fatally wounded, to the floor, the young captain found himself again safe. He took from the heroic girl the blood stained sword, and had only time to utter--"God bless you, Eustatia!" and then turned again to the des- perate encounter. The young girl bent over the fallen captain, and saw at a glance that the wound was mortal. The life-blood was flowing in a crimson stream from his heart, and-though life was not yet gone, it was evident that a fow moments more would end his career of crime. "WB SURRENDER'!" cried the loud, clear voice of Marito, who was now at the head of the buccaneer band. He had seen the captain fall- he knew the soldiers would be victorious, for the buccaneers were entirely disheartened by the loss of their leader, and Marito knew that to surrender was hy far the best course for them to pursue. So forming in a band, each lay their weapons at the feet of Captain de Lnuves- tein, and then stood sullenly awaiting further orders. The remainder of the band, for more than two thirds of them had 'fallen in the melee, were now bound as prisoners, and, as the tu- mult of the fight subsided, a shout arose, so loud and clear that it awoke every echo of the vast cave-the wild shout of VICTORY. Just as the echo of that ringing shout died away, one of the dark velvet curtains swung aside, and a tall form stepped from bphind it into the hall. It was the sybil of the eliff. She approached the fallen buccaneer captain,   and bending over him, said, ia a low, strange voice-- The sybil's prophecy is fafilled!" The voice roused the dying captain, and he once more opened his glassy eyes, and as he saw the strange sybil standing beside him, they seem- ed illuminated with a flash of their wonted fire. His lips moved-the sybil bent over him, and heard the words: "Yes, it is she who has accomplished my ruin-she prophesied my death, and her pro- phecy is fulfilled!" Again the dark eyes became glassy-a groan escaped his lipi, and in a moment more, the crime-stained soul of Alverne d'Crescelle stood before the bar of an avenging God I The sybil gazed for another moment at the body, and then raising her eyes, glanced around upon the different faces that filled the hall. At last her gaze rested upon Amina, who had just been released from the arms of De Grancelon, and in another moment she had sprung to the side of the heroic girl. She gazed one moment at the diamond necklace which was clasped around her throt--then  at the wondering maiden's beautiful features, and then clasping the fair girl to her heart, she murmured--"My long lost daughter!" ** Mother, dear mother!" murmured the lovely maiden, "Heaven be thanked that I have been once more restored to your arms-that I may once more receive a mother's blessing!" "May Heaven blers thee, my noble daugh terW!" said the sybil, laying her hand upon the head of Amina.  The next instant another fair form was kneeling  by her side, and a, scf voice spoke--"And -me also, mother, bless me also!" "' May Heaven bless thee also, my angelic daughter!" said the sybil, laying her hand upon Eastatia's bowed head. They were a strange group-the strange-looking mother, and the two beautiful daughters, kneeling fide by side, amid the dead around themrX "My friends," said the sybil, rising and glancing around upon the wondering witnesses to the scene, " if you will listen, I will give you an explanation of this, and then I will throw aside my long-worn disguise for the last time, for there will be no need of ever again assuming it." Norville and Louis earnestly expressed a wish to hear the narrative, and the sybil, releasing herself from the arms of her daughters, began: "[ I was the daughter of one of the noblest families of France, and, by blood, closely allied to the imperial crown  Wealthy, beautiful, high-born and accomplished, I was, at seven   teen, the admired of all admirers, and the glory and beauty of my father's household. Yet I had not loved-and until a young Englishman, of noble birth, came to my father s court, I had not found my heart the least isterested in any of my admirers. But I felt a strange sensation at my heart the first time' saw the young man, and ere many weeks had passed, I loved-loved with all the ardor and trustfulness of a first affec- tion-loved Walter St. Clair. And no wonder that I loved him-he was young, handsome, talented and high-born, the fire of intellect flash- ed   his dark eyes, and nobleless sat en- t tlpfdupon his broad, faibrorow. I soon dis- cov^tE that my ardent passion was returned. We met often, he confessed his love, and ere he had passed six weeks at my father's court, I was his affianced bride. There was but one barrier to our union, and I shuddered whenever I thought of that. My father's family and that of the Stt. Clairs were sworn eemies, and their hatred dated back for generations, sthd though my father had shown Walter a kind of cold po- liteness, it was evident to me that he did not love him. He had not suspected our love, for he thought his daughter possessed too much family pride to listen to the words of one who should be, in his opinion, an utter stranger to her. But I thought differently-and mummon- ing all my resolution, I told wy father all my love, my hopes and fears, and begged that he would consent to :my union with Walter St. Clair. I never before had seen my father in such a terrible passion. He told me he had rather see me laid ia the grave than that I should wed a St. Cltair-forbade me to think of him more-and informed me that hbe should the next day banish Walter St. Clair from court, and I would never see him again I I knew my father well enough to know that he would be true to his word. !" 4 That night I had a long interview with Walter, and when we parted, the plan for our future course was laid. Before  the rose-hue of morning gleamed in the east, I was a wedded wife, and,-with my devoted husband, bad left my father's palace, as I thought, forever. We fled to Vietta, a beautiful village in the south-. ern part of France ; and safe from pursuit, there hoped to spend our lives in peace and hbppinews. As Walter was very wealthy, our home had all ythe luxnEics of the one-I had left, and though not so much splendor, it had double the charms t for me. My husband was all that I could wish, 1  d, for three years, my life was one of unin- ,irrupted happiness. -Our twin daughters, Ami- and Balstatia, were then but a few maontf \     old, yet in them we found a new source of pleasure. "It was a calm, mild evening in early spring, that Walter left me for a short time to attend to some business in a different part of the village. promising to return soon. For an hour or two the time passed pleasantly, but then the mo- ments began to flit away more slowly, for I won- dered why my husband did not return. Mid- night came-he still was absent! I did not dare to leave my sleeping babes, or I would have gone to seek him. The sun rose, but Walter had not returned. I sent the servants in all directions to seek him, but he coild'f,0t be found.  Days, weeks, months and   rs passed, but, though every effort to discovf his fate was made, I neither heard nor saw more of Walter St. Clair. I knew he had been foully dealt with, for never would my noble husband have deserted his wife and infant daughters wil- lingly. I soon learned that Walter was dead- but how, I never could ascertain, or by what means. I was inconsolable-but I turned to my sweet children for a balm to bind my broken heart, and in them I now centered all my af- fections. "Seven years passed away, as happily as I could have expected. As the widow of Walter St. Clair, my hand was sought for by many, but I firmly refuted them all; for I could nev- er love again. I was blessed with peace, if not happiness, and until the eighth birthday of my  daughters, no sad bereavement had again visit- ed our peaceful mansion. But then, another  deep sorrow drowned my heart in anguish- for Amina, the fairebt of my twin daughters, e strangely and suddenly disappeared. No trac es I could be found of her, and 1, now utterly heart-  broken, resolved to leave the spot that had been i to me the scene of such bitter anguish. Taking i my only remaining child, the gentle Estatia, t 1 left Vietta, and France, determining never to 1 retura. After a short and pleasant passage, we c reacked England, and selecting a wild, romantic c residence, but a short distance from the city of E London, I retired from society, to spend the re- M mainder of my days in seolusion.  "I now devoted my time to the education of t my romainig daughter. I was perfectly skilled b in all the accomplihhments of the highest order, s and I determined that Eastatia should be also. d She even surpassed my expectations, and grew I up a highly actomplisbed, noble-minted, and v strangely beautiful girl, and my heart was in- i. deed proud of my lovely daughter. She had o the dark, brilliant eyes, curved lips, and broad W intellectual brow of her father, as well as hi   f 'proud spirit, noble mind, and sensitive heart; and I could never gaze upon Eustatia, without vividly bringing back the remembrance of my i lost Walter. Eight years passed-Eustatia was sixteen, and I felt, that as she was now thorough- ly educated, it was time for her to appear in so- eiety. She was very beautiful, highly accom- plished, and as noble in mind as in person, and [ knew she could not fail to become a brilliant belle. In London, I met the Count de Valence, whom I had known in former years, and laying all before him, I requested him to take charge of my daughter as his ward, and introduce her among the elegant society of the great metropo- lis. The next day she was placed in his care, and as I chose to keep secret her family name, she was known to the world as Lady Eustatia "Elive, niece of the Count de Valence. "And now a strange thought suggested itself to my mind. I would assume a disguise, and thus watch over. the welfare of my beloved daughter. From an old magician who often visited my father's palace, I had learned some of the arts of magic, and these I determined should subserve my purpose. Assuming this frightful disguise, and aided by mysterious looks and manner, and my general knowledge of human character, I soon gained the appellation of the ' sybil of the clalf,' and was feared and reverenco ed accordingly. Thus I kept a close watch over my daughter's safety, and she secretly visit- ed me at times, for no one; save the Count de Valence knew that the sybil of the cliff and the belle of London were mother and daughter. "Twoyears passed-I had acquired quite an enviable reputation as a sorceress, and had learned nearly all the secret doors of the palace, at which I went in and out as I pleased. By means of these, I chanced to overhear several important conversations between king Henry and the Spanish buccaneer, Crescelle, by which I learned that the latter intended to carry off my daughter, the beautiful Lady Eutatia, and I determined to foil all his plans. He came to me for aid and assistance in his infernal scheme, which I firmly refused, and I prophesied, with all the impressiveness of which I was mistress, that he should die by the hand of Eustatia, if he attempted to make her his captive. I had a strange presentiment that it would be so-the daughter had the brave spirit of her father, and I knew would not tamely submit to injury. I was somewhat surprised to learn the next morn- ing, that he had put his threat of carrying her off into execution, and, with all possible haste, we came to rescue her. The sybils prophecy has ?een fulfilled-and here, in this strange cave,   once more I meet my beautiful twin daughters, and once more they receive a devoted mother's blessing!' The sybil paused for a moment, then passing the rich chain of the miniature that hung from her neck over her head; she threw it over that of Eustatia, saying as she did so-"This is your father's portrait, my daughter, cherish it as you would a priceless treasure." - The two young girls gazed sorrowfully upon that pictured countenance and each dropped a tender tear to the memory of the lost parent Again the'sybil turned to those standing around her, and saying-"Now it is time for me to cast off this diluise;" she threw off the abun- dant mass of false hair, drew out the two long hideous teeth, and removing the dark dye from her features, stood before the astonished corn- pany, a care-worn but still very beautiful wo- man! Time had mingled a few silver threads with the rich curls of her beautiful hair, and laid lines upon the once fair brow, but had not dimmed the lustre of her eye, or diminished the sweetness of her voice and smile. She smiled slightly at their surprise, and then throwing off the dark mantle and long skirt, disclosed the splendid costume, glittering with the richest diamonds, of a French jSptess! "Heavens!' cried one of the old soldiers, springing forward and kneeling at her feet; " it is the Princess Christine!" "Yes," said the strange woman, "I am the Princess Christine, daughter of Charles the Eighth, King of France!" "And closely allied to Francis I, the pres- ent king!" , Even so." "You will be - most welcome at his court, noble princess," said the soldier, respectfully; "' the nation will be overjoyed to welcome back the long lost Princess Christine. Before your father died, noble lady, he forgave your mar- riage with Lord St. Clair, and bade me, if I ever saw you, to tell you of his entire forgive- ness, and bade me give you his blessing." At this moment, while the soldier was kneel- ing at the feet of the princess, the Duke of Or- leans suddenly stepped forward. He gazed for a moment at the face of the princess, then throw- ing back the dark hair from his brow, he ex- claimed, almost wildly: * "Christine I Christine! do you not know me?  My long lost wife, my dearest Christine, I, I am your husband, WALTER ST. CLAIR, now the DUK) OF ORLEANS!" One moment the princess gazed upon the face before her, then with a wild cry of joy she fell   into her h usband's arms, and was again pressed to his manly bosom! "Christine," said Lord St. Clair, "though for years we have been separated from each other, once more we meet again I But a few moments after I left you on that fatal evening, when I so strangely disappeared, I was taken by a band of buccaneers from the mountains, and with them compelled to remain ten years, and when released, 1 could find nothing of those whom 1 best loved on earth. You, my wife, had left for some unknown land, and though I wandered long in search of you, it was in vain. I rose to fame, rank and fortune, but all was nought without thee to share it." "Walter-myn husband!" murmured the princess; " this moment is the happiest of my life-the harbinger of future joys! Through the long years of loneliness I have longed and prayed for this momnnt-at last it has comrn, and its bliss is all the greater for the delay!' The duke pressed his noble wifet to his bosom, thl cup of his joy seemed full They were a happy group-the husband and wife. clasped in each other's arms, while the beautiful daughters knelt side by side, to receive that richest, dear- est gift-a father's blessing! Another form now stepped forward. It was that of the- unknown officer with the closed visor, whose bravery during the fight had won the admiration of all. Slowly he unclosed the visor-then throwing it off with the closely but- toned coat that had concealed his form, he turn- ed to the astonished soldiers. The face thus exposed to view was extremely handsome-the large, sparkling dark eyes were beaming with intelligence, the lips expressive of nobleness and courage, the features perfectly regular, and the curling locks which fell over his shoulders, of a rich glossy brown. Upon the broad and noble brow glittered a kingly diadem-and on the breast flashed the blazoned star of royalt;$- it was Francis I, the king of France I  "The king-the king?" was the murmur that ran around the room, and a moment after every knee was bent in homage to the much loved sovereign. A proud smile passed over, his handsome countenance as he witnessed the  scene, and, in the rich, deep voice sq well be- coming a monarch, he spoke: "Arise, my noble subjects, for I do not de- serve the reverence you so freely give me. This is one of my strange freaks in coming here un- known to you all, but as we have been friends so far in the enterprise, I have but little doubt that we shall continue so. Princess Christine," he continued, turning to Lady St Clair, "in , + f,4L *, t       },     the name of the nation, I welcome you back to Prance. The noble Duke of Orleans, your husband, has been one of our firmest friends. and even had you no other recommendation than that you are his wife, you would bW most wel- come  But as a long lost princess-one who disappeared under such sthangely romantic cir- cumstances, and, moreover, as the daughter of Charles the Eighth, you. will be welcomed back to France with the most enthusiastic joy. I, the king of France, welcome you back to your father's palace, which shall henceforth be your home!" King Francis," said the princess, "I fully appreciate your noble and generous spirit, but, I may not he able to accept your offer, for my husband's home must now be mine. We bye been long separated-and a cottage with him would he far more preferable to a palace with- out him." "Nobly spoken!" said Francis, his fine eyes kindling with pleasure; "you are well worthy of the high position and title which you bear As Lady St. Clair-as Duchess of Orleans-aas the Princess Christine of France, you are in all the noble, self sacrificing wife, and the true- hearted woman." For a fw moments all were silent. The hearts of the duke and duchess were too full to speak, the king seemed absorbed in reflection, and the listoners were too much surprised to utter a word. At length, Louis de Louvestein approached the sisters, who had risen from their knees, and extending his hand to Amina, he said with a smile: "Lady Amina, though you have now found your lawfal parents. I hope to be still allowed the privilege of calling you sister. And," he continued, in a lower tone; ( I will not ask of you a more than sisterly affection, for, since I parted frorm you, I have found one who has dis- pelled the brief dream of happiness with you, which could never be realized. We are still friends, are we not, Amina?" Yes, Louis," returned Amina, with asmile. "Duke De Grancelon," said Francis, turn- ing to the young man, "from what I have seen to-day, I know that you love Amina St. Clair, and that she returns your affection. And you, Captain Blanchford, cherish the same feelings fir uastatia, which are also returned. My lord duke," he continued, turning to Lord St. lair, "tahee young men, whom I well know, are worthy of your beautiful and noble daughters. Are you willing to render all parties happy, by giving their hands where their hearts are already bestowed'" "   "My noble  sovereign," said the duke, "though I know not these young men, your re- commendation is sufficient to remove all doubts or fears respecting their worthiness I give them my daughters' hands-and with them, their father's blessing!" At this moment, a ringing shout afose, that echoed through every portion of the vast cave- "Long live Francis, king of Prance!" One more scene, gentle reader, and we will close. The war between France and England is ended-and the angel of peace once more spreads her white wings over the two countries. Again the French and English are as friends-- and national animosities, for the time, forgotten. The splendid palace of the king of France was most brilliantly illuminated, and within, the royal halls were filled with the noblest guests. But now the two large doors at the other side of the hall swung open. and the murmur of merry voices is instantly hushed First enters Captain, now Lord Norville Blanchford, and upon his arm is leaning, more surpassingly beautiful than ever,the young nud noble Lady Eustatia St. Clair. Immediately after him, enters the handsome Duke Orland De Grance- ion. accompanied by the blushing Amina, while, bringing up the rear, appears the young Mar- quis Louis de Louvestein, leading a lovely girl, scarcely inferior in beauty to her predecessors. All is silent in the splendid hall, pave the deep, solemn voice of the priest, and when the noble lovers rise from their knees, each presses to his heart hisown beautiful bride I Mid mirth and music, the hours passed on, and there was not a heart but felt the unalloyed joy of the united lovers. The Duke of Orleans and the princess retain- ed the friendship and favor of Francis to the last, and the Duke De Grancelon, Norville and Louis rose in power and favor, until they reach- ed some of the highest offices of the nation. Not for a moment did either regret their choice of wives, but the trials through which they had passed but served to cement their hearts to. gether more strongly. The Count de Valence remained in Paris and was always a firm friend of the parties, and a favorite of Francis. The buccaneers were taken Fo France in chains, and hung a short time after their arrival there. The sybil's cottage upon ;he cliff remained there for many years after, md never did the peasants gaze at the deserted [pot, without thinking howstrangely the SxBL'e PROPECY was fulfilled    TEM END D
