AUTHORS have always enjoyed the happy priv- ilege, not shared by the world, of introducing themselves, and I consider a book to be essentially -the author himself, or it is worth nothing. It must contain the love of his heart, as well as the wisdom  of his understanding. And this is es- pecially so in regard to all works which in any way are intended to instruct the people and perform a use. I do not seek to disarm criticism by saying that this volume has imperfections, or by acknowledging that it contains a somewhat unusual combination of literary features. I have experienced enough of the kindness of the public to know that a few faults will be forgiven; and, as I worked with an entire knowledge that I was violating some of the es- tablished rules of book-making, I must even take the responsibilities. My highest aim is to be a teacher, and I believe, in this the boldest effort of my literary life, I shall not lack a sympathizing and an appreciative audience. J., K. H. Madison, Nov. I, I87x.     To His Excellency, )ear Sir: Had H no other reason for dedicating this book to you than the respect which an author ozees to the head of the State, it would be sufficient; but I can offer, at least to myself, another, which has even greater weight: the friendship which has grown under a knowledge of your charac- ter, and deepened by your uniform peresonal kindness to mzyself Above mnost olter pursuits that of lettres needs the fostering care of those who knozw and appreciate the-labor it entails, and the ser- vice performed by its devotees. That I have found such a friend is a gratefuDremembrance, and I subscribe this, my first published book, to you, with my best wishes for yozry wzelfare cnid  happiness.

Thine, when the dark storm howls along, As when the cloudless sunbeams shine, "This heart is thine, my own dear love!" Thine, and thine only, and for ever- Thine, till the springs of life shall fail; Thine, till the chords of life shall sever. -Dr. Doane. Florence Rimmel had became Mrs. Florence May. hew, or Mrs. Thomas Mayhew, if it suits the reader better. And Florence looked, as most brides do, very sweet and pretty, and none the less so that she was attired in a neat traveling-dress, and that the only flowers about her were in her cheeks. A modest, sensible girl was Florence, and a very proud and happy man was Thomas; and everybody said, "What a lucky man?" except those who exclaimed, "What a lucky woman!" It is not often that a lottery contains nothing but prizes; but, if one could believe all the good things that were; said on this happy occasion, there would be no doubt of the fact that in this matrimonial lottery, at least there were no blanks. Even the minister lost his     12     Romance of the Tabe. gravity immediately after the benediction, and his face ran over with smiles and good humor. We dare say ie would like to have kissed the bride, but, instead thereof, he shook hands warmly with her and the groom; and then, stirring round among the people with but little priestly formality, he brought up many a bashful man and maiden to be introduced, and took  particular pains to interest the older members of the  ampany with a full and correct account of the birth and christening of the married pair, with many inci- dents of their early lives; for he had literally known them both from their youth up, and had absolutely predicted the present joyful occasion while Florence AJ  was still in the cradle, and Thomas had just stepped into his first trousers. We all now to what such confidential communi- cations ead: to a general contribution of reminis- cences y everybody old enough to have any. One remembered what a narrow escape Florence had while teething; a second, the general afflictions of Thomas with the whooping-cough and measles; while the chorus of pleasant recollectionS of school and play- days, of buds of promise and flowers of fruition, made the parlors hum with that sort of joyousness which sometimes extends, I verily believe, to the very street. Have we not all had a sensation flit over us that some- thing exceedingly pleasant was transpiring in a cer- tain house we have been passing? I am a decided be- liever in each person being the owner of a sphere-an outward spiritual manifestation of himself; and when these spheres have one genial, happy, animating prin- ciple, they cannot but affect all who come within their influence.   Introduces a Wedding.       13 Thus it was, I am sure, at the marriage of Thomas and Florence. Boys and girls outside the house clung to the door step and railing, and mature passengers hesitated and passed loungingly by. All had that extra touch of sympathy about the mouth and eyes, which proves my theory that happiness is infectious; and, if even the way-farers in the street were impressed, what, think you, was the feeling inside, among those who, united by the ties of kindred or friendship, were strewing flowers in the -thway of those who were setting forth upon a new and untried voyage? And thus they started forth together, these young /-adventurers! There was music and song, and a break- fast of dainties. There were congratulations in a flood, and plenty of joyous tears. There were hand-shakings and kisses innumerable. There were presents from loving friends, in a little room guarded by a rosy- cheeked Cerberus; and when the carriage drove up, and Thomas and Florence stepped into it and drove out into the world alone, I venture to say that few argosies were ever wafted home with more favoring gales than fell to the lot of those who now, hand in hand, embarked on the voyage of life together.                   .r l,+N bP     CHAPTER II. INTRODUCES THOMAS. How bright to him life's opening morn! No cloud to intercept a ray; The rose had then no hidden thorn, The tree of life knew no decay. -Rev. Ralph IIoyt. Thomas Mayhew justified all the praises showered upon him on the day of his marriage. His father was a respectable merchant, who, for the want of sufficient capital, and with an extra careful and honest temper- ament, had never made a fortune exactly; but he had succeeded, nevertheless, in supporting himself and family comfortably, and in saving something against a day of need. Thomas was his eldest son. Born while his father was yet battling with fortu ne, he was early taught not only the ordinary ruled oI morality, but the necessity which falls to the lot the multi- tude to cultivate habits of industry apd economy. As he grew up, he was more in the habit of going, on his off-days from school, with his father to the office than with boys to the play ground; and he thus became familiar with the ordinary commercial routine while yet in the first stages of his education. Thomas never went to college. Mr. Mayhew, Sen., had not been blessed in that way himself; and, while he did not despise a classical course, he certainly did not appreciate it. His motto was, "what is the most useful is the most beautiful," and he could not see the use of Greek and Hebrew, or of other studies which could hardly be used by Thomas in the sphere of life for which he was destined. "The ordinary branches,"   Introduces Thomas.       15 said he, "he must acquire. I have no objection to Latin, for it is a help to an understanding of English. Let him also have an insight into the sciences, and as thorough acquaintance with the modern languages as he can acquire while at school. Further than that," continued he (Mr. Mayhew was discussing the matter with his wife), "let us see what particular study Tfomas developes a strong liking for, and that he shall pursue to any reasonable extent. I would not thwart him, even if it led to his being a painter or a musician." Now, this last remark spoke well for Mr. Mayhew's liberality, for he cared little for the arts himself, and preferred, by all means, that his son should follow in his own footsteps and become a merchant; and, luck- ily for his peace of mind, while Thomas was passion- ately fond of music, and had a taste as well for draw- ing, his chief delight was in mathematics, French and German. He became a good English scholar, and his school productions were the admiration of partial uncles and aunts before he was in his teens. "All right," said the elder Mayhew, and he rubbed his hands together with a chuckle of satisfaction. "All right, my dear; Tom will be a merchant, after all." And so it turned out that, at the age of sixteen, Thomas was duly initiated into the mysteries of errand-running and preliminary book-keeping in the wholesale dry goods house of Speedwell & Turnover. Thomas' mother did not at first fancy the arrange- ment. With a mother's weakness, she disliked to have her darling go among strangers. "Why do you not take him yourself, my dcear?" said she to her husband.     'x6    Romance of the Table. "Because he will do better somewhere else. A bo i the store with his father is apt to be indulged to' much for his own good. Let Thomas learn to depen, upon himself, as, I had to do; it is the only road t + .   safety for any young man who has to depend upo his own exertions for his future prosperity." :1     The head of Mrs. Mayhew was convinced, even i her heart did not beat in sympathy. She knew th strong common-sense of her husband, and deferre entirely to his judgment. She ever after, however, a most mothers will, showed an extra amount of ten derness for her son when he returned from his dail labors, and endeavored to throw such a charm abou his home as to soften any of the asperities of iif which might fall to his lot when away from it. An Thomas loved his home dearly, and, as he carried it influence with him to his work, so that influence drev him back to it when his work was done; and he cam to his mother's side with such a springy step an cheery voice as made the house vocal with gladness I have other purposes in view than to follow th career of my hero step by step; and it will suffice t say that Thomas, at the age of twenty-four, had ful filled the promise of his youth; and, while he had nc attained to the summit of his ambition, and was a yet but the confidential head clerk of the establish ment, his prospects for a junior partnership wer good, and he had, as he supposed, an income larg enough to warrant him in "settling down" with th object of his affections-the Florence Rimmel t whom the reader is already introduced, but who i certainly wony of a chapter by herself. r             t   CHAPTER     III. INTRODUCES FLORENCE. Quiet talk she liketh best, In a bower of gentle looks- Watering flowers or reading books. And her voice-it murmurs lowly, As a silver stream may run, Which yet feels, you feel, the sun. -Mrs. Browning. It is very common with novelists to represent the Virtues as residents of the country, and the Vices as denizens of the city; and it is especially the fashion, when a modest, unassuming, industrious, and at the same time well-educated, young lady is wanted for a heroine, to draw her from a quiet country nook, of which she is the particular pride and ornament. If the city, therefore, produces only reverse pictures; if Fashion and Frivolity are the ruling deities to whom city young ladies pay homage, I can but hope that Florence Rimmel will be the more appreciated by x the strong contrast she will offer to her feminine surroundings. Florence was a woman when she was a girl, and a girl when she was a woman; and I venture to say every student of character will know her at once, with- out further description. Yet there is no harm in grat- ifying the curiosity of those who are not always satis- fied with a photograph. While quite young, Florence was famous for her plain, old-fashioned ways. So 2     IS     Romance of the Table. demure was she, that "Little Quakeress" became a favorite title. Even in her plays she had her steady, old-fashioned ways, which amused the looker-on far more than the wild hilarity of other children. Her dolls were dressed plainly, and she always chose those whose Mary Stuart style of head-dress offered the strongest contrast to the imitations of the absurd fash- ions of modern days. Florence was exemplary in her studies, yet by no means an incipient blue-stocking. She had neither a high forehead pale with thought, a hectic cheek, nor large eyes deep with unutterable meaning. She was simply a plain, straight-forward, thoughtful girl, full of love for her parents and associates, and more anx- ious to do a kindness than to receive one. She was just such a girl as a mother finds comfort in, and a father takes pride in and loves to talk about. I shall not venture to call Florence beautiful, with- out knowing what my reader's standard of beauty is. We all differ. Some like blondes, and some brunettes. Some fancy the tall and majestic genus, and some the short, merry little plagues whose eyes are always snapping and whose hair is always flying. Some fall in raptures with a pretty foot, others with a dainty hand; some with the voice, others with the power to carry the senses captive through the witchery of music. Where every man has his ideal, there is a very great difficulty in uniting upon the ideal of an author. Florence, in my eyes, was neither beautiful nor plain. As she grew, she developed in feminine graces and had that nameless charm which impresses on( without a possibility of defining it. She seemed ti fall intuitively into Earth's pleasant places, and to carr   Introduces Florence.      19 with her, wherever she went, the odor of the flowers with which she came in contact. I saw her as she came down to breakfast, one morning; she was dressed in pure white, evidently without those helps to deform- ity which Eugenie invented and the world adopted, and the graceful lines of her form and dress forcibly reminded me of some of Titian's angels, in which the ideas of lightness and ethereality are so eloquently illustrated. I would seriously advise all my bachelor friends contemplating matrimony to see their Dul- cineas as often as possible at the breakfast table. A young woman who comes down late and yawning; whose hair is in a disorderly state of frizzle, and whose attire is evidently hurried on with no regard to ap- pearances, starts the day with but a poor promise ol ending it properly. A young lady whose sole thought is how she shall shine by reflected light in the evening, is not likely to be much of a luminary in her own home circle through the day. Florence had no sym- pathy with such, for she was natural, and not arti- ficial. At all times and seasons she was the same care- ful little friend, the same pleasant companion. The charm of the breakfast table, she shone with the same mild effulgence at dinner and tea, in the nursery or in the parlor; in the quiet of home as in the gatherings, without which, in a great city, some people would vote existence a bore. The education of Florence was good, without being pedantic. She was versed in most of the "ologies," and was a fair musician both at the instrument and vocally; and she was by no means ashamed to study the routine of the kitchen-those hidden mysteries which, to the majority of city young ladies, are more      20     Romance of the Table. profound than the oracles of Delphus. Florence could make and bake bread, and many a white loaf, and cake of frosted whiteness, betrayed her handi- ;   work. "If she cannot do everything," said her proud mother, "she is, at least, a very good pupil." Such was the bride who stepped from the fireside of home into a new and untried world with Thomas May- hew. The match, it will be seen, was eminently prac- tical-and so will be the boot which follows them through a portion of their future life; yet I trust the reader will see that, with sensible prose in the com- position of both husband and wife, there is enough of the charm of poetry to redeem their fate from that utterly common-place existence into which too many lovers, after marriage, are apt to fall. \  .    CH APTER    IV. A HOUSE FOR COMFORT. Dum licet, in rebus jocundis vive beatus, Vive, memor, quam sis oevi brevis. While you have the power, live contented with happy circum- stances; live mindful how short life is.-Horace. When Thomas Mayhew and his wife returned from their wedding trip, they were, of course, received with much rejoicing by their relativesfand friends. They were, as may be supposed, "eminently popular," and all their young friends were in a state of wholesome ' excitement in regard to how and where the married pair were to live; and, as it was during the Indian Summer season of the year, when the last hazy, golden days of Autumn were about to merge into Winter, they had expectations of some nice little tea-parties and evening gatherings, which they knew would be of that very sensible, cozy character which those can relish who are of a corresponding character them- selves, as the Mayhew friends might fairly be sup- posed to be. And it was a love of a house, as they all said, which they came home to take possession of; small, but pretty, and everything having the charm of newness which is so enticing. There was not a useless piece of furniture, nor a piece lacking which could be of use. The drawing-room was perfection-so every-     22    . Romance of the Table. body said; and there was a neat little library well filled with the collection of years-for Tholmas was a great reader; and, what is better, an easy talker and a !uent writer. Both he and his wife could read Ten- nyson as easily as they could Moore; and it is a very mistaken idea that a business man and a practical woman cannot have a liking for the poets, or a taste for authorship. But to the house again: I have it on the authority of several female friends, who cannot be- deceived in such matters, that there was an abundance of closet room, without which, in the female eye, no house can be perfect; and that the kitchen was as attractive as any other part of the house. There was a two-story range, with so many provisions for broiling, stewing and roasting, that a professional cook would have gone into ecstasies. Then there was no lack of hot and cold water, and everything so handy that it was almost a shame to make a common "Biddy" the supreme mistress of such a fairy realm. But, after all, the most charming place in the house was the dining-room; not that it contained so very much, but for that air of refinement which gave it an independent character. It was not simply an eating room, giving one the impression of a restaurant; but it was a room for both comfort and enjoyment. The table was solid, the chairs cushioned, the carpet very home-like. -There were some water-color drawings on the freshy-tinted walls, and a pleasant-toned clock on the mantel. The fireplace was a large open grate, designed for soft coal, and the sideboard had plenty of drawers for napkins, silver ware, and the many little et ceteras needed for the table service.   A House for Comfort.      23 And very gracefully were the honors of the house performed by Thomas Mayhew and his wife. She seemed to have grown in beauty and grace by her marriage, and he had added to his native manliness a shade of humor and affability which few bachelors can naturally possess. I am strongly tempted to diverge here, and preach a discourse on the relation of the sexes and demonstrate how utterly impossible it is for either sex to be a complete unity without the other; but the subject is trite, if not threadbare, and I spare my readers; only'I ask any one knowing the world to reflect upon the difference between a mar- ried man in a happy home and any unmarried man 'they may know having no home at all-for a bachelor cannot have one in the very nature of the case. Home implies a duo juncta in uno, and cannot exist without it. So were the pair married and settled. But, Tom, my boy," said an old crony, " it strikes me you are starting out on a pretty large scale for a moderate man." "Everything is paid for," said Mayhew, "and I believe that it is cheaper to have what you want, if you can afford it, at the beginning than to do without it. There is a loss bothRof time and money, to say nothing of patience, where an effort is made to get along with- out those things which are essential to comfort and convenience." "You'are right; no doubt," responded his friend; "but your dining-room is good enough for a gentle- man of fortune and leisure."     24     Romance of the Table "You axe right, no doubt," responded his friend; "but your dining-room is good enough for a gentle- man of fortune and leisure." Thomas laughed. "I might have furnished it for a hundred dollars less, but should we eat any less thereby? I have my own opinion about the pleasures of the table. Come round some evening and let us talk it over." "I will," said his friend; " when shall it be?" "Well, say next Wednesday. My wife will be 'at home' on that day, and I can be 'at home' in the evening. Come-and come without ceremony. We will discuss the dining-room while sitting in it."   CHAPTER V. PEOPLE WORTH KNOWING. Friends in my mirth, friends in my misery, too; Friends given by God in mercy and in love; My counselors, my comforters and guides; My joy in grief, my second bliss in joy; Companions of my young desires, in doubt My oracles, my wings in high pursuit. -Robert Poltok. A bride's reception day is the event of the season among her particular friends, and with such a host as Florence numbered, her "Wednesdays" were sure to e especially patronized. But Florence's visitors were quite a 'different set from what we usually find. I do not intend to assert that she was what is termed a "blue," or that she affected literary or artistic society. But I have always noted, as my intelligent reader has also, that we draw around us those who are like us, or who, 'in business, thought or aspirations, assimilate with us. Here comes in that doctrine of spheres again-the drawing of like to like. Some who. are wise above what is written, amuse themselves, and a certain portion of the easily-amused public, with what they either know or don't know about the "affinity" doctrine, and they may choose to hitch the sphere and the affinity disciples together. Still, the doctrine that "Iike seeks like " is true, and I can imagine no perfect Heaven where it is not in full operation. It is the only way to settle the discordancies which would' certainly exist even among the blessed, were not the Heavenly     26     Romance of the Table. host drawn into communities where the harmonies of their natures can best be cultivated. Through all, of course, runs the uniting thread of love for each other and love to the Father; and thus may Heaven be a true unity. So it was tfiat Florence became, with the crown of marriage upon her brow, the center of a circle which acknowledged her right to reign without a murmur. Here were those who loved music and those who loved books; some who were gay enough to dance, and a great many who liked to talk on sensible subjects. Thomas was understood to be a rising man, and his business frequently brought him in contact with men of intelligence, who appreciated his character and gladly dropped in occasionally to see him in his new home. There were young men, too--young merchants and clerks-who found that particular atmbsphere in Mayhew's little drawing-room more agreeable than their own boarding-houses, the club, or the theater. Science was represented in a Professor of Chemistry, a Mr. Tulford, and there was a fair sprinkling of poetry, music and the drama, or, at least, of that re- spectable amateur professorship which pleases without over-awing us by too much talent or dignity. On the Wednesday following the first opening of Mr. and Mrs. Mayhew in their new home there were a large number of callers, and the house was redolent of sweet perfumes and happy with the merry hum of voices. There were enough ladies, too, of a musical turn of mind, to keep the piano open (a wedding gift to Florence), and enough "darlings," "sweets" and "Ioves " applied to that instrument to satiate a Stein- way. /   People Worth Knowing.      27 After tea, in the evening, came others of a more mature and decided character: a few people who loved both to listen and talk; one or two married couples, who had "just run in," but who were in no hurry to run out; Magnum, an old bachelor, who loved to see happy people, but said little himself; Vohlen, who could "spin a yarn" when asked to do so; the pro- fessor of Chemistry; an orthodox clergyman in good standing; an amateur artist or two; and a few of those jolly good fellows who pass for being wild, but who are ever ready to do one a good turn, or to help pass an evening even in a rational way. The evening was chilly, and Tom received his com- pany in the drawing-room; and the first notable feat- ure was the wide and deep fireplace: the grate hung low, the ashes and debris falling by a trap into the cellar beneath, and a bright fire of soft coal throwing a ruddy glare into the room. Upon the table was a basket of rosy apples, another of nuts, a third of plain and wholesome home-made cakes, and a decan- ter of cider-nothing more intoxicating than that, and something less-a pitcher of water. Young married people expect to be complimented on their domestic arrangements, especially if they are particularly nice, as in the present case; and the com- pliments had the unction of sincerity, even when they approximated, somewhat broadly, the region of flat- tery. It was a nice dining-room. It was far more home-like, and calculated to put one at his ease completely, than though it had cost a million. The friends who settled down in the comfortable chairs felt like staying there-and did stay there,too, until the clock struck the admonitory hour of eleven.     28     Romance of the Table. It was a tacit understanding that Wednesday was to be the social-club night, and that this was the inaugu- ration. I have noticed that nuts, apples and cider loosens the tongue; and the tongues were loosened on this occasion.   CHAPTER VI. MAYHEW EXPATIATES ON THE PLEASURES OF THE TABLE. A Grace before Meat. O, Thou who kindly dost provide For every creature's wants, We bless Thee, God of Nature wide, For all thy goodness lent; And, if it please Thee, Heavenly Guide, May never worse be sent; But, whether granted or denied, Lord, bless us with content. Amen. -Burns. As may be supposed, even the few and sedate friends gathered in the dining-room  of Thomas Mayhew and his wife could not-nay, did not even try to-free themselves from the complimentary style of conversation which young married people are supposed to delight in; and there was much to provoke it. There was, first, the delight in newness which so impresses every one. We are all fond of novelties, and every house freshy arranged for a newly-married pair is a novelty. Then, the Mayhew   dining-room was just the cosiest place in the world- so his friends thought. It was just the room to feel perfectly at home in-a room which invited repose of body and mind. "I say, Tom, my boy," remarked our bachelor friend who had previously doubted Tom's ability to sustain suoh extravagance; "I say, Tom, my boy,     30     Romance of thze Table.  whether you can stand it or not, you have a mighty  nice establishment, and there is a sensation of make-  yourself-at-home about it which I fear may make your  friends troublesome." "Heat and motion," said Professor Tulford, who hereafter we shall simply designate as the Professor;  "heat and motion are the essentials of life; in fact, I  may say they are life. You think, very likely, that  you feel pleasant and comfortable here, because there  is an open fire, or that there are comfortable chairs to sit in, and pleasant people to talk to; but all these would be nothing if you did not feel in the humor to  enjoy them. This comes from a spiritual force,  which, acting upon the nervous system-that finely- strung harp upon which angels might play-sets afloat a myriad of mental activities. The motion of these produces spiritual pleasure in the mind, and we notice a corresponding effect upon the body. Did you ever know a happy person who was not bodily warm, or who did not feel a life-giving motion in circulation through his body?" "Very true," said Mrs. Mayhew. "See how quickly children and adults grow warm on the coldest days, when engaged in any occupation which is spiritually exhilarating." "And then," said Tom, "when people lack the heat and motion of the soul, they substitute alcohol to produce that effect upon the body which they cannot or do not draw from a higher source." "Heat is life; cold is death," replied the Professor. "That is true as Gospel-in fact, it is Gospel. When we say a person is cold-hearted, we mean that he is spiritually dead. A body becomes cold when the  .    -Pleaszuces of the Table.    31 breath has left it, and the soul of man may be dead while the body is still alive. How very few people we meet, close, penurious, unsocial and grim, who are bright of eye and quick of movement. There ia no inward heat; there is no outward motion. Give me a sight of a man as he moves about his business or his home, and I will read his character for you at once." "Very good," said the bachelor friend, "very good; and I am to draw the inference, then, that when people are particularly happy at the dinner-table it is because of the activity of their jaws. But Tom promised to give us his idea to-night of the position the table holds in the family. You have got a very nicq one-solid black walnut, I see, and a twelve-feet extension. Please introduce it, and let us be friends at once." "I had rather introduce it with something more on it," said Tom in reply; " but let us have some apples and nuts-cider for those who like it-and then I will oblige you, though in reality I shall give you nothing new." Helping themselves, the friends gazed contempla- tively into the bright fire, which shed a golden,. flickering lustre on the company around the table; and then Tom gave his promised lecture in pretty much the following words: "Say what we will about eating and drinking, they occupy the thoughts almost continually. Let us consider: From the twenty-four hours constituting each day, we take eight for sleep. We are supposed to work ten or more, and the rest is devoted to eating and recreation, or home enjoyments. But, if this is !J     32     Romance of the Table. so, we find that we mix up with our work and erjoyments a great many thoughts respecting what we shall have for dinner and of what the breakfast shall be composed. We devote some time to con- -  sultation, more to marketing, a great deal to ser- vants and the kitchen generally, and many odd moments to reading the receipts we find in the papers, or mysterious researches into the merits of new baking powders, and the reasons why the buckwheat don't satisfactorily rise in the morning. I am only talking about the common lives of common people. When families can afford, and do give grand entertainments, of course the table often becomes an absorbing topic. But with every one there is hunger to appease, and appetites to be gratified. Hundreds of books have been written on the advantages of a plain diet; yet people live pretty much as they please, and the craving for a variety, and for the delicacies as well as the substantials, cannot be overcome. A learned doctor says puddings, pies and cakes are poisonous; yet people will have them in spite of the doctor. "Now, of all people in the world, Americans live most atrociously. The cravings of their honest natures are appeased by most dishonest means. They eat puddings and pies when they should eat roast beef, and they swallow in ten minutes what should occupy half an hour. The result is, we are a nation of dyspeptics; sallow-faced, glassy-eyed, a bilious liver, a dizzy head, with a tendency to headaches. A business man rises in the morning languid, and still sleepy. He hurries his toilet, and washes his face and hands hastily. He' descends to the dining-room,   Plasures of the Table.     33 swallows one or two cups of coffee, fills his stomach with hot rolls and indigestible ham, and then rushes to a business which taxes his mental powers to the utmost; wastes his bone and muscle-for the mind will feed upon the body--until the hour of noon. He then rushes to a restaurant; takes a hasty dinner of badly-prepared food (too often nothing but the trash to be found on lunch counters), and then, falls to his work again, as thougli he had his soul to save and was limited to five hours in which to accomplish it. If he is a moderate drinker-for I do not speak of drunkards; they are outside the pale of esthetic discussion--he has his toddy now and then; for his rebellious nature calls for more sustaining power than he has given it, and, thoughtlessly, he supplies it with that which has a temporary stimulating effect- and so he finishes the day, probably winding up with two or three cups of tea, hot rolls, more sweet cake and cigars, and another toddy for a night-cap. Here is one life in one day. Who can say that the true position of the table is understood with us?" "The picture is by no means over-drawn," said the Professor; "I know it is true to the life, for I have lived exactly in that way myself." "And we women do not live auy more sensibly," remarked Mrs. Mayhew.   "A woman's appetite is as capricious as coquettes are said to be, and they are fed on as unsubstantial viands as can be picked out of a pastry-cook's shop. Do you think it natural, Professor, for women to constantly complain of sick headaches, and a hundred similar maladies?" "  By no means. It is only in civilized countries we find such curiosities as sick-well women-womoen 3     34     Rozmane of the Table. who are always getting better, but who are never well. There is no such thing as a natural disease. Who ever heard of a lion having an intermittent fever, or of a properly cared-for cow having the chills? Our diseases are the results of our dissipa- tions, and I should not wonder if even our domestic animals shared in them sympathetically with us. But go on, Mayhew." "We go to great extremes," resumed Thomas;  "there is with us no juste milieu. So fearful are some good people of being considered gluttons, that they deny themselves even the ordinary comforts of the table; while others, whose appetites are variable, find nothing to suit them and turn from it in disgust. Many more, who are gormands, if not gluttons, make the table a god, and worship no other. The table, it strikes me, should be made a means to an end; not simply for the satisfaction of the appetite, but as a rallying point for the development of the social virtues."           E "Mayhew, you're a brick!" exclaimed the Professor, vivaciously. "Why, the entire tendency-the natural tendency of humanity-is toward social harmony, with the tea-kettle as a basis. Nothing can be done without a feast. The first impulse on meeting a friend is to ask him to dinner; if we have any design on a business customer, we dine him and wine him. The tea-table is the greatest match-making institution in the universe, and a party without a supper-table would be the stupidest of bores." "Yes," said the bachelor friend, "a great deal of the intemperance of the day is owing to the fact that it is almost impossible for some people to meet and   Pleasures of the Tabe.     35 have a friendly chat without putting something between their lips; and, as alcohol in some shape is the most available, they take that. Mere cold, business people never think of it; but the nearer the approach to friendship, the greater the desire to partake of something together." "In England," said the Professor, "many business establishments keep private lunch-rooms. They have a nice loin of beef or a cold ham; port and sherry, or a bottle of ale, and sweet bread and butter: all on a substantial table, with a snowy table-cloth and napkins. The effect is exceedingly good, and the table pays for itself a thousand-fold." "If, then," continued Thomas, "the effect is so good in business, what ought it not to be in the family? Why should a man find profit in eating, drinking and smoking by the hour with his business friends, and hurry his meals at home? The wife, as a rule, in families in moderate circumstances, devotes considerable time to the purchase and preparation of the food. She often makes the biscuit and pastry, and delights in astonishing her husband and friends with some new dish. She glories in her preserves, and finds a positive comfort in a pudding. Of what use is it all; where is her reward, if a meal is merely bolted, not swallowed, and all her care for our comfort is rudely over-looked?" There was a brighter smile about the eyes and mouth of Tom's wife than is generally to be found, even when the wife is young and pretty. It was evidently plain that her table would not be neglected. "It is not the amount that is put upon the table, or its cost," resumed Tom, "which makes it attractive; ).     36     Romance of the Table. it is in the way it is put on, and the way we partake of it. Here you have been sitting and picking nuts; or lazily peeling apples, for an hour. You have not reflected that you are not washing down canvass-back ducks with champagne. A man should have enough to eat on his table; but the point is to make what he does have the medium for feeding the mind as well as the body. That is all I have to say on the subject." "And very well said, too," the Professor remarked. "What do you say to a few of us forming a table-club for the discussion of dietetics, and sympathizing themes generally, this winter?" "Agreed," said Mayhew; and "Agreed," echoed the wife-"if you will only meet here. I can't allow Thomas to spend his evenings abroad-this winter, at least." "Agreed to that, also, and with redoubled pleas. ure," sl:ud the bachelor friend. "Your table and ourselves are so happily introduced, it would be a shame to separate us." So the bargain was sealed in a bottle of Jersey champagne; and it was further agreed that on each evening, for the present, only the subject of breakfast should be considered, and that in turn each member of the club should contribute something as a basis for the evening's conversation. Vohlen was then appointed to open the ball at the next meeting. "After such a dry talk," said Thomas, "he can, if he pleases, mollify us with a story." "Agreed to that, also, if you insist upon it," said Vohlen. AS^-   CHAPTER VII. "OW FLORENCE MANAGED HER HELP. It is disgraceful to' sleep when the sun is on high; to awake at noon; to turn day into night and night into day.-Seneca. Florence Mayhew dropped into her position as the head of the household with ease and grace. She had something to learn-as who has not in this world-but she felt a confidence in her own powers, and but few, if any, misgivings. They had but one servant, and she was led to understand from the very beginning that her mistress was the mistress in reality as well as in name. "While you are with me," said Florence to her maid," I will treat you considerately and justly. When you are dissatisfied, leave without a moment's ceremony. I can always take your place myself, if need be." It was quite enough. Rose soon understood that she had as good a place and as kind employers as she could probably find anywhere, and that it was a great deal better, as well as easier, to consult their wishes and way of doing things than her own. In doing as they wished she was free from responsibility, the most irksome burden a servant can carry. "Once clean, keep clean," said Mrs. Mayhew to her, one day. "It is easier to do a little every day than a great deal once a week. Never put off until to-morrow what you can do to-day; and, as you      38     Romance of the Table. would not put off washing your face until Sunday, remember that the face of a house is always visible as well as your own." It was not at all necessary for Thomas to say the meals should be punctual. Florence understood that quite as well as her husband. She knew at what hour he must be at the store, and at what hour to expect him home. "At what hour do you breakfast, marm?" asked Rose, on making the engagement. "At seven." "Sure, that is very early in the winter!" "Is it any earlier than in the summer?" "No, marm," hesitated Rose; " but it seems earlier." "True; but you can have just as many hours' sleep as in the summer-and better sleep, too, as you can sleep more soundly." "But the master does not have to go so early, does he, marm?" "No; but we prefer not to be hurried with our breakfast. You can have your breakfast at the same hour, and then you will be ready to clear the table after we are through." Rose was rather puzzled at this. She had been accustomed to eating cold meals after the family were through; and now to have the privilege of taking a part of the breakfast, and to have a cup of hot coffee, appeared an innovation, while it was a luxury. "We drink neither tea nor coffee," said Florence, "but we will provide them for you." "Neither tea nor coffee!" exclaimed the girl; " who ever heard the likes o'that! Surely you do not drink water in the winter?"   Florence and her Help.     39 "No," replied Florence. "Sometimes we have chocolate, but generally only warm milk and water. That is our fancy; but you are not obliged to follow it." "Well, you must'please yourself, Mrs. Mayhew. I dare say I shall get used to all your ways; at any rate, I will try. I am sure you will always show me when I am doing wrong?" "I will not only show you," replied Florence, " but I will work with you, occasionally, until you can understand exactly how we wish things done." "Thank you," said Rose;"I dare say we shall get along nicely." So the new life was fairly begun, and rightly begun. There were no anxious consultations at the breakfast- table, and a lodd of worriments for Thomas to cariy to his business ith him; neither was there a rehearsal of the day's grievances when he returned to his dinner at six. Ea h had something pleasant to talk about; and, if there had been any disagreeable experiences, they were buried out of sight. In saying this it must be understood that I am speaking only of those minor troubles of life which fret and worry one, and are of no real importance. When the time came, as it did in later years, when there were events and cares to bring real trouble, the safe rule was to share them from the very beginning. "Don't allow them to take root too deeply," said Thomas. "The trouble is half overcome when it is met bravely." Mayhew and his wife passed their evenings in reading and in conversing, or in music, of which they were both passionately fond. Sometimes they went     40     Romance of the Table. out, for they believed in cultivating society of the right sort; and often they had some of their intimate friends with them. But, when such was the case, the routine was but little changed. Tom was asgreat lover of books, and an excellent reader. "We may as well read sense as to talk nonsense," said he-and when they did talk nonsense, it was the dessert to the feast, and not the feast itself. When the next Wednesday evening came, came also the friends, and the number was increased by Dr. Lorton and his wife. The Doctor was the family pnysician of the Mayhews, and a very learned, as well as careful, practitioner. Tom had always been his particular favorite; and, being a social old fellow, fond of good company and good living-and, some thought, an occasion tal glass of good toddy-it was not , difficult matter to get him to join the club. After the usual social chat around the table, and the demolition Of a few apples, Vohlen was called upon for his contribution to dietetic literature; and so, sol- emnly drawing a manuscript from his pocket, he read the following true history, as he averred it to be:   CHAPTER     VIII. VOHLEN'S STOlY. THE BA GSHA WS OF BA GDAD. Benjamin Bagshaw, Esq., of Bagdad, Egypt, SLate of Illinois, was a noted man in a place more famous for whiskey than morals; and Benjamin Bagshaw, Esq., was as fond of his tipple as any other Egyptian, although I have his own word for it that he never drank to excess. "Never, sir!" he said, with empha- sis; "never, sir! I despise drunkenness, sir, as much as any man, and I believe when a man cannot control his appetite he should join a temperance society at once." As Bagshaw never joined a temperance society, it is, therefore, to be presumed that he kept his appetite under control. Bagshaw, like many Western men in tolerable circumstances, carried on a sort of variety business. He owned a saw-mill, a lumber-yard, a granary, and was a noted dealer in stock. He knew all the points of a good horseaall the defects of a poor one; and could tell the weight of a hog or bullock within ten pounds. He was a politician; of course, and had been postmaster for four years. What more was necessary for any man's earthly happiness in Egypt? Nothing! you will all say in one breath; yet Bagshaw did not think so, for he wanted a wife to share his growing honors.     42     Romance of the Table. Now, wives can be had for the asking in Illinois, as well as elsewhere-after they are won-and Benjamin Bagshaw might have had his pick from among many buxom farmers' daughters; and -even Eugenie, the Squire's daughter (with a French name and a French bonnet), looked smilingly upon him when she came to the post after letters. To use a very bad pun, she went after the mail, and had no objection to the other male-to wit, Bagshaw. But, just at the tiIne when our hero began to feel the buddings of the tender passion for Eugenie, there came upon the scene the sentimental daughter of a neighbor, who, having accumulated a small fortune by shrewdly buying up land at a low price, and selling it to a railway company at a high price, had taken it into his head that his daughter (with an Italian name, Lavaletta) should have the best educa- tion money could procure; and, with this paternal end in view, he sent her to the famous boarding- school of the Misses Foggs, at Chicago. It is entirely unnecessary for me to state what was taught there- any boarding-school circular will give the desired information: all the languages; all the arts; all the sciences; all the extras-and all, somehow, was extra, except English spelling, writing, arithmetic, and geography. The Misses Foggs taught the latter branches, but the extras were all under the direction of" competent professors." Lavaletta came home with her education, a great many superfluous airs, and a tendency-to dyspepsia. She prided herself on the latter quite as much as on the former, for it gave her a delicacy and refinement of appearance; and at a supper or tea, all the healthy,   The Bagshaws of Bagda    "   43 hearty girls nearly died ot envy; Lavaletta showed such a high-born disregard for food, and especially such a contempt for any thing hearty. The wing of a chicken was her highest flight in animal food, and she had a decided leaning to jellies and confectionery. But Lavaletta never objected to strong tea or coffee- her nerves were so weak, she said, and she found tea and coffee so strengthening. Of course, the appearance of Lavaletta in the Bagdad church, on the first Sunday after her return, created a decided sensation; and there was not a young man in the congregation who remembered the text-even if he heard it, which is doubtful; and, when Lavaletta sallied out in all the gorgeous array of Chicago fashions, she carried with her more hearts than ever followed the Duchess de Pompadour at any one time. But it is not to be supposed that the ordinary farmers' sons had the temerity to approach within speaking distance of the new star; and even the clerk, who acted as cashier and first and second tellers in the Bagdad Bank, and who had always prided himself upon his accomplishments, was as shy of approaching the haughty beauty as a cat is of approaching the water; and so long'was the inter- regnum before Lavaletta had any callers, that she began to fear her reign would never begin, for the want of subjects. Lavaletta knew her powers, and was as determined on -conquest at Alexander the Great. She could sing in Italian, and play all the grand marches. She had at least forty French phrases at her tongue's end; and so she passed for a linguist. She had read every new norel published in five years,     "     Romance of the 2 able. and so had a reputation as a literary "blue." She had learned by heart a great many Chicago puns, and so passed for a wit. But the greatest charm of Lavaletta was in her ability to do nothing with the most charming grace imaginable. Half-reclining upon a lounge, with one satin slipper peeping from its hiding  place, and her chignon curls gracefully falling upn \ her white shoulders, Lavaletta was the perfect embodi- merit of lady-like ease and refinement. But all these charms and attractions were likely to be wasted unless they could be put to use; and so, as the ice had to be broken in some way, it was determined in family council that the most expeditious way was to give a party, which would bring all the men to the feet of Lavaletta-and it would not be her fault if all the women died of envy. So the party was given. It was very much like all parties. There was a great crush, and everybody was uncomfortable, but said they were perfectly happy. They had plenty to eat, plenty to drink, plenty of music, and plenty of dancing. Lavaletta sang her songs and played her grand marches. She shone brilliantly on the men-and every single man was in love with her from that time forth. IThere is no doubt that Lavaletta was inclined to be a coquette, and preferred flirting to matrimony; but she was also imbued with the prevalent idea that it was disgraceful to be an old maid, and that when she made a good catch it was better to land him. Her father and mother were prudent people, and were not so rich but that a settlement for their daughter was thought to be very desirable; so, after the party, the effect of Lavaletta's attractions was fully discussed,   The Bagshaws of Bagdad.      45 and the merits of the different young men canvassed. It is not astonishing that only one eligible man was found, lwhen we consider that in most Western towns the young men are all seeking their fortunes, and very few have found them. The happy man was Benjamin 3agshaw. Bagshaw was yet young-only thirty-and he was passably good-looking; a little brusque in his manner, and apt to "look down on cdmmon folks;" but that was no drawhack in Lavaletta's eyes, who carried out the same rule to perfection. How could we expect a man doing such a business-and a post- master, to boot-to have no soul above buttons? Bagshaw had a liking for company; but he also liked to clap big men, like the Squire, on the back, and to drink and smoke with what the French call the haute noblesse. And Bagshaw was smitten with the beauty of Lavaletta, and made her the reigning toast of the season. And the way Bagshaw did spruce up! He wore his "store clothes" every day in the week. His business increased so amazingly that he had to drive his best horses past Lavaletta's door ten times a day; and it is asserted by his confidential friend that the poem in The Bagdad Chronicle ("Lines to L--") was written by no less a person than B. 13. There is a beginning, a middle, and an end to all things; and I can only say that the end in this case was what we may all expect in this troublesome world. Benjamin and Lavaletta were married; and, were the inhabitants of that celebrated town to live to the age of old Parr, they would never forget tho splendors of the Bagshaw wedding. The account in The Bagdad Chronicle exhausted the types to such an )I     "    Romance of the Table. extent that the editor could not even chronicle a barn- raising; and so much liquor was drunk that the tavern had no customers for a week. Everything went off charmingly for a month or two. The Bagshaws went on a wedding tour, and came home as happy as doves in spring. The Bagshaw mansion was newly furnished, and Lavaletta was duly installed as its mistress. Here, were I a novelist, I should drop the curtain. The aim and end of life, according to the writers of fiction, is to marry; and, being married, they are laid on the dusty shelves of forgetfulness like old books- good to fill shelves with, but never to'be read. I am not a novelist, however, and have only arrived at the beginning of my story. The only part which will fairly come within the novel-category is Lavaletta's ideas of married life, which were wholly and solely taken from novels. She had not the slightest idea that marriage would bring any duties; and she supposed that Bagshaw would make a very obedient slave, and that she-could go on striking attitudes to her heart's content. wut, if there was anything that Benjamin liked in the wocd, next to himself, it was his breakfast. He liked a social glass, but he liked it more because of the company he drank with than for itself. But he did like his breakfast. While he was a bachelor his mother pre- sided at his board; and not only that, but she despised servants, and did her own cooking. She was devoted to her s6n; knew all his tastes, and how to gratify them. Never a woman in Bagdad could compete with the Widow Bagshaw in corn-bread, muffins, an omelette, or in broiling bacon. As to her coffee-well, anybody e   The Bagshaws of Bagdad.     47 who sold her split peas would have to wake up earlier in the morning than she did; an impossible feat. She bought it green, inspected every grain, washed it and ground it herself, and it was made with an egg, and poured out hot. The aroma from that coffee-s permeated the house from cellar to garret. But, with the incoming of a daughter, out went a mother-in-law. She had a wholesome dread of boarding-school misses, and, never having been to school but one quarter, she looked upon the "ologies." and their possessors, with fear and dislike. She went from the Bagshaw House toi a married daughter's, for she had no antipathy to sons-in-law-as what mother-in-law ever had? Of course, the Widow Bagshaw was replaced with a "help;" and any one who knows what help is out West need not be told that the Bagshaw help was anything but what the name implies. The Bagshaw breakfasts were very different affairs, now. The coffee was black, odorless and cold; the eggs were either as hard as bricks, or raw; the bacon was burnt and sooty; and the corn-bread, in which Bagshaw particularly delighted, was a flabby mixture of meal, water and bi-carbonate of soda, sometimes called saleratus. "Lavaletta, my love," Benjamin would exclaim, "what does make the bread so bitter?"-and he picked from his teeth a bit of the material which he found so repilsive. "How can I tell?" retorted Lavaletta, pettishy. "You know I never -eat breakfast, and I certainly know nothing about cooking. I think you had better change the help."     48     Romance of the Table. And they did change the help-not once, but fifty times. Sometimes it happened they did have tolerable luck, and things went on smoothly for a while. But it invariably happens at the West that, if the help is good for anything, somebody else wants her, and will have her. Generally she finds a husband, and takes up her line of march for Kansas or Oregon. During all these changes, too, the gloss was wearing off the honeymoon. Lavaletta exhibited a striking fondness for dress and display, and Bagshaw's house was given up to morning calls and evening receptions, to late suppers, and cards, dances, and other corol- laries to fashionable life. Lavaletta "dawdled" all day; was frequently not down until dinner time: continued to have the dyspepsia, and turned up her pretty nose at corn muffins and broiled bacon. Bag- shaw found himself first meditating, the9 sulking, and often at the tavern. "I can't help it," said Beniamin; " a fellow must have some society." One morning, when Lavaletta came down yawning to the breakfast table, with her hair in papers, and with a generally done-up look, the bread was yellow and bitter to an insufferable extent, and the coffee, arid "fixin's " generally, were of a very composite character. Benjamin was decidedly cross. "Lavaletta!" ex- claimed he, "this is really too bad. I do wish you would see a little to thfe kitchen; it seems to me that my comfort in the morning is quite as important as your friends' comfort in the evening." Lavaletta had her own temper, and fired up at this. "Pray, did you marry me for a cook?" cried the offended beauty.   The Bagshaws of Bagdad.      49 "Not exactly; but I think even a man's wife has something to do in looking after her own household." "Well, I can't do kitchen work-that's certain. I was not brought up to it, and know nothing about it." "But you might learn, at least, ho -to make corn bread, and instruct the help. Just taste abjit of this!" Lavaletta put a morsel of the offending substance in ler mouth, and spat it out again in a hurry. "Faugh! it is horrid. What makes it so bitter?" "I suppose it is the saleratus." "What is it put in for?" "To make it light, I presume." "Tell her, then, not to put in so much." So the help was called, and, being informed of the difficulty, she bridled up, as cooks always have done under srnilar circumstances, and politely informed her mistress that, if they did not like her cooking, she could leave, she supposed-and leave she did, that very day. Benjamin swallowed his coffee so hot that it scalded his mouth; and then, after the manner of irate husbands, he strode down the street to his office, with his hands deep in his pockets and his hat on the back of his head, very much to the delight of the small boys, and the disgust of sundry young ladies who had set their caps for Benjamin in his bachelor days. Benjamin did not go home to dinner that day, for he said to himself: "There is no dinner to be had, if I go;" and, as Lavaletta argued in the same way, she went to her father's, and dined there-afterward pouring the story of her wrongs into her mother's ear. I am sorry to say, also, that things went from bad to worse in the Bagshaw mansion, after that. If Lavaletta roused herself from her lethargy, and heroically went 4     50     Romance of the Table. intc the kitchen, she was met by so many difficulties that she sallied forth hot, discouraged, and ill-tem- pered. She tried to make corn muffins herself, one morning, and put in so much saleratus-knowing nothing of the sour milk, or cream of tartar, which sets in motion the carbonic acid gas-that the corn-bread was as yellow as gold and as bitter as saffron. Then she tried again, with very little-and the effect was that Bagshaw went down the street with his hat on the back of his head again, and Lavaletta went home to her mother's, and stayed there a week. I will not narrate all that followed during the remainder of the first year of marriage. It is only essential to my story to say that divorces are as easy as weddings, in Illinois, and that Lavaletta got one on the score of ill-treatment and neglect.

"You are a pretty fellow!" cried Mayhew, " to treat us, while yet in the first phase of the honey-muon, to such a budget of connubial infelicities." "It is perfectly shameful!" said Mis. Mayhew and chorus; but, while they thus united, there was a little burst of laughter from one, and a broad grin on the face of another, until the infectious mirth broke out in. a general cachination.  s ,              i "A saleratus divorce! Ha! ha! ha!" "It is not a lit more ridiculous," said the Doctqr, "than some of the cases which are set forth by, uneasy partners. It is said that a hungry man is a bear; and certainly a year of starvation, and a stomach eaten up with bi-carbonate of soda, might be fairly considelrd in mitigation of punishment, even by a jury of irate wives." "The story, at least," said the Professor, "furnishes us with a text for a good many discourses; and there is nothing in the bundle of small items which go to make up a man's every-day life of greater importance than the method of preparing his food."     52     \ Romance of the Table. "That is so," followed the Doctor; "and most of the ills which flesh is heir to originate in the digestive organs, and in badly-prepared food, or. in the quality and quantity of the viands we eat. Everything relat- ing thereto must be of importance. It is wonderful, indeed, that we have so little science in our daily lives. We trust the latter in the hands of an Irish cook who knows positively nothing, beyond a distant imita- tion of what she has seen done by others. The art of making bread is one of great interest; for, while we can make a meal of sweet bread and butter, both being bad even the best breakfast is spoiled. I remember, some few years ago, being at the West and South, I found it almost impossible to get a bit of decent bread, or a biscuit. It was horrid! Corn-bread and biscuits, yellow and gritty with poor and imperfectly-dissolved saleratus, and bread, heavy, sticky, and often sour, destroyed the appetite, even while famishing. Some get used to it-I never could; and those whose tastes and habits are gross enough to swallow such stuff will finally reach a day of wrath and retribution. No man's stomach is made of cast-iron." "My biscuit is always light, and as white as snow itself; but I never thought to ask how it came so," said Thomas, glancing at his wife. Florence looked a little rosy, and laughingly said: "You must not be too inquisitive about the kitchen, but take the goods the gods provide, and be thankful." "You have, at least, awakened my curiosity," Thomas said, "and I should like to hear something about bi-carbonates, if the Professor will oblige us." The wish being echoed by the rest, with a "Do,   Mysteries of Bread-raising.    53 Professor! please do!" that learned individual cleared his throat, and spoke as follows: -"Books have been written about bread-making, and every cook-book is filled with new recipes and patented preparations; yet there is no more mystery in it than there is' in any of Nature's operations. Science gives us many -interesting experiments and results, with a great deal of learning which house- wives never appreciate. The analysis of grain and its various constituent elements are all very interesting to the chemist; but a woman has a barrel of nice white flour in the pantry, and what she wants to know, is how to turn that flour into forms which shall please the eye and delight the palate." "That is it, exactly," said Florence. "Well, there, is the flour. Take a portion and put it in a pan; pour water on it, stir it up lively, so as to incorporate the two, and we have paste-if it is thin; if thick, dough. Mould it thoroughly-and nothing has been found to take the place of the human hand- stirring in flour untirthe dough will not stick to the hand, and the work is done. The mass is apparently all right for the oven; but, if we have omitted one little thing, we will find our bread tough and indigestible, and fit only for the chickens and pigs. That little thing is something to make the bread rise. "Now wash away the starch from the dough-and it, can be easily done, although it forms a large proportion of it, say from forty to seventy per cent-and the resid- uum may be called gluten: a thick, tough body, about as much like softened but undissolved glue as anything I can compare it to. It is this gluten which it is necessary to transform, if we would have our bread z     54     Romance of the Table. eatable; and the very toughness, yet elasticity, of the gluten is what makes it possible to act upon it with agents. These agents must in some way evolve a gas, and this gas must so permeate every particle of the gluten as to break it up into cells. It is very plain that, if this gas could escape easily, the bread would not be raised; and there are two other bits of self- evident truth: first, if the cells are too few, the bread will still be heavy; if too many, or the gas is so powerful as to form very large cells, then the bread is chaffy. This we find to be the case often with bakers' bread-they puffing up their loaves to deceive the customer, who looks at the size, not the weight. The just medium we often find in the country, especially where a housewife takes, a just pride in the produc- tions of her skill-the large, white loaves having a certain amount of solidity, with all the sweetness of the grain. Festina lente (make haste slowly) is a good maxim in bread-making; and any process which makes brea d rise slowly, but surely, is preferable to that violent chemical action which outrages natural laws, yet, producing a quick result, pleases the operator and satisfies a demand. We look more to. immediate results than strict sanitary rules. "Carelessness in bread-making never yields a good result, and it should be remembered that bread can hardly be too much kneaded. The thorough work- ing of the dough assists in distributing the materials from which the gas is to be eliminated, and in pro- ducing the small cells I have referred to. Wherever we find a loaf of really excellent family bread (and it is rarely found at the baker's), we shall be sure to find that the preliminary kneading, and the moulding s. -    Mysteries of Bread-raising.   55 preparatory to the oven, have been thoroughly at- tended to. "The gluten, then, blown up into myriads of little cells, is in a condition to undergo the ordeal of fire, and you will see that each cell becomes a tiny oven. The heat can pass quickly through the loaf, and in its passage enough is retained, and long enough, to change the dough into bread. The water, which was essential to get the flour into a condition to be acted upon by the gas, passes partly off in baking. There ,should be enough left to have the bread moist and palatable, otherwise as 'dry as a chip' becomes a con- demnatory phrase. Bread-making is more of a scien- tific business than most people imagine, and I believe even more than that, that only a woman can make a perfect quality." "I acknowledge the compliment with thanks," said Florence, " but just now I am very curious about the unleaven bread of the Jews. What is leaven? I con- fess my ignorance, although from what I have heard unleaven bread must be worse than sea-biscuit." "Leaven," said the Professor, "is soured and fer- mented dough. Gas is evolved by the decomposition of vegetable substances, and fermenting dough can be kept fermenting by adding as much fresh dough to it as will enable the bread-maker always to have some left. But bread thus made will rarely be sweet, and the process is not to be recommended." "But is not the use of yeast a fermenting process?" Yeast acts upon the sugar in the flour, producing alcohol and carbonic acid. It is one way of attaining an end which science enables us to attain quicker and easier, although, as I have said, it may be at the     56     Romance of the Table. expense, somewhat, of quality.. Yeast is a queer substance, produced largely by the brewers, as the result of the fermentation of grain; and it can be produced, also, without the brewer. It can be made from wheat flour, from potatoes, and other materials. All we have to do is to get up a fermenting process, in which vegetables decay, and yeast is the result. It is pretty well decided now that yeast is a plant itself, of the fungus variety. It is an instructive study, as illustrative of the fact that Nature is constantly trying to start something, and that from the decay of one substance another living form springs up. But as to the cause of action of yeast we know but little. The most we know is that yeast combines with the sugar, to destroy it, and from its destruction comes a minute portion of alcohol, and a large portion, of gas. But let us drop the subject for to-night, and have a little fermentation of the piano." "And a little carbonic acid music," said the Doctor. "And a saleratus song," yawned the bachelor, who was dozing in an arm-chair. "I am not a loaf of bread, nor a corn-muffin," said Florence, laughing. But Florence went to the piano, nevertheless; and sang the following little song, which I shrewdly suspect she wrote and set to music herself:   lysteries of Bread-raisiz;g.        57 Tell-tale Eyes.

Some come sleepy, and yawning; the majority slouchingly dressed, with paint rubbed off and hair in papers.

The charm of the stage is in its semblance of reality-in its appearing to be, at least, what it represents; but on the stage of life there is no escape. I have idealized and poetized human nature all day, merely to have my castles toppled over at night. I have dreamed of angels, at night, and have been 9   Please Come to Breakfast.     59 horrified to see them come to breakfast in the morning with nothing of the angelic, and very little of the hu- man-cross, complaining, irritable, out at the elbows, flown at the heel, dilapidated and miserable. Coffee cold, fish cold, rolls cold, everything cold, and dismal. It is not much better with the men-worse, even, where dissipation, brandy, and cigars last until the morning, and red eyes and frowsy hair tell of forgetfulness of brush and comb, and carelessness of the proprieties of life. Now, the breakfast-hour should be the sweetest of the twenty-four. It should be fragrant with roses, and filled with the matin songs which welcome the sun. The dew which sparkles upon the flowers is sweet; the child which opens its eyes at early morn is fresh with innocence and filled with laughing life-there is the difference between nature and art; between morning sober and morning drunk. There are a few who live wisely-who retire early enough to obtain the sleep Nature requires within the hours she has provided. There are some who rise refreshed, and gird themselves, as strong men to run a race. They are the ones who come with a cheery voice and a smile of welcome; who sit down with an appetite, a good digestion and a clear conscience; who illuminate the surrounding desert places, and make even the dullest and most faded to realize that there is such a thing as a morning of the mind. And of such were Mayhew and his wife. They had made up their minds, from the beginning, to cultivate their good habits and lay aside their bad ones-if they had any. One of the former was early rising. 1 do not mean to say that they rose with the lark, or that     6o     Romance of the Table. they turned out into the gray, cold, cheerless air before either the light or the SIun had proclaimed it day; but they rose when it was time to rise-ere yet the golden fringe of the horizon had become merged in the full blaze of the sun's effulgence; and they rose early enough to dress themselves before breakfast, and come to the table with the intention to enjoy it. And their breakfast-table was .enjoyable. They were not rich enough for splendor, yet quite rich enough for elegance-for I maintain there is nothing more elegant than simplicity. A snowy-white table- cloth is elegant, especially if with napkins to match. Plain white china is elegant, when nicely arranged, and the, plainest of fare is elegant, when a proper person has superintended its preparation. Above all elegancies are the cheerful mind and the thankful heart, which come to the table as though Love and Contentment were in bodily presence at the repast. He would have been a worse than cynic, who could have complained of a Lenten breakfast with such a fair and cheerful divinity at the table as Florence; and even had the meal been composed of nothing but hominy, Mayhew's favorite dish, I verily believe the shadow of discontent would never have crossed his mind. It is not so much what we have to eat, as the spirit with which we eat; and it was wonderful to see how both Mayhew and his wife sometimes lingered at the table, when there was really so little of a feast upon it. There were so many little things to talk about then; so many little plans for the day and so many hopes to share. Tom carried with him to the office enough of the aroma of happiness to sweeten toil the whole day hrough, and he left enough behind him to make   Please Come to Breakfast.    61 Florence as happy a woman as the sun ever shone upon. She had not thought, then, of that doctrine or theory which makes both man and woman imperfect atoms of humanity, until joined together inxa true congenial union; she had not mastered the philosophy which makes woman the heart and man the head of the one flesh of the marriage ceremony; and, of course, she was still further away from the knowledge of the fact that woman is a slave to man, and man a tyrant over woman.  She did not feel like going either to Congress or the lecture-room to assert her rights, and was not in the least aware that she was oppressed. So far, her sphere was home-and she was happy in it, that was enough. There are a great many whose homes are not happy; let them fight even for a chimera: it is better thus than to wear out in rusty silence. And when breakfast was over, and Thomas was ready to go, she put on her bonnet and went a little way with him; and then she ran briskly back, her cheeks in a glow, and her eyes brighter than they; and the long, trailing lines of sunlight that came over the house-tops found a spiritual counterpart in the sunshine of the soul which trotted along after Tom, chasing away the shadows as it followed, and going with him to the office where he worked; playing merry gambols upon his desk, and flashing from the very nib of the pen with which he wrote.

[To taste of many dishes is a sign of a delicate stomach.] It had been agreed at the last meeting that stories or essays should be read only at alternate meetings, and that on other occasioc- there should be only general conversations. "Your story, Vohlen," said the Doctor, after they had got through with the usual small talk of the evening, "is suggestive of the wonderful variety in the appetites, tastes and repugnances of the human race. Bagshaw had a love for corn-dodgers, and, no doubt, for ham, potatoes and coffee. With these of proper quality his breakfast suited him, and with them his married life might, at least, have pa sed with tolerable happiness. How many are the   however, who would be as easily satisfied?" More than some would think," replied the Pro- fessor. "The world can be divided up into classes. In these classes there may be individual differences, it is true, for, as th, melody goes-- "' Jack Sprat could eat no fat, His wife could eat no lean; An I so it was, between the twt rhey licked the platter clean m But taste is governed more by climate and race than   Englzish and French Breakfasts.   63 by individual peculiarities. Coffee, here, for instance, is the universal breakfast beverage; but who ever heard of a Frenchman sitting down to his matutinal meal without his bottle of claret? At the West, again, where pork is one of the main products. of industry and commerce, and Indian corn the basis of agricul- ture, people eat what they raise; and gradually they form as much of a habit for this food as they do for tobacco." "In cities," said Mayhew, "people have such a prodigal market to go to that their taste is confirmed for nothing except for variety. The question daily is, 'What shall we have for breakfast?' and then, what shall we have for dinner?' There is a constant change, not always for the better, and a constant wearing out of both appetite and patience. Would it not be better, Professor, if we limited ourselves to fewer dishes than we do?" "Decidedly," replied the Professor, "provided the dishes were well chosen. We eat more than we should, and especially of rich food. When we are attacked with dyspepsia, and other disorders, we pur- sue the suicidal course of eating less in quantity, but more concentrated in quality." "What, then, should be done?" "I will not answer now, for it would be too long a topic of discussion; but I wish to introduce you, at some future time, to one of the most singular men you have ever met. He passes for an eccentric, and you will think him one yourself; but his ideas about eating are so novel, and he is, withal, so good an illustration of his own theory, that it is worth while to listen to him."     "     Romance of the Table. "I should like to see him," said Mrs. Mayhew. "And so should I," said all the rest. So it was agreed that the Professor should introduce his friend, Dr. Sollinger, as soon as he could. "And I tell you what," resumed the Professor, "I will tell him to bring with him a lecture he once delivered, all about the potato." "An odd subject," said Vohlen, "and yet a good one, if he knows how to handle the potato as a Frenchman knows how to handle an egg, and to cook it in as many different ways." "On the contrary," replied the Professor, "he will tell you only one way to cook' it; as he sturdily maintains that there is but one genuine way, and that he only is the master of the art." "Modest, at least," said Mrs. Mayhew, laughingly. "What do you say, Thomas; don't I know how to cook a potato?" "I have always thought so," answered her husband; "but you know we may be only in a state of blissful ignorance; although, if so, I do not agree with the poet who says it is folly to be wise. But let us hear, Professor, a little more about the way people differ in regard to their diet." "We are pretty well acquainted with our own coatry's habits," said the Professor, "and bad enough many of them are. It is very plain that we are made up in a cosmopolitan way, for we have no fixed customs which some do not break through. People breakfast and dine at all hours-as best suits their activity, their laziness, their wealth, or their poverty. Some rise at a very early hour, and breakfast by candle-light; some lie in bed till ten, and breakfast at   English and French Breakfasts.   65 at eleven. Some breakfast off one dish, alternating between meat and fish; others must have every variety on the, table at one time. We have settled down into no fixed national habits. Now, in England, among the upper classes-including the merchants and manufacturers-there is the general custom of breakfasting by or before nine o'clock, and there is more constant adherence to standard dishes than we find elsewhere. An Englishman could hardly eat breakfast without bacon. He knows nothing of our ham, and would be horrified at the thick slices of the smoked article which are served up like steaks, hete-especially in our cheap boarding- houses. His bacon, air-dried and salted, is cut in thin slices, and quickly cooked and browned on the gridiron. Tender, sweet and crisp, it makes a most excellent relish, with good bread and butter. Then come eggs, always cooked in the shell, and always soft. The Englishman cooks his eggs himself; the boiler, full of hot water, is brought to the table-a fashion becoming common here. A juicy mutton- chop, a hot muffin, a roast potato, and tea or coffee, make out a pretty substantial meal." "I should think so," said Vohlen. "But the Englishman rarely changes. He may prefer',a bit from a cold joint to the mutton, but his bacon and eggs are as certain as the breakfast itself. He cares nothing for what we call 'kickshaws;' for the hashes and stews, the omelettes and fricassees, with which we comfort the morning hour. And there is a singular unanimity of sentiment throughout the kingdom. If a man can't have the bacon and mutton, he takes at least the bacon; and, if he can't have the 5     "     Romance of the Table. egg, he tries at least to compass the potato-while many a breakfast is made with the potato alone, and a cup of coffee. The uniformity of diet among English- men may account for the singular likeness which they bear to each other. An Englishman is known every- where; he belongs to a type: solid, somewhat heavy, but tenacious, wrapped up in Albionic self-conceit, and doubtful of the progress of any other part of the world. If you go among the very wealthy, there is more arrogancy, and less of that disposition to make friendships, than we find among other people. "Now, let us contrast the stubborn English with the mercurial French. Is it not possible that eating has something to do with the wonderful dissimilarity? There are but a few miles between the two nations, yet in climate, as well as in personal appearance and habits, the change is very striking. The Englishman takes his lunch after his breakfast; the Frenchman before it. Often h/ takes his coffee and bread before he ri es, or, if no , immediately after. His breakfast comes at noon, or thereabouts, and he indulges in omelettes, fish, stews, fried or stewed potatoes, and the inevitable claret-without which no regular meal would be complete. Whatever the Frenchman may indulge in, however, it will be noticed that there is far less heavy, solid food than his neighbor partakes of. The bread is baked in long rolls, giving plenty of crust, land a spongy lightness of interior; and the French eat twice as much bread as the English. Then, he likes a variety of little dishes, and is horrified at the sight of a large and half-cooked chop or steak; and if he eats either, it is served up en papilotte, and is small, tender, and well done. The whole would not be a   Eng-lish and French Breakfasts.   67 mouthful for a hearty Englishman. If he has beef, he eats nothing but the tenderloin) which in France is always sold separate from the rest of the meat. He is fond of cresses and dwarf radishes, and winds up with some preserves or a jelly." The Professor hesitated a moment, as though he had spoken already too long; but, noticing the interest with which the company were listening, he resumed: "It is hard to tell to what to attribute the difference between the English and French; whether it is to be sought for in difference in species, as we find it in animals; whether in climate, or in the confirmed habits of the people, derived from their ancestors. As wine is a native of France, and the English cannot produce it, they took to making beer; and, the climate being cold and wet, to drinking whisky and other spirits, and strong wines. The grosser stimulants may have had something to do with the grosser eating. Eng- land has superior pasturing land; the French, little or none-most of the land being cultivated. As the beef and mutton are the finest in the world, they naturally become the staple articles of food, and seem to assimilate with the beverages I have spoken of; and the two make the Briton the solid man, physically and mentally, and the substantial farmer, mechanic, or merchant, with whom all the world is acquainted; while the French assimilate their food to their light drinkables, and develop a style of thought as different as can readily be imagined. Whether either is a proper model to follow, I have my doubts. There is a just and happy medium between them, perhaps." "Indeed," said Florence, "the subject grows inter-     68     Romance of t/he Tabce. esting; but what a multitude of questions arose t', my lips while you were speaking, Professor! I would so much like to know which is the true way to live. Is wine a proper or wholesome drink, even for the French? Is beer good for the English, and is it advisable to partake of so much meat as they devour? Is it possible to be strong and healthy, and enjoy life, without meat? What is the proper hour to breakfast, and--" "Stop! stop!" cried the Professor. "You may exercise your undoubted woman's right to question, but do not propound too many at once. Which of the six do you most wish to have answered?" "Well, that about wine." "That," said the Professor, "may open the entire subject of temperance-one which would take more time and wisdom to solve than I am possessed of. Pure red wine does not seem to hurt the Frenchman who drinks it-and that is about all I can say regarding it. There is no doubt that the human stomach can become seasoned to anything not abso- lutely destructive in its nature. Do you not think so, Doctor?" "Yes," replied the Doctor; but that does not excuse the use of an article which is expensive, and which exercises no positive benefit on the human system; of course, I mean as a beverage. Yet if, as has been urged, the light wines of France stand between the drinker and strong drinks, such as brandy, then I should consider claret a blessing. It would be a blessing still greater, if they drank it far more sparingly than they do.

There was a very pleasant re-union on the Wednes- day evening when Dr. Sollinger was to give his essay on "Tea and Coffee," and so many young people "just dropped in" on the occasion as to quite fill the dining-room. "You see the ruling passion, Doctor," said Flor- ence. "Tea is a weakness with ladies, and coffee with gentlemen; and the two sexes unite in defense of either, or both, when there is any chance of war." "I am not sure," replied Doctor Sollinger, "that there will be any war. I am very far from deciding that coffee and tea are injurious. How often have we impressed upon us that 'circumstances alter cases,' with another very safe old adage, that ' What is one man's meat is another man's poison?' I have learned to be very charitable and forgiving, and the more so, having so many weaknesses of my own. Some of the most noted scientific men of this and other times defend the moderate use of tobacco, as retarding the   About Tea and Coffee.      71 consumption of the tissues of the human body; and there is scarcely a doubt that it leads to a prolonga- tion of life in old people, who are addicted to its use, in whom digestion acts sluggishy. The mysteries of life are very wonderful, and I am not self-conceited enough to arrogantly determine what another shall receive or reject. We all agree in preaching mod- eration, and, beyond that, a total abstinence from all things which have a positive bad effect upon the system. "Tea and coffee," continued the Doctor, glancing at a few notes on a bit of paper, "have excited an immense amount of attention and investigation, from the simple fact that they are so extensively used, and that no une can tell how they came into use. And there is another cause for scientific exploration: the identity of two elements, which are the souls of the plants-theine, in tea, and cajfeine, in coffee. Nothing in taste or odor can be more different than the berry and the leaf; yet it is these elements which give them their attractiveness as beverages, and their power for good or evil. Does it not give us an astonishing view of the workings of Nature, when we learn how fair and how simple are her agencies, yet how she weaves them together in endless ways for the sus- tenance and gratification of man? Take wine, for example, the varieties of which are almost endless; yet, when analyzed, about all we can find are water, acid, alcohol and sugar. That which the connoiseur prizes the most highly-the fragrance, the boquet, the delicate aroma which rests so pleasantly upon the tongue-is sought for in vain. We might as well look for the sun in the flower.     72     Romance of the Table. "So with tea and coffee; we find a larger list of elementary substances-such as resin, woody fiber, gum, wax, tannin, etc. Yet, after all, that little agent, occupying so small a corner as almost to escape detection, is the wheel within a good many wheels which has brought these two articles into such a relation with the world. Take out the nicotine from tobacco, the alcohol from wine, and they would be discarded as worthless. Take out theine and caffeine ,rrom tea and coffee, and the morning meal would lose its charm to one half the world. "The fact that something of the kind is needed might be fairly drawn from the truth that tea and coffee have been found. There is a necessity for liquids, to assist in the digestion of food; and, as Providence has endowed us with the exquisite faculty of taste, so we go abroad, ransacking Nature for that which will supply the necessity while gratifying the sense. Nay, we are not even satisfied with adminis- tering to the taste. If we find, on entering the break- fast-room, that delicious odor which follows the making of a true cup of coffee, there is a new sensa- tion, which seems to appeal to the appetite and add a charm to life. Heat is life; cold is death. On a hot cup of coffee, the' laborer can endure both cold and fatigue; but cold coffee is less pleasant. "Yet, it cannot be denied that coffee and tea, especially the latter, act too powerfully upon some organizations to be considered healthful; and, were we to decide in accordance with certain phenomena we have witnessed, we should reject them as danger- ous. Some persons cannot take tea at all, without producing a highly nervous and cerebral action.

Others can partake moderately, say one or two cups, but beyond that they, too, suffer, while Dr. Johnson is said to have drank twenty-five cups at one meal! We find, too, that as tobacco is benefi6ial to the aged, so are tea and coffee. In fact, the very articles which we are sometimes taught are poisons-and which are so, to many young people-are the most powerful- agents in sustaining life, at later periods. Champagne wine was almost the entire nourishment of an aged invalid for weeks. "But we all labor under the difficulty of being slaves to the deceitful traders. The demand for tea and coffee is so great, and so constant, as to have aroused the cupidity of dealers, and no little ingenuity has been expended in the effort to supply the purchaser with anything but what he thinks he is buying. I do not know whether coffee has been sold without any coffee in it; but, certainly, dealers have gone as far in that direction as they could-and keep the consumer in a state of blissful ignorance. "In coffee, everything in any way approximating thereto is used. Beans are the favorite article; peas, acorns, chestnuts, yellow-flag, stale bread and sea biscuit, and raisins, roots and seeds. Of course, these can only be used safely in coffee burnt and ground, ready for use; but this has gradually been an increasing trade, and in purchasing it thus, the purchaser unwittingly assists in deceiving himself. We see coffee advertised under fancy names, beauti- fully put up and labeled, and often sold at less than the cost of the genuine berry. If the consumer is     74     Romance of the Table. satisfied with what he gets, no one else, surely, will complain; but there is no article yet discovered which takes the place of coffee, and nothing can be made to do so, without a skillful disguise of its true taste or qualities. Very poor coffee is used, and coloring matters employed to give it the appearance of the best. "The article most employed, however, in coffee adulteration is chicory, the root of a plant called, in botany, cichorium intybus. Gradually the taste of people has been so changed that the bitterness of this root has been an evidence of the quality of coffee, and the true article would be considered deficient without it. Millions of pounds of chicory are used in France alone, annually, and probably as much in this country and in England. "Chicory has no caffeine, or the aromatic oil of coffee, but it contains a large proportion of sugar-at least thirty per cent-and, in burning, this sugar gives off that bitter, aromatic taste which the palate of the drinker craves. We find this burnt-flavor taste frequently in beer, and always in porter. "Possibly the tannin, which forms so large a part of tea and coffee, may have something to do with their physiological effects upon the system; but this is not positively decided. Some dealers in patent coffee- pots aim to extract the tannin from it, and hold up any evidence of success as proof positive that the world is now safe in partaking its favorite beverage; but I doubt much whether any process can take any thing away and leave the vi -tues of coffee intact. Nature is not thus to be trifled with. There is, no doubt, merit in some of these contrivances; but their   About Tea and Coffee.      75 true merit, if they have any, is in developing all the charms of the berry. Thus, a roasting apparatus should be air-tight, so as to prevent the escape of the aroma, and thus enable the cook to appeal to the nose. The roasting should be perfect, so as to avoid burning-coffee should be roasted, not burnt. Then, in applying hot water, it should be done without steeping or boiling the coffee. The quicker it is made and drank, the better the condition, and the greater. the enjoyment of the drinker. "Every one, who knows how to read, knows some- thing, at least, of the preparation of tea-that wonder- ful little plant, whose leaves-if not given for the healing of the nations-have been given for their delectation. All the varieties of tea are from the same plant. There is no green tea-plant, or black tea-plant. The tea may vary somewhat, according to the locality in which it is grown; but the principal differences we note in the tea of commerce are the result of manipulation and curing. Green tea is the young leaf, cured by heat immediately after gather- ing; while black tea is an older leaf, which is allowed to remain some hours, until it is wilted. The leaf turns black by exposure to the air, and fermentation. There is much done to tea, also, to prepare it for a foreign market and depraved tastes; but the Chinese never drink such teas themselves. Tumeric, Prussian blue, and gypsum, are used in coloring teas; and it is a popular idea, how well founded I do not know, that copper and other oxides are employed for the same purpose. It is perfectly credible, however, that a good many other leaves, besides those of the tea-plant, come from China; and I dare say a good many pro-     76     Romance of the Table. cesses for disguising them are employed of which we know little. If the Chinese can cheat us in any way, we may be sure they will do it-without even those slight twinges of conscience which a Christian may be supposed to feel. It is said, on very good authority, that tea-leaves once used have been 'doctored,' and sold the second time; and the Chinese make up an artificial mixture of tea-dust, paste and dirt, which they call by the very appropriate name of ' Lie-tea.' "I hardly think it necessary for me to say much more on this subject, although I have not exhausted it. It will be seen that I have drawn no positive conclusions which will interfere with the exercise of judgment on the part of any one. Tea-drinkers and coffee-drinkers may go on as they have heretofore. I would only urge them to that moderation in the use of those beverages as I would in all other things. If tea and coffee affect the nerves, and cause restlessness and sleepless nights, they should be avoided, or drank very weak. I would also urge great care in purchas- ing. If there is injury in their employment, that injury should not be addled to by impure adulterations. If I ask for wine, I do not want cheap'brandy or corn- whiskey. If I drink coffee, I do not want split peas or old biscuit, and I decidedly object to an infusion of copper in my tea."   CH A PTER     XIII. A SUNDAY MORNING BREAKFAST. The turnpike-road to people's hearts, I find, Lies through their mouths, or I mistake mankind. -Peter Pildar. The Sabbath day has been called a day of rest; it is so, more in the sense of change of labor than in absolute cessation from it. The healthy, hearty, active man can never be entirely still, and, even if his body is indolent, his mind is active-active and restless; thinking, planning, stretching back to all that is inter- woven with the past, forward to all that concerns the future. The better the Christian, the harder the worker. The man of the world may lie on his back, yawn and smoke; the woman of the world dawdle in slipshod undress over a novel, or dreamingly dwell on the hundred worldly things that are to fill up the prospective week; but the Christian has his church  and his Sunday-school; his visits of charity, friendship, condolence. I have known the Sabbath to be such a day of work, that the coming one was, in comparison, the day of rest. Habit makes any kind of labor light, while that which is seeming pastime, is a load indeed, when fairly undertaken. But, take the Sabbath as we will, it comes with the balm of restoration. We feel that for one day, at least. we are free, and that there are no secular calls upon us which we must imperatively heed. The morning     78     Romance of the Table. sleep is refreshing, for we are not forced to listen to the striking of the clock, or look to the hands of the watch, in the gray of the morning. The breakfast may he an hour late without manifest impropriety; and it is so delicious to put on the morning-gown and slippers with the feeling that they are the domestic evidences of freedom. Thomas and his wife were at the table, on a Sabbath morning, and they were eating slowly and pleasantly, conversing as husband and wife should do. The sun came in through the half-closed blinds, with the apparent desire to meet the lazy fire in the grate half- way. The help had her breakfast and was gone to mass, and the young couple thought they might while away an hour, if they chose, without being hurried, or called to a strict account. "What is life without you are happy?" said Thomas, in a tone which showed that the words he used were a quotation. "Nothing, I should say," replied Florence. "I can conceive of existence without happiness, but not of life. Some people never live at all." "There is something very odd about it," said Thomas. Every day is very much like every other day. We go through a certain amount of thinking, of work, of eating and drinking, of elation and depression; and when the day comes to an end, we sink wearily to rest. Now, were we to live a hundred years we could do no more, and experience no less. There are variations of sensation, of course, and a quickening of perception, or a deadening of feeling- just as we have used our faculties. Still, there is a family likeness between all the days of the year, and   A Sunday Morning Breakfast.     79 between the daily experiences of us all. Can you call to mind any event of such startling importance, during the past week, as to make the day on which it happened remarkable?" "No, I think not. I can only remember a succes- sion of pleasant thoughts and minor events; and they have alta sort of dreamy film over them, as though they were vanishing away into shadow-land. Yet, life is sweet after all; the mere fact of living is a solace, and I am sure I do not object to living a little while longer-do you?" "No, dear, no. I was only thinking, that if any one should attempt to make a romance of our daily lives, what a humdrum sort of an affair it would be! Yet the majority of lives are very similar to our own. I am told that the great painters and sculptors, if they wish to make a perfect human form-that is, one ideally perfect-have to take the limbs of one model, the head of another, the bust of a third; and then, after all, there are many demands of Art which Nature does not supply, and they have to call upon the imagina- tion to make up all deficiencies. So it is with novel- writers; they take a stick here and a stick there, and they dovetail together all they can muster of fact and fancy, just to. make up one little history." "Would you like to live such a life of romance?" queried Florence. "No, thank you. I think that is the best life which, on the whole, is the most useful, and gives us day by day the most inward satisfaction. I do not like the idea of passing away without having' done something for mankind. I should like to leave the world just a little better than I found it. The death of the body is not     80     Romance of the Table. such a terrible thing, if we know that we continue to live in the hearts of others, and that our names are on the roll of the world's benefactors." "We seem to have fallen into somewhat of an odd current," said Florence. "These Wednesday evening meetings are very pleasant; but it would amuse the world to know that we could find nothing better to interest ourselves with than dissertations on bread- raising." "Well, suppose you vary the subject by a disserta- tion on puddings. But, really, I am a good deal interested. I do not know that I care more about food, or the mere pleasure of eating, than others. I am not a very troublesome customer, am I?" "Not near so troublesome as I expected to find you." "Thank you! I care more for our meals as a means of social intercourse than I do for them in themselves. A pig rushes to the trough, and has the utmost animal enjoyment, combined with the utmost selfishness; a wise man partakes of the humblest food thankfully, if it administers to his social pleasures-that is the difference. We hardly ever hear of dyspepsia where people sit long at the table, and while away the time in rational conversation; but the man who rushes to his meals, and loads his stomach as he would a cart, has only himself to thank if his future life is embit- tered by bodily sufferings." "Is it not odd that you and I should have-both abjured tea and coffee?" Yes, especially when to do so is a very rare excep- tion to the rule."   A Sunday AMorninzg Breakfast.    81 "Do you really think they are injurious to the health?" "Not invariably so. The human system seems to accommodate itself to a great many things which are seemingly detrimental; and climate and our nerves have much to do with it. A cup of tea almost drives me wild; yet an old and feeble person, accustomed to it, can drink tea not only with impunity, but it becomes absolutely indispensable. See how men become used to tobacco-and some very old folks almost live upon it; yet you and I would be made sick with the slightest experiment. There is abso- lutely no rule which will apply to all alike. I saw, not long since, two small books-one demonstrating that alcohol is an absolute poison, and cannot be taken into the system without injury; the other, that Nature demands a certain daily amount, and is all the better for it." "It is all very curious," said Florence, "and the mysteries of Nature are very wonderful. If we look at the matter very closely, there is something abhor- rent in meat-eating; taking life in order to preserve it; killing the birds of the air, the fish of the sea, and the cattle upon a thousand hills, that they may minis- ter to our appetites and pleasures. Is meat absolutely essential?" "The same explanation applies to meat, as to other things. Habit makes an article essential which other- wise would not be. When you see Dr. Sollinger, who is to be introduced to our circle soon, you will see a most wonderful physical development in a man who, I believe, does not know the taste of meat-fish, flesh, or fowl. He is in a part of the profession, too, 6     82     Romance of the Table. drawing very heavily upon his nerves and vital forces; yet his health and strength are excellent. But he and his system will come in review before us, shortly, and a most interesting system we shall find it. Let us adjourn. Where shall we go to church this morning?" "I should like to hear Dr. Tyng." "Agreed. Perhaps, some day, we shall have a settled faith, as well as others. We are young enough, however, to watch and wait."   CHAPTER XIV. INTRODUCES DR. SOLLIN GER. Spare in diet; Free from gross passions or of mirth or anger; Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood; Garnish'd and deck'd with modest compliment; Not working with the eye, without the ear, And, but in purged judgment, trusting neither. -Shakespeare. There was a full circle in the drawing-room on the evening appointed for the appearance of Dr. Sollinger; but, while curiosity was undoubtedly uppermost, no one would have suspected that the new arrival was not an old acquaintance, and a regular contributor to the social pleasures of those who had been already introduced. There is a quiet way of making a stranger feel at home, and the Mayhews understood it perfectly. But any one could see, at the first glance, that Dr. Sollinger was an oddity and a curiosity. A round, full face, yet rosy; a good eye, a large, well-balanced cranium, and long, snow-white hair, gave him the appearance we usually attribute to St. Nicholas; or he might pass for October, or an elderly Bacchus- mythological deities who sometimes find their proto. types on earth. Jolly, an Englishman would call him, and his figure was in harmony with his face. Rather short and heavy, with broad shoulders and a large chest, there were evidences in his well-knit form ot     84     Romance of the Table. great animal vigor and a well-balanced organism. His temperament was what I may call the sanguine- bilious-a temperament which unites quick percep- tions and stubburn resolution, together with patience, and a certain amount of good-humor. In fact, the Doctor rather prided himself on his wit, which, if not al- ways pungent, was not by any means devoid of point. There was a good deal of egotism in the Doctor's manner and conversation; but, as he was destined by Nature to be a central figure in any circle, and the object of both curiosity and attention, his self-esteem was not so much out of place as it otherwise would have been; and it is well to say, also, that he had but little book-education, and that what he had achieved was the result of a developing force with which the schools have nothing to do. He had, probably, thought a good deal; and he showed a nice discrim- ination of causes and effects, with a happy way of elevating his own theories by satirizing those of others. He was, in short, a natural physician, not a made one; with some weaknesses, he had amazing powers of control over himself and his patients. and a daring in his treatment of disease which, if not allied to great powers of healing, would have led to disas- trous failure. He intuitively knew his own strength, and he successfully used it. What more can be done by any man? As, in the progress of this work, I shall have frequent occasion to let Dr. Sollinger speak f6r himself, it will only be necessary to glance at his theories here, and that simply as a more complete introduction of the man; for I am describing a real, and not an imaginary, character.   Introduces Dr. Sollinger.     85 Dr. Sollinger's system, then, was a partial restorao tion of the ancient Biblical treatment of laying-on of hands. His wonderful nervous power, his perfectly immovable and concentrated will, had the same effect to bring about an equilibrium of the vital forces of the patient, as well as the impartation of his own strength to the feeble and diseased. As a body surcharged with electricity imparts its surplus to the first conductor which presents itself, so Dr. Sollinger, full of animal vigor and the electricity of life, im- parted his own surplus health to others, drawing it again from the earth and the air. He seemed to be a perpetual reservoir for health to flow into, and, how- ever great the tax upon his powers, there was always something left behind. But f am aware that mere mountebanks, professing to possess mysterious powers, have often appeared; and I must do the Doctor the justice to say that he is not to be classed with any of these. His restorations were not suddenly performed, and partook only of the marvelous as demonstrative of the fact that Nature is superior, as a restorer of health, to Art. The great secret of the Doctor's success lay in the fact that he began his work by instilling Christian patience into the minds of those whom he undertook to cure-a reliance upon the goodness of God, and the necessity of resignation to His will. It was a principle of action with him that the stubborn will must yield, and the stiff neck be bent, as an introduction to a cure; and his first lesson was, to bend the head upon the breast, to "drop it," as he said, and to remain thus for hours in quiet reverie and contemplation. I speak now of those deeply-seated chronic complaints over which     86     Romance of thze Table. medicine has failed to exercise a power. In recent and acute diseases his active treatment surpassed that of ordinary physicians, and was quite as successful. Medicine Dr. Sollinger never gave. He looked upon it, in all its forms, with loathing and contempt. He would, energetically enter the lists against the most renowned disciples of Esculapius, and he triumphed in argument quite as much as he did in practice. "Doctors," he would say, "send me the patients they cannot cure, and I restore them to health; it would be strange, indeed, if a practice so successful should be weak in theory." The Doctor was a vegetarian; not a "Grahamite," exactly, but as utterly opposed to meat, or any kind of flesh-diet, as he was to drugs. Still, outside of that and the use of liquors in any form, he was what may be called a generous liver. Of such food as he con- sidered wholesome he ate largely, and his own personal strength, and extraordinary uniformity of health, attested the value of his dietary principles. He loved the potato as an Englishman does a steak, or a Frenchman a potage; and, had he been a poet, he would have sung its praises in many a ballad; and that he did grow poetical in describing his favorite esculent may be seen in the essay which comes next in order. If I describe the Doctor in these pages as a sort of nonsuch, I do it designedly; for I do not wish him to be classed with the clairvoyants, the water-cure physicians, or the miracle-workers. He stands by himself, and is to be looked upon as a rarity, whether we do or do not fancy him or his system. Having Lrought him thus far forward in our history, we will let him talk for himself hereafter.   CHAPTER XV. THE SONG OF THE POTATO, Let the sky rain potatoes; * * hail Kissing comfits, andsnow eringoes. -Merry Wives of Windsor.. Luxury, with her potato finger. -Troilus and Cressida. Dr. Sollinger never wrote, but he spoke fluently, and with that perfect comprehension of the subject which results from a thorough mental analysis of it. He had been duly informed what would be expected from him, and, without effort, he glided so imperceptibly into his theme, that it seemed but a continuation of the subject on which they had been conversing. It was very, very pleasant to look around upon that little social circle, and note the fire of intellectual pleasure, rather than thought, with which each countenance was animated, Lifted from the frivolous topics which ordinarily engage the attention and occupy the time of people, it is wonderful what a transformation takes place, and how much more nearly men and women approximate to that standard of humanity in which the Heavenly Architect is truly glorified. "A rapid glance at mankind," said Dr. Sollinger, ' reveals wonders worthy of our contemplation, and there are some facts which seem to contravene princi- ples which have been considered infallible. Man, in killing and devouring animals, shows his identity with     88     Romance of the Table. them, rather than his superiority; yet the argument is, that a meat diet is not only essential to life, but a wise provision of Nature to keep down the increase of the brute creation. We eat them to prevent their eating us! The wild animal of the forest acts from the same premises, though he does not stop to reason thereupon; and his nature, his thirst for blood-which he greedily laps-and his love of flesh, with which he is hardly ever satisfied, is a part of his very being; and he is savage and brutal just in accordance with the amount he is capable of devouring. Note, too, one resemblance between the animal and man: The animal, when he is gorged, lies stupid and half torpid, and in that state might be easily destroyed. Man, too, when he is gorged with half-cooked beef and mutton, becomes heavy, lethargic, and so drowsy that it is difficult for him to keep awake. With an opportunity he drops asleep, and his heavy, stertorous breathing indicates anything but a clear brain or a well-treated stomach. Take the lower classes of men, like the Bushmen of Africa, and others of whom I have read, and they, after the fashion of the lion and the tiger, will so fill themselves to repletion that they are like drunken men, only more absolutely sottish and stupid. I am not sure, but I may, at least, entertain the doubt, whether apoplexy ever attacks any but those who have been accustomed to a diet of meat; and that in abundance with all the concomitants which come under the head of 'generous living.' "Now, it is useless to deny the fact that carnivorous  animals are so by inheritance, and that their natures  cannot be changed; but neither can it be denied that the nature of man is only partially inherited, and   The Song of te Potato.     89 mainly acquired. He forms his own appetites, as he forms his own religious or moral character. The argument that meat is necessary to sustain life, or to give strength, I, at least, hold to be a fallacy. The tiger eats meat, it is true, and he is strong; but the elephant does not, and he has a strength proportioned to his bulk. The horse needs none, the patient camel needs none, the ox none; yet what surpasses them for strength and endurance? The Esquimaux and the Greenlander devour enormous quantities of animal food, yet look at their deminutive bodies and half idiotic minds. What they eat produces the fire in the blood which enables them to resist intense cold. The object is accomplished; they eat their dozen pounds of blubber in a day, and wash it down with train-oil; the result is that they keep their bodies alive, and that is all we can say in their favor. "What man really needs in the shape of food is that which is most readily absorbed into the system, and most readily produces the bones and tissues of the body, which are constantly wasting away. With this, a variety is needed to appease and gratify the sense of taste; but note one important truth: the healthier the appetite, the greater the variety which is at our disposal. The perverted appetite is satisfied with nothing. Meat is tasteless, and strong mustards and other condiments are restored to. Even the potato must be served up in some violent and outrageous fashion, as unlike itself as possible, to satisfy the palate of the unhappy gormand. "That man, on the contrary, whose blood runs pure; whose digestion is always good; whose head is always clear; whose hand is steady and step elastic,      I 90     Romance of the Table. needs no brandy before dinner or sherry with it; his morning sky is of a roseate hue without looking at it through a glass of bitters; and he has all the produc- tions of the earth from which to increase his joys, without the desire to add thereto by taking the life of any of God's creatures. But the love of that man, so far as his table is concerned, is centered upon the potato. "And look at the analogy between the potato and its use. The use of all food is to replace the waste of the body-of that body which must eventually go entirely to decay, and become absorbed in its kindred earth. What more proper than that it should be mainly sustained by that which the earth most readily produces, which grows in abundance beneath or upon its surface, and requires but the healthy care and labor of man? All that man needs, either for suste- nance or pleasure, are the immediate products of our fertile mother. In the destruction of animal life in order to add thereto, he intrudes upon the domain of those who follow brute instincts, for the want of that reason and science witA which man is gifted. "The potato is the king of vegetables, in that it possesses the constituent elements of the human body which it is designed to nourish. Its basis is water in its liquid, and starch in its solid form; but the water is not thrown off in cooking, as it is from other articles of which it is a component part, but it unites in such a way with the solid and nutritive portions as to perform a most important service. Starch, when chemically reduced, is carbon, oxygen and hydrogen; and, as in starch the two latter elements are in the same proportion as in water, it may be said that \   The Song of the Potato.     9 starch is nothing but charcoal and water; yet, united as it is with sugar, and the balancing properties of other substances-all brought together in that mys- terious way which man can only gaze upon with wonder and admiration, but cannot imitate-it can  be reduced to the elements of the human body, and it reproduces those elements. What more do we need? "But the potato performs its mission without being accompanied with the elements of destruction. Its nutritive qualities do not carry with them pains to the head through fever in the blood. We can obtain nourishment from meat, and temporary fire from wine, but the after results do not bear a healthy record. The stomach, over-loaded and over-stimulat- ed, rebels, and revenges itself upon the foolish individ- ual who thus tampers with his life. We are a nation of dyspeptics, but there is no dyspepsia in a potato; we are a nation of tiplers, but there is no intoxication in water; we are a nation of invalids, but ft is rare to find disease among the strictly temperate. "The potato has a desideratum which no other article of food possesses in like proportions: its combination. of quality with quantity, nourishment with bulk. Here is a point on which too great stress cannot be laid; and it is wonderful how this point is ignored by men of science. The aim seems to be to see how far food can be concentrated, not expanded, forgetful of the fact that the stomach is an organ needing expansion and exercise quite as much as the lungs. The Hindoo holds up his arm until it withers for want of its natural position and employment, and we in some cases recommend the reduction of the     92     Romance of the Table. stomach to a state of deathly inaction, which we foolishy call rest. We may as well say the heart needs rest. The rest of the stomach in dyspepsia is the cause of its troubles, and the use of concentrated food is a nail in the patient's coffin. The greatest trial the stomach has to endure is in a surfeit of food, especially such food as a hearty meat-eater indulges in, and often that reduced quantity which gives it painful but not healthy labor. A strong system may stand one, and a delicate system endure the other for a long while, but the end can be easily told. "Let it be remembered, too, that constipation is directly traceable to concentrated food and to indi- gestible meals. The more inert the stomach becomes, the more it is incapable of healthy action, the less is it capable of acting upon food; of breaking it up and preparing it for its succeeding changes in the system, and of expelling it by contractile power.. This can be readily seen without much explanation; and those physicians-I hope the number is few-who con- stantly advise their constipated and dyspeptic patients to eat rare beefsteaks and drink beer and porter, are responsible for aggravations of those diseases, which they seem powerless to cure. I think, too, that the most painful of diseases, neuralgia, comes from that same difficulty, and .that the weak secretions and unhealthy action of the liver are also traceable to the weakened condition of the organs of digestion. "If we wish to blow a fire into a flame with the bellows, we open them to admit the air, and then we expel it with the same force. How much of a fire could be obtained if we opened the bellows but a   The Song of the Potato.     93 quarter of an inch? And what can we expect from the delicate organism of the human system if it is allowed to remain torpid and inactive? "The potato expands the stomach and gives it activity. The myriad mouths through which that organ and the intestines seize upon food, and carry life throughout the system, come again into play, and they find in the potato what the system needs, and not the seeds of death and disease. The blood is not turned into a river of liquid fire, which, dying out, leaves man a blackened log upon earth's surface, but he feels within him the quickening impulses of a regen- erated life and the aspirations of a new humanity. Now, the potato comes to us with the solid flesh and bone-creating qualities of bread and other farinacious substances, and it comes to us, also, with bulk. You cannot either create a fever by its use or sustain one. Of course, I speak of the potato well cooked-not transformed by art and epicurianism into a different thing. "Of course, there is no use for me to sing the song of the potato to those whose appetites are pampered and vitiated. The man accustomed to a flesh diet clings to it with a desperate tenacity; but still, the truths of science may modify our action, if they do not entirely reverse it. We may open the eyes of coming generations, if we cannot convert the present. I talk of the potato as though it was the only sub- stantial article of food; but such is not the case, and I only use it now as a kind of central orb around which my sanitary world revolves. Let me cook you a ipotato; let me heap upon your dish the white flakes.     "     Romance of the Table. which look almost like new-fallen snow-only they are hot, not cold. Let me add thereto the sweetest bread; the solid hominy or wheaten grits; the richest milk and cooling fruits; let me gratify every healthy taste, while I satisfy every reasonable demand of appetite, and you will then see that my praise of the potato is none too great, and that it deserves an epic poem, instead of a prosy essay."   CHAPTER XVI. HOW TO COOK THE POTATO. They are used to be eaten roasted in the ashes; some, when they be roasted, infuse them and sop them in wine; and others, to give them greater grace in eating, do boil them with prunes and eat them, --Gerard, A D. 1590. "And now," said Vohlen, bluntly, "I think I shall sing the song of the buckwheat cake, that glorious production of the housewife and the griddle; that compound of carbon, oxygen and nitrogen, to which we add Stewart's No. i Syrup and an oleaginous compound called butter. Why, O Doctor! should not buckwheat be as nutritious as the potato-its elements being so nearly the same? I don't see, after all, that we eat anything but charcoal and water! O, glorious science, which thus dispels our fond illusions, and turns the feasts of kings into burned cork and Adam's ale!" "Well," replied Dr. Sollinger, "let me tell you the difference. Take buckwheat cakes, and allow them to get cold, and a day after they have been baked try to make a breakfast of them; I am of the opinion that the coldest of cold potatoes will be a luxury, in com- parison. Your cakes will not be exactly all dough, but they will be a closer approximation to leather than your stomach will care about appropriating. A potato, on the contrary, loses nothing by standing, but when warmed over again, with a little butter or salt, is even more palatable than it was at first. Now, there is but little in the buckwheat cake itself which     96     Romance of the Table. is attracti7e, at any time. It is the neat, which is pleasant in cold weather, with the butter and molasses more particularly to tickle the palate. If this heavy, solid, substance, with its conglomerate of oil and sugar, does not tax the digestive powers, then is the ability of the ostrich to digest nails and stones not fabulous." "But why, Doctor," said Florence, "should there be such a difference in the nutritive qualities of articles, the component parts of which are so nearly the same?" "Why is there such a difference between charcoal and the diamond?" replied the Doctor. "Their elements are the same. The fact is, that the mysteries of Nature are very profound, and the solution of the question is not so easy. Buckwheat has less starch and more gluten than the potato, and the union of its parts is different. In itself, buckwheat is well enough as an article of food; but the difficulty is in its preparation. No wholesome method has ever been discovered; and, as I have said, it is used mainly as a vehicle for conveying sweets, as we use pickles of various kinds for conveying sours. When the powers of digestion are ordinarily strong, buckwheat produces no visible ill effects, without it may be a breaking out upon the skin; but I would certainly advise plenty of potatoes to be eaten with it." "But you have not told us yet how to cook a potato," said Doctor Lorton. "I think," replied Dr. Sollinger, "I might refer that question to Mrs. Mayhew." "No," said Florence, "I am but a novice; besides, there are nearly as many ways of cooking a potato as of cooking an egg."   How to Cook the Potato.     97 "I do not know that I have any method of cooking," said Dr. Sollinger, "not familiar to others; and it is more proper for me to indicate my preference of known methods." "'First get your potato,' Mrs. Glass would say; I say, first secure a good potato-and there is a wide latitude of choice here, as elsewhere. The changes in the potato, the new varieties constantly introduced, and soil and climate, all have something to do with the production. The test of a potato is very simple. That which, with care and circumspection, boils 'dry,' as the saying is, is a good potato; but, if it comes out of the pot heavy; if it absorbs water too readily, and when beaten settles down into a paste, then reject it as worthless. We may as well eat unleavened bread as heavy potatoes. "But the potato itself being right, the next move is to peel it thinly and smoothly with a sharp knife. Cut in halves or quarters, so as to have the pieces the same size-this for uniformity of cooking. Drop in a pot of boiling water, having just enough to cover. When done, which can be determined with a fork, remove the vessel from the fire, pour off all the water, and return again to the stove. With a proper masher break up the potatoes, stirring constantly to allow the surplus water to escape. Add a little cream and salt while the beating progresses, and, if the process is properly finished, the potatoes will be turned out upon the dish a sight even for an-epicure. That is one way; but, to my mind, a well-roasted potato is an almost equal luxury. Roast with the skins on and break hot." 7     98     Romance of the Table. "Heat and motion are the elements of life," said Professor Tulford. "I have wondered often why we are so fond of hot victuals; but the reason is now obvious. Heat is life, and life is activity; and life seeks for that, even in our food, which corresponds to itself." "Except in hot weather," said Vohlen, "when ice- creams, ice-water and ice-lemonades or clarets, are in fashion. Your theory won't hold good, then." "Yes, it will," replied the Professor; "the law of life demands an equilibrium of the forces of Nature. When the body is very cold it demands fire-food, hot drinks, anything to restore the equilibrium. In summer, when the reverse is the case-when the blood is heated and the moisture of the body passes off in profuse perspiration-Nature seeks that which will reduce it to the average. But, in regard to food, we at all seasons prefer that which is freshy cooked to that which is cold and stale. There are exceptions, of course. Cold milk is preferred to hot, and so with a few other articles." "But would you advise us to give up meat entirely?" asked Mayhew. "No," replied Dr. Sollinger. "If an invalid comes to me for treatment, I change the diet at once, for that is a part of the treatment; but with others I advise a gradual curtailment. The system of a meat-eater has accustomed itself to its condition, and it is better tor us to humor it. I preach to all abstinence from flesh; but I am no more likely to convert the world from meat than are the temperance men to convert it from drink."   Irow to Cook the Potato.     99 "But the preaching of ultra doctrine," said Doctor Lorton, "has at least the merit of attracting public attention and of modifying public views. Moderate drinking is preferable to intemperance, and I doubt not that the evils of intemperance are lessened far beyond the absolute converts to teetotalism. If Dr. Sollinger could open as vigorous a crusade against gluttony, I truly believe that, if he did not abolish a flesh diet, he would vastly promote a moderate use there- of, and so perform a very great benefit to humanity." "So may it be," said Florence. "I will try to make a beginning, and will start with your boiled potatoes for breakfast to-morrow." "And I will write a poem in their praise," said Vohlen, "as soon as I can do without buckwheat." "You shall tell us another story," cried Florence. "I must be tempted with something better than a roasted potato," replied he; "but au revoir! let us sing the song of parting; for we have had a long session"'     CHAPTER     XVII. MORNING CALLS. If two gods should play some heavenly match, And on the wager lay two earthly women, And Portia one, there must be something else Pawn'd with the other ; for the poor, rude world Hath not her fellow.-Shlakespeare. Florence was happy in having an unusual allotment of friends, and was so eminently social herself that she was always delighted to have some of them call upon her. Thomas enjoyed it, too-not that he was often in the way when Florence was "at home;" but he loved to think that each day, while it brought its cares and duties to his wife, also brought that per centage of pleasures without which the happiest married life would be somewhat deficient. He knew that people who do not cultivate society become somber and misanthropical, and that it is only in harmonious assemblages that the usefulness of the individual can be fully developed. Man was not made to live alone, and neither on earth or in Heaven can we realize happiness in isolation. But Florence had a very large organ of discretion. She did not intend that her friends should interfere with her domestic avocations, or with her rest of body and mind. She believed that there is a time for all things-even for making morning calls, and she therefore followed the very praise-worthy example of those ladies who have set times and seasons for being "at home." And why should it not be so? Fre-   Morning Calls.   -10 l quently is it the case that ladies go along distance to see an acquaintance and find her out-on the same errand, possibly; while it just as frequently happens, that if the lady is at home the call is unseasonable, because unexpected, and is therefore not enjoyed. "You will be certain to find me at home on Tuesdays and Fridays," said Florence to her friends. And so it came to pass that on Tuesdays and Fridays the little Mayhew mansion presented quite a lively aspect. It cost nothing to see her friends. Her dress was plain and neat, as became her position; her parlor had a cosy appearance, heightened by a few fresh flowers of her own cultivation; and it was hardly possible to mistake the origin of other and more enduring ornaments which adorned the rooms. She had some very pretty crayon drawings upon the walls, and sev- eral of the chairs were covered with figures worked in cloth by her nimble fingers. Even the parlor boasted of a work-basket-for, of all stupid arrangements, Flor- ence believed that to be the most stupid which keeps the best room in the house for others to look at, but not for the use of the family. Her parlor windows were always open when there were any sunbeams to admit. Her piano was very rarely closed, and there was very often such a pleasant mingling of music, flowers and sunlight, that a pet canary hung in the window, from the way he sung, evidently thought he was in Arabia Felix. or some other paradise of birds. "But, my dear Florence," said Mrs. Timon; one morning, "I do not see how you can possibly have so much time to enjoy yourself. You keep but one girl. T helieve?"     102    Romance of the Table "Only one." "Yet you seem to have more leisure than those who keep two or three. How do you manage it?" "Perhaps because I keep but one," said Florence, laughing. "Some tell me that the more help we keep the more we haveto work ourselves." 'Well, we keep two-a cook and a chambermaid- and I am pestered to death. We are constantly changing, in hopes of doing better, and we are constantly doing worse. It takes me half the, time to break new servants into our ways; and, when they are useful, they leave us." "My troubles, maybe, are yet to come," replied Florence; "but so far I have made no change, and am very well satisfied. We all work according to a system. Before commencing housekeeping, or en- gaging a girl, I quietly wrote out some 'rules and regulations,' and put a copy in the kitchen. I said nothing about it to the help, but they are a perpetual reminder, and save a great deal of talking. You cannot expect a servant to remember all you tell her, and, if she is inclined to disobey, it is very convenient for her to forget verbal instructions." "Do let me see your 'rules and regulations.'" "Florence went to her writing-desk and produced the following paper, which Mrs. Timon read with an amused interest: Things to Remember. I. Work once done, and well done, is never to be done over again. 2. Work to be done cannot be done too quickly, and the more quickly it is done the more hours are there for rest.   Morning Calls.       1o3 3. It is easier to be regular than irregular. A good habit never weighs so heavily as X: bad one. 4. Impress the mind, before retiring for the night, with what is to be done in the morning, and have everything ready for beginning the day properly. "Is that all?" exclaimed Mrs. Timon, when she had finished reading. "I expected you to have at least ten commandments, with as many stern penalties for breaking them." '"Well," said Florence, "that is all I could think of. Of course there are many things a girl must learn by precept and example, and Rose and I have many pleasant little confabs together while we are sewing." "Do you mean to tell me you and your servant sew together?" "Yes; why not? I think it is capital. She is so delighted to get out of the kitchen, and have some one to talk to, that I have fallen into the habit of spending one hour in that way every day. Of course Rose would never come without being neat and tidy, and by taking some interest in her she is more apt to remain so at all times. Then, it gives me an oppor- tunity to instruct her in a way that is effective. We talk over matters in a social way, and discuss puddings and pies, and everything appertaining to family matters, as though she had a personal interest in them. We ought to remember that even poor Irish girls may have feelings, and can be worked upon by kindness." "Well, all that is quite new," said Mrs. Timon; "but, of course, you must work a good deal your- self?" '             104    Romance of the Table. "Not more than I like. I try to not let work accumulate, but take my own precautions. But -here come my sisters; they are always on hand, and it is so delightful to see them; and surely, if I am not mistaken, Mrs. Venables and her daughter have just passed the window." Very soon a fresh breath of air swept into the hall, and following it the fresh cheejks and sparkling eyes of the new arrivals. Then there was that outhurst of sense and nonsense, the latter rather predominating, which always marks the coming together of the fair sex. Talk of woman's rights as we may, and stand up for them, too, to the death, we cannot alter the fact that woman is woman and not man; that the same female element which in childhood leads a girl to choose a doll for a toy, and not a gun, is the dom- inating element in mature life. So the sober matrons talked, as usual, on the minor miseries of life; the fashions, the play and the last book; on the lectures of Professor Blot and the advantages of a co-operative kitchen. Then the younger visitors got Florence at the piano, and they waltzed as she played; then they followed that with a schottische, and then, the bell sounding again, they hurried on their bonnets and " wraps," as they called their outer habilinrents, and disappeared into the genial sunshine, leaving that incense of love behind them that seemed to illuminate the little parlor with the mellowed glow of happiness; the sanctified pres- ence of pure hearts even after their possessors had vanished.   Alornizng Calls.      105 Oh! that the difference between man and woman were not so great; the abyss not quite so profound! Oh! that the innocence of childhood; the perfume of tenderness and affection, could tone down the coarse- ness of masculine humanity, and bring love and wisdom into an undying union!     CHAPTER XVIII. A LITTLE MORE ABOUT BREAKFAST. I pr'ythee go, and get me some repast; I care not what, so it be wholesome food. -Katherine and Petruchio. I (the author, reader mine,) venture to speak for myself in this one chapter, and permit the other talkers to rest awhile, as why should they not? We will call this an off-night-when the doctors are attending to their patients; the Professor is engaged in a chemical analysis of a new substance to be used for mustard; Vohlen is writing his next story, and Thomas is reading some pleasant tale, while his wife is working-how beautiful she looks! She is engaged on something, I know not what it is, but it seems to be mainly made up of lace and an article which, I believe, the ladies call insertion. It is very pretty, and, now that she holds it up, it looks very much like a child's dress; but there is no child, so it can hardly be that. There is a very pleasant glow in the fire, and a very bright reflection therefrom in the face of the young wife-and the husband looks so happy! He is reading one of those stanzas from Mrs. Browning- "Sonnets from the Portuguese "-and his round, full voice, toned down to that nmPsical cadence in which a husband should read to his wifegives a depth of mean- ing to the words such as they could bear on no other occasion. Try it, reader, and see what you can make of it-although I assure you, if you do not feel the sentiment in your very soul, you will find it a puzzle: /   More about Breakfast.       o17 Let the world's sharpness, like a clasping knife, Shut in upon itself, and do no harm In this close hand of love, now soft and warm; And let us hear no sound of human strife After the click of shutting ; life to life- I lean upon thee, Dear, without alarm, And feel as safe as guarded by a charm Against the stab of worldling's, who, it rife, Are weak to injure. Very whitely still The lilies of our lives may reassure Their blossoms from their roots, accessible Alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewhr, Growing straight out of'man's reach, on the hill. God only, who made us rich, can make us poor. There are a good many different homes in this world -real homes, ideal homes, homes of convenience, homes of sentiment. Some people sleep at home, bat do not live there; some people find home a heaven, as it should be; and some-well, Mayhew's home was the ideal of those who dream of one, but do not possess it, and to enter it was to leave outside any doubts of the reality of a future state of bliss and joy. When we come to the gate of the city, we shall not doubt the reality of the city itself-and we stand at the gate now. But I started out to say something about the morning meal, which, with too many in this world, is but a blue beginning of a comfortless day; and I have often wondered why it is that people do not see how much of the happiness of life depends on our beginning each day aright. Little things make up the great story of life, as little figures make up the distance from the earth to the sun. Breakfast is but a little thing, apparently; yet it makes or mars the day, somewhat. If it is cold, unpalatable, cheerless, we go And     ICo     Romance of /te Table. to our daily labor petulant, dissatisfied, morose-or we are apt to do so-and a little wound is made which, increasing from day to day in size, may in time change the entire character. The philosophy which governs breakfast widely varies among civilized people; yet the greatest differ- ence is between those speaking the English tongue and all others. It is rare to find, outside of England and America, any people who make a hearty meal before eleven or twelve o'clock. We jump out of bed and hastily swallow rolls, coffee, buckwheat cakes, steak, fish, chops, eggs, mush, and as much more as the kitchen affords; and then, on a loaded stomach, set about our daily affairs without giving a moment's time for that rest which digestion would seem to need 'when suddenly brought to such a labor. The English- 'man lunches at twelve-a lunch which some would 'call a very substantial meal-and he dines at night. 'We dine, instead of lunching, and take tea at night-a tea which is very often about equal to the English- man's lunch. Foreigners, as we call them, take coffee and a small piece of bread early in the morning, and then wait patiently till noon or thereabouts for the breakfast proper. Sometimes the coffee is taken in bed, and sometimes, as in hot countries, it is served out-doors, under the trees. I confess to a liking for the system. It seems rational. The appetite is not apt to be active in the morning; and to force one's self to eat a hea:ty meal is to force Nature to rebel and resent the act. A little wholesome exercise is sure to clear both body and mind of torpid impurities, and bring us to the table with relishing appetites.   More about Breakfast.      I09 In Switzerland, the early breakfast consists of bread and honey. What lovers of honey the Swiss are! It is their substitute for Yankee molasses. Then, a walk in the mountains and a sail on the lake brings the traveler back to his inn with an appetite like a bear. Dyspepsia is a rare' complaint, outside of the United States and England; and I think much of it can be traced back to over-loaded stomachs early in the morning, and much to the pernicious habit of eating, at that particular time, the most indigestible food of the day: hot biscuits and hot griddle-cakes, with stews and fried meats, which are more difficult for the civilized stomach to master than for the Greenlander to digest his morning meal of blubber and train-oil. Cook books are filled with directions how to over-load the stomach, but none of them tell us how to treat it properly. Doctors are ready enough to cure us of our ailments, but how many are there who teach us how in avoid them? Here is where the forte lies of Dr. Sollinger, and here is where he differs from any living man I have known. He aims to restore men to Nature, and to start them off again in harmony. Preachers and professors talk a great deal about Nature, and. they talk wonderfully well, no doubt; but until I knew the Doctor, I never really knew anything practically of a subject on which I had heard so much learnedly. Dr Sollinger may not give his patients and students coffee and a roll for breakfast, for he is no friend to either; but he creates an appetite before he gives anything, and then he gives a breakfast which is nutritious and reasonable, and which the stomach can digest. His plan for restoring an appetite he will explain for himself, in the proper     I 1    Romance of the Table. place. Let the reader wait; and, after he has waited. he is not to look for witch-like incantations or miraculous workings, but for such simple common- sense as will surprise him. But, whether or no we adopt any particular theory in regard to breakfast, let us remember that plain and wholesome food, neatly prepared, is a great deal better to work on than the opposite; and, if we would have active bodies and clear minds, we should be wise enough and sensible enough to do those things which will secure us both. ,    CHAPTER XIX. THE BREAKFAST AT DR. SOLLINGER S. It is not the quantity of the meat, but the cheerfulness of the guests, which makes the feast.-Clarendon. It was the last evening of the season at Mayhew's -so it was understood. The rush of the business season was to commence soon, and it was thought best, even though there might be many more re- unions, that they should be of a less formal character, and partake more of friendly calls, than for the fur- therance of a definite end and investigation. Dr. Sol- linger was but a temporary resident in the city, and he was seeking a permanent location somewhere among the hills of Western New York, where he might be able to work out in practice the theories he had so earnestly expressed and so impressively enunciated. So had all the friends their aims, their duties, and their separate pathways to tread. The tendency of this world is to fly trom the center-like the wandering stars and meteors, which have no abiding place and no common center of attraction. The bachelor friend expressed his disgust of the changes of life. "Now," said he, "what is the use? Why cannot you all be as well satisfied as I am?" and he stretched his limbs out and yawned at a fearful rate. "If that is your way of enjoying yourself," said Florence, laughing, "I imagine the world, generally,     "2     Romance of the Table. will be better satisfied to travel on and leave you behind. There will not be much progress if we go to sleep in arm-chairs." "The sun has but one motion," retorted the bachelor, "and it never goes otit of its place in making that. I am satisfieL, to be the sun, and have you revolve around me." "But the sun shines, and you don't," said the Professor. "You don't give us either heat or motion. We should rather consider you an aerolite, pitched through space by some sudden convulsion of Nature from a remote quarter, and assuming here a state of complete rest." "I do not care," responded the bachelor; "rest is a very delightful thing. You have been bothering your wise brains over a great many problems. I have reaped the benefit without the labor; so go ahead. I rather think, though," continued the speaker, with sudden animation, "that, after so much talk about a breakfast, we should, at least, eat one before adjourn- ing for the season. Where is all your practice, I should like to know, after such abundant precepts?" "That is true," said Dr. Sollinger; " and, if you will permit me to offer you a breakfast, I will try what I can do in that line." "And you will show us how to boil a potato!" said the bachelor; "and how to eat it, no doubt?" "Yes," said the Doctor, "and how to eat it. You won't get broiled chicken nor juicy steak; but I will promise you that you shall not go away hungry." The proposition was carried, and it was further suggested that, if Mayhew could arrange for a morn- ing's absence from business, and would be good   Dr., Sollinger's Breakfast.   - 13 enough to wind up the season with any literary effort he chose to indulge in, there should be a full attend- ance, and the Doctor's breakfast should be discussed with all the honors. It-was on a delicious morning in the month of May. that the friends met in the little parlor of Dr. Sollin- ger's modest mansion; and, whether it was appetite or curiosity that had moved him, the bachelor was on hand as early as the rest. The Professor and Vohlen had brought their wives, and, with Thomas and Florence, there was as merry a party gathered around an eight o'clock breakfast as can ever be found anywhere. "Are we to go into the kitchen?" asked Vohlen. "And are we to help peel the potatoes?" demanded the bachelor. "I should rather think not," replied Dr. Sollinger, unless you wish the breakfast spoiled. You must never interfere with the domestic incantations of the cook, if you do not wish for Macheth's supper instead of a Christian's." The meal was not long delayed; but, to the chatting friends, it seemed as though there was a drama to be enacted, and that the dining-room door hid both scenery and actors. Florence so expressed herself, and as she did so, the tinkle of the breakfast bell was heard. Ix "A domestic drama? Yes," said the Doctor, "and the play is about to commence; only I fear that, when the actors are in all their places, there will be no audience. Walk in!" and he opened the doors. I do not know whether curiosity or surprise vas uppermost in the minds of the Doctor's visitors; 8     I F4    Romance of the Table. probably neither was very active. They all knew the Doctor's style of living, and there was only that little natural curiosity excited to see how he carried out his principles. The Doctor's means did not admit of any of those gorgeous displays of plate and china which malke a table magnificent, and so he had substituted flowers-just a few, for the season was early, but enough to give a fragrance to the room. The smell of meats and gravies, and of tea and coffee, were lacking. At each end of the table were smoking mountains of potatoes, boiled and beaten until they rivaled the snow in whiteness and consistency. Then, there were potatoes in their jackets, hot from the fire, and another dish prepared with cream, and also brought to a delicious brown exterior in the oven. Dry-toast and milk-toast; hominy and wheaten grits, both white and tender as perfect cooking could make them; apples, both baked and stewed, in slices, with enough sugar to give them a syrup-" very delicate and excellent," said the ladies; eggs, in the shell and poached; milk, fresh and pure as Long Island could produce; white bread and Graham bread, the like of which all declared they had never seen before, and butter sweet as the rose itself. "Your breakfast is before you," said Dr. Sollinger; "my humble larder yields nothing more." "And I very much fear it won't yield as much, soon," said Thomas, as the company fell to at their repast. The bachelor had insisted upon it, before sitting down, that he could finish his potato and breakfast in about five minutes; but, at the end of an hour, it is   Dr. Sollinger's Breakfast.    15 just to Dr. Sollinger to say that the company still lingered. There is enough, and yet no surfeit, they thought, rather than said. They ate and enjoyed, and experienced for once that almost unknown sensation among epicures of enjoying the last mouthful as much as the first. "Doctor," said the bachelor, holding out his glass for just one more taste of that milk, "you are a trump; and if any one says you don't know how to cook a potato, I'll knock his stupid head off with one." "Let me know, when we meet again," said the Doctor, "whether you need your dinner any sooner than usual to-day-although I can hardly expect you to feel the same on such a diet as those who are accustomed to it." It would be impossible for me to narrate all the questionings and cross-questionings of the ladies. lThat process of making bread! how were those potatoes cooked, and those apples brought to such a beautiful brown? Some could never cook hominy, and therefore never ate it; and wheaten grits turned out like pebbles in every kitchen. "That is the trouble," said the Doctor, winding up a long series of explanations. "People eat a great deal of meat because they can get nothing else. A West Indian negro will work like an ox, on yams and bananas, while we famish on the produce of our Northern farms and gardens. We tcan cook a steak, but we cannot boil a potato, fit to be eaten. Come, Mayhew, let us have that story." -      CHAPTER XX. M A Y HE W'S S T OR Y. THE THREE BREAiKFASTS. PART I.-THE LAST BREAKFAST IN THE VALLEY. The traveler first entering Switzerland, cannot but note a certain definite change in his feelings; a lifting from his mind of any weight which might have op- pressed it; anew-born buoyancy of thought to which he has probably been a stranger. The towering, snow- capped mountains seem to point to a better world-to a higher, purer, clearer state, both mental and physical, than he has ever before experienced. He may have talked of freedom all his life, but he now feels it; he can hardly believe it possible that he is in a world of strife and worrying cares, such as he has lived in so long. The fruitful valleys lie so peacefully under the shadows of the everlasting hills, and the peasantry seem so Arcadian in their desires, as well as in their occupations. Yet have the Swiss seen days as eventful, and struggles as great, as any people under the sun; and their present political life has been wrought out of those dire convulsions without which, seemingly, neither nations nor individuals can be perfected. At one time, rent by internal factions, Switzerland was in slavery to certain patricians, who claimed to rule by ij   The Yiree Breakfasts.     117 virtue of mere family traditions, and vlho parceled the country among each other with a sole eye to the various degrees of nobility which existed among themselves. So, too, has Switzerland suffered from religious persecution, and has been the foothall of that passion which at times sought to compass heaven as well as earth in its insane lust of power. Nursed, therefore, in the cradle of adversity, and hardened by exposure to the life of the mountains, the Swiss have ever been heroes in war-however great the extreme between the conflicts of the battle-field and the employments of the neatherd and the husbandman. There is no doubt in my mind that, however oppressed, the love of freedom was ever active within the Swiss, and that he gloried in his strength and courage as means toward a future emancipation, which might be denied him in the present. And it is wonderful how obedient and trustful the Swiss soldier became; what an unwaver- ing reliance he placed in his superior officer; how ready to die, when there was no escape except through dishonor. In these virtues the mountaineers rivaled the ancient Greeks; and the story I am to tell you will narrate as sublime an act of heroism as distin- guished those who fought and died at Thermopylae. Lucerne is considered the most beautiful of Swiss lakes. Entering Switzerland from France, it is the first one visited, and the traveler is more apt then to feel that exaltation of the spirit of which I have spoken-aided, too, by the fact that it has so many historic associations, and has been the scene of so many struggles for national and spiritual liberty. One of its most rugged mountains is named after the - XtJ     "8     Romance of the Table. judge who condemned our Lord, and a strange legend brings him to a suicide's grave, by a mad plunge from some jutting peak into the wild gulf below; and well can I testify to the terrible sublimity of that mountain top, and to the swimming brain that seeks to penetrate through mist and shadow to the rocky chasm five thousand feet below! But, if the mountains are terrific in their grandeur, the valleys that lie between, and seem to cling to them as to protecting genii, fairly over-run with that quiet peace which steals into the soul and makes it human. The infant is more an infant when in its mother's or its father's arms, and the valley is more charming than the plain, and more filled with the genius of peace and love, by its proximity with the mountain. It was in the valley of Engleberg, in the year 1788, that three Swiss brothers agreed to make a part of a regiment which was then being raised for service in France; for the patience and bravery of the hardy Swiss soldiers had been tested so often as to make kings anxious to be served by such guards, who were far more likely to be faithful in an emergency than their own subjects. But the brothers, Albert, Wilhelm and Arnold, brave as they were, did not dream of war in connection with their new service. They were told that they were to guard King Louis, the head of the great French nation; that they were to surround him on all occasions of state, and to shine, in their red coats, as the particular and most trusted soldiers of the monarch. Hard work had the brothers at home; driving the cattle to the mountains in summer; cultivating their little gardens, and garnering but a trifle each year wherewithal they might buy trinkets   The Three Breakfasts.     119 for their bright-eyed sweethearts, or furnish the cottages to which they hoped to bring their brides at no distant day. It is a fine thing to be a soldier in times of peace, thought Albert, Wilhelm and Arnold- to serve a great king, and to come home with money in our pockets! Five years seem a long, long while; but they will pass, and then we can return and marry, and tell fine stories of Paris and our travels to our neighbors and their children. Yet it is not so easy to pass from the dear valley of Engleberg as thbr thought when they enlisted. In those secluded lamlets, where all form one family; where every bi th, and death, and marriage, is known by all, anl where all rejoice or suffer from the same cause, the coming departure of the three brothers created such a genuine sensation that they found themselves heroes without fighting a battle, and greater men than the pastor' of the town of Engleberg itself, or the still greater man who'to his trade of cheese-maker united that of justice of the peace-though it is proper to say that for many years no offenders had been brought before him. Then, too, there were a great deal taller mountains to get over, before reaching Paris, than the Rigi or Pilatus; and a far greater chill to fall upon the mind than falls upon the hills in the depth of winter. AlbertWilhelm and Arnold had each been betrothed for more than a year; yet, foolish boys as they were, they had never known what a tremendous power is hidden in a woman's reproachful face; how a woman's tears, when they flow direct from the heart, are worse to meet and overcome than a regiment in steel. Simple-minded youth! You thought that Gretschen,     120    Romance of the Table. Maria and Jean would rejoice like yourselves, and wave their bright ribbons as your red coats appeared in glorious array, and you marched gallantly in the ranks of your regiment. Oh, Albert, Wilhelm and Arnold! did you not reflect that five years to a loving heart is an eternity? Did you not think that what a man calls glory a woman calls death? What cared they for the foolish French king who powdered his hair; who dressed in purple velvet, and who spent his time between making locks and eating? So, as the time approached for their departure, Albert, Wilhelm, and Arnold, instead of being very much elated, were very much depressed. And they were not encouraged, either, by the sad looks of the peasantry generally. It was very- much there as elsewhere. Old men who had served their time in the army, and especially those who had seen service, shook their heads ominously, and had wonderfully fresh memories in regard to all they had gone through themselves; and as they had no idea of a soldier's life apart from active war, and as they attrib- uted their preservation from sudden death to mira- cles, so they came to think that the chances were very poor for any one else. When they shook hands with the brothers, as they did on an average about three times each day, they shook their heads sorrowfully; the tears came into their eyes as they were bid- ding them farewell for the last time, and they had already in their, old brains a prospective view of a field of battle, and the three brothers lying side by side in the grim embrace of death. But the time was hastening apace when Albert, Wilhelm and Arnold must bid farewell to Engleberg.   The Three Breakfasts.     121 However heavy might be their hearts, there was no retreat; nay, no one even thought of such a thing in the whole valley; for, after all, Swiss courage and Swiss honor were as dear to the humblest peasant as to the highest prince, and, if their hearts had turned to lead, they would never have hinted at such a thing as desertion of their colors to the three brave boys who stood on the mountain side, in all the beauty of strength and manliness, on the last summer morning before they joined their regiment in the town of Lucerne, and took their last farewell of the beautiful lake which is the jewel of Switzerland. It had been arranged by all the neighbors of the young men to give them a farewell breakfast ere, they turned their backs upon their native mountains; and it was so warm and bright a morning that the table was spread under the trees, where the cool winds of the mountains could be felt, and where the music was furnished by a leaping waterfall, which never ran more swiftly nor sang more blithely than on this occasion. - If it seemed to say farewell! farewell! or if its cadence was of that kind which brings sadness rather than mirth, it was not the fault of the water, but of the hearts which sp twisted and turned its song into unison with their own sadness and sorrow. The good wives of the valley had done their part well at this breakfast. The boys should have some- thing to remember, at all events, and should go away with something besides soldiers' fare in their knap- sacks, after they had eaten their fill. The simple breakfast of the Swiss peasantry, of black bread and milk, of curds and whey, of cheese and honey-and not all at once either, by any means-was changed into as *   .        122    Romance of the Table. luscious a repast as any healthy appetite need crave. There was all I have named; and, besides, such tender cuts from the mountain goat; such white bread and butter; such fragrant stews and nicely browned omelettes; such crisp salads and mellow fruits; such sweetmeats and dainties, as many old men, familiar all their lives with mountain fare, had never heard of before. After the breakfast was over, the health of the brothers was proposed, and the honest old burgo- master made a little speech, and broke down before he was half through; and then the tears with which his voice was choked seemed to start the fountain in everybody's eyes, and people fell upon each other's necks and wept. Then came the calm, and friends began to talk cheerfully again (how the human heart vibrates between fear and joy). "And, after all," said one, "why should we wash our boys away in a river of tears? Five years are nothing, especially when we look back upon them, and they will return with their savings and will marry, and then we shall rejoice as now we weep. Let them go, with our blessing; and now let us sing the song of freedom once again." So the Ranz des Vache was sung, and echoed among the mountains; and old soldiers, seized with the martial enthusiasm of their youth, clanked their glasses together and roared in chorus, and even the star-like eyes of the affianced shone without tears as they thought of their lovers in their red coats, trusted by the king and admired by the people.   The Th7ree Breakfasts.     123 You will be loving and true to king and to us!" said they, as, in last embrace, they were inclosed in their lovers' arms. "We are Sw' s, and cannot be otherwise," said the young men. So they exchanged little bits of silver as love tokens, and as charms against disease and death; and, as Albert, Wilhelm and Arnold, putting on their red coats, turned to view the mountain of Pilatus for the last time ere they marched forth with their comrades, there were bright ribbons waving, as they had first dreamed; and the eyes of the maidens, though some- what dim, were still bright enough to cheer the young soldiers on many a weary round of duty, and on many a lagging day, which seemed the longer the more impatiently they wished it to close. Five years! how short as we look back; how long as we listen to the heavy striking of the bell in the old watch-tower! PART II.-THE LAST BREAKFAST IN THE TUILLERIES. Que dirai-je? Que ferai-ie? Pauvre miserable roi  Ah! personne. La couronne - 'embarrasse autaut que moi. Four years had passed away since the Swiss brothers enlisted in the French King's service. The murmurs of a coming revolution had not reached them in the happy valley of Engleberg, and they had dreamed only of the luxury of a court, which they  were in some degree to share, and of a kingly power     124    Romance of the Table. which they were to sustain. Placed under the immediate eye of royalty, they had striven to develop those soldierly accomplishments which should most commend them to the notice of the monarch, and entitle them, at the end of their service, to such a reward as they fondly imagined a king would bestow. If now they heard the mutterings of a coming storm; if they felt that oppressiveness in the atmosphere which heralds a political whirlwind, they, simple- minded children of the Alps, hardly thought of it except wonderingly, and believed that King Louis could quench the flames with a wave of his hand, or quiet the popular clamor with a nod of his royal head. Unfortunate indeed was it for King Louis that his people found out that he was less a king than a man; that, as Lamartine expresses it, he was "but the father of a family." "There is a divinity doth hedge a king," says Shakespeare; and it was a severe check to royalty in France when the people discovered that Louis, instead of being a divinity, was one of the weakest of mortal men. -The chief of a nation should have courage-and not mere animal courage, either, for Louis had that; but a courage which can seize upon circumstances and control them-a courage which can rise superior to events, and enable its possessor to mould public opinion to his will; and that courage, and confidence in himself, Louis XVI. had not. Alarmed and dis- couraged, he attempted to escape from his throne and his people. Arrested at Varennes and brought back to Paris, it was again proven that kings have mortal weaknesses, and he was despised therefor. Just in proportion as he sank in popular esteem, so far the   The Three Breakfasts.      125 people discovered their own power and vaunted themselves on their own abilities; and, like wild beasts freed from the trammels of the cage, they exercised them. No timid, vascillating leaders were wanted then. The sweep of the blast that levels forests cannot be stayed by structures of lath; and such a structure had the French monarchy become in the year 179I. For the moment, there were men of might who had the iptellectual power to control events. So, when the king was brought back after his disgraceful flight, an edict was passed which read thus: "Quiconque applaudira le roi sera batt' ; qziconqtme i'znsultera sera pendi." (Whoever applauds the king will be beaten; whoever insults him will be hung.) And the people obeyed. There were neither shouts nor insults; the king was received in utter silence; heads were not uncovered-why should they be?  Enshrined in a palace, Louis was a king; before the people, and a prisoner, he was but a man. As a step toward Republicanism, the Assembly deprived him of his titles of Sire and Majesty, and it was also ordained that, if the king visited the National Legislature, the members might sit in his presence-an indignity which even Louis resented with tears. Long had the storm been gathering which was at last to culminate in such a sea of blood and wretched- ness as the world had rarely witnessed. It is hard to sift from history the real causes of the French Revolu- tion. You will find it here, says one author; you will find it there, says another: it was the disorder of the finances; it was the stagnation of trade; it was the poverty and want of employment of the people; it     I25    Romance of the ZTabl. was the veto power of the king. It is as vain to seek for causes of political and social revolutions as it is for the caverns of the winds or the store-houses of the lightning. There are periods when the internal forces of Nature produce earthquakes; so there are internal moral forces which produce wars and commotions. If one of those grim and blackened savages, who would have murdered Marie Antoinette in cold blood, had been asked in what way he had been oppressed by the government of the king, he could not have replied. To yell and scream himself hoarse; to denounce royalty and cry out egalite, was the diameter and circumference of his political education; and he represented his brothers, all of whom shouted the same cries, and panted, tiger-like, for the same blood. T do not say that France had no grievances; but she had none which could not have been redressed far more easily than by an indiscriminate and merciless warfare against the best blood of the nation. The road which France took toward the Temple of Liberty, led, in reality, toward a more cruel despotism than that from which she endeavored to escape. First, the despotism of the multitude; second, the despotism of a Napoleon, compared with which the government of Louis XVI. was mild and paternal. And how many golden opportunities you lost to restore peace to the country and the throne to your- self-poor, weak Louis! King of a nation, passing the precious hours in making locks! Locks which were at last turned upon you, O king in violet vest- ments, and which locked-you out forever! Why, it is asserted by more than one author that, even at the very /ast, had the king mounted his horse and,    The Three Breakfasts.     127 placing himself at the head of his guard, had charged upon the revolutionists, the whole insurrection would have vanished. Lafayette dispersed a crowd of armed and ferocious men by discharging a volley over their heads. Once, too, in the very crisis of his fate, when the king appeared upon the balcony, the grenadiers, carried away with a little of ancient reverence and loyalty, gave vent to the old shout, Vive le roi! placing their caps upon their bayonets and sabres and waving them in the air. Where were you then, O Louis? and why did you not show yourself a king? Louis was not a bad king at heart; nay, he was one of the kindest and most loving of men. His life, says rhiers, was a martyrdom. He had good desires, but not the force of character necessary to carry them out. In his most trying moments, too, he was serene and courageous. He seemed to think that somewhere in the popular heart were love and mercy to be found, and that as lie loved the people, so would they finally turn and love him. He thought little of personal danger, but much of his family. And so, little by little, the kingly power waned, and littlp by little the single head of the nation was replaced by a hydra. Men who sought to stem the tide were carried away with it, and men who-like Robespierre, surnamed The Just-would have tem- pered justice with mercy, were swept onward to the commission of crimes which made the world stand aghast with horror. They dethroned a king; they slaughtered the nobility, and perished themselves. So it was that France marched to freedom. It was a sad, sad morning in the month of August, in the year 1792, that Louis XVI. and his family were ,         128    Romance of the Table. aroused at an early hour by the cries and songs of an infuriated multitude at the gates of the palace. Far as the eye could reach were visible such a motley throng as civilization does not often present to the gaze of man.  Men with knives between their clenched teeth; -men with the rusty flint-locks of the 17th and ISth centuries; with bars of iron and antique swords; with heavy pistols and reaping- hooks; with clubs and stones-with every conceiv- able weapon which revenge and despotism can seizes  upon.  Women, too, were there, with disheveled locks and fiery eyes. The night had been sleepless to all that surging crowd, and there were many tokens that the red wine had been called upon to, stimulate the desire for destruction and for blood. And what was this all for, this great uprising of the people? In that palace was but one family-a weak- minded but good-hearted king; a princess famed for her beauty and sensibility, and two children-that is all, not counting the servants and guards always to be found in kingly households. And yet, surging against the palace walls was a sea of beings in human form, and rising upon the clear air of a summer morning came the infuriate shouts and the ribald songs of a people, not one hair of whose heads would that king have willingly harmed. One would have thought that a hundred Caligulas were inclosed in that palace,'and that the spirits of all they had slain had come back again to repay their deeds a thousand- fold. Yet, with this gathering tempest around him, King Louis took his morning cup \of coffee and ate his white roll. There was no sign of fear upon the   The Three Breakfasts.     129  king's face, and even the queen's agony did not disturb his placidity. The prince royal gazed upon the shouting crowd below and listened with a curious smile of wonder upon his child-face. Then, going to his father's knee, the king gave his son a little of the coffee from his own cup and broke a morsel from his own roll of bread. Thus breakfasted the king of the French people for the last time in his own Palace of the Tuilleries, and, having finished, he took his boy upon his knee and calmly waited for the next leaf in his history to be turned. PART III.-THE LAST BREAKFAST ON EARTH. Even in the hour of supreme peril, the soldier eats his rations. He knows full well that only in his strength of body can he find that strength of mind necessary to face danger, and he boils his coffee and cooks his meat, if he has any, upon the very ground which in an hour may be a battle-field and his own grave. So the Swiss guard drank their coffee on that fatal tenth of August, The coffee and the bread were blacker than the king had partaken of; but they swallowed the food as calmly as he, and then waited as patiently for that leaf in history in which they were to figure through all the coming time.. The Swiss were men-human men. They had fathers and mothers in the mountains, and sweet- hearts, too; and a few had wives and little ones awaiting their return. They thought of the mount- ains then, I warrant; of the chamois they had hunted 9'     130    Romance of the Table. from crag to crag, and of the herds they had driven to the hills in search of pasture; and then, as they listened to the hoarse roar of the hungry and terrible crowds around the palace, I wonder if they wandered still more, in thought, to the valleys and among the homes of their dearly loved Switzerland? Be that as it may, the Swiss, as soldiers, knew only one word-obey; and, oh! how they longed for a captain to lead them. The king was their head; and had the king come down the royal staircase then, and called upon the servants to throw open the great gates, and had he marched at the head of that noble body of men-true as steel to him, even the more when deserted by his own people-the leaf of history might have been differently penned, and the throne might have been again filled by a king, and not divided between a- Danton, a Marat, and a Robespierre. But Louis did nothing of the sort. Instead thereof, he threw himself upon the protection of the Assembly, and the guard, seeing themselves thus deserted, were disheartened and dismayed. What! the king leave them to the fury of a mob! They, a few hundred men-their red coats the mark for every bullet-to be left to shift for themselves as best they might! It was even so. Turning his back upon the unhappy Swiss, and upon the home he should have defended, Louis marched, with a small retinue, to the halls of the National Legislature, the little prince, still unconscious of his changed fortunes, gamboling in playful humor as he walked, and kicking the leaves he found upon his path. What were the poor Swiss to, do? They knew of but one duty, says the historian-that of standing by   The Three Breakfasts.     I 3 their post, fast and immovable, "red granite in a flashing sea of steel." Even the sentries walk steadily in their beats. The crowds, cowardly at first, as all crowds are, look with awe and respect upon that brave soldier, as he marches with slow and measured tread; shrinking from him as he approaches, and advancing again as he disappears in the shadow of an arch. Think, if the presence of one armed man had this effect upon a multitude, what would have been the result if a thousand had been suddenly thrown upon the foe, with the sound of trumpet and the flashing of steel! Their only orders, however, were to stand firm; not to be the aggressors, but to repel force with force. And so the crowd of insurgents, and yet-to-be assas- sins, stood looking on; then, grown more bold, unresisted as they were, they advanced a little; then one more daring than all the rest, armed with a stout pole, with a hook at the end thereof, made a sudden plunge at the sentinel as he emerged from the arch- way, and seizing him with the hook, drew him forward into the crowd and kept him there a prison- er. Another was put in his place, and, elated with their success, he, too, was seized; another and another followed, with the like result. Then succeeded a more daring movement, and then that element of the wild beast in man broke loose, when he needs but the smell of blood to make him a tiger. Rushing through the great gates of the palace, there was a roll of musketry-just those few chance'shots which might be heard without alarm in the midst of a city-but this was merely the signal for the combat. On one side, seven hundred Swiv--dis-     I32    Romance of the Table. ciplined, it is true, and faithful to their trust-on the other a multitude no man could numhber; many with the uniform of the French soldier, but the multitude in the blouse and sabots of the working-man and peasant. *The fight against the Swiss was less a combat than a massacre. The sentinels who had been captured had their brains beaten out upon the stone pavement, and there was a thirst for blood, rather than for victory. "Kill! kill!" was the cry. Faithfulness such as the Swiss Guard showed on that day should have been honored; but the people looked upon the soldiers as the instruments of despotism, and in their unreasoning rage, thought of nothing but slaughter. Of course, the Swiss defended themselves, as soldiers must when danger is to be faced. Four hundred, it is said, fell at the hands of eighty; but what is four hundred when twice as. many thousand stand ready to fill their places? But where are the brothers while this work is going on? There they are, shoulder to shoulder, on the grand staircase-pale, too, but not with fear. Con- stant vigils wear out even a soldier's frame, and our boys from the valley of Engleberg were mortal, with the rest of us. As the fight went on, there were many deeds of daring and gallantry. Scarce a half-score of Swiss made a desperate sortie, and seized some cannon, but had nothing wherewith to discharge them. Some engaged in a hand-to-hand conflict with their assail- ants, and, killing many, were themselves slain, still facing the foe and falling in their own footsteps. Swifter than thought, the guard upon the staircase would hurl themselves upon the people below, and   The Three Breakfasts.      133 then fall back again, stepping over the bodies of their own comrades fallen upon the lower steps. Then, firing as best they might, each rank died in turn, and every step of the palace was carpeted with the warm bodies of dying men. Away, away, to the top of the staircase they lay, and the last shot was fired there- from only when the last man had passed beyond the realm of war to the realms of everlasting peace! Midway lay the bodies of Albert, Wilhelm and Arnold. When the turn in the tide had come; when there were none left to kill; when those who escaped from the palace had been hunted from house to house and tree to tree, and had been killed, as men can kill each other,! without mercy, then rough hands brought the brothers out and laid them upon the grass of the garden. No one would have known the boys who quitted the Engleberg valley four years before. They were thin with loss of rest, and their faces were grimy with powder. The blood from their wounds had matted their hair, and stained their clothes. Yet through all could a stranger have seen that love was uppermost in their minds as they fell; that the angel of mercy, summoned to bear their souls to the gardens of Para- dise, had left on each face the imprint of that affection which death cannot destroy. Desolate valley! There were sounds of woe and of passionate weeping when the tidings were brought that your sons had been slain as dogs are slain-as cattle are brought low in the shambles. Old men and stooping  housewives mourned and  refused to be comforted; and the young gathered together under 'the old trees where the last breakfast was eaten, and     134    Romance of the Table. talked in whispers of the comrades and lovers who had fought for a weak king and gained naught but the crown of martyrdom for themselves. Time assuages many griefs, but time never blots out the deeds of the truly great; and as time fled, the traditions of the valley but multiplied, and the history of the three brothers grew warmer and dearer. Many a valley in Switzerland besides, Engleberg mourned over other children, and many a maiden wept for lover lost on that bloody day. So, in time came a great artist, a worker in stone, and the side of a rock was selected for a monument. A strange device it was: a lion wounded unto the death, but still bearing his head proudly up, and his eyes still flashing the fire of defiance. Thus are the deeds of the Swiss heroes carved in stone, and so long as that rock stands in the fair city of Lucerne, will the martyred Swiss be remembered, and their heroic deeds and faithfulness be handed down to the generations yet to come 1    PART II.     s   CHAPTER 1.

Morning, Noon, Night! Youth, Manhood, Age! The day is an epitome of a century, and, as in the smallest specimen of vitality the microscope reveals we have the essentials of the largest, so is each day the shadow of the longest life. Let any man look back upon half a century of contention with the world, and how short it seems! As, after years of travel, the voyager carries in his brain the pyramids, towers and  obelisks, so is it with  life; we remember the great events, the trying   crisis, the marriage, the births or deaths of our loved ones, while the thoughts, fancies, hopes, events, which really made up each day as it swept us onward, are buried, without a chance to live again. The morning never comes without there is a noon to follow, and the noon ushers in the declining day and its sure adjunct, sleep, and sleep is but the emblem of death. The former is welcomed as the greatest of blessings, but the latter-well, that is a blessing, too, though we dc not think so.     138     Romance of the Table. The summer following the last breakfast was one of the most eventful in the lives of our hero and heroine; yet, as I have started out to write the romance of the table, I hesitate how far to indulge my readers with any history outside thereof. Thomas Mayhew found, as most young men will, that there is no royal road to success, no ever-blossoming field of unalloyed peace and prosperity. But Mayhew united uncommon firmness of character with such prudence and discretion, that, under any circumstances, he never lost his presence of mind. One of those periodical pressures occurred that summer which so often test the very strongest business houses; and the firm with which Mayhew was connected, and in which he soon hoped to be a partner, found themselves in a position of great embarrassment. To take up one side of a bill-book, as it is called in commercial parlance, is sufficient to satisfy most people; but to take up both sides, to pay their own debts and other peoples' as well, was rather more than they had contemplated. Added, to bad collections, and the utter failure of many of their customers, was the well-known result of bad times- the inability of the banks to extend the usual facilities to their depositors. The rule seems to be, when you don't want money there is plenty of it to lend; when you do want it there is none to be had. It was so new a thing for Thomas to come home with a clouded brow, that Florence was at first alarmed; but, wifen the story of financial trouble was told hel whe- T :om Is explained the entire situation, she at once de .onstrated that a weak woman can, when she \ ils it, be-a strong one, and that there is   Tig-ht Times.       139 enough pent-up sunlight in some women's hearts to illuminate the universe. Of course, she could not pay the debts of the firm, but she could add to the courage of her husband, and she could suggest some possible expedients which might not present th2m- selves to the fevered brain of a man. Just to please Florence, for instance, Thomas brought home the balance-sheet from his books, showing the position of affairs, and many a consulta- tion was held in the dining-room. The pleasant ifiterchange of thought of the past winter was replaced by the sternest of all questions-that on which depends the credit of the husband, and the ways and the means of living of both husband and wife. Of course, it may be readily supposed that there could not be the same quiet satisfaction at the table, nor the same amount of pleasure, as at other times. The piano was less open now, and the work-basket was frequently appealed to to help pass a vacant hour. Yet Florence never failed to receive her husband with a sobered, but hopeful, countepance; with those words and smiles of cheer which go so far toward relieving an aching heart. It is true Mayhew was not personally involved. The firm might suspend, yet he would in no way be compromised. He might lose his situation, yet his abilities and character would obtain him another; but he felt, as all young men should feel, that the credit of the firm with which he was so identified was his own, and that it was his duty to act just as though he was really a partner, with all his fortune involved. "I may be so situated," he argued, "some day, and it 4s well for m to do now as I should be forced to do thea.'     "O     Romance of the Table. "You have a very large amount falling due next week," said Florence to her husband, after dinner one sultry day in the latter part of August. "Yes; very large. Our September payments mainly come due at that time, and how we shall manage I do not know. I never knew such a time for collections." "Could you do any better if you went on a collect- ing trip yourself?" "Possibly, but I had not thought of that, and I do not like to leave you and home. Besides, I can do nothing in season to meet our September payments in that way." "Well, you are quite confident, are you not, that with time there will be no difficulty; that you have assets enough to cover all your liabilities?" "Yes, beyond any reasonable doubt. If the traders in the country find it convenient to pay, they do so; if not, not; but most of them, if not all, will be good, eventually. They do not reflect that atoms aggre- gated make a large bulk. Each one only thinks that he owes but a trifle, a few hundred dollars, perhaps, and that so small an amount cannot possibly affect us." "Then, how do you stand with those you owe?" "Our position has been excellent, and is now, I may say; but you know how, in times like these, a breath of suspicion will often ruin the best firms in the city. People are governed so much by impulse. See how our banks, in specie times, were forced to suspend, merely by the unreasoning act of the multitude! In panic times it is almost impossible to reason with people."   Tight Times.        141 Florence was thoughtful for some time, and then she said: "Tom, dear, there is no help for it; you must go to your creditors and tell them frankly how you are situated. I have faith in you"-and Flor- ence's eyes grew lustrous-"I have faith in you, and I believe you can accomplish what neither of the firm could. You have established a character, and now is the time to see what character will do for you. Go to each man quietly; offer him all you think you can, in justice to the rest; show him your statement, and ask him for an extension of thirty or sixty days. If you arrange matters, as I think you will, then start for the country at once. I can do without you, and you will be all the dearer when you come back." Tom looked at his wife with surprise and delight. He might have had doubts as to the feasibility of her plan, but he resolved, at least, to lay it before the partners. He found them in a mood for anything which promised to tide over the difficulties, and they gave him permission to try it. Tom sallied forth on his mission with something like lead in one corner of his heart; but it melted somewhat as he thought of those bright eyes at home, and of the expectant look at dinner-time. His experiences it would be tedious to relate; but he was more successful than he had really expected to be. Here and there were men who were as "short" as Mayhew himself, and could not renew paper without ruin to themselves, and occasionally he came across those quick, snappish business-men who belong to the bull-dog breed of humanity, and lose no oppor- tunity of showing how little sympathy they have for any but themselves.     I42     Romance of the Table. "Pay or break, just as you please," said one of this class; "you can't break me, and if you can't pay, stop, and have done with it." "Pooh," said another; "you will worry through it. We can't renew your paper, and your assets look good enough." "Try all the rest, and then come back," said a third. "Renew for you, Tom?" said another; "yes, of course. Don't show your papers, Tom I know what you say is good enough without a reference." Next, Mayhew went to one of the very largest of their creditors-a man noted for his shrewdness, as well as for his wealth, and the man of alf the rest of whom Thomas had the least hopes. Mayhew stated his business in as few words as possible, and offered to show his statements. The creditor looked at them carefully, and then looked Thomas straight in the face. "Mayhew," said he, "do you believe that you can get through with the accommodation you seek?" "I am quite sure of it," replied Tom, "or - would not have applied." "I am in want of just such a man as you." said Mr. Williams; " can I offer you any inducement to change your place?" "None whatever," replied Tom, frankly. "I would not leave my position while the firm is in any difficul. ties, at any rate." "What time did you say you wanted?" "Sixty days, if it suits you," said Mayhew. "Take ninety," replied Mr Williams, "and, Mayhew, if you get in a very tight corner, and want a thousand or two, come back again."   T7ight 7Timzes.       I43 All the lead melted now, and the tears came to Tom's eyes. "God bless you, Mr. Williams," he said; "not only for your financial succor, but for Ahat is a thousand times better, for that kindness which gives a man courage and strength." "Nonsense, man," said the good merchant, with a smile. "Those who expect to live and love in Heaven had better try to live and love on earth, to see how they will like it up above. Heaven may not suit us otherwise, however much we may talk about it here." "You, at least, illustrate the fact," said Thomas, "that man can practice as well as preach; and I shall value the present pinch in our affairs as teaching me how to do it myself. I see more clearly than ever before the necessity for a man to form acharacter on earth which shall bring him into a state receptive of Heavenly joys; and I thank you most sincerely for the lesson." "I think I saw the names of two or three friends of mine on your list," said. Mr. Williams; "will you allow me to look at it again?" Thomas handed the paper to his friencT;who rapidly ran his eye over it, and returned it, saying, "Yes, I thought so; there are some, I think, I can help you to manage better than you can do alone. Let me go with you." Mayhew was astonished-too much so to speak, and he mechanically put on his hat and followed Mr. Williams to the street. In an hour they had visited three merchants, and the business was managed in such a quiet way, and Mayhew's benefactor had put matters in such a favorable light, that the extension     "4    Romance of the Table. had not only been arranged, but they all agreed to sell the firm any goods that might be wanted, thus demonstrating their faith in their honesty and solvency. "I have heard of you outside of business," said Mr. Williams, as they parted, "and of the pleasant even- ings at your house last winter. Dr. Lorton is my physician, as well as yours, and he informed me of your sensible way of living. Now, my family are out of town, but, if you and your wife will come round and take dinner with me to-morrow, I shall be glad to see you. I should like to hear something of your views on many subjects, and you can invite me, if you think proper, next winter, when your home-club reassembles. Good-bye. To-morrow at harf-past five; you know where to find me."   CHAPTER II. THE SKY BRIGHTENS. The life of man is like playing with dice. If what you wish to throw does not turn up, that which comes by chance must be coro rected by skill.-Terence. The profound effect of a good example was hardly ever better illustrated than in that set by Mr. Williams. "Oh, yes, Tom," said many of those he next applied to, "got old William's name, have you, Tom? Well we can't do otherwise than follow suit- hand us the pen! Who knows but that we may want a favor some day? Times are tight; that's the fact, and, as nobody is to blame, we must stick to one another." Even some who were so hard up they had thought they could do nothing promised to make an effort to help a little, and Tom went home that night with a lighter heart than he had had for months; yet, when his wife, who had been watching for him, saw him coming and opened the door, he clasped her in his arms and burst into a flood of very unmanly tears. Florence was not alarmed; there was a mysterious instinct which told her that the tears were tears of joy and not of sorrow, and if her own eyes were dimmed/there was no weight on her heart as an excuse. Neither with the reaction came there any outhurst of exuberant joy, but seated in the quietest corner of the parlor they remained hand in hand for some moments without speaking. There are some feelings which tongue ean, hardly express; others which will come low and soft to the lips, the words 10     "6     Romance of the Table. forming themselves into musical utterances, each having a volume of meaning. Such must be the tongue in which angels converse with each other; and it was thus the husband and wife, more lovers now than ever, spoke to each other on that evening. It was a happy and a hopeful story Tom had to relate, yet tempered with that slight melancholy which follows the first real bitter experiences of life; those terrible strains upon the mind and body which drive some men mad, and cast a shade of sadness over the stoutest. The trouble was not all over, either; Thomas had now to go to work to redeem the confi- dence of his friends, and this could only be done by the most persevering efforts. He must leave his darling Florence and his happy home, at least for a season, and he must mix with men he knew little about, and plead for his honor, which was far dearer to him than life. But here came in again the loving yet firm words of FlorenCe. She was fully equal to the emergency, now, for the success of Tom so far gave her courage, and the excitement attendant upon such novel thoughts and duties kept down all the rebellious movements of her yearning affections. "Go, Torn? why of course you must go! and not a day to lose," exclaimed the brave little woman; "and your valise shall be packed to-morrow. But now that we are beginning to feel comfortable again, pray do tell me what makes times tight? You see that, after all, I am only an ignorant little goose, and know nothing whatever. Why should there be a scarcity of money one day and a superfluity the. next?" , .. 2   The Sky BrzgAehens.     147 "Well," said Tom, "you are asking questions which have puzzled Secretaries of the Treasury, and the whole world of financiers. Some attribute tight times to one cause, some to another. Some think they are owing to a high tariff, some to a low one; others think we have too much currency, others that we have not enough; my own impression is that people live beyond their means. If all men were saving and prudent there would be fewer goods sold, but fewer failures. The system of credits encourages speculation and extravagance, and people buy that on trust which they do not need, and which, when pay-day comes, they have not the wherewithal to meet. If the crops are light, or bring low prices, the farmer cannot pay the store-keeper; the latter is behind with his merchant, and the merchant is unable to meet his engagements. Credit is a very excellent thing, no doubt, in stimulating enterprise; but it is a two-edged sword, and is apt to smite both friends and foes." "It is very trying," said Florence, "'these ups and downs; but I suppose there is a necessity for us to be checked at times, or we should go beyond all bounds in our ventures and in our extravagancies." "Yes; only it happens that we are all so bound up together that the most prudent suffer- as well as the reckless. The failure of one house of supposed great strength will carry down a dozen more whose credit is bound up with that one.  Our position, for instance, is not due to any want of caution or foresight, but to the fact that a universal state of doubt and uncertainty has caused an entire interrup. tion in the current of trade and finance.'"     "8     Romance of the Table. "It is ab ut as well," said Florence, "that we should have our experiences. Let us try to take them all cheerfully, and even thankfully. No char- acter can be perfect which knows nothing of the misfortunes, as well as the successes, in life. But you were exceedingly fortunate in meeting with Mr. Williams; and we are to dine with him to-morrow?" "Yes." "How odd to ask us to dinner, and his family away!" "He has a maiden sister, who keeps house for him, so you will not be entirely lost." "Still I shall feel a little out of my element; but he has been so kind, I must do my best to please him." All the matters for Tom's departure were then discussed, and the arrangements made for home matters, as well. The younger sisters of Florence were to be invited to stay with her, and her father and mother would call daily to see that she was properly cared for. So the sky looked brighter the more they talked over matters, and the well of sympathy swelled into a river before that mighty power of affection. Mayhew  realized, if ever man can, the thought expressed by Tennyson, in "Maud:" '"I have led her home, my love, my only friend. There is none like her-none, And never yet so warmly ran my blood, And sweetly, on and on, Calming itself to the long wished for end; Full to the banks; close on the promised goodl.   CHAPTER     III. MAYHEW GOES SOUTH, AND HAS AN EXPERIENCE. Hope rules a land forever green; All powers that serve the bright-eyed Queen Are confident and gay; Clouds at her bidding disappear; Points she to aught? the blss draws near, And fancy smooths the way. Young married people who are forced by circum- stances to part for any length of time will know exactly what I might say in regard to the parting of Thomas and Florence; whether any others would appreciate[ a description, I much doubt. But, in fact, there was no scene at all. My young couple were very practical people, to begin with,- as the reader has ere this discovered, and they had seen enough of the serious side of life to make them still more so. They had realized the fact which I am writing this book to inculcate: that the author who imagines all sorts of romantic events, possible and impossible, as prelimi- nary to the happiness of marriage, has very properly finished up the romance, but has left his readers only at the threshold of reality. A life without realities does not amount to much. The man who is born with, and who keeps, a silver spoon in his mouth knows very little of life; far less of it than the father who achieved the fortune which the son inherits. The true character is created by experiences. To enjoy we must suffer. He is a hero only who has overcome reverses and sustained himself against odds.     150    Romance of the Table. So Mayhew's modest valise was packed, and so many little comforts put in, that, as he smilingly remarked, it needed but Florence in one corner to have home with him entire. "You will have me with you, dear, always and everywhere," said Florence; "and you must never think of me as absent. If such a feeling does come into your mind at any time, just look at this 'counterfeit presentment,' and sit down at once and write to the original;" and Florence pressed in his hand a little gem of a photograph, which had been taken that very morning. "The philosophy and the advice are good," said Thomas in reply. "I shall try to be guided by both, and you shall hear from me daily, even if my imagination is strong enough to keep you visibly before me." Let not my reader think that a moral hero has the power to overcome the natural feelings of his heart, and to deny himself the luxury of a few tears and anxious throbbings. The luxury of tenderness belonged to Mayhew and his wife in a high degree. They had all the sensitiveness of cultivated and refined natures, only they believed that every feeling of the soul should be made subservient to reason. If a duty was to be discharged they did not believe in repining over it for a week, and then coming to its performance reluctantly and with heavy hearts. They were not professedly religious people, and had an aversion to any outward acknowledgments; yet they were sincere believers in a First Cause, which some call Providence, and in the duty of bringing themselves into harmony with the great laws which   M7ay/hew's Southern Experience.  151 govern our spiritual being. They entertained the idea, too, that religion is a constant growth in virtue, and a goodness which blesses as well as professes. If they were wrong, they were, at least, in the way to come out right in the end. Let us be charitable. So Thomas and Florence parted-she with a smile and a great many words of encouragement; he, cheerful and hopeful, with the full determination to succeed in his undertaking. Did he not have some- thing to fight for, dear reader? And do you remem- ber any knight-errant who ever 'had more?  A dulcinea in a castle, witV a grim father as a warder, and a lover challenging knights in the daughter's behalf, is a very pretty spectacle; but does it compare with pretty Florence in her dear little home, who, after all her bravery in parting from her husband, rushed into the sacred privacy of her own room and wept there for an hour? Not tears of grief or sorrow exactly, but tears which had been pent up so long, and which would come now, in spite of all her efforts. As for Mayhew, he was a little heavy at first, but, as the cars-rattled onward and he fell into a reverie, the natural buoyancy of his mind returned, and he began, a, most young men will, full of physical life, to weave those fancies and build those castles in which Hope dwells-the motive power of all exertion. He had his, route all marked out; he knew most of the people he was to see; he had a good knowledge of human nature, and that manner and address which command attention. He had all his accounts proper- ly made out, and he carried with him a few samples of new goods, which he hoped to sell enough of to pay the expenses of his journey.     152     Romance of the Table. Passing through Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, Mayhew halted first at Richmond, where the real business of his trip was to commence. Have I stated that the firm of Speedwell & Turnover was in the cloth trade? And that branch of the great dry goods business comprised a large variety, and there were often opportunities for a rushing trade in some article which might become, for the moment, the object of popular favor. Just before starting, the firm had obtained an agency for a new mill, making a cloth very good and strong, and very cheap also, and especially adapted to the colored people of the South. It had the further recommendation of being gotten up in a variety of fancy colors, some shades of which were very peculiar, and showed a great deal of taste in that very difficult branch of art. Thomas had shown the samples to Mr. Williams, who was a perfect master of the business, and he was delighted with them, and gave him some excellent advice in regard to his movements at the South. Registering his name at the Spottswood House, where he arrived in the evening, too late for business that day, Mayhew, after his ablutions and a light supper, sat down and wrote to the firm, and then a long letter to Florence. Mailing both with his owrn hand, he sought his chamber; and, overcome by fatigue and lost rest, he slept soundly, and far beyonti his usual hour. Somewhat ashamed of his apparent laziness, Thomas hurried to the breakfast-room, and, finishing his meal with far more than his usual celerity, he went into the office and sat down in a corner to look over his memorandums and decide )upon his work for the day.   Mayhew's Southern Experience.   153 While he was thus employed he thought he heard his name pronounced, and looked up. At the same moment an entire stranger turned from the desk, where he had made an inquiry of the clerk, and approached him: "You are Mr. Mayhew, I believe?" "That is my name." "From the firm of Speedwell & Turnover, New York?" "The same." I am glad to see you, sir. My name is Fairman, of this city. I am in a general dry goods business here, and have usually made my purchases in Phila- delphia; but I learn that you have some samples of goods that we are now very short of, suitable for our negro trade, and, if you have no objection, I should like to see them." Thomas looked puzzled. How could this man have known so soon of his arrival and his business? He would have asked the question, but thought it might be impolite; so, instead thereof, he showed his samples in a quiet, business-like manner. The gentleman was evidently much pleased, and asked the prices. These being also given, he asked Thomas what amount he could furnish within sixty days. "I will be frank with you," he said to Thomas. "I should prefer, during the season, to have you sell to us only, in this market, and I will take all you have to spare. I pay cash, and you can draw when you ship the goods; besides which, I will give you ample reference."     154     Romance of the Table. To this arrangement Mayhew could offer no objec- tion. The amount to be taken was, therefore, agreed upon, and the order given. Mr. Fairman gave May- hew his card and a cordial invitation to call, with an offer of his services in any way in which they might be of use. Thomas was delighted. Mr. Fairman was the person of all others to advise him in regard to some accounts he had to collect there; and, with due caution and circumspection, he opened the real subject of his visit. Mr. Fairman did not give him a very favorable account of affairs in Richmond. The city was suffering from the commercial depression, and busi- ness, which had been so long prostrate, would take some time to recover itself. Withal, it was the Southern fashion to delay payments; and Southern traders are far more careless of their credit than Northern men. On the whole, Mr. Fairman thought that something might be done, and that a personal application was the only way to succeed. In a few cases he could be ot material assistance, which he offered to give. Thomas was full of thankfulness, and set about his work that day with a light heart, and when night came he was pretty well satisfied with what he had done. Of course, he met with a good many difficulties, and had to use all his tact and powers of persuasion to accomplish his ends. Promises of "next week," "next month" and "next year" were more abundant than cash; but still there was some money to be had, and some short notes, with an occasional indorser;   Mayhew's Southern Experzince.   155 and Thomas was so polite, yet earnest, and made his approaches in such a gentlemanly fashion, that he succeeded where other men would have failed. One crabbed old fellow, who thought to throw Thomas off by roughness and incivility, was fairly broken down by the perseverance and unfailing good nature of the young man, and at last broke into a hearty fit of laughter. "You will do," he said. "You have beat me, and I own up. I thought you would act like all the rest- throw your account on the desk and rush out in a passion. Come, you shall have some money for your pains. I am short, but something came in quite unexpectedly to-day. I will give you five hundred, and a three-months' note for the remainder. Will that do you?" Mayhew thankfully accepted. "And now let us go and take a drink," said the old gentleman. Thomas said he never drank anything stronger than cider, and that not very often. "Well, if I had known that, I don't know that I would have given you a cent. Cider! Did you never taste old Rye?" "I have ta ;ted it; but I do not like it, and I do not drink it." "Well, co ie, let us take a lunch together, and you may dripk s )ps, if you will. I like you, anyhow, and you may pu me down for a customer; and one who will pay, oo0, it I do bother folks a little."     CHAPTER IV. HE CONTINUES HS JOURNEY, AND GETS-ACQUAINTED WITH LIFE ON THE PLANTATION. Hnman life is everywhere a state in which much is to be endured, and little to be enjoyed. Nature makes us poor only when we want necessaries, but custom gives the name of poverty to the want of superfluities. -Dr. Johnson. In the coming years, when we have approached a little nearer the millenium; when all the past, mingled as it is with the sounds of fife and drum, and the hoarse roar of artillery, shall have faded away and become a tradition, softened by time and toned down by brotherly love; when the discordancies of life shall have changed to its harmonies, and we walk together as one people, then stories of the South as it was before the war will savor of romance, and the African in the field, singing the songs, perchance, of his native land, will come nearer to an ideal being than he is now, or was with the chain of slavery upon his limbs. Antiquity mellows history, and adds thereto much legendary lore which history can hardly claim as its own. Antiquity will give the zest of age to America, as well as to Europe, and posterity will see much which we do not. A painting must have perspective to look well; so can the chronicles of a nation gain by the enchantment of distance.   GlUzipses of Plantation Life.  157 To Mayhew the South was a new field of investiga. tion. He knew it through books and papers, but he had never seen it with his own eyes. He was curious and inquisitive. He went out of his own way to see how people lived, acted, talked. It is an old adage, he said to himself, that "One half the world knows not how the other half lives;" and one half the world ought to be ashamed of itself. But Mayhew did not neglect his affairs, by any means. He merely lost no time. While some people spent their leisure at hotels and in bar and billiard- rooms, he sought exercise for his mind and body by investigating people, and in active walks through the country. Often, sending his valise on by rail, he would walk from one town to another, stopping to see how crops were cultivated, and what implements of husbandry were employed. "If we wish to know of the prosperity of a people," thought Mayhew, "let us find out the foundation on which it rests." Sometimes Mayhew would be eyed suspiciously by the white loungers at the miserable little Southern inns. He was more than once taken for that terrible bugaboo, a Northern Abolitionist, and would, proba- bly, have run considerable risk, but for his frank, open countenance, and the readiness with which he an- swered all inquiries. When a man is honest at heart, it is not so difficult to encounter opposition. May- hew did not go South as an Abolitioiist, and so he preferred to keep his own counsel and incur no trouble that could be avoided; yet he did not hesitate to give his views when he could not well do othci. flvse.     158     Romance of the Table. Mayhew met quite a pleasant and sociable planter near Atlanta, Georgia, in one of his walks from that growing center of railroads and commerce. "Ex- tremes meet," it is said, and there is not much differ- ence, after all, between a Vermont farmer and a Georgia planter. Curiosity is dominant in one; curiosity tinged with suspicion in the other. "You are not an Abolitionist, are ye, stranger?" asked the planter, eyeing Mayhew somewhat askance. "Do I look like one?" replied Mayhew. "No-a," said the planter, in still a little doubt, drawling out the negative. "No-a, you do not look like one. An Abolitionist sneaks around like a whipped cur. He don't dare to tell what his true business is; so he comes as a lect'rer on temperance, or phrenology, or geology; or he looks for a situation as schoolmaster; then he wants to hold prayer-meetings among the negroes, and the next thing we hear is that he's disappeared betwixt two days, and a good fat nigger or two with him." "So the negroes will run away, will they?" asked Mayhew. "Well, you see, stranger, that these fellows have a very insinuating way with 'em; and they work on the minds of the poor darkies with their talks about liberty, and that sort o' stuff, until they make a darky thinkt he North is a paradise, and a black man is as good as a white man. It isn't because we are hard on the niggers; but they are easily imposed on, and ready to believe most anything a white man tells 'em." "As a rule, are the negroes pretty well satisfied with their condition?"   Glimpses of Plantation Life.   159 "Yes; I think they are. Niggers are not so much different from white folks. We have lots of poor whites down here just as lazy and mean as 'possums; but you don't hear of their running away after liberty with Yankee temperance lecturers. Now, a nigger don't like to work any better than a poor white, and half the time he runs away it is to get rid of it. Give him a holiday, and, lor'! how happy he is! He'll gather moss, raise chickens and pigs, do anything to get money to lay out on finery, and to go splurging on a holiday or Sunday; but he don't think of liberty then. It's only when a screamer-,comes along and tells him what a miserable being he is, and about the happy home that waits for him up North, that gives him a hankerin' for somethin' better. Then, if one o' them preachers don't carry him off, he puts pizen in his ears, and he. begins to preach around among the boys and women; and they work themselves up to such a state that they dislike work more than ever, and get fractious and troublesome. Then they are likely to get a whipping, and perhaps that spoils them for work-though I never kn'ew them to lose their liking for corn and bacon." "Do yon think the masters could do anything themselves to make the negroes better satisfied?" "Perhaps they mought." "What effect would a little education have on them?" "Bad." "How so?" "Well, it would only give the Abolitionists a better chance. What's, the use\in making a fellow dissatis- fied with his condition, when it can't be improved?     x60    R2omance of the Table. The nigger, here, is hearty and healthy. He has his own little troubles, I dare say; but does he have as many as you and me?" "Ihope not," said Mayhew, and he sighed. "Then, who is to better their condition?" resumed the planter. "Who is going to take three or four millions of people and provide for them, but our- selves? If we do it, we must do it in our own way. It maya not always be the best way, but it seems to us the best, and we are the best judges, we think. But it's about the darkies' feeding-time. How would you like to see them at their dinner?" "It would please me very much." "Some planters give their hands but half an hour's rest," said the planter, "and feed 'em in the field. I give mine an hour, and let 'em come to their cabins. It rests a white man to go away from his work, and I think it must be the same to the black." Passing out of the main road, where they hd been talking, they entered a lane, and in a moment came in sight of a row of white-washed cabins; and, at the same instant, their ears were saluted with the sounds of negro talk and laughter, which, once heard, are not soon forgotten. "Yah! yah! Hi-i Hi-i! Yah! yah! jist see dat little nig! tah! yah! yah! Hi-i-i!" Curious as to the cause of the negroes' mirth, the two gentlemen approached an inclosure surrounded by a rough picket fence. Here the field-hands were gathered of both sexes. They had just come in from the field; yet their fatigue vanished in a mo- ment, or was forgotten in the merriment caused by some half-dozen naked children. who, at the sight of   Glimpses of Plantation Life.   i61 their "daddies" and "mammies," were making earnest efforts to escape from a large box in which they had been placed by their guardians. One little piece of animated charcoal, plump as a blackberry, and shining as though recently polished with "Day & Martin," had got one foot over the side, but there he stuck. Negro children do not cry so easily as white, and none of these infant specimn'ens of Africa whim- pered. They only danced in their box, chattering like monkeys.    . "Yah! yah!  Hi--i i!" shouted the elders; and one boy, about sixteen, seized the struggling young- ster, held him close in his arms, and, lying down on the ground, rolled over and over, tD the intense delight of the admiring crowd. "They don't look very unhappy-do they?" said the planter. "No," replied Mayhew; "but they seem to be capable of a greater development than they possess. They seem to be very affectionate in their natures." "A nigger is a curious animal," replied the planter- "and he is a good deal of the animal. He attaches himself to any one who treats him kindly, just as a dog would, and if he changes masters he soon forgets his old one for the new. Then he flies, often, to oppo- site extremes, and is very passionate and revengeful. I had a negro, once, who gave me a great deal of trouble. He was good to the children, and would do anything for,the other hands; but he was apt to get in a corner and sulk. I had him strung up and whipped, at last, for I thought it would do him good; but it only made him worse. He was a good hand at the work-bench, and often assisted the carpenter. He "     162    Romance oJ the Table. was at work, one day, in the carpenter's shop when I went there. As soon as he saw me he seized an ax and, raising it, threatened to strike me." "And what did you do?" "Well, I looked him straight in the eye and told him he was a coward and darsn't, and he laid down the ax and went back to his work. From that time he seemed to change, and to be more submissive and obedient. I put him in the field after that, and I believed that changed him. He is now one of my best hands." By this time the hands were at their dinner. The repast was partaken of in a very primitive fashion. Some reclined on the ground, supported on one elbow; some sat on their own door-sills, and some on stumps of trees; while others ate standing or leaning against the fence. A bowl of corn-mush, a lump of corn-bread and a bit of bacon--that was all; and fingers were far more plentiful than forks. In one corner of the inclosure to which I have referred sat a colored woman of so singular an ap- pearance as to attract more than usual attention. She was tall, round-shouldered, as though she had been carrying heavy burthens all her life; her face indicated both negro and Indian blood, and there was a light in her eyes which was not often to be seen among slaves. Her hair, white as snow, fell over her shoulders, after a fashion which gave her a weird and almost savage appearance. "Oh!" said the planter, noticing the direction ot Mayhew's eyes; "that's Cleopatra, head nurse; has been a real tigress, but now she is as mild as new milk. Got religion, she says, and, O, how she can sing!"   Glimpses of Plantation Life.       T63 "Would she sing for me?" sait Mayhew. "Cleo! Cleo!" shouted the planter.   "Cleo. here's a Methodist from the North, and he wants to hear you sing. Tune up a bit, can't ye?" Cleopatra raised her eyes more to the sky than to her master or Mayhew, and the latter fancied he saw a transformation in her countenance, such as might be given by some spiritual operation within the mind, or an inspiration which makes its possessor oblivious of all external influences or surroundings. Then Cleo sang, or rather chanted, in that peculiar sympathetic voice for which those having negro blood are remarkable, the following words: "There is a Heaven-that I know, For the Lord Jesus told me so. Come, go along with me! There de sister meets de brudder; There one friend shall meet anudder O, come along and see! For Jesus told me so. Oh, ho! Oh, ho The Lord Jesus told me so, Oh, ho! Dere we shall not be alone, But wid de angels 'round de t'rone. Oh, glory Come wid me! He will feed us wid His Heavenly grace, And we shall see Him face to face- O, come along and see 1 For Jesus told me so, Oh, ho! Oh. ho! The Lord Jesus told me so, Oh, ho! O! let our happy voices ring, Oh, glory! Yes, ob glory sing! Come, journey 'long wid me We're goin' to de promised land, Take me, children, by de hand, And go along wid me.  For Jesus told me so, Oh, ho! Oh, ho! The Lord Jesus told me so, Oh, ho 1"     164     Romance of the Table. The refrain of these verses was taken up by the hands, and the effect was wonderful. There is an ancient tradition that, somewhere in Africa, is a tribe of people who arethe particular favorites of Heaven, and that all were originally in a state of childish -simplicity and innocence. Mayhew thought, as he listened, that he was taken back to those primitive days of direct communication between Heaven and earth, and he fell into a deep reverie, from which he was recalled by the voice of the planter: "I say, stranger, must you go back to Atlanta to-night?" "Not necessarily," replied Mayhew. "I am de- tained, waiting for a merchant who will be there to-morrow." "Well, stranger, as you ar'n't either an Abolitionist or a phrenology-lecturer, it you have a mind to stop with me over night you are welcome; and if you would like to have a story from Cleo-and she can tell one straight-we will have her over after tea, when the women are back from the field, and can take care of their own children." Mayhew thankfully accepted the invitation. It gave him another opportunity to study Southern life and manners; and he was pleased, too, with the open, generous nature of his entertainer, whose name- giving his own-he ascertained to be Rhett. Mr. Rhett lived in an old-fashioned Georgia man- sion; all the rooms on one floor, with plenty of windows and piazzas, and an endless number of out- buildings. His family consisted of his wife-good- looking, but indolent; a son and daughter, and two   Glimpses of Plantation Life.   165 or three dependent relatives, great on tobacco and horse-flesh, but of no perceptible advantage to the world. The afternoon was spent in driving, in talking about the crops past and prospective, and in an after- dinner siesta, when all the family slept for an hour, while Thomas wrote to his wife and friends in the North. /     CHAPTER V. CLEOPATRA TELLS A STORY OF A PLANTATION-DINNER. ro weary hearts, to mourning homes God's meekest angel gently comes; No power has he to banish pain, Or give us back our lost again; And yet, in tenderest love, our dear And Heavenly Father sends him here.-Whittier. True to his promise, Mr. Rhett sent for Cleopatra in the. evening. The weather was warm, and the whole family were seated on the piazza. There tea had been served, Southern fashion, and there the gentlemen who wished smoked, and those who did not, chatted with the ladies. "Cleopatra," said her master, as that servitor appeared, "this gentleman would like to hear that story of the Indians in Texas, which you told the boys, once. Sit down on the step, there, and let's have it." "I shall be very glad if you will," said Mayhew, kindly. "I am a stranger here, and very pleased to hear all I can." "Thank you, massa.' said Cleopatra.  "I ain't much of a talker, sir, but [ will tell it as well as I can, massa." I give the story as Cleopatra told it, only changing the dialect, as being more convenient to myself and the reader. The woman had a musical voice, and a facility of expression which, in one of her limited   A Plantation Dinner.      167 knowledge, was quite extraordinary. Clasping one knee with her hands, and giving a slight rocking motion to her body, Cleopatra told her story, as follows: "I do not know what year it was in, massa; but it was a long while ago, and I was a young woman then-though I had been married two years, or more, and had one little picaninny, just running alone. "My husband had come across the border from Arkansas; but I was born in Texas, my father being a half-breed, and my mother a Louisiana mulatto. When I was married, my husband's master bought me, and I was made the cook. Philip-that was my husband's name-saw to the horses and cattle. "Those were troublesome times in Texas, massa. There were a great many bad men, who did not seem to have much to do but to quarrel with, and shoot, each other; and the Indians were troublesome, too, and there were troubles with the Mexicans; so every man's house was a fort, and guns and pistols and knives were always on hand, and in pretty constant use. "But, somehow, when the Lord sends troubles to afflict people, or to try them, He sends a good many together; and, as He says in the blessed Book that a man's foes are those of his own household, so it happened, then, that there were troubles inside the camp almost as great as those outside, and the way it came about was this: "There were some bad colored people around, as well as whites, and they were accused of doing more than they really did do. If cattle were run off, or a barn set on fire, or a hen-roost robbed, and no one     168     Romance of the Table. knew who did it, the colored boys were very apt to have the credit of it; and the white folks, being quick and passionate, were almost sure to pick up a lazy negro, or one found loafing 'ound, and give him thirty-nine lashes on the bare back. It did not make much difference about his protesting his innocence. It might be, they said, that he did it-and, if he didn't, it would be a warning to those who did, so it was all right; and if the fellow complained he was treated, likely, to an extra dozen lashes. "But this made all the darkies revengeful, and they used to steal out at night and get together in the roads or swamps, and talk over their grievances; and f sometimes, just out of spite, they would steal a few chickens, and eat them, too, roasting them before a fire of sticks and brush-wood. It was a great deal worse if they managed to get hold of any fire-water, as they often did, for they were good for nothing the next day, and were often punished in consequence. "In fact, massa, it was a very bad country, and the times were very hard. There was no money, and people lived hand to mouth, like, sometimes having plenty, and sometimes going hungry; and there was no order or system, but every man took care of himself in the best way he could. If the white people were short of provisions they would go hunting or fishing, and leave the blacks without any, head; and this made them idle and wicked. Satan always finds some mischief for lazy folks; don't he, massa?' "I believe he does," said Mayhew.. "Well, I think he does, and I know that in Texas lazy people always were in mischief. I never knew one to be engaged in anything useful.   A Plantation Dinner.     I69 "Somehow, the white people heard about the meetings of the blacks, and they thought there was a plot of some kind, and that there was to be a rising, and they were very much alarmed. The Indians had been troublesome, and a good many cattle had been stolen and driven off; so the whites had their hands full. They did not dare trust the black folks with arms to help fight white folks, and they were too widely scattered to do much by themselves; and, instead of trying, as you white folks do, to make friends of those around them, they only treated the blacks with more severity, and were all the time knocking them -down or kicking them. It does seem to me, massa, that God's way is the best-to love one another, as He has loved us; and I do think, if the white people had treated the poor black folks as our massa treats us, that everything would have gone on better. As it was, there was no danger of any rising, although some of the blacks were very bitter and revengeful, and were quite willing to do any- thing. But what could poor, ignorant, black people do without arms, and without any one to help them? The whole country was ready to rise at once against the negroes, though Indians and Mexicans were always waited for, and often carried off their booty without meeting any opposition at all.  "So things went on for a year, massa; and some- times there would a few emigrants come in, and the white people felt stronger than they had done before; and they got in their crop better, and we had more to eat than ever before, and there were talks of making a fort, so as to keep the Indians at a distance; but, as almost always happens, when people are r     170    Romance of the Table. prospered they forget the Lord, and think all they have belongs to themselves. "Well, massa, about a year after the times I first spoke about there was a horseman came galloping into the settlement. No one knew him; but he had plenty of pistols, and his horse was all in a foam, and he seemed to be more Mexican than Indian. But it is hard, sometimes, to tell one from another, where all are so mixed up, and no one knows who is a friend and who is an enemy. "Then this man on a horse-he was only a mus- tang, massa, but strong and quick-said that the Indians were gathering about five miles up the river; and he wanted all the men to turn-ut and help drive them away. Well, the planters liked the idea, for they had not had a fight for some time, and they had no objections to a brush with the Indians, for it might prevent them coming nearer the settlement. So they saddled their horses and slung their guns across their shoulders, hunter fashion, and stuck their pistols and knives into their belts, and off they went, the horses kicking up the dust as though they were anxious for a fight as well as their masters. "It was early in the morning when they mounted and were off, and the boys-the black boys, I mean, massa-thought they might as well have a holiday and a frolic; and, as the weather was hot, they all went into the woods by the river. "Some fished, and caught a nice lot, and then they came after us women-folks to go down with them and have dinner, when it was cool and pleasant; and when we got there we found a nice little sucking-pig and some chickens, all dressed and ready for the fire.   A Plantation Dinner.     171 And there was an old 6pt full of hominy, and plenty of bread. The boys said they had borrowed the things, and then they laughed. We could do nothing, we poor women, massa; yet, though the Lord had not converted me then, and given me a clean heart, I did feel bad, massa. "So we cooked the dinner, broiling the fish on the hot coals, and roasting the chickens and pig hung up by a string before the fire. Then we sat down on the ground, and had a good time. We had no dishes, so we used pieces of bark, and we had only the knives to cut with which the b:ys carry In their pockets. Our fingers had to do for forks, massa, and they traveled pretty lively. "There was no other picaninny than mine there, massa, though there were some half-grown boys; but the fact is, massa, women and babies were both scarce in that part of Texas, just then. My little fellow was rolling on the ground and kicking up his heels, just as happy as a little darky can be, when he is full of pig and chicken. The boys were lying around under the trees, except a few, who were sitting with their feet in the river, and throwing stones at the fish as they glided by. "It was very warm, too, and there was hardly a breath of air stirring. Those who had their feet in the water were the most comfortable, except those who were asleep; but I never liked to be idle, massa, and so, while the rest seemed so peaceful and happy, I took out my knitting and kept my fingers busy I could work, you know, massa, and watch the father and the bov.     172     Romance of the Table. "But I had pretty sharp ears then, massa; yet, whether it was the heavy air or coming evil, I can't tell, but there was something-not a noise exactly-- which made me turn my head sharply round. "Oh! how I did jump, massa. I was too frightened to scream, for there were three pair of eyes like snakes glaring at us from a little rising ground just back of the river; and the eyes belonged to the Indians, massa. "I jumped to my feet, and that started my husband, and he jumped up with the boy in his arms, and ran to take shelter behind some trees. The Indians saw they were discovered, and, like the flash of the light- ning, they rose from their hiding-place, and let fly a shower of arrows from their bows. They came whiz- zing past me, and oh, massa, two of them struck my husband and our boy!" Here Cleopatra stopped speaking for a moment, sitting perfectly still, and gazing straight forward, as though in the moon's shadow she saw her husband and her boy. It was a compliment to her story, too, that the company on the piazza sat as mute as she. Shortly, however, with a long, mournful sigh, Cleopatra commenced her rocking motion, and, in a lower tone of voice, resumed her story: "I hardly know what happened next, massa, for I fell down in a swoon, like, and then, when I opened my eyes again, I heard such a hollering and shouting that I forgot what had happened; but in :t moment it all came back to me, and then I screamed and shout- ed, too, and I fell upon the ground by the side of imy dead husband and boy, and buried my face in the sod. The Indians and the whites were fighting, then, like s-:   A Plantation Dinner.     173 wild beasts-for, as I heard after it was all over, the white men had been deceived by a half-breed scout, who had lured them away that the Indians might come in and- rob. But the whites found out their blunder, and came back on the gallop, just in time to save the cattle from being driven away, and the whole place burned. They killed some of the Indians, and the rest scampered away as fast as their horses would carry theim. But I thought neither of the fight nor of the trampling horses, as I lay upon the ground, and cried out in my agony, 'O Joe! Joe! where are you, my darling?' SAnd then I went into another faint, and, when I awoke again, I was lying upon a bed in one of the cabins, and the colored women were fanning me; and then I was quiet, and I thought I heard a voice saying, 'Do not mourn, mamma, for it was the Lord's will.' "But it was many days before I could work again, for whenever I thought'of my great loss I would fall to the ground, and clutch the sod and cry and moan, 'O Joe, Joe! O my husband!' "But after a long while the peace of the Lord stole into my heart, and I only wept a little; and then the light came, and the love, and I knew the Lord was good, even as the good book says. And then I thanked Him, massa, even though He had taken my husband and my boy." J   ,        ,     CHAPTER VI. NEW ORLEANS, AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THOMAS THERE. "Hail! and welcome!" they exclaimed, with one voice. "Be seLted, and command us."-The Haunted King. Mayhew's experience of Southern life, so far, had not been disagreeable. There was a certain blunt frankness which suited him; and, if with it there were less of those signs of energy, economy, or thrift than he had been accustomed to, he reflected that it would be impossible, in a country of so vast an extent, for all the people to be homogeneous, and that the surroundings ot a man have much to do with forming his character. Slavery, undoubtedly, led to a larger development of self-esteem-to a hauteur almost unknown where man works out his own destiny with both head and hands; and we perceive, too, as we go toward the tropics, those changes in habits and in mental action with which climate has much to do. Disinclined as white men are, in Southern States, to great physical exertion, or, as a rule, perhaps, to mental application, there is a greater development of hospitable and liberal sentiments, and a generous living which economy would hardly justify. South- ern men, before the war, were famous for their un- stinted liberality. They were too generous, or, as we would say, too extravagant, for their own good; and, naking money profusely, they managed to be always in debt. Honest, at least as the avorage of men, they were more careless of their credit, and Drovided less   What Happened in New Orleans.     j 5 carefully for the future, than other people would be apt to; yet, it is to their credit that the trade of the South was sought for and cultivated as being the best which came to the Northern cities. If they were a little thoughtless of the effect their dilatoriness in payments would have upon their creditors they paid better profits at the beginning than others, and were sure to pay the debt some time or other. So Mayhew went on his journey with varying suc- cess. Always courteously received, and making friends wherever he went, he made some settlements, sold some goods, obtained valuable information in regard to the commercial standing of people, and was thus prepared for the business of the future. But, above all, Mayhew steadily acquired a confi- dence in himself, and developed an ability to cope with the world as he found it. He learned the wise lesson that, as the Creator did not form men alike, so they were not to be treated alike. To win the confi- dence of a man we must first show him that we are worthy of it; and to do this requires no little acquaint- ance with human nature, and no little adaptability to circumstances. To " be all things to all men" may be doubtful morality; but to reach men by placing ourselves upon the same mental platform they occupy has long Deen considered a necessity. The preacher who flies above or plunges below his congregation will never be successful in his ministrations. Of course, 1 do not mean that a man should ever put himseit in a position to lose his self-respect. When that is likely to happen he had better seek other ways of accomplishing his objects, or other fields for the employment of his talents.  s     I 76    Romance of the Table. At Montgomery Mavhew saw, for the first time, an auction-sale of slaves. It shocked his feelings beyond all that he had previously endured. A woman and her child-the first voung and quite pretty, the latter nearly white--were sold together; and Mayhew asked himself the question whether, if a change of ownership were desirable, or a necessity, it might not have been effected in a way to lessen the pain and humiliation? The great, strapping, black fellcws who were placed upon the block did not seem to feel the degradation of being thus disposed of; but the quiet little woman and her baby haunted Mayhew's thoughts for many a day thereafter. From Montgomery Mayhew sailed down the Ala- bama River to Mobile, and, having no business there, he took the boat, the day of his arrival, for the city of New Orleans. Here he found himself in a society and in an element which at first bewildered him. There was a great deal of the rush and hurry of the North, for much of the business was in the hands of the Northern men, with a strange mixture of elements found in no other State in the Union. It is hardly necessary for me to describe the Crescent City. Every one has seen it, or read about it; and its divis- ion into French and American quarters by one long, wide street; its general cosmopolitan character; its immense levee and forest of steamers; its gayety and life, have been themes of many tongues, and subjects for many pens. Mayhew rested here for a day or two, HHe felt strange and uncomfortable. The air seemed to oppress him, and he breathed with difficulty. He did not know how to speak to men, here, and he waited   What Ha3ppened iz NVew Orleans.   17; for his head to cease whirling, and for his coolness and confidence to return. Then he made his first call. It was on a firm who owed but a small amount, and Mayhew took care to say nothing about it, but merely to introduce himself and his goods. Mr. Velpeau-French by extraction, as his name implied-received him pleasantly. "Trade is very dull now,;' said Mr. Velpeau, " but I will look at your samples, and we may want some- thing by and by. Come, sit down and have a smoke." "I never smoke, thank you," replied Mayhew. "Oh, very well; everybody smokes here." "So I perceive." "And I'll bet a cigar you do not drink!' "You are quite right." "How, then, do you manage to get through the world, and how do you get around people?" "By letting them do as they please, on condition that they let me do the same." "Yes; but there is sociality in a cigar, aid people cannot be sociable if they cannot share in each others' pleasures." "In some way I do share in them. I do not dislike the odor of a cigar, and I take pleasure in seeing you enjoy yourself. Now, see my advantage as a business man. You feel happy and contented while you are smoking, and let me do most of the talking. So I pull out my memorandum-book-for I know you are going to give me an order-and I expatiate on the beauty of my samples; while you have nothing to do but tacitly assent to what I am saving." 12     178     Romanice of the Table. "Well, I rather like that, young man. You have some brass, anyhow, and I like you; so go ahead and sell me something." So Thomas displayed his wares, and Mr. Velpeau smoked, and expressed his satisfaction. "How do you know you can trust me?" said Mr. Velpeau. "Well, I made up my mind as soon as I came in that if you were not good for a bill of goods you would tell me so. I am a young man, just starting in' life, and, of course, anxious to succeed. As soon as I saw you I came to the conclusion that you would buy from me, if you could pay, and not, if not. I am willing to take the risk." Mr. Velpeau looked at Mayhew for a moment, puffing away at his cigar, meanwhile, and then he said: "Do we not owe you something already?" "Yes, I believe you do-a trifle." "And you sent your account more than two months ago?" "Yes." "And I never answered it. There's my careless- ness, you see. But now, before going any further, let me draw you a check for that;" and the merchant, turning to his ledger for the amount, drew a check, handed it to Thomas, took his receipt, and then said: "There, that will do for to-day. I have an engage- ment now; come and dine with me and we will talk of goods to-morrow." At the house of Mr. Velpeau, Mayhew met several gentlemen, and was much pleased with the courtesy extended to him. No one referred to the tact that he   lVzat HapApvmd in New Orleans.    I79 was drinking water, while the rest drank wine, and he exerted himself to create a fa7orable impression. The dinner was hearty; too profuse and solid, May- hew thought, for the climate: soup, fish, meat, game, vegetables, pudding, pastry, oranges, bananas, nuts, ice-cream, and the usual cup of coffee; then an ad- journment to the piazza, and the customary smoke. "Well," thought Mayhew, " if people live like this, in New Orleans, I do not wonder they are sometimes behind in their remittances.' For a week, now, Mayhew addressed himself to his business. He found more people ready to dine him than ready to pay him, and he could not but occasion- ally feel amused at the way other people than himself had studied human nature. Those who were the least ready to pay were often the heartiest in their welcome, and the most spontaneous in their invita- tions. "What! You Mayhew-firm Soeedwell & Turn. over! "Yes, that is my name." "How are you? Glad to see you-heard of you often. Come, let us go and have a talk." The "talk" would be in a restaurant, or lunch-room, over\ some refreshments; and great would be the disappointment when Mayhew would not drink a bottle of wine. "Now, you want money, I know," Slowcoach would say; "but haven't got any. No collections, you know, at this season of the year. Planters are hard up, too-buying niggers all the time, blast 'em, and running in debt for their goods.

Then, with much tact, Mayhew would try to get something, anca, falling into his customer's vein of talk, he would say: "Well, now, don't be hard on a stranger You see, lye are mighty short at the North-that's a fact, but i suppose we can squeeze through; only, you see, this is my first trip. and it would hardly be a fair thing to send me back empty-handed.

You give excellent dinners, down here; and, if it were not foi the wife, I might be induced to stay and 'board it out' as we say at the North." Slowcoach laughed, and told an Trish story of how a man was ruined by entertaining his creditors, instead of paying them. "Well, I will squeeze something out, to get rid of you. In fact, when you Northern men come along, there is no bluffing you off. We have to buy goods we do not want, and pay for them without any money. Come, let us go back to the office, and see if the bank-account will bear squeezing. The result of the investigation was "something on account,' and the liberty to draw a draft foi the balance at four months.   What Happenea zi New Orleans     78i So Mayhew progressed, making friends, as usual and when the time came to take boat for "up river. he could, at least, say he had done his duty well. and could rest from his labors with a serene conscience ana a tolerably full pocket-boohk,     C IAPTER     VII U1FE AND DEATH ON THE MSSISSIPPI RIVER. The rivers and the torrents, where they dwell, Sweep many a green declivity away, And plungoe at length, groanina, into the deep From thei ills headlong, leaving where they passed No traces of the pleasant walks of man.--Homer. There was a time, not more than twenty-five years ago, when the Mississippi River was as great a novelty, to a majority of the people, as the Nile; and it was only those who lived in the vicinity, or those who were forced thither by business, that made the acquaint- ance of the father of waters A panorama of the river from New Orleans to St. Louis drew crowded audiences, in the eastern cities, for many months. The travel between New Orleans and New York at that time was either by sea--and in sailing vessels, at that-or by the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers to Pitts- burg, crossing the Allegany mountains in coaches Either journey was long, and apt to be disagreeable, and a greater preparation was necessary to under- 1aking it than will now suffice for England and a Continental tour. As railroads multiplied, Cincinnati became the point to start from, on the downward iourney; then followed St. Louis and Cairo, and the jolting trip over the mountains became a thing of the past   Life and Death on the MississipApi. 183 But the great river itself has not changed, and its turbid flow, its imighty volume of water, carrying the mountains to the sea, is the same now as when De Soto pioneered the way of civilization to its banks. It is still, to strangers, one of the mighty curiosities of the Western Continent, and he who has sailed upon its surface has become familiar with one of the wonders of the Universe. There is no beauty in the Mississippi. It has no grandeur, except in its wonderful length, width, and depth.: in the unceasing flood of yellow water, which, with mighty and irresistible power. finds its way from the icy North to the tropic South. Assisted by spring, floods or the melting snows, the Mississippi becomes terrible and destructive. It forms for .tself new channels. and it breaks away the strongest barriers man may erect, as a woman snaps the thread she is sewing with. Then the river becomes a vast inland sea, and ns far as the eye can reach, we gaze upon nothing but the broad expanse of water, and the tops of trees which indicate the land beneath. A journey upon the Mississippi, in a good boat, is by no means an unpleasant event in a lifetime. There is generally a goodly company, and always a good table. There is room for promenading, and plenty of time for reading, writing, or conversing. The trequent landings give, or, rather, gave glances at Southern life of a picturesque character, and there were many incidents to be remembered and carried home for the delectation of wondering ears at the fireside. But, if there were incidents to amuse, there were also accidents to terrify; and many have been the tragedies enacted upon that treacherous river, coming,     184    Rlomance of the Table. too, with such startling suddenness as to unnerve the boldest. The greatest foes of tie traveler are the "snags " and " sawyers" which lie hidden beneath the surface of the river, and fire. There is no remedy for the former, and the trail boats, constructed of lightest materials, give every encouragement to the latter to leap from its boundaries. Should accident favor it- a too close proximity to cotton, for instance, o1 some material still more inflammable-the entire structure may be enveloped in flames in a single moment. At the time of which 1 write, however, the railway had penetrated, or passed around, mountains; had crossed rivers and stretched over plains, and the journey, either way, had been robbed ot much of its terror and a great deal of its romance; the river becoming less a general highway of traffic, and more a local avenue of commerce Many travel upon it, too, to say they have done so, and many because they prefer that mode of traveling to the hot and dusty cars. Mayhew concluded to ascend the river, because he had business at Memphis; and he preferred a change in the mode of traveling he had so far followed. He took the precaution, at New Orleans, to send everything, in the shape of notes and money, to the North by mail, and when he stepped upon the boat, he had only what was necessary for his homeward expenses in his pocket, with his valise in his hand. And Mayhew went on board with a light heart. He had succeeded quite as well as he expected; he had made many friends in New. Orleans, as elsewhere, and his face was turned toward home.

After all, it is within ourselves we must look for those ineffable riches which fill the world with melody and beauty. The fairest fingers, and most nimble, can produce no music without the strings of the harp, or the keys of the piano, to operate upon; and all the living charms of h6me are valueless without that responsive nature which yields to the slightest touch. Home! When the cheek flushes and the eye fills with tears at the word; when the nervous system thrills with electricity as the heart draws the picture of our own fireside; then home becomes a reality, and is alive with spiritual blossomings. And thus felt Thomas as he stepped upon the deck of the steamer, which, with chimneys belching forth clouds of smoke, and steam-whistle shrilly screaming forth notes of preparation, seemed to enter into Mayhew's feelings, and to tremble with desire to be away upon the long journey. There was the usual queer mingling of people and nationalities-for New Orleans, probably, offers a greater variety of the latter than New York. There was a dapper Englishman, who was very attentive to the young ladies, and who lost his hat overboard on the first day out. There were Swedes, Portuguese, and a Russian count. There were Southerners, going North to travel, or purchase goods; and Northerners, who, like Mayhew, had been South, to trade and bargain there. Men from the Eastern States were still as easily located as ever, though some had resided long enough at the South to get rid of their peculiarities. The native Southern man, with his incessant cigar and unapproachable self-possession, was as distant a type as though from a foreign land.     186     Romance of the Table. The long cabins of one of these boats are very pleasant, and the ladies are exceedingly affable. There is nothing like a voyage to bring people to- gether kindly and unselfishy. It is true that, during the day, the sexes are very apt to separate: the gentle- men to smoke, play cards, talk politics and business, or to tell stories;' and the ladies to read, or, making a little fancy work an excuse, to indulge in those pleasant and often confidential little tetes-a-etees which are beyond masculine comprehension, and which are yet so very delicious, no doubt. But in the evening the saloon becomes a drawing- room, and the hum of conversation, with the frequent musical interludes, give life and animation to what was before dull and commonplace. Cards, too, are in use, with chess, draughts, and backgammon. The children, if any are on board, have their own little games until thev are sent to bed; ana the hour for a general breaking up is uniform. Thomas made himself useful, rather than orna- mental. He spoke French fluently, and was, there- fore, an acquisition to several young ladies from the French side of New Orleans, who did not speak English well; who were on their way to the North for the first time, and who had never seen a hill, nor a stone, except those used in buildings. Inveterate novel-readers, too, were these same young ladies; and, as the boat approached Vicksburg, and Thomas ran into the cabin to announce that the long-expected colline was in sight, the young ladies dropped their books, ran out with wonder-dilated eyes, and as rley gazed at the novel sight before them they threw up their hands and exclaimed, "A'on Dieu! C'est   Life and Death on the MississzAZpi. 187 magnmiue!" and rushed back again to the more exciting chapters which the hill had broken in upon. Sometimes there is a ripple in the daily current of life on a steamer-enough to give a turn to conversa- tion, and sufficient to show the gulf between the uppet and lower stratas of life and society, even there: and this ripple came in the present voyage of the Southern Palm. The lower deck of a Mississippi boat is devoted to the machinery, the crew, and to the poorer passengers, who furnish their own beds and provisions, and are forced to be content with such comforts as a deck affords. The scene, especially at night, with the blazing fires of cotton-wood, and the dusky forms almost constantly engaged in feeding them, is wild enough and weird enough to inspire a picture. But there is nothing in the daily lives of either pas- sengers or crew to gratify any cultivated taste, or afford satisfaction to any but those who are in search of temporary sensations. About dusk, on the third evening out, the cry arose, "Man overboard!-Man overboard!" and the huge monster, in a moment more, stopped her hoarse breathing, and lay at rest upon the sluggish stream. Two poor men, passengers for Louisville, sitting upon the slight bulwark of the steamer, had by some accident lost their balance, and in a moment were in the water. One, a tolerable swimmer, struck out for the shore; the other, making a desperate attempt to keep afloat, exhausted himself with his struggles, and sank. All was confusion and excitement. A boat was lowered in an instant, and the swimmer-a sturdy,     188 $Romance of tIe Table. athletic Irishman--was overtaken and nulled on board. Then the crew sought anxiously for the other; but, whether through the sudden shock he had became insensible, or whether he had been carried down by a strong under-current, could never be known. He was seen no more, and the boat returned reluctantly to the steamer without him. But at the South and West a human life counts for little. Its loss is, inaeecd, out a ripple on the sea; and, ere the night had fairly closed in, the gavety of the saloon had returned, and the event was almost forgot ten. Down stairs, among the poor, who huddled around the great fires, the talk was low and earnest  and many a story was told of hair-breadth escapes, and the dangers of the land and sea.   CHAPTER     VIII. STRONG MEATS, STRONG DRINKS, AND PLENTY OF THEM. O! wist a man how many maladies, Followers of excess a-d of gluttonies, He woulde be the more measurable Of his diet, setting at his table. Alas! the shorte throat, the tender mouth, Makest that East and West and North and South, In earth, in air, in water, men to swink, To get a glutton dainty meat and drink.-Chaucer. The try- to Memphis ended without any other notable event. Thomas, during the voyage up the river, paid, as may be supposed, some attention to the table, and he was more amused than gratified at the free and easy way in which meals on a Western steamer are served and eaten. If his tastes were somewhat fastidious, he had still that amount of good sense which enables a man to adapt himself to any ordinary events in life; and he neither lost his appetite, nor grew morose or fidgety, over the petty annoyances inseparable from the changing latitude and longitude of a traveler's life. With an egg and a potato, a crust of bread and a glass of water, he could set hunger at defiance, and laugh at all the minor miseries of life, In the palmy days of -Solthern steamboat-traveling the pretensions to elegance on the first-class boats were well-grounded; and the enjoyments of the table were hightened by the fact that sea-sickness and lurching crafts were unknown. The trips were not too long to enable the steward fo carry an abundance of Southern     Igo     Romtnce of the Table. fruits and delicacies; and poultry, being alive until wanted, were always 'fresh. Abundance was, of course, the marked characteristic, rather than a nice taste in preparation; but from the abundance even a delicate appetite might be reasonably satisfied, if not destroyed, by that prodigal supply to which I have referred, and by the mingling of odors which, alone, seem to contain a certain amount of nutriment. Roast and boiled, fried and stewed, fish and fowl, soups and sauces, attempts at French entrees; little side-dishes, needing explanation to determine the name and quality; vegetables, as usual, very badly cooked, and bread of a mystical quality, made up a showy, and, to hearty eaters, a substantial dinner. Now, there were hearty eaters on that boat-men who could eat of every dish, and feel no surfeit; who never stopped to ask whether a dish was well-cooked or wholesome; who ate pickles .with their fruit, and cabbage with their ices, or so near to each other that the sensations conveyed to the stomach were nearly instantaneous, and very dissimilar. Claret wine, by no means better than vin ordinaire, was free, after the French fashion. Those who wanted something better or stronger had but to order. The demands in that line were never too great for the capacity of the boat; and, if Mayhew marveled at the capacity of the human stomach for food, he was none the less astonished at its powers of fluid assimilation. Strong drinks-liquid-lightning, miscalled stimulants, without fire can be so called, stimulating and destroy- ing at the same time-went down human throats in endless streams. Gin and bitters introduced the breakfast, sherry and bitters the dinner, while divers   Strong AMeats and Strong- Drinks.  191 fiery compounds, which only a civilized and Christian people can produce, served to fill up the yawning vacancies from meal to meal. Yet, the water of the great river is the delight of the people upon its banks--that is, they praise it. little though they may drink of it. "Taste of the Mississippi," say they, "and you will return to it again." Think of the clear, surging brook in which,  as in a mirror, you saw yourself reflected in your school-days, and then look at the chocolate-colored river on which you are sailing! The difference is striking and startling. Fill your glass with it un- filtered, and you revolt neem. con. Yet is the. water sweet to the taste, and, settled or filtered, with a lump of ice, is as wholesome, probably, as any other water we are apt to find. In that muddy sediment lies the seed of a continent. The hundreds of miles of rich soil from the mouth of the river to Vicksburg has been formed from the deposit of such minute particles of earth as you see in your tumbler. And the Father of Waters by no means likes to be hemmed in. He believes, or whuld believe, were he capable of thought and expression, in that state of existence he enjoyed before men invented dikes. Then he ould have sung with the poet-- "' No pent-up Utica contracts our powers, But the whole boundless universe is ours 1' And Father Mississippi could fairly enter a claim to ownership, for he did his share in creating. He rebels, too, against these mud embankments, and, once in a while, he rises in his wrath and snaps them asun- der, as Samson snapped the new cords with which the     I92     Romance of the Table. Philistines bound him. When he does this, and then retires with slow and obstinate novement, he leaves behind him almost a gold-mine. He has added to the depth of the soil, and to its richness. The overflow of the Mississippi, in results, is the same as the over- flow of the Nile; and, could the flow of the water but he regulated and damage prevented, it would be wel- comed by every planter upon its shores. Hemmed in by levees, however, the river rolls onward to the sea, and carries thither the mountains and the hills, which seem to be the store houses of Nature from which can be elaborated other lands for man to cultivate, and other homes for the coming children of men. Mayhew drank of the water, and, in drinking, he seemed to imbibe its majesty and power. Far as the eye could reach, at times, stretched the desolate waters; but there was an awful sublimity, to Thomas, in its mere volume! The mind sinks into helpless- ness as it strives to contemplate the vast reservoirs of waters which feed the mighty river and the mountains and hills which gather it and send it onward, through field and forest, from the regions of everlasting snows to where ice is never known, and where the Frost King rarely visits. -%   CHAPTER IX.

If the direction is in a familiar hand, and that hand a beloved one, very likely peace enters the soul; for we believe, then, that all is well. After long expectancy even a few lines are worth more than a library of books. As a single drop of the essential oil of a flower will perfume a house, so will one word from a dear one fill all the chambers of the mind, and carry us on the pinions of affection from earth to Heaven. Thomas was a faithful correspondent. He could write anywhere, and  under any  circumstances. Sometimes, in the cars, he would write, using his hat for a desk; and, having directed envelopes in his wallet, he would jump out at a station where he might see a letter-box, and, dropping the messenger therein, go on his way all the lighter-hearted for having done this much toward making some one else so. 13     194     Romance of the Table. And it was rare, indeed, that, at whatever town or city he might stop, he did not find an abundance of welcome messengers for himself, in return; for he so timed his journey as to be able to inform his wife and his friends where he would be on such and such a day. Florence, especially, seemed to run lightly ahead of him with anticipatory footsteps, leaving smiles and hopeful words, kisses and encouragements, for him to pick up as he followed after. It was always "come home!" with Florence, yet not so much in words as in the attractions which home was con- stantly presenting. Nay, so far as words went, Flor- ence rather said "stay away," for not once did she urge the slightest neglect of duty, or give any encour- agement to leave his work improperly, or hastily, performed. At Memphis, Mayhew found the usual mail. There were letters from his employers, one from each of his Home-Club friends, one from Mr. Williams, one from his father and mother, and three from Florence. Going to his hotel, Thomas first removed all marks of travel, put himself in trim to face company, and then sat quietly down in his own room to read. The letters from home, of course, came first; and now-- with his face turned fairly toward it, but a few days' journey distant, at the most-a yearning came into his heart such as he had not felt before; and the feeling was heightened as he read. There seemed to be a strangeness about the letters from his wife. They were as loving as usual, and even more tender; yet there was something about them he could not under- stand-something new. They did not say "come home," yet they seemed to mean it, and Thomas felt   A PlzZosofihz Fragment.     95 that he was wanted. H e noticed one singular thing: his wife did not say she was zell; and then, again, there was a lack of firmness in the writing, and the lines were not quite so straight as Florence usually wrote them. As he read the last words, Thomas fell into a reverie, and sat there, listlessly thinking, as men will, until the gong sounded for dinner; and there were his letters still unopened, or most of them. Even at dinner Mayhew did not get over his abstraction, He wondered what could make him feel so, and why it was that all the way from home there should come such unusual pleadings-for he felt them to be such, without their being defined in his letters or in his own mind. lHe felt as tender-hearted people do at the Sound of a bird or a young child, in distress when impllse is strong to go to its relief. But Thomas shook off the depression, after a while, and set himself resolutely at his work, as was his custom. He knew that nothing serious could be the matter, and he was satisfied, from the tone of other letters received by him, that there could be nothing to seriously disturb his peace of mind. "Only a few days more!" said Thomas to himself Only a few days! They were rather long, although the summer had passed away, and the almanac said they were growing short. They seemed longer to Thomas than any he had ever known, and only a strong sense of responsibility kept him, now, at the post of duty  He satisfied a part of his' longing by writing an extra long letter to Florence, in which he poured uut his desire to be once more by her side. ;s-:/^,",rs1?^ ;^        196     Romance of the Table. Shall I give a part of it? Lovers' love-letters are very common; why should a husband's love letters not be a possibility? MEMPHS, Sept. 21, 1858. e  e.  5      *     * L "I-ad I ever any doubts of the reality of a future world, the play of my own mind. within me would settle the question. Paul speaks of two natures warring within him, and I have realized it most fully. I started out full of eagerness to succeed, and I put forth every power I possessed to accomplish my purpose. Then was the world uppermost; there was before me present comfort, future independence, the society of friends, the gratification of my worldly desires. The ambition which all active men have, I shared; the triumph of success, merely for the sake of the triumph, played no small part in the motive- power which kept the outer man alive and in activity. Now comes the reactin. The mortal part of my soul, if I may so express myself, is heavy, dull and lethargic, and ambles no faster than a race-horse before an omnibus; yet the other, spiritual, part of me, rebelling against its long imprisonment, is unmindful of bit and curb, and races off. like the wild horse of the prairies. That knows no fatigue. The more it soars, the more it sows, reaps and garners, in the fields of imagination, the stronger it is. It compasses all of Heaven and earth-all, at least, which belongs to the province of the affections-and grows neither faint nor weary under its labors. Were I to draw a distinction, then, of the difference between animals and man, it would be- something   A Phzziosophic Fragment.     197 after this fashion: In our outer nature; which science, for the want of a better term, calls instinct, we share with the brutes. This part of the spirit is a shadow of the higher spiritual; for the most worldly of worldly men-he who has no promptings of a religious character-has a great deal which passes muster for something better; but, if he has never entered into the inner sanctuary of his being, he no more knows the difference between instinct and spirituality than the dog. Of course, with the capacity of rising above the external man, all the other faculties are apt to be keener and quicker than in the brutes; yet have I met with human beings, who, except in the faculty of speech, could hardly be put one whit higher in the scale of animated nature than the horse or the ox. ;Now, this external nature, I verily believe, dies with us. It belongs to the world, and is for use here, and here only. It appertains to worldly science, and the learning of the schools, and will be of no more use to us hereafter than natural food and natural clothing. We must die as to the body, and we must die as, to all which concerns the world. All the sciences by which the outer mind has been cultured, and which have borne the working toils of every-day life, will then be of no more use than the plow, the plane, or the saw, with which men perform their daily labor. But within this outer wheel is another, and within that is the mysterious principle which man can never fathom, for it is God-given; it is the principle of life, a jewel far more difficult to handle, scientifically, than to manufacture a diamond from charcoal. This life is from God, and it is love. I can come no nearer to it than that. When, in true Larmony with the other j      I98    Romance of the Tablc. principles of the human mind, man is filled with wisdom, acting in concert with love, then the outer nature also acts in harmony; and all Lis worldly deeds set forth the fact that, inwardly and outwardly, he is a new being. I fear it is not often we get through the outer shell, and penefrate to the mysteries within us. We are born with a certain amount of inner love and outer wisdom, and we seek to go no further-that is, as a rule; yet there are times, I dare say, when some people die to the world and are born to Heaven; they are let into the secrets of their own being just far enough to enable them to realize the fact of their immortality. Then Heaven becomes a reality, and not a mere matter of faith. "Faith! my darling! I would not give a fig for a faith which is blind, or which has not, at times, the power to open the door of the temple and let me have a glimpse of the mysteries within!

And you are with me in the higher more perfectly than in the lower. Here, in the outer wheel, around which we are naturally whirled, we are husband and wife; there, when we are spiritually joined, we are glorified personalities, with which human titles have nothing in common. We ate two, and yet one; as love and wisdom are two in the mind, yet one in action.

From Memphis he went to Louisville, thence to Cincinnati, to Cleveland, and then home. Home! It was with a palpitating heart that Thomas made his appearance before the door of his house. There was a brightness in his eyes all unwonted, and perhaps a little fever upon his lips, for he had traveled a day and a night without rest. It was still early, and the thunder of daily traffic in the streets had not begun to sound.     200     Romance of the Table. He rang the 'ell lightly, and with some trepidation; he almost feared the sound thereof was a mistake, and might disturb Florence in her rest. "Perhaps I should not have come so early,' reasoned Thomas with him- self; "she may be alarmed, and think there are evil- tidings." But, even as Thomas reasoned,'the door opened. "Rose!" exclaimed Thomas. "Mr. Mayhew!" said Rose, her eyes fairly dancing in her head. "But, hush! mistress--" "She is ill!" cried Thomas, with bated breath, but with anxiety covering his features. "Yes-no-but come-softly," said the maid, lead- ing the way to his wife's chamber. Thomas followed. as though in a dream. Softly Rose opened the door and peeped eagerly in. "Come," said she, a faint smile on her face, but in a whisper. "Mistress is asleep." Thomas did as he was told. There lay Florence- pale, but so beautiful-and there, on her arm, lay her first-born son! -.   CHAPTER X.

Christ, when he uttered those memorable words, "Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them  not, for of such is the kingdom of Heaven," put into words the sentiment of every heart which has within it any of that "innocence of infancy" which allies us with the skies. There are cross children, I know, and bad children; children who cry and fret, and give their parents a great deal of trouble and unhappiness- and, with darkened perceptions, the parents fail to see that, in a majority of instances, they are to blame for all the difficulties under which both parents and children suffer. The true state of a child is one of peace; its normal condition is one ot happiness, not misery; it is the embodied principle of humanity, free from all alloys. As man grows he is apt to mingle base metal with the pure gold, lucky if, in the end, there is aught left of that which in child- hood promised such wealth in the future In infancy only one element of our nature is visible -that of the affections; and Christ had reference to the fact that the controlling sphere of Heaven is love.     202    Romance of the Table. Even the intellect of man, there, is imbued with the Divine nature of the Creator, and he makes it the minister of that love which knows no guile, and can commit no wrong. As the child puts forth its hand to grasp a toy we rejoice to see the inner move- ments of that consciousness which comes from thought; and we rejoice the more as it grows in wis- dom, for each step, each action, is so full of joy. The animation of the child is the outhreak of its happiness. It has not yet thought evil, and the wisdom it begins to display is, as yet, at one with its heart. And then, in the first light of the morning, when the sun peeps through lattice and window, and the bright little eye follows the shadows and grasps with tiny hand at the golden threads which seem to be there expressly for its benefit, what can be more closely allied, than the child to the love within our- selves? We are children ourselves-if we love our children, especially-at such times; and we feel the emotions by which it is actuated, and almost the whisperings of other lands, which seemingly fall with the murmur of the south wind upon its tender ear. '"We have news from Heaven every morning," said Mayhew to his wife, as they watched the smile flitting over the baby's face, and saw its vain efforts to grasp a shadow resting upon the white cover. Florence was silent; her memory was running back-back to her own youthful days. She was abso- lutely trying to remember her own baby-hood. But Thomas was too full of happiness tobe still; and so he snatched the youngster from the crib, and ran dancing round the room like a big school-boy the day before Christmas   AMornina News from Heaven.     203 "Tom!" cried Florence, "you do not know how to handle a baby. Be careful, or you will break its back!" "Or let its head drop off," said Thomas. "Was I not a baby once myself, and don't that give me a perfect knowledge of the race?" "Doubtful," replied his wife; 'and if you were a baby, you did not run capering about the room like that! But what do you remember about your child- hood, Tom? I've been thinking of mine, and I am surprised how many things come to me, now, which I never remembered before." "Yes, no doubt. I can remember when I was almost such a child as Charles Mackay describes- "4 'A little child beneath a tree Sat, and chanted cheerily, A little song, a pleasant song, Which was-she sang it all day long- "When the wind blows the blossoms fall, But a good God reigns over all."' -only I was a boy; but my feelings were the same." "And why is it pleasant to travel back, and think of our childhood, Tom?" "Because, in doing so, we become pure and inno- cent." "Then let us talk with the baby every morning, Tom." "Yes, and ask it for the news from Heaven." "It does unite us with Heaven; does it not, Tom?" "Yes, by the telegraph of love," and Tom kissed his wife, and then the baby. "We will have news from Heaven every morning, Florence!"     CHAPTER XI. NOVEMBER FOURTH, 1857-A CONTEST AND A VICTORY. Why should we Anticipate our sorrows? 'Tis like those Who die for fear of death.-Denham. It is a very old saying, that tCe flag of commerce whitens every sea; and it is equally true that the victims of commerce fill every church-yard and ceme- tery. Of one hundred who engage in commercial pursuits it is estimated that ninety-five fail; and he who can estimate the amount of mental agony, and the positive absorption of brain, body and muscle, of those thus employed in the shadowy pursuit of wealth must have powers of calculation with which ordinary mortals are not gifted. I do not say that commerce is absolutely destructive of religion or morality, but I do say that those who go through the furnace are very apt to be singed. The merchant who toils for nearly a lifetime in the accumulation of wealth acquires habits which ill fit him to enjoy the remainder in any rational way, while too many become hard-hearted and penurious, taking credit to them- selves for their own success, and looking coldly upon those who have failed and fainted by the way-side. There are exceptions-I have given one in Mr. Williams-I wish they were not so rare. I wish the individual toilers upon earth were less individualized, and more a part of the multitude. Take up water from the ocean in your hand, and it will escape in   A Contest and a Victory.    205 drops. Drop, drop, there it goes! but no sooner do the drops fall, separately, than they seek to run togeth- er again; they disappear in the earth, seeking the great reservoirs, or they trickle down a declivity, in search of the great sea. So should it be with man. He, too, belongs to an ocean; but he is ever trying to violate the laws of order and separate himself from his fellow drops. Thence comes weakness, instead of power, and pride and arrogance, and all the vices, failings and foibles of mankind. Even charity often flows-too often- from Individual ostentation. It is pleasant to dis- pense the interest of our money, we keeping the principal quite safe, and to have people look up to us in mute admiration. If Dives had lived in our day he would probably have fed Lazarus bountifully, and had his own name put in the papers. But Dives would not be the less a drop, separated by a gulf from that other drop-Lazarus. And Thomas Mayhew early learned that the path to mercantile success is by no means strewn with roses. We have gone through some of his trials, and shown how he met them.  He came out of the fire, event- ually, burnished gold; but he had the good sense to know that no preliminary trials should discourge, and no temporary success lead to undue confidence ano elation. On his return from the South he addressed himselt at once to his usual routine of business: but he was now admitted into the entire confidence of the firm, with the understanding that, as soon as tie threatening storm was entirely weathered, he was tu have a one-fifth interest in the house. Mr. Turnover was a warm admirer and firm friend or Mayhew, as     206     Romance of the Table. was, indeed, his partner; but Mr. Turnover had a kindly heart, and a sympathizing. He did not appre- ciate Thomas simply because he was a very useful man in the business, but for the many social qualities with which he was gifted. He ack nowledged, at least to himself, that in general acquirements Thomas was his superior-and far superior, in those virtues which adorn the character, to any young man with whom he was acquainted. But the times were very ominous. We frequently know when a storm is coming by atmospheric changes and the electricity in our own system, and there are phenomena in the moral atmosphere which surely indicate an approaching crisis. Men are nervous and restless, and gather in groups, talking in whispers, almost as though the hand of terror rests upon them and they can find no consolation. Some grow gloomy and desponding, and commit suicide; others rush to the bottle, and seek in stimulants to gather courage for emergencies. Ere Thomas arrived home the clouds were gathering fast. Merchants here and there began to fail; some- times they passed away quietly, as a consumptive passes from earth. They were never considered quite strong, and their financial collapses occasioned no surprise. But, now and then, like the crashing thun- der which silences the storm, a house would go down, recognized as among the merchant princes of the nation. Then men would tremble and turn pale, and there would be an uneasy scanning of ledgers and a counting up of assets. Some men are philosophical, and fail in business without much ot a pang; to others it is worse than death. I knew an old man,   A Contest and a Victory.    207 as dignified and courteous as a nobleman. He lived handsomely, and dispensed a noble hospitality. His sons continued the business, and the father left most of his capital therein, and indorsed for them besides. They failed, and he was ruined; but for an annuity settled on his wife he had nothing. House, statuary, pictures, horses, carriages-all went to the auction- block. How much worse could death have been to that man r Then came a day when the electric spark fell among the powder in Wall Street, among the money changers and the banks; and with an ominous swoop came the crowd, as the hawk and the eagle hover over a battle-field. People knew there would be a run upon the banks that very day, and there was How they knew it, by what interior perception of coming evil, cannot be told. I have seen such wonderful tele- graphic flashes through the multitude, often. There is a bond of unity between us, but it takes great events-a great triumph, or a great misfortunez-to develop it. This time the event came in a financial crisis, and the climax was reached in a memorable suspension. It was a melancholy sight, and one which does no credit to human nature-that gloating over the mis- fortunes of the weak, that animal indulgence in a thirst for blood even while the victim lies quivering in its merciless grasp A roar of the hungry multitude rose upon the air as an honored and respected man. his long, gray locks blown streaming with the wind, came out and tried, in feeble voice, to stem the current. The banks would not, should not, stop. They were pledged to each other to sustain their credit to the     208     Romance of the Table. last dollar. Vain effort! futile promise! As well might he have promised that the sun should again stand still, or the moon refuse to give her light! Even as he spoke, men staggering under the weight of gold or silver coin came forth, their steps filled at once by new comers-seekers aftei the same substantial evi- dence of value. And so came the crash and the crisis there, and then men breathed more freely. Nothing worse, seemingly, was in store for the nation than that. The fourth day of November was to be the day of trial to the house of Speedwell & Turnover. It was their heaviest day of payment-the day on which the bulk of their fall notes and acceptances fell due. Could they pass that point safely, all would be well. It was remarked by many, in that year of commer- cial depression and gloom, that the business-people stood by each other more nobly than they had ever done before. It was to the credit of human nature that it should be so, and, at the same time, it was politic. To sustain each other was to sustain the general credit, and make it easier for all to weather the storm. There were many who could not be saved; many whose liabilities were too large, or assets too precarious, to make such support advisable; but there were hundreds of cases in which generosity was of avail, and where assistance was of inestimable value. But with Mayhew's house it was a question of honor, as well as of safety. Thomas had pledged his own reputation, as well as the firm's, and he addressed himself to the work before him with nerves of steel. In after years he looked upon that day with wonder.   At Contest and a Vzclto y.   209 Even Mr. Speedwell, a gentleman ofstrict integrity, but of a more desponding character than either his partner or Mayhew, seriously questioned the ability of the firm to weather the storm. "Do you not think, Thomas," he said to his clerk one day, "that it will be better for us to cease the struggle and give up? We can compromise with our creditors, no doubt, on good terms, and resume business." "With a credit always weak and impaired," replied Thomas. "No  . do not think it best, and it cannot be done with my consent." His lips were compressed, as he said slb, and his eyes grew moist. Mr. Speedwell was thoughtful, but said little. He, perhaps, only intended to try the temper of Mayhew, and he was really filled with pleasure, as he noticed the flash of fire, united with such a depth of feeling. "You know our resources," he continued, "and how to use them. I pray that we may succeed.' It is impossible to narrate how Mayhew met the crisis, for, in reality, the larger share of the burden fell upon his active shoulders. It would be impossible to disclose all the inner workings of a mercantile house, and the various ways by which temporary trouble is avoided, or bridged over, Thomas used his friends as far as he could, in honor Here and there, outside the banks, he got a few notes discounted, and here and there he borrowed only what he was quite positive a few days would enable him to return. Even with all it was, indeed, a close contest between victory and defeat. From early morn, on the fourth of November, until three o'clock the battle raged; but     210     Romance of the Table. Mayhew faltered not, neither was he weary. With the same compressed lips and firm step he persevered to the end; and it was not until the last-named hour, with every note provided for, and less than five dollars balance indthe bank, that he sat down to rest and think. As the wo partners, equally anxious and equally gratified came up to congratulate him, Thomas, for the first ana only time in his life, fainted. Nature had been o-Terstrained, and the reaction was too great. When he came to as he did with the application of a little water to -is temples, Thomas could say but a word- "Let me go .ome o Florence!"   CHAPTER X I  'TIEEZ REUNION OF THE CLUB. To-day is ours, what do we fear? To-day is ours, we have it here; Let's treat it kindly, that it may Wish, at least, with us to stay; Let's banish business, banish sorrow- To the Gods belongs to-morrow.- Cowleq. I pass over most ot the minor events which tol- lowed the crash of r857. That was a seeming intro- duction to the grand yet terrible drama which was to open a few years later, before which all merely com- mercial whirlwinds became mere sighing breezes from the tropics. Nay, Thomas came home from the South with an impression not easily defined, yet not to be dismissed, that there were evil days in store for the Republic, and that it was desirable to watch both the political and financial barometers in the future. As he expressed it, the Southern air was filled with elec- tricity; there was an under-tow which carried people off their feet, even while the surface was smooth and tranquil. The dominant Southern feeling was one of antagonism to the North; and, like a strong tide, it was to be feared both in its flow and its ebb. The gulf once bridged, the firm of Speedwell & Turnover began that course of action which enabled them to provide against like contingencies in the future, as well as to repay the indebtedness of the past. The chief solicitude of Thomas was, of course, in the latter direction. He desired to demonstrate to his friends the sacredness of his promises, as well as     212    Romance of the Table. the correctness of his judgment; and, to the doubtful, the possibility of success without the favors which he had asked and they had refused. The next thing, thought he, to "winning golden opinions from all sorts of men," is to force all sorts of men to respect you.  Little by little, then, the firm gathered together their resources, and, as they did so, they repaid their loans and strengthened their position. They were careful, toor ii the further extension of credits, and sought to curtail rather than to increase their business. There are few years of commercial disaster so remarkable by kindly efforts of merchants to sustain each other as marked the period of which I have written. Failures, of course, were inevitable; but even those who were forced to succumb were kindly dealt with, and assisted to resume, if possible, or to close up their affairs with the least loss to themselves. Having their business once again within their own control-that is, so that they could carry it on with their own capital-the firm performed an act of simple justice to the man to whose exertions and intrepidity they were so much indebted. And this was accom- plished, too, in a way most in harmony with May- hew's feelings. He was not patronized: he was not made to feel the goodness of his employers through laudatory addresses, nor that his proposed elevation was a reward of merit, such as a school-boy may win by an extra effort of memory, or of labor On going to his desk, one morning, Thomas found a large envelope addressed to him. He opened it, with some curiosity, and found it to contain all the necessary papers making him a partner in the firm, with an   The Reunzion of the Clzb.    213 interest of twenty per cent and a yearly allowance of double the amount of his salary. There was a short note from the firm, expressing their obligations and asking him to sign the papers, if approved by him. The wish was also expressed that Thomas should spare himself any formal acknowledgments, but, if it would be agreeable to him, Mr. Speedwell and Mr. Turnover would pass the next evening at his house. Thomas felt very deeply the altered position of his affairs, yet there was much less elation than might have been expected. There came upon him that sense of responsibility, which, next to an absolute struggle for existence, is apt to make us serious. Thomas, too, had passed through the fire of trial, he knew what it was to have the chalice of hope pressed to the lips, and to have it rudely shaken while yet quaffing. If the present was promising, the long vista of the future had in store, perchance, many a storm and pitfall- many an ambuscade of foes. While such thoughts took possession of his mind for a moment, and he held his throbbing brow in his hand, there came other visions, with hues from Par. adise; and, if angels do attend us, and have wings, which I very much doubt. Thomas certainly felt that :he air was stirred by them at that very moment. His Yye grew bright his head ceased throbbing his houghts began to weave poetic fancies, and his rips to "um familiar tunes, and such as his wife loved; Somebody once wrote a long and learned work on nediums, a profound dissertation on the necessity- nd thence tor the extstence-of intermediates between ourselves and the Divine. It was argued that, as we ould not bear the rays ot the sun unless they were     214     Romance of the Table. tempered by atmospheres, so God's love must reach us modified by the intermediation of purer beings than ourselves, Thomas thought of this theory, as he stood there by his desk; and as the light came to his face and the brightness to his eyes, the great round tears dimmed them and fell- -plash, plash-upon the portentous legal documents which were as yet unread Yes, there came Heaven's comfort through her. The very moment Florence rose before him-and Florence, too, with a child, his child, upon her breast-the interrupted communication with Heaven was restored, and a flood of harmony stole into his heart. What would Florence think, and what would Flor- ence say'? He knew, well enough, without asking. He heard her voice in fond questionings, and he made his replies, even as he stood there; and, indeed, there is no knowing how long he would have remained absent-minded from business, but present-minded at home, but for the entrance of one of the junior clerks, demanding his attention to sublunary affairs. As in a great mill the harsh creaking of the ponder- ous wheel comes before the machinery is set in motion, so there came the rude jar to Thomas, with the information that there is an earth to work in. as well as a Heaven to live in. There was but little said in regard to the partner- ship between Thomas and his former employers; there was more of feeling conveyed between them in the grasp of the hand than in the words which were spoken. Thomas found that a desk had been provid- ed for him in the private office, and that one of the other clerks had been promoted to his former posi- * t . ..   The Reunion of the Club.    215 tion. His sphere of operations was clearly defined, and sufficiently laborious to suit his active tem- perament. And there was no difficulty, familiar as he was with every department of the business, in at once dropping easily and naturally into his new position. He was to be the corresponding partner, too, and that suited him-for Thomas had a singular love of composition, and there was no department of literature for which he had not a fondness. even to the ordinary letters on business, which he often adorned by quaint, though apt expressions, as well as by clear- ness of style But Thomas pit the greatest curb on his inclina- tion, that day, ot which I, his historian, have any record. He sent a boy to say to Florence that he should not be home until an hour after the usual time. You, reader, if in his place, would have made some excuse, anc gone home in the middle of the day. I knowyou would. You would have embraced your wife and kissed the baby, and rtanced around the room like a crazy man, and then you would have pulled out the papers and made a great flourish of trumpets over your new position and future pros- pects. A position in a house having two hundred thousand dollars capital, and doing a business of half a million, was enough to upset any man's brain, tem- porarily, and neither you nor I could resist the temp- tation I have referred to. But Thomas resisted, and he reasoned with himself thus sensibly:. "Let me do my first day's work well and thoroughly-let me temper my own impatience by an abnegation of self. When I do go home I shall be free, no thought resting upon may mind which     216     Romance of /he Table. shall stand between me and happiness, when I have turned my back upon business When Thomas did reach home he was amply re- warded for his trial of patience He was just in the mood, too, for enjovment. Sobered down by his day's toil, he saw that his new position brought with it cares and responsibilities to which he had been in some measure a stranger, and which demanded serious thoughts and grave reflections, rather than the reverse. Still, in the buoyancy ot youth and health, we meet lifes duties with cheerfulness; and Thomas never brought clouds home, if there was a ray of sunshine to be borrowed from the sky Florence knew, as soon as she saw hei husband's face, that something new had occured, and she saw, also, that there was something pleasant to hear; but she, too, had fallen into Mayhew's way of waiting. She presided, therefore, at her little table with more than her usual vivacity-telling Thomas the wonderful doings of Thomas Jr., and the events and incidents of the day. Then. when the cloth was removed, and she and her husband sat alone on the sofa by the fire-for the evening was chilly-she took Thomas' face be- tween her hands. and, kissing him, said "Now, dear, tell me all about it!" And Thomas told hei all, in his own quiet, pleasant way, and the couple discussed the business and the future, as sensible people should, with many pleasant anticipations and some wise resolutions They would live just as they were doing then-keeping a strict watch over their expenses, as they had done, yet living without meanness, and entertaining their friends, as they had been wont to do in the pas.   The Reunion of the Club.    217 "And this will be a good time to reorganize the Club," said Thomas. 'I think we had a great many pleasant evenings, last winter: do you not think so, Florence?" "Indeed I do, and useful; and the entire expense was not so great as people often incur for a single opera ticket." "Dr. Sollinger will not leave the city," said Thomas, "until next spring; so we can have him again." "Yes, and 1 am very curious to understand his theory of life and health," replied Florence. "I have heard so many wonderful stories that it would be pleas- ant to know the foundation on which they are built." "He is an. oddity," said Mayhew. "He does what no one else can, he can do what he cannot teach others to do. His theory seems to me rational, so far as I understand it, and his practice, so far, has sus- tained the theory" "We must have them all in,rto-morrow night,"then, continued Florence. 'Mr. Williams, especially-the dear, good'soul! How glad he will be to hear of your present position, and to reflect that he has been instrumental in bringing it about!" "Do you remember what I wrote you, from Rich- mond, about the merchant who called upon me at the hotel, and bought the cloth of me?" "Yes, I remember." "Well, that incident puzzled me not a little. I could not rest until I knew how that man knew me. Light came to me. one day, and I made up my mind that Mr. Williams was at the bottom of it. I may be wrong, but I do'not think I am; and I think I will test the matter to-morrow night."     2I8     Romance of the Table. "Yes," said Florence, "you can ask him whether he has heard from his Richmond friend, lately."' "I can never thank Mr. Williams enough for his ,kindness," said Mayhew. "That little adventure put life into me for the whole trip. People sometimes think that giving or lending money is the ultimation of charity; but, in reality, a little encouragement is often of more value than cash." So the arrangements were made, the invitations given, and the Club met, as had been agreed upon. And a right merry reunion it turned out to be. The firm were there, and Mr. Williams, Dr. Sollinger, the Professor, Vohlen, the bachelor, Mayhew's father and mother, Florence's family, and a few more of such relations and friends as the couple thought would enter into the spirit of the occasion. The new head clerk was invited, too-" and, in fact," said Florence, laughing, "it is just no club at all-but a fashionable soiree. But, Tom, if we were to ask all who love you, and all who would Ke happy to congratulate you and wish you all manner of joy, the house would not contain them all." "I wish I might think so," said Tom.   CHAPTER     XIII. "ALL THE WOR'LD AT DINNER."

"Iow pleasant it would be," said Thomas, when the company again met, "to drop into dinner with all the world-quite unexpectedly, of course, taking them all in turn-Christian, Pagan, Infidel and Jew!" "You would have a good time, if your appetite was equal to all emergencies," replied Vohlen; "but my opinion is, you would be glad to get home to a sensi- ble beefsteak." "People who travel much,' said the Professor, "should have strong stomachs and nerves, and a large amount of philosophy. The English are grumblers, simply because they are so deficient in the requisites I have named." "I should be a mighty poor traveler," chimed in Dr. Sollinger; "for where should I get my potato?" "Where, indeed!" said Dr. Lorton. "What would become of you in China, where the rich will not eat the potato because poor people do?" "I should board with the poor," replied Dr. Sollin- ger; "and then I should try to teach the rich better OA     220     Romance of the Table manners. But I think I might get along in China better than you think. Do they eat many kinds of vegetables?" "The principal diet of the people at large," said Dr Lorton, "consists of rice, and fish-when they can afford it. They have, however, as great a variety as we have, almost. They raise sweet potatoes, barley, beans, wheat, and they make a kind of cake from the seeds of the Sorghum, which, in Chinese, is called Kauliang They have fruits, too; but, with unacounta- ble silliness, they pick them when green, which impairs their flavor. Oranges, plums and peaches are plenti- ful. In one part of China they never eat bread at their meals. As to meats, as everybody knows the story of roast pig told by Charles Lamb, it will be at once surmised that they are pork-eaters; but they use neither veal nor mutton; nor is meat salted by the celestial. They have Chinese beef, a kind of buffalo, and they indulge in the flesh of goats." "Do tell us," said Florence, "how the Chinese use chop-sticks 1' "It is a common idea," replied the Doctor, "that the chop-sticks are used separately; but this is an error. The Chinaman holds his bowl of rice in his left hand, near his mouth, and his two sticks in his right, and he throws the compound between his lips by a movement which it requires some practice to imitate. An earthern spoon is used to dip up gravy and liquids. The eater, when vegetables, meat, etc., are on the 'oard, helps himself with his chop-sticks. They have knives and forks, but they are employed for other uses than those of the table."   All the World at Dinner.     221 "I hear that the women hold a degraded position in China; is that so?" demanded Florence. "Yes; I should think so. Women have no souls, there-' It is supposed they have none here, to speak of,' interrupted Vohlen "When you are married," replied Florence, "you will find they have tongues, if you talk in that way.' ' At table," continued the Doctor "the family sit together, provided no strangers are present; if that is the case, the sexes eat by themselves. Gentlemen are not introduced to ladies; but the latter, on festive occasions, are put in an apartment by themselves." "There is a French joke,' said Thomas, "to the effect that all the tea raised in China goes abroad, and that the Chinese themselves drink French brandy; but, of course, there is no truth in it." "No; quite the reverse. Tea is the grand essential of life to the poorest, and many would prefer suffering a long while from thirst to drinking cold water. I believe they never use green tea, that being prepared expressly to suit a foreign taste. Neither do they drink their black tea strong. Milk and sugar are not in use. They pour boiling water on the tea, let it stand a few minutes, and then drink it hot. It is N mark of politeness to offer tea to strangers. But all this has little to do with dinner. although, as tea is the universal standing beverage at all meals, it is well enough to bring it in,' 'Do they drink ardent spirits, or wine?" asked Vohlen. Yes; they have a distillation they call samnshu. They make it from rice, and sometimes, I am told,     2^3     Romance of the Table. from potatoes, beans, and the sugar-cane. When they have a jollification they heat their wine. But, in regard to eating, it is a good deal there as here. The dinner is meager or plentiful, according to the purse of the eater, ox of the host; only, with the wealthy, the variety is made up of such singular compounds as I    would puzzle a French cook: strange soups, fricas- sees, stews, etc., in an endless number of courses, until the senses are wearied and the stomach disgusted. On the whole, after a month of Chinese fashionable dinners, I think 1 should be satisfied to adopt Dr. Sollinger's potato diet ' "' Well, even China fare is better than the Arabic," said Mayhew. "I have read, somewhere, that an Arab's favorite dish is meat, boiled and seethed in a little water and its own grease, until about half done. They have a queer dish, too, of some kind of grain, which looks like -red paini and Graham flour; but what it is I do not remember Soitte of the Arabs have queer ideas about the use of bread, 'which they only use at one meal-breakfast. They are great fellows for dates, too-these Arabs-and coffee. "In Egypt and Turkey," said the Professor, "'they eat a good deal of soup made- of mutton, with plenty of vermicelli. They mix rice with pototoes. Mutton is principally boiled, and they have very little beef, and no veal The y scoop out the tomato, anc fill it with chopped mutton and boiled rice.

Coffee is drunk out ot very small China cups, very much like e(g-cups.'   All the World at Dzinner.    223 "As we come nearer to what we call civilization," said Mr. Williams, who had hitherto been only a listener, "we find advances toward a higher kind of art in cooking; yet in many countries we still experience difficulties. We would expect to find in Spain as good a table as in France and Germany; yet such is not the case-at least, it does not suit an American appetite so well. Then, their taste and customs seem to be allied to the Arabic, as they make a great variety of stews-the contents of which no one but the cook knows. An 'olla' is a dish of vegetables and meat, much in favor; but, if a man wishes to go through Spain and come out a philosopher he should never go into the kitchen, nor ask questions of the waiter. A very good dinner can be had in the large cities, but the ordinary country Posada is decidedly a place of entertainment for man and beast-only the beast should stand first, he being of the most importance. "Garlic is extensively used, and a favorite dish is compounded of bread, cucumbers, oil, vinegar and garlic. I believe they call it gaspacho. In some places they rub the meat with garlic before cooking. In Cuba, where they adhere more strongly to old Spanish customs than they even do in Spain, I could find nothing but bread and eggs free from that pungent flavor. "But, what is very singular, Spain, which furnishes the world with certain kinds of wine, is one of the most temperate countries in the world--even if she does not carry off the palm from all others. Never were a people so fond of water. They christen it with fancy names, according to its supposed qualities; and they make a most refreshing drink of a light,     224     Romance of the Table. puffy preparation of sugar and the white of eggs. These cakes, which are about twice the size of the tumbler in which they are put, slowly dissolve, and the product-a rich, sweet beverage-is the standard drink. The name is Azucarilla. The Spaniards drink little tea or coffee; the latter is served in little cups, after dinner, for those who wish it, after the manner of other countries. Meat is generally overdone, and pudding and pies are uriknown. I suppose many Spaniards would be as much puzzled over our pastry as we are over their olias. Dessert consists of jellies, preserves, cakes, confectionery and cheese. I ought to have added that stewed partridges are as standard a dish as the roast beef of old England." "Oh! Mr. Williams," exclaimed Florence; 'I did not know you had been a traveler, and I should so like to hear more. Do the Portuguese differ much from the Spaniards?" "Yes, and no. There is a great difference between them, yet many points of similarity. I think they live better in Portugal than in Spain; at least, I found it so. They have a great variety of fish, as may be sup- posed, from their proximity to the sea and the amphibious nature of the people. They have soles, turbot, flounders, and many fish we are not familiar with. The delicious little sardine is also common, they fry it in oil.

Of course, you will not be surprised to hear that tobacco is extensively used, and the cigar, or cigarette, is hardly ever out of the lips, except to put something else between them. But I have talked enough. I was never in Germany, where, I under- stand, Dr. Lorton lived for some years. Tell-us, Doctor, how you enjoyed life there." "k Germany," said the Doctor, " is pretty well known to Americans, now  I found it nearer home, the language excepted, than any other foreign country. There is an open frankness among the people which is very pleasing. In some respects they are superior to any other people. They reverence age, and they are always kind and courteous to each other Strangers do not pass without a kindly salutation, and there is always a readiness to assist and befriend each other, which is very gratifying. There is poverty there, as elsewhere, but less than in many other countries; and I doubt whether farm labor is better paid anywhere. This is shown in the fact that all the German emi- grants have money, and the aggregate added to our wealth each year from that source is considerable. The farms are cut up very small, but are very highly cultivated. Cattle are not pastured. Cows do the work of oxen with us, and the latter are stall-fed and fattened for the market. The science of living and economizing is nowhere more perfectly understood. "The style of living is between our own and the French The table d'hote is regularly established in all hotels, and no people are so fond of dining together as the Germans. They are decidedly gregarious. Their beer-gardens are resorted to for company, and beer and tobacco are but a help to other social pleasures. 13     226     Romance of the Table. "The German dinner-table, in a first-class house, is quite an elaborate affair. The courses are numerous, and each dish is put upon the table, and then removed and carved. This is a guarantee that the meats are prepared expressly for the occasion; besides this, the cook takes a justifiable pride in his art, and frequently adorns his dishes quite artistically French and Ger- man wines are common, but are not free, as are clarets in Paris. In the latter city, the guests never see the meats before carving, but only as, in a dissected state, they are handed round. "The difference between Germany, France, and the United States, in respect to dining, is one of style, rather than quality Here the guest runs over a sumptuous Dill of fare, and selects the dinner he wishes to eat, and it is brought to him. Abroad, he sits still, and waits for the dishes to be passed round. If there are fifteen varieties they are all passed in review before him, and he takes, or passes, as he may please. The latter plan has the advantage of enabling one to see how the dish looks, and to select such a piece as we fancy. "The restaurant, in Paris, is largely managed in the same way. There is no carte, or bill of fare; but the dishes are passed in rotation. First stating whether we wish a full bottle of ardinaire wine, or a- half of superieure, we have nothing to do but to eat our way through, from the soup to the fruit.

A large joint of any kind Is utterly foreign to the French taste, and their ovens are poorly adapted to roasting anything large or substantial. They are great in fricassees of veal, in vol au vents and mysterious com- binations; and, while there may be more than enough to satisfy the appetite, there is nothing to fill the body with anything truly substantial by itself. In fact, outside of England and our own country the sirloin of beef and the quarter of mutton are almost un- known. The character of a people may as well be looked .for in its table as in art or inventions. I agree, most freely, with Dr Sollinger, that such a variety as is offered in any civilized country arises from no necessity, but is the result of appetites arti- ficially stimulated and artistically administered unto." 'And the Doctor is quite right,' said Mr. Williams. "If we allow that meat is an absolute necessity, how do we get around the fact that in many countries- Norway, Iceland, Scotland, Ireland, etc.-the people are so hardy living almost without it .

"What will become of us, if we let science go by the board in that way?" "But how are you to get around the facts?" "By denying them, I presume; or, if not that, by demonstrating that John Bull, with less meat, would be quite as strong, and a great deal cleverer man will not discuss it now, however; so go ahead.' "Dinner is the great meal in England,' continued Dr. Lorton, a and to dine there is to have mild visions of apoplexy before our eyes.

Of course, where there is company, and ladies are present, the latter rise at the end of the dinner and return to the drawing- room, leaving the gentlemen to their wine and cigars. If they are social fellows, of course, they do not go to sleep, but the tendency ot such an enormous con- sumption of heavy food is, of course, toward lethargy and sleep Still, I contend that an Englishman with- out his roast would not be an Englishman." "Does his roast involve port and sherry?" asked Dr. Sollinger "Seemingly so. A man can drink more, with impunity, there, than here. The amount an English- man swallows is enormous; yet drunkenness is very rare among the well-bred. The lower classes fire their blood with gin, and intemperance is very preva- lent. But the climate of England permits more indulgence than elsewhere. The wine and the beef are burnt up in the system, and that very rapidly. So we see what makes John Bull so hasty, petulant, and irascible, he is always suffering from, an excess of carbon." "We have not named over all the world," said Mr. Williams, " and have not touched the fair land of Italy, where I found somethings to surprise me.' 'What were they?" asked Florence, inquiringly. "Trifles,' replied that gentleman. "I had heard so much of Frenchmen being frog-eaters that I was astonished to find them altogether outdone by the Italians, frogs, cleaned and ready for cooking, being one of the regular market supplies.

I don't know anything a dog will eat from which the poor of an Italian city will turn away. 'But, Dr. Sollinger," continued Mr Williams, "I have heard so much of you, and your system of treat- ment, that I desire to hear more, and from yourself, if you have no objection-and with the consent of our kind host and hostess." "And," said Florence, "I put a veto on the Doctor to-night, for ' know it will be interesting enough to devote an entire evening to his exposition, and, besides, I intend to invite a room full, and give the Doctor a chance to convert all Will it suit you to postpone the subject until next evening, Mr. Wil- liawns?" '"With all my heart,' said he. "I shall be happy to bring Mrs. W., also, who is somewhat of an invalid." "Let us adjourn to the drawing-room, then," said Vohlen, 'and have a concert a la Russe." "If you would oblige me, however, ' said the Doctor, as they rose to go to the parlor, "I would like our bachelor friend, here, to give us that little story he has been writing, at our 'next soiree. We have had a great deal of meat; let us have a little dessert, before we sit down to my dinner of potatoes." "I am under the orders of the Queen," replied the bachelor, looking at Florence. "Well, then, the Queen commands--' "And I obey.' said the bachelor.     CHAPTER     X1V. VOHLEN' S TORY., HALF-PAST SIX, SHARP. Samuel Buffer, Esq., was a manufacturer of silks, in Nottingham, England, and his father, who died of apoplexy at sixty-six, had established the business and left it to his son-as good a chip of the old block as it is easy to find. Buffer was a perfect pattern of those bluff, hearty, red-faced old fellows, so frequently met with in England, weighing eighteen stone, at least, and as solid as a sirloin of English beef. For forty years Buffer had walked from his house to the mill, and from the mill to the house, until, it was asserted, he had worn a gutter in the sidewalk with the tramp of his heavy shoes. So regular was he, in truth, that the good housewives on the road who were too poor to own clocks regulated their diurnal motions by Buffer's movements. "There comes Buffer-it is half-past eight!" or, "There goes Buffer to lunch; it is half-past twelve!" and half-past five brought Buffer to the street again, as. surely as the great hand of the town-clock pointed to that hour on the dial. There were few more exemplary Christians than Samuel Buffer. He prided himself on owing no man anything, and he did not intend any man should owe him. "All i want, sir"-Buffer was in the habit of   Half-past Six, Sharp.     233 saying-" all I want, sir, is justice. I pay everybody to the last penny, and have I not the right to ask the same?" 'But, Mr. Buffer," said a blue and white looking man, one day, "I have been unfortunate. I indorsed a note for a friend, who died, and I had to take the note up. Then, I have been sick myself, and have lost a child with the fever." *' Stuff and nonsense!" replied Mr. Buffer; "look at me! I never indorse for any man; you don't catch me in that trap. And what have I got to do with your family matters? Poor folks who have more children than they can provide for are very apt to lose them. All I want, sir, is my money. You have no right to ask me to pay your notes, or support your family. Good morning, Mr. Pline-remember, the money at twelve, sharp, to-morrow, or in goes the sheriff." And Buffer's method of dealing with his workmen and workwomen was precisely similar He could take a piece of silk between his fat fingers and tell its value with his eyes shuts and if a piece of goods was brought him fresh from the loom, and it varied P hair-breadth from tthe stipulation, woe to that work- man  "Make out this man's account, Mr. Nagem,' he said, sternly, to his accountant XVe must teach him  that what we pay for we must nave-and deduct a penny a yard. Mr Nagem The exactness of Mr. Buffer's dealings with his fellow-men will be plain from these examples, and he stood, in his own esteem, as a monument of British justice. "Don't owe any man, and don't allow any     234     Romance of the Table. man to owe you T"-that was his every-day religion. "Let any workman come into my room after the bell has rung! There was that weak-kneed, white-faced chap, Smithson-a sober fellow enough, and a good workman; bjut one morning he was late. Rules are rules,' said I; 'make out his account, Mr. Nagem! "Smithson was impudent enough to say that his wife was ill, and that he had a large family to support, and begged I would overlook his failure. No, you don't, said I. 'What have I got to do with your family? And what business has a poor, sickly fellow like you to have a family you can't support? Make out his account, Mr. Nagem!"' It is hardly necessary for me to say that Buffer was an earnest supporter of Church and State. The two were so inseparable, in his mind, that a division would have been as fatal to both as the separation of the head from the body would be fatal to life. The State was the Church, and the Church was the State. Dissenters and Infidels were put in the same box, and he had charity fo. neither; but, instead thereof, the most sovereign contempt. Buffer was regular in his attendance at church- nevel in the evening, for that interfered with his dinner, but in the morning his responses were as sonorous as a trumpet. We pray thee, good Lord," coming out with a snap, as though his utterance of it settled the petition henceforth and forever. At table Buffer always said grace, and it was said after this fashion: ' Lor make-us-thankful-for-what-bout-re- ceive-Amen-take soup?"-the last words addressed, of course, to the guest at his right hand   Half-past Six, Sharp.     235 And Buffer had a good many guests at dinner. He rather liked it; and he never had a customer within reach-a prompt, paying one, at least-whom he did not invite to dine. He was fond of the table, and spent the most of his evenings there. He was proud of his solid silver service, and he was especially proud of his port. Flanking a huge sirloin of beef, or a saddle of South-Down mutton, with port on one side and sherry on the other, his red face shining above like a light-house, Mr. Samuel Buffer looked not only like the embodiment of British justice,.but of British beef, as well; and, as it is a physiological fact that an ox is but a concentration of some tons of vegetable matter, so it was not difficult to imagine that Mr. Buffer represented several oxen, a few hundred sheep, and a hogshead or two of old port. "That's the drink for me!" he would say, to an admir- ing guest. "Ale with your lunch, port with your dinner Champagne  Pooh, slops! What do them Parley-vous know about living? Water soups, chops, fricassees, sweets, and claret! Faugh'! See what kind of people they are. The men wear corsets, and the women would not be visible without being padded and painted! Eat frogs, too, and drink sugar- water-the boobies!" From this it is evident that Mr Buffer had the national antipathy to France, and that Frenchmen were his particular aversion. It will also be surmised that, with such eminently British views of his neigh- bor, his home table arrangements were as near the, French antipodes as it was possible to  make them This was his general bill of fare:     236     Romance of the Table.

"Puddings and pastry, for those who like them," said Mr. Buffer; "I don't." SIXTH COURSE. Stilton cheese, with bread and butter. SEVENTH COURSE. Fruits in season. Filberts and English walnuts. PERPETUAL COURSE. Port and sherry. And a steady, portly waiter, with a sharp eye for an empty glass, kept the decanters moving lively. "That port, sir, said Mr. Buffer, looking at the purple fluid with an eye of affection; "that port I bottled myself, in I855.

John, take the key and bring a bottle of i85o.' John brings the bottle, and Mr. Buffer goes off into a panegyric on the beauties of the English table, and the benefits of solid eating and drinking, the virtues of port being uppermost "See what a healthy people we are!' said Mr. Buffer, "temperate, steady, and happy. Strong, too -look at me: eighteen stone, and constitution like an elephant!" Buffer despised drunkenness, and topers generally, He looked upon a steady head as a necessity of life, and a bottle of port or sherry, and a stiff glass of hot whisky, before going to bed, as being English, temperate, and wholesome At ten o'clock Buffer always felt a little peckish, and with his elegant dining-room, a cosy fire, and the con- comitants of the table, an hour slipped away very easily. "Only a bit of pork-pie or a deviled kidney-that is all,' said Buffer. "Take a pickle? Pass the mustard, John, and fill up the gentleman's glass. Another bit of pork-pie? No Why, you are eating nothing! Here, John, pass the pickles There are sardines, if you like them-I don't." After this light supper the whisky came on, and the hot water the sugax and the lemons "This is the way we live Ir England," said Buffer; "sensible and comfortable That whisky won't give you a headache -not if you drink a dozen bottles- Lochnigar, twenty years old, it a day. Nothing like regular habits. When I say half-past six, sharp, [ mean half- past six, sharp, and I never wait for anybody."     238    Romance of the Table. It was after one of these comfortable family dinners and suppers, about the hour of four A. M., when the world generally sleeps the soundest, that the Buffer family were aroused from the land of dreams, and called, with an imperative demand, to the bed-chamber of Mr. Buffer. There was Mrs. Buffer, white with fright, and there were the servants, hurrying to and fro with eyes staring wildly-stumbling over each other on the stairs, too, and in the halls-all crazy with fear, and uneerfiin what to do; talking, whispering, advising; some-running for hartshorn, and bringing water, and one dispatched for camphor, bringing-port. Then, after a dreary half-hour of waiting, during which the sounds of convulsive breathing from the chamber struck a chill of dire foreboding to every heart, the coachman came with the family doctor, and then the truth came out: Mr. Buffer was laboring under a stroke of apoplexy; and, in a very short time there- after, eighteen stone of solid, healthy English flesh lay quietly enough-for there was no soul within to animate it. The Doctor took a pinch of snuff, as he walked into the hall and looked at the big round face of the English clock. It was half-past six, sharp!   CHAPTER XV. DR. SOLLINGER GIVES THE SECRET OF LIFE AND HEALTH. "There," said he, " is the man who has fought more battles, sai more good things, and taken less physic, than any Emperor that over wore the diadem."- Croly. It was early in December, in the year I857, that the familiar faces once more- met around the table. and before the cheerful fire. It had not been determined to meet in regular sessions, as had been the practice the previous winter : The cares of housekeeping had increased upon Florence, and the general duties of life upon Thomas. So, for the present, at least, it was decided that the Club should come together just as it might, from time to time, be agreed upon; always to suit the convenience of the host and hostess, and always with some definite end in view, or some sub- ject to discuss. There was, however, as we have learned from a previous chapter, a desire to hear more in regard to Dr. Sollinger's theory of disease and its treatment, and it was determined to devote one long evening to him, and another to the discussion of the subject, or such inquiries as those interested might feel free to make.  There were qo   invalids at this particular gathering; a few with ordinary weaknesses-in throat, digestion or bile; a sick-headache patient; several subject to colds with the changes of the weather, and one or two with rheumatic -twinge;--that is all. We     240    Romance of the Table. are so subject to these minor complaints that we hardly think, even, how nice it would be to have none at all, So, curiosity had drawn the friends together, more than necessity All telt that sickness might come on any day, and the duty of being prepared and there is no subject which attracts such universal attention as that of health. Disease has given all the nostrum- venders fortunes. and it supports in comfort and afflu- ence many thousands of professional and educated practitioners But here was a novelty: a plain, unpolished, self- educated countryman, who had weighed all the great medical lights of the age in the scales and found them wanting, and who had drawn upon Nature both for his knowledge of disease and the remedies therefor. It is difficult to present the Doctor's method of teach- ing and illustration. He had his own way, his own style. Quaint, he was colloquial, rather than didac- tic. He asked a great many questions, and often made his company answer to their nwn discomfiture. Partly in his style and partly in my own, I shall endeavor to set forth the Doctor's theory He believed, in regard to other medical theories, that simplicity was very much clouded by science. A hurt little finger does not need a knowledge of the fact that the injury lies in the flexor brevis minimi digizi to make a plaster more efficacious. An Indian can mend a broken bone with no knowledge of sur- gery, and the pennyroyal tea of our grandmothers ,assisted in some remarkable cures without a Latin prescription ot a map of the human stomach. With- out, however, denying the advantages of a high scien-   The Secret of Life and Health.   24I tific knowledge in' many difficult cases, the Doctor simply argued that, generally, in either acute or chronic diseases, Nature is the great physician; and to be versed in her laws is the most essential part of educa- tion "Where shall we begin to study Nature?" inquired Mr. Williams. "In childhood," replied Dr. Sollinger. "What does Nature absolutely require? Air, heat and light-the same as for a plant, only tempered to the weakness and delicacy of infancy-and nourishment. Many can remember the barbarous doses of a less enlightened age; the tight and oppressive bandages, and the total exclusion of a healthy atmosphere: the delicacy which often followed, the liability to colds and inflammations; the frequent visits of the physician, and the weak, puny bodies which too often grew up to suffer, when they should have reveled in life and happiness. "Now, a baby needs to be let alone. It does not ask for improper food and medicine, but proper food wit/wou medicine. It does not demand a stifling atmosphere and weak lungs, but an atmosphere which Nature has' provided, as well for babies as for men. "As we grow up, the requisities of healthy life are modified, not changed We can enjoy more, and must have more to enjoy-more light, more air, more food. If we are living in a variable climate we must gradually accustom ourselves to the changes from heat to cold, but without unnatural exposure, which Nature never teaches. Here comes in the use of rationality- not science. Science does not teach us to refrain from running, half-clothed, from a hot room to the cold or 16 AK . 5 'S      242     Romance of the Table. damp open air, but what we call commnon sense. If a delicate woman jumps from a warm bed and thrusts her head out of a window, and remains there long enough to take a severe cold, which, in its turn, run- ning into a consumption, causes death, in my opinion Providenc6 has very little to do with the result, but a violation of providential laws, and our rationality, very much. "Very well; if the best way to secure health is to follow Nature's teaching, it certainly must result that we can as safely follow her lead in endeavoring to restore that which we have lost. The first thing is to travel backward, as men are forced to do when they have taken a wrong road. Let me say, for instance, that a man is bilious, or thinks he is. He has yellow eyes, a bad tongue, a dizziness of the head, and is generally 'out of sorts.' What is your remedy, Dr. Lorton?" "You have me there," said Dr. Lorton, laughingly. "My science would not allow me to say-without a scientific diagnosis. A seltzer powder, a pill, an emetic; or nothing at all, perhaps."  v "There you are," resumed Dr. Sollinger; "common sense is put at the tail, instead of the head. Nothingc at all is the medicine; but even that should be taken with judgment. My remedy is rest, and a fast. Some tell me, 'O yes, I believe in fasting, but I can't stop work;' or, I have eaten very little-only a little meat for dinner, with a potato; and a cup of tea and a bit of toast iq the evening.' When'l say fast, I mean fast' and I mean repose of mind and body, also. "Repose! There is the door wide open to health and longevity. The poet calls sleep 'tired Nature's sweet   The Secret of Life and tHealth.   243 restorer ;' and the- poet was right-only he should have extended his view to other restoratives of the mind than the sleep of the body. The moment the steam- engine breaks, even the smallest screw, we stop to repair.; why should we not do so with the body? Half our ailments would be within easy control if we did so--if we rested for repairs. But no; it is easier to take a little medicine, and work on, than to stop. "The first question to ask ourselves, in all ordinary ases of illness, is: What law of Nature has been violated? We may find, for instance, that bathing has been neglected; that the skin is dry and feverish, the pores closed, and the surface harsh. Open the pores, cleanse the skin. Nature, through her million of mouths, is exhaling carbonic acid gas, and, with it, a great deal of effete matter. If this healthy function is arrested, disorder is the immediate result. What then?-restore the function. What common sense is there in giving medicine for a fever, when the cause of fever-that which feeds the flame-still exists in the system?   We put out a fire by putting on water, not by a dose of oil, or of calomel; why should the fire in the system be treated much differently? What we need, as I have said, is to know what law of Nature has been violated; which of the wheels in her mechan- ism has been arrested, and set it going again. The human system is different from a house on fire, in this: We put out the fire to prevent its extension to other houses, without caring for the condition of that in which it originated; but we must cure the body, if possible, and still leave it whole. If killing the patient was the proper thing to do, it would be an easy matter."     244    Romance of the Table.  "Killing the patient is the scientific plan, is it not, Dr. Lorton?" said the bachelor. "Science will not deign to reply," returned the Doctor. "Well, I know Science tried very hard to kill me, when I was a boy," argued the bachelor. "I never had a cold or an ache but what there was a dose of senna and manna. Faugh! if the Israelites were fed on that manna they were right in rebelling. Sometimes I had salts, sometimes oil; sometimes calomel and jalap; sometimes a decoction of all the bitter herbs to be found in the pantry; but, even then, there was a glimmering idea of the truth, for all these teas were to be drank hot, to put me in a sweat." "Just so,' resumed Dr. Sollinger. "Many of these doses produce a violent commotion, and a profuse perspiration; yet the action is unnatural, as well as the means employed. Why should we disturb the normal action of the stomach in order to restore the normal action of the skin?" "I confess," said Mayhew 'that would be a dif- ficult problem for me to solve' "Of course, if there is a load of stuff in the stomach, such as a glutton and a drunkard may have accumula- ted, to save the patient's life even something allied to a surgical operation may be resorted to; but, ordinarily, give Nature a fair chance and she will manage the trouble. Do not add to the difficulty, that is all. Medicine, as a rule, does add to it. There is temporary relief, but an evil left in the place of it quite as injuri- ous. But let me come to a plain exposition. "All curable diseases result from some abnormal condition of the human system. If we can gently veer   The Secret of Life and Heallt.   245 the patient around, so as to get him or her on the track again, we are all right. A sick man is a locomotive off the rails. "I propose doing this by bringing the mind, as well as the body, in kindly subjection to the operations of Nature. "' First, I demand repose for the patient; not simply bodily repose, but spiritual. His weary spirit needs rest. He has gone away from his Creator, in violating Ilis natural laws, and he must be restored to Him. "No man is ever so approachable as when he is ill. At that time I would take no advantage of him. My object would not be to 'convert him,' or to have him acknowledge himself to me as a sinner; but simply to impress upon his mind the necessity he lies under to cease from struggling against himself. A mind rebel- ling against the body, because the latter is helpJess, is adding, all the time, to the difficulty; a mind that is fretful, and worrying erver the duties of life, ever restless and uneasy, but adds to the fever which is raging in the blood "Repose! repose! The sick child seeks its mother's sheltering bosom. Its little hands drop listlessly; its thoughts cease to wander on top and ball, on play or strife. If not prevented by absolute pain, it sinks to rest with a sveet satisfaction. Its mother is the guardian angel. It has no care for the morrow. Man is the child of God; he must seek his rest there. If not the full perfection of spiritual joy, at least an approximation thereto. It is a part of the law of Nature. Repose! "Then I would approach the mere physical difficulty We find, often, that it results from a deranged system,     246     Romance of the Table. caused by long inactivity of some of the organs of the human body, and over activity of others. Let us take dyspepsia, that most common and fearful of maladies. If we examine such a patient we will find that he is in a wretched state of abdominal inaction. He has, probably, stimulated his brain to the utmost, and left his stomach to get along as it could. Now, there is no part of the body which is not to have its due exercise. Every artery and vein is in motion, to pass the blood to or from the heart; every joint, muscle, tendon, gland, would be , more injured through inaction than in any other way. The limbs would shrivel, but for exercise; yet the stomach, which, we are taught, is the seat of all diseases, is the most abomina- bly used and the most utterly neglected of any organ of the human body. Some people are so hollow, externally, that a loaf of bread might be placed in the cavity of the stomach, while there is not room for a erumb inside. Now, what does Nature teach? To put medicine in the man? No; but to put strength, the power to digest food. The loaf must go in, and the crumb come out. The condition must be entirely reversed. How is this to be done? 'By exercising the stomach, inside and out." Inside and out!"It was a queer phrase and the interest of his auditors increased. "The outside exercise must be given with the human hand-the patient's own hand, or another's, which would be better. A gentle motion, like the kneading of bread, oft repeated, and especially after eating The power and sympathy of the human hand is great, and when to it we add the motion imparted its power is largely increased.   The Secret of Life and Health.   247 "But now for the motion inside. This can only be given by food. Not by your concentrated essences of meat; not by rare mutton and beef; not by delicacies and sweets; not by strong tea and jellies; but by plain, wholesome, non-heating and non-stimulating food. Instead of concentration we must have bulk. Any other doctrine must be a fallacy, for it is opposed to Nature. "But how introduce this food into the stomach? That depends on the condition. Aggravated cases require much time and patience, but my general rule, is this: Fast, that we may eat. "Repose! Fasting! Both mind and body doing penance. But the fasting and the rest must go together The body cannot work without food, as the fire cannot continue without fuel. While fasting, strength must be given by the hand, and tone through the motions I have referred to. Imper- ceptibly the stomach begins to live again; it awakes from a long sleep, and demands food. When this state of affairs comes about, and it may take days to effect it, then give food: potatoes, principally, coarse bread, and a little fruit. This distends the stomach; with distention comes action, and with action restora- tion. Not all at once, for he who has been years in sowing the tares of ill-health cannot be restored in a day to his pristine condition. The fasting must be often protracted, and the manipulations constant and persevering. Possibly the entire coat of the stomach may be so destroyed that it cannbe tored; but if not, there is hope. I add another to the two- Repose! Fasting! Perseverance! Here we have the trine. Out of this trine will be born new ideas and new hopes. 4    ,      .     248     Romance of the Table. "Enough for to-night," said the Doctor. "I want an apple and a biscuit; and I dare sa3 you are all hungry. On the next evening I will say something about the use of water. Now you may fire a'way, if you please, with your objections." "I think we will wait until you are through," said Dr Lorton.  "You may broach some dangerous heresy, yet; for the present I heartily agree with you." "And I, too," said the bachelor, "except in leaving out the chops and French- mustard. You Will not get me into a long fast without these, and a pickle in prospect." "There would be a pickle in prospect," replied Dr. Sollinger, "for both you and me-a pickle, probably, neither of us would fancy when we got it."   CIAPTER   XVI. THE SUBJECT CONTINUED. We are all diseased, And, with our surfeiting, and wainton hours, Have brought ourselves into a burning fever, And we must bleed for it.-King Henary IV., Part 11. I'ifp may be longthened by care; though death cannot ultimately be defeated.-Dr. Samuel Johnson. The assemblage, on the succeeding reunion of the Club, was equally numerous and select; and there was quite an animated discussion between Dr. Lorton and Mr. Williams, starting from the subject of health, but covering a wide range of ideas. One topic was that of pain. "I understand, of course," said Mr. Williams, "that the sensation of pain is a wise provision of the Al- mighty to lead us to watch carefully against accidents and bodily harm. If we were not aware of being hurt we might be easily destroyed. Pain is the watchman on perpetual guard; a sentinel who never sleeps. So too, I can understand how the nerves carry sensation to the brain; but I do not see how matter is thus affected, Our bodies, nerves and all, are but a combination of the gross elements of Nature, resolvable into salts, phosphates and gases." "Matter is, in itself, insensible," replied Dr. Lorton, "and we must seek for the true source of pain in another direction. The instant the spirit is separate from the body, the latter ceases to feel; and I wish to call your attention to a curious fact. Men in a state     250     Romance of the Table. of intoxication are nearly insensible to pain- so are those who are under the influence of anaesthetics-like chloroform, ether, nitrous oxyd, etc Alcohol is an anaesthetic agent in a fluid, instead of a gaseous, form Now, when such a liquid is imbibed, ol gas inhaled, a step is taken toward separating the spirit from ihe body. leaving the latter dead. Weak patients have been killed by chloroform; and a man can drink enough rum to kill him  The tacit hold which life has is completely severed; the body falls Lo ..he ground, and the spirit wings its way to another sphere. Does not this prove that the sensation is in the spirit of man, not in his natural flesh? ' "It is a very plausible theory," said Mr Williams. "I had a tooth pulled, once, while under the influence of ether, and I felt it distinctly; but not sharply, for I took it with great caution " "Then vour body. and spirit were too closely united, you see; but in many surgical cases the patient is essentially dead. Life retires to some rlys- terious corner of the brain, not reached by the nerves, and comes back to us as soon as it is permit- ted to do so." "But how can spirit feel? inquired Mr Williams how can it be affected by material causes?" There you nave me," replied Dr. Lorton "The mysteries of the body are wonderful, those of the spirit still more so. With all oui science we cannot explain the accretions of matter which form the com' monest vegetable.  We only know   causes from effects It is a law of Nature that water shall rtm together, when it has the opportunity; and if every man, as I suppose, has a spiritual form or essence a    The Secret of Life and Health.   25 w-thin the natural, it must be the law of that spirit to keep its outer covering whole. A disturbance causes a derangement of the spiritual organism, and it resists by in turn affecting the nerves of sensation. The spirit is lealous of the temple in which it dwells, and resists every disturbing force" While Dr Lorton and Mr Williams were thus discoursing, the hum ot conversation was general in the room, and the ladies were deeply immersed in the mysteries and miseries of domestic life, and the mul- titudinous subjects which engross the female mind, when Thomas took the liberty ot calling the meeting to order, and of again introducing Dr Sollinger to the waiting guests I am fearful," said the Doctor, "that this matter will be very prosaic If you formed a class of pa- tients-one with neuralgia, another with rheumatism, one with incipient consumption, and the rest with fevers, lumbagoes, and the other ills to which flesh is heir-you would listen with mingled interest and anxiety. But vou, whose cheeks tell of health, and eyes of pleasure, only think of disease as of death- unpleasant events in some far distant future. "There are, too, many details in every physician's practice which it would not do to impart to the public. Many diseases require peculiar remedies or treatments, which might figure well in a medical work, but are not proper in a popular discussion I can, there- fore, only lay before you general theories, leaving the ininutie either to your own deductions or to be learned when vou become invalids, and tall under my care." "Which, with all respect to you, Doctor, I. hope may be a long way off," said the bachelor. 2      25 .   . Romance of the 7able. "I echo the sentiment," replied the Doctor 'T trust you may never want mre. "Proceed, Doctor," said Mayhew "Well, you understand, from what I have already said, that, while i disturbance of the bodily functions is an indication of disease, the latter is not really of the body, but oQ Lle mind, or spiritual part of man's nature." The same as pain,' suggested Dr. Lorton "Yes, the same. If we note the most common variations 6f mind and matter to which we are sub- jected in this world, we shall not be long in making up our minds on that point. Sudden joy has killed a well person; sudden joy has restored the sick. Grief has had the same effect-in killing, if not in restoring. A mental shock will turn the body hot with fever, or  chill it to the verge of an ague. Fainting fits are induced by rapid mental changes, and r re too frequent and common to need illustration tt is .rue that many acute and malarious diseases are contracted, with which the mind has seemingly nothing to do, yet this proves nothing but our want of a complete knowledge of the subject.

But we will suppose that the patient has obtained the mastery over his own spiritual state, and in the hands of his physician is like clay in the hands of the potter What' next? My plan, as I have said, or as you may have inferred, is to bring the body in accord with the mind, and restore it to a healthy, natural moae of action Although the starting point of disease may be in the soul, there is in the body, too often, a congenial field for its action. . The entire life is but an invitation to disease. "Cleanliness is next to Godliness,' says the pro- rver b; out there may be outward, without inward, cleanliness 'Here is the difference, for 'nstance, between baths A common bath, or wash, gives a tolerably clean surface; but a bath like the Turkish, under a practiced hand, gives us v Sensation never before known." "And what do you think of Turkish and Russian baths, Doctor?" said Mayhew--"if it would no t be coo much of an interruption.'

They bring to the surface the accumulations     ^ 254    Romance of the Table. of effete matter which clog the pores and render the body so liable to disease. You will see, though, and readily, that a feeble man or woman-feeble in nerves or in muscle, mentally or physically-should go through so severe a cleansing process with great caution. These baths make no allowance for either bodily or mental discrepancies, and the attendants put each patient through after a process which is simply mechanical. "My process adapts itself to each condition The object is the same-to cleanse the body of all impurities, and restore every part of it to its normal state of action. I first put a patient on a fast, short or long, according to his strength. This prevents any addition to the morbid accretions of matter. Then I pack him in a wet sheet and cover him comfortably with blankets. The probability is that he sinks into the sweet sleep of rest, and dreams of his early days of youth and happiness Slowly, but surely, Nature is throwing to the surface the burthens she has been forced to carry.

The great object is to restore harmony between mind and matter, and relieve the latter from tlhat which interferes with its proper action.

"' Of course, there are systems and conditions entirely beyond the reach o' the healing art.

Still, I recognize but one road tc health: a supreme abnegation of self, and a firm walk in the right road. Brandy, beer, and stimulants of every kind, I abjure. [ know nothing of a law which teaches us to do wrong that good many follow, nor of a system which would build man up by pushing him down to the gutter." ' In what respect, Doctor, does your system differ from the Water-cure treatment?'" asked Vohlen. "In many respects," replied Doctor Sollinger. :I do not depend upon water as a remedial agent, but only as a ninor accessory If a healthy body is necessary to a sound mind, so, to bring about a healthy body, I desire to restore the mind to health. I depend more upon the action of internal forces than outward agents.' "And somewhat, I perceive, upon the magnetic forces of your own mind," said Mr. Williams. "What is the     256     Romance of tlze Table effect, think you, of the influence of one mind upon another?" I' Temporary, not permanent No man should trans- fer his own soul to the body of another. We see the effect in many of the mountebank exhibitions of what are called psychology, biology, and in mesmerism Carried to extremes, there is an introversion of man's spiritual nature, and an almost total destruction of his self-hood. It is another forn of mental Intoxication, and man ceases 'o be a free agent.

I do not believe," said Mayhew, "that the soothing influence of one mind over another can be otherwise than beneficial. The child, restless and impatient, is sobered down by the kindness and affection of its mother, and especially by the soothing touch of her hand. Grown people have a weakness for being petted-- have, at least; and both an aching head and a mind ill at ease are equally benefited by the touch of a gentle hand. We all know the difference be- tween the warm pressure of true friendship and the cold, formal shake of -ordinary civility.'

'Tis want of sense to sup abroad too late Unless thou first hast settled thy estate. -John Dryden. The discussions which followed the lecture of Dr. Sollinger were long, keen and animated, as may be supposed; when the educated minds, bright wits and universe views of the little Club are considered. In- deed of following them at length, which would almost a11 my volume, I give the information, or theories, enunciated in as condensed a conversational form as possible. Williams.---I have read, in some author, words like these : "Men, in searching for the soul, left the province of philosophy and launched into the realms of specllation. Tley could neither find whereof they were in selarch, nor could they tell what a fever is, nor how quinine cures it." And so it has occurred to with many of our investigations. We can  trace the fiood all the way from the platter to its final point, where, in the shape of an acid, it is absorbed by the blood.;: but how, through that fluid, it enters into conbinatlon with the body again is a mystery. Dr. Zorfol.- Perhaps one way to approach it is to analyze the body of man, and then the food he eats. You know that throughout all Nature runs the law of assimilation--the tendency of certain elements to flow together and form new combinations. Creation   26o    Romance of the Table. never ceases. The microscope has opened new won- ders to our astonished vision. ILife abounds in such minute, yet perfect, forms as to require a magnifying power of many thousands, to be seen by us. Nature is always at work. The smallest particle of animated matter is as astounding as the elephant or whale; and, like them, it is formed by the union of the elements of Nature. Of course, there is a dividing line, which none of us can cross. We know that a diamond and pure carbon are the same; yet all the skill in the world cannot turn charcoal into the diamond. The growth of a vegetable depends on its sending away-eliminating-the oxygen which is contained in its other nourishment. Animals, on the contrary, inhale the oxygen, and on this inhalation- in proper quantity, and :n its proper action, in harmony with the elements of food-the growth and life of the animal depends. We can turn a potato into its original gases, but we cannot take those gases and turn them into a potato. Professor Tulford.-True; heat and motion lie at the bottom of all development. The heat of the sun is in motion; the earth, sea and sky are never at rest. The oxygen which a man inhales-700 pounds per year-is not retained by him, but issues immediately forth again as carbonic acid gas and water. To keep the furnace going-that is, to supply the body with heat-man needs daily fourteen ounces of carbon and thirty-seven ounces of oxygen. With rest we need less food; with active exercise more--the heat of the body passing off more rapidly. A locomotive, in going on an t-p grade, puts on the blowers and gets up all the steam possible; on a down grade the   A Talk all Around the Table     26a furnace doors are shut, and the heat and steam hus- banded. Exactly is it thus with man. The whale blubber eaten in the Arctic regions is all needed for its carbon only; and a man in the torrid zone, not needing an internal fire, can sustain life on fruits -and vegetables. In our climate we find we can eat more int the winter, and we certainly should eat less in the summer. Afayheze.-I think that the reason people are bene- fitted in the tropics, if they do not carry their Northern habits with them, is, that they are not forced to make such constant exertions to keep up their vitality. Nature rests, and  rest is, recuperation. Here, with every change in the weather there is a corresponding change in the body, and the effort to keep up is like the effort of a weak man to keep up with a giant in a race. Dr. Sollinger.-Exactly.  And you see there an illustration of my theory. Rest I Thomson says: "The best of men have ever loved repose; They hate to mingle in the filthy fray Where the soul sours, and gradual rancor grows Imbittered more from peevish day to day." Rest! The fevered head breaks down the body quicker than hunger. Activity is an excellent thing, no doubt; but of what use is it to work four days and be forced to rest two, when, by judicious management, we can work during six: The meat we devour is rendered necessary by pernicious habits; so men excuse themselves for drinking the most fiery and intoxicating beverages on the ground that bodily necessities require it. They use pitch and resin on board the Western boats to make them go faster; and X0     262     Romance of the Table. man eats rare meat, and drinks whisky, to make him go faster; and the faster he goes-that is, the more he takes--the more he needs it. The boiler bursts, fre- quently, and sends its living freight to kingdom-come, and man blows himself into eternity in the same way. The Bachelor.-A very apt illustration. I believe in rest, and I can make a dinner off sweet potatoes; so the Doctor can put me down as a convert. But, tell me, Dr. Lorton, is there any difference between the flesh of an animal which eats meat and one which eats grass? Dr. Lorton.-No; the carnivora, or animals which live on the gramnivora, are identical with the latter in all the essential elements of which their flesh is composed; with this exception-that wild animals have little fat, and gain a great deal if they are well fed. All the fibrous, muscular parts of the body contain about seventeen per cent. of nitrogen, obtained from the food-and that food should contain nitrogen is a necessity; but fat has no nitrogen, and its accumlation is not easy to explain, except by purely scientific deductions, which, here, would be tedious. There is, however, a separation of oxygen from the food, as there is in vegetables. A vegetable is all fat, we may say. Mr. Williams.-Four pounds of starch contain as much carbon as thirteen pounds of flesh. Why is it, then, that meat is so much more rapid in its produc- tion of heat than vegetables containing a large amount of starch? Dr. Lorton.-I will ask Dr. Sollinger to answer the question."   A 7alk all Around the Table.    263 Dr. Sollinger.-I will answer it as the philosopher answered the problem of Charles the Second in -regard to the fish and the water. Why is it that a pail full of water does not run over when a fish is put in it? The philosopher said it was not true, and I am inclined to say the same thing. If it is true, then it follows from a vicious state of the human system. Some men think they must have hot toddies to make) them warm, on the same principle. Look at the vast fields, the immense surface of the earth, spread out before us. There must have been in the Divine mind a direct reference to agriculture, and the support thus of human life. The variety and extent of the produc- tions of Mother Earth demonstrate the fact that she gives us all we really need. The earth is the vast laboratory of Nature. The rains fall, rivers overflow, the sun shines, the air gives its elements-all that man may be fed. In assisting Nature he gives him- self health through activity of mind and body, and she more than repays him. Whatever is best adapted to assimilation is produced in the greatest quan- tities; and, as I have demonstrated before, we have, through the kindly operations of the earth, both bulk and nutriment. In grains and vegetables we find fibrine, caseine and albumen, from which the blood is enriched and the body restored. We have carbon to heat it, and nitrogen to sustain the waste of the system. Oxygen we draw from the air. I havel already shown that if we do not breathe right the lungs lose their vitality and decay, and that the same follows when the stomach loses its power. The true reason why we do not get heat enough from other food than meat is because we do not really use it. I     264     Romance of the Table. was once amused with the attempt of a man to live on vegetables. He ate poor bread, watery potatoes, soggy hominy, and radishes-not an article of proper quality or quantity. Mayhew-That puts me in mind of a company of printers with whom I was familiar when a boy. It was at the time when Dr. Graham-who whatever may have been the nature of his theories, introduced us to a very excellent bread-was at the height of his popularity. The printers, all working in the same office, had their table set out each day for dinner, which consisted of two standing dishes; the bread christened after the Doctor, and milk. They adhered to it faithfully, and grew thin regularly. One died of consumption, and I am not sure but the others blew away. Dr. Sollinger.-Exactly. The great difficulty with the race is the tendency to run to extremes. I do not know but it has been said before, but if so, I will re- peat it; every animal exactly follows its own particu- lar nature but man. We may imagine without any great stretch of fancy, that the giraffe gradually elon- gated its neck in its efforts to reach the leaves upon trees a little too high for it; and that, if the trees had gradually grown beyond reach, the neck of the giraffe would still have gone on stretching.- It would have its own food, and no other. But here you illus. trate a curious fact with your story of the printers. These men with all their intelligence knew no better than to make a violent change in their diet, to upset their internal economy, and in fact to starve them- selves to death. Dr. Lorton.-Variety is not only the charm of life,   A Talk all round the Table.   265 but its necessity. The mind is constantly seeking for novelty, and as the mind devours and digests, so the body corresponds to it. There is less danger to the health, I really believe, in a great variety of food, than in perpetual sameness. The man who constantly dines on beefsteak and drinks beer with it, becomes after a while heavy and apoplectic, while the man who picks a little of this and that, and has a liking for dessert, is genial, light-hearted, active, and viva- cious. We do not want so much to eat, but we need what is good, and we must have a change. Mr. Williams.-But that does not always hold good, Doctor; for in comes the Irishman with his potato, the Scotchman with his porridge, the French- man with his soup, the Italian with his fruit and maccaroni. Dr. Lorton.-True to some extent, but yet the truth is not invalidated. Most people manage to find a greater change of food than we give them credit for; and if not, they live on food which their systems have been accustomed to, for ages perhaps, of a particular yet substantial kind. When that is the case, it would cause a commotion to go into any of those fancy dishes to which we are partial. Mrs. Mayhew.-It is not singular, yet worthy of note, how the novelists bring in the table to give a zest to the story. Shakespeare's kingly banquets are numerous and gorgeous, except that at which Mac- beth found an unwelcome guest. But generally they produce sociality- Mayhew.--Or conviviality! Scott gives us many a roystering feast in which man shows how near he can come to the swine. Is it not singular that the animal     266    Romance of the Table. the Turk looks upon with holy horror, man should at times so closely approximate? Mr. Williams.-That puts one in mind of an old scholar and reputed seer, Swedenborg by name, who had many queer fancies. Among others he taught that men in the other life who have given the rein to their appetites and passions here, look in the eyes of the angels like various unclean animals and reptiles; they spiritually put on the forms of the creature which in life they did their best to imitate. Dr. Sollinger.-Well, he may not be far out of the way. We are very apt to compare a man here with an animal, according to what we conceive of his char- acter. Wo say he is a lion if he has courage; a tiger if he is merely ferocious; a. monkey if he acts like one; a lamb if he is mild and gentle; a hog if he is a glutton; a dog if he is brutal or mean, and that by the by does great injustice, often, to the dog. Mayhew.-Yes, and we call each other ducks and doves and birds, and many other sweet names when we are courting--- Dr. Lorton.-And names quite different, often, after the honeymoon. Mrs. MAayhew.-That is naughty, Doctor, and I hope it is not true; at least I am sorry to think it may be true, but there does seem to be a mysterious ,connection between man and the animals below him. Mr. Williams.-He has something of the nature of all animals, with an intellect which ought to control what there is of the baser animal within himself. But to come back to the table and to the writers. There was an author who lived in the I7th century who was much esteemed; Dr. Samuel Butler. He wrote an :   A  Talk all round the Table.      267 amusing sketch of the "Religion of Hudibras," and those who were of the same faith, in which he says: "Still so perverse and opposite, As if they worshipped God for spite; The self same thing they will abhor One way, and long another for; Freewill they one way disavow, Another, nothing else alldw; All piety consists therein In them, in other men all sin ; Rather than fall, they will defy That which they love most tenderly; Quarrel with minced pies, and disparage Their best and dearest friend, plum porridge; Fat pig and goose itself oppose, And blaspheme custard through the nose. Mayhew.-That is curious. Was it not Butler who gave us that oft quoted sentence about "Compounding for sins we are not inclined to, By damning those we have no mind to." alr. Williams.-Yes, it is in the same poem. Dr. Butler belonged to an age when freedom of speech often ran into the greatest license. Dr. Sollinger.-And then hot blood came from their hot and highly seasoned food. The cavaliers of the 17th century were very apt to quarrel, fiercely, at a feast. If they had eaten less, and drank water, a great many lives would have been saved. Mayhew.-And a great deal of doubtful poetry would have been unwritten. Mrs. Mayhew.-Well, I can see very readily that, if we can give the blood what it wants to nourish the body with, it will do it, whether it gets it from one thing or another; from a chicken or a turnip. Dr. Sollinger.-Quite true.  I never expect to re- form the world, or change it from its course. I only drop one little pebble into the rushing tide. Glut-     268     Romance of the Table. tony destroys more lives than intemperance; but we hear of no anti-glutton societies. I preach more against the excesses of mankind than I do against the use of animal food. The latter is looked upon, very strangely, as the necessity of the table; while all things else God has given are but the adjuncts-to the feast. It should by reversed. Meat should, at least, be eaten sparingly, and vegetables and farinaceous food more largely. Vohlen.-There I think you are right; and now, if you have no objections, we will adjourn, for I see Mrs. Mayhew is thinking of the baby; and when a woman is thinking of that, it is time for the men to put on the rubbers. Mayhew.- 4 He smiles and sleeps' Sleep on And smile, thou little young inheritor Of a world scarce less young. Sleep on, and smile!

So now is come our joyful'st feast, Let every man be jolly; Each room with ivy leaves is drest, And every post with holly. Though some churls at our mirth repine, Round your foreheads garlands twine, Drown sorrow in a cup of wine, And let us all be merry.-George Wither. Reader! how many years back can you remember? If the months of the years are reckoned as hours, and the two hands of the clock come together on the first of January, how many times have they thus met since you began to note time by its loss? But, however far back Memory may carry you, it will find no hiatus at the holiday season of the year; no Christmas without its Santa Claus; no New Year without its merry interchange, of greetings, and its "feast of fat things and wine on the lees." I think I may venture to say, without fear of contradiction, that Christmas is the first day you remember. I dare say you will recall the fact that you were sent to bed at a very early hour, for fear the jolly old Saint should come, and, finding you up, should depart in a huff, leaving no mementos behind him. And then, when you awoke! Did clothes ever go on faster, or eyes ever shine brighter? Did not the plethoric stocking deliver its treasures in double quick time, and did not the tin horse and its rider go upon a gallop; the penny trumpet sound a ferocious onset, and the pewter soldiers meet the assault with the bravery of grenadiers?     270     Romance of the Table. It is very possible that the toys soon grew common that, after a few days, you began to investigate the mechanical movements in which a piece of a quill, passing over three wires, produced the music by the sound of which the shepherd and the sheep proceeded to the pasture; but, if so, the next Christmas was just as eagerly anticipated, and its delights were as strongly  appreciated. But the cruel shock came at last; the spell resting upon Santa Claus was broken, and youth received its first lesson in the hollowness of worldly things. Yet, even with all the gathering of years, and the blighting of other faiths and hopes, the mind clings to those earliest days of absolute thought with more and more veneration, as the years roll on. We go back to them to rest-for the peace, and love, and innocent faith of childhood. And, as to the New Year-we little thought, then, that the years could go too fast. Youth was a mine to draw upon, and we believed it endless in its pro- ductive power. We absolutely thought the world was called into being on that day, and we wondered, doubtless, at the dim stories from the old family Bible about Adam and Eve, and the garden of Eden. How could it have been so beautiful, in the middle of winter? It was an era in our lives when, in all the glory of frock-coat and gloves, we started out to make our first calls; when we essayed door-bells with trembling nerves, and handled the old-fashioned door- knockers tenderly, tor fear the noise might disturb other nerves inside. And our story brings us to another season of festiv- ity-to more kisses and well wishes; to more presents and congratulations. A Merry Christmas and A   Christmas and New Year's Day.   271 Happy New Year!-sounds that are welcome more because they are heart sounds than because they herald a festival. People do come very near to each other then; and there is a closer approximation to a universal brotherhood than at any other season of the year. A Happy New Year! finds responsive echoes in many hearts. We run back to our childhood again, and feel the sympathies of children in our souls. The Mayhew mansion was very happy and bloom- ing on that particular Christmas day. It was the first holiday of the wonderful baby-if that can be said of a life which, so far, was all a holiday. It was a wonderful baby, little as we have said about it; a very wonderful baby; and its two grandmothers coin- cided with a unanimity of decision which would be astonishing in any ladies but grandmothers. The grandfathers agreed in opinion, of course, with the rest of the world. It would hardly have been safe for them, otherwise. There is a point when patience does cease to be a virtue, and that point-that passable Rubicon-is a difference in opinion respecting the grandchildren. Human nature can stand much, but it cannot stand that. Fortunately, there was harmony in the Mayhemv household; harmony among all the grandmothers, grandfathers, uncles and aunts of the tribe of Mayhew, old and young, away down to the cousin whose consan- guinity was so remote as to defy classification, but who was ever welcome to a seat in the corner, and the tea and toast of the family table. The baby was a wonderful baby. We have said so before, but it will bear reiteration. It looked like its father, its mother,     ^2   XR r .nce of the Table. its grandfathers and grandmothers, and its various aunts, uncles and cousins. A remarkable similarity of chins was detected, one day, between the baby and the cousin who could not be classified, but who was still a cousin. And on this, his first, Christmas Thomas Jr. was to have his stockings hung up-the unconscious inno- cent! They would hold nothing, but the mystic charm would not work unless the little socks were in the chimney corner. So there they were, suspend- ed by the little white -ribbons which drew them around the ankle; and there were the presents close by, on a little table. An ivory rattle-box, with which the baby tried to demolish its own head, and, failing in that, tried to swallow-and failing in that, also, dashed upon the carpet. Then a silver cup and spoon; a rubber ball, containing a whistle; a ring, on which it might exercise its gums; a jumper, in which it might develop a love for gymnastics, and such a host of toilet articles and dresses that Thomas offered to take his wife into partnership on the strength of her stock in trade. This particular Christmas, too, was to be a grand event in the Mayhew calendar. They were to give a dinner-nothing grand or elaborate, but a real home affair. Just the family-the dear ones who cluster around each other, and run together on a Christmas as naturally as globules of quicksilver. Yes, there was the bachelor, beside; and people did say that the bachelo- was there because Florence's next-in-age sister was there-a young lady who was a great deal more talkative than Florence, but who had the same eyes and hair. The bachelor was not old, either, even   Christmas and New Year's Day.   273 if he was a little indolent, as men are apt to be who have a snug income and do not have to work for their living. An American Christmas dinner-table is generally a Christian' feast. The spirit of the day descends upon it, and sanctifies it. One of the most beautiful pictures in the world, I think, came from Dusseldorf -an infant in a manger, shedding a radiance briglt- er than the sun upon all surrounding objects. The shepherds shade their eyes with their hands as they gaze upon the infant CHRIST. And that light seems to penetrate all happy households on each return of His natal day. It shines on our faces as it did upon the shepherds'; it gleams from the eyes of the boy as he shouts his "Merry Christmas!" in the street; it strug- gles through door and window; the air is- filled with itrand the table--well, sit around that; and you won't have to wait long, either, for the light or the warmth. I am forced to say that, notwithstanding the admirable lectures of Dr. Sollinger, the Mayhew table had upon it a noble turkey, and, also, something which, whlen well made, is my heart's delight-a chicken-pie! I hope every lady-reader knows how to make a chicken. pie as Florence made it-but I doubt it. We have not all the same gifts in this world, as I have often mournfully reflected; and a proper chicken-pie is a great effort of culinary genius. The crust so tender and crisp; the chicken so white and well done; the bits of pork and evenly-sliced potatoes; the rich gravy and-but why do 1 struggle after a description? I am but a man-I can dissect a chicke-pie, but I cannot describe it. 18     274    Romance of the Table. And, il my powers fail there, so do I stand in rute admiration before the beautiful array of side-dishes and jellies; of pies and puddings, which round out the feast and make it a kind of epic poem. Kings may feast more daintily, but I doubt whether many of them feast more substantially, or with half so good an appetite. When the cloth is removed, and the fruit is on the ta- ble; when cracking a walnut leads almost inevitably to cracking a joke, and an apple loosens the tongue; when the fire flashes up, and crackles pleasantly as though it would say: t Here I am-and ain't we all jolly!" when the baby is brought down, and is given a red apple to hold, with which it bumps its nose in the effort to get it into its mouth; when the heart overruns with charity and sympathy, and we would, be almost willing to open every prison-house in the land-then comes the light of the CHRIST-child, and the room is aglow with glory. Infidelity has little chance in such a house, on such an occasion. We feel what we cannot express: we know what we cannot explain. We may only hold on to Christianity by threads as light as the rays from a star; yet, in the all-permeating warmth of loving hearts around a Christian table on a Christmas day, we are ready to exclaim, with Tiny Tim, "God bless us, every one!"                  .,   CHAPTER    XIX. VOHLEN'S STORY. PETER PL UM'S THANKSGIVING DINNER. "Hooky and Cooky! exclaimed Peter Plum, on a fine frosty morning in October about fifty years ago "Hooky and Cooky but that's a nation fine turkey!" ' Gobble! gobble!" said the turkey, in reply. The turkey was in durance vile, in a coop of ample size to grow in, but with very little chance for a promenade or to cultivate the acquaintance of his relatives "By Hooky and Cooky T" said Peter again; "if that ere critter don't beat ennything Sorrowful Josh can show, then Deacon Blinders can put me down for a dollar at the next penny collection!" Peter Plum was leaning upon the dilapidated gate of his poultry-yard. He had been feeding the four- legged "critters" in the barn, and he stopped to admire the increasing proportions of the noble gobbler, which was destined to become a martyr to the ancient custom of our race of eating turkey on a Thanksgiving. day. There were a pair of chickens also, penned up, waiting the sacrificial day but the turkey was the pride of the baln-yard,and the king of the feathered tribe, and Peter Plum could not help expressing his feelings in his own homely way. He, too, was a deacon of the Church, and, of course, could not indulge -     276     Romance of Jte Table. in any stronger expletives than those we have quoted. "By Hooky and Cooky!" said he; "if Sorrowful Josh can beat thai Dird he will beat the biggest turkey ever raised in these parts!" Sorrowful Josh was a neighboring farmer, noted for his woe-begone expressiof of countenance, and for his general prophecies of evil to come. Joshua be- lieved in nothing but misfortunes. A cow never died but he had predicted it, and the day was never fair but a tempest was brewing somewhere. He was a pious and devoted member of the Church, and fre- quently raised his voice in prayer and praise; but it would have been a gloomiy view of Heaven for the sinner if he only saw it through the eyes of Sor- rowful Joshua. He never attended weddings, or other festivities, but he doated on a funeral. He was a magnificent sympathizer, for he had lost nearly all his relations; and his remarks on death and the tomb, and the certainty of reaching both, were certainly very edifying. But Sorrowful Josh was partial to turkeys, too, and there had always been a rivalry between Peter Plum and himself. Josh had, as a general rule, come off victorious; though, when he did, he always delivered a lecture on pride and the sinfulness of rejoicing, loud enough to be heard over the neighborhood. "Everything is vanity and vexation of spirit," said Josh. "Why should I rejoice over a bird which only weighs twenty-four pounds, six ounces? Ah! this is a sinful world, and full of vanities!" But, though Sorrowful Josh shook nis nead often, and sighed like a blacksmith's bellows, he had the weakness of examining his neighbors' coops about .   Tlan/sgiving in New England.    2" Thanksgiving time, and of estimating, with critical eve, the weight or a fowl. "Neighbor Dodger has no reason for sinful rejoicing this year," he said, with melancholy satisfaction. ' His turkey cannot possibly weigh over fifteen pounds !" But the soul of Peter Plum was cast in a different mould. He was a cheery old fellow, fond and proud of his productions, but fonder still of his indoor treasures, and of the company of children. ,, By IHooky and Cooky " Petei would say "what is the use of living, if we can't take a bit of comfort now and then ?"

I dare say times have changed very much since I was a boy and I don't believe even 'New Englanders look upon Thanksgiving-day as they did then. That annual festival grew out of the old Puritanic severity of faith, which gave almost as solemn a tone to a day of thanksgiving as to a day of fasting  Both were acknowledgments--one of sins to be forgiven, the other of mercies to rejoice over; but even Puritan rejoicings were ot a very staid and sober kind, min- gled with a good many shakings ot the head, and dismal forebodings of what migh. happen before another vear had completed its course. And they had many reasons for fear, those old Puritan fathers. What between the long winter, the deeD snows, the xndians, and the wolves; the short season for harvest, and the many contingencies attending it, they had about as much to sorrow for as to rejoice over, with- out we can fall back upon the safe Christian philoso-      278     Romance of the Table. phy which makes even our misfortunes blessings ir disguise. In Vermont, at the time of which I speak; a good deal of the old ascetic feeling remained. True, there were no Indians to fear, and the wolves were not very troublesome. Old Method, the family doctor, who traveled around on a Canadian pony with saddle-bags almost as large as himself, was once chased by a dozen wolves, on a bleak winter day, on his return from attending the Widow Buffins' little boy, who was down with the measles. But the Doctor escaped, although he lost his saddle-bags and all his med- icines; and, as no wolves were heard of for a year after that, it was proposed, as a grim joke, that whenever  they did become troublesome again the Doctor should be sent for to attend a dozen children with the mea- sles. The contents of the saddle-bags evidently did for those wolves very thoroughly. The Vermonters, however, kept up, very soberly the staid habits of their ancestors. Fast-day was a fast-day. The young people did not shut up the front of the house, and read novels all day; but they were taken off, in the old brown wagon, to the meet- ing-house, and had their shortcomings properly re- hearsed to them in a sermon two mortal hours in length. And then they went quietly back and read Fox's "Book of Martyrs," or some other equally edify- ing work, until the sun had fairly set, and the day, according to the calendar then in fashion, had come to an end; when they partook, with proper decorum, of a light supper of bread and milk, and apple-pie, those always ready, and always welcome, dishes in the Yankee cuisine.   Thanksgiving s N-Aew Englanda   279 Thanksgiving-day was the day looked forward to by the youngsters, however, and if they thought more of the feast-as a feast, and not as a sacred festival- than the elders, the latter were not slow in the appreci- ation of the fact that the turkey should be made to weigh as heavy as possible, and that the mince-pies could hardly be made too rich. When a French cook has permission to get up a dinner regardless of ex- pense, it is said that a carte blanche is given him-a white card, on which he may write what he pleases; and, if our old Vermont friends did not use the polite French in expressing their ideas, they used the vigor- ous New England dialect, and said, "Dern the ex- pense!" And just at this particular juncture the household of Peter Plum was in a state of unusual commotion; for Thanksgiving-day was not only coming, but with it were coming both the village schoolmaster and the new minister; both of whom, bjy a most singular coincidence, were bachelors. And, by another most singular coincidence, the household of Peter Plum was ornamented with two grown daughters-Hettie and Maria, who were as fine specimens of the corn- fed daughters of New England as could be found anywhere from the source of the Connecticut river to its mouth. If they had arrived to the full weight and stature of New England womanhood, they had been taught to shirk none of its duties; and the coming festival was to be one of those events which would be talked over, for many a day, in the village and town- ship of Pollywoganog. Let it not be understood, however, that the accom- plishments of the two young ladies were bounded by     280     Romance of Ihe Table. domestic cookery. Quite the reverse. The samplers which adorned the walls demonstrated a taste for the arts; and the very carpet which covered the floor of the best room, exhausting, as it did, every prismatic color, was a triumphant refutation of the invidious remark of Mrs. Henny Peck, the newspaper of the neighborhood, that "them gals had no taste!"They were proficient in all kinds of needle-work and embroidery known in those days; and, as Cousin Jim, who came up from the city every Thanksgiving, always brought the magazines with reliable fashion- plates, and as the girls always made their own dresses to correspond, it can be readily seen that Hettie and Maria were always in a position to receive company, however select and a la mode. The crowning charm of the young ladies, however, aside from their personal attractions, lay in their ability to sing duets together in a way hitherto unknown in that part of the country; and this musical proficiency was due to a season in Brattleboro' and the assiduous attentions of a music-master during the winter: who, If he himself sang through the nose, had the good sense to teach his pupils not to do likewise, Peter Plum was a widower, and these daughters were at the head of the household. There were three boys, besides, all grown to man's estate-one being married and living in the neighborhood, the others living at homre; and great, stalwart boys they were, as tall as sons of Anak, and as strong. Before their sturdy blows the tall trees fell, and under their guiding hand the deep furrows were turned and the fields grew white unto the harvest. The boys thought the sisters were paragons ot perfection, and   Thanksgiv'zng in New England.   281 were ready to challenge the world in their defense. So, it was a happy household which owned Peter Plum for a father; and a merry, too, when there was an apple-paring, a corn-husking, or a quilting frolic; and the Thanksgiving dinners of the Plum girls were famous for twenty miles around. Such mince-pies! Really, you don't know what mince-pies are, and I defy you to prove you do. You think you know, I daresay; but ypu don't!"Do you call that a coat!" exclaimed Beau B ummel, examining. with thumb and finger, the outer habiliment of a friend. And "Do you call that a pie!"I exclaim, with equal contempt, looking at the abortions of pie- bakers and pastry-cooks. The pies that Hettie and Maria Plum made were an inch thick, and were such a combination of elements as would have puzzled twenty French cooks to analyze. We must remember that a Thanksgiving-day in Vermont brought together hearty eaters. The brac- ing air was a great promoter of appetite; and it was not often that people came together who weighed their food, or faded away into satisfied oblivion, after the first course. To thank Providence for his bounties and eat nothing but the wing of a chicken, would have seemed a most unchristian contradiction; and it came to be, at least tacitly, considered a part of the Christian faith to eat to the glory ot God, as well as to praise Him with the lips. Thus it was that the turkeys and chickens were penned up, and the biggest apples and nuts carefully selected; that all the resources of the farms were put under contribution; that the whitest flour went into the bread, and the daintiest of summer fruits into     282     Romance of the Table. jellies and preserves. The temperance which frowns upon the juice of the grape had even then made progress, but not that which frowns upon the juice of the apple. Each well-to-do farmer had his own cider-mill, and he looked upon the product as one of the proper results of his industry, as much as the product of the mill which furnished his meal. It had been a fine, open season, at the time of which I tell, and October had brought that richness of hue to the autumn foliage which makes our northern forests so glorious. With November came the winds, and the leaves were whirled hither and yonder, and the stripped trees began to sigh and creak, after the usual wintry fashion; but still the skies were cloudless, and the bright sun seemed loth to leave the scene of his triumphs to the desolate embraces of King Frost. "We shall have snow before Thanksgiving," said Sorrowful Joshua, as he buttoned up his coat tightly, about a week before that happy anniversary. "The wind will be round to the north by Sabba' day, and then look out!" and Joshua trudged after his team, as it was toiling homeward witl the last load of wood. "We shall have a hard winter, arter all this sunshine. It isn't nat'ral for Nater to be allus smiling!" And, sure enough, on Sunday there was a change. The wind died away, and the bleak clouds gathered strongly in the north, like an invading force against the sun's brightness. It. was not, however, until the day before Thanks- giving that the snow began to fall, and then in such soft, gentle flakes as to give a zest to the season. The young people looked upon the snow as a blessing, their minds being full ot sleighing' and coasting   Thanksgiving in New England.    283 frolics; and a winter without snow would have been as great a misfortune as a summer without rain. 4 Wind will be up to-night!" said Sorrowful Joshua, as he looked at the leaden clouds. "It's creeping toward nor'east, every minute. Don't have many quiet snow-storms in November." And the wind did rise, toward nightfall, as Joshua had predicted; and then the snow began to dance and whirl, and accumulate in great drifts. The storm was still at its height, on Thanksgiving morning, when, while the first glimmering of dawn was yet hesitating in the eastern horizon, Sorrowful Joshua came trudging through the sleet, and knocked at Peter Plum's door. Peter was in the kitchen, building a roaring fire. "Let's make it comfortable for the young folks, before they come down," said Peter. "I don't like to see people blue and shivering on such a morning as this;" and Peter was putting on a few logs in the great fire-place when Joshua's knock was heard at the door. Who on airth can that be?" said Peter, 'at this airly hour of the mornin';" and he went to the door. It was Sorrowful Joshua. "Lor'-a-mercy, Joshua!" cried Peter, in astonishment; "is anybody sick to hum?'" "No," replied Joshua, shaking his head dolorously, "but I had a bad dream last night, and somehow all my bad dreams come true. You know the stage did not get through last night?' "Yes, I know that; but I suppose it did not try to come through, on account of the storm, and that it will come up this mornin', on runners." Et     284    Romance of the Table. "Well," said Joshua, "the stage is a mail stage, and ought to be in Brattleboro' before ten o'clock at night; and Locust, the driver, don't stand on trifles. But I had a dream of a fight going on at Dead Man's Gully, and I think the stage is stuck in the snow there." Peter Plum, with all his cheerfulness, was imbued with many of the superstitions of the day; and dreams were freely believed in as forerunners of future events. He had no doubt, either, but that, if any misfortune was at hand, Sorrowful Joshua would dream about it. "Lor' bless me!" exclaimed Peter, why, that is the stage Cousin Jim was coming by! I told the gals he would not be here before mornin', for I was sure the stage would lay by over night. What is to be done?" "Well, we've got to break road, anyhow, to get to the meetin'-house; and, as Dead Man's Gully is only a mile further, we might as well go on, and see what we can find." "I dare say you are right, Joshua, and if you will go home and get your team and hands, I will rouse the boys, and we will start out. We can make up the fire in the meetin'-house, and have it warm before the people get there; and we can warm ourselves there, too, when we come back from the gully." Joshua assented to this, and went off after his horses. Peter roused the young men and his hired help; and, when the girls heard what the trouble was, they came rattling down stairs, frightened at the prospect of any danger to Cousin Jim, but full of thoughtful provision for his comfort. They heated several large stones, to put in the bottom of the sleigh, and wrapped up enough cold meat, and bread and butter, tc feed a small army. They filled a stone jug   Thanksgiving in New England.    285 with boiling-hot coffee, wrapping it up quickly in a flannel blanket that it might retain its heat for a long while. Then came the shawls and blankets, and fur robes, until Peter said, "If any more was put in the sleigh, all the passengers would have to go on foot;" but Peter slyly added one of the heir-looms of the family-a bottle of brandy, which had not been opened since his father died. "There's no tellin' but it may be of use," said Peter. So the men and the horses plunged into the great snow-drifts, and breasted the storm as the hardy sons of Vermont are accustomed to in the winter, growing rosy with the excitement, and rather liking it than otherwise. Joshua was on hand promptly, and, although he sustained his name of Sorrowful in countenance and demeanor, it can be said to his credit that he worked as bravely as any one, and drove through the snow, breaking the roads as he went, without a murmur. By the time the party reached the church the s-un began to peep through the clouds, and the storm sensibly abated. The snow still filled the air, but more from the eddying wind, which took up what had fallen, than from any fresh supplies. The cold was sharp, rather than intense, and the entire party were in good spirits. Stopping at the church, as was agreed upon, they filled the great stoves with wood; and in a few mo- ments the chill of the air was taken off, and Peter felt as though to go any further was only a doubtful venture "What do you think, Joshua? Do you really sup- pose we shall find the stage in Dead Man's Gully?" said Peter.     286     Romance of the Table.  Joshua shook himself before the warm stove. and replied: "Resist not the promptings of the spirit. It is our duty to follow the leadings of the Divine hand. If we find nothing there, we shall at least have done our duty." There was nothing more said. In fact, the young people liked the business so well they would have abandoned the expedition very reluctantly. They had very little faith in the dreams of Sorrowful Joshua, yet they thought it quite possible the stage might have been blockaded in the narrow gorge, which, from the loss of a foot-traveler who had been over- taken by a snow-storm some years before, had been called Dead Man's Gully. On went the party, therefore, plunging through tall drifts, and driving without much regard to either fences or roads. On they went, until they commenced descending a hill which led to a winding road between a cleft mountain, the sides of which rose perpendicu- larly more than a hundred feet. Here, the snow had accumulated in such a quantity that it was utterly impossible to force a passage through with the teams. A halt was called, under the shelter of a huge rock, which had kept the ground comparatively free from Snow. "What is to be done now, Joshua?" said Peter. "Blanket the horses, first," replied Joshua. "and fasten them securely." This being done, Joshua produced from the bottom of his own sleigh three pairs of snow-shoes. They were of his own make; clumsy and coarse, but with strong straps to bind them to the ankle.   Thaanksgiving in New England.   287 "I thought they might be wanted," said Joshua, "and they were the last things I did think of before starting. They are not very handsome, but I guess they will do. And now, Peter, as we cannot all go, I think all had better stay here except me and one of the boys. We can take a pair of shoes with us, which may help some poor wayfarer to extricate himself, if the Lord has spared any-which I very much doubt," and Joshua sighed and looked piously upward. The advice was considered good, and the stoutest of Peter Plum's boys, Willie, being selected, they were nearly ready to set off, when the party were startled by a faint cry, which seemed to proceed from the depths of the snow. "Hilloa! Ho! Hilloa!" Shading their eyes with their hands, the men looked eagerly down the glen, and there, to their amazement, they saw the head and shoulders of a man, muffled up so that his face alone was visible. "Hillcoa Hilloa!"The shout that went back was the shout of Vermonters-a cry that echoed through the hills like the reverberations of artillery. "Hilloa! Hilloa!" Then the two men, armed with their snow-shoes, started off. Their progress, so protected, was slow-to them, at least, eager as they were to reach the place, which their eyes never quitted for a moment. "Here we are!" cried a cheery voice, and "Here we are!" cried Willie, in return; while even Sorrowful Joshua's face relaxed into a smile of satisfaction. It was Cousin Jim, who was dancing, to warm him- self, on top of the Concord coach, almost completely buried in the snow.     288     Romance of the Table. "Won't you walk in, and make yourselves to home?" said Cousin Jim; "although, if you had staid away much longer you would have had to carry us home on your backs." By this time there was a chorus of cries from below, and entreaties to be let up or let out, mingled with such expressions of satisfaction as would natur- ally fall from people kept long in suspense. The explanations that followed were soon over. The driver of the coach had undertaken to force a passage through the gully, but the horses, becoming exhausted and unable to draw the coach, were placed in as sheltered a position as possible, broadside to the wind; and the driver, mounting one horse and leading the others, turned back to the last village they had left, in search of assistance. He, probably, found it impossible to reach them again, and had remained away through the night. The villagers were, doubt- less, digging their way slowly through the gully from tile lower end. The coach presented a barrier to the snow, which had accumulated entirely around it; but not so as to exclude the air from the interior, where the passengers were comparatively comfortable. Besides the cousin, there were three passengers for Brattleboro'-a gentle- man and his daughter, and a maiden lady by the name of Tabitha Bradley. Cousin Jim had managed to squeeze through the window and pull himself to the roof of the coach, where he had trampled the snow down by his vigor- ous dancing; and from this perch, looking over the drift in front, he had discovered the explorers and their teams.   Thanksgiving in New England.    289 The method of extrication was simple and rapid. Joshua and Willie trampled and shoveled the snow away, so as to permit the escape of the inmates from the coach. Then a path was made, on an inclined plane, to the surface of the snow, and the journey thence to the sleighs had to be made on the snow- shoes. The pair not in use were first fastened to the maiden lady's feet, and between the two men she was delivered in safety at the rendezvous. Then Willie returned with the two extra pairs, and the final trans- fer was made. All were somewhat exhausted with their protracted confinement, and the nervous state of expectancy in which they had been kept so many hours; but the rejoicing was so great, and the hearty welcome so overpowering, that the past was soon for- gotten, or, if remembered, it was only as a shadow is remembered when the light appears. Packed into the comfortable sleighs, and drawn by the powerful teams, before which the snow leaped in white clouds, the church was soon reached; and there the party, forget- ting, for the moment, the sacredness of the edifice, laughed and cried by turns, and plunged into the good things with the zest given by long fasting and the rattling ride to their present shelter. Even Sor- rowful Joshua smiled, grimly, and tried to be joyful. "This will, indeed, be a day of Thanksgiving!" said the maiden lady, making a vigorous attack upon the cold ham. "It will, indeed!" replied Peter Plum; "and you must all go home with me, and eat your Thanksgiv- ing-dinner there." "With thanks in advance, most noble eousin," said Cousin Jim, who was smacking his lips in a private pew 19     290     Romance of the Table. "And we had better be moving," said Joshua. "We have yet to prepare for the worship of the sanctuary, before we again partake of the bounties of Prov- idence." Without more ado the party again took their seats, and it was with a kind of conquering march that the deeply-laden sleighs halted before the family mansion of the Plums; and not even the sun itself, bursting through the clouds, looked half so rosy or so warm as Maria and Hettie, at the door. It is said that Cousin Jim was so overcome with emotion at his hair-breadth escape that he kissed each cousin several times in succession without knowing what he was about. There was an army of neighbors, too, who, having heard of the possible accident to the stage, were waiting to know the result of the expedition; and, so glad was everybody, there is no doubt the maiden lady could have found a husband on the spot, had she desired one. The service that day at the church was especially solemn, the new minister thinking it his duty to "improve the occasion " to the " edification of souls;" and his "grace" at the dinner-table was so near like a Thanksgiving sermon, in length and matter, that Cousin Jim profanely wished it had been pronounced after dinner, instead of before it. "Bless me!" thought Cousin Jim, "the turkey will be colder than the stage!" The dinner was eaten, and there was enough and to spare. The schoolmaster, thin, and a little seedy-as schoolmasters are apt to, be in a country where they are paid less than clerks in country stores-brightened up, and became a second Dr. Johnson in profundity   Thanksgiving in New England.    29I of knowledge. Sorrowful Joshua, who made one of the party, gave a number of thrilling histories of hair- breadth escapes, and of his wonderful dreams by which people were notified of their coming doom. But Joshua did justice to the turkey and the pies, the more so as he thought that his turkey could go to market-a clear gain of a dollar. After dinner the home-made cider made its appearance, and such a succession of good things and kitchen marvels, ex- tending through the entire evening, that there were serious thoughts in Cousin Jim's mind that Sorrowful Joshua would, through a dream of premonition that night, condemn every soul there present to death by apoplexy. It is a fact, however, which settles that question that the family Bible of Peter Plum contains a record of the subsequent marriage of both Maria and Hettie-one to the new minister, the other to Cousin Jim-with other records of minor events, very common in the households of happy husbands and wives. \l      CHAPTER XX. THE DEATH OF THE CHLD. O child! O new-born denizen Of Life's great city! on thy head The glory of the morn is shed, Like a celestial benison! Here at the portal thou dost stand, And with thy little hand Thou openest the mysterious gate Into the Future's undiscovered land. -Longfellow. The common life of mankind, which we have en- deavored to set forth; the vicissitudes of the million- not great enough to be sensational, yet eventful enough to fill the world with joy and sorrow--is very much like the geological stratas of the earth; and I have often thought what a wonderful resemblance can be traced between things natural and things spiritual! Philosophy and Science point to, at least, the possibil- ity that, at one period, the entire substance of the earth was in a gaseous form, and that, by slow degrees, it condensed, cooled down, and became what it now is. May it not be possible to go a little further, and find an affinity between mind and matter? The body certainly clothes the soul; the immortal principle is conjoined to an earthly receptacle. What is to stand in the way of a living principle in all inanimate forms, which, like ourselves, have passed through the creative mind of the Most High, have been found worthy of a place among His works, and which were the things which He pronounced good?   The Death of the Child.     293 Insensibly we associate man and Nature together; we find a resemblance between a sordid person and a stone. Nothing is more expressive than to term such an individual "cold as a stone," or "hard as a flint " meanness is also compared to dirt, while an opposite character-a man of integrity, pure, and filled with the love of his fellows, is like gold-like the diamond, a jewel of the first magnitude, a star in the firmament of honor and religion. Truth has always found a prototype in water, and the Scriptures are full of allusions to it in that sense. The waters of baptism are significative of the removal of the falsities of the soul, and the general cleansing of the man from sin. Fire, the opposite of water, is equally wedded to poetic imagery, and allied to certain definite principles of the mind. We have both the heat of passion and the fire of love; man is said to be consumed by one and animated by the other. All the way through Nature, from the planets in the heavens to the lowest stratas of the earth, and in the animal and vegetable king- doms, we are forced to admit that the Creator, in crowning His works with man, in some mysterious way allied him with the building beneath him. He alone may have the gift of immortality, yet he alone is the mirror which reflects the entire universe. But where, outside of animated Nature, can we find anything whatever to compare with the love of off- spring; with that wonderful tenacity of affection which follows our children through even the portals of the grave, and which will be satisfied with nothing short of the hope of a future union in a world where death never comes, and the rending apart of souls -nce united is impossible? The tenderness of a     294     Romance of the Table. mother's love, the strength of a father's, has formed the theme of inspired poets and historians. The mourning of Rachael for her children; of David, even, for his rebellious son, have been paralleled in millions of cases since. Cruelty to children, especially by their own parents, fills the Christian heart with hor- ror; while all the sympathies of our Nature are touched, as with the wand of an angel, in their behalf. It is wonderful, indeed, when the lioness will fight even to the death for her young, that man, born in the likeness and image of God, should ever be other than the very embodiment of tender attachment to his. If the fountain of affection was ever filled to the brim-and not only that, but ran over in copious streams-it certainly was so in the love which Thomas and Florence bore to their little son. He was the core of their hearts; the animating, energetic, never-sleep- ing principle of their understandings. "We should not love our children too much," whispered a voice in my ear. And I answered, "I will not, for I cannot." And the voice came unto me the second time, and it said: "Do not let your heart be weaned from Heaven and bound to earth, through your love for your chil- dren." And I answered: "I know of no Heaven without my children!" And the voice came unto me the third time; and it came like the sighing of leafless trees on a winter night, for it said: "The child must die." And I said: "Death has power over the body, but it has none over the immortal soul; I defy it, and will cling   The Death of the Child.     295 to my child, even in my despair, until the dark waters -have opened, and I also stand upon the other shore!" And the child died. *   *   *          **   * k * There were few more careful people than Thomas and Florence; few who made greater exertions to know the true path in life, and walk therein. Each day was ordered in harmony with what they con- ceived to be correct, both in regard to their mental and physical preservation, and healthy progress. They were not precise to stiffness; they were not hard and angular in their movements or conversation; but they simply believed that, as all Nature worked. after harmonious laws of order, so it was their duty, and it certainly was their pleasure, to imitate Nature. Their infant son was trained, it may be said, from his birth; and each day's proceedings were after some ideas drawn from the best sources they could consult. Experidnce, and absolute knowledge gained therefrom, they had none. That came little by little. When there was an apparent difficulty, they studied the cause, and applied the best remedy which was avail- able. A little child, the most helpless of all living beings, needs but little beside proper food, warmth and rest. It generates, at first, but little heat in its own blood, and seeks the warmth of its mother's arms and breast. It sleeps most of the time, for its brain has not begun its throbbings, and the vital life which flows from thought yet slumbers in its little heart. It cries only when it suffers; or when, by injudicious forcing, its mind is preternaturally developed, and it demands more than it has. even. the right to recognize. It is the     296     Romance of t/e Table. piide and delight of many mothers to narrate the pre- cocity of their children; how much they know, yet how young they are! We cannot force the teeth of a child to grow; why should we force its brain to act?  We do so at the risk of future suffering-perhaps, of the child's life. It is better to repress forwardness than to encourage it. A house must have a founda- tion; a child must have a body. The latter is first in order; the mind comesnext. Teach a child to be a child, and not a man. And these were the qrinciples on which Florence and Thomas acted. Th, were imbued with the feel- ing, also, that, as they harmonized their own natures with the highest principle of action, they should bring around them the spiritual influences of the unseen world. They were devout believers in a future state, and in the attendance of angelic spirits upon mortals. "We are having news from Heaven," they softly said, as the boy smiled in his sleep. They almost fancied they heard the whisper of the angel. They certainly believed it was not a poetic fancy, but a reality. There had been one or two assemblages of the Club after the Christmas holidays; but the topics of discussion and conversation were of a desultory charac- ter,'bearing more upon holiday topics than philosophy or science. It was very cozy in that dear dining- room, with its ever cheerful blaze, and the light of happy faces. The sisters of Florence were regular attendants, and the grandfathers and grandmothers were almost sure to be 'on hand also. The baby was the source of attraction; and it became a habit to drop in to tea on those particular days, and there to stop   The Death of the Child.     297 through the evening. Dr. Sollinger had left the city, and established himself somewhere in the West. His loss was regretted; for, however people differed in regard to his views, he, at least, afforded them food for thought and conversation. "His views are not particularly new," said Dr. Lorton. "All physicians would probably agree with him theoretically; but the trouble is, that the awful amount of sickness in the world prevents his ideas from being extensively acted upon. A physician in a large city who should attempt to follow such a practice would starve to death himself, and three- fourths of his patients would die for the want of attention. We have to patch up, rather than cure, from the very necessities of the case, leaving the patient to find out for himself what are Nature's laws, and follow them if he pleases." "Dr. Sollinger," said Mayhew, "is a missionary. He reaches many whom he cannot treat. His life and his practice are a sermon, and many are living partially, if not wholly, according to his precepts, impelled thereunto by the living example he offers of their value." "It will be a long while, I fear," said Florence, "before any large portion of the world will follow in his footsteps." "Yes," responded the'bachelor; "it is somewhat like trying to civilize Africa. The missionary is quite as apt to be served up for dinner as to have his words listened to, or his precepts regarded with favor." Thus passed the winter, followed by the cold, damp days of early spring. The season was unhealthy, and r  /       .     298     Romance of the Table. children, especially, were attacked. There was a prev- alence of, that terrible disease, diptheria; and many a household was desolated by its sudden and insidious approach. Thomas and Florence were little apprehensive; for, not having passed through that kind of affliction, they did not realize its possibility. They were lulled to sleep, also, by the general care they exercised over the one little lamb of the fold. They were not aware that they left open a crack or cranny for disease to enter. They had not shut out the air, and they had not exposed the child to any sudden changes. He was taken out daily, to accustom him to the open air; and he had his food and rest with commendable regularity. Yet were they awakened, one clear, damp, oppres- sive night, when the atmosphere is breathed with difficulty, by that hoarse, shrill sound which sends an arrow straight to the mother's heart. Florence sprang from the bed, trembling in every limb. The crib of the child was by the side of the parents, and in a moment a light was obtained and Florence bent over the little bed with that nervous eagerness which seeks to know the truth at once. Thomas followed without delay, and with an anxiety which he nobly repressed for the sake of his wife, who stood by his side. The boy was apparently sleeping; yet there was the hot flush of fever upon his face, and his lips were dry and parted. His breathing, too, was spasmodic and hoarse; and again he coughed, with the dry, deep sound that indicates a serious obstruction. The -hild iad had a slight cold for some days, but nothing was   7The Death of the Chzild.    299 thought of it, although the usual simple remedies had been applied. "I think it is croup, darling," said Thomas. "Do not be alarmed; we have medicine for it, and I will prepare some immediately. I will also heat some water, and we will apply a hot bandage to his chest. Take him with you in bed, and be cool and collected. It is nearly morning, and so soon as day breaks I will go for the doctor." Thus cheered, Florence did as she was bidden; and Thomas, with the speed of a loving father, did every thing his active mind could suggest, both for the safety of the boy and the comfort of the mother. The day seemed long in coming, however, and the moments were still more tedious before Dr. Lorton was at the bedside. He examined the child thoroughly, and looked grave. "It is not ordinary croup," said he. I do not wish to alarm you; but I fear it is diptheria. We must act promptly, and do the best we can, trusting all will be well. God is good. In His hand are the decisions of life and death. If it be His will, the child will be spared." Florence took the Doctor by the arm, and looked straight into his face. Her eyes shone bright, but her face was white as the morning-gown in which she was still robed. "Doctor!" whispered Florence, between her com- pressed lips; "tell me all. You think the child will die!" "I hope he will not, my dear Mrs. Mayhew, and while there is life there is hope; but I will not hide it from you that the case is serious. He has a good     300     Romance of the Table. constitution, inherited from you; but he is young, and the disorder taxes the strength of the strongest. Let us hope. Much depends on you. Put your trust on high, and, through your strength and love, he may yet live." After the first shock was over, it is astonishing with what fortitude Florence addressed herself to the duties of the sick chamber. She became the strength of her husband, as well as the nurse of the child. She was pale and serious, but calm and resolute. There seems to come down from above, at such times, a spiritual infusion of inner life to the soul, which not only defies the weaknesses of the body, but sheds a brightness over its approaching dissolution. John Wesley requested those around his couch to sing him over the dark river; and I have known instances of such an exaltation of mind at the very threshold of death as to deprive the latter of all its sting, and to open the gates wide that stand between ourselves and the eternal world. And thus it was with Florence. As soon as it was known she was in trouble such a host of friends came as showed how much she was beloved. Not many penetrated to the sacred precincts of the mother's room. Some came to the door and tapped lightly, for fear a noise might disturb the infant or its loving nurse; some did not even do that. but lingered by the door until they could see the servant, or some friend, coming out, and then they spoke in whispers, even in the street. How the gay and most thoughtless will sober down, at times, when they come within the shadow of affliction! There were bright, laughing girls-like butterflies, almost, in their taking no heed for the morrow-who leaned their heads   The Death of the Child.     301 against the door-post and wept, just with the thought that one they loved so well was sorrowing within, and that possibly the little one they had kissed and dan- dled, as, though it were a doll, might even then be winging its flight to the ever-blossoming gardens of Paradise. Thomas, as we have suggested, was weaker than his wife in view of their prospective loss; yet he strug- gled manfully for her sake. He was a man of such tenderness of reeling that at times he could not con- trol himself. Then he would steal away into some distant room, and, throwing himself upon a bed, he would give vent to his feelings in a copious flood of tears. And he prayed, too, earnestly: not that the child might be spared, but that the Divine hand might soften the blow to his wife, and that both mother and father might learn the lesson of resignation. Then he would dry his eyes, bathe his face and hands in clear, cold water, and go out, refreshed and cheerful. Enter- ing the roomwhere Florence sat patiently watching, he would kneel quietly by her side, draw her dear head upon his shoulder, and pour into her ear all the wealth of his love, all the tenderness of his nature, all the hopefulness of his spirit. "I am almost willing he should go, dear," said she to him, after one of those heart-communions; " almost willing. As I have mused and pondered over the trials of life, its cares and vast responsibilities, I feel that I am more equal to this event than to the great charge of leading the child through the perils of the world." "The flesh is too weak for the spirit to be strong," replied Mayhew. "Yet we are to draw wisdom from     302     Romance of the Table. every event. The trials of life are more easily borne because they come singly-each day can bring but a day's burthens; but the death of one we love has, for the moment, no alleviation. We have no hope for something better to-morrow." "No, darling! No! So cries out the body; but when I look far inward, to the very depths of my own soul, I feel and know that there is really n death. Nay, there is hardly a separation. The nearer we ourselves draw to a crystal river, the more plainly shall we see our faces reflected therein; and the closer we draw to the heaven of children, through our own interior states of mind, the more closely shall we be united with them." "So near as to hear them talk to us, Florence?" "Yes, darling, yes!" "And if our pet is taken thither, shall we still have our morning news from Heaven, Florence?" "Yes, darling, yes!" And the husband clasped his wife to his heart, and he said, "O Florence, my own brave a/nd good Flor- ence!" and they wept in each other's a ms. *A   *   * c      * d*     * And the child died.

There is a fascination about war that I do not share, and the stories which, " thick as the leaves of Vallambrosa," have been born of the Great Conflict leave no vacancy for me to fill, even were I inclined to try my skill in that branch of literature. It is with the changes wrought by that event that I have to do, rather than with the event itself. Cities and towns destroyed by earthquakes, or by fire, and rebuilt, are never the same as they were. Sometimes streets are widened, and fine structures arise where were formerly but lanes and hovels; sometimes the owl and the bat take possession of shattered towers, and the huts of a nomadic race are formed where wealth formerly held high carnival; and so is it after a desolating war. If there is not utter ruin-if the people are buoyant and elastic-still there is a change.  Circumstances have changed. The current has cut a new channel; thoughts and habits are different; the tone of society is less moral. We cannot either mourn over defeat or rejoice over triumph without some change in character. 20     306  -  Romance of the Table.  Would it be true to say our country has not changed?-that the children who have been or- phaned, the wives who have been widowed. the people who have engaged in deadly conflict and escaped, are still the same? Wars, especially civil wars, invariably lead to looseness of morals; to wild speculations; to desperate means to accomplish un- worthy ends. The cause may be a good one, but a cause that must be wrought out by the curse of civil war will, for a long series of years, leave its path of desolation. Affliction may purify and ennoble some, but blood has the same effect upon man as upon the tiger.  Mayhew saw the coming storm even quicker than his partners, and there were many anxious consultations in regard to their future course. It was early decided to curtail their business, more especially with the South; nursing their trade more at the North and West, but using great care and prudence in all their transactions. With this they concluded to curtail all their expenses, both in the store and family. To better accomplish the latter end, Mayhew con- cluded to remove to the country; and he was the more inclined thereto from the delicate state of his wife's health. With all her courage and mental fortitude, the loss of the child had been a severe blow to Flor- ence. She bore up, like a brave little woman, and her face never lost its cheerfulness before her husband; but often while he was absent she would sink in body and mind, and shed in secret the tears which she resolutely kept hidden from Thomas and the world. But he, with still a lover's eye, saw that she was pining. He knew that she loved the country, for they   Telz Years Later.      307 had there passed the summer succeeding their loss; and there Florence recovered some of her own bright cheerfulness. They rode and walked together and inspired deep draughts of that life which Nature lavishes with such a prodigal hand. Not only with the consent of his partners but by their urgent entreaty, therefore, Thomas secured a charming little cottage-in a part of the country he knew would best please his wife; for she had friends there, quite as dear and intimate as those she possessed in the city, outside of her own immediate family. In fact, it was an arrangement with her own father and    mother that they should  follow  as soon  as they could dispose of their city home. An acre of land was all Thomas absolutely possessed, yet it seemed almost as if he possessed- the world; for, far off in the distance were the mountains, and before him was the valley through which wound a pleasant little river; and  the many-colored  landscape, the groves and forests, the blue sky over all, and the odorous atmosphere, were all for him and his. And here, with all tenderness, hebrought his wife; a)d  with her came her youngest sister, Ada, and her servant, Rose, between whom and her mistress had sprung up a strong feeling of attachment. The city house was sold, and with the proceeds not only was the cottage paid for, but there was a little sunm laid by for pos- sible contingencies. And   a dear, sweet little home was Florence now the mistress of, and around her were gathered all that she most delighted in; her piano, her favorite articles of furniture, even down to the work-basket her looks and pictures. The garden was stocked with    308     Romance of the Table. fruits and flowers; the little stable possessed a little pony and carriage, and the early morning gave more than one announcement of a chicken-yard. A moth- erly cow grazed in a hired pasture, and a well of pure water, in which hung an old oaken bucket, was near the door. "Oh! it is very beautiful!" said Florence to her husband, as they stood at the door, one bright evening in May, and watched the changing hues of the clouds as the sun sank below the horizon. "It is very beautiful, and we shall be very happy here; shall we not, darling?" "Of course we shall!" replied Thomas. "How could it be otherwise? We are fortunate in not hav- ing a palace, or even a castle, to take care of; yet we have untold wealth in earth, air and sky. We live beneath the dome of the Great Architect, and have all the works of His hands to minister to our comfort. Why should we not be happy?" As the clouds gathered in the political horizon, and terrible anxieties filled the public mind, it was a great relief to Mayhew to steal away from business, and find himself once more within sight of his little home. When the great crash came at last, and he saw that war could no longer be avoided, Mayhew took the news home to the companion of his counsels, as well as of his affections, and together they discussed the situation of the country as well as their own situation and prospects. The business of. the firm, thanks to Mayhew's prudence and foresight, was in a condition to stand any ordinary shock; and they had wisely looked to certain probabilities in the demand for goods which turned even war to their advantage.   Ten Years Later.      309 And here we drop, for awhile, the thread of our story. During the struggle all men played their part; some with honor, some with dishonor; some supported the country in its struggle against threatened dissolu- tion; some were lukewarm, and some played the patriot's part when they saw money was to be made, but not otherwise. Mayhew did his share, manfully. He stood by the right; he supported his country; he sustained the faltering; he comforted the sick, and he was especially active where there were orphans to care for, and the heart-sore to relieve. Florence, too, was ever an angel of charity; and in her new walks of usefulness she found such a balm for her own wounds that she recovered all her wonted cheerfulness and buoyancy of spirits. The light came to her eye and the color to her cheeks. "War is a terrible thing," said Florence, onp day, as she returned from a visit to a hospital. "Yes," replied Thomas, "but an angel of mercy from the field of war is very beautiful." So passed the rolling years. The Club had been scattered; new attachments and duties absorbed the attention; and, ere my next chapter opens, the country will have passed through its mighty struggle, and is striving, like a fallen giant, to again place itself in an upright position.     CHAPTER      II. COUNTRY LIFE AND COUNTRY LIVING. Love, it is the soul of Nature, And the. breath of life is love; Flowers their fleeting colors mingle In the field and in the grove; Birds pour forth from leafy branches Many a love-ecstatic song; Little brooks of true love bubbling, Steal the flowery vales along. --1redrica Brewer. Eden! Well, reader! what are you thinking about? Eden! This word has been used a great many times; de- scriptively, symbolically, prosaically and poetically. It always conveys some impression; what is it? Eden! On the whole, we are inclined to think the entire meaning of that particular substantive could not be conveyed in less than a volume. It is employed because it is so short and means so much. It leaves a great deal for the imagination to work upon, and saves the author a great deal of labor. Eden was the residence of our first parents. It is supposed to have been very perfect; and, as perfection in a residence varies according to each one's ideas, so, with a million of readers all busy upon the subject, we may expect, and look for, some superexcellent views of perfection far above the ability of a writer to set forth. Imaginatively there is nothing we may not attempt to grasp. Eden is only another name for Heaven.   Country Life and Country Living.   3" We hardly attempt to realize the latter in thought, but we merge it into the former; for a paradise on earth is the only tangible idea of a paradise above. You, reader, if you are poor, imagine what you would do were you rich; what bowers of beauty you would create; what sloping lawns and wooded copses you would possess; how you would plan your house, with tall oaks waving their foliage above it, and a limpid stream winding near you. Stretching out before your eyes should be fertile valleys and plains, and the blue mountains, or perhaps the sea, should bound your horizon. There should be cattle upon the hills and in the meadows; fruit upon the trees, in the season thereof; peace and plenty everywhere. And you, reader, if you are rich, are attempting every day of your lives to create a Heaven. You achieve to-day your problems of yesterday, but you lay out fresh for the morrow. There is always some- thing to be done; and the chances are that, when you can find nothing more to do, you become restless and dissatisfied, sell out your home and commence cre- ating another; oryou go abroad-ever restless, ever aspiring after novelty. But so was it not with Mayhew and Florence. With chastened spirits and in humbleness of heart they did commence life anew; but with no eager, passionate longings for the impracticable. Florence was of a nature that with the most moderate sur- roundings there was contentment, and Thomas was happy when he saw she was so. Their minds clothed Nature with loveliness; they found beauty where others could see nothing, and heard music when other ears were closed.     312     Romance of the Table. Two years had swept over their heads, and they stood, with their arms around each other, on the piazza of their cottage. They came thither, every clear evening, to watch the sunset. With a few fleecy clouds waiting to be bathed in the golden light there was a glory upon the landscape which penetrated their inmost hearts, and awakened the tenderest emotions. "Father, dear! Mother dear!" said a child, standing at the gate, " is not the sky beautiful! See how blue it is, and the clouds are gold and white and purple!" Father! Mother! Yes, it was even so; and the blue-eyed girl, her cheeks showing the rosy hue of health, held by the hand a boy of five years of age, who was the image of Thomas, yet with all the softness and tenderness of the mother. The children seemed to be part and parcel of Nature, as they stood there resplendent in country health and beauty. They were a part of the sky, in their eyes and golden tresses, and the evening light clothed them in glory, as though. they were the children of the sun. Neither Thomas nor Florence were very much changed. One showed the maturity of manhood; the other, the matronly charms of perfect womanhood, with all the feminine graces of youth yet lingering in form and feature. If one was serious, and the other pensive, there was no melancholy marking them as its vic- tims. They were happy as human beings can be- sensible of the responsibilities of life, which even happiness brings to us all. They had been blessed with two children; and, as they watched their glowing faces turned upward to the sky, they only pressed, each closer to the other, in oneness of thought and feeling.   Country Lzfe and Country Livib t.   r 3 There is hardly a sweeter spot on earth than tiat over which the Mayhews claimed proprietorship. It was neither grand nor romantic. There was no ocean in the distance, telling, on stormy nights, of ship- wrecked mariners, and hoarsely 4inging the requiem of the drowning; neither were there mountains lifting up their hoary heads to heaven, keeping watchful guard over dark ravines and foaming cataracts. There were hills and valleys, each dressed in the rich foliage of summer; and the eye took in a long stretch of that landscape scenery, the greatest charm of which is its constant reference to the goodness of God and the industry of man. The colors and hues, changing. constantly with the sun's position, gave a richness to the scene which only a purely agricultural country possesses. "It is very beautiful, to-night! dear," said Florence to her husband; "and it seems so wonderful that ten years have gone by since we left the city." "Yes, it is more like a dream than reality," replied Thomas. "Happiness makes time very short. To think, too, of the work we have done here! Do you remember how dreary it seemed when we first came?" "Yes. I remember you sat down upon a trunk, and looked out upon the dripping trees with a sigh of despondency. You missed the dear home, and our sociables, and the thousand little comforts of a city home-did you not, dear?" "I am not sure. Only, I believe we can never make a change without feeling it. If we take a tree from the ground, it checks its growth; and it is so with man." o1     314     Romance of the Table. "But I remember, when the sun came out," said Florence, "and the drops on the trees were turned to diamonds, that you rushed out of the house, and became a new man. You began to plan and con- trive  " "And you to execute," interrupted Thomas. "There was not the loss of a day before vines began to creep up toward the windows; and flower-pots seemed to come in a whirlwind. There was the breaking out of a'floral distemper all over the place." "And who put up the frames for the shrubbery, and laid out the paths around the house, and planted fruit- trees just where I was going to put another wilder- ness of flower-pots; and built me the prettiest sum- mer-house in the world! Was it Aladdin that rubbed his lamp, I wonder?" "And who established such a sweet little dairy that all the milk turned to cream, and fed the hens so liberally that each laid two eggs a day; and coaxed the birds till our trees became an aviary- " "And who shaved and rolled the grass until it became a green carpet, and formed a croquet set to bring the young folks in, so that I should not pine for company; and trained and trimmed the old grape- vines that give me luscious fruit, and papered and furnished my boudoir so that I did not know it when I came back from the city!" "And who has been the charm of my life, and the solace of my declining years!" cried Mayhew, laugh- ing, "and has strewed roses in my pathway, as though I were a bloody conqueror, instead of a poor, simple old farmer!"   Country Life and Country Livingo  315 "And who is so good as to carry a basket to the city every day," responded Florence, "and bring it home full every night-spending his money just to please a poor old woman!" and Florence laughed, in her turn, and pulled Thomas' ear wickedly. "And who had the whitest of table-cloths, the fresh- est of strawherries and the sweetest of cream ready for him!-and that puts me in mind, Florence, darling, that the sun is down, and I am hungry. Come, Fred- dy! come, Flora!" cried Thomas to his children, "come in, my pets, and let us see what the good mother has provided for her little ones!' *5 w'    \     CHAPTER III. AUNT TIDY AND THE CHCKENS. O beautiful, glad season!

One of our little party around the table in the city dining-room had followed the Mayhews to the coun- try; he discovered, as soon as they left, that the city was a "bore," and a great many other disagree- able things. In fact, he wondered how he had endured it so long-with its dirt and its dearness, its stupid parties and horrid cookery. He declared, too, that he was born a poet; but, for the want of the cows in the pastures and the sheep on the hills, he had never been able to make a rhyme. Now he intended to buy an acre himself, with one cow, one pet lamb with a blue ribbon and a bell, and one chicken. If they lifted his mind up to the production of a poem, however short, he would be encouraged to add to his stock. So the bachelor came-came on the sly, the cunning old fellow-and installed himself in the best boarding- house in the place, with his trunks and books, his own easy chair and desk, and any quantity of odds and ends-for the bachelor was a luxurious fellow, and liked his comfort; and then, when he was fairly settled, f..   Aunt Tidy and the Chickens.    317 he quietly walked down to the Mayhew cottage, and, seating himself in a cane chair on the piazza, waited for some one to come out to be astonished. It was a very singular coincidence that Ada should come out-it was in the afternoon, and Thomas had not come home-and I don't know whether it was a coincidence or not that Ada should utter a little scream and turn very red; but she did both. She had been making biscuit, and there was flour on her apron-perhaps that was the reason; at any rate, she screamed and turned red. "Where did you come from?" exclaimed Ada, as soon as she recovered her breath. "Why, from my boarding-house, of course; where should I come from?" "You don't mean to say that you live here-in this place!" "Yes I do-of course-why not?" replied the bach- elor. "And now please sit down by me, and tell me how you like it here, and where I can find a cow, a sheep, a chicken, and other pastoral surroundings, for I am going to set up in business as a poet." Ada laughed. "You can find a cow in the yard, if you wait until she comes from the pasture, and there are a dozen' sheep in the meadow over there," and Ada pointed; "so get out your paper and pencil, and go to work. But Florence and Thomas will be glad to see you, and- "And you, Ada?" "I can't tell yet," said Ada, teasingly. "It will depend on the quality of the poetry you write after \     318     Romance of the Table. you have seen the cow. But here comes Florence, and I must go see to my biscuit; you will stay to tea, of course?" "Of course I will, and perhaps the biscuit may have a more inspiring effect than the sheep." When Florence saw the bachelor-who, I must again inform the reader, was by no means an ohl bachelor, and was only called so from force of habit and because he took the world so easy-when Florence saw the bachelor the sunshine came to her face and the old light to her eyes, and she took both his hands in hers, and expressed herself delighted, as she really was. "Oh, Mr. Magnum," said Florence, "if you would only come out here to live it would be such a comfort!" "I have come out here to live," said the bachelor, quietly; and the tears came to his eyes, as he saw the moisture in hers, for the thought of both was the same-the dear times of old, and the death of the little one. Florence was astonished and pleased. She mis- trusted that her visitor had not come through pure love of the country, and hinted as much to Mr. Magnum.    / "Well," repliedtthe bachelor, "we will see. I have nothing to do; I like the country very well, and, perhaps, if I can't write poetry I can build a house. That will occupy some of my attention; and I am going to learn to farm, and will turn market-garden- er. I commenced operations to-day, by eating a double allowance of potatoes for my dinner." There was a cheerful, if not a merry, party at the tea- table that evening; for the bachelor was a man of very   Aunt Tidy and the Chickens.    319 great depth of feeling, if he did not often show it ex- ternally. The family affliction was, at the time of which we write, too recent to permit any frivolous conversation; but the fund of cheerfulness possessed by the bachelor was inexhaustible, and if he did not make his friends laugh he kept them pleasantly en- tertained, and they all felt the more at home in their new house for his visit. Mayhew entered into the bachelor's plans, too, with a great deal of interest. The latter insisted on buying a little farm and putting up a house. "If I do not live in it, I can rent it," said he; "but I am going to live in it. I have got just the most motherly aunt in the world, who will come and keep house for me-- Aunt Tidy, we call her-and then you will see what I can do when I set myself to work with a will." To shorten an otherwise long story, Mr. Magnum did buy a little farm adjoining Mayhew's--"just for company, you know," said the bachelor-and on it he put just'the most wonderful cottage which that part of the world had ever seen; and no one who remem- bered the quiet and rather sleepy bachelor in the city would have recognized, in the lively, active individual bustling around his farm, the same man. With something to think of and something to do he grew younger and handsomer every day, and the Bachelor's Hall, as it was called, became quite a noted place- until one fine, bright, spring morning, a year after the house was built, it ceased to be a bachelor's hall by the interposition of a mystic rite sometimes called a 'wedding. But I anticipate. I wish to give one of the bache- lor's letters to Doctor Lorton while he was still a ,  .          \   '     320    Romance of the Table. bachelor, and that will prove to my readers that, if Mr. Magnum did not turn out to be a poet after a rhyming fashion, the country came so near making him one that the world may almost lament the fact that he stopped short of real poetic achievements: "Dear Doctor: "I am exceedingly glad to hear that you are coming to see us all soon, perhaps next week, you say. I wish you were here now; the country is so beautiful and the hay so sweet that it seems a pity to lose a single breath of air, or a single one of our glorious sunsets. The Mayhews are well, and Florence is improving daily. They are wonderfully affectionate, and if I thought I could be half so good or so happy as they are I would marry to-morrow, if any one-and espec- ially one I have in my eye-would have me, of which I am in considerable doubt. "You ask me how I get along with my farming, and I answer that I don't brag. I took a sudden notion to fix up an old farm-house on the place, so as to be near my operations while building. Aunt Tidy is with me, and we are, at least, comfortable. "I am not much of a farmer, and that may be the reason why I sometimes see and enjoy things which ordinary plodding farmers do not. I wish they were not quite so plodding-that they looked more upward, and around them, than they are in the habit of doing; that they read more books, and looked as well upon the poetic as the prosy side of Nature. "I wonder why citizens, too, who must go to the country, or think they must, defer their goingr until the country-if not an arid desert-looks very much i  t   Aunt Tidy and the Chickens.    321 like a shorn sheep; until the odorous grasses and the golden wheat are safely stowed away in prosaic barns. I have some friends coming soon, but not until that turn in the affairs of time when the increasing heat and the shortening days show the dog-star to be in the ascendant; not until, for the nonce, the poetry of Nature is utterly burned up and done for. I thought of those parboiled citizens, this morning, as I rested within the shadow of a hay-fork handle and watched the falling grass-falling beneath the short, singing strokes of that most wonderful of farm implements, the mowing-machine. There was a poem written in that evenly cut and neatly laid greensward, and the. music of the machine furnished an appropriate melody, more refreshing to the farmer's soul than the symphonies of Beethoven or Mozart; and the hymn and the incense came together. "Do you, dear Doctor, know anything of the real odor of new-mown hay? Do you think you can buy it at the perfumer's? Are you so lamentably ignorant as to suppose Phalon has it on a shelf, with his melange of soaps, hair-oils and pomatums? And you are. coming to the country next week! Alas for you! The grass will not lie there, speckled with the daisies, breathing out its life in riplets of odor, wooing you by its sweetness, and lifting you upward by such potent spells as only Nature thus can. exercise. Conie, if you will, when the patient earth is parched by the heat; when the dust covers the herbage, and dry leaves fill the paths; when Mooley, the cow, stands up to her knees in the pond to escape the flies, and all the world is panting and perspiring. You will vote the country a bore, no doubt, and wish yourself back 21     322     Romance of the Table. again behind the bricks and mortar, while I shall feel refreshed by the memories of June and the music and poetry of the clover-fields. "But, talking of Mooley, did you ever make a pet of a calf? I don't mean one in Byron collars and boots from Brooks', but a little beauty of a ruminator, such as you will find in a little pen behind the barn. There are two, calling loudly to all passers, and speaking pleadingly with their great, luminous eyes. It is not so easy to make even a calf forget the mater- nal fount; and Bessie insisted, for a long while, on the substitute of a finger in the milk before she would be reconciled to her supper in a pail. Bessie's compan- ion, some three weeks her senior, is' a stout, lusty mademoiselle, of a fiery red, with horns just budding from her osfrontis. Bessie one evening was enjoying her repast, when her friend, having more quickly emptied her own pail, unceremoniously gave Bessie a shove, and in an instant her own nose was in the lacteal fluid. You imagine, no doubt, that Bessie instituted at once very vigorous reprisals. Not so, but, with a brilliant calf idea in her mind that there must be a conduit between her companion's mouth and ear, she seized upon the latter organ, and sucked that until the pail was empty. "Then, there is poetry even in the chicken yard. We have a motherly hen, which has adopted a brood of ten ducks in addition to her own dozen legitimate chicks. But web-footed children are ungrateful as others; for I have noticed that the ducklings care very little for their foster-mother during the day, wander ing off as they please, gobbling up everything within   Aunt Tidy and the Chickens.    323 reach, but quite willing to return to the sheltering wings of the hen at night. "And ducks do gobble at a fearful rate. The pig is considered the most fitting emblem of gluttony; but when you have raised ducks you will change your opinion. I have known pigs to give out, exhausted, while eating; but I never knew a duck to refuse to swallow while food was within reach. I mean to make an experiment, and see what the real cost of a pair of roasting-ducks is. With a couple of score on hand I am, at times, haunted with the idea that all my earthly goods are surely traveling down their insatiate maws. "Here, in a basket, however, is a pure little bit of chicken poetry; a little romance which, if chickens could write, would be at once elaborated in a volume from the press of a chicken Lippincott. "On all farms there will be, at times, motherless peepers and paupers, appealing to our hearts and baskets of crumbs; but it is not often that they find- such a motherly and sympathetic heart as in Aunt Tidy. When, with the first peep of day, Aunty opens the door, she is greeted with a storm of applause that would send a Presidential candidate to a politician's heaven. Ducks and chickens all know her, and even the rooster forgets his dignity and gives a quiet chuckle of delight. I "One day Aunt Tidy found and cared for a motherless chick, and gave it entire possession of a basket. It grew and thrived, as a matter of course, and somehow it seems to pattern after its sedate and respected foster-mother; a steady, quiet little chick with a voice so soft and mild, as though afraid of     324     Romance of the Table. disturbing some one's meditations. When about three weeks old, another chicken-which had prema- turely come into the world before its brothers and sisters-needed attention, and for convenience was placed in the same basket with number one. With the instinct of nature, so strong in all, the little fledgling crept under the wing of its companion, which not only made no objection, but kindly extended to it all the care and protection the case permitted; doing the 'hovering' from that time forward with a matronly dignity and a little peep of welcome that was quite touching. The two became inseparable, and the little mother, as she was dubbed, developed into as active a bug-hunter as any farmer could desire. "In about two weeks from the date of this compact two more newly hatched chicks needed temporary protection, and, merely out of curiosity as to the result, they were placed in the basket to which the other pets came regularly at night. To the surprise of all, no objection was made to this inqrease of the family, but the quiet, old-maidish little mother did the best she could 'under the circumstances,' and, herself yet but a little chicken, extended her little wings almost in a straight line, that the last petitioning little peepers might have a share in her downy breast. And not only this, but, with a premature development of intellect (call it instinct, if you wish), she endeav- ored to make a nest and add to the comforts of her little ones by arranging the straws in systematic order. "In a day or two the mother of the last chicks was ready to receive her children back, and they were given to her; but they knew no mother now but the little mother, and declined staying. So, since that   Aunt Tidy and the Chickens.    325 day, the family party of four-a party worthy of a chromo-has been intact, and a more industrious brood has never been known. With no objection to a substantial meal, which the chickens will take from your hand or in your lap, they work the livelong day as thoughthey had come into the world especially to earn their own living. They watch the luscious mulberries as they drop from the tree-and woe be to the bug or worm within reach of their tiny bills. When their little mother rests during the day, small heads will be seen peeping from between her wings and body; although, from the limited nature of the accommodations, it often happens that a head will go in one side and almost instantly emerge from the other. At eventide they come to the door of the dining-room to be fed and petted, and as the shadows fall upon the earth they seek the basket; and with mutual 'peeps' of comfort and welcome they prob- ably sink into virtuous dreams of coming bugs and bread-crumbs. "Come when you will, however, Doctor, dear. If you don't smell the hay in the field you can in the barn, and your welcome will always be hearty. "Ever yours,   W. M." -     CHAPTER IV.

As a rule, in the country, people are very much given to assimilate according to their tendencies of mind or general circumstances in life. The rich associate with the rich; people of the same religious faith flock together; those who play cards and other games are sure to find each other out; and the plain, neighborly farmers, at least, look over' ie fences at each other and talk-crops. On Sunday there is a sedate procession to the various places of worship, and through the week minor gatherings for various purposes; but stay-at-home is the system most prac- ticed, and there is a state of existence, divided between hard labor and sleep, savoring very little of the poet- ical, and offering but poor material for the writer of either fact or fiction. Mayhew and Florence made considerable exertions, at first, to become acquainted with the people around them. They called on others, and invited others to call on them. They made little tea-parties, and joined sewing and literary societies; they went to the different churches, so as not to appear " distant," and loaned their books to youthful readers. They were   Burnished Gold.       327 as polite to the poor as to the rich; in fact, they did not court the society of the latter at all. "If our rich neighbors," said Thomas, "wish our society, they can come and tell us so." In a few years they had established themselves on a very good footing. The people around them were shy. They were not much accustomed to city folks, and were a little suspicious, perhaps, that they were being "patronized." They did not like, either, being drawn from their accustomed track. It is not easy to awaken new emotions in people, or stir up the fires which had quietly smouldered since their youth. The young people were quite willing to be entertained, and many tried their best to entertain others; but with indifferent success. It was less a labor to get them together than to "bring them out," as we say, when once in the fold. There is, too, a good deal of sameness in the coun- try. People's intellects are run in a tolerably uniform mould, and this is confirmed by the uniformity of occupation. When one farmer is cutting grass they are all cutting grass; when one is cradling grain they are all cradling grain, and they naturally think' and talk of that which for the time most occupies their attention. The weather is a universal object of solic- itude; the crops come next, and then the markets. There are few more intelligent men, perhaps, than the American farmers; but it is hard to get their intelli- gence to bear upon other interests than those which immediately concern them. They are great readers, however, and in warm party conflicts great and earn- est politicians. They are sincere lovers of their coun- try, and are very earnestly opposed to taxation. Such     328     Romance of the Table. were the elements which Thomas and Florence founa about them, and with which they endeavored to unite. Once in a while they came across an original spec- imen of humanity-a sort of learned blacksmith, study- ing while still laboring at his forge. There were men as keen as lawyers in a debate, who had very little education, except what they had borrowed from books, or learned from contact with the world. They would have made statesmen had they the opportunity; as it was, they exercised their strong common sense in electing them, when they had the privilege. They were liberal, too, in their own way. Not habit- uate to new-fangled improvements, they adhered to the customs of their fathers. It was hard work to get them to repair a school-house, or engage any but the cheapest teachers; yet they would contribute liberally to make up the losses of a poor neighbor whose barn had been burned, or whose cow or horse had died, and whose wife and children might be suffering. They would come but shyly into a house unbidden; yet, if called upon in a case-of sickness or death, they would fly as the winged messenger is supposed to fly to the relief of repentant sinners. Here is the gold of humanity unburnished. The gold that the artificer works deftly into beaute- ous forms is small in quantity, compared with what is left in the mines; and it is so with the great mass of the world. There is plenty of good material, but it needs to be fashioned and polished to give it high value. So, as the goldsmith moulds and fashions the pliant metal, crystallizing, as it were, the inventive genius of his brain-bringing into existence ornaments and jewels, rarely set, which princes may long for and.   Burnished Gold.      329 envy-so is it in the work-shop of the Great Artificer of the Universe. From thence issues the burnished gold: the model man and womnan of every age and period, who, in word and deed, say to the rest of the world," Come up higher!"And, to the wonder of many, our bachelor friend-he whose quiet naps in the arm- chair and good-natured sallies when awake showed unalloyed good-nature, but no aim in life beyond quiet and ease-had become such a changed man that even Mayhew, who knew him better than any one else, was astonished with the rest. Yes, that man was the bachelor, now a bachelor no longer, for Ada had taken pity upon his forlorn con- dition, and was the mistress of the new house; but his friends, at leash, said they were so used to calling him thus that they could not help it. i And he loved to be called the bachelor-being, as he remarked, the favorite pet name by which he was first known to Ada; and he insisted upon it that he was the only bachelor ever married who remained a bach- elor still. Some wives try to break their husbands of any peculiar habits, whims or fancies; Ada never did. If Mr. Magnum was changed, therefore-and externally he was almost the same-it was owing to the development of some qualities of heart or mind which had before lain dormant, stimulated, no doubt, by Ada, but not created by her. "O, you dear old fellow!" said Ada to her husband, one day. "I saw you hitch up the horse and go off to the village; what could you want in such a hurry?" "Only some nails, dear, to mend a few things with. It's a wet day, you know, love; and it's so dull to have nothing on hand to do."     330     Romance of the Table. Ada was full of her old, mischievous ways, and so she took her husband by both ears and looked him right in the eye, with a merry twinkle in both of hers. "Well, it is quite a singular coincidence, Will, that poor old Aunty Herbert should have passed just before you started, lugging her basket in one hand and carrying her umbrella in the other." Will turned red, and then said: "I did pick her up, dear, that's so, now you remind me of it; but you would not have me pass her on the road, would you?" "Certainly not, dear; but why have you your gown and slippers on? I thought you were going to work in the shop!" "I have altered my mind, dear, and want to read something to you, while you are mending my gloves." "Well, sit down by me, and tell me what is the matter with Widow Remson's little boy?" "He has hip disease, the result of a fall, some years ago. Poor little fellow; he looks at me with his great, bright eyes so lovingly, and hobbles out to meet me as soon as he hears my footstep on the pavement. His ma says he was so fretful and peevish before I called there, and now he is as gentle as a kitten." "Of course he is, dear. What child ever did, or could, resist the influence of your magnetism, or the sphere of love you throw around every one." "No, no, darling Ada, it is not t at; it's all because I read to him, and taught him to play back-ganm- mon  "          / "And gave him the board!"  "Well, dear, how could he havelearned if I had not done so?" "And what did you read to him, pet?"   Burnished Gold.       331 "Oh! Ada, it is so singular The boy seemed to nave no fancy for common stories, so I got a volume of Goldsmith, and he was delighted. After that I took up Charles Lamb, and he seemed never to tire of the quaint essays and gentle satires of that lovable writer. I believe he drank it all in, and his mind  changed into a likeness of the author. He seems to be-with the drawhack of being a boy-the likeness of Rosamond Gray, one of Lamb's creations- "'Young and artless and innocent, meaning no harm and thinking none; affectionate as a smiling infant-playful, yet unobtrusive as a weaned lalpb-everybody loved her. Young Allan Clare, when but a boy, sighed for her.'" Ada listened, and smiled with the tears in her eyes. William Magnum had a singularly genial disposi- tion, and the active life of the country brought into exercise every faculty of his mind. He was no soon- er fairly settled than he made friends with every living thing. First he began with the birds, and, by dint of building houses and scattering crumbs when- ever he went out, he was soon followed by a feath- ered army. Then he followed suit with the children. He did not treat them to sugar-plums and cakes; but he mingled with them in their plays, and was famous for botanical and geological researches on Saturday afternoons-and there was sure to be a lunch basket in company He always had a book in his pocket, too, and he was never long without an audience, if he wanted one. The bachelor would not go to the war-not he. He could not kill a fly, much less a man. There was no lacking of patriotic feelings and instincts; but, talk as we may of both, the bachelor would not fight.     332     Romance of the Table. There were hints of cowardice. The bachelor smiled, and said, "Yes, he was a coward." Yet for years he was one of the few who could be called upon, in an emer- gency, to face death in worse forms than through cannon-balls and rifle-bullets. The child of one of his traducers was seized with small-pox; the neigh- bors fled in dismay-all but Will Magnum, who nursed the child through, as tenderly as though it were his own. There was a caving in of a railroad embankment, one day, and two poor laborers were killed. Will not only helped to extricate the bodies, but he did more-he supported both families until the widows and children were so employed that they needed n'o further help. And everything that Will did was done so quietly it did not seem as though he was conscious of his own acts. There is a natural way of being good, just as there is a natural way of walking, eating, talking, sleeping; and the bachelor dropped into it as quietly as a child to its rest. "Isn't this glorious!"Will said to his wife, one summer afternoon, as he sat upon the horse-block in front of his door. "Is not this glorious--to be able to have nothing to do?" Will had just come from assisting a neighbor whose palsied limbs prevented him from working-at least but lightly. Isn't it delightful to have nothing to do? Will Magnum, the bachelor, was the burnished gold.   CIAPTER     V. THE VILLAGE CHURCH AND THE PARSONS. The Sundays of man's life, Threaded together on Time's string, Make bracelets to adorn the wife Of the eternal, glorious king. On Sundays Heaven's gate stands ope; Blessings are plentiful and rife- More plentiful than hope.-George HTerber Names are sometimes very badly chosen, and some-. times they harmonize very charmingly with the owner; but I do not believe a name and an owner ever agreed more charmingly than did Rosabel May, the bit of sunshine that peeped, one merry summer morning, from the little oriel window of the little parsonage which stood in the middle of a little rose garden in the little village of Avon. I believe I have said, in some one of the more learned chapters of this work, that an animal repre- sents so many tons of hay and corn, or something of that sort; and Rosabel represented, to my philosophic eyes, a dozen rainbows, a half ton of violets, a score of zephyrs laden with sweets from the garden, and at least a hundred varieties of the sweetest song-birds which ever made the air tremble with their melodies. Show me the softest sunshine which peeps over the hills on a June morning, playing bo-peep with the dew on a rosebud, and you have Rosabel May. I could not describe her better were you to give me a million.     334     Romance of the Table. The father of Rosabel May was a widower, and had been from the birth of his only daughter; so that Rosabel never knew a mother's love. Mrs. May, it is said, was a mild, sweet-voiced little woman, who be- lieved everything her husband said was truth, and everything her husband did was right, as the wife of a minister should; but if Rosabel took after her mother, she certainly did not after her father, who, at the time of which I write, was a sober, straight-laced, old-fash- ioned- disciple of Calvin, and had quite as strong a hatred of heresy and schismatics as the Pope himself. In fact, he was just at that time preparing a course of twelve lectures on predestination, with which he intended to overwhelm and confound a liberal young parson who had just set up his tabernacle in the vil- lage of Avon. To say that the Reverend Mr. May was shocked is but a mild expression of his state of mind. The Rev- erend Pleasanton Primrose had called upon Mr. May on his first becoming a denizen of Avon. He had eaten of his salt, and drank of the tea served out by the fairy hand of Rosabel; but-oh, unfortunate Mr. Primrose!-in a fit of exuberant happiness and tempo- rary forgetfulness, he had ventured to set forth such liberal views in regard to Christianity as to give almost every sinner a prospect of future bliss. Per- haps Mr. Primrose did not adhere very closely to his Church creeds, and followed only his own happy impulses, which were broad and deep enough to save anybody, especially while drinking Rosabel's tea; but the Reverend Mr. May did not see the matter in the same light. He had been so much in the habit of squeezing every man into Paradise by the skin of his   The Village Church and Parsons.   335 teeth, to use a homely saying, that he could'not but be deeply shocked at the idea of having the gates thrown open so widely. And this latitude of theological views led to a more narrow and contracted view of future rewards and punishments. He was a conscientious man, was the Reverend Mr. May, and he truly believed that he held in his hands the immortal destinies of the honest citizens of Avon. He had been so long there, too, that he considered he had a sort of pre-emption right to take the parish Heavenward. The predecessor of Mr. Plrimrose was a man after his own heart, and the two had jogged along very comfortably, until one. jogged off the path of life into the churchyard, leaving Mr. May with an increased measure of responsibility. Mr. Primrose was the choice to the succession of the younger part of the congregation of the deceased minister. The people, in fact, were generally in favor of a change from age to youth; and when Mr. Primrose accepted the call there was a buzzing like that in a hive in the spring among the good people of the vil- lage to whose spiritual wants he was to minister. The church was newly painted, and boasted of new carpets and a pulpit cushion. The parsonage was freshy decorated and furnished, and the garden, which had gone to weeds, put on such a summer appearance that the birds came around as plentiful as blackberries. To say that every young lady came out in spring attire, and that every young gentleman had a new hat, when the Reverend Mr. Primrose preached his first sermon, is only to say what occurs in every country village on the arrival of a new parson, especially if he is young and good-looking     336     Romance of the Table. But, after the tea at Mr. May's, the latter gentleman treated his clerical brother with a great deal of polite- ness, and at the same time with much formality. Mr. Primrose was grieved and vbxed. In the innocence of his heart he had thought only to please his, host, and he was surprised at the result. There was a very pleasant vision in his eye, too; and a very white hand, with a teacup in it, was rather oftener before him than it should have been, the gravity of his profession considered. It was a very fragrant June morning, when Rosabel and Dr. May were taking their morn- ing meal. The window was up, and the lilac bushes sent in their heavy perfume, dashed with the honey- suckle blossoms which clustered around the window. The breakfast was simple-toast and milk, coffee, eggs, radishes, and butter which rivaled the rose in fragrance. Very plain in their food were Dr. May and his daughter. "I very much fear that the new minister will lead the people astray, Rosabel," said Dr. May, and he thoughtfully stirred the sugar in his coffee, and broke an egg at the little end. "I believe he is drawing out a great many new peo- ple," replied Rosabel. "They say he is popular, and that his church is crowded every Sabbath." "But old Mr. Cashus," returned the father, "assured me that Mr Primrose had not preached a doctrinal sermon since his installation. He makes everything in religion depend on love, and he says nothing about the righteous retribution of the wicked. The people do not, absolutely, know what he believes." "That is a pity," said Rosabel, mirsingly; "and, I remember, Mrs. Moses told me she did not know   The zillage Church and Parsons.  337 whether he was filled with the Spirit-he was so young a man; but one day, soon after he arrived, Mrs. Moses' youngest child was seized with convul- sions, and, the Doctor being out, they sent for the min- ister, and he seemed to know just as much; and he stayed all night and until the child was entirely out of danger." "Oh! he is very kind-hearted, I doubt not," replied the father; " but in our sacred profession sin cannot be cured with kindness solely; we must denounce it- cauterize it-exterminate it. The soul surfeits of sweets, and demands more solid nutriment. Now, if Mr. Primrose would only marry a good, steady woman, older than himself, he would, no doubt, be less given to looking forever on the pleasant side of religion-but give me another cup of coffee, my dear!"  Rosabel took the cup abstractedly, and returned it to her father, filled. "He has not been here, lately, Rosabe?" "No, father." "I think I must ask him to my study, some morn- ing, and test his knowledge on vital religious doc- trine," and Dr. May lifted the cup to his lips. "Bless me! child, what have you given me?" cried the worthy father, as he looked into his cup. "Cold milk and sugar!" Rosabel blushed, and stammered: "Indeed, father, I believe I left out the coffee!" and she hastily filled another cup and handed it to her parent. "And this time," said Dr. May, employing his spoon on a voyage of discovery, " you have left out the sugar!" "I am getting short-sighted, I think," said the young lady, passing the bowl. 22     338     Romance of the Table. "Short-minded, you should say," replied her father. "But it is quite true, my dear. No young, unmarried man can have a proper appreciation of the duties of his office. I shall deliver my third lecture this even- ing. I wish Mr. Primrose could hear it." It was not long after this that Dr. May had a severe attack of rheumatism. His head was clear, but his physical understanding was weak. He hastily called his vestrymen together, and showed the impossibility of his preaching on the following Sabbath. "Dr. Thompson, of Springtown, has an assistant," said he; "perhaps you had better ask him." So Dr. Thompson was sent for, and kindly consented to officiate for his afflicted brother the following Sab- bath; but Dr. Thompson was very absent-minded, even worse than Rosabel at the breakfast-table; and, driving over to Avon in his old gig, he abstractedly hitched his horse at the post in front of the meeting- house of Mr. Primrose, and then solemnly and stiffly walked up the aisle, and entered the pulpit. It was early; the sexton was just beginning to toll the bell in that mournful cadence which is a hint to laggards. Mr. Primrose issued from the door of his bachelor parsonage, and stood for a moment in calm contemplation of the quiet, orderly procession, form- ing and breaking as the roa1s led to the several churches, when he noticed one of his own deacons walking with a gait which was altogether too rapid and unseemly for such a peaceful Sabbath morning. The deacon's eyes were excited, and his face red with the unwonted exercise; and the stout little man, whose motions were much after the pattern of a duck coming after a late breakfast, was aiming at the parsonage.   The Village Church and Parsons.   339 The young pastor was alarmed, and his active brain was filled with quick suggestions. Fire!-no; that could not be it. Sudden illness of Bangup, the rich- est man in the congregation - But before even these ideas were safely turned, the gasping deacon was at the step. "Mr. Primrose! Mr. Primrose!" whispered the dea- con (he had not voice enough left for a full tone)- "have you invited Dr. Thompson to preach for vou this morning?" Mr. Primrose was too astonished to reply, and be- fore he could get his lips together another deacon from Dr. May's church came up from an opposite direction, also panting after a very undignified manner. "Mr. Primrose! Mr. Primrose!" cried the new ar- rival, "haveyou engaged Mr. Thompson to preach for you to-day?" The Reverend Mr. Primrose looked from one dea. con to the other in astonishment.- "I engage Mr. Thompson! Why should I engage Mr. Thompson, pray?" "But he is in your pulpit!" said the first deacon. "I know he is!" gasped the second deacon. "The bell has stopped tolling, and by this time he is giving out the hymn!" cried deacon number one. "What is to be done?" whimpered the deacon from Mr. May's; "we have no minister at all!" Mr. Primrose was thunderstruck. He had heard neither of Mr. May's illness, nor of the engagement of Reverend Mr. Thompson; and the idea of the latter gentleman being there, in his pulpit, struck him as so ridiculous that, with all his perplexity, he could not help smiling.     340     Roiance of the Table. "There is only one thing to be done," said the dea- con from Mr. May's church, with suddenly-recovered energy. "You must go and preach for us!" This was a startling proposition, and all Mr. Prim- rose's mirthfulness vanished in a moment. What! he preach in the pulpit of that great moral thunderbolt --Mr. May! It was wrong, too, to thus intrude, with- out the permission of that reverend Doctor of Divin- ity. The dilemma was frightful! Both churches were full, and one congregation was waiting in won- derment for a shepherd. "Go!" said his own deacon. "Come!" said the other deacon. I will," exclaimed Mr. Primrose, in a husky voice. "The way is not clear, but I will put my trust in the Lord." "Quick!" cried the deacon from Mr. May's, in a voice of agony. A bright thought struck Mr. Primrose, and, turning, he rushed into the house, mounted the stairs three at a time to his study, turned over a pile of manuscripts, seized one, stuffed it into his pocket and descended again to the road. "I am ready," said Mr. Primrose; and with agile steps the young minister followed the almost crazy deacon to the porch of Dr. May's church. We may be sure that there was a rustling of silks and a hum of voices as the young minister walked up the aisle to the pulpit and, with all the gravity he could command, ascended the steps. An apparition would hardly have created more surprise than Mr. Primrose did in that congregation.   The Village Church and Parsons.    341 Giving out the first hymn as quickly as possible, the new minister sat down to wipe his flushed face and collect his scattered thoughts; and it was quite necessary-for in the minister's pew sat that compound of violets and sunbeams, Rosabel May. Poor Mr. Primrose had had enough to shock his nerves, without the full, liquid light of that pair of eyes-askinggvery moment, too, what he was doing there. It was rather a relief to him to engage in the first prayer, for he could, at least, shut his eyes and, in abstraction of thought, endeavor to compose himself for the trial before him. After the prayer Mr. Primrose felt more composed, and, in fact, he began to recall some of his old pulpit strength and enthusiasm. The sermon he had so hastily selectly had been preached once before, on the death of a child, and he trusted to his adroitness to adapt it, as he proceeded, to the present emergency. Perhaps the reader may know why Mr. Primrose se- lected this particular sermon, from the text: "' By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus."' The sermon was one of those beautiful efforts which a loving heart can make when inspired by the tender- ness of childhood, chastened by the hand of affliction and guided by the faith of religion. The congrega- tion listened in pleased surprise, and with an attention which showed that the speaker held their hearts in his hand. It was so fresh to many of them, too. Nobody ever ventured to question the genuineness of Mr. May's religious doctrines. His faith was undoubted- ly that delivered to the Saints, but he was past the en- thusiasm of youth, and was scanty in those rhetorical     342     Romance of the Table. metaphors in which youth is apt to indulge. Mr. Primrose was a lover of the beautiful, and every sen- flowing out from the throne in a plenteous stream; while Mr. May's habit was to consider religious truth as a great mystery, logical rather than lovely. God, with him, was a King; with Mr. Primrose, a Father -that is the difference. Shall I say that Rosabel listened? No; I will not thus insult the intelligence of my young readers--tley know that Rosabel listened; listened until her eyes shone like diamonds-perhaps there was a tear in each of them. Of that, those same young readers can tell as well as I.   CHAPTER VI. "ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL" (NOT AFTER SHAKE' SPEARE).

There were other listeners,that day, besides Rosabel May-a good many listeners; but none who were more delighted than Thomas Mayhew, Florence, Wil liam Magnum and Ada. They had heard Mr. Prim- rose before, and were very much pleased with him, but to-day they had agreed to listen to the admoni. tion ot Mr. May. Great was their surprise, then when they saw Mr Primrose enter the pulpit. Aftel the service Thomas said to his wife: "Florence, dear, we must cultivate the acquaintance of the young minister-he is uncommonly talented.' "And uncommonly good," replied Florence, " if we may judge from his language and method of expres. sion." "Yes, there is hardly a doubt of it. He seemed tc feel the sermon to-day quite as'much as his audience. And he used hs notes much less frequently than usual, seemingly carried away with his subject. I am almost inclined to believe that he has met with the     344    Romance of the Table. loss of some dear young friend, perhaps relative, he so often touched upon the innocence of children." "Why can't we have him to tea?" inquired Florence. "We can," said Thomas; and let us call on Mr. May also, and ask him and his daughter." "Excelsior!" said Magnum; "and Ada shall come over and make the genuine, orthodox tea-biscuit." So that was agreed upon; but now let us see what was the result of the blunder of poor Mr. Thompson, who preached away to the bewildered congregation, two-thirds of whom imagined that something had happened to their minister; not a small number being prepared to hear that he had had a fit, and had tum- bled down the well, or into the kitchen fire. A few who had seen him at his own door before the service had not the slightest doubt but he had broken his neck immediately afterward, although how a new minister had been so rapidly obtained, puzzled them not a little. The deacon who had conveyed the information to Mr. Primrose of the occupation of his pulpit by Mr. Thompson was one of a very limited number who understood the matter thoroughly and were ready to make explanations both to the congregation, as far as the people could be reached, and to Mr. Thompson. The latter was the more difficult matter of the two, and when the reverend gentleman understood what he had done he was overwhelmed with confusion. "Dear! dear! What a blunder!" said the good Dr. Thompson. What will Mr. May say to me? He will never forgive my stupidity! And what apology shall I make to Mr. Primrose for thus turning him out of his pulpit?"   All's Well that Ends Well.    345 Mr. Primrose had hurried back to his church imme- diately after the service; and, understanding the dilemma of the unfortunate minister, hastened to assure him of his entire forgiveness. In fact, by this time Mr. Primrose was more than willing to forgive the entire world, and grant every body unqualified absolution. The novelty of his position, the newness of his audience, and the rosy face of Rosabel, had driven very thoroughly away any misgivings he had previously had in regard to the propriety of what he had done. He shook hands with Mr. Thompson en- ergetically, and assured him he was the most delighted man in the world, and he might make the same mis- take every time he was invited to preach in Avon, if he chose to do so.  Mr. May, however, was not in quite so amiable a temper. His rheumatism had given him some sharp twinges that morning, and he awaited the appearance of Mr. Thompson with some acerbity of mind. He was not quite sure of anybody's orthodoxy but his own, and was anxious to know what subject the sub- stitute had chosen, and in what way it had been handled. Rosabel came in, smiling and happy. "O papa," exclaimed she, in quite a transport; "O papa, we had such a beautiful discourse!"I "I am glad to hear it, my dear; what was Mr. Thompson's subject?" "Mr. Thompson, papa?" "Exactly--my dear-Mr. Thompson! What did Mr. Thompson preach about?" Rosabel was-confused; and then, like all young ladies who are confused, she stammered, turned red and white by turns, and ended as she had begun.     346     Romance of the Table. "Mr. Thompson, papa?" "What is the matter, my daughter, and where is the minister? Why did he not come home with you to dinner?" "Mr. Thompson did not preach, papa!" "I am amazed!" exclaimed Mr. May. "Who did preach, then, if he did not?" "Mr. Primrose, papa!" "In my pulpit!" said Mr. May, in astonishment; and he got up from his easy chair, and trotted about the room, totally oblivious of his rheumatism. "Mr. Primrose in my pulpit! How came he there, pray?" "I do not know, papa," said Rosabel, softly. "Isup- posed it was some arrangement of yours, but "-and Rosabel spoke with a good deal of enthusiasm, for her--"Mr. Primrose preached a beautiful sermon, and it was all about faith; and I am sure what hesaid was true, for he quoted ever so much Scripture, and I saw some of the people crying," and Rosabel began to sled tears herself in sympathy with her remem- brances. At this moment there was a large arrival at Mr. May's front door-Mr. Thompson, escorted by the deacons of both churches. They pitied the embarrass- ment of the minister, and, knowing Mr. May's pecu- liarities, had determined to take him by storm and force of numbers. Mr. May was still in a fog, of course, for Rosabel had not unvailed the mystery. He was astonished to see Mr. Thompson. How came he here, and yet not preach as per agreement? "You see before you an unfortunate, if not a cul- pable, individual," said Mr. Thompson. "In a state of temporary absent-mindedness, I made a blunder and   All's Well that Ends Well.    547 got into Mr. Primrose's pulpit instead of yours. Had he been there I should have rectified the error in season, but I gave out the hymn rather promptly; and, in the meantime, Mr. Primrose was induced to fill my engagement with you." "Very reluctantly on his part," said a deacon, " for he felt that you might consider it an intrusion; but there seemed no help for it. The time was past the hour; the people were waiting .--. " "And the Lord seemed to guide us," chimed in the deacon who first made the sortie on Mr. Primrose. "And it was a very sound, evangelical discourse!" said a third deacon. "Very sound and orthodox!" exclaimed a fourth. "And the people were greatly edified!" cried a fifth. "The text was from Acts iv., 30," cried a sixth: "'By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and w inders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.'" "Indeed," piously ejaculated the Reverend Mr. Thompson, "I hope the error will be productive of great good. We are forced, after all, through our own faith, to believe that every thing is wisely ordered by the Lord. If it was His will that I should get into the wrong pulpit, it may all he ordered for His glory and the extension of His Kingdom." Mr. May was mollified. There was no gainsaying that the truth was uttered by his reverend brothers, and so, with a return of his really dignified graciousness of manner, he shook hands with his well-meaning friend and the deacons, and expressed his concurrence in what had been done. "I do not see how, under the circumstances, you could well have done differently," said Mr. May. I     348    iRomance of the Table. was only fearful that, with the giddiness of youth, Mr. Primrose might have been led to enunciate doctrines which my people have not been accustomed to hear. If you are sure he has not done that, I shall return my thanks for his kindness, and we will say nothing more about it." So the company separated, leaving the two minis- ters to discuss a cold joint, and compare notes on theology. Rosabel was very happy with the happy ending of the trouble, and presided with more than her wonted grace at the table. "It is not good for man to be alone," sighed, rather than spoke, the Reverend Mr. Primrose, over his cold joint at the other parsonage, /   CHAPTER VII. COUNTRY KITCHENS AND COUNTRY STABLES.

Irish girls prefer cities, and American girls will rarely go to service without they are made a part of the family. Tlhen there is the difficulty in being suited. The girls may not like the mistress; the latter may not like the cooking, and the master will storm over his badly washed and ironed linen. So there is a chorus of wails set up, and people worry through the hot sum- mer only too glad when it is over, and they can again liave all the conveniences and comforts of the city. Blessed are those who can carry with them the easy independence which accompanies self-reliance; hap- py those who can make their own fires, and bake their own bread; and still happier those who on a hot sum-     350     Romance of the Table. mer day can sustain Nature on sweet bread and milk, and suci of the fruits and vegetables as may grow in their own gardens. And of this class were Thomas and Florence. Rose had married a well-to-do farmer, and was settled in her own little cottage as snugly as any good girl could desire, so that Florence was often subjected to the petty annoyances which I have referred to, and which are too common to need rehearsing. She never lost her philosophy or her good temper, how- ever. If the new "' help" did not answer, she did her own work, and Thomas declared that there was no feast equal to what his wife prepared with her own hands, even if the table held nothing but bread and butter, and strawherries. It was not often reduced as low as that. It was not at all difficult to boil pota- toes after Dr. Sollinger's style; nor to have a few sweet, crisp radishes, of which both were extrav- agantly fond; or some equally crisp lettuce, and an egg. Then eggs themselves were plentiful and wholesome. Berries in their season were brought to the door by the berry-brown country boys, who often worked to fill their pails that they might come within the reach of the pleasant smile and kindly words of Florence. They were often treated, besides, to a glass of milk and a piece of cake, and they looked with wondering eyes upon the little fairy land of which Florence seemed to be a guardian spirit, rather than a human being. Well, and was not a table so spread fit for a king? At least, if the king had a good appetite, and an un- perverted taste.

If they had kitchen help, it was well; if not, it was still well. Boys are much more easily found in the country than girls, and there was, in fact always a lively competition for a vacant place there, and the more that a vacancy was very rare. And boys were in many respects- far more helpful than girls. They could dig the potatoes, pull the radishes, bring in the wood, make the fires, and in a hundred ways make themselves useful, and boys do so love horses, cows and pigs, and every living thing about a farm. The pony was a never-ceasing wonder. His coat shone as though it were varnished, and he had- sly pony-discovered that in a certain large pocket lumps of sugar were occasionally to be found. Flor- ence's children, as soon as they could toddle, aimed straight for the stable, and stuck single spears of hay at the pony's mouth. Next to the pony came the cows, and the next best friend to a mother for a child is a cow. When the maternal fount is dry; when bad habits of living and worse habits of dressing separate the mother and the child in the tenderest of all relationships, then Moo- ley is sought for, and her treasure is more precious than diamonds and rubies. Her nursling often dies that ours may live. I don't know what to say about the pig, except that he is a necessity, or seemingly so. He is the scaven- ger. He turns his nose up at nothing, but down at everything. The constant accumulations of parings, buttermilk and the debris of the table, would be a great inconvenience but for him. As for his flesh, it is a matter of habit, of prejudice. Some never touch     352     Romance of the Table. it, others think it the most delicious of all meats. Ask a country boy his opinion of a nice, tender bit of pork, roasted with the well-browned beans, and you will find him a lad of very decided sentiments. Ask a farmer in the winter what mainly sustains his life, and he will tell you the pork barrel in the cellar. Ask others, who feast on choice cuts of beef, with a partialit for highly seasoned dishes, and their verdict will probably be of a different character. My own very moderate opinion is that we may eat too much, and that pork is a great deal better in the country than in the city. Fat pork, in cold weather, is very similar in its effects to Greenland blubber-it pro- duces a great deal of carbon, and keeps up the animal fires. Often would Thomas and Florence walk out by starlight, or moonlight, and see that all their dumb dependents were safe; that Billy, the pony, was secure in the stall; that the gate of the farm-yard did not give the cows free pasturage in the garden, and that no predatory weazle was on the look out for a pullet. And, as the eyes of night shone out from the liquid sky, and Heaven's arch seemed to bound their own sweet peaceful home, they stood in rapt and silent contemplation, too full of happiness to disturb the solemn stillness.

Fortune, if not lavish of her favors, had continued to smile on Thomas Mayhew. Mr. Williams had retired from active business, and had not only influ- enced much trade in behalf of the firm  in which Thomas was a partner, but he had become a silent partner himself; adding additional capital, but taking no active part in the business. He had done this entirely out of friendship for Thomas, and to enable him at once to obtain a full one-third interest in the profits. Gradually, too, as the effects of the war passed away, and the South began to assume its wonted prosperity, the trade the house formerly had in that section began to return, and new trade with it. Thomas made one more trip through the South- ern States, noting the effects of freedom upon the blacks, and the effect of altered social relations upon the whites. I have not the disposition to give the result of these investigations. The daily press is teeming with discussions, and the story of Thomas would be a tale more than twice told, by a thousand 23     354      Romance of the Table. times. He was satisfied that it needed but time, and the patient cultivation of kindly relations between ail the people of the Union, to bring a state of prosperity such as the country had never known. It was a bright but sultry day, in the early part of September, that Thomas received a note from Mr. Williams, reading as follows: My dear Mr. Mayliew : I wonder if you can find Mrs. Williams and myself a boarding place for a couple of months in Avori or its neighborhood. We have been to the sea-side, as you know, through the summer; but  we both have such vivid recollections of the beauties of Autumn in the mountains thb;t we feel quite in the humor for renewing our early joys. If it were not for fear of shocking your modesty, I should say thit the pleasure of being near you and your charm- ing wife is not among the smallest of our prospective expecta- tions. Faithfully yours, C. WILLIAMS. Thomas went home and consulted his wife. "Who is there," said he, "that has any vacant rooms that will suit them?" Florence laughed more heartily than was her wont. "Why do you try to deceive me, darling?    You know there is but one place for them to go, and that is here." "I was in hopes you would say so, Florence, but I wished to see whether it met with your full approval. It will entail more labor upon you than upon me, and I do not wish to tax you beyond your strength." "Thank you, my dear, but I should be a poor fife for a farmer if my strength was not equal to enter- taining such dear friends for a few weeks. I am delighted at the prospect; and, dear, you know Dr. Lorton is coming to pay Ada and William   a visit in September." /'      I    '.   Old Faces and New Friends.      355 "Yes," replied Thomas, and, as the Professor has a house only a few miles off, we can perhaps manage to have one or two of our old re-unions. Do you remember how pleasant they were?" "Yes, and how useful.  If we could only manage to get Dr. Sollinger here at the same time, we could go into the mysteries of life again." "I should like to know what Dr. Sollinger would say about Mabel Myrick, who is evidently consump- tive. Her parents are dreadfully worried about her, and think of spending the winter in Italy." "There will be a chance for the two schools to compare notes," said Florence. "I think Dr. Lorton has a very clear head, but Dr. Sollinger's practice may be more effective. Well, it is settled then, that Mr. and Mrs. Williams are to come here?" "I will at least give them the invitation." "Then sit right down and let me see what kind of a note you can write, for you know I have a personal interest in it." "Had you not better hold my hand, so that I will be sure to write straight?" "No, but I will look over it, to see that you cross all your t's, and dot your i's. Thomas sat down, and wrote as follows: Dear Mr. Williams: Your note came duly to,hand, and I, like a faithful husband, submitted it at once to my wife. She echoed my own thoughls completely in saying that there is but one house in Avon where you will be perfectly at home, and that is-our own. You must not refuse us, my dear friend. We are not wishful in this way to discharge our many obligations, but we ask you to take ups your abode with us for the sufficient reason that your company will be most agreeable to us, and help us to consummate a little plan--to bring together another re-union of the old elub. There will be no inconvenience; our house is quite deserted of visitors,     356     Romance of the Table. and we have very good help. If you wish to bring a servant, do so. She can assist us enough to compensate for what she will consume. Please accept this invitation as freely as it is given, and with- out ceremony. Let us know when you will come. Iy wife sends her love to yours. Ever truly yours, THos. MAYHEW. "That will do very well," said Florence, on reading. "You must have read my thoughts, for I could not have written differently." The letter was forwarded the next day, and brought Mr. Williams to Thomas' office. He did not hesitate to accept the proposition at once, with the simple understanding that, as he could not consent to go two months as a visitor, he should pay his board as he would anywhere else. To this Thomas demurred. He did not wish to consider Mr. Williams as a boarder. But a compro- mise was at last effected, by which each gentleman was to preserve his independence. Mr. Williams and his wife were not to go as boarders, but they were to contribute toward the support of the family by paying the weekly bills at the market. It was a glorious September evening when Mr. Williams and his wife made their appearance, in their own modest carriage, at the gate of Mayhew's cottage. There had been a shower. in the morning, laying the dust and clearing the atmosphere. The sun was setting, and the banks of fleecy clouds hanging sus- pended in the western and northern sky, glowing in gold and purple, presented an appearance as though the down had been stripped from the breasts of birds, and had been gathered together for the repose of all the Deities of mythology.   Old Faces and New Friends.    357 Thomas and Florence were at the gate to meet their friends, beaming with welcome smiles. The children, too, jumped with glee upon the piazza, for they had early learned to share in the anticipations and present joys of their parents. The dining-room window was open, affording a perspective of such a tablet as very few people take the pains to spread; a little bouquet at each plate, and that nameless some- thing in the entire arrangements which, like a woman arrayed with simplicity and grace, appeals to our sense of beauty, but furnishes us no words in which to express it. Poets have written for hun- dreds of years on the beauties of Nature without exhausting the subject, and I have often thought how closely allied humanity and Nature might be. The forest, close by Mayhew's house, merged itself grad- ually; into the maples and ornamental trees around the house, and they seemed to affiliate with the shrub- bery and flowers. Florence and her children were but animated portions of the rural picture, and the house with its honeysuckles and climbing roses had become identified with its surroundings. Then came the interior, with its brightly-papered walls, its charming pictures and engravings, its few well disposed exotics, and its multitudinous little com- forts; and, after all, looking at the forest, and travel- ing down by slow degrees to the tea-table, it did not require a great stretch of the imagination to fancy that a part of Nature, as well. So thought Mrs. Wil- liams, who exclaimed-"My dear Florence, I never realized I was in the country before!" It takes some people a long while to get "settled," as the phrase is. They do not feel at home. Every-     358     Romnwce of the Table. thing is new: scenery, house, beds and food. But Mr. and Mrs. Williams were at home at once; more than at home, in fact, for they felt immediately such a peace of mind, such a rest of the spirit, such entire freedom from care, that they wondered before the end of a week, whether they had not been there a month. Florence never labored over her work. There was such a clock-work svstem about all her movements that the duties of the day were apparently discharged without any remarkable effort, and there was always abundance of time in the afternoon for a walk, a drive, or for a pleasant talk upon the piazza, while waiting for Thomas to make his appearance from the city. At the end of the first week there was a pleasant little surprise for all except Thomas. He had planned it with no little industry and painstaking, and it was nothing more nor less than a gathering of the Club-every one who had any right to be called a member, at least. There were the bachelor and Ada, of course, for they were next-door neighbors. Then came the Professor and his wife, who were, as we have stated, near enough to be sent for when wanted. Vohlen, too, whose stories were well remembered, and who had never failed when he could be of service. Thomas' two partners, now grave and dignified mer- chants, somewhat past their prime, had been snugly stowed away at the hotel expressly for this occasion. It is a melancholy fact that Thomas was very nerv- ous that evening; that he spilled his milk, to the surprise of Florence, who had never known him to do such a thing before; that he sat down before supper was ready and got up before it was throigh;   Old Faces and New Friends.   359 that he lit the lamp in the parlor before it was dark, and insisted on bringing chairs from the dining-room when they were absolutely not wanted. Florence, at first surprised, was afterward amused, and began shrewdly to suspect that some play was to be enacted in which she had not been consulted; but she knew her husband would only be disappointed if she made any inquiry; so she prudently made herself invisible, and effected such changes in her attire as might prepare her for the event, whatever it might be. "And if," said Florence to herself: "And if I am called upon for a contribution, as possibly no one else may be prepared, I will surprise him;" and going .to her desk, she took therefrom a little manuscript, and placed it in her pocket. The shadows of a September evening had fairly deepened into night, when the entire party, marshaled at the hotel under the command of the bachelor, who was in all his glory, arrived at the cottage. Thomas tried to be astonished, but of course that was a failure. Florence was more successful; although there was a little mischief in her face which contradicted her outward expression. Dr. Sollinger's white head and rosy face bobbed around with a healthy glow which would have almost cured an invalid. The bachelor was everywhere, especially wher* a knot of neighbors, who had been kindly invited, but were comparative strangers to the company, needed his genial encouragement. "We won't call it a Club-meeting, to-night," said Florence, after an hour had been, passed in a perfect hum of conversation; " but, as we can remain together but a few days at the most,. I kope you will all drop     360     Romance of the Table. in every evening. Perhaps we can find something informal to talk about, and useful, as well. We will revive our ancient glories, even if, like the rocket, we die in mid-air." "But we must have something literary," said Vohlen, 'just to whet our appetites for what is to come hereafter." "I had a little talk with Mr. Williams," said Thomas, " and he promised, to-morrow night, to read a short paper as an introduction, which he calls a 'Chat over a cup of tea."' "We can all promise something for the future," said the bachelor; "and so we must ever be content with that feast of song and flow of sentiment which Florence extracts from the piano." "We will wind up with that," replied Florence, "and I am not anxious to have you go. You do not invite me to give you anything but music, but, if I add a trifle from the overrunning of my own good nature, you won't complain, will you?" "Oh no! Mrs. Mayhew! Oh no!" exclaimed a chorus of delighted voices. a .    CHAPTER IX. A CHAT OVER A CUP OF TEA. "Conceive them sitting tete-a-tete, Two cups-hot muffins on a plate-- With ' Anna's Urn' to hold hot water; The brazen vessel for a while Had lectured in an easy song, Like Abernethy-on the bile- The scalded herb was getting strong; All seemed as smooth as smooth could be, To have a cosy cup of tea. "-Ingoldsby Legends. I have had occasion to note the fact that the Eng- lish (I include ourselves) differ fromn all the rest of the world in the customs of the table, as well as in what is on the table, and the method of cooking. The tea table is with us a special institution. The effect of tea upon the nerves is undoubted, and ,we meet at the tea table to talk under its influence as much as the Chinese meet to gabble in their heathen fashion, while under the delicious influence of opium. Without people dine at a very early hour, they do not assemble at the evening meal to be fed, but merely to drink the celestial fluid, and talk; and, where late dining is the rule, as it is in England, the tea table is spread immediately after the dinner- generally in the drawing-room. There are hot muf- fins and a bit of cake; but to pour tea is the business and to drink it the pastime. Iinhale the smoke of a prime Havana with delight, and the odor of a pure tea comes to me like incense; yet I neither smoke nor drink. Tea puts my nerves     362     Romanzce of the Table. in motions like the telegraph wires in a gale, and I toss on a sleepless pillow, while my brain whirls and spins with ceaseless and not pleasurable anxiety. I think I should make a capital subject on whom to try the effects of new medicines, so quick does my system respond to every innovation; but I should require a larger remuneration to induce me to drink tea in large quantities than to take mineral poisons in small. This fact proves either that the systems of the race are differently constituted, or that we can, by habit and practice, become accustomed to almost anything. I hope tea is harmless, for people enjoy it so much, and I like to see them happy. But, although Americans and English make a feat- ure of the tea-table proper, they by no means equal other nations in the amount consumed, or in their devotion to the article itself. Russia, next to China, stands at the head of tea- drinking nations; and Russia has her pick of the crop before any other nation is allowed to come in. Russians take a natural pride in the fact that their tea is brought across the Ural mountains and the steppes of Tartary, and that it does not lose its flavor in transportation, as does that which foreigners carry across the salt water. And the tea of Russia is delic- ious. Its aroma comes to meet you in a fragrant cloud, as you enter the room where it is. The Rus- sian Bear is hardly a symbol of the people of those luxurious climes, who drive the fastest horses in the world, who clothe themselves in the furs of princes, and who monopolize all the champagne of the Widow Cliquot. Of course, they drink the best tea in the world, and they drink their fill. Russia would have   A Chat Over a Cup of Tea.    363 been the Paradise of Dr. Johnson, whose allowance was twelve cups, although in that country they do not serve you out tea by the cup, but bring you a tea-pot nf generous capacity. In supping his tea, the Russian gormand will sometimes put lumps of sugar in his mouth, and filter his tea through that saccharine medium. Tchai, as the Russians call it, is the staple drink to offer a stranger. In the restaurants and refreshment rooms, of course, it is to be had quicker than anything else, while in private houses it is a mark of politeness to offer the caller a cup of the beverage that "cheers, but not inebriates." In an eating house, or exchange, called the tratker, an organ is the instrument which makes melody for the Russian while he is partaking of his beloved drink, and with the ability to call for tea-stock ait tchai-the visitor may rest himself, and enjoy the organ as much as he pleases. The tea is drank from glass, and it requires some dexterity to handle a tumbler full of hot liquid, without being burned. The Russian does not like cold tea. He puts hot water into his glass, lets it stand a moment, then pours it out, and fills with tea. He weakens it, if too strong, and adds a slice of lemon. The pot of tea is to him an inspiration, and he knows well how to make it go as far as possible; and then, when it will possibly go no further, his next great luxury is taken up-the earthen pipe, with its long cherry stem. I am almost inclined to think that there is some occult mystery hidden from us; some spiritual phe- nomenon which determines the natural likes and dis- likes of mankind. Why should the Russians be tea- drinkers above all others? They do not cultivate it;     364    Romance of the Table. in fact, they could not. It is brought by fatiguing journeys, and at great expense. Russia, too, is a cold and rather forlorn country, and one would sup- pose they would run into the use of spirits and drinks possessing much carbon-chocolate, for in- stance; but, while they do partake of all the luxuries of other nations, their passion is for tea. Now, if we go to the land of Hafiz and Abdallah, we find that in Arabia they drink coffee, and in Persia, tea. In Spain they thirst for sugared water; in France, for heavy chocolate. The, Frenchman sits for an hour lazily sipping his chocolate with a spoon, at a season of the year when it would seem the most improper beverage he could call for. One thing we can certainly vouch for-the love of tea-drinkers for each other, when they are at the tea- table. It is asserted that scandal is the predominant intellectual entertainment on such occasions, and that, if the tea imbibers love themselves, they do not love anybody else. I am not prepared to accept this as a truth; but, were it so, it would open a wide field for philosophical inquiry. The study of the relation- ship between what we drink and the development of our mental and moral nature would be worthy of a Dr. Porson. Perhaps, as with other drinks, quantity has rome- thing to do with its action. People under the moder- ate influence of wine are full of fraternal kindness, and as happy as larks; beyond a certain quantity they grow quarrelsome, revengeful, and ready for any crime. I have seen people very happy at the tea- table, full of sparkling wit and ready repartee; but Mrs. Caudle, I believe, went very deep in her pota-   A Chat Over a Cup of Tea.    365 tions, and drank her tea very strong. I will not further recall that harrowing story. Let me bring up Dr. Johnson once more, and give an anecdote of his method of tea-drinking: Sir Joshua Reynolds reminded him that he had drank eleven cups. He replied: "Sir, I did not count your glasses of wine-why should you num- ber my cups of tea? I should have released this lady from any further trouble, if it had not been for your remark; but you have reminded me that I want one of my dozen, and I must request Mrs. C. to round up my number. Madam, I must tell you, you have es- caped much better than a certain lady did a while ago, upon whose patience I have intruded more than I have on yours; but the lady asked me for no other purpose than to make a zany of me, and set me gab- bling to a set of people I knew nothing of. So, madam, I had my revenge, for I swallowed five and twenty cups of tea, and did not treat her to so many words." Can any one decide what the effect of tea is from such an illustration? But there is one thing quite certain: that there is hardly a more beautiful object to be seen than a tea- table well set out, with the surroundings of proper furniture, pictures and curtains. The damask cloth, the silver service, the fragile, ethereal china, ready for the celestial nectar; the biscuit, preserves, and all the varied adjuncts of a well arranged household, fill the heart with a glow of enthusiasm. We know that this meal, at least, comes under the particular care of the lady of the mansion and her daughter, if she is so blessed; that fairy white fingers have beaten the eggs     366    Romance of the Tablc. and the sugar, and brought into harmonious combina- tion the cake and the jelly; that it was an eye for beauty and order which brought the bread to the table so nicely cut, and that only a soul which could soar above the prose of life could have put the peaches and the plums into a shape worthy of a Longfellow's poetic muse. The tea-table, thus ar- ranged, is a poem: and, could Hdared Htake but one little cup, I can almost- fancy I should immortal- ize myself, and take my proper position among the literary deities of Mount Parnassus. 4 Oh! Mr. Williams," exclaimed Florence, as that gentleman laid down the paper. "It is lucky for you that you are a married man. With such ideas you would find little favor with the ladies, I fear." "I dare say you are right," rejoined that gentleman. "Temperance societies are easily formed, because the ladies have a horror of intemperance, but an anti-tea society would have up-hill work to perform." "But tea does not affect every one unpleasantly," said Dr. Lorton. "I have drank tea for forty years, and do not see but what I am as well off with it, as without it." "Possibly," said Mr. Williams, " but that only proves the old adage, that what is one man's meat, is another man's poison. It is possibly true that those who are rendered nervous by tea-drinking are the ex- ceptions, and not the rule. What do you think, Dr. Sollinger?" "I think," replied the Doctor, " that many, yes, most people, become habituated to both food and drink, and escape the evil consequences; they do not know   A Chat Over a Cup of Tea.    367 that the poison works so slow as to escape positive detection. I can hardly believe that strict temper- ance in all things will not give us a longer average of life than we have at present. People use tobacco without apparent injury; yet, once in a while, a man is cut off with cancer, or some other horrible disease, which may be directly traceable to that noxious plant." "There is a soothing effect about tea," said Thomas, "which lulls the mind into a false security. When the brain is fevered and anxious, people run to some opiate, and tea may be better than either alcohol, tobacco, or opium." "XVe will agree, then, to consider it the least of many evils," said Mr. Williams. "We can never eradicate a habit so firmly fixed; all we can do is in some measure to control it." "And tell what is a good and innocent substitute, if one can be found," continued Florence. This second re-union passed as did the first-with much pleasant conversation, but with no particular subject which would interest the reader. It seemed almost impossible, in that pleasant aboie, and with so many beautiful surroundings, to settle down to the consideration of any recondite question in philosophy,     C H A?T E R X. DR. SOLLINGER GIVES A HSTORY OF SOME OF HS PATIENTS. Sickness comes, it matters not How prudent we may be, Nor though we pray for life and health Upon our bended knee. But when the Good Physician comes, To give us hope and cheer, We rise above the pains of earth To regions bright and clear.-A yimer. "Tom, dear!" said Florence to her husband, "] have been thinking of Mabel Myrick very much, re- cently." "Yes!" "I called on her yesterday. She does not seem at all conscious of her condition, or danger, yet she falls at times into that dreamy state, as though her thoughts were being gradually withdrawn from earth to heaven. She has an accordeon, and she plays on it very nicely. I took it up, and commenced playing "Home, Sweet Home," slowly and softly, when Mabel broke out into the words, in a tone which brought the tears to my eyes, so soft and plaintive were they. She seemed to sing less with her lips than with her soul." "Do you know, dear, what has been done for her?" ...1 "No, only that the family doctor has been con- stantly in attendance, and has done all in his power for her."   Dr. Sollinger and his Patients.  369 "He came at last to the conclusion, I believe, that she had better go abroad!" "Yes, and I presume her parents will take her this Fall. She is an only child, and their anxiety is very great. I have been thinking whether Dr. Sollinger could do anything for her." ' I tell you what, Florence, I think it would do her good to come here to-night. The Doctor can be drawn out to say something about his own sutccess, and that may open a mine of encouragement and hope, even if she is not placed under his care. She may, too, profit from his advice." "I was thinking so myself," replied Florence, "and, if you will go with me, we will stop there, on your way from the cars, and ask them. The weather is fine and dry, and she will run no risk." "Agreed, dear, and we will see that she has a pleas- ant evening, and goes home early." "Mabel is by no means a confirmed consumptive, or in the last stages," said Florence, "and but for the clearness of her skin, and her coulgh, no one would suspect her of being an invalid. If consumption in its incipient stages can be cured, I do not see why she could not be." Mabel, with her father and mother, accepted the invitation thankfully, and the evening opened. as usual, with 'that genial interchange of tholugllt in which the faculties of man are put to their higlhest use-that of making others happy. All the wisdom of angels and men can accomplish nothing more- except in degree. Florence played and stng some of those English ballads which: she knew Mabel delighted in, and she 24     370    Romance of the Table. drew out from Magnum one of his short, genial stories. Then Mayhew and Dr. Lorton gradually drew from Dr. Sollinger a few of his ideas with regard to the influence of the mind over the body, and the cure of disease through spiritual influences. "I should like to hear of some of those you have realy treated," said Mabel. "Do you make them all bind their heads, and be very good?" The Doctor laughed. "Indeed I do," replied he- "at least, I try. There is a great deal said in the Bible about stiff-necked and rebellious people, and we are to infer from that that stiff necks and rebellion are evils against which we must contend." "Yes," said Mabel, "I understand that, but I thought those passages referred to the heart of man and not to his neck, except spiritually." "True," replied the Doctor, "yet even Nature teaches us to place the body in outer harmony with the spirit. We bend the knee in prayer, the head in worship. Some touch the forehead to the ground- the Greek Church Christians always do. All our spiritual thoughts and feelings are apt to manifest themselves outwardly. "But in disease, we begin instantly to rebel. We can't endure pain; confinement is irksome; we fret over our worldly business and engagements. We are exactly in the position of Isaiah's stiff-necked and re- bellious people. What can a physician do with a patient under such circumstances? If the spirit bends, the body is sure to do so, but we must some- times reach the spirit through the body. If we can get the sinner to kneel, it is a gain. If the Meth-   Dr. Sollinger and his Patients.   371 odists, at their camp-meetings and revivals, can but get people on the anxious seat, they begin to rejoice; the spirit may follow the body. Now I make no earnest appeals, I merely advise. Drop your head, I say, for a half hour; it will rest you. Well, the patient drops her head, and she is sure to drop into pleasant, peaceful thoughts, at the same time. She feels better. She tries it again, and feels still better. A habit is thus formed; the spirit becomes pliable, and the body yields to treatment. There is the whole secret." "You have treated some very desperate cases, have you npt, Doctor?" inquired Mr. Williams. "It is not proper for a man to boast of his own doings," said the Doctor, "and, in reality, I take little credit to myself. I but turn my patients,who have been wandering from Nature, back to the true path. The doctors give a dose of medicine, I give a dose of Nature-that is all the difference between us. "A few years ago I had a severe case of paralysis- a young lady, who, for three years, had been utterly unable to move. As may be supposed, the doctors within reach had been exhausted, and Galen and Hippocrates had been called upon until their high priests were hoarse. In three months I sent her home well, and she has remained so--- "What did you do for her, Doctor? please tell us," exclaimed Florence. "I rubbed life into her," replied the Doctor. "I taught her how to revive the drooping energies of her spiritual life, and to have faith in herself. "Sometimes the treatment is mainly mechanical I       P     372    Romance of the Table. A short time ago, a lady came to me whose arm had been broken at the wrist. It had been set, but she was never able to use it. It gave her constant pain, and some surgeons declared it would be necessary to rebreak and reset it. "I used the fast and pack with due regard to diet, but I devoted my main attention to a restoration of life in the arm itself, by beating, rubbing and bathing it. In a short time, the broken arm was as sound as the other, and remains so. "A case came to me from New Jersey-a lady with an affection of the spine. She had not walked for eighteen years, was confined to her bed most of the time, and was, indeed, a very great sufferer. It is hardly to be expected that a severe chronic complaint of this kind can be thoroughly eradicated, but the lady is now able to take charge of her house, and to walk long distances, with very little trouble. "Another case of paralysis of the lower limbs found me out. A lady from Long Island had used crutches for three years. She spent one summer with me, and she writes from home that she dances as well as ever, and enjoys the exercise all the more for her long and forced deprivation. "In fact," continued the Doctor, " if I enjoy any of my victories at all, it is my victory over the preju- dices of the Long Island Friends, or Quakers. The lady whose broken arm I restored was one, and there were one or two others-near neighbors. The rest hesitated, and were doubters. They gradually thawed out, however, and I have few warmer friends now than those self-same Quakers.   Dr. Sollinger and his Patients.  373 "There is scarcely a disease I have not treated; everything to which the human frame is subject. I have only mentioned a few of those which seemed to defy ordinary treatment.. All the common diseases, called acute, such as fevers, are mere child's play, and yield very readily to the simplest treatment." "And you never give medicine of any kind?" inquired Mabel's father. "No, and I do not believe other physicians would, if they thought a little more, and could devote more time to their patients. There is a cant phrase in familiar use, but very suggestive-' Our doctor gives very little medicine'-and bread pills, I doubt not, are more common than we suppose; but I will not weary' you further; besides, I am hungry with talking-pass me an apple, Mayhew." "The fact is," said the bachelor, "that Florence is the poet of the woods and fields. I tried my hand at it and failed, although I bought a cow, and planted any quantity of honeysuckles." "You should not have married," said Ada. "That possibly took all the poetry out of you." "No, the gift of poetry is divine. None can write, without they are descended from the Muses; but go ahead, Florence, let us see what the gods of Olympus have done for you." "Very little, I fear," replied Florence, "and you must not make fun of me in advance." "If we don't in advance, we cannot at all," replied the bachelor "I know that, Florence dear, from past experien e."     374      Romance of the 7able. Then Florence took her manuscript from her pocket, and in that low, sweet, musical voice, with which woman reaches the heart, she read the follow- ing poem: The Sleeping Rose. Art thou asleep, my rose? Thy crimson leaves why close, As on thee soft the dews of night come down? O! lift thy bending head, Thy petals bright outspread; The god of night my favorite would crown I Hold not so close the gems, The dewy diadems, That gentle eve hath placed upon thy heart. Open the folded gate, The quivering moonbeams wait To wreathe the pearls about thee, and depart. Art weary, then, my flower? And yet, since morning hour, Idler I methinks but little thou hast done. True, thou dids't softly turn, Though how I could not learn, To meet the ardent kisses of the sun. Thou sleepest yet, perchance; I, with my earthly glance; And senses dull, thy work could ne'er descry; Too fine for my poor thought, Thou this repose hast bought By duties well performed, though silently. Dost dream? Tell it, I pray, Here, by the moon's pale ray, Around me cast, red rose, a loving spell; And with thy fragrant breath, Ere thou dost sleep in death, The mystery of thy flower-life tell   Dr. Sollinger and his Pat ienis,      7 For thou art mine alone, And 'neath my care hast blown- Many a fresh draught have I brought to thee. Then weave thy rare perfume Into sweet words, whose bloom Within my heart shall thy memorial be. Am I, alas! too dull To grasp the beautiful In measure great, and free from all dlloy? Not ever thus my soul Shall bonds of clay control, Or keep me from the fullness of my joy 1 Mine is a richer dower Than thine, O beauteous flower! God's love to me eternal life hath given. Freed from earth's woes and tears, Through all the countless years, My soul through grace shall drink the bliss ol SAi.,. There was a hush upon the little assembil as the fair reader's voice died away; a hush as tho gh the listeners were waiting  to hear an echo from   the angels who  sing around  the Throne. Then Ada threw her arms around her sister, and exclained: "O you dear, good sister, who can write so sweetly as you do?" And then, the spell being broken, there was a gen- eral outhreak of pleasant words, which some people might call flattery, but which, in reality, were only honest expressions of feeling. Florence, to avoid any additional compliments, ran to the piano, and soon the entire company were singing that medley which all private assemblies always sing when they drop into music without any definite aim or end.     CH A?T E R XI. CONSUMPTION AND ITB TREATMENT, Slowly the lamp of life Burns up its oil; slowly, yet surely; And then the crusted wick Holds to the dying flame until a breath, So light not e'en the frailest leaf is moved, And it is gone.-Dr. Proudfoot. It was very natural indeed for Dr. Lorton and Dr. Sollinger to have a skirmish over the theories which had been so plainly propounded, and so vigorously maintained. The first represented the old school, the other the new; one had become imbued with the theories of the ancient schools of philosophy, starting from Esculapius, and modernized in the colleges of the present time; while the last threw overboard everything and everybody but old Dame Nature, and drew his inspiration only from within the laboratory of his own understanding. To fully elaborate the technical pathology of consumption, as set forth by Dr. Lorton, would be impossible; yet to give a glance thereat is essential to a clear understanding of the great difference between the two systems. Of course, Dr. Sollinger could not deny the clear insight of Dr. Lorton, nor his ability to make a diagnosis of disease. In fact, he was curious to see how far the Doctor coincided with what he knew himself, or had read in books; and, at his request, Dr. Lorton made the following statemennts:   Conzsumtzion and its Treatment.  3" "A predisposition to consumption is inherited from parents, and this is, of all causes, the most prevalent and powerful. This is one of the most mysterious of the operations of Nature, and one of the most difficult to counteract. It is by no means certain that every person born of consumptive parents will die of con- sumption; and sometimes one generation in a family may be passed over without its appearance; but still, the virus is in the blood, and it is sure to break out again at subsequent periods. It is, also, no doubt true that a deficiency in the vitality of the parents, and other diseases which have a tendency to render the offspring feeble, will also lay them open to the insidious attacks of pulmonary consumption. So will it spring from local causes, from impure air, sedentary occupations, overtaxed brain and nerves, and imperfect nutrition. 'The duration of consumption is about two years, though many cases last a great number of years, and others may terminate in a month; what is, in common parlance, called ."galloping consumption" being by no means infrequent. "The approach of the disease is insidious and gradual. There is a slight, dry cough, especially in the morning. Little notice is taken of it, or it is referred to the throat. Fatigue is more easily induced than ordinarily. The patient becomes paler and thinner, and is out of breath on, going up stairs, or ascending a height. With or without these symptoms, hemorrhage may occur, varying from a mere streak to a pint. The cough, at first dry, becomes troublesome, and there is much expectora- tion. These symptoms are accompanied, by dryness     378     Romance of the Tabte. of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet; and with night sweats, among the most disagreeable and troublesome of all physical disturbances. There is a little pain, generally, in the chest; chills, followed by hectic fever, are then observed, with disturbance of the bowels; the features become pinched, the body emaciated, the eyes glassy, the breathing frequent ana hurried; and thus the physical form visibly decays, until death closes the scene, and then there is but little of the tabernacle of the soul left to which to pay the last, sad rites of sepulture. "As to the treatment," continued Dr. Lorton, "physicians differ. There is absolutely no medical science which will reach the disease when once seated in the system; and any treatment, to be suc- cessful, should be resorted to at the very beginning. Patients have recovered from advanced stages of the disease, and persons have been known to recover with but one lung left; but these are exceptions to the rule, and cannot, by any means, prove it. In these cases, Nature has,. in some mysterious way, arrested the complaint, the tubercles have dried up, the cavities healed; but the victims never enjoyed robust health thereafter. "When there are hereditary tendencies, great care should be taken to prevent any development of the disease, or to check it immediately on its appearance. I agree with many men, scientific and unscientific, that the result is to be effected, if at all, principally by hygienic conditions, rather than by medicines, they being used only as accessories. Man, like a plant, can only thrive under favorable auspices. Climate, food, drink, clothing, and repose of mind   Consumption and its Treatment,   379 and body, are to minister to our needs. Proper nutrition and proper assimilation must be looked after; and, following this, is the elimination from the 4 system of worn out and effete materials. "Those who can change their climate should make choice of that which is mild, without being debilitat- ing, with few changes. Such a climate brings into activity the liver and the skin, producing thus a powerful diversion from, and relief to, the lungs. The patient should live as much as possible out of doors, and take plenty of exercise, thus promoting rapid and healthy digestion. Should I be asked to point out a location like this in the United States, I should refer to a belt of country stretching from Aiken, S. C., to Huntsville, Ala., the latter place being sheltered from the cold winds of the Atlantic, and from those of the north and northwest. The patient's room should be large and well ventilated, that the blood may be thoroughly decarbonised. The food should be nutritious, but not concentrated, bulk being essential to the proper functions of digestion. More nutritious food is taken up by the lacteals, leaving behind too little for the bowels to contract upon; and I fully agree with your idea, Dr. Sollinger-so far as I understand it-that it is a wrong policy to feed a consumptive patient on beefsteaks, and beer, as mafiy do. Besides, the presence of bulk is necessary as a stimulus to the liver, inducing a free flow of bile, which is the natural stimulous of the bowels. I think myself that the use of too concentrated food and bad cooking are more productive of ill health than all other causes combined. How  often do we see patients, with consumption deeply seated sit down to -      380     Romance of the Table. a dinner of meats, gravies, with' a few vegetables, and those of a doubtful character; a little bread and a great deal of pastry; a dinner taxing the powers of a blacksmith-how much more of a delicate man or woman! Overloading the stomach is a sure cause of indigestion and debility. "Water is the best drink for sick or well; but tea and coffee may be used in moderation, by those with whom they agree. If fermented or distilled liquors are taken at all-and I do not recommend them- they should be taken only with the meals, as they act there much more kindly. Taken with the food, they are incorporated and digested with it, entering the system slowly and gradually; but' taken in an empty stomach, they enter directly into the circulation and act as an excitant or irritant. The clothing should be warm, with flannel next the skin, and frequent changes, especially of the stockings, which should be of wool, are desirable. "And then, first and foremost, occupy the mind. Something to do acts as a tonic, leading to activity of mind and body. The attention of the patient is directed to other things than himself, and the func- tions of nature are more regular and harmonious. Do not allow the spirits to be depressed, and keep the mind cheerful. Goethe says' we should be ever doing that which is next to us;' and its application to the every-day affairs of common life is useful to the well, and beneficial to the invalid. "What medicines are used should be selected from the class of tonics. Iron, and the vegetable bitters, are often found useful. Hydrocyanic acid, in doses of two to four drops, will often allay the cough. I   Conszumtion and its Trcatmict.   381 am a friend, too, to cod-liver oil, as I believe tne evidences in its favor leave no doubt of its utility. It seems to act as a nutriment, rather than as a medicine, and under its administration, the patient frequently improves in health and strength. Where the oil disagrees, cream may be substituted. It is a remark- able iact that in Iceland, where the food of the inhab- itants consists mainly of fish, and where fish oils are largely consumed, phthisis and scrofula are un- known; and they are rare in woolen factories, where oils are largely employed." "And what do you doctors give to check night sweats?" asked Mr. Williams, as Dr. Lorton stopped speaking. "They are best controlled by astringents and mineral acids. Of these, the oxide of zinc, taken at bed time, in doses of five or six grains, is often suc- cessful in checking them." "Are not other diseases often mistaken' for con- sumption?" asked Mayhew. "Not so much now  as formerly. All diseases which were attended by a wasting of the body were grouped under consumption. Bronchitis is one of them. Now, however, the term has become restricted to the development of a tuberculous matter in the lungs. It has been maintained by some that tuber- cles are not the only cause of this disease, but that any circumscribed and maintained inflammation will produce it; and this is caused sometimes by the effu- sion, retention, and coagulation of blood in the small branches of the air tubes." "One of the strangest features of consumption," said Vohlen,4 is the general, calm placidity with which     382     Romance of the Table. patients endure their sufferings and meet their fate." "Yes," said Mayhew; "I remember, when I was South, I met a gentleman, young, wealthy, and good- looking, but so far gone in consumption that he could walk a square only with the greatest difficulty. Yet he ate heartily, dressed neatly, and, when at rest, could laugh and joke with the greatest ease and apparent enjoyment. He returned to his home at the North, and died in a few weeks after reaching it." "And I have had many cases of young women," said Dr. Lorton, "who had everything to make life attractive, health only excepted. Yet they have borne their fate with a cheerful resignation which it was beautiful to witness. I remember one who puts me in mind of the words of Byron: "' Soft as the memory of buried love, Pure as the prayers which childhood wafts above, Was she.' "'She did not seem to die, but to softly fade from our sight, translated to another sphere." "What does Faust say about a spirit world encir- cling us?" asked Florence. Mayhew replied: "'A spirit world encircles thee; The genii are not fled; Thine is the eye that will not see, And thine the heart that's dead. " "I like better the idea," said Mr. Williams, "that there are no dead hearts, and no eyes which do not see; and that, as soon as one ceases to beat, and the other to recognise the things of earth, they go on beating and seeing in another sphere." "And I am inclined to believe," said Dr. Sollinger, "that the reason why patients are so cheerful arises from a spiritual attendance and support. Children ?   Consumption and its Treatment.   383 depait this life with composure and little pain; and there is a power, no doubt, which lifts us all above this sphere, and tenderly carries us to our home beyond the skies." "And now, Dr. Sollinger," said Mayhew, " we wait your exposition of the treatment of consumption with an awakened curiosity." "I think it will do for another evening, and another talk," said the Doctor.     CHAPTER XII. DR. SOLLINGER GIVES HS IDEAS ON CONSUMPTIOW. While earnest thou gazest Comes boding of terror, Come phantom and error, Perplexing the bravest With doubt and misgiving But heard are the voices, Heard are the Sages, The Works and the Ages. "Choose Well. Your choice is Brief, and yet endless."-Goethe. "I am not disposed," said Dr. Sollinger, when they met again, to quarrel with the pathology of consump- tion, as defined by Dr. Lorton and by the physicians of the old school generally. It would be useless fol me to set up my learning against theirs, for there is no disease which has been more thoroughly analyzed. The hospital and the dissecting room, as well as the thousands of patients in private circles, have afforded abundant opportunities for investigation, and they have all been improved. If I differ from them at all it is in respect to their general principles of treat- ment, and their too great reliance upon medicine, when they know its almost utter inefficiency. It strikes me that they have not given scope enough to the general demands of the body in consumption, and have treated it exclusively as a local complaint. Thus we find the system of inhalation adopted by many; a system which endeavors by soothing medi- cines, given in the form of gas or vapor, to reach the   Dr. Soiznger's Ideas of Consunption. 385 exa t seat of the complaint, and act directly upon the diseased tissues. ( Blt let me, before speaking of any treatment, first refer to what I consider popular fallacies in regard to brea hing. There is such a thing as breathing too much. The air expelled by the lungs is very differ- ent from the air inhaled. It contains eight per cent. more carbonic acid gas, derived from the venous blood. This air, of course, is poisonous, and those who stay long. in confined rooms feel the effect in headache and dizziness. The great cry for ventilation arises from the necessity for expelling this surplus carbonic acid. "Now, did it never occur to you, Doctor Lorton, that people frequently retain this poisonous matter in the lungs? Inflate the lungs by a deep inspiration several times in succession, or take violent exercise which will lead to quick breathing, anct he same sense of dizziness and oppression follows. The lungs do not contract sufficiently to expel all the air breathed, and what remains becomes overcharged with carbonic acid gas. This, in turn, affects the nourishing power of the blood, and that affects the body. The whole system  becomes diseased. The carbonic acid causes the rapid breathing and sense of suffocation in consumptive patients. In these cases of injudicious breathing which I have referred to the upper portion of the lungs is more used than the other, and there is a portion, and that portion, too, which is the most essential to health, which becomes inert for want of use. Let me illustrate: "By improper breathing the upper part of the chest may so expand that the individual flatters himself he 25 b            .l-            \     386     Romance of the Table. has become a Hercules. He gives a specimen of his ability to inflate his lungs by throwing his chest out, and drawing his stomach in. His shoulder blades almost meet; his head is erect, and he imagines, as it is often said, that he has the lungs of a blacksmith. But a blacksmith don't inflate his lungs in that way, nor any man who leads a sensible life and breathes in a natural way. It is not the upper third of the lungs which needs inflation, but the lower. A man should breathe downward, and thus give vitality and activity to the organs of digestion and absorption, for on these organs, quite as much as on the lungs, the health and life of man depends. The popular idea, that the more frequently you breathe the better, is a fallacy. My own impression is that consumption is often induced by carbonic acid gas retained in the lungs. Immerse a man in it, as in a deep well where it has collected, and he dies almost instantly; and it has the same effect, in a certain degree, when retained in the system. "The laws of God and of Nature are the laws of harmony. It is not right to give one organ the work of another. We must bring the entire system into orderly relations, if we wish perfect health. Of what use will it be to expand the chest, and inflate and enlarge the lungs, if we neglect the digestion? The more blood, and the greater the quantity of air we take into the lungs, the more carbonic acid is generated, and the greater danger the patient is in who has any tendency towards consumption. "It is quite as essential, then, to expel the'air from the lungs as to take it in, and in many cases of disease, as in croup and diphtheria, great assistance   Dr. Sollinger' s Ideas of Consummption. 387 may be rendered by pressure on the chest with the hand thus helping the patient to expel the air which is often taken into the lungs spasmodically. This may be continued until it affords relief, and this may often be done in consumption. In fact, in whatever way the sluggish operations of Nature can be aided by external assistance, aid her. The Swedish move- ment case is one means of doing this, and is often of great benefit. A paralyzed arm may be restored by systematic and patient rubbing. The organs of digestion can be marvelously assisted by manipula- tion ;and, as I have stated before, the efficacy of the human hand is almost beyond calculation." "Your ideas are all excellent," said Dr. Lorton, as Dr. Sollinger paused. "The misfortune is that patients are too busy, or too ignorant of the laws of life, to attend to themselves, or to ask advice until it is too late. Then they rush to the physician, and expect him to perform miracles." "But how is it," asked Mayhew, "that so many consumptive patients live for many years? There was the poet Willis, for instance, who was affected with lung disease for I do not know how maiy years, twenty perhaps, and I think he was near sixty when he died." "And I remember," said  Mr. Williams, "his humorous accounts of his own physical troubles, and of the various sovereign remedies he essayed, one of which, I believe, was a soap-jacket." "Willis," said Dr. Lorton, "was a man of extraor- dinary tenacity of life, assisted by great animal spir- its. He lived, too, in a part of the country free from miasma; was fond of horses and of riding, and I dare     388     Romance of the Table. say took good general care of his system. I know a man, who is yet living, considerately past eighty. In early life, but after attaining manhood, he had every symptom of consumption, and was sent out West, where he took to the occupation of a wood-cutter, chopping trees all day long. He became as hardy as the pine knots he lived among, and afterward fol- lowed several professions, being at one time a preacher of some note." "There is no positive cure- for this disease," resumed Dr. Sollinger, "after it is once deeply seated. If the patient recovers at all it is more to be attribu- ted to a variety of concurring circumstances than the skill of the physician. The effort of both doctor and patient should be to prolong life, hoping that Nature may work one of her miracles; but that is all that we can do. My efforts are devoted to give tone to the entire system; to restore the vitality of those organs which sympathize with the lungs; to restore the functions of the skin; to regulate the appetite, and promote digestion; to bring the mind .into harmony with the works and will of the Creatur; and thus give the lungs absolutely nothing to do but get well, or; at least, to fight against their destroyer. If science can go further than this I will follow science, but such is not my experience." There was an animated conversation after the Doc- tor had closed his little exposition, mainly relating, however, to the experiences of each member of the party. The question then mainly turned on the benefits of travel, and on this there was more unanim- ity than might be expected. "If a patient could have all the attendance and   Dr So line's Ideas of Consumlntion. 389 comfokts of home," said Dr. Lorton, "there would be, no doubt, great benefits derived; and what I have said in regard to Aiken, will apply to many parts of the world. But the trouble is that patients do not have those comforts, and often find themselves in places wnere utter dullness drives them into melancholy and despair. I agree with Dr. Sollinger, that it is essential to have the mind at rest. Where the whole body is weak and nervous the poor sufferer clings to all who can afford him consolation or amusement. Life is sweet, and his surroundings often give him a better! hold upon it than anything else could. The air may be everything he desires for his lungs, but; if that is all he has, it may produce no good effect. Whatl can be more terrible than a hotel full of consumptive patients-some full of hope, some des- pairing, and some dropping off into the land of silence?" "A melancholy picture, truly," said Florence. "I had rather stay at home; a great deal rather," said Ada. "Where Wealth is unlimited, and friends devoted," remarked Mr. Williams, "I doubt not a change may be very beneficial. There is much to charm in a foreign country, and even the region of the Nile, one of the best countries in the world for lung diseases, has much to attract and to divert the attention of the patient from himself. With all the other surround- ings, and the appliances needed for comfort, I should think the disease might ;be arrested, if not perma- nently cured." "It is possible," said Dr. Sollinger; " but how many are there, of all who are afflicted, who are able thus to     390     Romance of the Table. float lazily-on the bosom of the Nile, and draw inspi- ration and health from their dreams of past centuries, l and their own happier prospects in the future?" "True indeed," said Florence; and she sighed as she thought of the poor who have no refuge but in the mercies of Heaven, MfiA i w ' s a , *y \y,5 t, . -.    CHAPTER     XIII. FLORENCE AND IIER HUSBAND TALK ABOUT A SUBJECT WHCH NATURALLY FOLLOWS THE LAST CHAPTER. There was, 'tis said, and I believe, a time When humble Christians died with views sublime; When all were ready for their faith to bleed, But few to write or wrangle for their creed; When lively faith upheld the sinking heart, And friends, assured to meet, prepared to part; When love felt hope, when sorrow grew serene, And all was comfort in the death-bed scene.-Crabbe. Mal'el was not present at the discussions on con- sumption, but her father had been an attentive lis- tener. He drank in with avidity all that was said, and he came to see and consult the two doctors privately. He was much encouraged, too, by these interviews; his ideas of life and of his own responsi- bilities were much enlarged, and he was led to com- prehend the fact that each individual has in himself a power to aid the sick of,'which he is not aware, until he begins to practice. "You can do more than we can," said Dr. Lorton to him; "for you are always present, and can con- stantly exert that influence which strength has over weakntess. You can watch and direct. There is a weight resting upon every invalid. We must assist to carry it, or remove it entirely, if possible.

I am not quite prepared for that, but think the two systems may be advantageously joined. Still, I am a servant of Nature, and she points to the sublime duty of supporting each other." "Then you would advise me to go abroad?" "Yes," said Dr. Lorton, "certainly, for you are rich enough to afford it, and the idea of travel is delightful to your daughter. You can do the plan- ning, and quietly draw her to those places where the scenery and people will divert her mind, and the atmosphere will be good for her lungs. See that she has rest without weariness; exercise without pain. Do not rush from one place to another, but travel in that negligent way which will induce repose. See to her diet and regularity of habits, avoiding all dissipa- tion, and you will probably bring her home well." Mr. Myrick thanked the doctor for his advice, and  Dr. Sollinger also, from whose lips he took down, and carefully wrote out, a great deal of useful infor- mation. "We shall go with much lighter hearts for this help," said he, "and I trust we shall be able to return it a hundred fold." It was a peaceful summer night, shortly after the last meeting, and that meeting in reality was the last, that Thomas and Florence sat on the piazza of their cottage, watching the glorious moon, which was nearly at the full. They were alone, for a wonder, and even the little pattering feet and silver voices had ceased their music for the day. There was a hush upon Nature, and husband and wife were wandering in the realms of contemplation.   Talk between Florence and Thomas. 393 Florence was the first to break silence. "We have had very long and interesting talks about life and its preservation, but what is life, Thonas?" "Life, in a word, is the opposite of death." "Yes, I know that, but that is hardly satisfactory. Death is but a relative term; an appearance, or, at the best, it belongs to matter. Is there death as applied to man?" "No, or immortality would have no meaning. If the soul has immortality as a principle it can change its state, but it can never cease to ejist." "Tilen we can only know of life through the fact that ve live!" "Reduced to plain, common English, that is about all," replied Thomas. "But the quality of life has something to do with the question. The light of a star and that of a candle have a principle in common, but how great the gulf that lies between them." "Yet, however high the state of the individual," said Florence, " he only knows that he lives; but of what life is, in its essence, he is as ignorant as the lowest of humanity." "In one sense, yes, in another, no," replied her husband. "Do you remember the theory, in the Ara- bian Nights, of the rope-maker's wife, who found a large 'diamond in the stomach of a fish?" "Y Yes." "XWell, the children were immensely pleased with it, on account of its brilliancy, but they did not have the slightest appreciation of it as a diamond. A man with an exquisite taste for gems would come infi- nitely closer to an understanding of its quality than     394    Romance of the Table. the ignorant family possibly could. So with life; the higher the quality of life possessed by us the more interior will be our perceptions." "That is true, undoubtedly. An artist sees more in a landscape than a plodding farmer forming a part of it, and who only thinks of it with reference to what it yields." "And we must remember," continued Thomas, "that the higher we ascend in our states of life, the nearer we come to the Author. It would be pleasant to see a beautiful picture exactly with the same eyes as the painter, and I think the angels may possibly have the power to see into themselves, and under- stand something of their own natures which is hidden from us." "It is pleasant to see with the eyes of those we love," replied Florence. "And life, in its highest, purest form, is love, essen- tially," said Thomas. "In fact, we know of no other word which will express it. I said that life is the opposite of death. Well, love is the opposite of sel- fishness and hatred. Every quality which is opposed to love is death, and, if we can suppose it possible for men to exist in a condition in which love has no part, we can only conceive of a condition of perpetual death." "But love," said Florence, " as a term, is not very much understood. There is a great deal which goes by the name which will hardly pass muster in another world." "Certainly, as there are a great many articles which look like gold, with very little of the metal exter- nally. Surface love is quite as common as surface   A Talk between Florence and Thomas. 395 gilt. The love that is the true life of man ha3 very little alloy, and when it forms the entire being it enfdlds everything in its embrace; heaven, earth, and every human- creature. With us, love is a form of expression, or the definition of a sentiment; but in- Heaven it is the very man himself." "Man, then, acts love, you think, rather than feels it. What he does is the natural impulse of his heart, and nothing comes in collision with it?" "Exactly. Here people are governed by diverse sentiments, and man is drawn first one way, then nother. The world leads him; prudence leads him; money leads him.- Like a ship at sea, running under steam, but with sails set against the wind, he makes but little progress. He is far more apt to ask what his neighbor thinks than to consult his own heart and conscience. In such a state, then, the growth of love! is under great difficulties. The abounding charity which should encircle all hearts like a sun goes on crutches, or, limps in a very ungainly fashion."          X Florence was silent, and husband and wife fell again into contemplation. Life! life! what wap it, after all? How immense the universe, how small the grain of sand! How illimitable eternity! What a shadow our earthly existence! Some draw but a few fleeting breaths, and they are gone; some travel through their allotted span with toil and pain--suf- fering illumined with a little joy-and they, too, drop into the ground from which they were taken. The silver moon is setting, thought Florence; but we know it will rise again. We can count its changes, '         '      396     lRomance of the Tabce. and we know where it will be to-morrow; but where shall we be?" Then Florence stole softly to her husband's side, and, seating herself on a stool, slipped her hand into his, and laid her head upon his knee. Thomas passed his other hand over her brow and hair, and stooping pressed his lips to hers. "Life is love, darling 1" "Life is love!" Which spoke first, and which last, could hardly be told. They seemed to speak together, in language which belonged to a higher sphere of existence. Life is love! one sound, from an inseparable union of two hearts. One overwhelming expression of a great truth, realized, felt, understood. Life is love!   C IIAPTER X I V. THE COUNTRV TEA PARTY.

The Club had finally dissolved. Whatever may be the law of affinities in another life which keep people together, in this life it operates but weakly. The world is more powerful than the affections; the demands of business more exacting than the ties of kindred. So, coming together from diverse points; renewing for awhile, the delights of other days, the friends were sundered again by the forces which never cease to act, and which at last grow too powerful to be resisted. The Professor had not been present the last two evenings. Dr. Sollinger was in demand by a host of pale-faced invalids who looked to earth far more wishfully than to heaven. Dr. Lorton was also wanted by those who had a greater demand upon him than those with whom he was sojourning, and so came the parting, which though not looked upon as final, was the last of those farewells which in the olden time certainly presaged another meeting. There is no durability to any of the combinations we make in this life, and we can only be certain of this, that the     398     Romance of the Table. usefulness of the individual rneed never cease. The friends who in city and country had added to each others wealth of information, and enlarged' each others ideas of life and its field of usefulness, might not meet again as of yore, yet each might be if he chose the centre of another circle, and the mentor and teacher of other people. There is room enough for far more workers in the world than we have. "Before Dr. Lorton goes," said Florence to her husband, " let us have a tea party!" "And ask Dr. Primrose," said Thomas. "Yes, and Dr. May and Rosabel;" and a smile twinkled in a corner of Florence's eye, and almost broke into a laugh from the corners of her mouth.' "Has my wife become a match-maker!" cried Thomas, with mock sternness. "My dear, what- put that idea in your head?" replied the wife, the smile this time fairly illuminating her face like the sun. "Can we not have a young lady and gentleman to tea, without a nefarious design upon their happiness?" "Can we bring a spark and tinder together without fire? "Well, that we have nothing to do with. We are not bound to know anytli .. -- about the state of the affections of two young people., Besides, if I choose to make them happy by bringing them together, who is to either gainsay my right, or throw cold water on my laudable exertions?" "No one, in the present company at least, my dear!" "Weli, I will take the carriage and make my calls   The Country Tea Party.      399 tomorrow morning, and in the evening I will tell you what the arrangements are." "All, right," replied Thomas; " none but an anchor- ate would refuse your invitation to tea." And Thomas was quite right. The fame of Flor- ence's housekeeping had spread far and wide, and there was a lurking feeling of jealousy among the old-fashioned country dames over the reputation of a new comer, who, it was at first popularly supposed, was but an animated piece of city porcelain. It is astonishing how quickly information spreads in the country. The Mayhlews had not been in their house a month, before the notable housekeepers began to inquire of Thomas how she made bread; they had heard she had a new process of raising without yeast, and "would Mrs. Mayhew please tell me how she makes bird-nest pudding?"Florence's tea table with its flowers and fine cut glass and china-for Florence had her weaknesses-was a curiosity which every one was curious to see. At first there was a prevailing report that Mrs. Mayhew was extravagant, and people whose trade it is to condole and sympathise, won- dered "how Mr. Mayhew could stand it?" and they, "thought it was a shame, that it was, that so good a man should always be kept with his nose to the grindstone to enable his wife to keep -up appear- ances!" But these impressions gradually wore away. One by one even the plainest aud poorest neighbors had been invited to tea, and to their astonishment they found that Florence did not set as good a table for company as they did the nselves. In faCt she made little or no change in her arrangements, very sensibly     400    Romance of the Tabce. arguing that what was good enough for Thomas, was good enough for all the world. There was an increase in quantity, but not in quality. Her visitors then found out that Florence was one of the most econom- ical of women, without being stingy; that she never allowed anything to go to waste; that many de- licious little dishes were made of the remnants of other meals, and that the great charm in the house- keeping, was in having everything of the best quality, as well as in the surroundings. "I don't know why it is, said young Mrs. Pascal to her husband, as they were going home from one of these little sociable gatherings; I don't see how it is, that Mrs. Mayhew's teas are better than ours. We have more than she had, for when we had the minister to tea, I made myself a'most sick over cake and bis- cuits and you know we had enough left to last us a week." Mr. Pascal could not reply to his wife, for he really did not know himself. He was a plain, hearty, good- natured man, who believed that he could not do too much for a visitor, and he could not see whence came the nameless charm of the Mayhew mansion, yet he felt it. But I will tell the reader the secret. The Mayhew table was only, an aid to an end, and not the end itself. That end was the entertainment of the guests, and that was attained by 'cultivation. The Mayhews knew how to adapt themselves to all the different phases of character with which they came in contact. With the farmers, farming wras the chief topic, spiced with all those outside subjects with which farmers are more or less familiar, but on which they have but little opportunity to talk. Florence   /The Country Tea Parly.     401 with tact and intelligence made the female part of the company so much at home, that it was astonishing how fast the eveningt flew away; and this was accom- plished too, not so much by imparting ideas as by drawing out people to impart theirs. It is a mistaken fancy that only those who have the most education, should do the talking. It is for them to make other people talk and to feel that they are a part of the woild of thinkers as well as of listeners. But I am digressing, too far. Florence made her calls the next morning as had been agreed upon, and was courteously received. She was glad to find that Mr. May and Mr. Primrose had met more than once, since that eventful Sabbath. Mr. May had called on his brother minister, and thanked him for the service he hil performed, and Mr. Primrose had returned the call, and passed an hour in Mr. May's study. There the two Reverends had discussed polemics at great length, and Mr. May declared to his daughter the same evening, at the tea table, that: "' Mr. Primrose is eminently solund, my dear, eminently sound. He is well read in the Fathers, and is a daily student of the New Testament in the original Greek. Young and impetuous-wants the soberness of age, my dearl--but sound, eminently sound!"' This was very agreeable information to Florence, and when the Doctor and Rosabel graciously accepted the invitation, she went off as gay as a bird, of course. Mr. Primrose was very happy, and a couple of mem-, bers from each congregation with whom the Mayhews were on familiar terms, were equally pleased to make up the requisite number. 'The Magnums, Thomas 26     ,402    Romance of the Table. and Florence, and Mr. and Mrs. Williams, who formed as it were, a part of the family, made up the comple- ment. "Come early, " was the word, " do not come merely to tea, but come and let us have a little enjoyment before tea. Come and play croquet." Will it do for a minister to play croquet? Will it do for a minister to dance; to sing anything but hymns; to read Moore and such parts of Tennyson as the Idyls of the King? Each clergyman must answer for himself. Mr. Primrose played croquet, that is certai;. The May- hews had a delightful lawn, smooth as a i-floor, with a turf of velvety, softness and Mr. Primrose played cro- quet. He was a young man who cultivated his phys- ical as well as his mental powers. He was an adept in all athletic exercises, and could go over a five bar fence with a touch of one hand. He played croquet with grace and skill, and Rosabel played it with so little grace and skill that Mr. Primrose had his hands full to look after her ball and his own too. When he had become a "rover," which was in advance of all others, the game became exceedingly interesting, and it was quite astonishing how he managed to croquet his adversaries balls to remote parts of the field, while Rosabel was assisted to triumphantly march forward on a victorious career. But Mr. Primrose was sensible; and, after a couple of games on the lawn, he joined Mr. May and the older visitors on the piazza, and showed his skill equally there, in discussing those matters which were in a healthy progress of investigation. Thomas had arrived by an early train from town, and had brought   Th e Country Tea Party.     o403 the papers and all the latest news of the day. Then, as is the duty of American citizens, the affairs of Eiur- ope -ere discussed with more than the usual unanim- ity, and Emperors, Kings, and the Pope, came in for a share of po'ite attention. Books and authors too, were not forgotten, and Mr. Primrose not only showed himself familiar with the fathers of literature, but with the mothers, and he gave from  memory some of the verses of Hannah Moore, and that pretty poem of Mary Howitt's, commencing: I love the sunshine everywhere , -In wood, and field, and glen; I love it in the busy haunts Of town-imprisoned men;  I love it when it streameth in The humble cottage door, ,knl casts the chequered casement shade Upon the red brick floor. Rosabel was quiet, but what she said was to the point, and she was a most excellent listener. The hazy clouds in the western horizon were turn- ing themselves into all sorts of fantastic forms, and adorning themselves with all the colors of the rain- bow, as the company were called to the tea table. The children were playing their game of croquet, and their merry laughter floated with the breath of the roses, through the open window. There was a hush for a moment, as Mr. May reverently asked a bless-  ing, and then the hum of voices around the hospita- ble board broke out afresh, My readers do not need to be told that two thirds the success of an entertainment depends on a judi- cious placement of guests at the table, but it may surprise the younger portion to learn that Mr. Prim- rose was not seated by the side of Rosabel, but     404     Romance of the Table. between her father and Florence, while she was on the opposite side of the table. "If he wishes to entertain her, he can do so just as well there," Florence argued, "and the company a great deal better; and if he wishes a closer companionship he must be quick- witted enough to make his own opportunities." There was a great deal of theology discussed that evening, and a great many topics too, with which theology has much to do. And then from theology they passed to all the pleasant little topics which fill up the time, as the delicacies of the table make the feast pleasant with varieties. There was something wonderful in a cup of tea with its aromatic fragrance, as it passed from the hand of Florence to the expectant guest. It was suggestive of a dozen pleasant subjects; of a changing kaleidoscope of fancies; a mosaic of exuberant thoughts. Dr. May was a perfect encyclopaedia of knowledge, and to-day he seemed to have left all his ministerial starch at home, and to come down to the level of every comprehension. And then, when the tea was about over, there was a little significant tap of the bell, and presently six children came bounding in, rosy with health, excited with happiness, panting with expectation. They had had their own tea in the drawing-room, and were now introduced simply as a joy to the feast, and a relaxation to the minds of the elders. "Kindergarten! Kindergarten!" cried Mr. Primrose, "I see, Mrs. Mayhew, that you are a disciple of that dear old instructor of children, Froebei; he whose great soul was a garden of love for the children, and who turned their education from nettles to roses.   A  Country Tea Party.     405 You bring the children to your table to learn some- thing, I know, and yet the oldest of us can learn something from them. "I have always found," said Thomas, "that there ls no half-hour in which so much, and such agreeable instruction may be imparted, as at the table. My children have learned, for instance, all about spices, sugar, the constituent parts of milk, butter, flour, etc and have a very good idea of grains and the various processes through which they are passed in different parts of the world." "You are right," said Mr. May, and Froebel was right.   I /                 f     C  APTER    XV. AUTUMN LEAVES.

Heraucd So many essays have been written upon the beau- ties of the country at different seasons of the year, that I despair saying one word which has not already conveyed an idea to the world. And there is another consideration: The growth of the mind in any direc- tion depends on culture, or, I may say, habit. The artist who loves his profession, and works daily, finds himself insensibly nearing an ideal of perfection. Insensibly I say, yet if he compares his pictures at the end of the year with those he painted at the begin- ning, he will find his progress has been marked and positive. Now there is no genuine love for the coun- try in the mind of man or woman, city born, bred, and educated This is proven by the yearly rush to fashionable watering places; by over-crowded hotels and the devices there to kill time; by the rush home with the tide of fashion, just at that season when the country ceases to be beautiful and commences to be glorious. I have known thousands to be frightened   Autumn Leaves.      407 away by a cool day or two early in September, with such weeks yet to come! with such sunsets, and such mellcw tints in the landscape as a Van Dyke and a Rubens would have been crazy over! Why then should I set forth the beauties of the country to such as these? For to appreciate any beauty there must be an answering echo in the heart. We must agree, not only in the sentiment, but in the feeling which goes with the sentiment. I will tell you how to encourage a genuine love for the country-buy a piece of it! That is the only way. Choose well, or get some one to choose for you. Study health to begin with. If long a resident near the sea, go to the hills or mountains. Do not wait for wife and children to be so run down that they can enjoy nothing; or for yourself to have lost all the vigor of youth. The country is not always the place ;or consumptives, or for the asthmatic and rheumatic. Go, when you do go, determined to stay, without you find you have made an absolute mistake in your loca- tion or climate. Go where you have ample space to breathe; where the birds and the valleys give you perpetual changes in the lights and shadows upon your landscape; where there is something constantly to draw you out of your shell, and to soften and tone you down to an assimilation with your surround- ings; where the lowing herds, the cultivated farms, and the whistling locomotive allies you with life, yet where the town' is in the distance, and you are not perpetually reminded of the merchandise and the traffic over which your heart has grown callous. With such a start your future is hopeful, and in time may be blissful. Do not spend all your money     408    Romance of the Table. the first year, and then say how awfully dear it is to live in the country! It would be well for you if your plans were never entirely finished, that there might be something each year for your brain to contrive and hands to execute. Forget not that you are commenc- ing a new life and that you are to grow as well as your trees. Do not plant this year and pull up next, finding you have made a mistake. And then, as flower and shrub and tree begin to take root and grow; as the cherry and peach blossoms make your spring time beautiful, and the red leaves of your maples vie in the Fall with the sunsets; there will come such thrills of joy into your heart as you never felt when gazing at the landscapes of Hunting- don and Gignoux. You will realize the beauties of the country, being yourself a part of it. You will find the echos in your heart now; the echos of the birds; of the whispering of the trees; of the sigh which the waving corn transmits to the breeze; of the whip- poorwill and the katydid, who make the September evenings musical. Then look at your children, if you are so blessed. Look at their brown faces and happy eyes. Listen to their robust little voices as they make your home a paradise with healthy shout and jocund laughl Think of what they were, or might have been, in the city, then; puny, sickly, artificial; full of whims, and fan- cies, and wants which exhaust both the patience and the purse.

The heat and the dust of Summer have in a m'easure disappeared; the air is more bracing, the evenings longer, and a blanket at night is a wel- come addition to the bed; but oh! the lavishness of Nature now! She pours upon us the sunlight in a spray of gold, and all the rainbows of the Summer showers seem to have been solidified and scattered broadcast over the fields. If "Winter lingers in the lap of Spring," it is equally true that the sober Autumn keeps Winter long at bay, and tempts us with apple and pear, peach and plum, as though in defiance of the frosts and storms which are waiting on the threshold.

And it was on one of the magnificent Autumn nights, when the moon shone with unclouded lustre, the sun having gone down in his usual chariot of gold, that the Mayhews sat in their cosy drawing-room. There was an open fireplace, and a little fire splut- tered and crackled as though expostulating at having to do duty on so finqan evening. The open door to the dining-room showed the table there, as it had been left but a few moments before, and the clock on the mantle ticked cheerily, as though it were trying to keep up a conversation with the cricket, who was singing his song in some mysterious corner, which crickets can find much more easily than we can find them. The days of the Club, like days of all sublunary institutions, had been numbered, and had come to an end. Not but that there might be other re-unions, other talks; but the drawings of the great world are stronger than the ties of friendship, or the yearnings of the heart even. It is true, also, that in time, each man and woman, filled with the activities of life, become the center of their own circles, and the pro- moters of life and duty among those who are drawn, by the affinities or the necessities of their own natures, around them.

They looked at their growing children, and knew if they renewed their youth, it would be in them. They looked into each others faces, and saw that they were ripening for a world where the inner and the outer world correspond-but that world is not this. Yet there was not a particle of age, so called, about either Mayhew and his wife; only they, too, had mellowed as the Autumn fruit and foliage, age, and even the sun itself seem to mellow in October. They had a greater store of wit and wisdom than ever before; but it had a different character from what they possessed in their early youth. They spoke more slowly and more tenderly. They drew together with an innier consciousness of the necessity each was to the other. In youth they professed love for each other; in middle age they felt it. I wonder if people will understand me? Perhaps those will who gather aro' a hickory fire on an Autumn night. There is a great deal in having and enjoying similar associa- tions.

WILLIAMS' STORY.-"TEA IN OLD ENGLAND." it is very easy to pick out a bit of green sward in any part of the civilized world; wherever men have tastes to be gratified and money to spend, there will they build their castles and lay outltheir lawns, cost what they will; but it is only in England that we find the greensward a part of nature; the velvety turf as perfect around the cottage as around the castle. Not there do they have to plow and harrow and plant seed by the bushel; which, coming up, a little grass and a great many mongrel weeds, have to be ploughed in, sowed and harrowed, planted and rolled again, until we have got tne better of the perversities of the soil, and the weeds are not so thick but they can be pulled up by hand. And no prettier greensward, and no sweeter cottage- inn exist anywhere in the wide world than the Rose Inn, county of Cumberland. I do not remember what castle it was near, nor does it matter, for people going to that part of England go to see the lakes, not the castles; the little diamonds of lakes in their em- erald settings, where the shadows chase each other over crystal waters, and where the sward runs down to the water, and into the water, as though it and the lake were first cousins, and could not bear to live separate.     "4    Romance of the Table. The inn was an English inn of the very best qual- ity, and those who know what an English inn is, by absolute experience, will need no further description, and may skip this paragraph; but, as there may be a few here and there who do not know what an English inn-is like, and who form their opinions or ideas from the eating and drinking places at every cross-road in our own country, I must indulge myself in a few remembrances, which cluster around this very Rose Inn of which I am telling.  In the first place there was no " bar " attached to the house; no place where people stand up and guzzle vile potations until they are as red in the face as boiled lobsters, and as uncertain on their legs as though the latter were for ornament and not for use. There was a neat coffee-room, the floor brightly polished and the tables likewise; and here a man could have his pint of ale or sherry, and sit and drink like a gentleman. People do not often get fuddled when they take their drinks like gentlemen, although I by no means hold that out as an inducement to partake of the ardent. I am only pointing out the difference between the two countries. The Rose Inn was built of stone, with heavy facings to the windows, and an ample porch with seats on each side, and over the porch and around the win- dows, and clambering up to the eaves, were such a profusion of climbing roses as to justify the inn in its choice of a name; and there were honeysuckles too, running a race with the roses. If they did not beat in the race, they did in their fragrance, and it did seem every time a visitor sat down in that porch, that the honeysuckles and the roses shook their leaves as   Mr. Williams? Story.     4 5 the acolytes shake their censers, saying in their own language of flowers: "And please, sir, how do you like that?" But if the flowers did riot speak in the English tongue, Mary, the pretty waiter, did; and here I must really grow eloquent, old as I am, and as unsuitable as the subject may be to an old fellow like me, but I would defy any one not to feel all the greatness of the theme urging him to speak out, who knows the dif- ference between a bar-tender in America, reeking with the fumes of whisky, and a bright-eyed, rosy- cheeked, white-aproned English girl at a rural inn. There is absolutely no comparison to be made; for the man or boy is nowhere; he is out in the cold, as we say, and had better hide his shaggy head in the stable at once. "Do you wish dinner, sir? or tea, sir?" says Mary, the maid of the inn; and Mary trips before you to the sitting room, or the coffee room, as you may desire. If you order a meal, you will have to wait patiently for awhile-for all meals are cooked to order-but you will be repaid for the waiting. Such table-cloths and napkins! Such a broiled chop, or cutlet, or chicken! Such faultless glass and china! Such vegetables, fresh from the garden, and hot from the colander! And then to have that particular maid to place then; on the table before you, and then to ask you with her own rosy lips- "Is there anything else you would wish, sir!" The bedrooms and beds in an English inn are also perfect patterns of sweetness; I will not say cleanli- ness, for such a thing as uncleanliness coiud no more be associated with the Rose inn than with the blue     "6    Romance of the Table. sky after a summer shower. How linen could be made so white I never could tell, nor where the phys- ical strength could be found to rub and polish the furniture and the glass until, if a fugitive speck of dust should attempt to light thereupon, it would cer- tainly slip up and make a failure of it. - At the particular time I have in my mind there was quite a party at the Rose inn. Ladies and gentlemen who had come over from a neighborhood to spend the afternoon; to examine a bit of a ruin of an old con- vent or monastery; to have an English tea at the inn, and then to return by the light of an English moon. It was a very jolly party; overrunning with health, and full of the life which a sojourn in the north of England infuses into the system. They had come in two open carriages, holding four inside, two in the rumble behind, and two with the driver, if need be; and a party ot eight, thus traveling over the hills, drawn by two powerful English horses, are. bound to be merry; and you may readily believe that a merrier party of sixteen never tumbled, laughing and shouting, out of two English coaches, than the party that tum- bled into the Rose inn, on that particular afternoon, at six o'clock., The sight-seeing was all through with, and they were hungry as well as happy. Of course there was the tea all ready, for the party had sent word of their coming, and the table was spread in the dining room when they arrived; already spread with every nicety which an English larder can furnish, for a substantial meal there in the evening, though called a tea, would answer for any meal of the day for the hungriest man who might find his way there after a journey from the Chinese Wall. There   Mr. Williams' Story.     417 were chops, and chickens, and sweet-breads; a meat- pie hot, and a pork-pie cold. There, too, were great cold joints of beef and mutton, and an abundance of puddings, and tarts, and sweetmeats. The tea would have satisfied a Russian, and the milk was so near cream as to have passed for the pure article in any other country than England. Oh! it was a right merry party which gathered round the table at the Rose inn; and Mary, the maid, seemed to have found a sister as near like herself as though they were twins, and intended to live and die together. It was not the prettiest girl at the party that took the head of the table, on this occasion, and poured out tea, but the most matronly-a married lady, in fact, and the mother of four children-but you would have picked her out of all the company for the special duty of pouring the tea, had you been there, and not one of the laughing and giddy misses who were so fond of fun that they would have broken half the tea-cups before they had served tea the first time. In England a married woman don't grow old, she merely ripens and becomes motherly. Steadier than her unmarried sisters, and looked up to by them as an oracle, yet quite as ready for a holiday in an old ruin as the wildest of them. "Now be quiet, do!" pleaded the matron, her own eyes snapping with pleasure. "Now be quiet, do, girls, and don't break all the china before you are fairly at the table." "John," cried another, "do pass me the chicken. Oh, I am so hungry!" "Oh, haven't we had a jolly ride!"cried out a 27     "8     Romance of the 7able. young fellow they called Volney-"Tom, can't you sing?" "Sing, indeed!" rejoined Tom, a hearty, healthy, beef-eating young Englishman; "Sing, indeed, with a mouthful of pork-pie!" "And I," roared forth another, making a dive at a cold ham, "couldn't possibly think of anything but the celebrated American song;" and he roared out the words in a fine bass voice: 'Happy am I; From care am I free. Oh, why aren't you all As happy as me? From morning till night, With roast beef and ham, With puddings and pies, I would myself cram!" "Exactly," cried Volney; "sung by Simes Reeves, in the Opera of the Beggar's Daughter, five hundred nights to crowded houses. American, indeed!" As the provender disappeared, and the appetites were appeased, the fun grew uproarious, and the  conversation too much mixed up to be narrated. Then, with the table cleared and shoved into a corner, the little upright piano was called into requisition, and between singing and dancing an hour sped away, and the married folks said they must go home. Some had left their husbands and  some their children. The drive was a long one, the , night was dark, and& off they must and should go; and the mothers with husbands and babies were more than a match for tho'se who had neither. The bundling up and stowing away is something  that takes time, and the young turned out into the, ;V chill night air somewhat reluctantly. English days   Mr. Willams' Story.      419 may be bright and sunny, but the English nights are very apt to be damp and foggy, and those who are to be out in' open carriages are always provident enough to see that umbrellas, coats, shawls and com- forters are sufficient to answer for any emergency. In time, however, all were placed; some inside and some out; some with the driver, and some in the rumble; and off started the merry crowd, laughing and shouting as they went, leaving mistress and maid, stable-boys and men-servants, at the door, shouting their good-nights and "a pleasant ride home" to the disappearing visitors. And a pleasant ride home it was, only interrupted by one little incident. The wind had risen considerably, and the night was very dark, though not cold. Here and there on the road the lights glimmered from the windows of houses they were passing, and, even where it was very dark, the drivers and horses knew the road so well that the travelers only sang the louder or laughed the more merrily, having nothing else to do wherewith to pass the time. About midway to their destination the carriages crossed a bridge over a rapid little stream of water, which was dignified by the title of river, while any where else it would be hardly more than a brook. The river, such as it was, ran through a hilly and rather wild country, with a sparse and poor population. Just as one of the carriages crossed the bridge a sudden gust of wind came, and made free to take with it the bonnet of a young lady who sat in the rumble. "Oh, Charles!" said she to her brother, who was sit- ting by her side, "I have lost my bonnet!"     420     Romance of the Table. "Stop! Stop!" cried Charles to the driver "What's the row?" hoarsely grumbled out a voice from the interior, evidently proving by its tone that: the owner had just come from the land of Nod. "What is the matter, Alice?" said one of the  mothers, in her kindly way, and she started up and tried to peer into the rumble. "Oh, it's only the wind has carried off my bonnet." "Shall I get down and look for it?" said Charles. "You might as well look for a miser's conscience as for a chip straw bonnet on a dark night and in a gale," grumbled the bass voice from the inside. "Let it go!" cried all the voices in a chorus. "It is not worth looking for!" "Tie a kerchief on your head, love," said the mother, " and let it go; I dare say it has gone into the river, any way." Alice treated the matter lightly, and, laughing at the mishap, bound up her sunny locks as directed, and the coach was soon under headway, its fellow having long disappeared. Home was reached in an hour more, or homes, I should say, for the coaches dropped the merry crowd here and there until at last Alice, her brother and her sister, with one more, stood on their own threshold. "Bring in the shawls, Charles, and all the things," called out Alice to her brother, as she flew into the parlor, where a blazing fire in the grate welcomed the absentees, and where the husband, who did not go, snoozed contentedly in an arm-chair in the corner. Charles came trudging in shortly with his load all right, except one grey shawl which Alice had thrown   Mr. Williams' Story.     421 lightly across her shoulders in climbing into the rumble, and which she now missed for the first time. "Oh, Charlie!" exclaimed Alice, in a tone of dis- tress; "where is my shawl? You have only brought in the wraps!" "I have brought in all there was," said Charlie; "everything, even to a glove which you dropped in the rumble," and Charles held up the tiny evidence of his careful search. The sudden conviction came to the mind of Alice that the shawl had gone with the bonnet, and she said as much. "Well, it can't be helped," said Charlie, and what Charhe said, the rest echoed. "And, besides," said her sister, "somebody may pick both up and bring them in, looking for an owner, and a reward; and if not, they are not of much value." So the subject was dropped with only an occasional reference at the breakfast table, and for a day or two afterward. But the adventure, dying away in one quarter, had given life to a little excitement in another, " of which I will have to tell you in another chapter," said Mr. Williams, taking up an apple, "for your little ones can't keep their eyes open much longer without I fasten them open with pins."     CHAPTER    XVII. MR. WILLIAMS CONTINUES HS STORY. The gay party from the Rose inn did not g home any too soon, said Mr. Williams, resuming his story on the following evening. For the clouds followed the wind, and the rain followed the clouds- a drenching, pouring rain, such as frequently falls in the temperate climates with very little preliminary notice. The next morning opened bright and balmy; the sun shining out with more than its usual splendor. A mist hovered over the valleys and streams, the exhalations of the moist ground; and the swollen river rushed madly onward, as though anxious to get rid of the unusual burthen which the clouds had forced it to carry. The stream which the carriages had crossed was especially turbulent, and, being fed by innumerable little rivulets, had assumed a size and importance which the day before it had not dreamed of. It was very early in the morning, not more than five o'clock, when John Bowman, a young farmer, came sauntering, by the river-side. He merely wished to see whether the storm had not swept away the bridge or done some other damage; and he saunt- ered along with his hands in his pockets, whistling after the manner of people who are conscious that they are out early enough to be independent for an hour or two.   fMr, WiliaCms' Story Continzued.  423 But John's steps were very suddenly arrested, and his gaze was fastened upon something on the bank of the river. His mind was none of the quickest, but the superstitious part of his nature was immensely active, and the open mouth, dilated eyes and pro- jected head showed that the object he saw had not merely fascinated him, but had given a turn to his imagination which had twisted that and his brain together. The objects-for there were two-which had thus driven John Bowman almost out of his wits, were a lady's bonnet and shawl. "There's bean a murder dune here!" said John to himself, after he had stood in suspense for at least a quarter hour. "And they've thrown the lady in the river, and what's to be dune now?" John was in despair. Hs first impulse was to run away. "Who knows,' said John, "but if anybody comes this way and finds me 'ere, but they'd take me for the killer!" and the perspiration started to John's brow at the very thought. Then John pondered the subject over foi another, quarter hour, when he de- cided that he would keep his conscience clear, at any rate; that he would not touch either al;ticle, but would go and confide his secret and his troubles to the parson. "The parson's the man, said John, "as knows everything, and he will tell a fellow what to do;" and John hurried off without turning his face again toward the river, fearful that he might see something even more appalling, to confirm his fears, than the innocent cause lying by the bridge. The parson, who added to his spiritual charge of a Wesleyan societ- the profession of school-master, 1     424     Ronmance of te Table. might have known everything, as John said, but his nerves were by no means equal to his knowledge; and the communication which John made him, giving his surmise that somebody had been murdered, before stating the grounds of his suspicion, did not by any means add to his presence of mind. The poor man opened his eyes in astonishment, and gasped for breath. His first impulse was to saddle a horse for John, and send him twenty miles off for a magistrate. Then he thought it best not to delay so long, but to take neighbors enough to the spot to answer as witnesses, and make a search for the unfor- tunate victim. It is not an easy matter to confide such a thing as a supposed murder to a few persons in a quiet country hamlet, and the parson and John had hardly spoken to three persons before the news began to spread, with all the variations which village minds were suscepti- ble of giving it. The murder, from being a supposi- tion, had become a fact. Then the two articles lying on the river bank were transformed to two murders; then stout men began to feel themselves called upon to pursue the assassins, and commenced arming, principally with pitchforks, axes and hammers-more deadly weapons being very little in use. Then the women and children began to weep and wring their hands, frightened at the prospect of being left alone; the final result being that the entire population, men, women and children-some of the latter babies in arms-set off for the river-bank and the bridge, in pursuit of knowledge, and of the criminal in the deed of blood. The most timid are brave when well supported by   Mr. Wilizams' Story Continued.   45 numbers, and the courage of the villagers rose as they were joined by the neighbors who lived on the line of the procession. It was a queer looking army; even Falstaff never nustered a funnier. The captain, in dress of sober and rather seedy black, his white neckcloth the badge of his peaceful calling, was fol- lowed by a motley crowd of strong men, ialf-scared women and wholly-scared children, who clung to parental skirts with a fearful look of some impending catastrophe. The only happy members of the party were the babies who were being carried; who, too young to cull danger from the future, only knew that they were having an unusually long promenade in the fresh morning air, by the river-side; so they laughed and crowed, happily unconscious of the dreadful nature of the mission on which their grave papas and mammas wer* bound. The river was running rapidly, as tie bridge came in sight; and, as it foamed and roared around the abutments, it seemed anxious to tell the mighty secret it held within its dark bosom; and a spell of awe ahd silence fell upon the crowd, as, standing at a respectful distance, they saw the articles which had caused a moral earthquake in their simple hearts. "And Oh, lud!" exclaimed a young girl, whose inquisitive eyes had been actively at work; "And Oh, lud," if there isn't her veil a-lying close by the edge of the river!" A thrill of terror ran through the hearts of the assembly at this new discovery, and, sure enough, there lay on the wet grass a pretty green veil, so much fancied by young ladies who wish to save thiei eyes and complexions froin the sun and dust. 1*     .26 Romance of the Table. "I think," said the good pastor, "it would be well to ask the Divine guidance before going any further;" and all the people knelt down upon the grass, while a petition ascended to heaven. t We may smile, if we' please, at this simple act, with so little of a basis for any suspicion; yet in the minds of people who take no papers, and see very little of the world, all such events are classed among the most important of their lives. They had no doubt that a murder had been committed, and what to others might have appeared as of little importance, had to them all the weight of demonstrative evidence. There was one doubter in the ranks-the son of the squire. There did not happen to be even a knight or a baronet in the neighborhood, and the wealthiest landholder was the only one around whom circled the simple homage of the honest peasantry. The squire was a bluff, hearty Englishman, fond of his wife, his table, and his son; and, on each returning birthday of the latter, there was a great feast set forth, under the beaches; which, with a cask of ale-real home-brewed ale-made the villagers happy for a day. Hugh Harcourt was now a splendid specimen of what, physically, a man may attain to, who is fond of the sports of the field, and lives in harmony with Nature's laws at least; and at four and twenty a man enjoys life, if he ever does. *    Hugh was out this morning with his gun on his *   shoulder, he hardly knew what for. In fact, he felt more like enjoying the sweet breath of the morning than slaughtering the happy birds, and it was not the season for hares or rabbits. So Hugh, who was on a return from his morning walk, and was coming over j   Mr. Williams' Story Continued.   427 the bridge, just as the villagers arrived there, stood jn wondering astonishment at the unwonted sight. The young man hesitated-his presence was not noted-and his wonder increased as he saw the sol- emn introduction to what in other days might have been a religious rite or incantation. Then, as by an impulse he could not resist, he trotted over the bridge and joined the throng. "What's the matter, lads?" asked Hugh of the first men he came in contact with. "What's the matter domine!" said Hugh, with a smile and a nod to the parson, whom he now recognized. "Why, Master Hugh," said the pastor, "there's been a deed of some kind committed, we hardly know what yet, and of eourse there is much excite- ment among the people." "And where is the evidence, pray?" "There," said the worthy man, pointing to the arti- cles lying on the wet grass. "Oh," said Hugh, "I saw them and thought they belonged to some of the women folks here. Don't you know who they belong to, nor how they came here!" "We do not." Hugh stood musing for a moment and then he said: "Well, my good friends, I would advise you to pick up the bonnet and shawl and let them remain in charge of this good parson here, until time or investi- gation clears up the mystery. If any crime has been committed, the body will have been swept out to sea, possibly, or thrown ashore far below &ere. Get a couple of stout horses, if you will, and scour both sides of the stream for a few miles--"     423     Romance of the Table. "And would it not be well to have the river dragged, Master Hugh?" said a man who was noted as a fisherman. "Possibly the lass may have had weights tied to her, or she may have sunk without them." "As you will, lads," replied Hugh. "There will be no harm at any rate, even if no good comes of it, which I much doubt, still it may be a satisfaction. And I will ride over to town, while you are busy here, and consult a magistrate." "His honor is right," said the village school-mas- ter, who had not yet spoken. "His honor is right. Let us do all we can to satisfy the law as well as ohrselves, and there will be nothing to complain of by any one, nor by our own consciences." The advice seemed good to all, and as by this time there began to be a feeling that it was past the break- fast hour, the three articles were carefully picked up, the men were selected to ride down the river, and others to drag the stream, and the entire party started homeward, a good deal relieved in mind, if quite as full of wonderment as ever. Hugh Harcourt was the only one who remained behind. He had hiown ideas on the subject, and he wished to pursue his investigations by himself. As soon as the crowd left, therefore, he walked back to the bridge. The stream had efface d all tracks of wheels which might have been made in the night. Walking down the road, however, a few paces, he saw that a carriage had recently been halted, for the stamping of heavy horses was still plainly visible... But a still greater discovery was in store for him, shortly, for he had not walked a dozen paces further,   Mr. Willzams' Story Continued.   429 before he picked up a handkerchief, fine, hemstitched, and with three initials delicately embroidery in the corners: ,. AL. 6. "Oh, ho!" said Hugh to himself, and he whistled softly, "Oh, ho! . aL. (. ." and he stopped to think over all the names stowed away in his memory, com- prising either of those initials. "I wonder whether it belongs to Elston, or Eager, or ExeteT? No Tnat- ter, that belongs to me, and he put the delicate thread to a mystery in his pocket. "Those horses were stopped," said Hugh, " for something, and in the confusion a lady has dropped her handkerchief-that is certain--A. !, .! Hugh sought no further, but wended his way homeward. It is not necessary to say that the horsemen went down the river and returned as wise as they went, and that the river was dragged and yielded nothing but a few water sodden sticks, and the usual amount of weeds and mud. It is necessary to say, however, that Hugh Harcourt went to town and saw the magistrate, who, happening to be a personal friend of his, very readily agreed to keep the matter quiet for a few days, and permit Hugh to pursue his researches in his own way. "It may only pain some worthy family to have much made out of so trifling an incident:" and the magistrate thought so too. It is necessary, too, to say that Hugh's search was crowned with such complete success, that my next scene brings me to an English tea-table where there was a merry party, including Hugh Harcourt, the head of one of the wealthiest proprierties in Cumberland: and, there was, evidently, a story being told which     430    Romance of the Table. made a certain young lady's eyes grow very bright indeed, and there was a good deal more brightness and color in her face, too, than usual, as Hugh, rushing out into the hall, reappeared with a bonnet, a shawl and a green veil. "I don't know," said Hugh, before his saddledhorse was brought to the door that evening, "I don't know but that I, as a great discoverer, am entitled .to a reward." It was a pair of intensely blue English eyes that looked up into his, and a pair of intensely rosy lips that gave him his reward ere he rode back to his castle. ' 1   CHAPTER. XVI       I.

There was a pleasant gathering of the two families around the tea-table the evening following the last told story, and a lingering, long after the cloth had been removed  Quite an animated conversation had sprung up, in regard to the great variety of food which the earth produces for the sustenance of man and the usefulness of such a variety. "If Dr. Sollinger's theory is a true one," said Ada, "and could be faithfully carried out, of what use are all the beasts of the field, the birds of the air. and the fish in the sea?" 'As he is not here to answer for himself," replied Thonias, "it may be difficult to give his reply; but he would probably say, it is a man's business to live properly, without regard to the results on any order in creation." "Cobbett, the celebrated English reformer of the last century," said Mr. Williams, "wrote very wisely on, such subjects. I believe he was what we would now call a Grahamite. An objection was made to his O     432     Romance of the Table. theories, that, if we did not devour animals, they would multiply so fast as to be a calamity to man- kind. Cobbett replied, that, left to themselves, there would be no danger. They would only increase and multiply too fast for comfort, when domesticated. No one would be troubled with a superabundance of fish were they left undisturbed; and, as to birds, the passion both for hunting and eating game renders the severest laws necessary, in order to their preservation. There are some kinds of birds which are not hunted, yet which give no particular trouble. Cobbett thinks, with Dr. Sollinger, that it is a sensible man's business to look out for himself first, and not con- sider that he is a special instrument of Providence, to destroy what Providence has made." "There is a point, however, which the most philan- thropic being cannot get over," said Magnum; "the universal warfare which is kept up among the animal creation. Many of them are carniverous, and can only sustain life by taking it. The birds themselves are the most ferocious rascals; the strong attacking and killing the weak, and the weak robbing each other's nests of the eggs and young." "If that fact proves anything," replied Florence, u it proves this, that Nature has thus provided for her unreasoning creatures, and against their undue increase without man's help." "But we do not get rid of the seeming cruelty of the arrangement," said Ada. "No," said Thomas, "we do not, and my heart has been often pained, when witnessing the cruelties of dumb creatures to each other. There was an old philosopher, whose theory ran this wise: Animals   The Last Romance.       433 were first created; in the order, at least, narrated in the Sacred record. Man, coming last, was what he called a microcosm, or little universe; that is, in him. self, he comprised everything beneath him. As in the ascending scale of creation came man, the crown and apex of all, so, after that event, the outer elements of creation and the inner elements of man's mind began to work in harmony with each other. While man was pure, all animals lived in perfect peace; when man fell, then the animals, affected by his evils, began to quarrel, fight, and kill each other. They are only the mirror in which we see ourselves." "A very ingenious theory, and a plausible," said Mr. Williams. "Man's kindness and love bring out a corresponding affection; so, by training, he increases the ferocity of the creatures under him. In either case, the brute only reflects the mind of his master." "Well," chimed in Magnum, "these are very pretty theories; but, after all, and with our perverted appe- tites, if you please to call them so, the variety we have to choose from is very pleasant to the natural man, and I have my theory, too, that every dish upon our tables; every fruit and vegetable which we pick from the bush, shake from the tree, or pull from the ground, appeals to some particular taste or appetite, which would not be so well satisfied with anything else. We may satisfy the muscles and sinews with potatoes and hominy; but we do not administer satis- faction to all the senses, which a more generous diet brings into play." "There you are right," returned Mr. Williams; "yet we may carry that theory a little too far. The glutton eats after that theory to his destruction." 28     434    Romance of the Table. 4"lm1 15t a happy medium in everything," said Thomas; "and, until we arrive at a higher state of knowledge, as 'well as of life, I presume we shall con- tinue to eat and drink about as usual. It is wonder- ful, though, how the entire earth is rendered tributary to the stomach.' There are very few countries which do riot send us something." "And those which send us nothing to eat," said Magnum, " send the seasoning. If they have no meat. they send us mustard." "And pepper." "And salt." "And allspice." "'And cloves." "And cinnamon." "And ginger." "And nutmegs." "And Worcestershire sauce," cried Magnum, laughing; "for, when Nature stops, then man comes in and begins to mix all the condiments together, and sauces us, anchovys us, and chow-chows us; and gives us the heart-burn with patent pork pies and potted meats!" "There is a romance about the table, notwithstand. ing," said Thomas. "We have but to trust to our imaginations slightly, and we can see a Mandarin nodding to us out of a tea-cup; a yellow Cuban in a broad brimmed hat, popping his head out of the coffee-pot; a cross-legged Turk on the box of figs; an Irishman in the potato dish; a John Bull astride the roast; a Frenchman cooking the omelette, and a troop of people, of all climes, colors and languages,   The Last Romance.      435 tramping in with the courses, as they appear. If we lay the world under tribute, it strikes me that, with our food, the world should administer to our intel- lects as well as to our appetites." "And pray tell me, some one," said Florence, "what is meant, in Scripture, by our sitting down with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob?" "Among the ancients," replied Mr. Williams; the meal was of much more importance and far more ceremonious than with us, and was a means to an end; the formation of knowledge or the furtherance of affairs of life or State. It was a distinguished honor to sit down to eat with the wise, and as the imagery of the Bible is drawn from the customs of the people who at the time constituted the world, so in this and other cases the lesson is merely one which points to the envied associations of higher life. I dare say there is a deeper lesson too; we are taught that the appropriation of food corresponds to the acquisition of knowledge, and that even in a higher state we shall have something to learn." eThen you do not think," inquired Ada, that there is to be any direct pleasure derived from sitting down at table with the personages named?" "I confess I do not," replied Mr. Williams. I hardly think that in heaven the Jewish patriarchs are of much more importance than others, and if we admit that they are distinguished there, and that there is eating and drinking at tables, we must agree that Abraham, Isaac and Jacob would have time for noth- ing else but to entertain the christians daily arriving, and all anxious to have their turn."     436    Romance of the Table. 'Well," do you believe there is eating and drink- ing there?" "I am no better informed than the rest of the world. Judging from what we know here, I should say yes, for the table is the great mollifier of human- ity. It smooths away the wrinkles; it keeps alive sociability and promotes friendship, and it diminishes nervous fretfulness. We must remember too, that we not only feed the stomach, but the brain. See the flow of wit which follows the dinner. Mens tongues are unloosened, and they talk without effort. This fact is leading to many philososhical researches into the qualities of food, as applicable to the sustentation of the brain, and we may hereafter find articles adver- tised, especially to promote mental digestion and secretion. "The Queen of Sheba had all her strength taken away," said Magnum, "by the magnificence of Solo- mons table. 'There was no more spirit in her,' says the Sacred history, and I wonder if Solomon's diet had anything to do with his wisdom?" "Possibly," replied Thomas. "I do not know that there is much difference after all, between the ancients and the moderns. There were gluttons and wine-bibbers then as now; there were those who made the table a means of epicurean delights, and those who sought it mainly for its intellectual combi- nations. It is just so now. Perhaps with our intense commercial proclivities, we make eating and drink- ing a more heavy business than it was formerly, but it is still the means to an end of some kind, as it always has been. Around it clusters many of the dearest memories of our race. Ever since Christ   The Last Romance.      437 took his farewell supper with his disciples, there has been a feeling of reverence in the minds of many, and thus has arisen after Christ's example, the fashion of returning thanks, or asking a blessing." "It strikes me," said Mr. Williams. that we are only beginning to get into the mysteries of this ques- tion. I have often thought that Nature might have arranged matteis so as to make one meal a day, if not one a week, sufficient, and thus have avoided the' immense labor in preparing food, as well as the loss of time in eating it; but now I am beginning to think that there is a great deal hidden from us in regard to the true mission of the table." "I do not think," replied Magnum, "that man was born either to live alone or eat alone. Of all uncom- fortable sensations, that is about the most uncomfort- able, when, a stranger in a strange land, we sit down at a strange table to strans tl t t trange dinner. Then we know what home-sickness is, and all the flesh-pots of Egypt would not equal in satisfactory sweetness a dish of lentiles beneath the old roof-tree." "Yes," said Mr. Williams, "I remember my first dinner in a foreign land. It was in Liverpool. There was a cosy, comfortable look about the dining- room, and a blazing fire in the grate. An immense roast was on a carving-table which was rolled around the room before each guest, who was allowed to help himself. It came to me in due course, and for once I turned redder than the beef at the bungling effort I made to cut a slice artistically, and then as I sat there and ate alone, an obsequious waiter watching every mouthful, I felt more like crying than enjoying my- self."     438     Romance of the Table. (' The true romance of the table will never be writ l ten," said Thomas, ' until we live more rationally; un- til we awake to the fact that everything we do in this life has a bearing upon our spiritual state. Now we are full of hurry. We neither take time to eat, nor to digest; we eat hurriedly; talk hurriedly; live hur- riedly; die hurriedly. We hardly know what rela- tion earth has to heaven. With us it is always, we are going to be; we do not realize that we are." "True, most true," said Mr. Williams. The table would be one of the most potent instruments in the growth of the mind, if we took the time, and really cultivated it. As it is living to eat, is the law with some, and eating to live the law with others. The delicacy and refinement which should be a part thereof is ignored, as well as its usefullness in brings ing together and developing the social elements of our nature." "Breakfast, dinner, and tea," said Florence; "youth, manhood, old age. The morning, noon, and night of humanity; how quick they come; how swift they go! Life seems but a day when it is spent, a day with its three meals; too often gone through with in thankless haste. Truly exsitence is but little more, after all, than eating and sleeping, without every golden hour is improved.   CHAPTER XIX. 'THE AUTHOR BIDS ADIEU TO HS CHARACTERS.

Reader.-Well, here we are to the Nineteenth Chap- ter of Part Third, and for the life of me I cannot see what the winding up is to be. There has not been a genuine sensation in the whole book. There has been nobody crossed in love; there has been no elopement; no mother dying in convulsions, or father in a madhouse. In fact there is nothing at all in it but what we are familiar with in every-day life. Author.--You are quite right, and   I can only regret it if you are disappointed. Dora, in David Copperfield; you will remember, painted flowers that looked like everything except Nature; and, if I am only to have the compliment of copying Nature, I shall have to be satisfied with that. Many years ago there was a favorite actor in New York, whose tragic method of dying upon the stage created such a sensa- tion that his scenes of pathos, in enacting real life, were very little appreciated in comparison. It was the last terrific struggle; the break-neck fall; the     "O   Romxnce of t/  Table. clutching at the air; the death rattle, that the pit waited for. And it became a catch phrase, among the boys who were inclined to be sleepy during the per- formance, to say: "Wake me up when Kirby dies.' So you, dear reader, have possibly been waiting for the catastrophe, and are of course disappointed in finding none. Reader.-Well, do you really intend to kill off any of your characters, or can you give us a runaway match between Dr. Primrose and Rosabel? A bit of scandal now, with a minister for a hero, would make the book spicy. Author.-I dare say, but unfortunately for you, I do not know how to make people happy in that way. Unfortunately, too, the world is too full of the reality for me to add anything to its evils, through the aid of a lively imagination. So much is this the case, that I think I am deserving of a little credit for rescuing the fact from oblivion, that there is such a thing as virtue, and that some people possibly do lead happy and respectable lives. You are hearing of elopements and crimes of much greater magnitude daily; of divorces and other methods of getting rid of domestic troubles. Are they proper models for you to follow? Reader.-No, I should think not. Author.--I have endeavored to set before you some- thing which you may safely follow. Not the dry virtues merely, which are so often placed before us like mathematical outlines--cold and severely cor- rect; but virtues imbued with the vitality of a loving and useful life.   Adieu to the Characters.    441 Reader.-But you cannot leave your characters just as they are, can you? Author.-Why not? If we look, after all, at the majority of people, we find them leading the same lives, day after day, until time for them is no longer. Thomas and Florence, and all the others, are still living, and I can do nothing more with them, as illustrative characters. Their children have grown up with a love of Nature, which justifies the parents in selecting. a home in the country. Both, in their spheres, have endeavored to do something for human- ity, and make the world a little brighter for their coming. So Magnum and Ada can be found nestled under the shadow of a hill. They face the West, and sit daily, hand in hand, to watch the setting sun. Mag- num has become a famous fruit grower, and is equally famous for his hospitality and unbounded good nature. The parents of Florence and Thomas passed much of their time with their children, and await their rest, fully ripe for the harvest, and with a conscious- ness that they are blessed beyond ordinary mor- tals. The Professor is still alive, and the last we heard from him he was locked up in a laboratory, making experiments upon the illuminating qualities of the fire-fly. He is still in pursuit of the problem which he considers the greatest of the age-the identity of heat and motion. Vohlen is as good at a story as ever, and is the possessor of a fortune in as bright a family as one can meet with in a day's walk. He is the rival of Mag-     "2     Romance of the Tab&e. num in fruit growing, and the light of his segar is like the flame of a light-house, indicating a secure haven not far off. Dr. Sollinger has an establishment which is the Mecca of many unfortunates. Wives broken down with the cares of children and the too often unre- quited- labors of the household; young girls, waning into the transparent, waxy forms of disease and pre- mature decay; weary and worn out sojourners on the shores of time, with no love for the misty look-out of eternity; fragments of humanity thrown up from the great sea, full of aches and pains, whims and fancies; some soured by crosses; others fretful from disease; a few calm, quiet, resigned. Oh, what a little world is there! a chapter from the book of life, worth more, to the reflective, than all the books ever written, almost. And amid them all circulates the doctor, the one sole specimen of perfect physical health, with a mind at rest with itself and the outer world. The Reverend Mr. Primrose did marry Rosabel, so there was no chapter of romance to be picked up there. He had to be very patient, though-very patient for a long while. Rosabel developed into a comely woman, just such a one as a Christian minister ought to have for a help-mate. The good doctor, her father, is still the Ajax of his Church, defying the lightning of infidelity from whatever quarter it may come. I think he has softened down very much, however, and that his sermons have a great deal more life in them than formerly. There was, a two- year old Rosabel on his knee the other day, and per- haps she has had something to do with it.   CHAPTER XX. AND GOOD NIGHT TO THE REST OF THE WORLD. How fine has the day been, how bright was the sun, How lovely and joyful the course that he run, Though lie rose in a mist when his race he begun, And there followed some droppings of rain I But now the fair traveler's come to the West, His rays are all gold, and his beauties are best; He paints the sky gay as he sinks-to his rest, And foretells a bright rising again.-Dr. Isaac Watts. Breakfast, Dinner, Tea; Morning, Noon, Night. In endless succession the days revolve; yet, to us, who revolve with them, comes the end at last. There is no escape from Destiny; yet does the soul stoutly cling to the hope that it at least is immortal. Revela- tion is all one way; and Nature, in all her doings, is an open book, in which we read the same story. There is nothing within us, or without us, which does not point to the great spiritual sea, which daily takes into its broad bosom nearly one hundred thousand souls. The river is not lost where it disappears from view; the day dies with the darkness, but is born again with the morning; and, though the body fades and withers, turning at last to its kindred dust, there is ever springing up in the heart a conscious faith that the spirit of man can never die. Nothing is ever utterly lost. Natural substances change their forms constantly, and as constantly come to us again, instinct with life, beauty and power. Can we say, then, that, while matter is constantly revived, the     "4     Romance of the Table. spirit dies once and forever? that the invisible, which is, after all, the only part of us which truly lives, is the '? only part of us. which truly dies? So far as the Earth is concerned, however, there is  an end, and a final one. Not one single soul, of all the billions who lived upon it, has ever returned and occupied his body of clay. Horace truly said, Mors ultima linea rerum est. Death is the ultimate bound- ary of human affairs. Breakfast, Dinner, Tea! Our last meal is finally eaten; our last night comes; and the sun rises upon the past tense of the verb To be- I wzas. Reader mine; I have endeavored to set before you one phase of life, from which you may draw a moral. We dare say you can pick flaws in it; and I should, at least, like to have you try. When we seriously differ from an author, or from a character portrayed, we ought to feel an ambition within us to do better than the exemplar set forth, and to rise impervious to the weaknesses we have detected. For my part, I wish the world had a million of men superior to Thomas, and a million of wives far more patient and lovable than Florence. I have not found so many by pretty nearly the whole million; yet, if I thought they were living, I should be happy; and I shall be happy too, if, here and there, a few young people may read my book, and resolve that they will do their best to be as good as they, at least, and better, if God gives them strength to fight the good fight successfully. The last time I saw the Mayhews was on a beau- tiful afternoon in the latter part of summer. They were sitting on a balcony, facing the West. The sun was setting, and the clouds hung in massive curtains,   Good ANight.       445 forming a portal through which the sun passed to its disappearance. I never beheld such a display of heavenly pyrotechnics; earth and sky were alive with color. 'Their children sat upon the steps of the piazza, and, with wondering eyes, gazed at the transformation that was going on in the sky and clouds. "We are following the sun to its setting, Thomas," said Florence, quietly. The clouds that are now so brilliant will soon be grey and cold, and then comes the night." "Yes," replied her husband; "but the sun will rise again, and so shall we. Night is but the bridge. between two days, and death the night between two worlds." "It is not always easy to say good night, is it?" "True, not always." We may meet again some day, dear reader; yet I say good night reluctantly. We have had our three meals together, and the sun is setting: - -'Hey^i? ^ '-   dW8^
