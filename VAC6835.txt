Origin of the ccaneers-Te. settlekments in Hispaniola. WHEN Spain discovered the West Indies and America in 1492, she regarded the New  World as her especial property, and by way of securing it to her-possession against all other aspirants or interlopers whatever she appied to the Pope of Rome} who had then a voice potential in the concerns of kingdoms, for a special d perpetual title to the western hemisphere and all its dependencies. As Spain was at that time the most devout as well the most magnificent of Catholic nations, and as the Borgia, who could So well appreciate the persua- sion of a gift, was at that time upon the Papal throne, Spain accom- plished her demands, and Alexander VI. gave in her favor, the cele- brated bull .which has since. been the subject of so much derision to the world.  With all her devotion, however, and all her reliance upon the sacerdotal rescript, Spain had yet noulgh of worldly doubt of the papal strength, to consider it necessary to take some worldly measures to make doubly secure the munificent possessions she had gained. She therefore detelmined to reserve the new regions exclusive to her- self and to her own ships, and though it may niow seem incredible in folly, se for a time actually fancied that she could keep the discovery of those regions secret from the rest of the world, and prevent the ips of other nations from finding their way thither. dispose of her cargo, or such part of it as m ight e wanted in the way of traffic. T he Spaniards were overcome twith rage and astonishment at this ospecimen of audcity and impudence, and the Governor, in a paroxysm of indignation, ordered the guns of the castle to be opened on her. The English were very glad to sheer off, and ve glad also, not to makle  any coYnplaint of th e maritime outrage. to Vie provoca. tion of the then superior naval power of Spain. Oni the other hand, the news of the penetration 6f the English ship among  their rich pos- sessions, caused great inquietude in Spain; and the G overnor of tihe castle of' St. Domingo was repriim andcd because he had not seduced the ship in port and seized her crew, that none might have returned to Europe to tell of the route to the Canaan of the western seas. /    6         MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER. But the English ship did return and spread her news,and other ships and their crows who had exchanged with the natives of the various islands for gold, went and came from the new seas, and in a few more years the French had made voyages to the Brazils, and as early as 1526, there were English settlements on some of the islands of the Gulf. The voyages of the French and English traders, were however, always performed in peril of the hovering Spanish cruisers, and as, when taken, they were treated with indiscriminate brutality whole crews being frequently put to the sword-the most bitter hatred grew up in the bosoms of the seamen of all nations, against this bloody and unscrupulous oppressor. Instead, therefore, of contenting them- selves with preparing for resistanrce, when attacked by the Spanish power, they armed themselves to be offensive, and whenever, while on these West Indian voyages, they would come across a Spanish trader weaker than themselves, they would seize her and retaliate upon her crew, or seize any chance that offered to land and make a depreda- tion on the hamlets of the shore. To repress these interlopers, the Spaniards adopted a special water-police in the shape of a number of new armed ships, which they'called guacrda-costas, the commanders of which were charged to display the utmost vigilance, and on no occa- sion "to bring home any prisoners 1" Such a sanguinary and inhuman direction as this, could not fEil to breed a corresponding offset. Inflamed by the wrongs which they suffered for merely pursuing those honest instincts of trade which were fiee to be followed in every other portion of the globe, the various European traders formed confederations, and combining themselves at times into fleets, made descents upon various parts of the Spanish coasts, and ravaged the towns and settlements. Withdrawing then with their spoil, they would sail for some port without population to disturb or oversee them, and give loose to the revels so natural to sea- men of every land. Prolonging these stays upon the land, these com- munities would build themselves temporary habitations, and obliging the soft natives to the, meaner labors of the household, give themselves up to the pleasures and profits of the chase. The larger islands abound- ed in wild cattle, and it was soon discovered by thoe acute-observers, that their dried flesh and preserved skins would be a very profitable article of trade. Accordingly, factories were erected on the northern portions of Hispaniola, which teemed with the wild herds, and seasons of hunting, salting, and drying, were followed by voyages of traffic, alternatingr with armed and buccaneer descents. As time advanced, these singular h-alf hunting, half roving, hermaphrodite communities increased. European traders who once struck these alluring latitudes, became fascinated with their license, and contented with their new rofits, and forgetting in the new associations all the visionary ties of home, lived as though they had'no interests or government save what centered among themselves. Bred of new circumstances they became a new race of men, and were preparing themselves for deeds that were to astonish those whose education could not comprehend their mode oft life.                -   X It mattered ot what took place in Europe; in the West Indies war J   MORGAN, TEE BUCCANEER.          7 was perpetual, and Europeans were always in combination against the common oppressor. Spain, in endeavoring by a religious pretext to shut the human family from an entire hemisphere which the Creator had given for the use of man, had not scrupled to murder and destroy, and now the cry of murder and destruction was on the face of waters against her; and those whom she had smitten with her guarda-costas, were now awing her towns and frightening her ships, under the name of "Brethren of the Coast." At length, the Brethren of the Coast had. become so strong and so pertinacious in their annoyances, that the Spanish government consider.- ed itself very much abused, and complained to the different Courts of Europe, of which the freebooters were the original subjects. But these governments, with the exception of England, tamely replied, that "the people complained of acted entirely on their responsibility, and that the king of Spain was at liberty to proceed against them according to his pleasure." England, however, replied with spirit, that "Spain had drawn these inconveniences upon herself, by her severe and unjust dealings in her American commerce ;"Elizabeth, who was then upon the English throne, further adding, that "she did not acknowledge the 'Spaniards to have any title by donation of the Pope of Rome, to any places whatever they were not in actual possession of; and it was absurd to assume, that the fact of having touched here and there with their vessels upon a coast, could give them exclusive property, except to parts which they actually settled and continued to inhabit." This threw Spain's trouble back upon her hands, and she was forced to repel for herself, the nest of wasps which she had brought about her ears. The Brethren of the Coast were first known by the general term of "Flibustiers," which is supposed to be nothing but the French sailor's corruption of our word "freebooter,", but the derivation of the term "buccaneer," by which they were afterwards designated, and ever since been known, is of more curious origin. The flesh of the cattle killed by these singular hunters, was cured at their establishments on shore, in a manner which they learned from the Carribee Indians. The meat was cut from the animal in strips, and laid to be'dried upon a wooden grate or hurdle, which the Indians called a barbecu, and which was placed at a good distance from a slow fire. This meat when cured was called boucan, and the same name was given to the place where it was cooked. From boucan comes the derivative boucanier, which being a little anglicized, settles at length, into the familiar term of bucca- neer. This curious association, that united the calling of hunters and cruisers, was held together by a very simple code of laws and regula- tions. Every member was expected to have his chosen and declared comrade, between whom property was in common while they lived together, and when one of the two died, the other succeeded to what- ever he possessed. This, however, was not a compulsory regulations but rather a maxim than a law, for the Buccaneers being, after all, men of the ordinary human inclinations, were often known to bequeath by will, to their friends and 'relatives in Europe.     8         MROGAIN, THE BUCCANEB R CHAPTER II. Sir iHenry Morgan, the Chief of the Freebooters--Capture of St. Catharinmes -Descent of the Pitatcs upon the Mosquito Coast-The ravage of Puerto del .r incipe. HENRY MORGAN, the great leaier of the pirates of the Antilles, was born in Wales. Ilis father was a farmer of good standing, but the son not liking the dull work of a rural life, early set out-for the sea coast to seek an employment iore suitable to his aspiring humor. He found in the harbor of Liverpool several vessels bound for that region of enchantment known as the est Indies, and making a bargain to his mind for a seaman's situation on board a ship bound for Barbadoes, he set sail in 1655 for that part. According to a practice very common at that time in those lawless waters, he was sold into service by the master of the vessel on arrival at its destination, and the ship itself was mustered by the virtuous commander, Who thus disposed of him, into the service of the Buccaneers, who then held their rendezvous and head-quarters in the island of Tortuga. oppressed him. The period for whichh he had been sold was but three years ; but shortening the term by dint of extra diligence, he set out for Jamaica to seek new fortunes. The island of Jamaica had at that time just come into possession of England, who had conquered it from Spain, and the change in .its ownership madte it at once a refuge for the Buccaneers, most of whom were English subjects, and a11 of whom, inasmuch as they harassed the Spaniard, who was the common enelmy, were regarded at that place with f{avor. his residence in Barbadoes had made Morgan familiar with much of the history of the freebooters, and the glowing tales of plunder and conquest which now and then were retailed as the current deeds of those astonishing marauders, had inflatied him with a desire to follow their vocation. tie was, therefore, not long in Jamaica before he had made an engagement as a hand on board a buccaneer ship. which at that time was on the point of sailing in corim- pany of another, on a trip of depredation. The voyage of the free- booters wan fortunate; Morgan showed himself not only brave but discreet, and he returned with high opinions of his address from all observers. Whit elevated him most highly in the minds of the older pirates was, that he showed nonec of the ordinary fastidiousness of green men to the sight of blood, or the work of slaughter. Three or four more voyages so increased his reputation, that he was enabled to raise sufficient money on his credit, to form an organization for the building  of a vessel for a party of his own, which vessel being finished, was set afloat with him for her commander, by a unanimous Vote. With this vessel he cruised on the coasts and along the bay of   MORAN, THE BUCXANEER. Campeachy, taking several Spanish ships in a few months, and return- ing triumphant with a large amount of plunder and a deal of renown. On the return of this expedition, he met at Jamaica the captain who had brought him from Liverpool and sold him at Barbadoes, and hail- ing him in the street, he drew his hanger and made 41 onslaught upon him, making no hesitation to the attack though he at the time was alone, and his enemy accompanied by two companions. The combat, which began as a single-handed fight, soon increased, therefore, with all the odds against Morgan; but having by a fortunate blow struck the arm from the captain, he was enabled to engage the second com- batant, just as the opportune arrival of one of his own mnen took in hand the third. The battle was speedily decided, and Morgan was enabled in: a few minutes to shake the hand of his trusty follower in congratulation of his opportune arrival, over the dead bodies of his three opposers. No special enterprise offering to his circumscribed force, Morgan at this time yielded to the overtures of Pierre Mansvelt, the most power- ful chief of all the Buccaneers, and, with a shrewd view at the future, accepted the position of Vice-Admiral, or second in command of tho pirate fleet. As soon as Morgan took this position under Mansvelt, he proposed one of those daring schemes which betrayed the comprehensive cha- racter of his mind, and proved him fit, in genius, for a better position than captain in a swarm of buccaneers. He took a bold survey of the condition of the freebooters; he saw the number of their ships, the state of their numerical power, and revolved in his mind, that if, as mere pirates upon Spanish commerce, and without any stable posses- sions of their own, they could lay cities under tribute, and hold in awe the entire Carribean Sea, they might, if they possessed themselves of an established territory, found an independent nation, and lay out'the beginnings of a new and heroic race. The island of St. Catharine's, one of the western Antilles, near the coast of Guatemala, was well suited for such a state, and to that impregnable and convenient refuge the riches of their spoil could be deposited, and the abducted virgins brought, who were to be the mothers of a new race of heroes. Mans- velt, though colder in his disposition than his lieutenant, was dazzled with this bold conception, and soon, in accordance with Morgan's sug- gestions, their fleet, consisting of fifteen vessels and five hundred men, was under way for the capture of St. Catharine's. The attack of the Freebooters could not be resisted. They soon forced the garrison to surrender, and of the forts and castles in their possession, they demolished all but one. In this one, they placed one hundred men, and enough males and females taken from the Spaniards to serve for the various purposes of the garrison. They then crossed' to the' adjoining island, now called Old Providence," and having laid that waste with fire and sword,. as they had the first, set sail with their ships stored full of prisoners whom they did not wish to remain behind to concentrate against the little garrison. It was'Mansvelt's wish to cut the throats of these people, but it was owing to Morgan's inter-     10        MORqGAN, TAE BUCCANEERB ference that they were conveyed safely to the continent, and set alive on shore. We shall see that his policy and tastes in this delicate regard, were destined to a most thorough change./    ' After landing the captives they had taken, naked of clothes, both females as well as males, the fleet cruised along the shores of the Mosquito Gulf, until they came to the river Colla, more recently one of the mouths of the St. John, with the design to pillage all the settle- ments in those parts, and thence to sail up to the town of Nata, from the sacking of which they expected a rich booty.  It happened, however, that the governor of Panama received ad- vice of their movements, and gathering hastily a large body of armed men, crossed to the gulf side of the Isthmus to exterminate them or, drive them to their ships. His coming ,was announced to the pirates. in time for them to make a secure retreat, a movement which was re- sisted by Morgan, though the force of the freebooters was, to the governor's troops, but as one to five. From the Colla river the Buccaneers then returned to St. Catharine's, when they found the large island in a good state of defence, and the smaller one, already bearing in its newly laid out plantations, sufficient crops to re-victual the entire fleet, They were now ready for an in- crease to their colony, and the two leaders of the enterprise, with the acuteness of two modern speculators in town lots, sailed with the squadron for Jamaica, to hold out inducements to the lawless spirits of their vocation, to settle in the new commonwealth, and avail them- selves of permanent domestic comforts, through the medium of the wives whom they might seize and adopt from any Spanish port. This was the original idea of Mansvelt and Morgan when they set out for Jamaica from St. Catharine's, but Mansvelt on the voyage changed his views, and applied directly to the new English governor of Jamaica for a portion of his force to be loaned to their purposes, and for the defence of the new state. But as Mansvelt would not promise absolute allegience to the English crown, and as the governor, though allowed to countenance them as enemies of Spanish commerce, feared a re- primand if he should enter into any open coalition with them, he rejected the proposal. In the meantime, however, Morgan with a wise spirit, fitted out a good sized ship, filled with provisions, and contain- ing some French and English colonists, and despatched it to the newly conquered place .with word that the fleet, after a short exploit, would be there after it. The squadron then sailed for Tortuga, but shortly after its arrival, Mansvelt suddenly died, and left Morgan to be select- ea by acclamation in his place. Meanwhile, things were not going well with the newly founded state. The governor of Costa Rica, in Central America, not liking a nest of pirates to be so near his coast, fitted out a powerful expedition' to re-take the island of St. Catharine's. Before he used violence, how- ever, he summoned Le Sieur Simon, the chieftain in command, to sur- render, aa a measure of necessity as well as prudence, and offered hint an enormous bribe if he would deliver the place up quietly, without the cost of bloodshed. The buccaneer for a time, resisted the tempta-   MiORGAN, l'PE BUCCANEER.        i tion, but at length, seeing no remedy, lie yielded after a sham resist 'alce and even deeoyed the English ship, sent from Jamaica i le6Vies and supplies, into the port, and delivered her up to the Spanfish conqueror. This result disposed for the time of all Morgan s ambitious views of placing himself at the head of an independent nation of free. booter, and directed his attention back to the ordinary exploits of his vocation. Finding himself now at the head of all the active operations of the Buccaneers, Capt. Morgan considered it necessary to signalize his Dew command with sopre great exploit, whereupon he sent despatches to the different islands, and ordered a rendezvous in -one of the ports in the southern side of Cuba, to hold a general council in relation to an expedition of importance. I three-months tinme after the ful inati6d of thisorder, he had collected in a natural cove near Bayame, 'a fleet of fourteen sail, and seven hundred fighting men, pretty equally divided between English and French. On the council being h, an opinions asked for, some proposed that an expedition be started again e othe oity of eavana; otheJrs proposed Puerto del Principe, others still, te city ofSt. Jago or St. Jaes, al on the Island of Cuba. Whenall the opinions had been given in, Morgan rose and gave his preference to the second, endorsinig the representations of a Portuguese, that as the inhabitants conducted their trade almost entirely in ready money, and as the place had never been sacked by the pirates owing to its dis. tance from the sea, the inhabitants were very rich, and thqir stores of gold would Tanish a magnificet reward to their enterprise and valor. bhe decisioni was still further clenched, in the minds of those who re- ceived it, by the report of the beauty of its women, whereupon a nearly unanimrnous voice decided in its favor. rThe fleet being all ready, set sail, and, in the month of May, 1666, entered the bay of Santa Maria; which commanded the road to the city. While lying at anchor on the evening previous to the deharka. tion a Spaniish boy. who had been kept as a servant on board Morgan's ship, swam to teshore andhurrying t' the tdwn, gave notice of the arrival of. the expedition. The Spaniards atonce prepared for their defence and at. the same time took recaution against the disasters of defeat by hiding all their jewels .nd valuable property. The gover- nor then summoned all the freemen of the town, and with a large number of slaves to aid them, took position in a narrow place on th roadwhre pirates were obliged to pass, and perplexed the passage stil'the more, by cutting dewn trees and blocking up the way. They  also prepared several ambuscades where cannon were securely planted. to harass them on the march. He had in all, a force-of eight hundred nfn, part of which were distributed along the line of the advance, while the greater portion wer,? drawn up in a spacious field which lay before the town, to makce final resistance for the protection of what was so dear to them within it. Morgan, however, suffered but two of these discharges fromh the amnbuscades before he discovered the dangers which lay before him, so he took a' circuit to avoid the harassment prepared fr him, and withont further interruption, met the main body of the Spaniards'  as they were drawn- up before the city walls. As the ravenous bauds     12        MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER.  debouched upon the plain, the governor detached a troop of horse to attack them in the front, but forming his men with inimitable skill in the shape of a semi-circle, the pirate chief received the charges undis- turbed, and at every onset of the Spaniard, repulsed him with the severet loss. When they came to the melee with the main body, the slaughter began in earnest, and the governor soon falling at the head of his troops, the rest of the Spaniards were seized with panic, and in their wretched disorder, were most part of them put to the sword. After this victory, the town was defended but four hours longer, and the vile conquerors slept in the couches of those whom they had slain Before, however, they gave themselves up to license and repose, they took all the remaining men and women of Puerto del Principe, except such of the latter as they had singled out for a worse purpose, and locked them up in three large cathedrals, and placed a guard over each, to prevent their egress to disturb their revels. The license and excesses of these lawless wretches then continued for several days, during which, the condition of. the captives in the churches was forgotten, and many of them perished through starvation. At length, becoming sated with their pleasures, and pillage and provi- sions growing scarce, the pirates concluded to withdraw, and were the more inclined to do this with some speed, as they learned from a negro, whom they intercepted with despatches to the captives, that the Governor of St. Jago was advancing with a large expedition for the relief of the town. Upon this intelligence, Morgan put many of the chief prisoners to the torture, to discover where they had hid their ewels, but owing to the press of time, was obliged finally to accept a compromise with his demands, in the way of ransom, of five hundred oxen, to be killed and salted, and conveyed by the inhabitants on board of his ships. This work occupied some three or four days, and together with the embarkation of the plunder, afforded a scene of the liveliest bustle. During the slaughtering and salting of the beeves, a circumstance arose, which showed the resolution of Morgan's charac- ter, and at the same time evinces in a strong manner the degree,of power which he exercised over his bands; An English Buccaneer en- gaged in the preparation of the beeves, stole the marrow bones belong- ing to an animal which a French freebooter had mi chrge. Enraged at the loss of what he so much prized, the Frenchmlan overhauled the depredator and challenged him to a duel for the outrage. The English- man agreed, but in walking to the place assigned for the combat, he treacherously stabbed the Frenchman in the back and slew him on the spot. On the case coining to the ears of Morgan, he put the murderer in irons, and on airiving at Jamaica, hung him in chains, as an example to the fleet. This piece of justice practised on his own countrymant gave great pleasure to the French, and was received with satisfaction by the entire squadron. On examining the booty of this expedition, it was discovered they had obtained a plunder of fifty thousand pieces of eight, in money and in goods, whereupon in chagrin at such a small result, it was at once determined that they should re victual and sail immediately for the rich city of Porto Bello on the Spanish Main. *   ,              \ -   MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER.          13 CHAPTER    III. New Expedition of the Pirate Chief-The attack on Porto Bello-Horrible atrocities on the Nuns-The Pirates repulse the Governob of Panama- The'ransom of the City. NOTWITHSTANDING the satisfaction which Morgan's public execution of the Englishman who stabbed the French Buccaneer gave to the French pirates of his squadron, the jealousy that had existed between them and the English was not appeased, and hard upon the division of the spoil of Principe, the French buccaneers withdrew from the fleet in a body, and sailed with a few small vessels they had purchased, in the direction of Tortugas. Notwithstanding his power was thus reduced, Morgan was not in the least degree discouraged, but by way of flattering his men with an evidence of his high opinion of their qualities and courage, he resolved to undertake an expedition yet more bold and audacious than he had ever attempted with his undiminished force. Nevertheless, he did not think it unwise to recruit as much as possible, and therefore announced in the harbor of Jamaica that he, had a grand enterprise on foot, and all those who chose to join him by a certain day, should be certain of a magnificent reward in the way'of booty and beauty. At this announcement, many Englishmen who had been rusting in idleness, were inflamed with the desire of sailing under the conqueror of St. Catharine's and Principe, and joined his fleet in numbers almost sufficient to repair the defection of the French. Everything being ready, the pirate chief set sail from the harbor of Jamaica, giving no notice, even to his second in command, as to what destination he was bound for, replying to all inquiries that if he kept the secret to himself, they would not suffer the evil of being reported to their enemies in advance, as had been the case at Principe. These words gave satisfaction to the buccaneers, and without caring whether it were to Havana, or even San Domingo, the head-quarters of the Spanish power, they were bound, gave themselves up to wassail until thie hour should conme when their swords would be required for slaugh- ter. - Froth Jamaica, the fleet steered downward through the Crystal Carribean towards the continent, and in a few days landed at tosta Rica, on that portion of the isthmus which is narrowest between the oceans. Here, sunmmoning his bands together at a council which he held on shore, Morgan opened his intentions and informed his men that his attack was to be directed to the rich city of Porto Bello, a few miles below. At this announcement a shout of satisfaction burst forth, and the pirates drew their swords and clashed them together in savage ecstasy. Porto-Bello was at that time to Panama what Chagres is at the pre- sent day. It lay in a direct line from Panama, on this side of the isthmus, and Wias the Atlantic termination of a road between the oceans, but forty miles across. Its beautiful harbor regularly received the heavily laden galleons from Old Spain, and across this road were     "        MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER. transported to Panama, to be distributed at Peru and other portions of the Pacific coasts, the stuffs and merchandise from Spanish work- shops. Returning back, in exchange for these commodities, would come the gold and pearls of the Pacific, and the spices and silks of India. As the recipients of such a trade as this, Panama and Porto Bello became necessarily two of the richest. and; most powerful cities in all Spanish America, and their opulent limits were defended by fortifications of the most formidable character. The city of Porto "Bello, lying within the danger of attack on the Atlantic side, from the maritime powers of Europe, was the most strongly fortified of the two, and next to Havana, it was accounted the best fortified city possessed in that regi'on by the King of Spain. Two castles in that age deemed impregnable, were situated at' the en' trance of its port, so that no boat or ship could enter the harbor with- out being raked, while at convenient eminences-in the rear of the town, cannon were planted to contribute to the annoyance of the presump- tuous invader. The part of the coast where Morgan landed, was in , small harbor a few miles,from the part of his destination, where, leaving, a few men to take care of the ships, he embarked the body of his force in boats, and taking with him a guide who knew the entrances of the city, set out at midnight for the assault.  It was not yet daybreak when the pirates neared the place. When within a short distance, a company of four, men was deputed to steal forward in the gloom, and seize the sentinel before he could give the alarm. This feat was successfully accomplished, and the sentinel was made to furnish the knowledge, of which the former guide was deficient. Marching with great care for a quarter of a league further, the were enabled to surround the nearest castle, whereupon Morgan, by th mouth of the sentinel, commanded it to surrender at discretion, or to Submit, in case of defeat, to perish without quarter. The Spaniards of that age were not, however, of the stuff to yield to menace merely S they it once opeiied a fire that alarmed the city. Rushing to the ault upon this provocation, the pirates with their headlong valor soon took the place; whereupon, to make good their words, and by way also of striking a wholesome terror iito the other defenders of the town, they put all the garrison, whom they had not slain in the light, into a single room, and setting a slow match to the magazine blew the entire edifice and all of its inmates, into the air. Following up the panic created by this- terrible atrocity, they fell upon the city before the preparations to receive them were half made, and drove a the hasty levies that were gathering to oppose them into a helter-skelter flight. While this was going on, those of the inhabitants who had not taken arms, were engaged in casting their jewels .into the wells and cisterns, or burying these treasures in the ground. The governor of the city, finding everything in such confusion that he could not tall the towns-people, or form such of them as were staunch, into any use ful order, retired to the main castle, determined to defend that poil to the last, and to sell'himself as dearly as he could. About this stronghold then the battle concentrated all its rage, at   MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER.         16 underneath the walls the strife continued fromn daybreak until noon. The contest was becoming doubtful;, the desperate Spaniards hurled down heavy stones upon the murderous assailants, and also threw among them earthen pots, filled with powder, many of whidh exploded among the,Buccaneers with terrible effect. In return, the pirates used fire-balls, which they threw with their hands against the wooden doors of the citadel, in the hope of burning them through. But failing in this, as in all their other efforts, they were about withdrawing in despair, when an idea struck the mind of Morgan, which inspired him with new hope. He ordered broad ladders to be made to scale the walls, and gave directions that they should be so constructed, as to enable four persons to ascend them side by side. This work being oompleted, he ordered the monks and nuns to be taken from the religious establishments which he had just sacked, and forced them to advance before his troops upon the castle, with the ladders in their hands, to plant them against the walls,iand to summon it to surrender. The governor, however, though amazed and horror-stricken at thit sight, answered that " his deeds were not his own, but Heaven's, and that those unfortunate people who had been put forward with the ladders, must bow to the destiny which made them martyrs in the causb of God." Upon this reply, Morgan ordered the monks and nuns to plant the ladders against the walls, and pricking them to the task with the swords of his men, he advanced under their cover to a new assault. At this heart-rending crisis, tears and. lamentations went up from every side. Thie women in the castle wrung their hands; the monks and nuns who bore the ladders, appealed in the name ofthe Holy Virgin to the governor to abstain from' sacrificing them, and on the top of many a house might be seen kneeling devotees, praying to Heaven for that succor which seemed to be beyond the powers of earth. But the governor was a true soldier as Well as a devout chris- tian, and crossing himself solemnly, he gave the signal which discharged his culverins into the bosoms of his own devoted people. Then over the bodies of the murdered nuns did the pirates tramp to the assault. and amid mingled prayers and execrations, shrieks of agony, and cries for mercy, dashed up the ladders with fire-balls and jars of powder in their hands, looking in their smeared faces and wild attire more like an irruption of the damned than any thing of earth. These superhuman efforts succeeded, and foot by foot the bloody Buccaneers hewed their way along the parapet of the castle, until the last handful of its heroic defenders were driven to a corner where they could retreat no further. This handful was inspired by the veteran governor himself, who, resolute to the last, furnished a death to every miscreant who came within the circle of his sword. But unfortunately for his valor, a superior fortune was about to oppose itself to his. Morgan himself had asspmed the extinction of this remnant of resist- ance, and steadily crowded the desperate Spaniards to their last stand- ing point. Overcome, however, at the noble conduct of the Spanish leader, his wolfish nature, which rejected all the throes of pity, was touched with admiration at his courage,-and with his own mouth he repeatedly called upon him to surrender and. be saved. "I will have ,      ,             /,     16         MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER no quarter Il" cried the Spaniard; "I will die like a soldier, and be I content if I can but take two more lives in exchange for this one you are about to take from me!"Moigan at this pressed forward afresh, i but-still ordered his men to take the old cavalier alive. Unfortunately, however, this was not possible, and to subdue his followers without further cost, it was finally found necessary by the pirates to hack him down. What heightened the pathos of this piteous scene, was the figures of the wife and daughter of the old hero, flinging themselves at times before him, and begging him for their sake, as well as for his own, to accept of quarter. After the fall of their commander, the resistance of the Spaniards ended, and the pirates were masters of the city. Night had then closed in, and being weary and half famished, the conquerors locked the male and female prisoners apart, after which they gave themselves up to a boisterous repast. The wassail being over, they went to the place where the women were confined, and each selecting for himself, put the last and worst wrong upon those unfortunate beings whom they already had so much abused. Of those of them who were fair enough to be desirable, none perhaps escaped, but the datughter and wife of the Commander. TheSe two, Morgan himself protected for the con- duct of their dead protector, and sent them. by an escort two leagues upon their way to Panama. Riot and license of all sorts followed this conquest for several days, and drunken ruffians might be seen at all hours staggering through the streets of Porto Bello in a filthy state of personal neglect, with their arms about the persons of some delicate damsel or high-bred matron, whose manners and whose beauty would have graced a court. Several of the pirates were slain in these latter outrages by indignant women who chose rather to perish than to submit to further shame, while others of the wretches lost their lives in duels of dispute, as to possession of some beauteous captive. So great was the disorganiza- tion and looseness of the pirate band through these debaucheries, that after the lapse of some days, fifty resolute men might have entered the city and put them all to the sword. Aroused at length by this state of affairs, and stimulated by two or three cases of irsolence from his men, Morgan recalled his band to a sense of discipline, and reminded them that it was time to bring their stay to a conclusion. He had, however, some difficulty to restore them to sobriety and duty, but news coming over the mountains that the Governor of Panama was getting up a heavy force to cross the isthmus and dislodge them, they conformed to discipline at once. When the pirate chieftain received his information of the intended advance of the Panama troops, he at once made a demand upon the principal citizens of Porto, Bello whom he had locked up in the castle, for the treasures which they had hidden; and in the prosecution of the demand, put many of them to the torture. By this means he obtained large sums of money and articles of value, which, with the pillage of the churches, he caused to be conveyed aboard his ships Finally he demanded a ransom of one hundred thousand pieceb of eight, or half doubloons, fodr the lives of inhabitants as well as tv   MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER.         17 redeem the city from being burned and its castles blown in the air. The inhabitants replied to this exaction that they had no means left, whereupon Morgan directed them to send two of the principal citizens to the Governor of Panama to collect it from their friends in that quarter. This demand only inspired the governor with new rage at their audacity, and having his force in marching order he proceeded hastily forward to secure the pirates before they should retreat. At the news of this movement Morgan, instead of retiring, suddenly adopted the resolution to give him battle, and hurrying towards him by a forced march, posted himself in a narrow pass where with an hundred men he met and repulsed the advanced guard with consider- able loss. The governor was thus forced to retire and leave the people of Porto Bello to their fate; and Morgan, returning to that city, suc- ceeded in extorting the ransom he had demanded. The conquest of Porto Bello and its warlike people by such a hand. ful of men as Morgan had under his command, exited such amaze- ment in .the mind of the governor of Panama, that before the pirate sailed, that dignitary sent a special message to Morgan, desiring to see some of the arms with which he had taken so strong a city. Morgan thereupon took a pistol from his belt, and despatched it back with the words, that "he desired him to keep that small pattern of his army for a twelvemonth, when he would pay him a visit in his own city, and reclaim it." Having sent this saucy threat, he victualed his fleet at the expense of the town, put the best guns of the castle on board his ships, and set sail for Cuba with a booty of 250,000 pieces of eight, or two millions of dollars, and an immense amount of valua- able merchandize, in the way of linen, silks, and plate. This was something better and something worse than the pillage of Principe. CHAPTER    IV. The Pirate Chief receives a presentfroto the English Government-Perfidy to the French Ship-The descent on Afaracaibo and Gibraltar-Atroci- ties on the inhabitants-Great engagement between fMorgan and th Spanish Fleet.  THE conquest of Porto Bello made Morgan'so famous, and his great wealth and power so "respectable" in the eyes of the English government, that the Gbvernor of Jamaica, notwithstanding his atro- cities upon the Spaniards, received him with open arms, and contri- buted to his pirate squadron a fine thirty-six gun frigate, then recently from the colonies at New England. This splendid present enlarged the ideas which Morgan had entertained of his own importance, and he at once upon the gift, covete1 possession of a French frigate of the same size, which lay at Kingston; but which, however, belonged to French pirates, instead of the French government. Morgan proposed to the buccaneers in command of the vessel, that they should join his 2     18         MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER. fleet; but the French being still jealous of his fame, refused. The pi- rate Admiral, however, had set his heart upon this vessel, and having heard that she had recently boarded an English ship at sea, and ex- torted provisions in exchange for some fraudulent bills on Tortuga, instead of good money, he resolved to use the circumstance to excuse his seizure of the vessel. He, therefore, invited the French commander and his leading men, to dine with him at the feast on board his new English ship, and while'the party was filled with wine, he made them all prisoners, and seized their vessel. But this perfidy did not result to his advantage-for at another wassail on board the Eiglish ship not long after, the magazine of the vessel exploded, blowing into the air three hundred and fifty English buccaneers and fifty French pris- oners in the hold. This explosion was charged by Morgan, who, for- tunately for himself, was not on board, to have been perpetrated by the Frenchman in the hold, and he used the accusation to strengthen his right to retain the vessel he had seized. The Frenchman Buccaneer applied to the Governor of Jamaica; but he and his men were thrown into prison, and the ship confiscated to the English, government. Morgan was now eager for a new enterprise, and his great fame having drawn pirates of all countries to him in such numbers as to make their maintenance in idleness too. onerous, he decided to set out for the conquest of Maracaibo, a fine city which lav at the bottom of the Gulf of Venezuela, on the Spanish main. He, therefore, col- lected his forces together, and in eight days after the explosion, set sail for the island of Savona, as a rendezvous. Before going, how- ever, he did not give himself any trouble to have the dead bodies pf his men picked from the ocean for decent burial; but contented him- self with ordering that such as were found floating on the surface, should be stripped of their clothes and jewels, and then left to the monsters of the sea. The force with which Morgan sailed to the conquest of Maracaibo, was in all, fifteen vessels, and but nine hundred and sixty men. The largest vessel was commandet by himself in person, and was of but fourteen guns. With this fleet diminished to eight vessels, and re- duced to five hundred men, by reason of a storm which separated them, did Morgan find himself after the lapse of several weeks, at the mouth of the Gulf of Wnezuela, ready for his daring enterprise. Maracaibo is approached through a spacious bay that lets in on the South American coast, from the Gulf of Mexico, which bay is called the Gulf of Venezuela. At the bottom of this bay is a narrow pass or strait, that lets out into a second and equally large bay, which is called the Lake of Maracaibo. The city of Maracaibo itself, is situated on the narrow pass or neck between these two bays, and within the inner bay about one hundred and twenty miles from Maracaibo, was situated another large town named Gibraltar. The entrance to Maracaibo, from the Gulf of Mexico, is perplexed and difficult; the channel is narrow, and on either side of it is situated two islands named Las Vi- gilas and La Palerma, which, at the time we speak of, were strongly fortified. Morgan arrived off the entraiice of the Gulf of Venezuela, in the   MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER.  middle of the day, but laid off and on till nightfall, so that he mighi pas Vigilas without giving alarm. He did not suceed in reaching it however, till morn, when the Spaniards opened their guns on him, and he was obliged to storm the island sword in hand. The Spaniards, mnatch, which in fifteen minutes more would have exploded the ma a- zinc. By accident, this was discovered, and the large stores of powier which were to have blowrn the pirates into death, wcre transferred to their ships, to turn their danger in another quarter. The pirates then continued their course to Marqcaibo; but the water being so low at one place, that they could not pass, they were forced to debark in boats, and sail with their side-arms and some small brass pieces only, fior the conquest of the town. It turned out, however, that the' fugi- tives from Las Vigilas had communicated their own panic to the city, and all the inhabitants, save-some few miserable people who had nothingr to lose, had abandoned tIhe place, some takingt the road to Gibraltar, and some to Merida, still harther in the. rear. As soon as they entered the Iown, the pirates searched every corner, to see if they could discover if the fugitives had hid their jewels be- fore their flight, and also to ascertain if any of the wealthy or influen- tial inhabitants remained concealed. Finding nothing however, and the town proving to be quite deserted, the whole buccaneer force left the ships, and each mess choosing for itself; located in the fin4st dwellings of the place. On the following day, Morgan sent out a scouting party. of one hundred of his best men, to range the adjacent country for fugitive citizens. This partyreturned on the morning with thirty prisoners and fifty mule loads of valuable goods. Ther.- rates put these persons to the raclk, to make them confess where the rest of the inhabitants of the town were, and whether they had more valuables concealed. Some of' the tortures exceeded all previous in- ve'ntions of barbaritpy. To use the language of an old volume dated "London, 1789," and entitled "History of the Buccaneers" "one mode of torture was to stretch their limbs with cords and then beat them with sticks and!other instruments. Others of the unfortunates hatdl burning matches placed betwixt their fingers, and were thus burnt alive. Others had slender cords or matches twisted about their heads, till their eyes burnt out." Those who would not confess, or who had nothing to declare, died under the hands of these miscreants. These tortures continued for three whole weeks, during which time the op- pressors sent out parties daily for more victims to rack and rob. Havinr by tithese means got into his hands about one hundred of the first families, and considerable plunder, Morgan determined to pene- trate in the Lake of Maracaibo to Gibraltar, as the monster L'Olonais had done before him. Putting his pi'isoners on board his fleet there- fore, t hat they might not male mischief in his rear, he set out with' the intention of hazarding a general battle, and sent a deputation of prisoners in advance, to apprise the inhabitants of his intentions, and to command themn to surrender. But they rejected his clemency, ahd relying on their courage, received him with their great guns, somen of     20        MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER. which were served by the maidens, whose sufferings in case of defeat, were sure to be the heaviest. In the face of this resolute resistance, the pirate chieftain, and his infernal cohorts landed, and taking a sud- den detour through the woods, arrived at an undefended quarter be- fore the inhabitants could get their guns anew in battery. The result was a victory on their part; but it was a victory as fruitless as the first-for the inhabitants, apprehensive of the worst, had all their riches portably arranged, and after spiking the guns, had fled with them be- fore the pirates could discover, by reason of the fast approaching night, what direction they had taken.  On the next morning, they found but a single old man in town, who being a natural simpleton, knew not his danger. Taking him for some rich person in disguise, the savage wretches put him to the rack, whereupon the poor old creature confessed according to their inqui- ries, and told them if they would release him from his pain, he would show them all his riches. He then innocently took them to his mis- erable hut, and pointing out his clumsy dishes and wooden ware, told them there were his treasures and' his ransom. Looking upon this only as a subterfuge, the pirates then asked him his name, upon which the old fellow drawing himself up with a mock dignity, answered that he was no less a person than Don Sebastian Sancherz, brother to the Governor of Maracaibo. This was enough for the pirates. They threw a rope around his neck, and dragging him back to the place of torture, put huge weights to his feet and neck, and hoisted him from the ground with cords.- Getting no answer by these means, they next applied burning palm leaves to his cheeks, and finally burnt him alive. They next captured a peasant and his daughters, the first of whom promised to show them where the inhabitants were hid; but, suspecting his faith, they hanged him to a tree, and gave the girls to the company which had captured them, to be raffled for amongst them. By-and-by the pirates found a negro slave, who, by promises of gold and revenge, they corrupted to their wishes. Through the treachery of this fellow they captured two hundred and fifty of the richest of the fugitives, and by way of bind- ing the black Judas irrevocably to their cause, they made him cut off a great many of the prisoners' heads, and openly abuse many of the females with the most shameful insolencies. Such of these captives as would not confess, were tortured in a most inhuman manner. "Some," to use the language of our authority again, " had their arms broken be- hind their shoulders; others had their faces and bodies horribly burned, and were then laid within the sight of water, without being able to obtain it; others were hanged upon trees by their most tender parts, until they fell to the ground, and the only mercy which was shown to those thus horribly lacerated, was given by the swords which run them through the body. Some were crucified; some were made to sit with kindled matches between the joints of their fingers and their toes, and others had their feet put to the fire, in which position they were roasted alive." After the masters had thus been treated by these fiends, they practised the same cruelties upon the slaves. One of these at length revealed the secret that a ship and four boats, richly laden    MORGiA, THE BUCCANEER. with the treasures of the two cities, lay-moored at a certain portion of the lake, and -another slave disclosed the whereabouts of the Governor and the women. Upon this information, Morgan set out with two hundred and fifty men to a small island where the Governor had built a temporary fort for his defence. Seeing the approach of the formidable pirate, his determination to give him battle there was changed, and he retired with all who were under his protection to a high hill, of most rugged and difficult ascent, and selected a position to which there was no ac- cess, except by a narrow and almost impassible avenue. Discouraged at this prospect, Morgan was obliged to turn back, and to add to his chagrin, there fell upon him while doing so, a heavy rain, so heavy that it deluged all his ammunition, and so Swelled the stream, in the way of his retreat, that he lost most of his mules, while many of his prisoners perished with them. Twelve days did he remain in this condition, and so great was the distress of his forces, that had not the Governor and his-people been struck to their souls with drea Ofifty of them could have put the whole pirate power to the sword.  'lad to get away from this fatal quarter, Morgan at the*end of the twelfth day re-embarked and sailed back to Gibraltar. Fearing now that he would meet with trouble at Maracaibo, unless he hurried back, he ordered a special ransom from every person left in Gibraltar. In this way he received five thousand pieces of eight, and setting sail again, arrived in four days at Maracaibo, after an absence of five weeks. Nothing had changed in that quarter during his absence, but he had the morti- fication to learn from a sick old man, that three large Spanish men-of- war had arrived at the entry of the lalke awaiting their return, and moreover, that the castle at its mouth, was replenished in the most ample manner, and was put in a formidable posture of defence. Retri- bution seemed now about to remind the miscreants of the massacres which they had committed, and the devout catholics who looked at the spectacle afar off, thanked God for this particular interposition of his vengeance. Morgan was now in a position which demanded the exercise of all his genius. What he had previously done, had only required iron will and downright courage; the powers which he now must call to his aid, and which alone could save him, were lodged in that subtle essence of the intellect which so nearly resembles omnipresence itself. He was not unequal to the effort, and it will be seen that in the exi- gency which circumstances had contrived against him, he outgeneraled fate itself. He first sent forth one of his swiftest boats to reconnoitre, and re- ceived answver by the next day, that all was as had beent represented, that the largest of the Spanish ships was forty guns; the second thirty, and the third twenty-four. Seeing themselves so greatly overmatched and involved, despondency spread itself throughout the demon squa- dron, and all expected to see Morgan, who had never pursed his brows with anything like fear before, yield to a feeling of alarm. But they were disappointed; the danger only inspired him with new courage, and instead of succumbing to the crisis, he was inspired with a fresh    22    9     MORGAN, THE BUCOANERB,  audaqity. As in the case when threatened by the Governor of Pana- ma, he turned his face towards his foes, and furnishing a Spaniard with a boat, sent him to the Spanish Admiral to demand the rtnsom of one hundred thousand pieces of eight, as the alternative to save Maracaibo from flames. Amazed at his hardihood, the Spaniards at first knew not what to reply, but concluding that the resources of the pirate must be greater than they had supposed, they resolved to send an answer, that if he would restore all his prisoners and his plunder, he might pass withcut molestation; if he did not, they would put him and every magi con- nected with him to the sword. This reply was dated, "On board the royal ship Magdalena, the 24th day of April, 1669, and signed Don Alonzo Campo y Espinosa." The pirates watched Morgan closely as he read this despatch; seeing which, the acute comimander burst into a contemptuous laugh as he finished the perusal of the paper, and with a jocular expression sum- moned lcouncil in the market place. There the laugh proved its effect,. fT when he read the despatch aloud, and asked whether they would'fight for their deliverance, or buy it with the loss of all they had won, a universal shout went up in favor of the first alternative. Pleased with their confidence and Spirit, Morgan then commenced preparations for the struggle. He made a fire-ship; filled her decks with logs of wood dressed up like men, and in the port-holes placed the little drums used by the negroes of the country, as counterfeit can- non. Under each of these false pieces was placed several pounds of powder, while the ship was lined throughout with all sorts of pitchy substances. With this vessel sailing ahead, the boats with the women, merchandize and other plunder in the rear, the pirates-sailed forward to the assault. When the fire-ship was near enough to the vessel of the Spanish Admiral to receive her guns, the persons in command lighted the pitchy substances on board, and dropped from her in a boat by the st ern, leaving her to go down by herself with all her sails set, on her errand of destruction. Too late, alas, her character was discovered, and before the Spanish Admiral could throw/off the grap- plings he was so eager to embrace, his stays and shrouds had caught, and he was soon enveloped in a hopeless flame. Struck with panic at this spectacle, the second ship made for the castle, but was stranded on the bar in its laste; while the third was taken by-the pirates, and made the flag-ship of the Admiral of the Buccaneers. Morgan then landed and attempted to take the castle, but failing in this, he dared not attempt to pass it with his ships, but was obliged to return to Maracaibo to await a better opportunity to escape. It was at this time he learned from one of his prisoners that the fleet he had de- stroyed, was one that had been specially sent out by the King of Spain to cruise against and destroy the pirates who had takenthe city of Porto Bello. Master of Maracaibo, though not of the passage of the sea, Morgan determined to make the most of his position, and demanded from the inhabitants the sum of thirty thousand pieces of eight, and five hun- dred beeves. This demand was compromised down to twenty thou-   MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER.         2S sand pieces of eight and the beeves, and duly paid. Morgan, however, did not at once fulfil his part of the condition by delivering up his prisoners, but retained them to secure his passage past the castle in the harbor with his ships. Hie forced the captives to make this re- quest upon the commander of the castle, but the Spanish commander refused, and replied to them, that if they had been as loyal to their kin, mn preventing the pirates from entering, as he should in their going out, they would deserve better of their country. Upon this Morgan replied that if Don Alonzo would not let him pass he would manage to get along without him, so he divided his booty among his followers as men settle up their affairs before death, in order that whichever should escape, should have their sharq in their own bottom. During this time the beeves were being killed and salted, and being at last all ready, he prepared to secure his egress to the sea by means of a stratagem. The day before the night he wished to go, he embarked all his men in boats, and drawing towards the island on which the cashe was situated, debarked them on the shore and hid them in the bushes. They then crawled back to the boats so thai they could not be seen from. the castle, and stowing themselves in their bottoms were rowed back from whence they had started, leaving the impression that they were left upon the island. Several expeditions of this kind were sent to and fro until the Spaniards thought that the whole pirate force was landed with the intention of attacking the castle in the night. They thereupon turned all their heavy guns from the sea side, so that they would bear landward in the direction of the anticipated buccaneer attack. Everything answering his calculations, and night being come, Morgan put all his men aboard his ship, and without spreading his sails, dropped down the bay by the tide, which conveyed him gently near the castle. Being at length come over against it, they suddenly set their sails and bore away. The Spaniards perceived their mistake too late, and before they could get back their heavy guns to the sea side, the buccaneers were out of their danger, and returning their cannonade with,his Spanish guns as a sort of parting salute.

It had happene, that when they saw themselves separated from their commander, and not knowing whither he was going or where to     S24*     MORGAN, TAB BUCANZER.- follow him, they came together and determined on an exploit on their own responsibility. They therefore elected a temporary admiralin the person of a man named Captain Hansel, who had displayed great courage at the attack on Porto Bello, and under this man they'sailed down upon the city of Commona, near Trinidad. Being but four hundred in number, however, the Spaniards disputed the entrance of the city so bravely against them, that they were forced to retreat to their ships with a loss that rendered it prudent to weigh anchor at once and sail back to Jamaica. Here, as we have stated, they were shortly rejoined by their companions of the Maracaibo expedition, and had the mortification, while contemplating the rich spoil those more fortu- nate adventurers brought with them, to endure their provoking jeers as to what description of gold and jewels they had brought with them from Commona. Morgan had now become too famous to be allowed to remain long in idleness. The numbers of buccaneers that flocked to his fortunate standard from all quarters of the Antilles, continually importuned him for new exploits, and many of his old followers, having soon become involved in debt through gaming and o,ther .vices; were amongst the most eager in this entreaty. Morgan himself did not lack desire, but feeling his greatness, he only paused to be enabled to undertake some- thing that would be worthy of his increased renown. He, therefore, after mature deliberation, and after consultation also with the English governor of Jamaica, under whose secret encouragement all the pirates fought, decided on a new and grand expedition; and in the style of a prince of an earlier age, sent his proclamation throughout the. West Indian seas, notifying all who had ships or men, who wished to buckle with his cause, to rendezvous at a cave on the south side of the Island of Tortuga, by the 24th of October, 1670. \ The pirate chieftain arrived early at the appointed place, and em- ployed himself in giving directions to the recruits as they arrived, where to hunt to procure food, and where to make descents to collect grain. One of these predatory expeditions was to the Rio de la Hacha, where four pirate vessels seized a fine ship ready to sail for Carthagena, loaded with maize, and also wrung from the inhabitants of the country four thousand bushels more. At length all the necessary provisions being collected, and distributed in due proportion among the vessels Captain Morgan took a survey of his squadron. He found by this review, that his fleet consisted of thirty-seven ships, and that the force which was distributed amongst them was two thousand fighting men and seven hundred marines and boys. Iis own ship was a fine vessel of thirty guns, while the majority of the others were vessels of sixteen and eighteen. The heart of the buccaneer swelled with riingled fero- city and pride as he gazed upon the formidable power, and he felt that the foundation of that permanent power, of which he had so often dreamed, was near at hand. The fortunate are usually generous, and under the influence of that rule, as well as for the purpose of inspiring his followers to greater deeds, Morgan raised the entire scale of rewards and compensations for those who should miscarry or become disabled in the enterprise   MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER.          25 over that, of any 'scale before. These stipulations were as fol- lows:-  Of the entire plunder of the expedition, he, the admiral, was to have a one hundredth share for himself. ,After him every captain should draw the shares of eight men for the expenses of his ship, be- sides the share which fell to himself. To the surgeon, besides his pay, sixteen hundred dollars were to be allowed for his chest of medicines; *to every carpenter, above his salary, eight hundred dollars. For the loss of both legs, a man was to receive a compensation of twelve thousand, or fifteen shares; for the loss of both hands, fourteen thou- sand four hundred dollars, or eighteen shares; for a leg or a hand, six thousand dollars; and for the loss of an eye, eight hundred dollars, or one share. Lastly, if in battle any one should particularly signalize himself either by first entering a castle under attack, or tearing down Spanish and putting up English colors, he was to receive a reward of two hundred and fifty dollars. This contract being signed by the captains of the ships, Morgan appointed a Vice-admiral, and hoisting anchor, the pirate fleet, with its course yet undetermined, set sail for the Cape of Tiburon, on the southwest corner of Hispaniola. Off this cape, however, and central to any of the eligible destinations, Morgan called a council on board the flag-ship, and' presented the names of the three cities of Carthagena on the Spanish Main; Vera Cruz on the Gulf; or Panama on the Pacific, for the aim of the expe- dition. Having heard these proposals, the captains went to their- vessels to consult their crews, and returning to the flag ship again, the choice fell, according to the wishes of the admiral, on PANAMA. As soon as this decision was made, Morgan bore away for the Is- land of St. Catharines, where he had first designed to establish an, in- dependent pirate state; and, as that lay directly in his road, and near also to the Isthmus at an eligible point of passage, he determined to reconquer it, and remain there with his main force, while he despatched a sub-squadron to take possession of the castle at the mouth of the Chagres river, preparatory to his own descent. Thte Spaniard's, after tlhey had recaptured the Island of St. Catharines from the buccaneers, had turned( it into a penal settlement, and sent to it all the higher crilinals of their West Indian possessions. To render it secure from surprise, as well exterior as within, they had fortified it very strongly, and on the small island which adjoined it by a bridge, they built nine separate castles of the most- formidable character. The pirates were therefore received more hotly than they bargained fPr, and, indeed, by reason of a heavy rain which fell upon them shortly after their'debarkation, became reduced to such distress, that they could neither advance upon the smaller island whither all the Spaniards had retired, nor retreat to their ships, now miles behind them. What aggravated their condition very much was, that they had no food, and on the second day when they rose from the wet earth on which they had lodged, they were glad to seize a wretched horse, turned out to die, and divide its raw flesh among them to appease their ravenous appetites. The rain continuing " as if," to use the language of the old chronuicle, " the very heavens had melted into waters," the buccaneers      26         MORGAN, THE BUCCANKER. began to lose all hope, and murmured of returning to their ships. WFinding some sudden remedy necessary at this juncture, Morgan be. thought him of a flag of truce, demanding the governor to surrender. To this the governor replied, that he was aware he had not force" enough to defend the island, and that if Captain Morgan would con- sect to adopt a stratagem of war, and make a false attack by-way of saving his (the governor's) honor, as a soldier, he would accede to his summons of surrender. Morgan, pleasea with the governor's pride, at once consented, and in the night he drew his fleet up to the principal castle, and there commenced at once a furious cannonade of blank cartridges, which resulted of course in a formal surrender of the place. The conquqst of St. Catharines being thus accomplished, Morgan despatched four of his best ships, with as many hundred men, for the conquest of Chagres, preparatory to his descent upon the Isthmus, and while they were gone, devoted himself to despoiling the castles he had taken of their brass guns and military stores, and to conveying them aboard his ships. In this way he obtained thirty thousand pounds of powder and abundance of muskets, after securing which, he blew up the castles, excepting San Jerome, which had contained thern. The person whom Captain Morgan appointed Vice-admiral for the descent upon Chagres, was named Captain Brodley. He owed the honor of the high selection not only to his great reputation for courage and command, but to the fact that he had been a co-lieutenant with Morgan, when under Mansvelt they both had ranged up and down those seas. His name was famous therefore among the buccaneers as well as a word of terror to the Spaniards. In three days after leaving St. Catharines, Captain Brodley arrived in sight of Chagres, and its castle, then named St. Lawrence. "This castle," says one of the old contemporary histories from which we write, "is built on a ligh mountain at the entrance of the Chagres river, antd is surrounded by strong palisades, the interstices between which were thickly filled, with earth, so as to form an outside wall of wood and clay, serving to protect the men as well as stone or brick. The top of this mountain is, in a manner, divided into two parts, be- tween which parts is a ditch thirty feet deep. The castle hath but one entry, and that entry is by a drawhridge over this ditch. To the land it has four bastions, and to the sea it has two more. The south part is totally inaccessible through the cragginess of the mountain. The north is surrounded by the river, which is here quite broad. At the foot of the castle, or rather mountain, is a strong frt, with eight great guns commanding the entry of the river. Not much lower are two other batteries, each of six pieces, to defend likewise, the mouth of the river. At one side of the castle are two great storehouses of all sorts of warlike ammunition and merchandise, brought thither from the inland country for transportation. Near these houses is a high pair of stairs, hewn out of the rock, to mount to the top of the castle. On the west is the port, which is a small one, having not above seven or eight fathoms of water, but being fit for small vessels, and having good anchorage Be- sides, before the castle, at the entry of the river, is a great rock, scarce- ly to be descried but at low tides."    MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER.         27 These-were the natural difficulties which Captain Brodley and his four hundred buccaneers were obliged to face, while in addition to their calculations of resistance, there were in the castle thus protected, an 'extra number of defenders, who had been despatched to its support by the Governor of Panama. His excellency had heard three weeks before, by'means of a vessel from Carthagena, that the pirates under Morgan had set sail from Hispaniola, with the most formidable fleet of freebooters ever set afloat, and a deserter from the buccaneers at the Rio de la lacha, had informed him that its ultimate destination was to the empire city of the Western Ocean. Thus early put upon his guard, the Governor made a hasty muster of his forces, and as a pre- liminary caution, sent a reinforcement to the castle of Chagres of two hundred men. Its ordinary force of one hundred and fifty was thus mbre than doubled, and the difficulties of Brodley were of course in- creased in proportion. Nevertheless, with good heart and accustomed spirit, the pirates landed in a'small cove about a league from the cas- tle, at an early hour in the morning, and advanced through the woods, by a circuitous route to take the castle on the land side. This march, however, proved to be much more difficult than they had bar- gained for. The tangled underwood had in many places to be cut through with their swords, and the unctuous mire and alternate rain clung to their tracks, and weighed their heavy footsteps with fatigue. It was two o'clock before they emerged from covert, and then they found themselves subject to the rays of a burning sun, and exposed to all the severity of the castle's fire. But they dared not retire, and un- der all this disadvantage, with a smaller number of men than the de- fenders of the castle, worn with their previous exertions, and the mol- ten atmosphere above them melting them down with lassitude, these undaunted men resolved to pursue their attack, and advanced to the charge. In one hand they carried their swords-in the other balls of fire, scarcely more flaming than the sun, and thus equipped, with their bodies half naked, because of the heat, did they rush upon the pali- sades.  The Spaniards defended themselves with a spirit equal to the attack which they sustained. They not only felt confident in their own num- bers, but confiding in the great preparations which the Governor of Panama was making for the reception of the main'body of the bucea- rieers to the west, they considered that they were to be the most fortu- nate heroes of a campaign which were to exterminate the bands that had been the curse of Spain for fifty years. As the pirates with curses would discharge their fire balls at them, they would reply in the same temper, " come on, ye English dogs 1 Enemies to God and our king; and let your other companions that are behind, come on too-ye stall not go t9 Panama this bout 1"So vigorous was the defence, that the freebooters, with all their audacity and persistence, were obliged after two hours' effort to retiie, and now rest themselves till night.

All theirefforts to take orburn the palisades, were baffled, how- ever, through hours of effort, and there is but little doubt they would have been obliged to retire, had it not been for an incident of most singular character-an incident, which had it occurred on the side of a good cauise, would have been entitled to bq set down as a special inter- position of Providence in their behalf. One of the pirates was wounded by an arrow in his back, which pierced his body through, whereupon he boldly pulled the weapon out at his breast, and wrapping sonme cotton about the shaft, he put it in his musket and shot it back within the palisades. The cotton ignited by the fire of the discharge, and falling upon some houses thatched with palm, set them in X blaze. Being so much engrossed by the attack, the Spaniards did not no- tice tahis danger until it had extended to three or four buildings, and soon they were struck with consternation, at hearing an explosion which blew up a great portion of the powder that constituted their magazine. The pirates took advantage of this confusion, by increasing the vigor of their assault, and having by reason of the fire, but half the force to contend with that had resisted them at first, they succeeded in setting fire to the palisades. These fires thus lit, were with great difficulty extinguished by the Spaniards-for they had but little wa. ter, and while they were engaged in getting it, the pirates would crawl near the flames and discharge their muskets between the crevices.- Many of the Spaniards were thus killed, and when the nmorning came it was found that in many places the clay had crumbled from between the palisades, and left those within as much exposed to the fire of musketry as had been those outside. The battle was then renewed, and raged till noon, at which time the pirates gained a breach de- fended by the Governor himself. The noble Spaniard made a valor. ous defence, and refusing quarter, like him of Porto Bello, died with his sword out, by a musket ball in his head. Upon this, all resistance ceased, and most of those who were left, ran to the battlements and cast themselves into the sea, choosing rather that chance, than to ask mercy firom those who always wrote theirlenity in blood. The greater number of these people perished, and altogether there were but thirty of the garrison who fell into the pirates' hands. From these prisoners Brodley ascertained how  it was that the Governor of Panarna had come to reinforce the castle, and also learned that the Governor had placed several ambuscades along the river Chagres, to intercept the march of the marauders, while he intended to receive them in the open felds of Panamra, with a  force of three thousand six hundred stout fighting men. Upon reviewing his condition after the battle, Brodley found that the conquest of Chngres had cost him unusually dear-for in, addition to the fatigue and labor he and his force had undergone, fatigue that was equal to all that had been endured in the taking of St. Catharine's he had lost in killed and wounded, one hundred and seventy men. A great aim, however, had been accomplished-the  road was open to- wards Panama, and Brodley felt as he dumped hIis own dead clansind overboard with the stark Spaniards, that it was better to be thus cut   up, than to go back to Morgan with a report that the castle 'could not be taken except at too much loss. The wounded were carried to the church, and in with them, to at- tend upon their wants, were put all the women of the place. The oc- cupation of nursing the sick, was not all however, which these misera- ble females were obliged to undergo;-those whose eyes were wet with the loss of a husband or a brother, were obliged to submit to the em- braces of his murderer, and the very altar was desecrated with deeds ' of shameful license. News of the conquest of Chagres was at once despatched to Morgan, and soon he came bearing down with all his fleet; and so overjoyed was he and his followers at seeing the English flag stream from the castle, that they entered the narrow harbor too suddenly, and. stranded four of their ships, among which was the flag ship of the Admiral.- Morgan and his force were received with great acclamations and the firing of cannon by the buccaneers in possession of the castle; but laving no time to lose in vain parade, he ordered the castle put in re- pair at once, garrisoned it with five hundred men, and leaving his fleet behind him, advianced across the Isthmus to the direction Panama, at the head of twelve hundred men.' A line of ambuscades and three thousand six hundred men awaited him; but we shall see in our next chapter how he made out.  CHAPTER VI.  Passage across the Isthmus-Hardsh2ips of the MJarch--The Feast of Leather Bags--Prospect of Panama-- ig2ht before its cwalls., MORNING broke over the Castle and Fort of Chagres, and all within and without was bustle and preparation. The Btuccaneers were start- ing for the conquest of Panama, the prospect of whose rich plunder caused all the dangers and difficulties of an unknown and unexplored wilderness to sink into insignificance, and inspired the breasts of Mor- gan and his followers with that courage and perseverance, which, in great enterprises, generally leads to success. All being in readiness, Morgan, having with him twelve .hundred men, thirty-two canoes for the transportation of his troops, and five large boats laden with artil- lery, commenced his-march across the Isthmus to Panama. The first day, only six leagues were accomplished, and he rested wilth his force at Do Los Braces. The very comlnencement would have appalled a less fearless spirit. The river, whose course they fol- lowed, passed through thick and almost impenetrable woods on either side, and through the bosom, as it were, of lofty and precipitous moun- tailns, from which they expected at every moment, to receive the ar- rows of the Indian, or the contents of the Spaniard's arquebus. On they passed, however, and no Spaniards, or Indians appeared in sight, nor gave any covert sign that they -were on the watch for the invaders. On the contrary, all had fled, and carried off with them every thing in  80        MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER. the shape of provision, leaving their trace behind them bare and deso- late. Hunger was the only enemy which now stared the bold Buccan- eers in the face. Morgan, relying on meeting his enemies, and on' conquering and plundering them as. he went along, had not sufficiently provisioned .his army, and therefore, at the close of the firs; day, inde- pendent of the fatigue, there was such a scarcity of food, that the greater part of the men were obliged to &o without any sustenance., On the evening of the second day, they reached, in like manner, Cruz de Juan Gallego. Here, the river being so dry for want of rain and being also obstructed with fallen trees, Morgan was obliged to leave his large boats with one hundred and sixty men to guard them, while he continued his progress with-the canoes. The third night broughtt the Buccanecrs to Cedro Bueno. This day s advance had been attended with still greater hardships, and when the night came down upon them, in the darkness and gloom of the boundless wilderness they were still without refreshment or food. e WBeak, weary, and dispirited, they laid down to rest, to draw their only consolation from the visions of sleep, in which the plenty and revelry (f the halls of Parnama rose in bright colors before their imaginationl. The fourtl day the march was continued in two divisions, one party in the canoes by water, the other on land, both being led by guides. Hitherto, they had seen neither Spaniard nor Indian. The Buccaneers were eager to meet them, especially as they thought that if they could surprise them in ambuscade, they would possibly get some provisions. About noon, they arrived at a post called Torna Cavallos. Here was heard the animating cry of the guide that an ambuscade had been dis- covered. The joy produced by the intelligence was unbounded, and the Buccaneers, with the taste of a plentiful repast already on their tongues, rushed forward like so many ravenous wolves, to pounce upon their prey. But they were doomed to disappointment. Judging by the appearance of the place, about five hundred Spaniards had been there, but all they had left behihd, were a few huts they had built, and some leather bags. The former, Morgan and his men with rage lev- elled to the ground, and then fell to feasting on the latter, to such dire necessity had the gnawings of hunger driven them. They cut the bags into -pieces, then dipping them into water, beat them between two stones, until they were tender, when,*having scraped off the hair, they broiled and eat them. The fifth day they came to Barbacoa. They founl at this place traces of the Spaniards, but, as before, everything in the shape of food or plunder had been removed, with the exception of a few sacks of wheat and meal, and two jars of wine, which they' had the good for- tune to discover in a cave or grotto. These Morgan caused to be dis- tributed among tie weakest of his party, and then part of the force occupying the boats, and part breaking their way through on the land, the toilsome combined march and sail again commetced. Through the dark woods which rose on either side of the river, through the yield- ing morass, and up the 'ocky steeps, did these men of rapine and blood, led on by a master spirit, pursue their way with unfaltering   "ORGAN, THE BJCCANEtR. ,urage, although starvation was preying on their vitas, fatigue palsy- ,' s a d more ,ooky pth                next Le' their imbs, tnd they knew not one moment what enemythe next ight start from the ildenes arou d them, to impede their progess Ln night cme, an4 again they closed their eyTes in epit ud fainting, to draw their consolation from dreams.

In these last, Morgan and his men found some fifteen or six- teen jars ofo Peru wine, and sack of bread. Both were soon con- r sumed, and immediately afterwards most of the men were taken with a violent sickness. The whole camp was in consternation, under the impression that the wine had been poisoned, but it proved to be only the combined effect of their wesak conditin, the things whih they had previously eaten, d this indugence The     82        MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER. village of Cruz being the point, beyond which canoes cannot go, and from which the journey to Panama is made entirely by land, Captain Morgan was obliged here to disembark all his force. He sent, there- fore, for fear of surprise, all his canoes back to the place where on the second day of his march he had left his large boats, reserving but one, which would be necessary in case he wished to convey intelligence. The Spaniards and Iridians, although they had fled from the place, still hovered in the neighborhood, and Morgan gave orders that none of his men should stray out from the town, for fear of their being attacked and taken. A small party, however, in their eagerness to make a foray, suffered for their temerity, by being charged upon by a body of Indians and Spaniards with such violet*, that before they could gain the refuge of their companions, one of their number was taken prisoner. On the eighth morning, the march was renewed. The path was now extremely narrow, and the danger of ambuscades imminent. Morgan therefore sent two hundred men before his main body, with the dou- ble purpose of detecting these ambuscades, and exploring the road to Panama. Now, for the first time, an enemy appeared to dispute the passage of the freebooter's army across the Isthmus. As they neared a place called Quabrada Obscuia, a shower of arrows from a high rocky moun- tain greeted them with serious effect, and it was in vain that they sought to discover the hands from which it came. Bearing it, there- fore, as well as they could, they marched frward until they entered a wood, where they perceived one body of Indians flying before them, while another stood ready to give them battle. The contest was not long-the superior force and skill of Morgan and his men soon over- came the untutored children of the forest, Who, although they fought bravely for their homes and soil, fought in vain. * The Indian chief, with his companions cut to pieces around him, fell himself to the' ground covered with wounds, and asking no quarter, and was shot while endeavoring in the agonies of death to pluck a second javelin from his belt to strike at one of his enemies. Those of the Indians who .were not killed, escaped by flight, their nimblenessof foot baffling all efforts to capture them. Eight of Morgan's army were killed, and  ten wounded. Having dressed the wounds of their comrades as well as they were able, they again moved on, and soon found themselves in a broad plain covered with fertile meadows. As they progressed further, a mountain arose in their path, the top of which was crowded with Indians. As they approached, the Indians fled, mocking them in their flight with their usual cry-"To the plain, to the plain, ye English dogs 1"As before, all efforts to catch them were useless. Opposite to the mountain where the Indians and Spaniards ha4 posted themselves, there was another of equally steep ascent, while a thick wood lay between. Captain Morgan took possession of this mountain, and sent a body of men to search the wood, thinking, from the advantages of the place, that the Spaniards had doubtless placed an ambuscade there; but the passage was free for him; no Spaniards or Indians could be found, although both had descended from the   XOiANSN, TH iCOAC1MEEt.        8 mountain where they were posted when the search conmenced, as id to give battle. With the rain pouring down on them in torrents, and, sheltered only by a few shepherd's huts, Captain Morgan and his bue-: daneers passed the eighth night of their adventurous enterprise, 'On the morning of the ninth, all were up betimes and on their way, while yet the dew was bright upon the grass, and before thetin with itascorching rays had dissipated the fresh and bracing air. They had not been on their march more than two hours, when they discovered that they were watched by a body of about twenty Spaniards, who{ at intervals, would suddenly appear from behind the rocks, or issue out of some cave and as suddenly disappear. Morgan despatched a party afer them, but the superior knowledge of the country possessed by the Spaniards, defeated entirely all pursuit. And now well nigh spent with hunger and fatigue, the buccaneers toiled their way at noon up the steep ascent of a mountain, until they reached its summit, when in a moment all their hardships were forgotten in the scene which spread itself before them. There, stretching far away, with its blue waters, laid the Pacific Ocean, while out from the Bay of Panama, vessels and boats were seen sailing towards the green islands which dotted its sur- face. The goal was at hand, the end of their labors was in-view, and with a shout of exultation, they rushed madly down the sides of the mountain to the vale below. As if in prelude to the booty in store for. them at Panama, they found in this vale cows, horses, and bulls, feed- ing in numbers on the rich pastures. To kill and flay was but the work of a moment. Fires were kindled, but the impatience of hunger caused the tempting morsels to be snatched from the coals while yet raw, and devoured with ferocity; while their haggard faces, the blood streaming from their mouths, and their eyes starting from their sockets in the greediness of their appetites, gave to this feast of these marauders the appearance of one of so many painted savages. Filled now to repletion, and animated by their hopes, Morgan gave the order for the continuance of the march. As the shades of evening closed in upon them, they saw relieved against the blue sky the, tallest spre of the city of Panama, and their satisfaction was complete. Their trumpets were sounded, their drums were beaten, and their long loud shout irent the air and was borne by the evening breeze into the very heart of the city. The governor and inhabitants heard the sound. They knew full well from whence it proceeded, for the fame of Mor,. gan and his band had reached them long: before ;. but they had trusted too much to the natural defences of their position, and had thought it, impossible that even the bold buccaneer, who had made all the opposite: coast ring with terroi of his exploits, would have dared to teinpt the dangers and difficulties of a passage across the Isthmus, through fast- nesses where he was at any time liable to be cut to pieces. Little, however, did they know the character of him against whose advance they reposed in such careless security.

The/gur from the city were firing upon them during the whole night, 'but, they slept on, unconcerned and unharmed.

'  Thus slept the buccaneers before the city of Panama, while their daring and lawless leader himself waited with impatience for :the thorn, 'ag light, that he might commence the work of blood and death, which would lead him and his band to gold and plunder.

X PANAMA, before which, in our last chapter, we left the buccaneers encamped and sleeping on the grass, was indeed a city to tempt the avaricious and unscrupulous grasp of Morgan and his followers, and at the same time, to bind to it. in an extraordinary degree, the affec, tion of its citizens. Situated on a rocky peninsula, it jutted out on the: one hand into a broad bay, and commandled an extensive prospect of the Pacific Ocean, while on the other hand, on the land side, the mostA fertile plantations and pleasant gardens approached to its very walls, Is waters abounded in tish of every kind, from which fact indeed the dity-takes its name. The city proper consisted of about seven thou^- sand houses, built mostly of cedar wood, eight monasteries and two churches, richly adorned with altaropieces and paintings, and amply supplied with gold and silver plate and precious stones. Two thou; sand of the houses, inhabited by rich merchants, were very magnifi-. cent buildings, and there was also a hospital, which was :not deficient is architectural splendor. In- this city, also, were the stables belonging to the King of Spain, in which a large number of horses and mules were continually kept, to transport the, royal plate, and for other pur pose connected with -the service of the crown. Such was the place before which the buccaneers slept on the night of the ninth day of: thijrt march from Chagres, and such the place, which- to plunder and- rgei they waited only for the morning's liglt.  Meanwhile, all within Panama, was a scene of commotion.; Citi- zens were hurrying to and fro, whispering to each other with blanched, behss andquivering lips"They have come, Motgan and his Eglish   MORGAN, T  .lE BUCCIANEERCR  os -ar6 'at' our gates" Priests were in their churches, aid nnna4* leir convents busily engaged in stripping their altars of ;thEjri j rnamentg, gathering together the gold and silver plate, and:n - 'ning away io bury the treasures in wel!, or hide them irtatoir - ret places, while in every street was lteard the din of arms, - an&dle 'amp of soldiers, as the whole military 'force was musteredtoget , i defend the city.                 f  Full well did the Governor and inhabitants know the fearfulienemy ith whom they had to deal.

No sooner did the eyes of the buccaneer aehif fall- on her, as she stood in her loveliness in his presence, than he de- terained to sacrifice her to 'his passions. Althoughs a pirate4an041 fiend, Morgan could chlange. his savage nature into one of softmio, when- it suited his purposes, and he did so now. He gave-- heladyjr charge toea negro woman, assigned her an apartrent by herself, 4t which he paid her, she at length became almost, impressed with tre elief -that the Buccaneers were not the abandoned men 'she had be-e lieed tem tobe. She had been told that theywer heretis tht taey neither, believed in God or Christ; but hearing them swear o many times by God' and Christ, she began tothink otherswise.

Morgan was;'foiledi  by-her virtue, and'he took his revenge by ordering her to be stripped' ofther apparel, and imprisoned in a dark and noisome dungeon d When his comrades remonstrated with him on this treatment-lfor eteys they, by o:),oe strange contradiction in their natures, were shoeked by this instance of his barbarity--he gave as 'a reson, that slie: orresponded-with the Spaniards'tp his prejudice, and had abuse4 Ms kindness. -The buccaneers' had now been revelling and collecting plunder in: atd around Panama for three weeks, when Morgan, having received intelligence from Chagres, that his-followers at that place had 'beei" silca .his departure, equally successful with him in new schemes of pifacy, prepared to rejoin them. He accordingly gave orders for miles to :be procured to convey the spoil to the river at Cruces, where his caetoes lay, and made other necessary arrangemenits for his retxrn. At this moment, news came to his ears, that a conspiracy was formed against him. It was -said that a large number of the bucca- nets Were on the point of leaving :him-of taking a ship then in the. port, and going on a piratical expedition of their own' in the South SeaA. For this purpose they had collected a large quantity of pro- visions, ammunition, and guns, and secreted them in private places, with the further design of fortifying themselves on some island, to' which in timesof danger, they could retire for refuge. Morgan acted' ont this occasion with the promptness and boldness peculiar to him. He found the ship designed foi the enterprise, and ordered her main- mixst to be cut down and' burnt, together with those of all the others in the port. He then commanded all the artillery of the town to be nailed up, and thus he nipped the conspiracy in the bud. Receiving further intelligence, that the Governor of Panama, who had escaped' into the country at the taking of the city, was now preparing ambus- cades for' him on his' return, Morgan sent out his scouts to discover the truth Of the rumor. Word was brought back that the governor had intended to do so, but that the-men whom he had employed would not, when it came to the point, undertake the task, so great was the tertor inspired by the Buccaneer Chief and his band. Everything being in readiness, Morgan, with one hundred and seventy five mules laden with silver, gold, and other valuable articles, the proceeds of his plunder, and accompanied by six hundred prisoners, left Panama, and turned his face towards Chagres.   oa10QA, THE BUCALEt m. - CHAPTER VIII.        '      , Tkle Buccaneerson thei return to Clhagres-Mforgan and t7he i4y-.earcj qef the persons of the Buccaneers for concealed plunder Division of the spoil and the abandonment of his companions by Morgan -End of Mr- gan's career.  ou:IN ourlast chapter, we left Morgan and his marauding army departi ing from Panama,. with a long train of six hundred prisoners, and one. hundred and seventy-five mules laden with gold, silver, and other val- uable booty. First in order marched one party of Buccaneers, then in the middle came the booty and the prisoners, while the rest of the- Buccaneeis brought up the rear. The heroic lady, who, had so nobly resisted the brutal Morgan,- was guarded between two of the fiercest, of. his band. Thus passed the pirate crew from the place where once' stood the fair city of Panama, which their chief had laid in ashes, and, which they now left behind them a,blackened ruin, to mark, as with. a plague-spot, the traces of their destroying footsteps. :The Buccaneer host, as it moved forward, presented a picture, and sent forth a sound, the sight and hearing of which were enough to have caused angels to weep and devils to laugh-rank after rank of desper- ate marauders, marching with exultant tread and countenances in- flamed with wine, and lighted up with fiendish joy-in their midst a' crowd of men, women and children, urged forward at the point of the, sword and bayonet by their merciless masters, while up from the one arose the savage shout and laugh, the curse and imprecation, and from the other the shriek of misery and despair. Such was the triumphal procession of Morgan from this last scene of his plunder. .During the first day's march the prisoners were kept without food or drink, the design of Morgan being to add in every degree to the horror of their situation, in order to make them procure money to.. ransom themselves. At evening, the Buccaneers found themselves in abeautiful plain on the banks of a small river, and here they encamped. Here also occurred a scene that would have moved to pity a less savage heart than that of Morgan. While, with his men, by the camp fires he was feasting and carousing in the midst of abundance, a party of the captive women, famished with hunger, and with their children clinging to them and crying for bread, surrounded him with piercing cries, lamentations and tears, begging him on their knees for food, im- ploring him that he would let them return to Panama with their hus. bands, and that there, although he had left no houses to shelter them, yet they could erect straw huts and live in them until they could re- build the city. Morgan regarded them a moment with brutal ferocity, and said, "I came not here to listen to cries and lamentations, bring money for your ransom and you are free, until then, I'll have you Deateii and starved, and if you bring it not at all, I'll shoot you an;d your husbands ;" then ordering some of his men to drive them off:t their quarters, he turned again to his carouse. In the morning the     i       M  ba^ji^,MiGA Bt RUcGOANktiR march was again resumed in like order as before, until they reached the town of Cruces, where Morgan had left his boats. During the progress oftthe Buccaneers thus far, the lady before spoken of, whom Morgan would have made his victim, had suffered every' kind of privation and indignity, except actual violation, at tlhe. hiands df her two brutal guards. This last they had refrained from only through fear of Morgan. They had forced her to walk until her feet were torn and bleeding, and then, when exhausted nature coitd bear no more, they had placed her on the hard and uneven pack of one of the laden mules, where the torture of her situation was ibut in a slight measure relieved. In the meantime they had given her but sparingly of the refuse of their food, and made her the shrinking list- ener'to their obscene jests and songs. On the night of the arrival of the Buccaneers at Cruces, she lay agonized with pain in mind :and- body, on the rough hide of a mule, which they had spread for her on the ground, and was endeavoring to forget her. sorrows in sleep, when a negro came panting and breathless to the camp, and desired to. be conducted to her. He was told, with an oath, to, find her. His eyes wandered over the fierce forms around him, until they rested upon the spot where the lady was reposing, when, rushing to her, he fell at hep feet with a cry of joy. She started up at the well known voice, for it was a faithful slave of her family, and in his hand he grasped tightly a letter. With the frenzy of excited hope she snatched it from him, and there learnt to her dismay, that two monks, whom, a few days be, fore she left Panama, she had sent to certain of her friends for as much money as would ransom her, had accomplished their mission, procured  the money, and-were now actually prisoners with her in the Buccan- eer camp. Frantic with contending feelings of indignation against the betrayers of her trust, and of the hopeless despair which now stared her in the face, she besought her keepers to carry her into the presence of their chief. They did so, and she stood again before the man whose fierce nature she knew but too well, but on whose mercy she was :re solved, with a last despairing effort, to cast herself. The eye of the Buccaneer chief was lighted up with a malignant pleasure as he sur, veyed her, still lovely, even in the traces-of misery on her count. nance, and in the, soiled and tattered garments which covered her per son. "Ah, my scornful lady," he cried, "what would you now with me? You refused my love, how like you rny-revenge? The sentence'was love, ransom, or bitter captivity. Come you now to bring the love or ransom?"The beautiful and heroic woman for a moment wept, for the vision of her home and husband rose before her, and the words of Morgan cut like a knife into her very soul, but brushing the falling drops hastily away, she elevated her form to its full height, and proudly answered: "As for my love, you- had my answer over 'the smoking ruins of my home, death before your pollu- te embrace, but pirate and fiend that you are, I come .to you to make an" appeal to your justice, if there are the smallest remains of such a holy feeling in your steeled and hardened breast. At your bidding, before leaving Panama, I sent two monks, in whom I trusted, to pro- oure my ranson money. They did procure it, but have betrayed my   I i , MRGANs,    C BUOANk At. trist, and are now prisoners in your camp. Confront them here wits me, and give me justice." The' book of human nature is at all tithes ainurious one to read, and'instances are not wanting where, in souls stained with 'the darkest crimes, a chord will sometimes be touched, that brings forth a right response. It was so in the present case. Whether this fearless answer of his capftive, taken in connection with her noble bearing under all the wrongs and injuries which he had heaped upon her, had at length ex- cited Morgan's admiration to the pitch of something like generosity, or whether some recollection of former days, when he himself was free from crime, crossed his seared heart while she was speaking and moved him to pity, cannot be determined. Certain it is, that some- thing-stirred the depths of his soul, for his eye softened its glances as she concluded, and he ordered all the prisoners, who were ecclesiastics, to be brought into his presence. They were soon marshalled before him, when he directed the lady to point out the culprits. One glancd along the cowled array was sufficient for her to recognize, and single out her betrayers. Knowihg that there was no use of subterfuge in a court like that Where Morgan was the judge, the wretches immediately fell on their knees, confessed the deed, and begged for mercy. The excuse which they gave was, that on the morning when they had re- turned to Panama from the mission on which the lady had sent them, they found that two of their brother priests had' just been taken pri- soners, and that they, therefore, sent the money to them, in order that they might ransotn themselves with it; in, the meantime they had also been seized and prevented from seeking other money to replace the suyi which they thus, for the good of the order, had temporarily di- verted from its rirlht use. Morgan's answer to their plea was short and decisive. Pointing to a tree, he told them that if in three days they did not procure double the sum for their own ransom, he would hang them without mercy with their own girdles from its branches; Then ordering his soldiers to return to the lady her former rich ap- parel and provide her with a mule, he informed her that she was free to go where she pleased, and that her slave was at liberty to attend her. The lady bcnt ald kissed the hand of the buccaneer chief; the faithful negro, as if new life had suddenly been given to him, leaped to her side, and placing her on the mule, the departing forms of both were soon lost to the view in the dark shadows of the night. Morgan' followed them with his eyes until he could see them no longer, then roused himself from his reverie, and as if to smother the thought of the generous action which he had just performed, he issued the order, in a voice of thunder, that wtithin three days all his pri- soners should brihg their ransom money, and those who did not would be transported to Jamaica. The three days passed and many of the prisoners, the two monks among the number, were fortunate enough to procure the-money and obtain their freedom. The rest were embarked with the buccaneer army in the boats, and the whole proceeded on their way to Chagres. i When about half the distance to that place, Morgan commanded a general muster of the Buccaneers, and administered a solemn oath to each /     w         MOBGIOANX, THUE BUCDOAINu . that they had concealed nothing about their persons. He was :not however, content with this. Knowing the full value of a pirate's oath, he commanded that every one should be searched. and submitted first himself to the ceremony. The French party of the buccaneers demurred to this unusual precaution, but the English were in the majority, and the search was made. Only one poor fellow had any thing contraband ajout him. His treasure consisted of some fine pearls which he said he had come honestly by, for he had not stolen them; he had dis- covered that there was good pearl fishing in the bay of Panama, and like an honest fisherman, he had made a dive and brought some up, which he now claimed as his own private property. It was not inm- possible that his story might be true, for Panama was at that time. famous for its pearl-fishery; but Morgan, believing that no buccaneer would take the trouble to dive in the water when lhe could make a more profitable one with less danger and trouble on land, struck the pirate pearl-fisher a blow over the head with his pistol, which laid him senseless on the earth, saying as hle did so, "Dive then to h-11, and see if you cannot bring somnething better than sermons on honesty aqd private property." The pearls were thrown into the common stook. The search being over, their progress was irenewed, and the bucca- neers were soon before the castle of Chagres. Their companions, whom they had left there, received them with shouts of welcome. A1l had been prosperous at the castle since their departure, and returning as they did laden with plunder, their coming was hailed with joy. As soon as the excitement consequent on their return had abated, Morgan sent word to Porto Bello, demanding a considerable sum for the ran- som of the castle of Chagres, or-else he would blow it to atoms. Au- swer was returned to him that he might wreak his vengeance as he pleased, for they would not send a farthing. A general dividend was now made of the spoil obtained by the ex- pedition to Panama. Morgan himself, according to a rule of his own, conducted the division, and assigned to each one, as his share, two hundred pieces of eight. Much murmuring from many of the buc- caneers followed. They openly taxed Morgan with a design to cheat them, and told him that he had kept the most valuable jewels to him- self, but Morgan for a time regarded them not. Finding, however, that the murmurings at length grew longer and louder, and being  satisfied with the wealth which he had now collected by his long career of rapine, he resolved to give his companions the slip, and. re- turn to England. With the assistance of some chosen confederates, whom he had suf- fered to share larger than the other buccaneers in the various divisions of booty which he had made, he caused his own treasures, together with the ordnance of the castle, to be carried on board of his own ship, and then demolished the walls and battlements of the castle itself. He cornniitted as many other acts of destruction as time would permit, in order to render the situation of those whom he had left behind as powerless as possible to follow him. All being in readiness, he em- barked stealthily by night, and put immediately to sea, foliowed by only three vessels of the whole neet. These last were manned by the   OR%;A- THe IBU0WC  3BSE         4$ feS;vered;:ssociatls, to whom he had confided the knowledge of ,his lataet--of villiany, and who had assisted him in carrying it out.: ' - Oar history, with reference to Morgan, closes here; He never after- wards appeared in the character-of. a buccaneer chief. On his returA to :England, that country received him with favor, and presented Shim soon after with a substantial mark of regard. England in fact, weni Morgan first fitted out his piratical expedition, furnished him with ships and arms, on purpose that he might harass the Spaniards. Now, coming .home as he did, a robber and murderer of the basest degree, the opened her arms to him, and when a fleet, Inot long afterwards, ,waS sent to the West Indies, Morgan was appointed second in com- maad o:pf the expedition. It seems, however, that in his conduct during that enterprise, he was rather too unscrupulous, even where scruples of no plight bulk were easily swallowed. He was recalled, and retiring to;his native Wales, he built a magnificent mansion, in which he closed his days, to all outward appearance as tranquilly as an honest man.  We can accent for this disgraceful action on the part of England in reference to Morgan, on no'other principle but of that sympathy which wholesale national murder. and plunder, under the name of war, -must ever have with like acts, committed on a smaller scale; by individual hands, under the name of piracy. England should either have driven hin from her shores, as a fiend abhorred, or hung him in gibbets the monment he touched her soil.; But she took him by the hand, led him on, the decks of, her-proud navy, and asked him to kill and plunder anew beneath the sacredness of her flag.

Condition of the Buccaneers after the departure of Morgan.-Their anger ;tand revenge.-They start on separate Expeditions,-Narrative of the Voyage of one of the Parties.--Their visit to the Mosquito Coast.--Ous omrs and manners of the MJosquito Indians.-Departure of the Buccan- eers for Jamaica.  - THE anger of the Buccaneers, on awakening one fine morning, and discovering the absence of their chief, knew no bounds. It is true, they regarded him as a villain, like themselves, and had no great love for him, but the future looked blank when they contemplated, in com- ing enterprises, the absence of that bold and determined spirit, which had ever awed them into subjection, and led theln to success. They rushed in crowds down to the shore, to catch, if possible, a glimpse of the'departing vessels of their chief; but their gaze wandered over the wild :waste of waters until it reached the point where the blue sky kisses the bosdrn of the sea, and yet they saw no trace or sign. Curses and imprecations ndw rent the air, and the storm of blasphemy grew louder. when it was soon discovered that Morgan/ had completely rifled the place of provisions, to furnish his own ships, and had, in addition,      ":        MOaGAN, THE BUCCANEER. left them only a few crippled vessels. In the midst of this outhreak of feeling, a small party of Buccaneers, bound hand and foot; were brought forward among the crowd. They were equipped and ready for sailing, and had been discovered on the shore with a boat filled with some treasureand provision. Their situation was evident-they had designed to go with Morgan, but being too late or through some other cause, had been left behind. Their punishment was summary. Their excited companions rushed upon them, and first cutting their throats with their knives, then blew out their brains with pistols. The Buccaneers now held a council of war, to determine what they should do under their present circumstances. In a few days famine would stare them in the face, and it was, therefore, necessary that their future plans should soon be decided. After some consultation, it was concluded that they should separate and seek their fortunes in distinct parties. As there is here quite an interval of time in the combined expeditions of the Buccaneers, we shall, as a short interlude, follow the steps of one of these separate exploring, parties. The band of Buccaneers with whom our narrative ithow concerned left Chagres in one small vessel, which had grown foul and almost un- fit for sailing. They steered first along the coast of Costa Rica, and soon arrived at the port of Bocca del Tora. This port is surrounded by a number-of small islands, which were inhabited by tribes of Indi- ans called Indian Bravos, because the Spaniards could never subdue them. Here the Buccaneers went on shore to seek for food, but all they obtained was a few crocodiles' eggs, which hunger must have made palatable, although the consumers of the feast have left no ac- count how they tasted. The feast of crocodilep being over, the Buccan- eers again embarked on board of their vessel, and cruised about for some days, first in an eastward, then in a westward direction, living, in the meantime, on the few tortoises which they could catch. They were finally obliged, in order to procure fresh water, to land ,on one of the numerous small islands which stud the shores of the coast, and which are inhabited by the hostile Indian Bravos before mentioned. The Buccaneers were aware that it was rather dangerous, but being used to danger and consumed by thirst, they did not hesitate long. One party, on landing, proceeded to fill the barrels, while another ranged the woods. They had not long been at work, when the Indians made their appearance. The Buccaneers immediately put themselves in an attitude of defence, and fired briskly into their savage neneies. The latter soon fled, leaving two of their companions dead behiid them. The Buccaneers did not pursue, being more anxious to get water than to fight Indians, forn whom they could not expect to gain much booty. In this instance, however, they found gold where they least expected it, for, on examining the two slain Indians, they discovered that one of them wore a golden beard. It was formed by a bunch of gold lianging down his lips by two strings, which were fast- ened there by two holes made for the purpose. This Indian also ap- peared, by his richly, woven girdle and curiously carved weapons of warfare, to have beenone o' their chiefs. The Buccaneers soon shaved his face and disrobed the body. The pirates having procured a supply   MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER.         45 of water, continued their cruise for some days, but without meeting with much success. They fell in, at length, with another cruising party of the Buccan. eers, who had but lately set out from Chagres for Carthagrena, but the wind being contrary in that direction, both parties now agreed to keep company with each other. Thus reinforced, the Buccaneers directed their cruise to Bocca del Dragon, for the purpose of fishing for the sea-cow, called so because its mouth, teeth and nose resemble those of a cow. This species of fish is from twenty to twenty-four feet long, and good to eat, being in taste very much like to pork. Having pro- cured a quantity of this food, the Buccaneers continued their voyage. In a fortnight, during which time they were in great danger of per- ishing, from the leaky state of their vessels, they arrived at the bay of Blevelt, so named from a famous pirate who formerly resorted there. Here, while one party were engaged in refitting the vessels, the other roamed the woods killing the birds and monkeys. This last appears to have made great sport for the Buccaneers. Having nothing else on which to exercise their murderous propensities, they amused themselves ip firing at these counterfeit resemblances of the human race. After having shot a number of them, the diversion seemed to be to watch their death agonies, and observe the others come down from the trees, gather moss and herbs, and staunch the wounds of their dying com- panions, which they did ini the same manner, and with the same appa- rent concern, as if they were really human creatures. The Buccaneers were men emphatically of blood, and when, for the sake of plunder, they could not see it flow from men, they found their solace in causing it to flow for their diversion from monkeys. When the Buccaneers had been about nine days at this place, somo of their women, who were, as had been the custom with them, draw- ing water and washing on the shore, wandered near the wood. Sud- denly they perceived a troop of Indians. They gave the alarm, but before the men could get to their aid, two of their number were trans- fixed by the arrows of the savages. Although the Buccaneers imme- diately searched the woods, no- Indians could be found, they having fled as soon as they had discharged their arrows. The Buccaneers, fearing from this attack, that the Indians might soon return in greater force and overpower them, again embarked on board their ships, and Sailed onward. They soon came to Cape Gracias a Dios, on the Mosquito coast, whibh had long been a resort of pirates, who had always maintained a friendly intercourse with all the Mosquito Indians. Through this in- tercourse many of the natives were able to talk English and French, and being also expert fishermen with their javelins, they rendered themselves very useful in victualling the ships with tortoise and fish. As the buccaneers remained here for some time refreshing themselves, it will not be uninteresting to give a description of the Mosquito coun- try as they found it. : The nation consisted of about one thousand six hundred persons who formed a sort of commonwealth without any king or sovereign head. Part of them cultivated the ground, while the others led a     "       MORGAN, THE: BUCCANEER. wandering, lazy life, roaming about the coast and fishing. They wore no clothing except an apron of the bark of trees, beaten upon stones until it became soft. Their religion was about the same as that of their visitors the buccaneers. They had a faint idea of a God, but their ideas of worshipping him in any way were so much more faint, that they dispensed with the ceremony altogether. Their food consisted principally of banana, and other tropical fruits which grew spontane- ously on every side, and of excellent fish and crabs, which filled the waters in great abundance. They had two favorite drinks which were used on all occasions of festivity and ceremhony. The one'was' called achioc, and made of the bruised seeds of the paln tree, steeped in warm water, and then strained off; the other was a fermented juice of the plantanos. It was the custom of the natives to make great enter- tainments, especially to indulge in these two liquors. Great form and ceremony were used on these occasions. The males combed their hair and anointed their faces with oil, while the women adorned their fea- tures with a preparation resembling our crimson paint. When the guests approached, the host, carrying all his weapons, went out a few yards from his cottage to meet them, and falling flat on his face on the ground, rem ined perfectly motionless, while his guests lifted him on his feet agatin. Ai9 then would enter the hut, where the ceremony would be reversed, the guests falling down, and the host pieking them - up one by one. All being on their feet once more, a calabash contain- ing four quartso6f the anhioc was handed to each one, and he was ex- pected-to empty it. The host would then go round and gather together the calabashes, and this was called the first welcome. After this the revelry consisted in drinking the achioc at, pleasure, in songs and dances, and in libidinous caresses between the men and women, the men often wounding themselves in the most tender places, in order to show their great love for their crimson-dyed enchantresses. The marriage knot also was tied by the drinking of achioci and it was the otily ceremony used. The father of the young woman having examined the aspirer to her liand, to see if he could make arrows and bows, and darts for fishing, and having found him perfect in thesei points, would call to his daugliter to bring a calabash of achioc, of which, drinking first hirnself, he would then hand it to the bridegroom who in turn handed it to the bride, whose duty it was to drain it to the last drop. Thus by a calabash of achioc the two were made one. When a married man died, his wife buried all his arms, his aprons and ear jewels with hm, and for the space of one year afterwards brought every day to his grave, the choicest of meat and drink which she left there, as it was said, to appease the devil, and which that personage invariably came and carried away. When the year was up, she took her husband's bones from the grave, scraped and washed them, and having dried them in the sun, put them iira bag which she wore on her back during the day, and slept upon at night during the term- of one year longer, at the end of which time she hung the bag at the door of her house if she owned one, and if she did not, then she suspended the bag at the door of her next relation or neighbor. The Mosquito country in its outward features, seems to have been    MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER.         47 a favorite of nature, and to have received a large share of her favors. There were shady groves, watered by limpid streams, variegated with flowers of a thousand hues, and rendered vocal by the wild notes of feathered songsters with plumage as varied and brilliant in coloras that of the rainbow. There were trackless forests, dark dells, and rough ragged mountains-every form indeed in which nature moulds herself either into grandeur or beauty, while on every side the richest fruits sprang up on the luxuriant bushes, or hung down from the trees, inviting with tempting lusciousness the hand to cull them. It is not. strange that among a people so friendly as the natives of the Mosquito coast, among whom the greatest license was allowed, and whose country itself had such a power to charm, that the buccaneers should pause on their way in order that they might refresh themselves and give way to pleasure. They did so. Each one had his crimsoned- faced maiden whom he bought, as was the custom, for a hatchet or knife, and with her he lived in his little hut in the shady grove, while he was not engaged about the ships. At the great feasts of the achioc, the buccaneers were constant attendants, and were by no means inferior to their dusky hosts in their dexterity in the falling down and picking up ceremony, and in their attentions to the overflowing calabash. With the men of Mosquito, they sang and danced with the Mosquito maidens, and their gesticulations were as lewd and frantic as the orig- inals from which they copied. When the savage, mad with his intox- icating liquor, shouted long and loud in the frenzy of his excitement, then did the buccaneer shout longer and louder-the demon of civili- zation out-revelling as it were the demon of heathenism. The bucca- neers, in this pursuit of their pleasure, always took'care, when they gave an entertainment of the like kind, to invite the prettiest of the nlales, and the falling down and picking up became more interesting and exciting, the play resembling something like the toying of the tiger. In one thing only did the buccaneers violate the hospitality of their Mosquito friends, and indulge in their propensity to plunder. They invariably watched the graves of all the dead husbands, for they knew that the food deposited there was of the choicest kind, and worth a pirate's taking. The belief of the natives on this point became a joke among the buccaneers, and whenever one was seen with some- thing nice, the usual salutation was, "The devil has been ap- peased." Such was the country of the Mosquito coast, and thus did the pirates for a time possess it as a place of rest and revelry. Through such possession, since that time, has come the claim of England to its do- minion. English pirates were its first occupants, and to them England owes her present foothold there. It is a proud source through which to trace title. By it the pirate is elevated to the dignity of an English citizen, and by it the spirit of England herself is degraded to that of a pirate. The buccaneers having at length had enough of this enervating re- pose in the paradise of Mosquito, and having refitted and provisioned their ships, again embarked, and soon reached the island of De Los Pinos where they procured some wild cattle, which they salted and     A48        MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER. added to their stock. After remaining there a few days, they set sail towards Jamaica. On arriving at that port, the buccaneers found that the former gov- ernor, who had favored their enterprises, lhad been recalled to England, and a new one appointed in his place' The new governor, Sir John Vaughan, had given orders that the treaty then recently made between England and Spain would be put in force, and all pirates would there. after be treated with severity. The consequence of the proclamation was that most of the buccaneers retired to the island of Tortuga, al- though some few continued to sail out from the port in defiance, and committed depredations for which they were afterwards caught and hung, by order of the governor. CHAPTER X. Grand Rendezvous at Golden Island-Andreas the Dcarien Chief-Depar- ture for and march to Aganta Matria, .ing Golden Cap-Attack and burning of Santa Maria-Departure for Panama -Naval Battle be- fore it. SOME eight years after the dispersion at Chagres, consequent on the departure of Morgan, and after the events narrated in our last chapter, the buccaneers met once more in full force at Golden Island, near the mouth of the Gulf of Darien. Siee the expedition to Panama, their imaginations had been heated with visions of the rich plunder to be ob- tained in the South seas, and notwithstanding all the vigilance of tle new Governor of Panama, thev now came together to join in an enter prise by which their visions might be turned into reality. The force collected for the enterprise, amounted to three hundred and sixty tmen, consisting of the crews of the seven vessels which had brought them to the place of rendezvous. The object at first was a second descent on Panama; but a Darien Indian chief named Andreas. who had joined the buccaneers, drew such an enticing picture of a town called Santa Maria, situated on a river of the same name, which crosses the Isthmus of Darien, and empties into the South Sea, that the pirates resolved to march directly to that quarter. Andreas had informed the buccaneers that much gold was obtained in the moun- tains, about Santa Maria, and conveyed thence to Panama. All being in readiness, the buccaneers, leaving a small party to guard their ships, landed on the coast of Darien. They were divided into seven companies, which were commanded by five of the captains of the different vessels, each company bearing its distinguishing flag. The first division having a red flag, with a bunch of green and white ribbons, was led by Bartholomew Sharp ; the second, having a red flag, stripedwith yellow, by Richard Saw- kins; jthe third and fourth, with two green flags, by Peter Harris ;the fifth and sixth, with two red flags, by John Coxon; and the seventh with red colors, bearing the device of a hand and sword, by Edmund   MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER.        49 Cook. Every man was provided with four cakes of bread, and armed with a fusee pistil and a hanger. Ii this order, guided by the friendly Darien Indians, who hated the Spaniards, the march commenced. On the evening of the first day, the buccaneers found themselves on the banks of the river of which Andreas had told them, and there they rested for the night. The next day, the march continued along the river, and when at night, they again rested on its banks, the bucca- neers were overcome with fatigue, their course during the day having lain over a rough and precipitous mountain, where the path was so narrow, that but one man could pass at a time. The third day, still following the course of the river, they came to a village where dwelt the king of'the Darien Indians. Attended by his queen and two daughters, he came out in great state to meet the buccaneers as they approached. His crown was made of white reeds, curiously woven t9gether, and lined with red silk. Around the middle of the crown ran a strip of gold, bordered by golden beads, and the whole was sur- mounted with two immense ostrich feathers. A golden half-moon hung from his nose, while his ears were ornamented with golden rings near four inches in diameter. His person was enveloped in a white cotton robe, which hung in folds to his feet: The queen wore a red blanket, and the faces of the two daughters were painted with stripes of the same color. The buccaneers gave the king of Darien the title of the King of the Golden Cap, and partook bountifully of the hospi- talities, in the shape of plantains and sugar-cane, which he extended towards them. The king also had grievances of his own, of which he made the buccaneers his confidants. He informed them that a Span- iard at Santa Maria had run away with and ravished his eldest daugh- ter, whom he dearly loved--that his soul was burning with revenge, and that he was ready to join in the enterprise, in order that he might satiate his vengeance and redeem his child. The buccaneers' gladly received him and a patty of his warriors into their ranks, and thus re- inforced, resumed their course. On the evening of the fourth day, the buccaneers reached a point where the river began to be navigable, and here part of their force embarked the next morning in seventeen canoes, which had been pro- vided by the Indians, while the remainder continued the route by land. Previous, however, to starting, a quarrel arose between John Coxon and Peter Harris, two of the commanders. Coxon in his rage, fired his musket at Harris, and it was only by the others rushing for- ward and seizing Harris, that he was prevented from stabbing Coxon through the heart on the spot. On the eighth day, both parties of the buccaneers reached a beachy spot of land, where the river, being joined by another stream, .became broad and deep. Here the whole force of the buccaneers and Indians, consisting in all, of about six hundred men, embarked in sixty-eight canoes, and at midnight on the ninth day, arrived within half a mile of Sapta Maria. Having disembarked, they encamped in the woods and waited for the light of the morning. At daybreak they were awakened by the sound of the beating of drums, and the discharge of some small arms from the garrison of the towwn. As the Buccaneers emerged from the woods, they found the 4 i     60        MORGAN, TIE BUCCANEER. Spaniards ready to receive them. The fort of Santa Maria consisted of but a slight stockade, and although a pretty brisk fire from it was poured into the buccaneers as they approached, it was not able long to stand against their savage impetuosity. With yells and impreca- tions they threw themselves upon it, and pulling up the pallisades, and hewing down the Spaniards with their hangers, they stood in a few moments, with twenty-six of the garrison slain at their feet, mas- ters of the place, only two of their own number having been killed in the engagement. In their victory, however, the buccaneers were doomed to disappointment. The Spaniards had heard of their coming, and the Governor, the priest and the chief men had three days before made their escape, taking with them three hundred pounds of gold, and leaving only twenty behind, which was all the booty the pirates obtained. Instead alsoof finding a large town which they expected, there stood but a church and a few huts in the neighborhood of the fort. But two hundred Spaniards were found remaining either in the fort or town. No sooner was the engagement over, than the king of the Dariens, Golden Cap, together with his Indians, made search for his ravished daughter. He discovered her in one of the huts, abandoned by her betrayer, who, however, she said, was among the prisoners. On his being pointed out, the chief took him to the woods, bound him to a tree, and tearing out his entrails, tortured him to death with his lance. The other Indians followed their chief's example, and hurrying 'the wretched captives to the trees around the fort, were killing them in every form of savage cruelty, when the buccaneers, tired even them- selves with the sight of blood, put an end to the butchery. The buccaneers now resolved on the bold enterprise of following the river in their slender canoes to the South seas. It was a hazardous undertaking. A Spanish man-of-war might at any time meet them, and sink their frail vessels with little difficulty. But desperation at their ill success at Santa Maria, made them disregard every feeling but that of the desire of the gold. The gold which had just eluded their grasp, had been carried to Panama. There also were the treasures of the mines of Potosi and Peru, and to Panama therefore they would go, Having sent what plunder they had obtained, back to their ships, and having burnt the fort, the church, and town to the ground, the bucca- neers embarked again on bQard of their canoes. Of the Indians, An- dreas and Golden Cap, together with a few followers, alone accompa- nied them, the rest having returned to their homes. Previous to em- barkation, John Coxon was appointed comlnander-in-chief of all the forces. A day's sailing brought the buccaneers to the Gulf of San Miguel, and they were now fairly on the broad bosom of the South Sea. Two days more, and then they entered the vast Bay of Panama, without having encountered any opposition, and with spirits bounding with the hope of plunder. On their entrance into the bay, a bark was descried in the distance, and the canoe in which Captain Harris commanded, immediately gave chase. Fearful as the odds must have been against the canoe, yet such              ,   .   MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER.          1 was the determination of the pirates within it, that but a short time elapsed before they boarded and took the bark. It Was a vessel of thirty tons. The next day, they captured another bark of the same size, andt being now in something of a formidable condition, they at- tacked the island of Chepillo, at the mouth of the river Cheapo. Not much opposition encountered them at this place, and they soon effected a landing putting the inhabitants to flight, and taking fourteen negroes and mulattoes prisoners. They found here provisions and water, on which they refreshed themselves for a few hours, while their Indian companions, according to permission given them, amused themselves in torturing the prisoners to death. The feast being ended, the Buc- caneers held on their way through a storm of driving rain, which con- tinued'all night, but gave place il the morning to a cloudless sky and a brilliant sun, revealed in whose red light, the pirates saw rising be- fore them, as if from the sea, the towers and spires of the long looked for Panama. In the meantime, the coming of the Buccaneers-had been expected at the city, and preparations lad been made accordingly. Eight large vessels rode at anchor before the town, three of which immediately ad- vanced towards the pirates, to put a stop to their further approach. Of the three Spanish ships, one was commanded-by Don Jacinto de Barahona' the high admiral of those seas; one by Don Francisca de Peralto, and the third by Don Diego de Carabaxal. The crews of all turce amounted to about three hundred and eight men, consisting part of Europeans, and part of negroes and mulattoes. The Buccaneer k)rce numbered about two hundred, all rowing in their canoes, the barks which they had previously taken h11ving been sent on an expe- dition to seek for fresh water. About an hour after sunrise the canoes and. ships came together. The ship of Don Carabaxal ran in between the two canoes commanded by Sawkins and Risbone, firing its broadsides on either side, but doing very little damage. Not being very quick in coming about, the Buc- caneers rose in their boats and poured a volley on the decks of Don Carabaxal, which swept them of six of his best men. By this time, the Admiral's ship came up, but the canoes were ready for him, and at the first shot, the Admiral's nman at the helm fell dead on the deck. This enabled the pirates to run under her very stern, from whence they kept firing at the helm as fist as the men approached to take it. They cut also to pieces with their shot the main sheet and braces of the ves- sel. But now the ship of Don Peralta came to the rescue. Captain Sawkins immediately engaged this ship in a hot contest, leaving to the other canoes the pmanagement of the Admiral and the Carabaxal. This last ship, in her turn)had tacked about, and now endeavored to drive the canoes from the stern of the Admiral, but two of the canoes met her midway in her advance, and engaged her so closely that they were on the point of boarding her, when she gave them the helm, and fairly turned in flight. In the meantime, the canoes at the stern of the Admiral kept up their deadly fire, raking at every volley the decks of that vessel, and covering them with blood. The Admiral himself, while waving his handkerchief for the Carabaxal to come to his aid,     52        tMORZGAN, THE B'UCCANEER, was shot through the heart, and his chief pilot soon lay dead by Isi side. The battle now raged in all its fury. On the one hand, the Spaniards fought with desperation, to rid their coast of the most fiend- ish marauders; on the other hand, with the Buccaneers, it was fight or die, for their foes had proclaimed that no quarter should be given, The huge volumes of smoke, rising up between the sea and the red rays of the morning sun, resembled so many clouds of rolling fire. while the roar of the cannon and muskets, mingled with the shouts and imprecations of the contending parties, and reverberated by the shores around, rose on the air like voices from the pit of demons. The canoes under the stern of the Admiral soon wedged her rudder, and then, with hangers and pistols in hand, the crews mounted her sides, and poured themselves on her decks with 4n impetuosity that swept all be- fore it. Harris and Coxon led them on, and the battle was soon turned into a massacre. The Spaniards, with their leader slain, and their numbers fearfully diminishing at every swing of the hangers of their merciless enemies, cried for quarter, and then the Buccaneers, up to their ankles in blood, sent forth a shout of victory over the waters. Peter Harris, a brave man, atthough a pirate, raised himself on the deck where he had fallen, shot through both of his legs, and in his death agony joined the exulting chorus. The conquerors of the Admiral, having put their wounded on board of their prize, now sent the canoes to the aid of Captain Sawkins, who during all this time, had been contending single-handed with the Pe- ralta. Three times had that courageous pirate, with unequalled bravery, boarded the Peralta and been driven back. It was at the juncture of a last attempt, that his companions joined him, and pour- ing into the Peralta a volley of shot, expected to have seen it returned, but instead of thereof, saw an explosion abaft the mast of that vessel, which blew numbers of its crew to pieces, scattering their mangled remains on the decks and into the sea. The explosion arose from a jar of powder on the deck, which had been fired by a shot from the Buccaneers. In vain the Captain of the Peralta endeavored to restore - order among his men, and fought with despairing 'courage himself. Confusion prevailed, and amid the smoke and disorder, Sawkins again  boarded the doomed vessel to find her an easy prey. Scarcely a man remained alive on her decks, which were covered with dead. The black skins of the negroes presented a most hideous appearance, hav- ing, in many places, been burned white with the powder. The Buccaneers, after the battle, which had lasted until noon, found that eighteen of their men had been killed and twenty-two wounded, while but twenty-five of the crews of the two ships which they had taken, remained alive, out of the one hundred and fifty who had manned them when the engagement commenced. The prisoners were now brought forward and interrogated by Cap- tain Sawkins, with reference to the number of men that were in the five ships lying off Panama, and which had not joined in the fight. The Captain of the Peralta answered, that the largest contained three hundred sailors and marines. One of his men, who was dying on the deck, raised himself up and denied, with an oath, his captain's asser-   MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER.         53 lion, saying that there was not a soul in any of the ships, but that all had been removed -to man the three that had come out to meet the * Buccaneers. The Buccaneers immediately hastened to take possession of these vessels, and were repaid with a rich booty. The largest of the five, called the La Trinidad, or the Blessed Trinity, had a cargo of four hundred tons, consisting of wine, sugar, and sweetmeats. The second was laden with iron, and this ship the buccaneers burnt, as there was no probability of the Spaniards redeeming the commodity which it contained, while it was too much trouble for the pirates to unload and throw it overboard. The third was laden with one hun- dred and eighty tons of sugar, while the remaining two were filled with flour and meal. This victory was one of the greatest that the Buccaneers ever obtained. Three- men-of-war contended against some eight or ten frail canoes, and the number of fighting men in the one was double of that in the other; yet the slender canoes, guided by the superior skill and demoniac bravery of their crews, carried the 'day against the fearful advantage of cannon, ships, and numbers. The Buccaneers were indeed the scourge of every sea on which they made their appear- ance.  The pirates now formed a close blockade of Panama, not deeming themselves in sufficient force as yet to attack it. The first thing which they did, after the confusion of the battle was over and they had put their prizes in something like fighting order, was to bury Peter Harris one of their captains, who had fallen. The ceremony was conducted with great solemnity, and strange as it may seem for iese men of blood, with religious rites. Farris was a native of the ",nty of Kent, in England, had long been -              s for his valor, and the countenap .i many of ile fierce menl ,'ound bore the undeniable traces of ; as they saw the body of their compan- ion sink beneath the s, of the sea. Several days after John Coxon, one of the buccaneer captains, declared his deternr ,on to leave the fleet and return to the ships at Golden Island. I  ms that there had been, since the naval engage- ment, many refit ,s past upon his conduct. It was said that he was backward in br  ,g up his forces to battle, and some of the bucca- neers went sr as to brand him as a coward; The pirates made no opposition  its departure, and taking with him about sixty of the men, he c  d his course for the mouth of the Santa Mafia river. The two  ian chiefs, Andreas. and Golden Cap, who had behaved with gr .n bravery at 'the late battle, also accompanied him, as they wished to be once more among their own people; they therefore took thechance of his escort, as it seemed the only one which they would probably get for some time. Golden Cap, however, to show his confi- dence in the buccaneers, confided to their care his nephew and son, who lhad also at the same time with him joined the expedition. Sawkins was now chosen by acclamation, as the Commander-in-Chief of all the buccaneers, and as he was one of the. most celebrated of their captains after Morgan, we shall reserve for another chapter, the narra- tive of the remaining actions of his career.     54        MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER. C HAPTER XI. The Buccaneers at vo-Their Mart of Commerce Established T/here-- Capture of a Government Ship- Correspondence with the Bishop and Governor-Attack on Peubla Nuevd-Bravery and Death of Captain Sawkins-Election'of a New Chief. THE buccaneers refrained from attacking Panama, but put it, as it were, in a state of blockade with their little force, sending out in the meantime their barks to cruise the neighboring waters irY quest of plunder. These cruises met with considerable success, having captured several barks laden generally with provisions. Having remained thus some ten days before Panama, the buccaneers again weighed anchor in search of new enterprises. They steered their course first to the island ofTavoga, on which was situated a town containing about one hun- dred houses. This town fell an easy prey into their hands. The sight of their vessels bearing down upon it was enough for the in- habitants, and when with their wild shoutings the buccaneers rushed upon the dwellings, they found them, with the exception of a few negroes, who had not been quite quick enough, entirely deserted. The rest of the terror-stricken people had fled in consternation into the interior of the island. This spot, besides possessing many natural charms to entice the buccaneers to make it for a time a resting place, also commanded a full view of Panama, and enabled them to seee very vessel that entered and left that port. Sawkins, therefore, determined for the present to make it his head-quarters. Revelry, mingled with business, was the oidler of the day. Sawkins was a man of much acuteness, and, from long experience, knew not only all about buccaneer warfare, but also everything which related to buccaneer trade. While therefore he deemed it impolitic to attack the city of Panama in order to obtain by force its gold and silver, he determined to handle its coin by taking advantage of that class of merchants which is to be found in all cities, and which, in the way of business, knows no distinction between a pirate, smuggler, or an honest man. With this in view, Sawkins opened a commercial. mart at Tovoga, and caused it to be known at Panama that the goods which he had Stolen, and the negroes whom he had made prisoners, he was ready to sell in exchange for money and other articles which he needed. The merchants from Panama came, and buccaneer trade was brisk, each negro bringing two hundred pieces of eight. In every instance Sawkins behaved as a man of honor towards his commercial customers. They came and departed in safety, and not a violent or unruly hand was laid upon them without prompt interference on the part of the commander himself,  While on the island, one of these merchants delivered to Sawkins a message from tho'governor of Panama, the purport of which was to inquire why the buccaneers ;had invaded those seas, and to demand the release of the captain of the Peralta, and the othervprisoners. Sawkins   MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER.         55 returned for answer that he came to assist the king of the Darien Indians, who was the rightful lord of Panama and all the surrounding country, that if he (the governor) would send five hundred pieces of eight for each prisoner, and not annoy the Indians any further, but suffer them to use their power as became the lords of the soil, then the buccaneers would depart, but otherwise they would remain and com- mit all the depredations which they could. By the same merchant, Sawkins also learned that a certain bishop whom he had formerly taken prisoner in an expedition against Santa Martha, and who had been ransomed, was now a resident of Panama. As a sort of remem- brance therefore, he sent the bishop a couple of loaves of sugar, desiring him to shrive the governor and advise him to comply with the modest demands of the buccaneers. The merchant brought back a gold ring as a return present from the bishop, and an inquiry from the governor concerning the source from which Sawkins held his com- mission. Sawkins told the merchant to give his thanks to the bishop, and inform the governor that his commission Was in the muzzle of his guns, and that when he hadccollected his full force together, he would visit him at Panama, and make him read it in plain characters by the light of gunpowder. The buccaneers while at Tavoga did not, however, confine themselves to trade and diplomacy. They kept their eyes ever fixed on the blue waters before them, and watching for their prey. A few days after their arrival, a large vessel appeared off the island and their ships were soon upon her. Sawkins himself took the lead, and although the crew of the ill-fated bark fought well and bravely, she was soon in the hands of the buccaneers. She proved to be a rich prize, for she con- tained, beside two thousand jars of wine, and fifty of gunpowder, fifty- one thousand pieces of eight in money. She had sailed from the city of Truxillo, and the money had been sent to pay the garrison at Panama. The captain of the ship, when brought before Sawkins, be- sought him in terror ,to spare his life, promising to conduct him to places where heaps of treasure could be found, and particularly to Guayaquil, where he informed Sawkins, that he might load his vessel with gold instead of silver. This golden promise had the desired effect, his litl was spared, but the rest of the crew were put to the sword by their merciless captors. The buccaneers also learnt from the captain that a rich ship was coming from Lima in a few days, having with her one hundred thousand pieces of eight. Elevated with this success, and with a richer hope before them, the revelry of the buccaneers arose that night to madness. The wine cup flowed unchecked, both on'board the ships and in the houses on the island, and the commanders of the Peralta and of the ship last taken, were made with others of the prisoners to join in the bacchanalian orgies. In the madness of their intoxication, they set fire to one of the houses during the night, and twelve of the dwellings Were destroyed before the flames could be quenched. The buccaneers remained at Tavoga ten days after the last occur- rence, trading with the Panama merchants as we have before stated, and watching the sea for the expected ship from Lima. Still she came     56        MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER. not, although the capture of another vessel from Truxillo confirmed the previous intelligence of her being on the way. At length, tired of waiting, the buccaneers panted for action, and thronging around Saw- kins, were clamorous to depart on some new expedition. He yielded to their importunity and determined to set out for Guayaquil, but this the men demurred to, for although at some future time they expressed themselves ready for that enterprise, yet now their thoughts were bent on the island of Cayboa, which was famous for its pearl fishery. Saw- kins himself saw nothing very promising in an expedition to Cayboa, ,and therefore strenuously opposed it, but the general voice was against him and he was obliged to give up his predilections in favor of his men. Having set sail, the buccaneers soon arrived and anchored off the island of Cayboa. But disaster this time followed their path. During the passage, a violent gale arose in which one of their smaller barks was foundered, carrying down with her tWenty-two of the men. The island of Cayboa, as Sawkins expected, offered nothing for the grasp of plunder, as everything of value on it or about it consisted of some red deer in its woods, a few tortoise in its waters, and some oysters on its shores, which last, one of the buccaneers in his account of the ex- pedition states, were "the biggest I ever ate in my life, insomuch that I was obliged to cut them into four pieces, each quarter being a mouthful." About eight leagues from Cayboa was situated on the main land a town called Puebla Nueva. On this Sawkins resolved to make an attack, having, however, no particular idea of what he should gain by it, but taking as it were the chances, in the absence of other induce- ments to action. He was accompanied by Captain Sharp and about sixty men, When they arrived at the mouth of the river on which the town is situated, they embarked in canoes, being guided by one of their negro prisoners who was acquainted with the way. The in- habitants of Puebla Neuva who had been well aware that the bucca- neers were in the neighborhood, prepared in this instance to defend themselves. The buccaneers accordingly found on their approach to the town that three strong breastworks had been erected to bar their further progress. Sawkins, however, and his menl did not know the name of fear, and the galling fire, which was immediately opened upon then as they advanced, had no power to cause them to turn back. Sawkins saw at once that he had not brought force enough with him, and that the affair was a desperate one. By the time he reached the first breastwork, three of his men had fallen, and four were wounded; but he faltered not, and calling on the remainder to follow him, he made an attempt to scale the barrier which was formed of earth and trees. With a bound like that of a tiger, he leaped upon its very top, in the mouth, as it were, of death. The pirates inspired with his courage, followed close upon him, and the battle was now hand to hand and steel to steel. For a brief space, the contest of the barricades was a deadly one; but numbers were against the buccaneers, and al- though their opponents fell in piles around them, it was all in vain. Sawkins himself was soon borne to the earth by six of his enemies,   MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER.         57 who had thrown themselves as one man upon him, and disarmed him. It was then that he exhibited one pf those feats of strength for which his gigantic frame and-immense power of muscle had always rendered him celebrated. Like some smothered volcano, which heaves from its breast the pohderous stones which would weigh it down, he sprung once more to his feet, hurling four of his adversaries far over on either side of the barrier, while he grappled, as with a vice, the throats of the remaining two. Thrdwn again to the ground with'them, by others who rushed to their assistance, he did not relax his hold, but in his own death agonies, as knife after knife of the Spaniards entered his body, he tightened the fatal clutch, and when at last the buccaneer chief lay dead on the barrier which he had with such desperate courage strove to win, his two throttled foes lay stark and black beside him. Their leader fallen, Sharp and his surviving comrades, seeing that the fortune of the battle was against them, waited but to get possession of the body of Sawkins, which having accomplished, they retreated in good order to their canoes, and were soon on board their ships. In their way down the river of Puebla Nueva, they had the good fortune to capture a small vessel, laden with indigo, butter and pitch. The result of this attack on the town of Puebla threw a gloom over the buccaneers, although they were men not in the habit of giving way to anything like despondency. Sawkins, their fallen chief, was one of the few of their commanders whom they had loved. They had feared and admired Morgan, but hated him. The qualities of bravery and fiery energy, characteristic of Morgan, had all been possessed by Sawkins, but he added to them a certain generosity of spirit which is not without its power over the most savage of natures, and while there- fore the buccaneers gave to Sawkins the full tribute of awe and admi- ration for the one,. they gave him also a large bounty of affection for the other. They, therefore, buried him with grief, and turned with gloomy feling to elect another to fill his place. Sharp waxs now chosen the cormmander-in-chief, but the choice was far from giving satisitetion. .A number of the pirates rose in open mutiny and declared their intention of returning across the Isthmus to the rendezvous at Golden Ilandln, as Captain Coxon had done before. Sharp immediately called a council of war on board the La Trinidad, the largest of the buccaneer ships. Being all collected on the deck, he made a speech, for Sharp was a man of considerable information, and was not deficient in eloquence. Ife began by informing the buc- caneers that the design of their late chief w;as to lhave made a complete exploration of the South seas, and then return home by-the way of the Stlrits of Magellan. He then pictured, in glowing colors, the advan- tage of carrying out in unity this design, and assured them that it would doubtless be worth a thousand pounds to each man who would remain and give his aid towards this end. He concluded by request- ing those who were in favor of completing the enterprise to take the 'right side of the deck, and those in favor of returning immediately to Golden Island to range themselves on the left. 'Sixty-three of the buccaneers immediately filed off to the left; taking with them King Goldencap's son and the rest of the Indians. v     583 fMORGAN, THE BUCCANEER. For some days after their departure, Sharp and the buccaneers re- maining with him, amused themselves in hunting the deer on the island of Cayboa, and eating oysters. When about to depart from the island, a dispute arose between Captain Cook and the men on board of his ship, in which Captain Cook blew out the brains of one of the pirates. This exasperated his comrades to such a degree that Sharp had to exert all his authority before order was restored. The breach was finally healed by Sharp's transferring Cook to his own ship, the La Trinidad, and placing John Cox, a native of New England, in command of Cook's former vessel. The former Spanish commander of the Peralta, who still remained a prisoner of the Buccaneers, was also sent on board of John Cox's ship, as Sharp feared a collusion be- tween him and the former captain of the government vessel which they had lately captured off the island of Tavoga. This latter personage now undertook to guide the buccaneers to Guayaquil, where he had previously told Sawkins that there were such heaps of gold and silver. The last night of their departure from Cayboa, a violent tempest arose among the fleet of the buccaneers. It wag one of those terrific contests of the elements, in the contemplation of which all human warfare sinks into utter insignificance, and the cheek of the stoutest heart becomes blanched with fear. The wind howled in fury around the strained and creaking masts; the thunder rolled and reverberated over the wide waste of waters, while the livid sheets of lightning illu- minated at intervals with fearful. brightness the awful picture of those few frail barks freighted with fierce-visaged men, and tossed like whisps of straw in the grasp of the raging billows. Even the bucca- neers trembled for once beneath a power greater than their own. The buccaneers, however, escaped without much damage, and continued to sail on for two days under a heavy rain, at the end of which time they made the island of Gorgona, being advised thereto by the prisoner, i the former commander of the Peralta before spoken of, to stop. He informed them that this island was very little frequented by the Spa. niards, and on this account the buccaneers at once chose it as a secure hartor where they might stop and refit their vessels which had been somewhat shattered by the storm. The buccaneers gave this island the name of Sharp's Isle, in commemoration of its being their first landing place under the command of their new leader. After remaining here for five days and putting their ships in coln- plete order, the buccaneers prepared again to depart. Much contention hereupon arose as to what course they should pur- sue. Sharp, for some unexplained reason, had abandoned all idea of Guayaquil, and the buccaneers were at a loss. Some proposed one way, and some another, until at lengthl an old sailor, who had been much with the Spaniards, arose and gave a glowing account of a place called Arica. He said that all the plate of the south seas was gathered there-that it was brought thither from 'Potosi, Chuquisaca, and the other places where it was dug from the mines, and he had no doubt that each might realize two thousand pounds by this expedition. The old buccaneer carried the day.   MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER.         59 CHAPTER XII. The Buccaneers pass San Frantcisco.--They take a valuable prize.-Attack and Capture of Serena.-The Earthquake.-Spanish stratagem to burn their Ships./ [Mutiny and Election of a new Chief--Disastrous attack on Arica, THE buccaneers left Gorgona in the latter part of the month of. July, and on the 5th of August they passed San Francisco, which is described by .them as "full of white cliffs on all sides," and having a large deep bay, the circumference whereof is full of pleasant hills." On the 12th of August they touched at the Island of Plata, which takes its name from the fact that Sir Francis Drake here divided among his men a vast quantity of plate which he had collected together by his plunder in these seas. It would seem from this that Sir Francis Drake, although an English Admiral, and one of England's most celebrated' naval heroes, was in his day also something of a buccaneer and a pi- rate, The buccaneers caught at this island, a number of goats and tortoises. These they salted down for provisions, and then again set sail. On the 24th of August, the buccaneers came in sight of Guayaquil, the townm which Saw kins, as we mentioned before, had designed pre- vious to his death, to attack and plunder. While in view of the town. the pirates discovered a. ship some distance ahead of them. They came up with her just when the darkness of night was settling on the sea, and they commanded her to lower her sails. Her captain replied that lie would make their captain lower his own. The consequence was a battle, when the buccaneers soon killed the man at the' helm of the ship, and otherwise so disabled her, that their victims cried for quarter, and the pirates boarded the ship in triumph. They found in her three thousand two hundred pieces of eight, besides one and thirty fire arms. On examining the captain of the ship, he informed the buc- caneers that the Viceroy of Peru, hearing of their being in the South Seas, had fitted out three large men-of-war, which were now ready, at different points, to intercept the buccaneers in their lawless schemes of plunder. He also told the pirates that lle himself had been sent out by the Governor of Guayaquil to discover them, and that if he did so, he was to run away if he could, and bring the intelligence, but if not, he was to fight. He had tried to run away, but he could not, therefore he had fought, and was sorry to say that he was beaten. When the captain had finished his relation, a friar who had been his chaplain on board his ship, launched out in the most bitter invectives against the buccaneers, and called down the vengeance of Heaven on their heads. The buccaneers made short work of him. They shot him. through the head in the midst of his anathemas, and threw his body overboard. The buccaneers now sunk the vessel which Captain Cox commanded, in consequence of its being in a very leaky condition, and having     60' MORG N, THE BUCCANEER. taken their prisoners on board the La Trinidad, resumed their voyage. On the 4th of September they captured another bark filled with cocoa-nuts and packages of silk. -They now selected out the least im- portant of their prisoners, and putting them in this prize, turned them adrift, giving them water and provisions enough for a few days. On the 26th of October the buccaneers arrived off the town of Ari- ca, which they had destined to take, but they found that the inhabi- tants had heard of their coming and were prepared for them. The Aricans appearing in such an impregnable state of defence, the buc- caneers abandoned their attack for the present, and steered for the town of Hilo. This place they took without much difficulty, and found in it a great quantity of pitch, tar, oil, wine, and various kinds of provi- sions. In plundering this town, they discovered in its neighborhood an extensive sugar mill. The proprietors of the mill offered to ran  gom it and its contents, by delivering at the port eighty fat beeves on the following day. The appointed day came, and no beeves were de- livered. The buccaneers, in their rage, burned the buildings to the ground, with all their contents, except as much sugar as they could conveniently bring away with them. On the 2d of December, the buccaneers anchored off the coast near to a large town called Serena. They disembarked immediately, and marched towards it. The Spaniards, however, as on former occasions, had notice of their approach, and met them on the road with a large body of horse. A sharp battle followed, but the buccaneers were victorious, and their enemies turned in flight. The pirates followed, but the Spaniards, with considerable cunning, led them out of the way of the town, and it was some time before the pirates found that they had been - deceived. They then abandoned the pursuit, and soon explored their way across the fields to the town, which they found deserted, all the inhabitants having fled, carrying with them their gold and jewels. On the morning after the buccaneers had taken the place, a party of Span. iards appeared, bearing a flag of truce. They were; received by the pirates with great ceremony, and the issue of the interview was, that the Spaniards offered to ransom the city, by paying on the next day, 95,000 pieces of eight, if the pirates would leave without burning or destroying it. The offer was accepted, and the buccaneers waited with impatience for the dawn. The night, however, was one full of terror for them. Heaven and the Spaniards both seemed to have joined to- gether to pour out the vials of their wrath on the pirates. The earth was convulsed with one of those appalling earthquakes so peculiar to the climate, and the Spaniards, coming out of their hiding-places in the neighboring mountains, opened a sluice and deluged the town with the water. The imprecations of the buccaneers, during the whole night, rose like the voices of fiends upon the air; and when the morn- ing came, and the Spaniards appeared not with the ransom, they turned with yells of rage, and applied the burning brand to every church and dwelling. Three ecclesiastics, whom they found in one of the churches, they cast headlong into the flames, mockingly telling .thehi, that they died as martyrs, and that their flocks, when they returned to   MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER.         81 the burning ruins, would canonize them. i Thus did the Buccaneers leave Serena. When they arrived at their ships, they found the party which they had left in charge, in a state of great commotion. It seems that a Spaniard on the shore, who possessed more boldness than prudence, had blown up a horse's hide like a bladder, and upon this had floated underJ the stern of one of the buccaneer ships. Here, without being observed by the pirates, he crammed oakum and brimstone be- tween the rudder and sternpost, fired it with a match, and then made good his retreat on his water-horse fo the shore. The smoke soon be- gan to rise about the decks, and the pirates started up in alarm. For some moments the greatest confusion prevailed, but at length the place of the fire was discovered, and the flames were quenched before much damage was done. On going to the shore, a little time afterwards, they found the hide lying on the ground, with the match still burning beside it, and thus detected the source from whence had come the in- tended blow. At this place the buccaneers released their principal prisoners, as the continued watching which they required, independent of the expense of keeping them, had already become a serious burden, The pirates alsQ feared that this last attempt of one of their country- men, whichl proved so nearly successful, might, perhaps, lead them to make similar ones, in order to obtain their liberty. Pursuing now their voyage, the buccaneers soon reached the island of Juan Fernandez. They landed on Christmas-day, firing a volley of small arms in honor of the festival. They remained here for some time, hunting the wild goats and exploring the inlets and bays. Here also, dissensions arose among them, which soon ripened into mutiny. While the apparent cause of the quarrel was a difference of opinion, on the question whether they should return home, or continue their expe- dition, the real reason seems to have been an ill feeling, on the part of the pirates, against Captain Sharp, because he had acquired in the ex- pedition, so far, some thousand pounds, while they were not worth a cent. Sharp had been prudent and kept his money, while they had lost theirs by playing at dice. The difficulty at length rose to such a height, that the opponents of Sharp openly declared that they would obey him no longer, and that a new chief must be elected, or they would leave. As this party composed a large majority, they soon car- ried the day, and Sharp was 'deposed the command. An old English privateer, by the name of John Watling, was chosen in his place.- Watling was a short, thick-set man, powerful in muscle, not deficient in courage, and what was curious, of a devotional turn of mind. He was, in fact, a religious privateer, and the first thing which he did, on assuming the command, was to hold a regular serv:ce, according to the rights of the English church, on board of the ships. A few days after the election of Watling, three large men-of-war appeared off the island, and the buccaneers immediately slipped their cables and stood out to sea. No engagement, however, followed-both parties contenting themselves to run up their flags, as if in defiance of each other; but both rather afraid to commence the battle. The buccaneers had nothing but musketry and swords to rely on, and the men-of-war were well     62        IMORGAN, THE BUCCANEER. mounted-with some twenty-five guns, and manned with six times the number of the pirates. The Spaniards, on the other hand, dreaded the 'very name of buccaneer, and although they had now co'ne out, with a sufficient force, on purpose to pursue and capture the foe, their courage failed them when the foe looked them: in the face. The two parties watched each other until the night interrupted the view, and when tlhe morning came, the men-of-war had gone, and the buccaneers were again sailing alone on the broad ocean. They reached in a few days the island of Yqueque, on which there was a small settlement. A party was at once landed to take possession of the place. This was easily accomplished, and the party soon re- turned to the ships, bringing with them four prisoners, two white men and two Indians. One of these Indians, who wiis an old man, when brought before Watling to be examined, gave such a confused account of the town of Arica, that Watling told him he was lying, and ordered him to be shot. The town of Arica, which the buccaneers now resolved to attack, was the outlet of the principal mining districts of South America, and accordingly more or less of the precious metals were always on depo- sit there. T'lhie town was square, having on each of its sides a breast- work, and large fort at one of the angles. The night following the taking of Yqueqtae, the buccaneers, with Watling at their head, em- barked in their canoes, and rowed for the main land. They reached it just before daylight, but concealed themselves among the rocks and bushes, until the darkness of night should favor their further progress. When night came, they rnade their way quietly along the shore until they reached a point about four miles south of Arica, where they tlanled one hundred men, leaving the rest to guard the canoes, and come to their aid on appointed signals being given. It was now sun- rise, and a brisk march soon brought the invading party directly in front 'of the town. They found it in a complete state of defence; but the buccaneers, although the odds were fearfully against them, faltered not. Watling made an inspiring speech, and even called on the God of battles to aid them. He himself with forty of his men, made an impetuous attack on the fort, while the rest threw themselves with savage fury on the breastworks. The battle in a few moments was general, and both par- ties fought with desperation. Watling soon found that he could not take the fort, being repulsed with loss as fast as he advanced. He therefore turned to aid the rest of his men at the breastworks. The buccaneers at those points being thus reinforced, soon drove the Ari- cans before them, and triumphantly poured themselves into the town. Once there, they caused the streets to flow with the blood of the in- habitants, until Watling put a stop to the carnage, by commanding them to give quarter, but secure every man, woman and child as prisoners. This accomplished, he collected all his forces together, and made a second attack on the fort; but notwithstanding he and his fol- lowers fought like demons, they were obliged to fall back. He now adopted one of these infernal measures, the contemplation of which makes the blood curdle with horror. Placing all the prison.   MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER.          63 ers, male and female, in front of his band, he commanded the fort to surrender, or with this vanguard, he should again advance in the face of their fire. The Spaniards steeled their hearts with the thought that better perhaps that their wives, children and relatives should thus die, than the whole should become the prey and victims of these merci- less monsters, and they, therefore, told the' buccaneers to come on.- They did come on, and language is powerless to describe the scene which followed. The bound and wretched victims fell shrieking to the earth; while the pirates yelling and cursing, trampled over their bodies as they advanced again to the attack. But it was in vain-the Spaniards this time fought with too much skill, and possessed too much force for their opponents. The buccaneers were in a desperate condition. Failing in this third attempt on the fort, they turned to retreat, and found that they were now surrounded on. all sides by large reinforcements of the Spaniards. who were fast arriving. One only resource was left them, which was to cut their way through to their canoes. Watling calling on them to follow, rushed forward; but the words were no sooner out of his mouth, than he fell a corpse, pierced with a musket ball. Sharp, with great bravery, stepped for- ward to take his place-the men hailed him as their comnmander, on the spot, and all rushing as onie man against the Spaniards, cut their way out of the town and made for the shore. Thle Spaniards poured down rocks and stones from the hills upon them, as they retreated; but they succeeded in reaching their canoes and returning to their ships, where all they could tell their companions was, that half of their number was slain-that they had a bloody fight all day, and not a piece of the gold or silver of Arica was in their posscssion.

OUR last chapter ended with the defeat of the buccaneers before the town of Arica, the fall of their leader Watling, the re-election of Sharp as their chief, and their return to their ship. It may be imagined that their feelings under their disappointed hopes were none of the mildest, and that if in their breasts there arose some slight despondency, there also swelled a larger share of that fiendish rage which ever urged them on with a force not to be resisted. With such feelings, the buccaneers again trimmed their sails, and were soon cutting their way through the waters of the South Seas. Nothing of any moment occurred for several days, except the dis- tribution of'some remains of a former plunder, which they had not as yet found time amid their late exciting enterprises to divide. This they now brought on deck, and it was not until after much strife and     "        MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER contention that an equal division of it was accomplished. Thirty-seven pieces of eight fell to the share of each man. After cruising about for some weeks, the buccaneers made their next landing at the port of Guasco. This place was under the control of a deputy governor and a friar, and was tributary to the town of Serena. which we mentioned in our last, as having been taken and ravaged by the buccaneers. At Gunsco, there was quite a number of houses, to- gether with a church. The inhabitants had descried the buccaneers at sea, and haI fled, carrying with them most of their plate and jewels. When the buccaneers landed, they found but one Indian and the old friar remaining. The friar was just issuing from the church porch to make his escape, when the rude hands of' the pirates were laid upon him, and when he recovered fron -the fright which the grasp occasion- ed him, he found himself bound fast to one of the pillars of his church, and his savage captors thronging around him with inflamed counte- nances and angry gestures, demanding of him to show where he had concealed his treasure. The friar, however, by this time having gained some courage, answered that he had n o treasure, and that the church was poor and had nothing to conceal. This, however, did not satisfy the buccaneers, and with curses, they threatened him with torture and death if he did not reveal. But the friar remained resolute, and the pirates finally telling him that they would leave him to his reflections for a while, turned their attention now to their Indian prisoner. He by signs signified to them that he would conduct them to a place back in the country, where they would find some booty. The buc- caneers were not slow in following, and after leading them over barren hills and through fertile valleys for about some seven miles, he at last stopped at the entrance of a large cave, but whose mouth or entrance was closed up, and from the sounds which they heard within,.appeared to be guarded. The buccaneers, thinking that the Indian had be- trayed them in a trap, turned with fury upon him, but he soon made them understand, that the cave was full of jewels and money, that he was not aware that it would have been occupied, but expected on the contrary, that those who had concealed the treasure there would have left it, under the impression that it was safe and secure from even the remotest knowledge of the pirates. He further informed them that there could not be any formidable force in the cave. The buccaneers having come -o far, were not inclined to suffer the prize to elude their grasp. TIhey therefore called on those within to surrender, and the answer they receivcd was the discharge of a few arquebuses through one of the fissures of the stones which blocked up the entrance. This, however, did not deter them. Although with the loss of several men, the buccaneers at length succeeded in piling around the mouth of the cavern, a quantity of brushwood, and other combustible matter to which they set fire, and waited the issue of their inhuman plan. A few more volleys from within, and all was still. The pirates thinking that the suffocation from the smoke had done its work, and feeling the gold and silver almost within their grasp, rushed forward to clear away the burning brands and force an entrance; but at that moment, a fear- ful explosion burst upon their ears, the cave before them seemed to   MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER.         66 part to its very centre, and then to close again as the falling rocks and torn up earth sunk into the yawning gap. The victims whom they sought to destroy,-had assisted in the work of death themselves, and rather than their enemies should triumph over their corpses in the pos- session of their wealth, had fired a train of powder, and thus in the agonies of death had foiled the purpose of the hated marauder. Two of the buccaneers who were in advance were killed by the explosion, and the rage of the rest rose to fury, as they saw buried before them, the spoil, which but a moment before they had felt so sure of securing. Having no object on which to wreak their vengeance, they would have sacrificed the poor Indian on the spot, had not the policy of re- taining him as a guide on their return to Guasco retained them. Again disappointed, the buccaneers retraced their steps to the church where they had left the friar. Here, with a few jars of wine which they found in the town, they held a carousal through the whole night. The aisles and arches resounded to their shouts and obscene songs, mingled with their imprecations on the bound ecclesiastic, whom at intervals they tortured, by piercing him with their bayonets, in order to make him reveal where he had hidden the treasure of the church. But it was all in vain, the friar continued firm, and the buccaneers, after tearing up the pavements of the church, and demolishing the al- tar, gave over the search, and resigned themselves entirely to their wild revelry until morning. At the dawn of day, binding the -Indian to the pillar, beside the friar, and leaving them both to whatever fate might befal them; they issued forth to make a more thorough examina- tion of the town. They succeeded in obtaining some sheep and coin, and with this inconsiderable booty, the buccaneers left the port of Guasco. The next landing which the buccaneers made was at the village of Wlo, on which, for a second time, they made a, descent. They took it this time without any opposition, for they fell upon it in the darkness of the night when the inhabitants were sleeping in fancied security in their beds. Before morning the people of Hilo found themselves pri- soners, and saw their little town ravaged before their eyes. The booty which the pirates obtained, was eighteen jars of wine, and a large quantity of figs, sugar, and molasses. The buccaneers, while at this place, made a visit to the sugar mill, which, as we mentioned in our last chapter, they had burnt in their former expedition, because the owner did not ransom it according to agreement. Here they were in- formed, much to their merriment, that the proprietor, since their departure, had brought a suit at law against the town of Hilo, alleging that it was not th e pirates, but the Spaniards who had destroyed his property, and that therefore the town must pay for it. A few days after this, and when off the Island of Plata, a fresh mutiny broke out among the buccaneers. The mutineers were the same ones, who, as we have mentioned in a former chapter, deposed Sharp 'and elected Watling as their leader. The party had always hated Sharp, had never been satisfied since the defeat at Arica, and had taken every means in their power to breed dissensions among their companions, endeavoring to persuade them to abandon Sharp, and 5     vv        MORGTAN, THE BUCCANEER. return across the Isthmus to the rendezvous at Golden Island, as their late ill success was enough to show them that nothing further could be gained in the South Seas. The murmurings and threats of the muti- neers arose to such a height, that Sharp, findingg he had no power to awe them into subjection, mustered all hands together, proposed that they should take a vote, and that the party who had the majority should keep the ship, while the minority should leave and go where they pleased. The vote was taken, and Sharp's friends proved the most numerous. The mutineers, therefore, as had been agreed, left the ship in the long boat and canoes, directing their course towards the Gulf of San Miguel, with the intention of landing there, and proceed- ing across the Isthmus by the way they came. Meanwhile, Sharp, with a crew of about seventy men, continued the cruise of the South Seas northward to the Gulf of Nicoyra.  After cruising about this gulf and that of Dulce, for about a month, without meeting with any 'adventure of consequence, the buccaneers returned again towards the island of Plata. They had hardly changed their course when they fell in with a ship named the San Pedro, which they took after a short resistance. She proved to be richly laden, hav- ing on board twenty-one thousand pieces of eight in chests, and sixteen thousand more in bag.    The buccaneers having taken the money from. their prize, cut down her mainlnast, and then cast lher adrift with all her crew and passengers. A division of the money in the bags, to- gether with other spoil, was then made, and each man received two hundred and thirty-four pieces of eight. The twenty.one thousand pieces contained in the chests were reserved for distribution at a future period. The capture of the San Pedro seemed now but the beginning of sue. cess. A few days afterwards they had the good fortune to meet a packet bark bound from Panamato Lima, which fell an easy prey ir- their hands. From those on board, they learned that it was the gen. eral impression at Panama that the buccaneers had left the South Seas and returned overland to the West Indies. This was the reason why the packet had ventured out, as it was supposed that the way was free from all danger. The buccaneers were rejoiced at this news, as it gave to them the hope that other vessels were also riding the surrounding waters in thesame careless security, and would soon come within their grasp. Elated, therefore, with their success, and animated with the prospect of more, the pirates having,.as in the case of their former prize, disabled the packet and turned her adrift with her passengers gave themselves up to revelry, or, as one-of their number, who has left behind him an account of their adventures, says, "We stood out to sea all night long, most of our men being fuddled." The next morning, the weather being very close, the buccaneers were awakened by the alarm that a large ship was bearing down under their lee. There was magic power enough in this alarm to dispel at once the fames of wine from the brains of these savage men, and rouse them up to action, As the strange .sail came closer and closer, loom. ing through the mist like a large man of war, the voice of Sharp was heard, cool and collected on his deck; giving his orders to his men, who   MORGAN, TSHE BUCCANEER.         67 stood ready to follow him to death, and to fight the foe, no matter how unequal the odds. The buccaneers did pot remain long in doubt as to the character of their enemy. She was a merchantman of the largest size, and as she approached she fired three or four guns into the pirates, thinking to frighten them into flight or submission. The buccaneers did not return the fire until the sides of the two vessels raked each other, when they poured into their victims a brisk and deadly volley of small arms, which mowed them down like grass be- fore the scythe. A moment more, and Sharp and his men. boarded the vessel, cutting down with their hangers all who opposed their pro- gress; The very first blow which Sharp had dealt as he passed from one ship to the other, had cleft the skull of Don lDiego Lopez, the cap- tain of the merchantman, and stretched him a lifeless corpse on his own deck. The rest of the ill-fated beings soon cried for quarter, and 'as the pirates paused in their work of blood to'grant it, a woman of commanding form and feature, rushed with fiantic steps from the cabina and stood upon the deck. She cast a wild look at the fierce coun. tenances around her, then on the bloody forms which lay at her feet, until her eye rested on the body of Don Lopez. With a piercing shriek she threw herself upon it, pressed the bloody lips to hers; and wiped the gory brow with the long and disordered tresses of her hair. She was the wife of Don Lopez, and loved him with the deep and burning love peculiar to a Southern clime, and the torrent of her grief was now appalling to behold. The pirates, awed by her beauty, her grief and her lave, stirred not, but gazed as it were, spell-bound by the picture of female devotion before them. Suddenly, as if thf sense of her present situation had flashed across her like lightning, she snatched a dagger from the belt of her dead husband, and sprang to her feet. The steel glittered a moment in the light, and then, before Sharp, who rushed forward, could arrest her hand, it was buried to its hilt in her bosom. As the purple stream of her life gushed out from the wound, and she fell dead upon the deck, Sharp thrust his hanger with a quick and impulsive motion into its sheath, and turning to his companions, said in a subdued voice, "Men, no' more blood, no more blood; I know that in our eyes it is but as Water, but we have had enough to-day." The buccaneers appeared to share. the feelings' of their captain, for, telling the survivors on board the merchantman that their lives would be spared, they turned to examine their prize. 'The'ship which they had thus taken was named the El Santo Rosa- rio, or the Holy Rosary, and her cargo consisted of money, plate, and six hundred and twenty jars of wine and brandy. The buccaneers having taken all these out of the Rosario, turned her adrift, as they had their two former prizes, with all those whom they had taken pris- onerg on board of her. The next thing which the pirates did, was to divide the money obtained from the Rosario, which having been done, each pirate received ninety-four pieces of eight as his share. About ten days after this last adventure, the buccaneers arrived for the second time off the island of Plata, and there anchored. Sincethe taking of the Rosario, the pirates had, as usual on such occasions, kept up a constant carouse, and numerous quarrels had daily arisen from     68        MORGAN, THE BUCOCAiERa. the effects of inebriation. Amongst the rest, Ringrose, a buccaneer of some education, and who, after his return home, wrote a history of his: adventures, had a violent altercation with James Chappel, the quar- ter-master. Nothing but blood could appease them, and when they arrived at Plata, they determined to go on shore and have a regular duel. They did so; but wine was surer of its mark than valor, for ihen they arrived at the scene of, action, and braced themselves up for the contest, wine gave to them its double vision, fired for them the pistols of valor in a serpentin - direction, and with the explosion laid the combatants sprawling on the ground, not to die, but to roll over to each other, and make up their dispute,in the disgusting embrace of intoxication.  The buccaneers'remained at this island for several days, refitting their vessel, shooting wild goats, and drinking. On the evening of the'second day, while Sharp was pacing the deck of his ship, musing on! what course he should sail next, one of the negro slaves on board catiously approached and informed him that there was a plot among the other slaves, of whom there were about twenty, to murder' the whole buccaneer crew that night while they slept, and not to give any quarter. The slave further told him that the plotters were now get- ting themselves ready in another part of the ship, to carry out 'their treacherous design. Sharp immediately mustered those 'of his men who were sober, and before they were aware that they had even been suspected, the slaves were all caught and bound with the exception of one, who leaped overboard and swam for the shore. Sharp, calling the others to look on, pointed his pistol at the swimming negro and fired. A momentary splash in the water followed, and the trembling conspirators saw their comrade no more. Thinking he had terrified thet enough, Sharp soon afterwards ordered them to be unbound, and to return to their duty. CHAPTER XIV, Defat before Paita--The Duke of York Islands-Capture of a Cannibal- The Buccaneers double Cape Horn-Present to the Lady of the Governor of Antigua-&S- cond Expedition to the South Sea--Death of Captain Cook--An Indian Robinson Crusoe. ON the ninth day after leaving the island of Plate, the buccaneers approached the coast on which the town of Paita is situated, and an- eokred under a steep high rock, called Pena. Horaadada. Their hope and design were to make a descent on Paita unperceived by the inha- bitants. Accordingly they despatched two canoes, well armed and manned, on the expedition. The garrison of Paita, however, was prepared for them, and when the pirates in their canoes came in sight ofjte place, they beheld the hill which arose from behind and covered ,tthtpwn, crowded with soldies, while a strong breastwork in front, on tiese side, was equally well guarded. :The buccaneer were eoa-   MOGAN, TIlE BUCOANEER         69 vineed' at a glance that the chances of war were against them, and therefore turned in haste towards their ship. The Spaniards fired on them from the hill and breastwork, but the shot lell harmless in the water far behind the pirates, who succeeded in reaching their ship insafety. It was well for the buccancers that their enemies thus early  showed themselves in their full strength, for had they not done so, but kept themselves concealed in their fortifications, the pirates, with that recklessness peculiar to them, would have landed, and consequently would have been cut to pieces, for the Spaniards were six hundred, strong, and well supplied with arms and ammunitiol. The buccaneers now beat along the coast southward towards the Straits of Magellan, intending to return home by that route. Violent storms now met them on their way, their ship, damaged and shattered, struggled with difficulty through the raging waters, and the prospect of a watery grave filled the souls of the buccaneers with terror. To add to their dark forebodings, one of their number, amid the howling of the gale, fell from' the topsail into the sea, and it appeared tothe pirates, as if Heaven had sent all the demons of the elements to stop their further progress. But even in the violence of the tempest came their preservation. Driven on the coast with a force that threatened instant destruction, they suddenly found themselves among a number of small islands, through which, steering with safety by chance alone, they were soon on the bosom of a broad and sheltered bay, completely land-locked from the dangers of the sea. The budcaneers remained about these islands for some time shooting and fishing, and endeavoring to find the Indians, whose tracks they plainly perceived in the sand. One day while the pirates were out in one of their canoes on an expedition of this kind, they. met with a doree or Indian boat, sharp at both ends, and flat-bottomed, in which were three Indians, a man, woman and boy. There was a fire in the middle of the doree, apparently for the purpose of cooking. As the buccaneers came suddenly upon them, the man and woman jumped overboard- and made for the shore. The pirates, with that reckless indifference to humnan blood, so peculiar to them, fired upon the poor wretches, as with hasty strokes they swam to make their escape, The man was killed, but the woman, more fortunate, reached the shore in safety, and was soon lost in the darkness of the woods. The boy who remained in the boat wAs taken after a stout resistance on his part, he fought like a young tiger, and it was only by three of the pirates throwing themselves upon him at once and bearing him down, that he was at length mastered. When captured and brought on board of the ship, he became a curiosity for the buccaneers to contemplate with wonder. He wore no clothing but a seal skin around his middle, his eyes were squinted, and his whole bearing was that of a wild man. The pirates gave him some muscles six and a half inches long, which' they could hardly open with their knives, Nat he tore them apart with his fingers and devoured them like a wlMd beast. The buccaneers were under the impression that he belonged to a tribe of cannibals, inhabiting some of the islands around them, but who had fled upon  their approach. They gave him the name of Orson, and retained him     70        MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER. as a prisoner. Giving the islands, among which they had anchored the name of the Duke of York Islands, they again set sail on a south- ern course. The navigation of tie buccaneers after this period, was like that of men in the dadrk. They found not the Straits of Magellan, for which they were in scarch, but like wanderers in an unknown country, they were tossed hither and thther on the waste of waters, until finally -amid storms and tempest, they doubled the famous Cape Horn, and in about three montlhs from their leaving the Duke of York Island, came in sight of Barbadoes. They concluded not to land at this island for fear of being seized by a 1British manl-of-war which then rode at anchor in that port. They therefore directed their cruise to Antigua. In the mean time, quite a ceremony took place on the deck of the buccaneer ship. The pirates in their best trim assemblle together and addressed a complimentary speech to Captain Sharp, for the fearless maneor in which he had led them through many dangers, and the impartiality which had marked all his intercourse with them; They then, as tes- timony of their good feeling, presented to him a mulatto boy, whom they had taken some time since in one of their excursions, and who was remarkable for his intelligence and good behavior, This being done, a division of the undivided booty remaining on hand was made, and each man's share amounted to three hundred and twenty-eight pieces of eight. The buccaneers a few days after this arrived at Antigua, but when as usual they sent a rich present of jewels and gold to the governor's lady, and asked leave to enter the harbor, the governor flatly denied the request. This was what the buccaneersdid not expect. From the first of their piratical expeditions, they had been in the habit of bribing all the governors of Jamaica, Antigua, and the- other islands, and had enjoyed thereby a perfect immunity for their crimres, but it so happened that Colonel Codrington, the then governor of Antigua. was an honest man, and notwithstanding the influence of his wife, and many of the gentry of the island, who were in favor of the buccarneers, he informed them that they could not land. Notwithstanding the refusal, the buccaneers here dispersed. The ship was given up to a few of the company who had lost their money by gaming, and who were now willing to continue in the work of plutider in order that they might retrieve themselves. Sharp and some others landed at Nevis, and from thence took passage to England, the rest made their way by stealth into Antigua, and thence to Ja. maica. Some of those who arrived at Jamaica were arrested and hung, while others escaped for want of witnesses. Sharp, on his arri- val in Englan'd, was arraigned with a few of his men before the Court of Admiralty, and charged with piracies on the high seas. The spe.  cifie act alleged against Sharp was the taking the ship Rosario and killing the captain. But k. proved that the Spaniards tired first, and that all he did was in selfdefence. Thus ended the first expedition of the buccaneers to the South Seas. It had been successful and many of them returned to their homes, atden with their ill-gotten wealth. Although crime had marked the   MORGAN, THE BUCOANEER.         71 pathway of the buccaneers, yet even out of their evil much good arose  to the world. Many discoveries were made by them, and to them the world was indebted for a large stock of information relating to parts unknown. After their departure from the South Seas the Spaniards indulged for a short time the hope that they would have remained un- molested, but not a year passed over, before they heard that the ma- rauders were on their way again to ravage and destroy. And so it was. Captain Cook, who, our readers will recollect, left Captain Sharp in the South Seas and returned across the Isthmus with a considerable party, now started from Virginia in the ship called Revenge and mounting eighty guns. Cook soon fell in with another buccaneer ship which had been fitted out in London, and was commanded by one -John Eaton. The two cpmmanders agreed to keep company together, and the first adventure of any importance which they met with, occur. red on their landing at the island of Juan Fernandez. The buccaneers, while at the island of Juan. Fernandez, during their first expedition to the South Seas, had been suddenly frightened from thence by the appearance of three Spanish ships of war, and in the hurry of reaching their own vessels, had left on the island a Mosquito Indian, who was of their number, and to whom they had given the name of William. The circumstance had happened under the com- mand of Watling, and as many of the' buccaneers now on this second expedition had been present on that occasion, their anxiety and curio- sity as they drew near to the island, to see whether William still lived, was very great. This anxiety was displayed in a great degree by another Mosquito Indian named Robin, who had been with Sharp and Watling, and who was now one of Cook's company. Half frantic with excitement, he was the first to leap into the boat, which was dis- patched to the island, and the first to leap on the shore when her keel grazed the beach. William was there to receive them. Robin, ac- cording to the Custom of his country, ran towards William, fell flat on his face before him, and was by him lifted from the ground. Then William in his turn fell on his face, and was raised by Robin. This ceremony over, William, with every demonstration of joy, greeted the b rest of the buccaneers, and led them to his hut. It was a most primi- tive dwelling, built with stakes and earth, under the shelter of a pro- jecting rock, which formed alike its back and roof. The inside was completely lined with goat-skins, and his bed was a platform of sticks, raised about four feet from the ground, and covered with goat-skins for his bedding. The same shaggy material composed all the dress of William--for the English clothes which he wore when the buccaneers had deserted him, had long since been worn to rags. The buccaneers found to their surprise, a feast ready spread for them. Three fine goats, cooked and dressed with cabbage, smoked in front of the hut, and gave to the buccaneers a savory invitation which they were not long in ac- cepting. When their hunger was appeased, William told them his story. During the three years which he had passed there, he had lived in complete solitude, and had at times suffered severely. When his friends had first sailed away, he had a musket, a small horn of pow-     72        MORtOA', THE ,BUCCANEER. der and shot, and a knife. The ammunition was soon expended, and his musket became of no use to him, unless he could transform it into a weapon of a different kind. I'is Indian sagacity did not leave him long at a loss. He notched his knife, and with it sawed the barrel of his gun into small pieces, with which he made harpoons, lances, hooks and a long knife. He accomplished this by heating the pieces in the fire, and ham- mering them out with stones. He made his fishing-lines with thongs of goat-skin, and by hunting and fishing he had lived. Seveal times the Spaniards, who had found out that he was on the island, had landed and endeavored to find and take him; but he being fearful if he fell into their hands, that they would kill him on account of his having been a companion of the buccaneers, had managed to elude pursuit. As he had been daily in the habit of watching the sea, he had seen the buccaneer ship approaching the island the day before, had recognized her to be English, and had therefore killed his goats, to be in readiness for his long-looked-for companions. The buccaneers remained at the island sixteen days, and then taking with them their faithful Indian, they again set sail. They continued their course northward until they reached Cape Blanco. While off this cape, captain Cook, their commander, who had for some time been sick, died, and they therefore camne to anchor, in order that they might bury him on the land. Having carried the body on shore, the men were engaged in digging the grave, when three Spanish Indians approached, demanded who they were, and by what right they were there. The buccaneers answered that they came from Lima, and were bound to Rio Lexa, but the captain of one of their ships having died, they had stopped to bury him. The pirates having finished their last duties to their commander, now turned on the Indians, whom by this time they had deceived into the belief that they were Spaniards and not English, and captured them without much difficulty. The sav- ages finding that concealment was of no use, confessed that they had been sent from Nicoya, a small mulatto town not far distant, to watch for the coming of the pirate ships. The Governor of Panama had heard that the buccaneers were on the coast, and among others, had sent a letter to the magistrates of Nicoya, to keep a strict look-out for the approach of the dreaded enemy. The Indians also informed the pirates that the inhabitants of the surrounding country were mostly engaged in agriculture, and that many of them had large plains or savannahs filled with fine cattle. This was acceptable news to the ma- rauders, and accordingly they forced their captives under pain of death to lead them to one of these places. Guided by their prisoners, the pirates had not proceeded more than two miles into the country, when they came to a plain, well stocked with cows and bulls, and hav- ing shot as many of them as they wished, they returned with the car. cases to their boats. An election was now held for a new chief, and the choice fell on Edward Davis, who had been the company's quarter- master and was much esteemed. The next landing of the buccaneers was at the island of Mangera, and from thence they passed over to the neighboring one of Amar   MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER.          73 palla. The two towns on these islands were inhabited by Indians,' and were tributary to the Governor of St. Michael's. The only white men among them, were two friars who officiated in their churches, and had immediate superintendence over them in all other things. There was but one Indian among them who could talk English, and he was a kind of secretary, who kept the accounts of both towns, with the Governor. The secretary hated the Spaniards, and when the bucca- neers approached the town of Amapalla, he collected all the popula- tion together, and told them that they need not fear-that the bucca- neers were enemies of the Spaniards, and came to hurt them, and not the Indians. His speech had the desired effect, and when Davis, with his men, ascended the steep hill which led to the town, the secretary, followed by the Indians, received him with a warm welcome. The friars then led the way to the church, which, on all great occasions, was made the place of ceremony, and where they now designed to en- tertain their guests with their native music and singing. Captain Da- vis designed, as soon as they had entered the church, to close the door' upon them, tell who he was, and make a. bargain with them before he set them free. But tdie eagerness of his men foiled the whole plan.- When all the Indians, with the exception of a few, had entered, some of the buccaneers rudely pushed the remaining ones into the door.' The alarm was immediately raised, and the savages came pouring out of the church, and fled with all their speed to the woods. One of the buccaneers inconsiderately fired and killed the secretary. The whole design of Davis to form a league with the Indians, being thus frus- trated, he returned )immediately to the ship, weighed anchor, and again stood on his course, with the hope of soon meeting with better fortune. We shall here leave, for the present, the English buccaneers, and in our next chapter, follow the fortunes of a large palty of French buc- caneers, who about this time sailed from France, aid who soon after- wards formed a junction with the English, in the S uth Seas.

ABOUT the period\of time, when the events recorded in our last chapter took place, and the English buccaneers there mentioned were for a second time ravaging the islands and towns of the South Seas, a French party of pirates, under one Captain Gronet, left the coast of St. Domingo, and steered for the Isthmus of Darien. The French force consisted of two hundred and eighty men, eighty of whom were Englishmen. It is needless for us to follow them in their passage            ,            .     74        MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER. across the Isthmus, as we have already in these pages made the same journey with the English buccaneers on their first expedition to the Pacific Ocean. Suffice it to say, that after about the same amount of hardships, varied with but little adventure, Captain Gronet and his companions arrived in due time at the Gulf of St. Michael. Here they embarked in twenty-eight canoes, and were soon on the bosom of the South Sea, anxso'ly looking for the English buccaneers under Davis whom they had heard were now in the neighborhood of the Island of Tobago. They did not wait long in suspense. On nearing the island last mentioned, they discovered the English fleet and hailed them Davis received Gronet cordially, and immediately gave to him a ship called the Saint Rose, which he (Davis) had lately taken as a prize. The buccaneers, French and English together, now numbered some six hundred men, and their fleet of ten ships were commanded as fol- lows;-The first, a frigate, carrying thirty-six guns, was commanded by Davis; the second, mounting sixteen guns, was under the command of Captain Swan; the remaining eight, being the merchant ships and barks which had been taken as prizes, and therefore had no guns, were under the charge of (ronet, Townley, Brandy, and Peter Harris. This last captain was a nephew to Peter Harris, who, our readers will recollect, was killed during the first expedition to the South Seas. h'e buccaneers now feeling themselves sufficiently strong for any enterprise, determined to cruise around the bay of Panama, where they now were, and wait for the arrival of the Spanish fleet from Lima. The fleet went once every year from Lima to Panama, carrying the king's treasure, which seldom amounted to less than 24,000,000 pieces  of eight. This treasure, on reaching Panama, was carried thence by land across the Isthmus to Portabel, where it was received by the Spanish Armada and taken to Spain. The expected fleet soon appeared to the view of the buccaneers, but it covered the waters with a more imposing array of strength than the pirates had anticipated. It consisted in all of fourteen sail, six of which were men-of-war, mounted collectively with 800 guns, and man- ned by some 2000 men. 'Ihe difference was fearfully in favor of the Spaniards, but the buccaneers resolved to make a trial before they let the prize escape their grasp. It was late in the afternoon when the en- gagement commenced, and after the exchange of a few shots by which the pirates were very much-damaged, the shadows of the night put an end to the contest. During the night the Spaniards, by shifting their lights, managed to deceive the pirates and cause them to, change their position. In the morning, therefore, when the buccaneers expected to find themselves to the windward of their enemies; they found that their foe had been too cunning, had got the weather gage of them and were bearing down upon theriffull sail. The consequence was, that the buccaneers thinking that discretion was the better part of valor, put out all their canvas and ran. The Spaniards followed, and gave them a regular chase during the whole of the day around the Bay of Panama. A few shots were exchanged on both sides during the race, but no damage, of any moment was done. The fact was, that the Spaniards did not care, even with all their strength, to come to close   MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER.         75 quarters, and the buccaneers made up their minds that the chances were against them. When night therefore came again, both parties were glad to rest, and in the morning the buccaneers saw with disap- pointment the Spanish fleet with its treasures disappearing from their sight, while, at the same time they were glad to escape, as well as they had done, the probable consequences of a further conflict. Several small enterprises for a few days now occupied the attention of the buccaneers. No plunder, except some provision, was obtained by these adventurers, and they were distinguished by a growing ill- will between the French and English pirates. This feeling was occa- sioned at first by the fact that the French captain, Gronet, had failed to come up with his ship and aid in the late attack on the Spanish fleet, as he should have done. For this failure Davis had called him toaccount, and he excused himself on the ground that his men would not let him come. Davis wishing to keep as numerous a force as pos- sible, forgave the act of insubordination at the time, but in the enter- prises referred to, finding, from the continued jealousies arising between the French and English, that it was impossible to conduct any und ertaking with success, concluded that the two should separate. Gronet and his company accordingly left Davis, and the two distinct parties of buccaneers now set out in different directions to plunder and destroy. Soon after the separation, Gronet with his men, numbering some three hundred, anchored at St. John's Island, where having left part of his force to careen the ship, he embarked with the remainder in his canoes to go on a foraging expedition to the main land. The party went on shore at first in the neighborhood of the town of St. Jago. Here they procured some provisions, which they sent back to their compastions at the island, and then continued on their way towards Panama. At the distance of about forty leagues from that city, they landed in the night, and after, wandering for some distance into the country, found themselves in front of a spacious house situated in the midst of a beautiful and fertile plantation. Lights were gleaming from the windows, and the sound of gay and lively music broke with in- spiring strains the stillness of the air. The pirates paused to listen ere they sprang upon their prey. In the meantime, within the dwelling all was mirth, joy, and conscious security. About fifty persons of both sexes were assembled to celebrate the marriage of the daughter of the owner of the plantation, to a young man of wealth and rank from the city of Panama. The priest had performed his part, had joined the pair together, and with his round face, rosy with wine and good nature, had been enjoying with the rest the bridal dance and feast. The hour had now come for the bridegroom and his bride to retire, and the good old priest had just raised the wine cup to his lips to give them his parting pledge, when a yell was heard from without, of which priest, groom, bride, and guests knew too well the meanlig. It. was the buccaneers' cry ere they swooped upon their victims, and that festive party, although they had not themselves until then heard it, had been so informed by report that they could not fail to recognize it. The red face of the priest blanched to a deadly white, as the wine!     76        misOGAN, THE BUCOAEJE R.  cup fell untasted from his lips, the young husband clasped his wife tightly to his breast with frantic tenderness, but before he or his uvn- armed companions, with the shrieking females around them, could're- cover sufficiently from their panic to determine what they should do, or which way they should turn, the rooms within were filled, and every door and window without was guarded by the pirates. Gronet him- t self was at the head of the band which rushed in with savage shouts upon the gay revellers. He was tall and spare in form, had a sallow; complexion with thin sharp features, and a pair of heavy bushy brows projecting over small, piercing, but deeply sunken eyes. AVhrice was his ruling trait, and while he cared not for human blood, he was al- ways cautious to see beforehand whether he could make the most by saving or shedding it. He saw at a glance how matters now stood, and at once restrained his men from committing any barbarities. His victims were powerless in his hands, and all he thought of was how he could turn them to the best advantage. One by one, beginning at the bridegroom, he examined them, and compelled each under the fear of death to tell his or her name and circumstances. This being done, he set his own amount of ransom on each, and then informed them that he and his men would finish the feast and dance until the break of' day, when he should take all on board of his canoes with the excep- tion of the priest, and carry them to the island of Ignuana not far dis- tant. He further told them that they must charge the priest with the task of getting their ransom money, and that he would wait at the island four days for his return, when if the money was not brought, he should give up the bride and all her female companions to his band, and cut the throats of the bridegroom and his friends. Having issued these orders to his trembling prisoners, Gronet, with a refinement of cruelty, then commanded the musicians to strike up again their notes, and compelling the bride'to be his partner in the dance, signed to his companions to follow his example among the other females. And now until the break of day, the buccaneers held high revelry in the place of their captives. They drank, danqpd, and sung, and while the priest, gaining courage, thundered upon them the anathemas of the church, they laughed in his face, and for every anathema made him dance a lively hornpipe. When the morning came, they despatched him on his mission, and after rifling the house, returned with their prisoners to the tanoes, and soon reached the island of Ignuana, where Gronet said he would await the ransom. Before the appointed time had elapsed, the priest returned with the required amount, and the newly married pair, the consumma- tion of wyhose nuptials had been thus rudely delayed, were made happy in their re-union, and with their bridal guests were set at liberty. The pirates divided'1,000 pieces of eight as the result of this wedding. Gronet now hastened back to the island of St. Johns, where he had left the rest of his company. From thence, with all his force, he sailed for the port of Ria Lexa. On arriving at that "place, he found it in ashes, and learnt that the English buccaneers, from whom he had separated, had been there before him, arid had not only burnt that town, but the neighboring one of Leon. We will here leave Captain   MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER         " Gronet, for the present, in order to enquire after the fortunes of Capt. Davis and his buccaneers up to this point, and thus we shall find how Ria Lexa and Leon'were ravaged and destroyed. When the French under Gronet separated from the English buccan- eers under Davis, the latter commander and his company steered for theisland of Quibo or Cabaya, where they anchored and spent some time in 'making a number of canoes which they needed for the purpose of navigating the small streams or rivers which often in their expedi- tions on the main-land, came in their way. This hatving been accom- plished, they again set sail, and passing the Gulf of Nicoya, soon came in range of a high hill on the shore called the Volcano Vejo, which is the sea-mark for the harbor of Ria Lexa. Here they anchored, and leaving their ships with a sufficient force to guard them, Capt. Davis with the remainder of his men, embarked in the canoes and made for the shore. About daybreak they reached the coast and entered a small creek which led to the town of Leon, which they designed to take. The noise of their oars alarmed some Indians who were on the watch, and who immediately ran forward to the town to give the alarm. The buccaneers landed as soon as they could, and leaving fifty-nine of their number to guard the canoes, the remainder, consisting of four hundred and seventy men, marched forward to the attack. The town of Leon. on which they now advanced, was situated about twenty miles from the head of the creek, but the way to it was smooth and easy, lying most- ly through broad savannahs, which offered no obstructions but the long and waving grass. The town itself is situated in a beautiful plain, beyond which rose the Volcano of Leon, and on which grow in l1sxu- rious profusion, every flower and fruit of the southern clines, Leon was, in fact, when the buccaneers visited it, called the paradise of the Indies. The houses were strong and well built, and most of them sur- rounded with the most enchanting gardens. In addition to three other large and costly churches, the Cathedral or head church of the Bishop- rick of that part of the country was there situated. By three o'clock in the afternoon, the main body of .the buccaneers entered the town of Leon, where they found the'Spaniards, to the number of some eight hundred, drawn up in the public square or pa- rade to receive them. A sharp engagement followed, but the pirates charged with such fury and determination, that their enemids soon took to flight, with the governor at their head, and the invaders remained master of the place. The Spaniards in their flight met two of the buccaneers, who had not yet entered the town, and who from fatigue had lagged behind them., One of these they took prisoner, but the other, an old man, with the true pirate spirit, determined not to be taken Although surrounded, and told that if he laid down his arms, quarter would be given to hin, he refused, boldly'blew out the brains of one of his assailants with his musket, and then bared his breast to th1kihots which were instantly poured into him from the muzzles of a dozen arquebuses. The Spaniards being now enraged, would also have shot ,down the other buccaneer, and had, indeed, levelled their weapons at -hiom when a mulatto woman who had followed in their train, rushed between him and his fo-e and begged his life. The Spaniards, amazed     R$b   ,    BMORGAN, THE BUCCANEER. at the occurrence, granted! her request. They took him before the Governor, and it there appeared, for he could talk Spanish very well, that he had been with the pirates in their first expedition to the South Seas, and while staying ono ne of the surrounding islands, had formed an intimacy with -this woman. Time'had not effaced his remembrance  from the mind of the faithful creature, and she had no sooner seen than she had recognized him, and thus by her interference saved his'  life. The Governor inquired into the number and situation of the buccaneer force which had just taken the city, and the old pirate answered him that there was one thousand in the city and- five hun- dred more in the canoes at the mouth of the creek. At this informa- tion, the Governor was startled, and continued his flight with a more rapid pace than before, halting not until he thought himself securely out of harm's way. 1 When he had reached what he thought a safe lo. cality, he sent a flag of truce into the city to the buccaneers, saying that he would ransom the town. The pirates sent back word that they required 20,000 pieces of eight and the freedom of their captured comr rade,'or they would raze tie city to the ground. Four or five days parsed, during which the buccaneers spent their time alternately in carousing and ravaging the town, but still no ran- som came; but on the fifth day their comrade was sent back to them, and he brought the information that the Spaniards intended to give no ransom, and had only been gaining time in order to get together a suf- ficient force to surprise and destroy their invaders. The buccaneers, enraged and disappointed, gathered together their plunder, which was by no meaw inconsiderable, and then setting fire to the city, turned their steps towards the neighboring town of Ria Lexa. This soon fell into their hands and shared the same fate. Gronet, as we have seen, soon followed the English to this latter place, and as he stood over the smouldering ashes, he cursed his brother pirates for getting the advantage of him, and then turned to his com- rades to consult what course they should next pursue. CHAPTER XVI. Attack on Pueblo Viego-lThe Buccaneer, awed by the Ceremonies of the GChurch-The dgfference between French and English, in committing Sacrilege-The Altar and lthe Trleasure-'- he Vicar-General's Letter, and his Messenger's Bath--Tramping a Gapr at Chiriquita-Re-union of the French and English ]uccaneers. IN our last chapter, we left the French buccaneers and their leader, Gronet, standing over the ruins of the town of Rit Lexa, and cursig the English pirates under Davis, for having preceded them in the plunder of that place. This indulgence, however; of a vain indigna- tion, soon gave place to action. From Ria Lexa they made a descent on Leon; but here also they met with no booty, and they returned to   ...... .....'      79 their ships, having obtained only a small quantity of sugar from a plantation which they came across, and ravaged on their wray. Gronet, now, after consultation with his company, resolved to attack the town of Pueblo Viego, which is situated a few leagues above that of Rio Lexa. For this purpose, he left his ship, embarked in his ca- noes, with a party of one hundred and fifty men. and after a day's sail and march, arrived at the town. The inhabitants had hardly heard of their coming, before the buccaneers were upon them. he women and most of the citizens immediatelv fled to the church, while a body of about one hundred horse, hastily assernbled in the public square of the town, and prepared to meet, as well as they could, the invaders. As the pirates advanced, the horsemen charged upon them bravely and well; but they chargced, as it were, against Ia wall of iron, wrhich seemed as if built on purpose to receive and hurl them back with a deadly re. bound. Buccaneer infantry was too impenetrable a phalanx for Span- ish cavalry to pierce, and the-raking fire of the former, Soon scattered in flight before it, the horse and rider of the latter. Having cleared the wJay of the horsemen, the pirates approached the doors of the church, with weapons raised to dash them in. . But no-such-force was necessary.  The portals opened of their own accord, at the first touch ofnthe sacrilegious hands and disclosed a scene for which these men of blood were altogether unprepared. They expected to have met with resistance, or to have heard the shrieks of their terrified victims beg ging for life; but that which they now saw and heard, was of a far dif- ferent character. The men, women, and  children of the town, who crowded in a  dense mass the body of the church, were low on their knees in adoration.  Before the high altar w hich blazed in the light of its waxen candles, stood the priest, arrayed in all the vestments of his office, and with the sacred Host elevated in his hands, while up from both priest and people, there rose and swelled through the vaulted arches, the solemn chaunt-of "Miserere, Domine," (Lord, have pity.). Gronet and his band were startled and awe-struck. Being themselves Roman Catholics, the forms of that cliurch were never without power over them; and the scene which now burst upon then, being so sudden fand so unexpected that they too, involuntarily sulk on their knees and crossed themselves with devotion. The chaunt soon ceased, and then the priest, who was a grey-haired old man, still holding the H Ost on high in one of hi s hands, stretched forth the other to the kneeling robbers, and with a voice in which neither the feebleness of age, nor the tremulousness of fear were apparent, he called uplon them to pause in their path of blood. He did not curse them, but implored them by the bo'dy of God, which he held in his hband, to commit no violence on either him, his people, or the sacred edifice in which they were; then descending from the altar, with calmness and dignity, he said to those  rond olme    m  C ho e n e my children, ar t and retired, followed by his flock, through the vestry of the church. The pirates offered no obstruction-spell-bound they continued on their knee s, crossing themselves, and not until Gronet, who was the first to recover himself! had called to them with an oath, did they spring to their feet. They would now have rushed out in pursuit of the fugitives; bht     80        MORGAN, THE BIUCCANEEI. Gronet commanded them to stop, saying, "No, we will have noblood. Like good Christians, we have said our prayers-let us obey the priest, and commit no violence; therefore, reverently search the church.- Money before blood, if possible." The order of the chief was obeyed, and it was curious to see the contrast presented by the French bucca- neers in their method of committing sacrilege, to the manner in which the English generally perpetrated a similar act. It had indeed been one of the causes of disagreement between the French and English pi- rates, that in robbing churches and cathedrals, the English paid no re- spect to religion; but destroyed the relics, defaced the altars, and tore down the pictures in the'most blasphemous manner. 'TheFrench, on the other hand, now, as on all other occasions, proceeded to the work of plunder, with the greatest reverence. When they removed a pic- ture or statue, in order to discover if there was a concealed door or passage behind, they crossed themselves devoutly, and replaced care- fully both picture and statue. When they removed the altar, to look beneath, they went through the same ceremony, and neither defaced nor destroyed it. In the present instance, the search was long and mi- nute-for Gronet was under the impression that be had this time, been rather too quick in his movements, to afford time for the priest or the inhabitants to remqve the treasure of the church. His supposition proved correct. In a cavity, under the altar, the consecrated vessels of gold and silver, with a large stum of money, were found concealed. Jt appeared as if both had been hastily thrown in, with the design of removing them afterwards, to a more secure place. Such was the fact. During the brief period that the buccaneers had been fighting the horsemen in the public square, the priest had thrown into tis cavity, through a secret door, the plate of the church, together with what mo- ney the people had brought with them, in theirflight from theirhouses, with the faint hope that it might escape the clutches of the pirates.- The hope proved vain; and the pirates, with plate and money, to the value of two thousand pieces of eight, left the church and sallied forth into the town, to commence another search, in which all crossing and reverence were dispensed with. They found every dwelling deserted; but in several of the houses, discovered jewels and money to a considerable amount. The pirates were much elated at their success in this enterprise, and returned to their ship loaded with plunder and heated with wine. A few days after this last expedition, and while the buccaneers were indulging in one of those carouses which invariably followed all successful adventures, a boat was observed to approach the ship, bear- ing a flag of truce. When hailed by the pirates, an answer was re-. turned that a Spanish officer, bearing a letter from the Vicar-General of the province, desired an audience with the buccaneer chief. The request was granted, and the officer having been received on board with much ceremony, delivered his message. The purport of the Vicar-General's message was, that peace had been declared between France and Spaint and that they had joined tp- gether, to-make war on the infidels. The Vicar-General, therefore, thought that the buccaneers should indulge in no further hoatilities,   MORGAN, THE BUCCANEERI.         81 and invited them, if they wished to go back to Europe, to accept of a passage in any of the ships of the king of Spain, then lying on the other side of the Isthmus, and which wereentirely at their service. Gronet, after reading the letter, purveyed the messenger a moment with his piercing and sunken eye, and then asked, if the Vicar-General of His Catholic Majesty supposed that he (Gronet) was fool enough to believe what was written in the letter, and thus fall into the trap of such a shallow artifice on the part of the Vicar-General, to get him and his company into His Catholic Majesty's power. The officer protested that the offer was made in good faith by the Vicar-General, but Gronet laughed scornfully in his face, and turning to his men, he said: "Let the Vicar-General's messenger have a taste of salt water, so that he can go back with the answer, that the buccaneers washed out of his mouth the lie which his master put in it, and that if the Vicar-General will come himself, they will but the lie in his throat with a piece of cold lead." The order was no sooner given than obeyed. The pirates were in just that state of excitement from thei-r carouse, that rendered the eXecution of the command an act of sport, in which they engaged with a savage delight. A dozen hands, at one moment, raised the -unlucky messenger from his feet, and the next, he described with astonishing velocity, a half circle through the air into the water. As he rose to the surface of the sea, by the side of his boat into which his companions succeeded in dragging him, the pirates hailed him with the mocking shout, "Long live the King of Spain," and did not cease the taunt until the Vicar-General's messenger was far beyond the reach of their voices. Gronet now set sail again for the island of St. John, where he soon arrived. From thence, with two hundred and thirty men, in eight canqes, he departed to attack the town of Chiriquita, on the main land, about twenty leagues distant. This town was beautifully situated on a broad and fertile plain, traversed by rivulets; and bounded by woods and thickets. The principal trade of the inhabitants was confined to tallow and leather, and the inducement which the buccaneers had for making a descent upon it, was the hope of procuring a supply of pro- visions, of which they stood in great need. It was daylight when the pirates arrived in sight of the town, and they therefore, as they had heard that there were six hundred soldiers in the place, concealed them- selves in the woods and thickets, until under the cover of darkness, they could make the attack with better advantage. Night came, and they advanced upon the town in silence. Not a sentinel opposed their entrance, and they even surrounded the guard-house, through the win- dows of which they saw soldiers at play, without any alarm having been given. The fact was, that there were but about two hundred soldiers in the place, part of whom were asleep, while. the rest, after quarrelling for some time, on the question of who should and who should not mount guard, had decided the matter by the whole of them sitting down to play cards, and dispensing with the guard altogether. Thus the buccaneers found them, when they rushed in upon them and trumped the game in a different way from what the players had look- ed' for, when they commenced it. The soldiers having been made 6     82  -      1MRGAN, THE BUCCANEEIc . prisoners, it was not long before the rest of the town was in the com. plete possession of the pirates, and when the morping dawned, every ouse had been rifled of everything in the shape of valuable booty which it contained, while many of the dwellings had been made the scene of lawless licentiousness, too',terrible and revolting to be either conceived or described. The next day, the pirates collecting together as much provision as they wanted, out of the abundance which the town contained, tfook their prisoners to a neighboring island, where, as was their custom, they gave notice that they would wait until a ransom was sent. They waited six days, when having-received five hundred pieces of eight, as the price of their captives, they set them fiee and returned'to their ships at St. John's island. Gronet now found himself obliged to abandon his ship for want of sails. Those which the vessel originally possessed when Davis had given her to Gronet, were completely worn out, and there was no nraterial at hand out of which others could be manufactured. It was, therefore, determined to build some pirogues, or large canoes. The buccaneers accordingly bent all their energies to the task, and at the end of two months, had built ten of these craft, with a species of tim. ber called the Mapou tree, which grew in great plenty on the island. With these ten pirogues, two large barks, a half galley, and ten small canoes, they left St. John's island, and after about twenty days coast- ing along the shore, reached the mouth of the river Pueblo Nueva. Here they discovered a small frigate, which they took to be that of their former English' companions under Davis. They accordinglv hailed it, but received forlan answer a volley of shot, which disabled a score of their men. The pirates, who had nothing but small arms, contented themselves with shooting down a few of the men on the deck and in the shrouds of the frigate, and then returning beyond the reach of the cannon. The enemy did not pursue them, and thus the fight, if fight it could be called, ended. We next find the buccaneers at the Bay of Caldaira, holding a council of war, to determine what their next enterprise should be. They had just returned from the town of Lesparso, which they had found abandoned by its inhabitants, and stripped of everything in the shape of plunder. It was now some months since they had made their successful attack on Viego, and the long interval which had elapsed, in which they had gained no plate or money, served more keenly to whet their desire up to the proper point of energy, necessary to enable them again to behold and grasp the glittering treasure. After mapy contending opinions had been expressed, the town of Granada was fixed upon as the next object of attack and plunder, and Gronet fur- ther issued orders that every one who should be guilty of cowardice, violence, disobedience, or drunkenness, should forfeit his share of the booty. A11 this having been agreed on, the pirates sailed from the bay of Caldairal and were astonished on the same day to descry at some distance in advance of them, a fleet of thirteen sail. They gave chase, and on coming up with the strangers, were no less surprised to find that they were a party of one hundred' and fifteen of their former   MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER.         88 English companions, who, under Captain Tounsley, had left Captain Davis on the coast of Acapulco, and were now cruising on their own account. Captain Tounsly informed Gronet, that Captain Davis was on the southern coast, and that Captain Sumas had left the South Seas and gone to the East Indies. The French buccaneers, being now the strongest, thought they would indulge themselves in a little revenge. They remembered the humili- ating manner in which the English had treated them, and now deter- mined to pay it back with interest. They boarded Tounsley's vessel, and took it away from him by force. Tounsley remonstrated, but Gronet poured forth on him the most bitter invectives, recounting the slights, insults, and humiliating treatment the French had received from the English, that the French were more honest than the English, and better men every way, and that they had now the power in their own hands and would use it. With such language, Gronet left' the English commander in no very enviable state of mind, and not a little frightened at the course his affairs were taking. In the evening, how- ever, the two chiefs had another interview, and Gronet, with a show of magnanimity, put an end to Torlnsley's doubts by telling him that the ship which had been taken from him a few hours before, was again at his service, that a small rebuke was all that was intended, and that now he whs at liberty to go where he pleased. Whether really touched with the Frenchman's generosity, or whether he deemed it policy, it is hard to determine; but certain it is, that Tounsley offered to join his force with that of Gronet, in all future enterprises. Gronet accepted the offer, and thus again united, both French and English turned their course towards the town of Granada. CHAPTER XVII.

THE French and English buccaneers, having formed once more a league of friendship, left their ships under covert of Cape Blanco, and departed in their'canoes and pirogues on an expedition to Granada. Having sailed about twenty leagues to the eastward of the cape, they landed on the coast, and after a march of three days and nights, ar- rived in sight of the place on which their designs were now fixed. Granada was a large arid spacious city, beautifully situated on the Lake of Nicaragua, and environed by a number of extensive sugar plantations whose mills and buildings dotted the landscape like so many clustering villages. The houses of the city were well built, and many of them were not wanting in architectural display. The Cathe.     84        MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER. dral, which faced on the place of arms or public square, was a stately edifice, grand and imposing in its outward appearance, while within, its altars and shrines blazed with jewels and ornaments of gold. There were several other and smaller churches, together with a large convent and monastery. A strong square fort, guarded by fourteen pieces of cannon, commanded the main entrance as well as three other principal avenues of the city which diverged from its sides. Such was Granada, before which the buccaneers now appeared. The governor of the city had some weeks previously heard of the pirates being on the coast, and had accordingly prepared to defend the place against the attack which he thought would probably be made upon it. He manned the Ifort with an additional number of soldiers, encompassed the public square with a strong wall or barricade, placed an ambush of about one hundred men in the suburbs of the city, and had two ships in readiness to carry the treasure of the town to an island some leagues distant in the lake of Nicaragua. Notwithstand- ing all these preparations, the hope was still indulged, both by the governor and inhabitants, that the pirates might possibly pass them by; and not until some fishermen brought the intelligence, that the. invader was at the door, did the people begin to strip the churches and their houses of all valuables and take them to the ships. In the mean time, the buccaneers advanced boldly on the city. The party which the governor had placed in ambush vainly endeavored to stop their progress. The pirates fell with fury on them, cut them to pieces, and marched triumphantly over their, dead bodies into the main avenue of the city, directly in front of the fort. The Spaniards seeing their ap- proach, opened their cannon upon them, expecting to have mown them down like grass, but the buccaneers fell to the ground while the shot passed harmlessly over them, and before another discharge could be made, they had gained an eminence which commanded the top of the fort, and from which they poured into the Spaniards such a deadly fire, that the latter were obliged to retreat to the cathedral. The buc- caneers then scaled the walls and took possession of the fort, having had but four men killed and eight wounded in the encounter. To surround the cathedral and call upon the Spaniards to surrender, was now but the work of a few mopents. At the call, the governor ap- peared at the church door, bearing a white flag in his hand, and march- ing out at the head of his soldiers into the'public square, gave himself and companions into the hands of the pirates. The prisoners were soon confined in the various houses around the square, while the buc- caneers then proceeded to search the town. -In the cathedral and churches they found nothing; all had been completely stripped. The houses also were bare of plunder, and not until the pirates had reached the convent on the very edge of the lake, did they perceive a solution of the mystery. The convent itself was deserted, and far out on the bosom of the lake two ships were sailing fast before a favorable wind, and were already beyond the reach of a gun. All was explained; the treasures of the churches and the houses, the inmates of the convent, and most of the principal inhabitants of the city were in the vessels, and the pirates could not follow, for every   MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER.         85 thing in the shape of a boat had been destroyed. Gronet and his companions ground their teeth in rage at the sight, and returned to the fort to wreak their vengeance on their prisoners. Gronet imme- diately ordered the governor into his presence and informed him of what he had seen, and asked if there was no money or treasure left behind. The governor answered that there was not; but Gronet with an oath told him that he lied, and that unless he produced a ransom for himself on the spot, or gave directions where it could be found or obtained, he should be tortured first and hung afterwards. The gov- ernor bowed his head in submission, and said that he had no ransom to produce at such short notice, neither did he know where any money or jewels were concealed or could be obtained. The fiend, however, was raised in the breast of the buccaneer chief, and with a savage laugh he ordered his men to give the governor a specimen of the pirate's rack. Two ropes having been procured and attached to the hands and feet oh the ill-fated victim, eight of the strongest buccaneers laid hold of them, four at each rope, and'pulled with all their might in contrary directions. The limbs of the wretched man were stretched in a moment to their utmost tension, and he screamed aloud in agony that if they would desist in their work of torture, he would comply with their desires. The governor was by no means a martyr, and the first pull had overcome his love of money. At a sign from Gronet he was unbound, and having recovered in some degree from the pain which he had suffered, signified that by following him the money would be forthcoming. The chief did not need a second invitation, but ordered the governor to lead the way at once. They had passed but into the next apartment of the fort, when the governor, pointing to a certain part of the wall, said that-if a few stones were displaced, there would be found teri thousand pieces of eight, which he had not' had time to send off in the ships, and but barely time to conceal before he had been driven by the pirates from the fort. The glittering trea- sure was soon laid bare to the sight by the eager hands of the bucca- neers, Gronet himself assisting in the work. The money having been secured, Gronet told the governor that he was free to go where he pleased, but that it would be as well to state that he (Gronet,) would stay in Granada for three' days longer, when, if a ransom was not sent for the town, he Would burn it and make such disposition of his prison- ers as at that time he should see fit. The governor departed in the direction of the town of Lesparso, and the buccaneers now gave them- selves up to feasting and drinking. The three days appointed for the payment of the ransom passed, and no ransom having come, Gronet ordered that the prisoners should be bound to the trees of a wood just beyond the city, and that the city itself should be fired. Both orders were obeyed to the letter, and thus the buccaneers left the city of Granada. They had not proceeded far on their return to their canoes, when they were surprised by an ambuscade of a thousand Spaniards, who started up from the woods and bushes around to give them battle, but the pirates had luckily brought with them one of the cannon of the city, and with it now soon dispersed their assailants. The next day     86        MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER. after this, as the buccaneers emerged from a forest into a broad plain7 they beheld on an eminence five hundred more Spaniards waiting their approach with a red banner in front of them to signify their intention that they should give no quarter. The pirates in answer also unfurled a red flag and advanced to the contest. The battle was of short duration. Muskets were thrown aside, and the fight was hand to, hand and steel to steel, and- no quarter given or asked on either side. The Spaniards, soon perceiving that they were getting the worst of it, turned in flight, leaving their weapons and horses in the hands of their conquerors. The next event of any importance, which occurred to the bucca- neers after regaining their ships at Cape Blanco, was a discussion that arose on the subject of the course they should next pursue. One party was for going to Panama, in hopes of meeting with some fleet in that region which might be carrying the government treasure; while another party thought that, owing to the excessive rains and southerly winds which would prevail there by the time they reached that region, it would therefore be advisable to go westward and winter on some island. There being no prospect of the two parties coming to an agreement, it was determined to settle it amicably. A division of the booty, and also of the barks and canoes, was accordingly made, and the French, under Gronet, to the number of about two hundred, sailed away in a westerly direction, while about the same number of French and English together laid their course, under the command of Captain Tounsley, towards Panama. We shall follow, for the present, the party com- manded by Tounsley. The first place at which they cast anchor was in the bay of Colebra, where they went on shore and obtained water and provisions. From thence they sailed for the bay of Villia, with the design of attacking a town of that name, which is situated about thirty leagues to the west- ward of Panama. In 'due time they arrived at the bay, and leaving a sufficient number to guard their ships, they landed with a force of one , hundred and sixty men, and marched directly for the town, where they arrived about half an hour after sunrise. The inhabitants had no notice of their approach, and in conscious security, were all at mass in the church. The, pirates, therefore, fell upon kneeling enemies, wito became an easy prey to their hands. There was no fighting or blood shed. Tounsley merely ordered the church doors to be closed on the prisoners, and then surrounding the church with a sufficient guard, he, with the balance of'his men, searched the town for plunder. The booty which fell into their hands, was by far the most valuable of any that they had as yet obtained in the South seas. It consisted of mer- chandise to the value of a million pieces of eight, together with fifteen thousand pieces of eight in silver. The most valuable of this plunder they put on board of the canoes, and sent it, with an escort of nine men, down the river of Villia, which is navigable for small barks up to within a very short distance of the town. This escort, while on its way to the mouth of the river, was surprised by a large body of Span- iards who had lain in wait for them. A short battle ensued, but the fortune of war, owing to their superiority of numbers, was on the side   MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER.         87 of the Spaniards, and the pirates lost their booty, and also two of their number, who were killed in the skirmish. The rest made their escape, while the Spaniards, after transfixing the heads of the two slain buc- caneers on poles, which they stuck in the middle of the river, retired again to the concealment of the bushes. Captain Tounsley, who soon after with the main body of the buccaneers, and the prison- ers which he had taken at the towni followed in the track of the escort, was filled with consternation when he beheld the poles and their ghastly burdens, but not until he arrived at the mouth of the river and met the survivors of the escort, did he learn the full extent of the'misfor- tune of his enterprise. No sooner was he informed of the, whole par- ticulars, than in retaliation, he ordered the heads of two of his prison- ers to be in like manner cut off and fixed on poles iii the river, and then having despatched a monk to theSpaniards, stating that he would wait two days for ten thousand pieces of eight, as a ransom for the remaining prisoners in his hands, before -he cut off all their heads, he returned with all his force to his shilp which he had left in the bay. The ransom was sent within the specified time, and the buccaneers again set sail towards Panama., Ten days afterward, having in the meantime captured a bark by which' they obtained the information that a ship laden with gold was on its rway to Panama, from the mines near Bocca Del Chica, they anchored among the King's islands to await the coming of the prize. On one of these islands they surprised the captain of a Greek pirogue, who, it seems, had come to the island, knowing that they were in the neighbor- hood, on purpose to be taken in order that he might lead them into a snare. His design was to lure'the pirates under the fort of Panama, and to this end, he told them that, a little frigate came every night laden into Panama, and that under cover of the night, they might easily take her. The buccaneers being greatly in need of more vessels than they had. and thinking the captain of the pirogue to be sincere in his information, resolved to take advantage of it. Accordingly, they departed one night for the port of Panama, in four canoes, the Greek captain acting as their guide. About two hours before daylight, their guide pqinted out a sail to them as the one of which he had told them. It happened, however, just at that moment, that another small bark, coming out of the port, passed within a short distance of the buccaneers. They immediately gave chase to this last one, and took her without exchanging a shot. By the captain of their prize, they were astonished to find that they had been deceived by their guide, and that he had been purposely sent out by the governor of Panama, under the promise of a large reward, if he succeeded in luring the buccaneers under the guns of the fort. The sail which he had pointed out to them as that of a ship, was no ship at all, but simply some planks fastened on firm land, within pistol shot of the shore, with a mast and sails fixed in the middle. Had not the other ship which they had taken, diverted the attention of the buccaneers, they would inevitably have run aground on this sham vessel of planks, and been blown to pieces by the guns of the fort. The buccaneers, on reaching their barks at King's Island, executed     88        IMORGAN, ITHE BUCCANEER. summary vengeance on their Greek informer. They first cut out his tongue, and after keeping him some hours in the agony of the pain which the operation occasioned, cast him into the sea. The buccaneers now sailed for the Island of TavogaL ICHAPTER   XVIII.

Buccaneers' Revenge--- Fate of the Spanish Maiden-the Burning Road. THE buccaneers soon anchored at the island of Tavoga. From this island they now cruised about in all directions, keeping watch of the Bay of Panama, in order to discover the Spanish treasure ships. None, however, came, and after ten days' anxious waiting, during which time they only captured a bark laden with provisions, the buccaneers weighed anchor from [Tavoga, and departed on an expedition against the new town of La Terrible. This town was situated on the river Boca del Chica, and was built as a sort of defence to a rich gold mine not far distant. It was midnight when the pirates, in their canoes, sailed up the river Boca del Chica, in order to surprise the town of La Terrible. They thought to have fallen upon it in--hedarkness, and to have taken, it without much trouble; but to their astonishment, they suddenly found themselves full in the blaze of a number of watch-fires, which had been kindled on the shore by the Spaniards, who were evidently waiting the approach of their enemy. It was too late for the pirates to retreat; the tide bore them into a bow of the river, directly in front of the en- trenchment of the Spaniards, and nothing was left for them but to fight, whatever might be the odds against them. The Spaniards immediate- ly poured a volley of shot into their canoes, but without doing much damage. Before they could fire again; the pirates landed, and after a hot contest of about an hour, they drove the Spaniards from their ground and took possession of the intrenchments. The town soon afterwards fell into their hands, and from the prisoners whom they took, they learned that a party of thirty-six buccaneers, who had been passing by this river to the North Sea, had been massacred by the Spanish soldiers whom the Governor of Panama had sent there for that purpose. The pirates found in the town a large quantity of gold dust, which having secured, they set fire to the place, and then hast- ened on their return to Tavoga. As they approached the island, they descried three ships bearing down upon them. The buccaneers immediately cleared heir decks for action, and it was not long before the battle was at its height. The two largest of the Spanish ships were soon boarded and taken by the   MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER.         89 pirates, while the remaining one, which was a small galley, in her haste to escape by flight, ran herself ashore and was broken to pieces, most of her crew perishing in the water. The combat, which was a severe one, lasted all the day, and when the buccaneers anchored at -night at Tavoga with their prizes, they found their loss to be five men killed and twenty wounded. Captain Tounsley was among the latter, and died before morning. His body was thrown into the sea with the usual ceremonies, and the pirates then turned to see what they could make out of the prisoners whom they had taken. They accordingly despatched one of these prisoners to the Governor of Panama with a letter, demanding that he should send some- medicine; provision, and five buccaneers whom he held as prisoners. The Governor, in his answer, declined to-comply with the demand, and used, in addition, a tone of defiance. The pirates, in answer to this, cut off the heads of twenty of their captives, and sent them in a canoe to the Governor, accompanied with the message, that unless the five buccaneers -were set at liberty and returned to their comrades within twenty-four hours, the heads of all the remaining Spaniards who were their prisoners, would pay the forfeit. The gory load of human heads 1ad the intended effect on the Governor, and twenty-four hours had not elapsed before he sent back the five freebooters who were his captives. The buccan- eers, however, had not yet done with him. They sent him twenty of tliose of their prisoners who were most wounded, and demanded twen- ty thousand pieces of eight within three days, as a ransom for the re- maining ones. The time having expired, and no ransom being forth- coming, the buccaneers sailed from Tavoga, and boldly entering the harbor of Panama, hung out their main flag and i fired a gun. The Spaniards answered by displaying a white flag from one of the bastions of the fort, and soon afterwards, a knight of Malta, bearing with him ten thousand pieces of eight, boarded the principal buccaneer ship, and offered the money as a ransom for the prisoners. The offer was ac- cepted and the transfer soon made. The buccaneers now left the neighborhood of the island of Tavoga, and the next cnterprise of any consequence in whichlt they were en- gaged, was the taking of the'town of Nicoya. Th'lre they obtained a considerable quantity of plate b'elonging to the governor of that place; also a large sum of money as a ransom for the town, which was sent a few days after the attack and capture. Vhile cruising around the' Gulf of Nicoyn, the buccaneers fell in again with their former French Captain, Gronet. He-had with him only tlree canoes and about sixty men, and he was looking about to find some favorable point at which to land and cross-ojer to the North Sea. Iis tale of adventure, since he had separated from his companions, was as follows: Soon after the separation at Cape Blanco, Gronet, with his force, made several descents on the coast, in the neighborhood of the bay of Napalla. These expeditions had been more or less successful until the last one, when, in a skirmish, one of the buccaneers, named Fouche, fell into the hands of the Spaniards. They took him to the town of Tinsigal, where, so far'from treating him with any degree of harshness, they heaped every kindness and attention upon him. Fouche had re-     90        MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER. ceived a wound in the affray, and immediately on the arrival of the Spaniards at Tinsigal, the commandant of the place had him carried to his own- house, where his wound was dressed, and an apartment as- signed to him. The Commandant's daughter, who was a beautiful young girl of some eighteen years old, nursed the invalid with the greatest care, and as the wound of the bullet healed in his flesh, the buccaneer found that a deeper wound, proceeding, from the two dark and flashing eyes which daily bent over him, was making its way into his heart. The commandant looked on, but appeared to see nothing, and the love of the pirate and the. Spanish maiden ripened fast into maturity. As the health of Fouche became day by day more estab- lished, his distaste for his former roving life increased; and influenced by gratitude to his captors, love for the maiden, and by the charms of the soft and luxurious climate in which he lived, he determined, instead of asking his liberty, to request the hand of the commandant's daugh- ter, and ask permission to pass the remainder of his life with tiose among whom the fortune of war had thrown. him. He did so, and this was exactly what the wily commandant wanted. He had treated the buccaneer with all this seeming show of friendship, in order that he might make him an instrument to entrap the rest of the pirates into his power, and he now unfolded his plans without hesitation. He in- formed Fouche that his daughter shoild be his on one condition, and: that was, that he (Fouche) should return to his companions on the plea of being exchanged for one of the Spanish prisoners on board the buc- caneer ship, that when there, he should inform his comrades that there was a rich gold mine near the town of Tinsigal, which could be easily taken by surprise, and that he would guide them to it. The command- ant, of course, would be at the mine with a party of soldiers, ready to fall upon and destroy the buccaneers. It may seem strange that even a buccaneer should listen to a piece of perfidy like this, for the rover of the South Sea, although seldom troubled with scruples when plunder was to be obtained, was generally governed in a high degree by that strange principle of honor which often binds the commonest thieves together. In this instance, how- ever, as in most others of the like kind, love came off the conqueror, and Fouche yielded. Whether the girl was a party to the plot cannot be determined; more than probable ahe was, and that which she at first commenced to do at the instance of her father, became an easy and serious task in its performance. She now pleaded so earnestly with her lover in tones whose sincerity could not be mistaken, that all scruples vanished before her charms, and he departed on his mission of treachery. A guard accompanied him to the sea shore, from whence, having displayed a flag of truce, the party were admitted on Gronet's ship and the exchange duly made. For a week afterwards Fouche was silent, but at the expiration of that time, he commenced drawing golden visions of the mine beforel Gronet and urging him to the enterprise.  Gronet without suspicion consented, and in the darkness of the night the buccaneers landed on the coast, and led on by Fouche, commenced their march. For three nights they continued on their course, resting '   MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER.         91 during the day, for fear, as Fouche told them, of being surprised. The true reason was to give the Spaniards time to have everything ready for their reception. -On the third night when within a short distance of the mine, Fouche, under pretence of reconnoitering, left the bucca- neers, and disappeared in the woods. He hastened immediately to the mine to give information that the pirates were approaching. He found the place deserted with the exception of some fifty soldiers and the commandant's daughter, who with terror told him that her father, fear-  ing that his force was not sufficient, had gone to a neighboring town for a reinforcement, not having expected the pirates until the follow- ing night. The cheek of Fouche blanched with terror, as the proba- ble results of his treachery now stared him in the face. There was no escape, his companions were coming, and even before -she, for whom he had sold himself, had finished her story, their footsteps were heard breaking their way through the forest. The fact was, that as soon as Fouche had left his comrades and plunged into the wood, a suspicion of his treachery flashed across the mind of Gronet, and he had followed as near in the track of the traitor as it was possible for him to do. Fortune had so ordered that he came with his force directly to -the mine, and before they were aware, the buccaneers stood face to face with their betrayer and the Spanish soldiers. The moon shone bright- ly and the whole scene was clearly revealed in its light. There stood Fouche wit] the arm of the trembling maiden around him, while the terrified soldiers fell on their knees and begged for mercy. The mus- kets of the pirates were levelled in an instant at the whole party, but Gronet commanded them to pause, saying, "The gold first, my men, and then revenge." His order was obeyed, and Fouche, the girl, and the soldiers having been properly secured, the mine was searched, and gold to the value of ten thousand pieces of eight found there n. At daylight, the buccaeers taking their treasure and prisoners with them, turned their faces towards their ships, elated not more with the success of the enterprise, than wth the thought'that the treachery of a companion, instead of delivering them to death, had brought them a rich harvest, of gold. They had not proceeded far on their return march, when a body of Spanish horsemen crossed their path. The enemy proved to be the commandant with the reinforcement which he had left the mine to procure. The two parties were about equally balanced as to the numbers, and the commandant. knowing the desper- ate character of the buccaneers, thought it prudent to make a bar- gain. He therefore proposed that if the pirates. would yield up their prisoners, he would give them a free passage to the ships. Gronet's only answer was to direct his men to charge, which they did with such fury that the Spaniards were soon put to flight, leaving their comr mandant a prisoner in the hands of the victorious buccaneers. Gronet's march to the coast was now uninterrupted, and with all his force he soon embarked in safety on board of his ship. The deck of that ship now became a scene of revenge, at the con- templation of which the blood thrills with horror. All the prisoners were brought forward. The soldiers were first thrown overboard, and the pirates amused themselves for awhile in shooting them as they     92        MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER. rose to the surface of the water. This terrible pastime over, Gronet turned to Fouche and the commandant, and asked them if they had any prayers to say, for their last hour had come. The wretched men knelt on the deck and mattered p; hasty prayer, when having crossed themselves they signified that they were ready. Gronet regarded them a moment with a fiendish expression, and then with an oath cried, out to them, "Look, traitor, and dog of a Spaniard, before ye are thrown into the sea, at the freebooter's revenge ;" then roughly catching hold of the girl, he pushed or rather threw her among the crowd of pirates around him, saying ," Take her, use her as ye please, she is the pro. perty of the band." While the wretched victim shrieked with terror as the men of rapine fought around her to decide whose prize she should be, Fouche and the commandant, bound together, were cast into the ocean, and the despairing cries of the mistress and the daughter were the last sounds that rung on the ears of the lover and the father as they sunk foreverlin the blue waters. A short time after this adventure, Gronet and his party made an attack on Pueblo Viego, and in returning from thence, were, surprised by an ambuscade which had been laid for them from which they did not escape without much hard fighting. SQme months afterward, a division arose among the party of Gronet, the consequence of which was, that a separation ensued, and Gronet, with about sixty men, as we have seen, steered his course towards Panama, and met with Tounsley's party, as above stated. Gronet and his force, and the buccaneers who had been under Tounsley, now joined together, and made a third visit to the town of  Ticoya. After rifling the town, they gave themselves up to revelry. It was a long time since they had a regular carouse, and the place beingoa pleasant one, thev tarried there for some weeks, during which the bowl, the song, the obscene jest, and rioting of every description, reigned triumphant. Here it. was, that they set at liberty the com- mandant's daughter, who had for a long time been the victim of the licentiousness of the pirates. The despoiled and ravished maiden wqs found dead on the steps of the altar of one of the, churches, when on the morning ,of their departure, the pirates came to set it off fire, to- gether with the other ibuildings of the toww, and Nicoya in flames now formed the funeral pile of the hapless Spanish maiden. It seemed, however, that she was in some measure avenged on her retiring mur- derers. Many parts of the road by which they returned to their ships, lay through paths covered with high grass, and lined on either side, as with a wall, by the trees of the forest. These the Spaniards set on fire, and with the loss of about twenty of their force, who perished in the flames, and much suffering on the part of the remainder, the pirates, weary, scorched, and burned, reached the coast, and once more em- barked on board of their ships.

Queaquilla, situated on the river of the same name, was one of the most important commercial places on the coast, and was distant about eighty leagues from the city of Quito. Its chief commodity was cocoa, fromnrvhich large quantities of chocolate were annually made for ex- portation. The streets were broad and straight, the churches and con- vents numerous and rich in plate and jewels. The houses were gene- rally built of boards and founded on piles as a security, against the in- undating rains, which from the beginning of January until the end of April swept the country as with a flood. The whole town, on the river side, was encompassed with a high and thick wall, while from behind it, there rose a tall mountain, on which were situated three strong for ts, well supplied with cannon and guarded with soldiers. Such was Queaquilla, against which the pirates now advanced. The buccaneers, after rowing about two leagues from-the island of La Puna, entered the mouth of the river Queaquilla, and being borne along swiftly by the current, landed about two hours before daylight within cannon shot of the town. They intended to have marched directly upon it, and taken it by surprise, but were defeated in this by an act of carelessness on the part of one of their number, who had been left with some others to guard the canoes, and who rashy struck fire to light his pipe. A Spanish sentinel on duty observed it, and gave the alarm to the fort by firing his arquebuse. The buccaneers were therefore obliged to seek a covert, until the light of day should better enable them to combat the resistance which the alarm had so inoppor- tunely awakened against them. In the mean time, within the town, all was commotion. The inha bitants of Queaquila had expected no such attack, and as they knew that their enemy could be no other but the dreaded marauder of the South Seas, they were filled with consternation. Lights soon gleamed through every street, the bells of the churches and convents rang out the peal of alarm, the cannon thundered from the fort, and on every hand were heard the cries of fear, mingled with the roar of artillery, the tramp of soldiers, and the din of the preparations for defence The governori intrenched with his family in the principal fort on the summit of the hill, issued his orders with calmness and courage, and     "        MORGAN, THE B'UCCANEER. awaited the expected onset with a determination to defend the town to the last. The discharge of cannon from the fort was kept up inces- santly, and directed to every point around the town; for, although the enemy was at their gates, he did not yet appear, and they knew not from what quarter to expect his approach. Thus the moments, fraught with anxiety and fear to the people and garrison of Queaquilla, passed on until morning. At the break of day, the buccaneers, leaving their covert with colors flying and drums beating, advanced on the town. A sharp fire was immediately opened upon them from the fort and the' walls, but they did not falter. Gronet commanded the main body, and led the attack on the front of the town, while two other divisions, commanded re- snectively by Captain Picard and Captain George Hewett, an English- man, charged on either side. With one of their savage yells, the par- ties rushed together to the very foot of the wallswwith very little loss; for the shot which were directed against them passed over their heads into the river. The Spaniards, as if to put an end to the contest, now sallied out to the number of seven hundred, and engaged the pirates hand to hand. The battle was of short duration, for the buccaneers cut them down with their hangers like grass, and hewed their way through their bodies and over the walls into the very heart of the town. The public, square now became the scene of a terrific bloody strife. Here again the buccaneers were victorious, and in a few mo- ments thereafter, with the cost of but nine men killed and twelve wounded, they were in possession of all the forts, and the doom of Queaquilla was sealed. Many of the inhabitants escaped by flight, but seven hundred of both sexes, including the governor and the vicar- general, were taken prisoners. After these had been securedi and the fort and town duly guarded against surprise, the work of pillage com- menced. The place yielded a rich harvest of plunder. Large quan- tities of merchandise of every description, plate, jewels, and' seventy- two thousand pieces of eight in money fell into the hands of the plun- derers. Among the wounded in the attack on Queaquilla, was the French Captain Gronet. At firsthis life was not considered in danger. He had indeed fought after the ball had entered his flesh, and did not fall until he had led his party triumphantly across the threshold of the last and principal fort. Towards evening, however, when the town had been pretty well searched, he began' to fail from the effects of an inter- nal bleeding, and it became evident that his last hour had come. Even in death the passion which had ruled him through life gleamed forth with a more intense glow, like the expiring flash of an ember before it sinks in darkness. As the parties who had 'been sent to pil- lage the town returned one by one, laden with the plate, the jewels and the money, which they brought to the apartment where he lay writhing in agony, his eye lighted with an avaricious joy as he gazed upon it, and when at length the shades of night settled over the scene of blood and carnage, and the whole result of the enterprise was an- nounced to him, he raised himself up from his bed and yelled with a voice as strong as if he was giving forth his battle cry at the head of   MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER..         95 his men, "Bring forth the governor and let me see how much ransom he will give for himself and his town-how much gold, gold, gold, gold!"The governor, a venerable man, of commanding appearance, soon stood in the presence of the pirate chief. "Gold, gold, " shouted Gronet, as he turned a wild look on the prisoner, "or you die, you and your family. I'll cut off the heads of every monk and priest in- drag every nun from the convents and have them rav-;" a gush of lood from his mouth here choked his utterance, and the pirate chief fell back O6n his bed a corpse. The buccaneers who stood around were appalled by the sight, and conducting the governor back to his prison, there was, strange to say in the history of buccaneer adventure, quiet and- stillness that night in a town which had, during the day,-been successfully attacked and plundered. In the morning, Gronet was buried on the bank of the river, and the buccaneers then proceeded to arrange the terms of the ransom. The governor agreed to give one million- pieces of eight in gold, together with four hundred sacks of corn, and the vicar-general of Queaquilla was despatched to Quito to obtain it. The buccaneers, as usual o;n such occasions, now gave themselves up to plunder by day, and revelry by night. Not a hole or corner of the place was left unsearched by bands of these marauders, inflamed with wine, while almost every dwelling and convent became the scene of a lawless licentiousness, at the recital of which the blood runs cold with horror. While those females, for whose ransom little or nothing could be expected, were ruthlessly seized to minister to the passions of the pirates, those of any note or distinction were carefully secured, and, in a measure, respectfully treated. Among the latter kind was a young and pretty woman, the widow of the treasurer of the town. Her hus- band had been slain while defending the town, and one of the pirates, named Lusan, had found her concealed in her dwelling. While taking her to the fort where the other prisoners were confined, she turned to him, with tears in her eyes, and said, "Senor, for the love of God do not eat me." Lusan, who was a man of some refinement of feeling and considerable education, answered in a tone of gallantry, "I will devour you only with love, but why do you make this strange re- quest?"She then informed him that from the accounts which she and all the other women of the town had heard of the freebooters, they all supposed that the pirates were some inhuman monsters. The priests had told them so--had even told them that a buccaneer was not of human form, and would eat both women and children. Lusan soon quieted her fears on this subject, and from his kind and respectful treatment, won her good opinion. After remaining in the town four days, the Buccaneers, taking five hundred of the principal of their prisoners, among whom were the Governor and the widow above spoken of, returned to their ships at the island of La Puna, there to await the expected ransom. The island of La Puna was one of the most beautiful and enchanting in the South Seas, and it became now a sort of winter paradise for the buccaneers. Provisions wore 'daily brought to them from Queaquilla, and the pris- oners, both male and female, becoming familiar with their captors, con-     96         MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER. tributed no little to the general stock of amusement. The men' joined in the drinking, and the women in the dance, and the song and the lute of the captive, mingled with the wild shout of the pirate, were heard daily and nightly in the groves of La Puna and on the decks of the ships. Here occurred another interlude of love in buccaneer life, but dif- ferent in character from that which we recorded in out last chapter. The widow of the treasurer conceived a violent passion for Lusan, who had not ceased, from the time when she first fell into his hands, to pay her the most deferential attention. He had ministered to all her wants, and shielded her fromn many an insult at the hands of his less scrupu- lous companions. Still, Lusan was not in love with her. He had been touched with her youth and beauty, and had. taken her under his par- ticular care, because, with a throb of the better feelings of his nature, he had felt for her-felt how keen must be her suffering in her present situation. A few days since she was a woman of rank, surrounded by all the comforts of wealth, and receiving from all the profound respect and deference which both rank and wealth ever bring in their train. Now, she was the prisoner of a band of lawless rovers of the sea, de- prived of the -comforts of her home, and if not treated with violence, was continually shocked by the obscene sights and sounds around her; because this was so, Lusan, who, as we have said before, was a man of some education and refinement, pitied her; and because he pitied her, and showed this pity by acts, she loved him, and her love was the burning fiery love of the Spaniard. She told him that she loved him, begged him, when the ransom came, and .she was set at liberty, to go to Queaquilla and marry her. She would give to him all her estates, and she was very wealthy. She would procure for him her husband's office, for her. family influence was very powerful. All, in fact, that influence and wealth could procure, should be his, if he would only return her love, become her husband, and quit his roving life, to live with her the remainder of his days. Lusan was sorely puzzled. The bribe to matrimony was a tempting one. It was beauty, money, and a haven of luxurious ease in the breath of a luxurious clime, and free from the trials, dangers, and uncertainties of a pirate life. Lusan, as he thought of all this, felt like throwing himself into the arms of the widow and yielding at once as her prisoner; but the treachery of the Spaniards and their hatred of a buccaneer, rose up before his magina- tion, and he answered her proposal by stating his fears to her on this latter head. She assured irm impetuously, that there was no danger; that he would be safe WiNh hr, and to assure him, ran at once to the governor, and in a few /mo ents returned with a written guarantee. signed by that personage and also by several Spanish grandees, who were among the prisoners, that he (Lusan) would be respected and treated as one of their nation, if he saw fit to become the husband of the lady and live among them. It would seem that this last act of the enamored widow would have completely conquered the hesitating freebooter; but after thanking her again for her disinterested offer, he stated as another objection, that his own companions would not suffer such desertion on his part from their ranks. "Then fly with me, Se-   MORGANS, THE BUCCANEER.        97 nor, to some part of this island, where we can hide ourselves until they are gone, and then, Cara Senor, we will go to Queaquilla, and be haP- py, sad the dark-eyed and passionate pleader, looking up into his eyes with an imploring gaze, in which the tenderness and fre of ps- sipn were strangely blended. The order of nature was reversed--the woman had become the suitor, and the soul of the pirate was in an unkn6wn set without a compass, and he knew not for a moment which way to, steer; but it would seem that this undisguised exhibitioaiof truth and nature on the part of the lady soon found an answerin chord in the breast of Lusan, and called him to himself. He heita no longer to open the secrets of his breast with the same confidence that she had done hers. A vision of his distant home rose upin the mist before him, and turning to the fair pleader, he told her frankly, that there wan another in the land of his nativity to whom he was be- trothed, and he hoped yet, through all the dangers of his hazardous course of life, with wealth at his command, to tread again his native soil and wed the maiden of his choice. The Spanish widow made no answer, but as the buccaneer was assuring her, that he would rem0- ber her until his latest breath, she turned away from him and walked to another part of the ship, where her fellow-prisoners were assembled, and which was now to become the theatre of a far different scene than the one of love which we have just recorded. The time appointed for the ransom of the town of Queaquilla had long since passed, and on the day on which the incident we have just recorded took place, a: Spanish bark, bearing an officer from Quito, approached the principal buccaneer ship towards evening, and exhibi- ted a flag of truce. The officer was received on board, and he tated that he came from Quito with the message that the buccaneers must not be impatient on account of the ransom, for it would be forthcom- ing in a few days. The buccaneers did not receive the intelligence with any degree of favor; and George Hewett, who had been elected their chief since the death of Gronet, immediately ordered all the male prisoners on the after-deck, and handing them a dice-box and dice, commanded them to determine in that way what four of them should die, because death was now the portion of that number. It was at this moment that the widow, whose love Lusan had refused, came among the throng of her friends, who, ranged in a circle, were plaein the, fatal game of life and death. When told of the meaning ot the scene, she rushed in the midst and asked to be permitted to take her turn, but the horrid proposal was rejected, even by the pirated and she was removed to the cabin. In the meantime, the game of life ard death on the deck'of the buccaneer ship was played to the end, andthe gory heads of the losers were soon placed in the boat of the Spapisih offier, and despatched with him to Quito, with the message, that unless in four days the promised ransom came, another boat-load of fouri ua- dred and ninety-six, instead of four, similar presents would follow. 7     a8        MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER.

OUR aist chapter closed with the account of the buccaneers sehding to the Tenient of Queaquiilla four of their prisoners' heads, accompanied with the message, that unless the ransom of the town was forthcoming within four days, the heads of all the remaining captives would follow. No- sooner had the boat, bearing the messenger and his gory ciredei- tials, left the buccaneer fleet, than the pirates again gave themselves uap to their music, dancing and carousing, as if nothing unusual or un- pleasant had occurred. The four days passed, and no ransom came. But by this time, word was brought ,by a galley, which had been sent to Platta, that two' strange ships were lying! off the point of St. Helena. A canoe, well manned, Was immediately dispatched to reconnoitre. The canoe re- turned in a few days, with the intelligence that one of the vessels was'- the frigate of Captain Davis, who, hearing that Hewett and the French buccaneers were in that neighborhood, came to join them. The ship which' he had with him was a prize which he. had taken about fifty leagues to the eastward of Lima. Davis sent word by the 'canoe to the  buccaneers at Puna, that his frigate had been much damaged in the captuve of his prize, and that if they would send him a new mainmast, he-would; until it came, cruise without the bay, to prevent a surpsrise onfthe part of the Spaniards. He also transmitted by the canoe, the: followinig letter, which some of his men had taken at Paita fromt a courer, who was carrying it from Queaquilla to Lima. A Letter of, the Tenient of Queaqpilla, to the Viceroy of Lima. : Si-I- am to inform your excellency the second time, that the Ehg.  lishtand French buccaneers are still at Puna.

The Governor of Queaqilla was immediately brought before Hewett-the letter was read to him, and he was informed that he must take some   MORGANj THE 'BUCCANEER.         ' instant measures to counteract the plans of the Tenient, or the threat of beheading him and every other prisotier, would be carried into exe- cution. The governor, trembled-for, by the enraged countenances of the fierce desperadoes around him, he saw that they were in earnest, and that this time there would be no mercy. The governor was sadly perplexed for some moments, and he knew not how to act. A plan, however, at last suggested itself to him, and with some glimmerings of hope that it would be accepted, he laid it before the buccaneers. He proposed that a certain priest, 'whom he pointed out among the prison-  ers, should be despatched to Queaquilla, with full power from him, (the governor,) to act in opposition to the Tenient, to call the people together, in the great churc represent the case to them, and exhort them, if they cared any thin for the lives of their governor and'their fellow-townsmen, not to suffer the Tenient' any longer to keep those lives in jeopardy: The buccaneers, knowing the great influence of a priest, at once consented, and the holy father, whom the governor had chosen, was soon hoisted over the ship's side into a boat, with a parting admonition from the buccaneers, that unless he worked'faithfully in preaching to the living a Queaquilla, there would be a heavier piece of work for him to do in saying masses for the dead at Plna. The mission of the priest was in part effectual-for in a few days, a ba'rkrom Queaquilla, brought to the buccaneer fleet twenty-four sacks of meal, and. twenty thousand pieces of eight, in gold. The officer who accompanied the bark, informed the buccaneers that the people of Queaquilla desired three days longer for the payment of the balance' of the ransom, as theycould not in less time collect the money to- gether, The pirates consented to the delay, but threatened in case of fiailure, to make another attack on the town. and raze it to the ground. Two days passed, and word was then brought to the buccaneers that' but twenty-two thousand pieces of eight more would be paid, and'if that sum was not- received in lieu of the eighty thousand still due 'o6n the stipulated rahsom, that then the Tenient of Queaquilla would pur* sue the orders of the Viceroy of Lima, and not pay any. The Tenient ' also sent the message that he had five thousand men to aid him, and waited to see if the' buccaneers would put their threat of burning the town; into, execution. This bold comrrunication from the Tenient, threw the' pirates in a fever of rage. A consultation was immediately held, and 'the first pro- position, made, was to put off the heads of all the: prisoners; withbut a moment's delay. More prudent councils, however, soon prevaildd- Captain Hewett, and the French buccanee, Lusan, both addliessa their excited comrades, and insisted that they had better take whiit was offered, than run the risk of not getting any-that they had'shed enough blood to make'their name feared in those se as; that the' Spaniards were now undoubtedly in force to meet them' with somae chance of success, and therefore it was the part of prudence to icept the offer, give up the meanest of the prisones, reserving! those of quality, for a future advantage. The question was then put to votic antdthe advice of Hewett aid Lusan carriet the day. The budieeanehi accordingly returned answer to Queaquilla, that the offer was accepi*d,      O      X  MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER, d that they should expect the twenty-two thousand pieces of eight Pana, within two days. Having sent this message, the pirates, ;midng their present quarters nolonger safe from surprise on the part the Spaniards, weighed anchor from La Puna, taking with them fifty their chief prisoners, among whom were the governor and the widow the treasurer. The rest of the prisoners were left at the island, in arge of two canoes, which were ordered to give them up, on the pay-  ant of the twenty-two thousand pieces of eight, and to inform the ,arers of the money, that if the people of Queaquilla chose to send to e point of St. Helena, to which the pirates were going, the balance 'he ransom, as originally agreed on, that then they would see again eir governor and chief citizens-otherwise, they would behold them more. On the evening of the second day after this, and when the bucca- er fleet had made but eight leagues from the island, it was joined by v canoes, bringing with them the twenty-two thousand pieces of eight, Id now having nothing to detain them, the pirates crowded all 'sail- rteW point of St. Helena. When half way between this point and e isle of St. Care, they fell in with the frigate of Captain Davis, who raited their coming. The meeting between Davis and the French xccaneers, from whom he had now been separated some two years, as warm and cordial. Hewett had parted from Davis only a few oanths before, now resigned the command which had been given to im since the death of Gronet, and proposed that Davis should be ected in his place. The proposition was carried by acclamation, and aavis,was accordingly hailed as the commander of the fleet. After the confusion of the meeting and the election had somewhat 'blided, Davis informed the buccaneers that danger was at hand, in ie shape of two Spanish arthadillas, which were evidently waiting for xi buccaneers to come out of the bay of La Puna. Instant measures rt accordingly taken to meet the enemy. Eighty men were trans- rred from the French ships to the frigate of Captain Davis, who had oti men enough of his own to manage his guns, while all the other easels were put in the best fighting trim possible. These prepara- ions had hardly been concluded, when the armadillas hove in sight, nd bore down gallantly upon the buccaneer fleet. The pirates met hem with a round broadside, which somewhat checked their pro- ;reSd although not much damage was done. The action commenced ary in the morning, and continued until the darkness of night sepa- ate the combatants, with no advantage, and without much loss on Ai4er side. TD next day the battle was renewed, and continued until evening, rith little intermission, and- when again the darkness put an end to it, out two of the buccaneers had been killed, and several wounded, while the blood poured from the scupper holes of the Spaniards, who, with curses ou and deep, shouted as they withdrew from the fight, "A la maana la partida'"-that is," To-morrow, to it again." IThe morrow came, and with, the first light of its dawn, the cannon , oft tf .combataits thundered again across the waters, and the contest wa edi hiotter er tha eer. With a savage refinement in the art of war-   MOtoAfr, tHEI BUCCANOER.        101 fare, and in order to unnerve the arm of his enemy, Davis, this morn- ing, brought on deck the governor, the widow, of the treasurer, and the rest of the fifty prisoners -of quality,: and placed them full in view of the Spaniards. Lusan strongly protested against it, but without effect, and the ill-fated; band were doomed to stand, the horrified. spectators of the appallingsight around them, with the consciousness that they themselves were every moment in danger of falling, beneath the red hot shower of death which was pouring in fury upon them. Many did fall, and among the rest, the beautiful, but unfortunate widow, who, as we related in oum last chapter, with a strange iifatua- tion, had given her love to the pirate liusan, had not hesitated to de- clare it to him, and offer him her haind and fortune, buts whose'love, hand, and fortune, had by him been refused. Pale and mlotionles, like some statue of marble, she stood on that battle-deck, as the hoprs of the fight rolled on, and heeded not the'warm brains which often spattered her person, the pools of blood at her feet, or the roar of the cannon, mingled with the cries of the -combatants, which boomed and wailed around her like the voices of the demons of the air. The de- spair of love was in her soul, and death, even in his awful riot scene of war, had for her no terrors. The only sign of animation which she gave, was an occasional glance of anxiety which she cast oh Lusan, as, besmeared with smoke and powder;, he stood with flashing eyes, di- recting the movements of the gun under his charge. Tl4us she stood and looked, from the morning until noon, when one of the Spanisli armadillas, in endeavoring, without success, to board the buCcaneer frigate, had yet come near enough to discharge a, deadly volley of musketry on the 'deck. The widow received one of the faal siht in her breast, and with a shriek of agony, fell weltering in -her gore.- Lusan heard the shriek amid the roar of battle, and rushed to herb'as- sistance. He staunched the flowing blood-he bathed the' mrbiil brow; but it was of -n avail. Life quivered a moment in the lovet  form which he held in' his arims-her eyes were turned up to him witi - a look of gratitude, and then she, who had loved a pirate " not wisel  but too well," died with one convulsive throb, pillowed on a pirate's bosom, and amid all the horrors of pirate warfare.' The Spaniards saw from their vessel, this tragical issue of their last volley, and, as if shocked by the sight, immediately ceased firing. The buccaneers followed their example, and for a short space, there was a pause in the desperote conflict. Soon, however, it was commenced again, and continued in- til night. When the contending parties were separated by the dari' niess, the loss pon both sides was very severe; but neither had been able to board the other, nor gain anydecided advantage. The' buccaneers looked in vain the next morning fot the Spanish armadillas-they were not in sight. The Spaniards, weary with their three days' fighting, had withdrawn and left the buccaneers the con- querors. The pirates, now steered their course, towards Cape Paste, and having anchored between that point and Cape St. Francisco, landed all their surviving prisoners, and gave themr their liberty. Here, the booty which' had been taken at Queaquilla, as also the ransom money 6f the town, was divided. This over, the usual bucca- neer carouse followed.     2        MORGAN, THE BUCCANEER.

Dcpisforo  his cmpan- ions-Be sails for the Straits of Magellan-The rest of the Buccaneers arrive at the River of Emeralds-A Spanish jBobadil-The Indian Maiden--Attack on Tecoantepequa-A new enemy and a hasty retreat. THE revelry, in which we left the buccaneers at the end of oqr, last ipter, having been prolonged for some days, gave place at length to siness. All traces of the debauch which had followed the Siccess. expedition against Queaquilla soon disappeared, and the buccanuer et'was again ready to set sail. Previous,: however, to starting, a consultation was held on board ptain Davis' frigate, at which Davis declared his intention of again )arating from his companions, whom he had so lately rejoined. He signed, he said, to sail for the Straits of Magellan, in order to return that passage to the North Sea. He endeavored to persuade the role body of the English nnd French buccaneers to follow him, but e golden coast of South America still held its powerful sway over a ijority of the pirates, and with the exception of'but barely a suffi- int numbtrof English to man his frigate, they all turned a deaf ear hip proposal. The anchors, therefore, were weighed, a parting cheer Ls given, and while Davis turned his prow towards the south, the st of the buccaneer squadron bore to the east. We will follow the  ;ter, who immediately on their separation from Davis, again chose Lptain flewett for their chief.  The buccaneers under Hewett, after a sail of a few days, came to b'hr dne moonlight evening, a few leagues to the westward of Point angla, The canoes were immediately launched, and being manned th suffticient force, Hewett himself heading the expedition, were rected towards the shore. The party landed about midnight at the outh of a river called Emeralda. ThQebuccaneers advanced cautious- ' for the rays of the moon,fell full and broad on a small fortification fore them, and gave them reason to believe that there was an enemy hand to dispute their progress. As they approached, however, the ence of the night remained unbroken by any hostile demonstration am the fort, and they marched up to the very front of the place with- it meeting with any hindrance. A survey of the walls soon explained the mystery, for the solitary ntinel who mounted guard, was sleeping quietly against one of the rrets with his arquebuse by his side, and perfectly free, in the land of earns, from all fears of the terrible buccaneers. To scale the wall, which 'was low, and to gag the faithless watchman, as but the work of a moment fr the pirates, and was accomplished ithout much difficultJ. They then descended into the ourt yard of ie fobrtification with the same silence which they had hitherto pre- rrved, and surrounded a square stone building which stood in: the mitre, Without in the least alarmii/g the inmates. Leaving Hewett at :,         Buae           1    Oeta   -6gl r  STUEHrCoANEE.       its thi head of a few choseri men, on the point of entering the bildiig, we: will look on the scene within.'  i In at apartmen','tiie walis and floor of which were of bare stope, a party of about twenty Spanish soldiers were seated around a table of rough boards, deeply engaged in drinking and gambling. An Indian girl with form and feature as regular arid well rounded as if they has been chiselled by a sculptor, stood in one corner of the room, seemingly impassive to all 'around her. The fumes of wine had mounted high in the heads of all the revellers, and they had arrived at that pitch of ex- citement, when, whatever may be the real valor of the sdil, an extra. ordinary show of it is always sure to issue from the mouth. All were booting of the encounters' they had had with the buccaneers, 'and the captain of the party, a short fat man, 40 years of age, was particular ly loud in' the recital of his achievemenhts." "'Comrades," said 'he, "  was at the taking of Queaquilla, and ran this good sword of mine thoough the bodies of five of the English dogs. By'Sti: Simdi how they squirmed!'i and the valiant captain rung his glass on the table,. and looked around him with an air of bravado, as if the killing'of a buccaneer was to him a' mere nothing. '"Holy Mother, Captsin Pe-' dro," shouted a raw-boned, iron-featured soldier at the bottom of'the table, "I was at Queaquilla, too, and all the running you did was with those short legs of yours, which waddled you 'dbwn to the treasure ship in the river with a speed you never, equalled before or since. I was on board of the ship myself and saw you, and by St. Simon, as you say, how like a duck pursued by a hawk, you came rolling and flapping down the beach."' This sally was received with a loud 'shout of laughter by the rest of the soldiers, and it so' enraged the captain, that be drew his redoubtable sword and rushed with fury on the dting questioner of his courage, who stood ready to receive him. Before, however, a pass was made on either side, the Indian girl had laid her hand on the arm of the captain, and pointing to the door of the apartment, said slowly and expressively in the Spanish tongue, The Spaniard may prove his valor, for the English dogs are htere. As she spoke, Hewett, at the head of t'he buccaneers, stood at the en- trance, glaring in on the party, like a tiger ready to spring upon his pley. One look was enough for Capt Pedro and his men. Trembling with terror, they fell upon their knees, and begged for mercy, while the Indian alone maintained her position undaunted, 'standing atorni them like some statue of bronze of faultless proportions, silent and motionless. Hewett looked a moment with a curling lip on the kneel- ing soldiers, and'then ordered them to be bound, which having beet done, he then turned to the Indian and asked her why she didi n6t also bend and beg for her life. Elevating her form to its full height, she answered with a flashing eye. "The Indian comes of a race of kitgfi and fears not death. She loves the English, for they rob and kill the Spaniard, who has made her race his slaves, and whom she hates." The fearless bearing of the girl found an answer even in the breasts of her savage listeners. With the consent of his companions, Hewett told her that she was free to go where she pleased, and that her person should be held sacred from harm or violence at their hands. She,     1%MORGAN:, .Ta? ^F00^^ however, still remained in the room, to watch what would be the fate of her late masters. Her curiosity wasinot long ignstiSfied. Captain Pedro was soon submitted to a searchinig exainiatiaioni byewett, which ietfled in the information that h evth Iiai soldirs aid abeen placed there merely to watch the mouth of .the river, and give notice at Quito of the approach of the enemy that Quito was, not far distant, and that  the pirates could reach'it in their canoes in eight' hours. Pedro further aid, that they had no treasure either in the fort or neighborhood'. '4t this last item of information, the Indian, who had been listening at- tentively, exclaimed quickly, "The Spaniard lies. This river, the banks of which for hundreds of moons were the homes of my race, is calledily the Spaniard the river of Emeralds, because here he found this pJaMkling green gems with' which the raidens of the Sun decket themseives when they joined their warriors in the dance, or went up to the temple to worship the great God of the Sun. For these spark-. ling stones, the Spaniard has killed and' enslaved the' children of the Sun, and keeps his strong house by the clear waters of the river of Emeraldls. The tongue of the Indian maiden is not-a lie, let the Eng- lishman'look beneath his feet, and he will see." 'IBeWett did not need a plainer direction, but holding a gun to the heiiad'f Captain Pedro, comrmanded him to walk to tlheexact spot' of the floor under which the emeralds were buried, or his' brains would -oon spatter the walls of the apartment. The hero of, Queaquilla was iot long in putting his foot on a large flat stone in 'the centre'of the room, the removal of which, he gave Hewett to understand, would re- veal the treasure, It proved so, and emeralds to a considerable amount  in' vaue, together with five thousand pieces of eight were soon in the haids of the eager buccaneers.  It was now daylight, and the pirates held a consultation on the curse which it was best for them to pursue. An expedition to Quito wasn.,sinviting one, buqt it was abandoned.  Washing, however, to leave behind him a token that he had been in the; niighborhood, he ordered Captain Pedro and his soldiers to be hungfromn the walls of the fort; This order was no sooner uttered than it was obeyed by the willing hands'around him, and in a few. mo- ments twenty-one ghastly bodies dangled in the air. The Indian maiden looked, without moving a muscle of her face, on the whole of the awful operation, from the moment the ropes were tied around the ikecis. until the last convulsive struggle was over, and then, before the buccaneers could speak a single word to her, she had fled with the swiftness of a deer into the thick covert of the neighboring 'wood. The pirates now embarked in their canoes, and having reached their ships, again weighed anchor and set sail.  A few days afterwards they reached the port of Yatulco, but this peace offering no great prospect of much plunder, they sailed onward.   MORGAN, TRa BUMVANZE R        li : i  ."-- C: .

WHEN the buccaneers had advanced about eight leagues up the coast from Vatulcoo Captain Hewett, accompanied by two of the pirates, embarked in a canoe and steered for the shore. On reaching the main land, they found themselves at the mouth of a small river, where a party, of Indians were engaged in fishing. . The 'Indians leaped' from their canoes and swam for the share. More for the purpose of gaining information, than for any other reason, Hewett ordered one of his men to fire, if' he could, in such a manner as to disable one of the Indians in order that they might take him prisoner. The shot proved to be a lucky one, and one: of the unfortunate natives was pulled out of the water with a broken arm into the boat of the pirates.! By a little kindness on the part of his captors, he was at last induced to tell them that a few leagues up the river, was a small town which was situated in the vicinity of a rich gold mine, but which was strongly fortifed. The souls of the buccaneers bounded at this intelligence, and they im- mediately hastened back to the ship with the inspiring news. While: the pirates at the ship are launching their boats to depart on the expedition, we will take a look at the town itself, which was now about to become the object of attack. The place was smnall, consisting of but few houses, and one church. It nestled, as' it were, on the bank of the river, protected from behind by a high nountain, and in front by a strong intrenchment, built on a rock, which rose bold and abrupt from the bed of the river. A garrison of. soldicrs was always stationed at the place to guarld thetlreasure, wxlich fiol timel to time was col- lected there from a valuable wnine whichl was in the neighborhood. The inhabitants of the town weree mostly inatives, and miners. One man reigned supreme among thern, and le was Padre Antonie, the priest. Padre Antonie was a Jesuit, and owned the mine himself, or 'rather owned it for that powerful order, to whose service he had devoted his life. For forty years he had lived in that little town, had baptized, married, shrived, and buried the Indians and Spaniards, and had during all that time sent untold amounts of gold to the coffersiof his order. For forty years he had by mingled kindness and firmness, and by a strictness of life, unusual in the priests of that luxurious clime, so inspired his flock with reverence for his character, that they looked upon him in a light hardly less sacred than the saints whom they daily worshipped. Born of one of, the noblest families of Spain, he had early taken upon himself the vows of the church, had attached himself to the order of Jesus, and came out to the South Seas in the prime of his life. One of his first converts, an Indian, had told him the secret of this mine, and on the foundatioi of this discovery, the * 4     tl06        .O1UGAKN TH i BIU0CANEVBR. town of which he was the ruling spirit, had arisen. Although three score years of age, he was still hale and'vigorous, and as full of zeal for his church and order, as when in youth, fired with the example of his great master, Ignatius Loyola, he had left his native land to ex- tend in an unknown wilderness the triumphs of his faith. It was thehour of vespers, and the church was crowded with wor- 'shippers, for wil. i, Padre. Anthnie, arrayed' in vestments glittering with gold, was chaunting the appointed service. A cry was heard without, and at the same moment an Indian breathless' and fainting, rushed up the main aisle of the church, and fell on the steps of the altar, exclaiming, "Padre I The English dogs!-- The-English dogs .! ,The whole congregation sprung at once-to to heir feet with consternation, for they knew too well the meaning of thos6 terms. -Padre.; Antoine  was, alone and cool collected. He called upon them to stop, aiid raising the exhausted Indian, learned from him the startling:tale'thait he with four other Indians had been surprised by the pirates, : hiIle fishing at the mouth of the river, that one of their number had been taken prisoner and he with the others had escaped. Padre Antonie, although a priest, was no coward. and was as willing when necessity required, to fight as well as pray. He had often heard of the' bucca- neers, and knew that the treasure of his church was in danger, and he took his plans accordingly. Tellitig his affrighted hearers that there was no immediate danger, for that it would be some time before the enemy could reach the town, he commanded them to kneel and pray until his return. He then retired into the vestry of the church, from which he issued in a few' moments, clad from head to foot in a shining suit of armor. My children," said he, "this is a strange garb for a priest of God, but when sacrilegious and bloodthirsty robbers would despoil the altar; and murder its servants, the church authorizes the crucifix to: be changed for the sword. Let the women and children remain in;:the church, and let the men follow me." All was done as he directed, and before the dark shadows of the night settled around, the little town' was in as complete a state of defence as it was possible to put it. The Indians were scattered among the trees and bushes on the banks of the river, while the soldiers with the priest for their commander-in- chief, occupied the intrenchment on the rock. The watch-fires gleamg ed. across the waters for a mile down the river,'-and thus prepared, the warrior priest awaited with his little force, the coming of the invaders. In the meantime the buccaneers had left their ship and advanced slowly up the river. As the day began to'break, a shower of arrows frorm the shore gave them notice that they were discovered, and they hesitated what to do. It was a blind expedition in which they were noqw engaged. They knew not the strength of the town to which they were approaching, nor how it was situated, and they were for some time in doubt whether to advance or retreat. The neighborhood, how- ever, of a gold mine, had always more powerto lure a bueeanee'r, than 'thl terrors :of death had power to repeli: arid casting, therefore their livPer onthejhazard 'f ta die, they agtain set forward. A :party "were   MORGiA, THE BUCCANERB.         107 landed to scour the banks of the river on either side, while the main body, with Hewett at their head, advanced in the boats. The Indians on the shores of the river fled before the march of the pirates, and with the first, beams of the rising sun, the marauders were before the town. Thestillness of death reigned;in and around it, and the pirates on the shore, and in' the boats, paused a moment in their course. Their astonishment was increased to a still greater degree, when they beield- issue out on the summit of the rock of intrenchment a man of commanding-figure, clothed in shining armor, with a golden cross sus- pended'on .his breast, and bearing in' his hand a white flag. As he stepped ionr the platform of the rock; ehe removed his casque, and the climax was- put to .the buccaneers' astonishment, on their discovery ftom his shaven headi that he was a priest. "Men of rapine andlof blood," said Padre. Antonie, for it was:-he, "Forbear! ye see I am a servant of the altar, but have taken the sword to: defend my flock, and church. Depart in peace; I would not willingly draw the weapon of wari which I have buckled on." - "'Sir Priest," shouted Hewett, While orae of the French buccaneers fell to crossing themselves, ' away with your mummery; we have come for gold and not parley.. We would not harm you in cope and. stole on the steps of your altar, but in an intrenchment with breast plate, helmet and sword, we will fight you to ,the deathi unless you bring forth your gold." "Come on, then, and MnayGod defend us," shouted: in return the priest, as he vanished be- hind the intrenchment. - A stream of fire from the fortification followed his departure, and a ,yell of rage burst from the buccaneers as they saw -ne of theiri boats: shivered :to atoms before their eyes, and:the managled limbs of their companions tossed in the air. : -:Hewett perceiving at on e,t that it was certain defeat to remain longer in the boats, hastened to land and divide his: force into two par- ties ,toattack the town on eithert side, and so to take the fort from the rear. The landing was not accomplished without further loss, but was ially effected, and after a hot engagement, hand. to hand, with the Indians and Spaniards, who disputed their progress at every step, the buccaneers found themselves facing the fira of the soldiers from the rear of the fort., The firing, however, at this point did not last long. The priest, at the headfof his garrison;, soon, issued from the intrench. ment, sword in handi, and the, contest now, was which party should get possession. of .the church. The priest fought like a cruader of old. His sword flashed, and his armor gleamed in the thickest of the fight, ,and bhi blows were dealt with. an energy and effect, which the bucca- weers had not calculated on from the hands which had hitherto wielded only the missal and ithe cross. His followers, inspired by his example, attended by his side with the most determined courage, and the for- tune of war seemed for a moment to turn against the pirates. The priest and his party succeeded first in gaining the doors of the church, which were at once opened-.to them by the women within. The closing them, however, 'upon the assailants, was defeated by an united and desperate rush on the part of the buccaneers, who bore the barriers down, crushing women and children beneath their weight, and passing over their bodies into the aisles. The scene now became ter-     108'        MORGr, THE BUCER.. rifle. The shrieks of the women mingled with the shoutsof the coma. batants, and the pavement of the hurch w as soon slippery with blood and heaped with the slain. Even at his: altar,. the priest paused not in his character of warrior, but covering with his body the sacred host which stood thereon in its shrine of gold, he played his sword with deadly effect on those who ascended the steps to tear himnfrom his place. Steeled as Sewett and the pirates were to scenes of carnage, there was a sublimity in this picture of the champion of the altar, which filled them even in the heat of battle, with'feelings of awe, and as if by common consent, there was a pause in the contest. The Spa- nish soldiers immediately surr6unded their leader, and the pirates re- mained in theaisles, leaning on their arms, While the women knelt in groups on the bloody pavement, some wringing their. hands in despair, and tothers staunching the. flowing wounds of. the fallen. Each paty saw at a glance their relative position. The buccaneers were two: to one against the Spaniards, and Hewett, with a voice of triumph called on the latter to surrender. "Never," said the priest; i' the: Spaniard has yielded too often already to you who have, been the scourge-of these seas, and if the horrors of'this day shall tend to rouse the'whole coast to exterminate and destroy you, then this altar shall -not have been stained in vain'with our blood. Come on." "Your blood then be upon your own heads," exclaimed Hewett, as followed by hisco6m- panions, he rushed up the steps of the altar and made a pass at the head of the priest. The priest caught the blow on his sword, and the place of the altar now became the scene of a deadly struggle. It was terrible, but short. A blow from Hewett, aimed with fatal precision; clett'down through the skull of Father Antonie, and he fell dead-on the altar, covering it in his fall with: his blood and brains. The atful sight put an end atonce to the contest, for the Spanish soldiers imme- diately surrendered. Hewett himself, bloodhardened as' he'wag, felt as he contemplated the effect of his blow, that he was purchasing'vie- :tory and plunder at a horrifying cost, while the'French buccaneers dropped their,swords in momentary remorse for the dreadful rerflt. This revulsion of feeling, ^however; did not last long either on the part of Hewett or -his companions. .The usual business of rifling the church and- houses was soon commenced, and lasted until evening. Gold to the value of 20,000 pieces of eight was the reward of the victory, and the. buccaneers revelled on the success of their expedition until moral Early the next day, the buccaneers prepared to depart, and with: a generosity unusual with them, gave all their prisoners their liberty, whether in remorse for the death of the heroic priest, or because they  did not wish to be troubled with them, it is hard to determine. The buccaneers then once more hastened to their ships.   MORGAN, THE BUCCANrEEL    '     109 CHAPTER XXIII. The Buccaneers hold a Consultation-They turn .their Thoughts towards -sHome--Determine to cross to the. North Sea by the way of Segovia-Ex-. pEdition to Chiloteca-The Fat Governorm and the Female Breastplates- z Division of Plunder-Stratagem of the Cannon--Departure for the Nortl Sea . Soox after the successful adventure recorded in our last chapter, the French and English buccaneers anchored in the bay of Amapila. A consultation was how held as to their future course, and it was discovered, after a short interchange of opinion, that the thoughts of all were bent on home. Most of their present number had now been in the South Seas for more than three years, all had been successful, and with the exception of - a few, who had gambled away their gains, were rich in gold, silver and jewels. The Spaniards, also, roused at / last to energetic action by the number and frequency of the depreda- tions of: the buccaneers, were preparing in earnest to exterminate them from the coast, and of this fact the buccaneers were fully aware. Previous to finally determining whether they should leave the South Seas, Hewett and about seventy of' the buccaneen made an expedition to the shore, in order, if possible, to gain further intelligence. They landed early in the morning, but did not meet with any adventure or f, even a single native; and when at night they sought the bare earth for their beds, it was with feelings of weariness, gloom, and despond- ency.' The morning brought no abatement of these feelings, and fTew- ett :found that but eighteen of the party were willing to advance. Placing himself at the head of these, and directing the others to return and await him at the canoes, he marched onward. ,The little party had not proceeded more than a league, when they met-three horsemen. It was but the work of a moment to secure them, for being surrounded at once they cried for quarter. On being inter- rogated- by Hewett, they informed him, that about a quarter of a league distant, there was a small town called Chiloteca, wherein there were about four hundred Spaniards, beside a few negroes and indians, and that the inhabitants had not even heard or dreamed of the ap- proach of the buccaneers. On-receiving this intelligence, Hewett at first thought of returning after his comrades, whom he had just left; but fearing that in the meantime the people of the town would hear of his advance, he re- solved on the bold attempt of taking the placeo- by surprise with his , eighteen men. With the prisoners, therefore, for guides, the adventu- rous. party moved forward. They reached the town just at evening, and beheld the inhabitants assembled in the public square, listening to the strains of music.:s It was a festival, and all were out in their gay- apparel, and giving themselves up to the enjoyment bf the mo- ment. Fit-i: ^ yell, as if from a thousand throats, instead of :ninatea'and      "O        4kRGAN, TvjE, JBCC4NXSXKB with a volley of their fire-arms, the buccaneers threw themselves on the merry assemblage, and in a moment the scene of joy was changed to one of terror. The attack was so sudden and unexpected, that in their bewilderment and affright, the assailed looked not to see the num- ber of assailants. It was enough for them to know' that the yell iame from the throats of the buccaneers, and while, therefore the women fell shrieking to the ground, the men scampered for their horses, which were, according to the custom of the Spaniards, kept close at hand. Most of the men escaped in this way out of the town, but the Tenient, or Governor, was not among this number. lRe was short and fat, and in his haste had the misfortune to fall. Hewett was close on his heels, and picking him up with great courtesy, observed, that he could not think of letting him depart until he had received at his hands the-civ- ilities of the town. The buccaneers took in all about fifty prisoners, consisting mostly of women, whom having secured in the church,they proceeded as usual to search the town. They found an abundance of provisions, but no money or jewels. The good cheer, however, compensated in1 a great measure for the loss of rich booty, for they were almbst famished with lunger.. Having filled themselves to repletion, the next thing in order was to examine the Tenient. . They learned from him the unwelcome news, that a Spanish man- of- war, mounted with thirty guns, and manned with four hundred men, was in the port of Realeguo, on the watch to intercept their further progress on the coast. In the meantime, while the buccaneers weres examining the Tenient, a storm was browing for them which they lit- tle expected. The Spaniards, who at first, in their consternation, had taken to flight, had somewhat recovered from their surprise, and a few of the boldest of thdm had returned. to the town to reconnoitre. Find- ing by what a small force they had been scattered, they soon carried. the intelligence to their companions, and the whole body, numbering some two hundred, hastened back to retake the town, The buccaneers were pow in their turn struck with dismay, as they suddenly heard: the cry of "Have at ye, ye English dogs," and beheld a body of Span- ish horse charging with fury into the town. The buccaneers, however, were of different metal from the Spaniards, and although. they ran at the first alarm, they ran in order, and reached the church in safety. Here they had the advantage. -Iorses and swords were of no advan- tage to the Spaniards in the attempt to dislodge the pirates from the church, while on the other hand, the pirates kept up such a deadly fire from the windows, that in a short time but few of the horsemen 're. mained alive. The buccaneers then issued from the church, each bear- ing: with him a woman, and mounting the horses of their slain enemies, rode off with all possible speed.            . They had not ridden far, when they heard the sound of pursuit which they discovered pame from another body of.-Spanish horse  which hadbeen rallied together for the rescue.: flewett immediately': ordered his little troop to halt, and face thepursuers. "Ha [.my little governorI is it you that has turned so valiant?" exclaimed Hewetti as hb recognized inthe leader the faTeiennt of .Chiloteca. "Welly fife   MORGANI-: T  BUCCANEER .       ll away, you are two to one of the English dogs, you fsee there are but nineteen of uis, but you will also' perceive that each one of us has a fe- male breastplate in front, and mine, my little governor, happens to be your wife, so blaze away, or if you are short of fire-arms, cut away with your swords, it is all one to us, seeing that we shall hold up our breastplates for ball or blow." This new mode of defence caused the Tenient and his party to pause at once in their intended assault. Hew- ett then informed them, that he should now proceed on his way, and  that as the backs of himself and his companions would consequently be tuirned on the Spaniards, the first demonstration of attack on the part of the latter, would be the signal of each one of his party, himself in- cluded, to stab the woman whom he carried in front. This pleasing piece of intelligence having been given, the buccaneers, at the comn- mand of Hewett, again wheeled round and rode forward. The Spa- niards followed at a distance,. but without making any hostile demon- stration, for the sacrifice which would have been sure to follow, was too great :an offering to be laid even on tie altar of hatred for the bloody buccaneer.. -  The-buccaneers, bearing thus their protection before them, pursued their course unmolested, and on the day following, joined their com- panions atthe canoes. HLere Hewett waited for his- pursuers fo come up with him, and it was not long before they made their appearance on the shore. Hewett immediately liberated his female prisoners, ex- claiming as he did so, "Here, my little governor, take back your ex- cellent wife and her companions, we are greatly obliged for the protec- tion which :they have afforded to us in the weak state to which we weie lately reduced, but' being now rather stronger in numbers, we have no further need of their services, and if my friend the governor, has the'slightest inclination for a small gamne of blh6d, the English dogs are ready; 'Comrades, present arms, take aim-" "Hold!" screamed the Tenient, tumbling off his horse, and running to throw his arins around his spouse, " we have not the least wish in the world to harm such gentlemen pirates. We beg you would not lire now. They are waiting for us in Chiloteca, and we hasten back. Adieu, Senors, may the Holy Mother protect you," and climrbing up his horse with his wife, he gallopped off at full speed, followed by the whole troop, carrying with them the rest of the women. A long and loud shout of laughter rose from the buccaneers, as they embarked in their canoes and sought their ships. On consultation it was now resolved, at all hazards, to attempt a passage across the province of Guatimala, to the North Sea. The first thing consequent on. this determination, was the division of the re- maining undivided plunder. This was finally accomplished, although at the expense of much quarrelling, and one or two fights, in which the dagger was used without much ceremony. The division having been made, it appeared that, with the exception of some few, who, as we have mentioned before, had lost their money in gambling, the men were each worth over a hundred thousand pieces of eight, while Hewett, the Captain, Picard, the second in command, and Lusan, the third, were each possessed of some two hundred thousand, or more,     "2    e    MORGAN, iTHS tG3OANEER. pieces of eight. Besides this in money, all the buccaneers had a con- siderable amount of valuable jewels. The division being over, Hewett proposed that they should have one grand carouse, before they left the scene of their exploits, and as the proposition was one which was always received with attention by the buccaneers, it met with a tumultuous and unanimous approval on this occasion. It is nst necessary that we should describe this revel. It did not differ from those which we have often noticed during the progress of this narrative, except perhaps, that it was marked with a greater degree of wildness and abandonment, and lasted longer than usual. It came at length, however, to an end, and the buccaneers then prepared with energy for their departure. With the first light of the morning the buccaneers, hastily embark- ing in their canoes, reached the shore in safety. All things being in readiness, the buccaneers sunk their cazioes, and then, strange as it may seem, knclt down and. said their prayers, at least so says ohe of their number, who has left behind him a history of the exploits of this party, whose history we have been following. Their' devotioins over, the buccaneers took a farewell glance at the South Seas, and with the sound of the cannon of their ships, anti the answering fire of that of the Spaniards ringing in their ears, they moved briskly forward on their homeward march, their spirits elated with success and animated with hope.,  NoTE.-The remainder of the history of the Buccaneers will be found in , the sequel to this work, entitled, "DAVIS, TIE BUCCANEER; OR, TIE FR E- BOOTEK Op THE PACIFIC,.' now published.

The narrative bears upon the face of it an impress of truth; certainly the author has displayed a knowledge of human nature in all its phases, and without having his interest in the story weakened by exaggeration or improbability, the reader, when he lays the book aside, will unconsciously think of th l Truth is strange-stranger than Fiction!"

II New York: Long & Brother, 1853.-This volume is one of deep interest to those who can appreciate th of the practised lawyer working hs way through the intricacies of a complex plot. If the author could case of doubtful title as well before the legal court as he makes out his title to popularity before the courl opinion, we should have no fear to entrust all our claims to the castle of indolence (which are consideral argus eyes and patient industry. With the fancy and tact of a novelist, he combines the elaborate r which a forensic education can alone confer; and this concentration of style, which was the secret of E1 mysterious power, is here maintained throughout with unflagging interest. The character of Lady Ma cately and truthfully sketched; it neither exaggerates nor falls short of what our experience justifies. TI ter of Gripes fully sustains that inexplicable propensity which (in novels) is sustained between the ind God made him, and the patronymic conferred by his godfathers and godmothers in baptism. On the though the word lawyer rarely suggests aly pleasant ideas-there is no bar to our remembering grat member of the New York bar whose book may be had a bargain for 50 cents."-Jrational Democrat.
