THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES CHAPTRRi L., THE earliest recollection of my life is a vivi imp' ssio- o shrouded corpse, of a lonely grave and the hollow etunid of olo of earth falling upon a coffin. The next thing that I remneb*  ?    is being seated on a high stool in a large room with four: of-fi people ; very hard-hearted and cross-looking people I thoug] them to be, seated around me and -talking in low tones aboi : me. I recollect I was very much frightened, and that I kei biting at a piece of crape that somebody had tied about mhy o N, straw-hat, I did not know for what then. ' The next impressic :  left upon my memory as I send my mind back into the past, v  being a dweller in a large old house, which seemed a castle 1 g my young eyes, and subject to the control of a man and an o } woman, who had also other children jinder them, both boys an girls. We were eleven in number, four girls and seven boy 8 all barefooted, and very scantily and coarsely clad, atd treat t with great cruelty. My employment was to pick oaumkni i    i wool, called upa at d nd kept at work till I :feli iaees (18) p}1  P- Itr;-.x -     ; t     "  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. dark over my day's labours, with two meals a day, and no play, no luxuries, no kind words, no rest. We were a gang of little white slaves, and subject to the caprices and passions and heart-  less severity of the man and woman whom I feared, and trem- bled before and looked up to as if they had been God. In fact that great old house was, in my limited experience, my universe, and they were above all other beings the powerful rulers and controllers of it. How we came to be under their power, and from what source'they derived their terrible authority, we little tremblers never thought to ask. Indeed the thought of such an inquiry ieier came into our juvenile heads; we found our lot thus cast, and endured it as our destiny, like the tortoise, who never ask why they are tortoises and not eagles. It was as natural for us to be there as we were, as it was to have hands  to do our imposed tasks. But with the progress of diys antd months I grew older and naturally more refletive* I began to wonder what the stars were, ain how high up they probably were} and who lighted them every night? I asked no questions of anybody, but only thought these thoughts by myself when I would lie awake at night in my garret, too tired to sleep, or sore from a cruel whip- ping, and see the stars twinkling through-the crevices in the old roof, and love to fancy they were weeping with their eyes for my sufferings. In the daytime I would wonder where oakum came from, and then I would wonder what we picked so much of it for. These were but tie begnnings of curiosity-- the dawnings of the mind which no slavery will crush effectually. From day to day new thoughts came into my mind, and led to new inquiries intothings. At length I began to compare some things with others, and to wonder at their difference. I saw' that the men and wofien who' from time to time came to the old louse where we were kept imprisoned, were not exactly like the man and woman whom we feared..-I noticed that they dressed differently, and spoke more kindly to us. I observed, too, that   "FE AND ADVENTURER Of PERCIVAL MAIBItPRY.   1 when they brought children with them, those called them. by names we had no knowledge of: "Papa" and "Mamma," and that they did not tremble and fear to speak to our man and woman, whom we never called by any title at all, and to those faces we hardly dared to raise our timid eyes. I perceive also that they wore shoes and hats, and were not dressed at all as  we weere, in .uf coarse to w-cloth jackets and trowser. 3p, when they went: away, I wqoud sit and reflect and ask, myself why those children diffeprd froT u g Why we piekel oakum ani  they did not?

Why they had -Pa'  apid Ma's, agd Aw had only " the m n and waniVn?" add why they di nt :t reamble before thew "as we did? and why they didn't livy in the old house with us?

These mental inquiries were quite beyond my d epth to answer satisfactorily. One day, when I must have been in my tenth year, .0 ^rrai g drew up in front of the old habitation, and a lady opn lin.. She was accompanied by a little girl about nine or ten years of age. I shall never forget the impression ate upon my qi n4 by the appearance of this lady and her child.

I had no doubt of it at all. I dropped the bolt of oakum I was picking, and gazed at them,  but longest and last at the child-angel, till I felt as if wings were opening on each side of my heart, it seemed to pant so like a bird, to fly and share with them their beauty and glory. Suddenly a heavy blow descended upon my shoulders, accom.. panied with a command to heed my work, "for it was not for the likes of me to look at ladies." -Poor boy 1" said the lady, with a tone of pity that so touched the depths of my soul, to which the accents of sympathy never before penetrated, that I felt I would glaily have been struck  again and again to have my bosom stirred ;by such sweet words -so kind a voice. /"Naughty woman!" exclaimed, with a flushed cheek, the younger visiter, her blue eyes emitting flashes of indignation. "You are a wicked woman to do that. He was nut doing any. thing that you should strike him so."  "Hush, Anne-you are too hasty." "I would nrot, mamma, see a person strike my dog Philo with- out speaking, and when I'see this poor little boy beaten only for looking up as we came in, I ought to speak." ( Your generous feelings are too quick for your age, Anne." The spirited and humane angel (for such she seemed to me to be, still more, for I could not believe any but an angel would -dare to speak to the woman, our tyrant, so boldly) then approached me, and placing a piece of money in my hand, said, in words that seemed heavenly music:  "Take that, poor boy. You can buy some nice things with   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCOVAL MAYBERRY.'   17 it. I am afraid you don't get very many nice things here. Da you do nothing but sit here and pick this dirty stuff?" I was about to speak, but caught the red, angry eyes of the woman, which gleamed with vindictiveness upon the little maiden at the same time they threatened me if I dared to reply. But the presence of the lovely stranger gave me courage, and I answered: "We always work so. We never did any other work." "Anne, come, child," said the mother, "do not break the rules of the house by talking with the poor children. I fear the overseer's wife is displeased with you already." "'Oh, no, no, not a bit, marm, not one bit," responded the woman, her cracked, harsh voice trembling with anger. "She is a little girl, and we don't mind it. You see, marm, we must make 'em work and keep 'em strict, or they'll 'gin to master us. -You've no idee, marm," continued the withered tigress in a whine of apology, "of the trouble we have here. It's a pro- verb there is no childer so imperent as Poor House childer. That's true to gospel all the world over! If we gives 'em an inch, they'll take a yard, and a mile won't answer 'em. Now, there's that boy you pitied, and your daughter 'gin the, silve- half-dollar piece to, he's the worst boy among 'em. 'He's hard to manage, and is so forward, and if we didn't keep a tight rope on him, he'd come to the gallows, as he's like to yet." "He has a good face, and seems sprightly and intelligent," 1 heard the lady say. "What is his name?" '  "Percy Mayb'ry. But don't stay in this room, marm, where they are pickin', but come into the sittin' room." "I thank you," coldly answered the lady. I wish to obtain a child's nurse, and have come here to see if you have any girl ten or twelve years of age, active, well-disposed, and good-tem- pered, that I could take on trial before having her legally bound to me." "Come here, you Mary!" yelled out the old haridan, accom-     1              ,         . I  : 18  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. panying the voice with a beckoning gesture of her bony hands, come along here into the parlour, and let this lady see you." The girl thus spoken to was a kind, patient child ofeleven, with the most forbearing temper towards her tyrants, who often brutally beat her for the most trifling fault; she now rose from her task, for we were all seated about the sides of an old raftered room at our work, and smiling, said, with all her heart in her voice, Oh, I do hope she will take me away with her." "So do I," cried I warmly. "So do we all, Mary," was echoed from all the little girls and boys in the picking-room in a suppressed whisper, not to be overheard by our mistress, who had gone out with the lady. Poor, dear children! Row much you must suffer here to want to get away so!" said the stranger little girl in the pink hat. "I wish you would take Mary with you--she suffers most of all," cried I, addressing her, and forgetful, while gazing on her lovely face, of the wrath of the woman. "I will ask mamma, for I know she must be good, you all love her so. Would you all like to have some tarts?" she asked, with the buoyancy of her age. "We don't know what they are," I answered, acting as spokesman for he rest; for we were all now idle, and every one was looking wonderingly at the blue-eyed stranger, who, com- pared. with the poor little ignorant girls in the room, seemed to be a superior being. "Not know tarts? How funny, and yet how sorry I am for you! You know candy?" We all shook our heads. "Bonbons, or cake?" Another general negative of the uncombed heads, accompanied with expressions of lively curiosity. "Well, how odd, you never ate tarts, nor candy, nor cake!   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBEtRRY.  What a treat you shall have! I will make you all a present. What do you have to eat here?"          , Corn bread, salt fi$h, and soup," I ansered. f' Never anything else?" she exclaimed. "Nothing else," was my very decided reply. "What a horrid place! You shall have a treat now," she said, her bright eyes sparkling through tears; and going to the door, she called to a servant and gave him an order. She then returned tripping and clapping her hands, and looking so happy that we gazed on with admiration, for we had never seen a happy face. Her joyous voice, too, filled us with strange delight; for in that place we never heard joyous voices; the voice of scolding, the broken murmurs of grief, and cries of pain, were accents alone familiar to our ears. During the interval which elapsed before the servant returned, and while her mother and the overseer woman were out, this seraphic child did fifty things to make us happy. She said all our faces looked as if we had never laughed in our lives, and she would make us laugh. So she would pirouette and waltz with the grace of a zephyr embodied. She would sing parts of merry songs, tell us. laughable stories, and even recited a humorous ballad. At'length, she would have us all up and make us take hold of hands and form a ring, and placing herself in the centre, start us round in a game which she called " oats, peas, beans, and barley, O!" which words she made us repeat after herlas we tramped round and round. Never had the picking-room witnessed such a scene before. Never had the wretched little oakum-pickers in it perpetrated such unheard of enormities as were now progressing. With trembling hearts for fear of consequences, yet irresistibly carried away by the beauty, the fascination, the example and high spirits of the beautiful stranger, we gradually overcame our timidity, and let out our long, long hushed voices in full chorus, It was at this moment that the. door leading to the "parlour"     20  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. burst open, and the overseer woman appeared! What pen can portray the looks of mingled surprise, horror, and indignation which her rheumy features manifested at the sight that her frowning eyes beheld! She stood petrified, her lips parted, but speak she could not, for words were wholly inadequate to utter all she felt. I recol- lect that the paramount andiruling expression of her countenance was incredulity, as if she doubted whether what she saw before her eyes was reality or a horrible dream. We also stood petrified! every one of us hand clasped in hand, just as the sight of her had arrested us in the full hilarity of our mirth,-mirth that forgot all present dangers. Shaking like trembling leaves,'we turned our eyes from the terrible visage of our tyrant to the face of the lovely child, as if confident in her protection. There, in the centre, she stood, unmoved, unalarmed, with a smile on her face and happiness in her eye. "I am teaching your poor children how to play," she said, without a particle of fear, and as if she had been doing a praise. worthy action. "Don't be frightened, children. She won't harm you, for my sake. Now don't look angry at them. It is my fault! If anybody is to be, punished, it shall be me I I am willing to be punished to have seen them all so merry as they have been." "No! no! punish us all-punish harder than you ever did before,-but don't hurt her," we all burst out at once, with a hearty good-will that did us all credit, considering the imper- fections 'of our education. The vinegar face of the woman underwent no change from its vindictive expression. She looked at the lovely child as if she would gladly dare to lay her cruel hands upon her slight and symmetrical figure. From the stern glance which she fixed upon her, I believed she would spring at, her, in which case I had resolved to stand between her and the blows; nay, such a new creature had the presence of this noble child made me, that, in   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. her defence, I would have attacked the terrible woman her- self. "Anne has done wrong; she has been thoughtless," said her mother to the woman, who seemed impatient to have her gone, tha t she might take her revenge upon us who had, in the mean- while, retreated to our work, which we were resuming with trembling fingers and anxious glances at the parties. "Oh, yes, marm, I'll let it pass. She didn't know, perhaps," creaked the woman,-for "the woman" and "the man" were the only appellatives we knew them by, or ever bestowed upon them.  "Then you promise you won't punish them?" inquired the generous Anne,} "seeing it was not their fault at all?" "I'll not hurt 'em," answered the woman, in a tone that we all well knew'meant that she intended to hurt us a little more than usual. The lady then took her leave, accompanied by Mary, and saying a kind "good-bye" to us, which Anne also repeated with a smile at the little girls; and, as she went out after her mother, I fancied she looked at me last, and believed she meant her last good-bye and smile for me. The voice and smile mingled in my dreams, nevertheless, long, long afterwards. The door, had hardly closed behind them, when the woman turned towards us, and shaking her long forefinger at us, while her little red eyes blazed beneath her shaggy eyebrows through her spectacles, like fire-light gleaming through the two windows of a low-eaved hut. With the departure of the two "angels" went all my courage, and I sat before her, feeling deadly pale and terribly frightened, while my fellow victims in trouble shook, not exactly in their shoes, for they had' never worn any, but in their skins, which seemed sensitive at the prospect of what they were about to suffer. She did not at first speak, but stood point- ing her finger at each one of us individually, as if numbering us for the slaughter, and with &n especial vindictiveness at me,     22  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCTVA. L MAYBERRY. as if she regarded me as a sort of ringleader. 'All the while she mumbled indistinctly through her toothless gums,-toothless, save one horrible eye-tooth, protruding like a boar's tusk.-At length her voice came to her, and she opened her mouth with a sort of scream at us, and commenced discharging a torrent of abuse upon us, when the door opened, and, like a sunbeam from heaven, the beautiful bright face of the noble little Anne appeared, all smiles, and beaming with anticipations of the happiness of which she was the bearer to us. At first the awful stillness, the fear-stricken visages, and the thunder-clouded brow of the woman startled her; but, as cou- rageous as she was beautiful, she did not let this check her in her intentions, and bounding up to a broken table that stood in the room, or rather, for want of a fourth leg, leaned against the wall, she opened first one large bundle, and pouring out its con- tents, cried with a joyousness and kindness that made our faint hearts thrill again. "There are tarts; one for each of you. I know you will like them so much." , She then untied another parcel, and displaying its contents to our admiring eyes, exclaimed: "And there are bonbons, candies of all sorts.-You don't know how good candy is." Then opening a third paper, bigger than all .the rest, she exhibited to our open-eyed wonder a pile of little brawn things that looked as if they were covered with snow.. "And there yre the cakes, nicely frosted, and so good.' With this bounteous sight, some of us half rose from those little blocks on which we sat instead of chairs; but a fierce look and a snarl of the glittering eye-tooth chained us to our seats. "Come, now, and let me give them to you. -I know you won't say anything, will you, my dear, good woman?" said she, with the most winning persuasiveness, looking round and speak- ing to our mistress. The woman, taken by surprise with the   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.  charm of her voice and manner, could only mumble, aiid yield like-an inferior bendingI before a superior. Our visiting angel then handed round a trt, a cake, and some sticks of candy to i each of us, for we were fifteen in all, our numbers varying from time to time with departures and new arrivals. "I have just enough, for I counted you," she said, as she looked round upon us after her distribution with a look of good- ness and love, and of sweet charity, that gave to her countenance a celestial expression. '"Now eat, and have a nice time toge- ther; Won't you let them, good, dear ma'am?" The woman tried to smile, but she had better have remained passive, for her look was so hideous that Anne gave utterance to an exclamation of fear, and saying, "Poor children! I hope you will be happier, and find good. friends/, left us with ^ parting look, shining with tears. I could have bounded forward and pressed my lips to the very door upon which she had stood. the closing door sounded like a knell to my heart, and I knew it did to the -hearts 6f the rest. It seemed night, and cold, as if the sun had been suddenly extinguished.- There followed a moment of intense silence--of awful 6xpec- tation. With the rolling aray of the distant carriage-wheels sunk our spirits within us. At length she spoke: , a Oh, you little miss, you proud, irde8pendent little thing," she cried, spitefully, as she shook her hand after her; "I wish I had you here under my thumb for one month as I have these, that I do!" Here she exitended her long thumb, dirty with onstant snuff-taking, and brought it down emphatically into the palm of her left hand, into which she violently screwed and' twisted it as if the said little Anne was, in her imagination, there undergoing compressure. "A pert minx, to Comne here to the county work-house and cut\ up sich doin's as the likes o' these.!-Why the childer'll be ruined for enny purpose on airth! You Dick, don't you dare for to go for to put that to your mouth, 2    24  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. if you don't want your ears cut off. Yes, I would give a month's wages, if I could ony have my satisfaction out o' you, miss, and I ony hopes to marcy your rich father and mother'll die and leave you a orphan like these, so you'll have to come under my thumb! Wouldn't I make it 'greealle to you! Oh you little wretches! oh," and here came the address direct, "you misera- ble varmints! oh, you poverty-stricken vagabonds! so, you and young miss have had a nice time of it! oh, I dare say! I dare say! Your dancin' and runnin' in rings, and singin', and tantrums, and all them devilums!--Nice doin's for the county work-house! I guess miss better be 'gaged to keep dancin'- school for you, and teach you the 'eomplishings, an' make ladieses and gentlemanses of you at once! oh, you wretches'! ant you shamed o' yourselves! what shall I do? yes, what shall I do to you? There you set with your hands full o' cake and candy! Did ever! was the like ever knowed? Wall, miss has carried it her own way! now I'll carry it my way! Walk straight up here one at the time, and put all them things right lown on the table again. Do it quick, afore I roast you alive!" She looked now like a very pythoness. Her short gray hair, which had been shaven for some disease on the head, seemed to bristle with suppressed rage. She walked to and fro before the table, while the littlest ones first approached and placed their untasted presents on it, crying all the while as if their hearts would break. The older ones went up last, slowly and reluctantly. There were two older than myself, one of them was Dick Tuckett, who was thirteen, a great overgrown urchin, and Hetty Dodge, pretty, pale and dark-eyed, with hair like,a raven's wing. When it came my turn, I inwardly resolved I would not give up-what I had received. I felt it would be an insult to the brave andc generous little maiden who had taken so much pleasure in pur- chasing them for us. Hetty seemed to understand and read every look, for she whispered, "Keep yours, jPercy, and I will."   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.   2 "And dang her, so'll I too,' gruffed out Dick, for he -had b2 nature one of those boatswain's voices to which there is nm whispering key, and in which any attempt to speak low-onlj results in a husky growl. The woman now looked at me and pointed at the table, with X glance that would have made me shake before the advent of little Anne. But her presence had infused courage and power, and given birth to a spirit of independence in my soul. The-womat and my dreadful home were no longer the whole world to mj mind. I had learned that there was a world outside of oui prison walls, and that it contained beings who loved and who inspired affection, contact with whom awakened the purest emo- tions in the soul. The woman and the man no longer filled the whole horizon of my view. In reply to her sign and look I sat perfectly still. I trembled at my presumption, but I resolved to die rater than yield. My fear for her was now rather con- verted into hate, in that she had shown such malice towards one who had dawned upon my being with the first ray of hope and true life it had ever. known. "Percy Mayberry, are you going to rebel! I will skin you alive!" she yelled with fury. "I won't give it to you. I hate you! I am not afraid of you any more!"I answered with a face as white as snow, but a spirit firm as a rock. "That's the way to talk up!" cried Dick, with an excited howl. "She shan't have mine nuther, drat it if she shull!" "Nor mine," quietly said Hetty. If the rickety old floor had opened beneath her feet and the horned!Sathanas had appeared in the gap visibly before her eyes, she would have looked probably prettymuch as she did when she heard this startling volley of replies. She gave a single moment to drink in the full realities of the truth, and then sprang first upon me wjith both arms stretched out and her hands bent like claws to clasp me round the throat. But I     26  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. leaped lightly aside, when she fell over my block; but as quick as a cat she was upon her feet, for she was all bone and sinew, like a Salem witch, and made after me. I dodged hither and thither, and was put at disadvantage by having the tart, cake, and bonbons in my hands which I tried to preserve, with an inward, half-formedc notion that' I would try to keep them as long as I lived for Anne's sake. At length she caught me by one of my ears, and I verily believe would have torn it off, but for Dick, who grasped hold of her hair, and pulled back so lustily that she released me to attack hei hew enemy. Dick was clumsy and could not get out of het way, so she had him by the throat, her favourite way of taking us into custody, and laid him on his back among the oakum. I hastily placed my cake and tart in Hetty's hands, and told her to run out and hide them, and then went to Dick's rescae; and good need there was, for she actu- ally ha his pug nose in her toothless jaws, and was oing her best to munch it, while her hands were both busy at his ears, which were made of unusually tough leather, or they would on that occasion have parted company with his head. The rest of the children in the meanwhile were screaming,or hysterically laughing, or dancing round crying, and immeasurably increasing the uproar, and all the time was heard the under key of Dick's angry growl of anguish, and the shrill tenor accompaniment, of three octaves higher, of the she-tyrant. I had to sooner seen Hetty get safe out of the room with what I had entrusted to her keeping, than I flew to help Dick, who bellowed like a hurt calf. I imitated her own tactics, and caught her by both ears, which I twisted in the scientific man- ner she herself had taught me, when practising Upon my own. Dick was instantly released and got to his feet, while with shrieks of pain the old dame tried to turn upon me; but, hold- ing fast and telling Dick to run) I no sooner saw him disappear, than I released her, and followed him at my best speed of foot. Escape from the place was out of the question, if such an idea ,    . .   .   "FE AND ADVENTURES OR PIERCIVAL MAYBERRY.   2' had occurred to my mind, as it was surrounded on three Sides by a high wall, enclosing a yard and garden--the house form-, ing the fourth side, with its front door always under bolt. There were only three parts of the house that appertained to us; one' ' of these was the picking-room, where our battle royal had ocs curred, and which we had now- vacated, as being too warm, the dining-room, and our garret, where we slept. The garret, there- fore, occurred to 'me as the only place:' of temporary security, until we should see how affairs would turn up. So, overtaking" Dick in the yard, I called out, a To the garret!"  The way to it was by a long flight of stairs, built up on the outer side of the south wall of the house, and was reached. by forty-four steps, almost as steep as' a ladder. The sleeping-room covered in size. the whole breadth of the house, and was divided by a plank partition into two equal. compartments, in one of which slept the little girls,'who reached their beds by a stairway that led from within the house. The two rooms were large, and lighted by four dormer windows, projecting out upon both roofs. We had no sooner gained by its lofty steps our garret, than I placed a beam of wood against the door, and then sat down upon it, to reflect upon what -ought to be done. Dick sat down oppo- site to me on a piece of candle-box, and looked very red with his swelled nose and burning ears. He seemed to be waiting for me to speak, though he was full three years older; but' though slow of wit, he was good-hearted, and 'as faithful as a house-dog..  "It's plain enough we shall- get the worst of it at last, Dick," I said, after a minute's profound revery. "Yes, May, we've got t0 take it, sure. But I'm willin', coz I's used to it, and I am willin' to take a floggin' on that purty"  little leddy's account. Oh, myl didn't her eyes shine bright--, bright as, bright'as a couple o' lightnin' bugs!"  Here Dick wiped the blood from- his nose, for the woman had managed to stick her white fang into it, and' looked very de- termined, as he added, " Id be whopped twist a-day till king    28  IfE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. dom come, if I could ony get to see her onct a month a' innit. Oh! didn't her voice sound like a robin red-breast in a shady tree! Hark-they are comin'; I hear 'em! Well, we must let 'em do their worstest, and I won't beg no favours o' the old one, if she should roast me on her gridiron." "It is some one in the girls' room," I said. "It is Hetty's voice. She's run up there, too. What say, Hetty.?" "Here's your cakes, Percy," she said. I'll reach 'em over the top." So the brave little girl stretched her hand through a narrow space between the partition and roof, and reached the presents to me, and I ran and hid them immediately between a loose shingle and a rafter, and then thanked her heartily. '"Don't let's let 'em thrash that gal, May?" said Dick, stoutly.       - "I wn't," I answered ; "but what can we do?" "Iaam not afraid of them, Mayberry. They can't hurt me. They've whipped me so often, I don't mind it. ' I am willing to be hurt a little for such good cake as this. Have you tasted yours?" she called softly through the partition. "No," I answered, stoutly, and with the tone of one who did not itend to taste either; but Dick, with his mouth full of tart, qgrwled b aek that he was eating "his'n, and it was the peskiest go4 thing he'd ever had his tooth into in his born days.' Indeed, he seemed to forget the peril he was in as a rebel in the enjoymegts of delicaPiees itherto a stranger to his palate. As for me, I felt somewhat seripus as Irefected what might be the, isue of .orir .drin deeds. IRut I consoled myself at the thoupght that they, ould. do no more than wjhip me.; and casti- gations, as I have, already said, were too frequent for no fault, to cause me much solicitude.  "I expect," sid Hetty, " they will lock us up here and give u nothing to eat for four days, as they did you once, Percy, whn you broke the earthen platter."   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.   29 "Well, let them; I can stand it, Hetty; but I am afraid you'll, suffer most," I said, with a kind feeling for this good girl, who always seemed to like me, and who often, when she got through her task,:would help me with mine; so there existed the best kind of feeling between us; and I would have fought for her at any time; but she had never inspired me with any- thing at all kindred to the deep, adoring sentiments of reverence and gratitude, admiration and elevation of thought, which the beautiful being, Anne, had awakened in my soul. "There they come! 'Don't you hear the noise they are making below?" she asked, quickly. ' "That is the man's voice, too(" said Dick; " he' come home; and is goin' to help the woman whop us. He'll give us the Ten Commandments." We could now hear a great uproar of voices and feet below; for after we had reached our garret, all things had appeared quiet in the picking-room; but this stillness was. now at an end, and the storm was ready to burst. The husband of the woman we could hear uttering drunken oaths, and swearing to kill every one of-us. He had been at work in a corn-patch not far off, when the battle in the oakum-room took place, and, having been sent for, listened with rage at the narrative given by the woman. Opening a hole in the boards of the garret by:shoving a plank aside, I could look down into the yard. The scene to a painter of the ludicrous would have been deeply interesting; but to me, a poor boy of ten years, it was appalling. At the door of the picking-room, we could see the mqn standing, with a whip made of ten thick cords twisted into one for a handle, with the ten. tails flying, and each knotted at the extremity. This the bar- barian called the "Ten Commandments," and was used upon us when any of us had committed offences, real or imagined, till they amounted to ten, when, though we had received correction for each offence .at the time, yet when ten were reached, he used to. take this whip, and, as he said, balance accounts, by giving ten lashes with it upon our bare bodies, making one hundred 3*     30  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAIYBERR;Y. strokes. More than once I had-felt the cruel weight of this instrument of torture on my tender young flesh, and I had seen Hetty and the other girls whipped with it till their shoulders were striped like the American flag, blood-red and white. The man was a short, thick-set fellow, with a beast-like neck and shoulders, a hairy breast, which he never covered, a low brow, and long, straight, black hair, that was cut round like a sable fringe, giving to his vulgar countenance a vile, hang-dog look. His mouth was small, and set closely with small teeth, which he showed like a terrier when things didn't please him. I He was a hard drinker, and when in his cups was cruel, not only to us, but would maltreat his wife, who, terrible as she was to us, stood in healthy terror of him. They were a well- matched pair, and were perfectly united in their inhuman treat- ment of us, who, by some Providence which I had not yet fathomed, had been subjected to their tyrannous authority. From the loop-hole which I had made in the loose boards, I could see him standing by the oakum-room door with the ten- tailed lash in his grasp. His coat was off; and the hair on his naked breast bristled like a boar's mane. His veiy looks were terrible. The woman, as I looked, was in the act of bring- ing up to him by the ears one of the children. Its screams pierced my ears, and accustomed as I was to these sounds and sights, I Closed my eyes as I saw him lift high above his head the terrible lash to bring it down on the tender back of the little girl which the woman had exposed for the purpose. Hard and short fell the stroke, and the shriek of unendurable agony was stifled by the hand of the pythoness pressed tightly over the mouth.-Another lash, and the shrieks broke out wild and clear, mingled with the oaths of the man at her outcry. "Who is he whopping?" asked Dick, who sat loitering on his box, and forgetting to eat the residue of his tart. "It is little Neely,". I answered. This child, which was scarcely eight years old, always pale and suffering from a spinal   "TFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBIERY.   31 affection, from its very 'helplessness, had won stout Dick's ten- derness, and she was a great favourite of his; and he manifested the goodness of his honest heart by easing her of her heavy tasks whenever he could do so.  "Dom 'em i" cried Dick, starting up, and doubling his fist, "if I don't wish I was a. man. 'I. be half a mind as it be, to go down and make 'em stop whoppin' little Neely. .They are born brutes to hurt her when she hant done nothin'. There's another scream from her worse than the rest! -I'll kill him!" and the indignant boy tramped the garret floor with a look that showed he only wanted the strength to fly to the rescue of his little favourite. With every blow he winced as if it had fallen on his own shoulders, so keenly did he sympathize in the sufferings his little friend was undergoing. At length, though the blows ceased not, we heard no more shrieks, and Dick said, gloomily- t They've tied up her mouth; but they needn't doit! -The old house is too far off from the road for people to hear, and if they do, why screams here is so common nobody don't notice it. The whole world, May, wouldn't care if we work-house children were boiled alive. We are poor orphins, and nobody don't care for none on us "  "The reason she don't scream is because she has no life in her," I cried with horror, as I saw the little girl fall as it were dead, and stir neither hand nor foot beneath the descending blows. "They've whipped her dead, Dick!"  He sprung to the opening and looked down, but she was not seen now, having been carried in by the woman, who re-appeared dragging a little boy, one of the most innocent little fellows we had among us, and whom nobody could help loving. We saw him stripped and whipped with the same fiendish cru- elty; but he neither cried out nor winced, but bore the torture with an innate courage that seemed to bid defiance to his tyrant. He was removed bleeding, and, because he would not cry, the .     32  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. fiendess poured from a cup, which she had already mixed, salt and water upon his living wounds. He sent the most piercing cry of anguish up to the God of the orphan, and then, falling upon the earth, he rolled nearly across the yard with a velocity inconceivable, the effect of his horrible pain of body. He then sprung to his feet, and, with his senses quitting him, leaped, as if to seek relief in the coldness of the water, into the open cis- tern, and disappeared beneath the dark surface. All was now uproar and consternation in the yard. The children screamed fearfully; the man, who was about to admi- nister punishment to a third, stopped as if alarmed. The woman called out: "Skinner, don't let him drown! don't let him drown!-we Shall both be hanged! Run, man, run! and get him out." The man seemed to be recalled by her greater presence of minid to action, and, dropping his lash, he hastened to the cis- tern. Little Billy had risen to the surface, and, with instinctive love of life-even such life as was ours there-he grasped at the sides. Here he held on until the man reached down, and, taking him by the hair, dragged him out and flung him angrily upon the ground. Poor little Billy got to his knees, and, looking up to the sky, called out to God: "Oh, God! let me die! Oh, Lord! take little Billy to Heaven! Oh, Lord! don't let me live no more!" Dick and I burst out crying on hearing him, and then we both said, at the same time, "Let's go down for him!" As if by one impulse, we removed the bar, opened the door, and ran down the stairs into the court. We caught the suffer- ing lad in our arms, and, without speaking a word or looking round, we hurried back with him and took him with us into the garret, against the door of which we replaced the timber. The poor boy's eyes beamed upon us with gratitude. There was some *ater in the garret, with which we cleanse'd te 'sing-   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.    33 ing salt water from his wounded ick t nd arms, and, with a piece of tallow candle, we softened them, and then covered them with the softest oakum. He soon grew easier, and when we laid him dowi on our cot, he kissed our hands, tnd looked his thanks so eloqaetitly, that wh felt We had been 'well repaid f6o the additional risk we had placed ourselves ifl by this impulsive act of humanity.

At length I heard him say--- I'nm ready now for 'em!" He was now visible, crossing the yard to the foot of the stairs. His wife followed him with two flat-irons. He carried beneath his arm a piece of strong cord, and his "cat." "He's" coming, Dick," I said, softly. "Dord dearn 'un! let 'um come. I aint afeard on 'umn! They can't more nor kill us!" he answered,. with sullen despair -for we were not too young to feel despair.  "We will all ask God to let us die together!" softly said little Billy, opening wide his large hazel eyes, now larger and brighter, it seemed to me, than they ever looked before. "Do you know. we shall go straight from this garret to a gold palace in the sky, and there will be no wicked people to hurt us, and we shan't cry any more, nor be sick, nor feel no more pain! Oh! what a good place for poor little orphans Heaven is, Dick!" And the child folded his pale hands together, and looked up and smiled! "Where did you learn about this, Billy?-" asked Dick. - "My. mamma told me "  * "Then you had ama?" exclaimed Dick, with surprise and evident admiration.  "Oh, yes!

If we refused to open tI door, it would eventually be broken in, and we should fare tl worse for it; while on the other hand, if we opened it to then they might, in the high temper of their fury, absolutely murde us. For my part, I felt no disposition to die. Bad as the wor] was, or such part as had been my share of it, I was willir to remain in it; and I had that day learned that there we beings, good and beautiful, in. it, worth living for. I therefo said to Dick, who looked at me inquiringly as they thundered 4 the outside-- "Let's not let them come in, Dick! If they get in now, the will kill us." "That they, wull, May.

Dick made a sign for me to approach hi and then pointed to little Billy. He had his eyes closed, hands crossed on his breast, and a sweet smile reposing ab his mouth.     .  ,.-' *'   E   :   '  '  *  ' '     O3G  ITFE AND ADVENTURES OF PFRCIVAL MAYBERRY. "Ain't he apurty sight, May? Dang me, if I don't thinh he means as he says, and is trying to die and go up to heaven, where he says his mother is-it's up in -the stars, I reckon, where she is." His further reflections were interrupted by a terrible crash, and the upper panel of the door, which was old and rotten, was dashed in, and with it came in the boot and leg which had done the work. I saw that it was iow all up with us. But I was not frightened. I felt brave and resolute, 'and indignation rather than fear filled my bosoii. It would not have been thus twentiy- four hours before. Up to that tiie I hid been a trembling slave; but since I had seen Hand talked with the lovely Anne, I had a new nature awaklened in ime-a bold, indepnent, lofty spirit. The very thought of ier maide me feel as resolute as a lion--t firm as a hero. I had beheld her superiority over our tyrants, and I seemed now to share with her a part of that superiority, and to look ipon them with conitempt-the whose very feet I would have kissed but yesterday in servile homage; for I lknew none superior to thii-knew hi6t any cereated beings were above them. But my eyes, the eyes bf my spirit and of my itelli- gence, were opened, and I kine twhat "they Were tnaked," stiippbd of every terror anid power thiat had 'aptivated my poor ienses. Having broken in the panel, Shirkey reached in and removei the bracing timber, and threw wide the door. In a moment I was in his hands, and Dick in those of his wife; but the lad broke from her, and would have escaped, but for a blow from Skinner's fist, which felled him to the floor. "Lay there till I am ready for yon!" he vociferated. And. now, young blood," he continued, addressing me, "let us give you your due. You will one day be hanged, and so I will give you a taste of it beforehand. rll teach you to lead a rebellion, and take airs upon yourself. The devil himself seems to have been let into the work-house by that young miss. But we know how to serve such gentry."  All the while he was talking he was binding thongs about my   "FE AND ADVENTURES OR PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 37 thumbs, so tight that he made the balls red and hard, like a pai of emery balls, pressed out with blood, however, instead of sand. He then extended the two thongs, and cast them across a beam in the garret,. and giving one end to his wife, while he himself took the other, he proceeded coolly and adroitly to hoist me up. I was soon swinging by my thumbs clear of the floor, with my arms extended as if I were crucified.  "A  little higher,"- squeaked the woman, aW' she stoopec down to place something under my feet. - An inch higher. That'll do." Scarcely had she spoken, when I. sprung into the air as if ] had been bitten. ' The fiend had placed a hot flat-irni just at the point beneath me, where my toes would be whenever I let them hang down.-The jerk I gave in burning my feet nearly tore my thumbs off, and hurt mne excruciatingly; but I refused to gratify my tormentors by uttering a cry of complaint or suffering. "Now hang there, boy," said Skinner, when he had satisfied himself that I was well secured. "You don't get down again in a hurry. I guess that'll do you nmore good than the eat. It'll be pleasant enough when you get used to it." With a hard, mocking laugh, he then left me and went to lift up Dick, whose forehead was bruised and pleeding with the blow he had received. "Come, boy, out o' this," he said, brutally shaking him; "it's no use playin' possum with me," and he lifted him to his feet, but he could not stand. "I'll bring him to, I guess," shrilly screamed out the old woman, and, taking the second flat-iron, she placed it, hot and searing as it was, against his cheek. It caused a convulsive shudder to pass through his frame, and he sprung to his feet with a yell of agony. "I thought so," muttered the woman, scoffingly. "I wish I was bigger, I do-if I wouldn't wollop you " menaced Dick, as well as he could articulate. "Take that Again," cried the woman, touching him smartly     38  LIFE AND ADVENTURES 02? t.,;'LxVYAL MAYBERRRr. on the other cheek with the iron. We'll,teach you imperence here 1!" Dick doubled his fist and growled; but;' seeing me patiently hanging, he tried to imitate me, and, when Skinner ordered him to hold out his thumbs, he obeyed, by holding. out both; for he was so attached to'me, that. I believe if he had :seen me hang- ing by the neck, he would have willingly thrust his head 'into the noose to hang with me. In a few seconds he was tied to the beam facing me, and the flat-iron accurately fitted beneath his feet, so that we had to keep our knees bent up in a most painful posture to escape the blistering irons. After they had suspended us to their satisfaction, which they manifested by walking. several times around us, and surveying us, she cast her eyes upon little Billy, who lay on my saw-dust mattrass on the floor-for I had let him have mine, as it was softer than the rest, which were stuffed with carpenters' shav- ings, the ticking being corn-bagging. Skinner," said 'the wife, in a 'low tone of, apprehension, as she stooped above him," Skinner, come here." He approached the cot of the child. I saw them look at it, exchange glances, and he laid his hand on the boy's forehead. "Pshal he's alive! he'll do well enough!" was his answer, evidently spoken with a sigh of great relief; for they plainly believed him to be, as he looked, dead. "I am awful glad 1" she said, with a tone of selfish gratula- tion. "Yes, I feel his pulse. EIe'll sleep and be up again. But my heart (this was spoken vey low for his ear) was in my mouth for a minnit."  ' So you thought the brat Neely was dead, yet she only fainted like."  a These. poor-house children are tougher than the rich ones, that's certain," she added, with emphasis on the word poor. "Oh, ain't ye a pair!" This was addressed sneeringly to Dick and myself.--"Don't you look like good boys, as ye are!   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.    39 Wouldn't you like, Master Parcy, to ha' yer thumb in yer tart; and, Master Dick, will yer suck a- stick o' candy, if I'll take pity on yer and give. you one -Perhaps you'd like to suck your thumb, as you ,an't got entirely broke off yet since ye first came here,. a freckled-faced brat, three year old! ' "Leave 'em, woman, they'll get enough of it without your tongue drivin' at 'em. They've got just what'll suit 'em. Come on, .and let 'em hang. 'I want'to shut the door." The pair went out together, the door was closed and bolted, and we were left suspended from the two beams, each looking into the other's face. Dick gritted his teeth, and" dommed their picturs," and I set my lips to prevent crying out with my tor- ments; for, as my thumbs supported the whole weight of my body, the strain upon them and the arm was almost unendurable by stronger nerves than mine; but I called up the sweet- coun tenance of Anne, and tried to bear my sufferings. "Good-bye to yer-yer pesky wicked critturs! rd raythei hang here by my two thumbs," said Dick, "than ever see yei agen, dern ye both I How do ye feel, May?" he inquired, hir face twisting horribly and ludicrously as his big toe accidentalB rested on the hot flat-iron. I could not help laughing at his grimace, in agony as I was and when he saw me laugh he tried to laugh too, but he 'mad4 doleful work of it, for as he was stouter and heavier than I, he suffered most. The tears came into his eyes, and trilling dowi his cheeks, extinguished the grin. 'In fact, it was no laughing matter for either of us.

I suggested to Dick, was evidently a ray oi comfort to him. I tried to get rid of the iron by kicking i away, but the woman, anticipating this, had stuck -a -.brick int the handle of each. Dick at length began to lose patience. "Don't it hurt you pesky bad, May?" he whined, castin across to me a doleful look.'   .*   3*     40  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. "Yes, but I can bear it, for Anne's sake." "Plague take her! If she'd kept away, we wouldn't h6d any o' this to bear. It's all her doin'." "Aint you ashamed, Dick?  How could she expect her goodness to us would turn out so?"I said, warming in her defence. "Wull, she couldn't, coz she didn't know the natur o' the pesky man and woman. I doesn't blame her, and I wont, coz I see you likes her, May."  "Who could help likipg the first person that ever pitied and spoke kind to us, Dick?" "Wull, I likes her tod, and I'll try and bear this hanging, but it's e'enamost hauled my hands out o'my wrist holes. Jist look at my thumbs, if they aint black as a niggers, and a burstin'. There's little Billy wakin' up." The child looked round, and seeing us, burst into tears, and said, "Oh,. how he pitied us,' and he would try and get up and help us." But Dick, who, though much less able to endure pain than I, and although moaning -at every breath, generously for-. bade him, saying, "'That if' they found it out, they would kill him." But Billy feared not death, but rather braved it. So he crawled from his cot, with great anguish to his back, but he made no complaint, and only showed his sufferings by the deadly paleness of his face. He first pulled the irons from beneath our feet, which was a great relief to us, as it enabled Dick, with stretching, to rest his body on the extremity of his toe, though I could not touch the floor. 'Who has a knife?" asked the brave little boy, looking up into our faces with -resolute eyes-eyes that were of unearthly brightness, as if lighted prematurely with the glory of the unseen world.  "I have one in my left pocket," I answered, through the tears which my excruciating torments forced from my eyelids.   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.   41 No one can tell, but he who has been hanged by the thumbs, the mortal agony I endured each instant. With a great deal of exertion he got to his feet, and took my knife from the pocket and opened it. He then pushed -a box under the beam, climbed on it, and, reaching the cord, cut it and .brought me to my feet. With the knife held in my left hand, I myself cut, the other cord, and I was free. Who can describe the sensation of pleasure which this sudden release from pain caused in me? My first use of my liberty was to give Dick his, and as both his feet touched the floor, he fairly howled with happiness. A faint voice recalled us from ourselves to our liberator. He had sunk down on giving me the knife, and lay with his head lyng across his bent arm. "Good-bye, Berry-good-bye, Dicky-I am dying now!" "Oh, no, Billy, don't ye," blubbered out Dick. "You shall live and be happy; shan't he, May? We'll work for ye, and fight for ye, and love ye, and nobody shan't hurt you, if you -won't die." "Give me your hand, good Dick-and yours, Berry,' he said softly. "Good-bye. Dont forget little Billyi Dont cry for him, but smile when you think about me, and say little Billy is happy with hi mamma in the sky. Kiss me, Berry. Kiss me, Dicky. Let me die so!" And we kneeled one on each side of the poor little sufferer, about to be, a sufferer no longer, and each held a little cold hand in ours. The hand I held grew colder each instant. The light of the' large hazel eyes which he fixed, on us became fainter as the day fades into twilight. He -had for some minutes ceased to speak, his head lying easily oni my knee. All at once a bright living light came into his eyes, and diffused itself over his fea- tures in a smile of inexpressible sweetness. "He sees Heaven," sobbed Dick, and a globe-like tear fell from his eye upon the by's forehead. His lips moved. "Good Dicky, you love me, don't you?"  )   ..     42  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. Dick blubbered aloud and hugged the hand he held, like a huge Newfoundland dog licking the hand of his dying master. Another glorious smile mantled his face. He half raised him- self up, and with eyes shining like stars of heaven, he exclaimed, ^"I hear such sweet, sweet music, Berry! Oh! I see the angels, dear Berry Look, I see my mamma! I am coming to you in the sky, mamma. Little Billy is coming, mamma-ma-- ma-ma-"' With that dear name upon his faltering tongue, the poor little work-house orphan boy ceased to live, and his bright spirit was carried by angels into the bosom of his mother and up to his God. It was an awful moment to us two little boys!-Dick rose to his knees and turned his eyes from the lifeless body towards Heaven, and looked earnestly, as if he expected to see the as- cending soul in its flight. He still held his hand. I released that I had held, and placed his head upon the cot, and we crossed his little hands on his breast. He is dead 1" said Dick solemnly, " little Billy is dead! I wish we could die too, Berry'; for it is so easy to die. He saw angels and his ma." Dick then began to weep. "We must not cry for him," I said. "I am glad he is dead! Didn't he want to die Come, we must let them know it. 'Go down and tell them, Dick." The idea of the additional punishment we had exposed our- selves to by being cut down, never entered our minds. Death had given other things a precedence and importance, compared with which we felt our relations to our tyrants as culprits had no consideration. Without a word, Dick went down the stairs. I hearf Shirkey shout out at him on seeing him, and was making towards him with an axe with which he was cutting wood, wher Dick said in a calm, solemn manner, that surprised and over- awed him, "Come up stairs, sir, and see little Billy, he is just dead!"

He now turned to reply to me, with a flashing eye, when his wife checked him, and said-               ,  "BS-h! don't be imprudent, or you may repent at leisure. Boys, you may come down," she said, in a tone of softness by which she had never addressed us before; "you must be fright- ened to be here.

'  Skinner stared at her as if he thought her mad. I saw he winkaat him and go s-h! He then kept silence, and followed us down. We went after her into the oakum room, where the rest of the little wretches were hard at their picking, save one, and that Neely. I saw her lying on a trundle in the woman's room the door being open. She was awake, and smiled, a return at the look of; sympathy I gave her.  "Come, children," said the old hypocrite, -affecting a tone of great kindness; " come, I have a surprise for you! I've 'alterec my mind about the cakes, and you shall all have them again but only one at a meal, coz I want them to last'you three meals Youi are dear good little children, and I love you all very much and if we punish you sometimes, it is for your good. But- hopes we won't have to be called upon to whip again very soon!' "-"What in the devil's name are you driving at, woman?" asker Skinner, whose thicker brain could not take in her policy. "Come here," she answered, sharply, and led him into th text room, where Neely lay quite forgotten by them, who over heard and afterwards told me what they said. "How skull-headed you be, Skinner!" was her first addres to him on getting him into the room; "don't you know th unlucky death of that boy is going to get us into a lifficulty i we don't manage well?"   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MATBERIti.  A 45 Who cares for poor-house brats alive, or troubles themselves to ask after them dead!" he' answered,: sullenly.

Mr. Skinner Shirkey highly approved of the sagacious and discreet policy of his wife, and promised to follow it in all its particulars. As we were not let into the secret until sqme days afterwards, our surprise was not a little drawn upon when they came back into the room, for Mr. Shirkey's first step in :hs new lesson was to approach DiCk and offer to shake hands with that young gentlema n in the mostfriendly way conceivable; but the O latter, quiite unaccustomed to an yadvances from that quarter that were not associated with pain, dodged, anticipating covert; attack. Mr. Shirkey, however, being fully aware of this weakl- ness, and the causes of it, wyas not by any means disconcerted, but smilingly: said,  '"Won't you shake hans land :be friends, Dick?" "How?' interrogatively ejaculated the still doubting boy "I say shake hands,- Dibk. Dick, who. shad probably neveir shaken hands. with anybody before in his born days, made a gyratory motion with his left paw, like the forward movement:of a tortoise's fore-fin, and Mr. Skinner, taking hold of it, shook; it up and down with a hearti- *ness that was edifying to all the little girls aid boys Who' were looking on. He thien'extnded the same sign of peate to me, and I shook ,hands with him, but with :a loathing that I could not overcome or account for-as such condescension on the part of our tyrants ought to, and at any other time previous to this eventful day, would have filled our little hearts with joy. He went round and shook hands with every little boy, each of which trembled for fear it was a "catch," and would end in a "hit" about the rhead; in- a word, each one of ius felt pretty much as we should have done had M ister Skinner been a bear, who, hitherto growling, wickedrandi dangerous, suddenly walks up to us on his hind legs, and offers his paw -with .agrimace of' amity.    "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.    4 ' Having gone the rounds of the boys' hands, he returned t the place whence he had started, and cast a glance at his wife for her approval. I saw this lady nod her- head with amiabl affirmation (for I afterwards understood the meaning of thei signs, glances, and nods), and then approach the little gh nighest' to her, and stoop, and with an air of the profoundeE affection, kiss her dirty little cheek--a novel act. which sh achieved in spite: of the struggles of the child, who very evi dently fancied she was going to take a bite out of the cheek She thus went through the little party,; smi' ig and kissing) an a very nice time we all had of it, with such condescension as i all wa .

Wouldn't they ol1l the work-house a swes little paradise?" The amiable gentleman addressed expressed his decided opinio that such-would unquestion bly be the precise appellation whic the supposed visiters would bestow upon the place.

So we sat apart, and did not tell them about it, knowing they would know it soon enough. Shut- ting the. door in upon us, our tyrants, so suddenly changed to making pets of us, left us. While the rest were playing, Dick and I secretly watched the proceedings out in the yard, for we. wanted to see what was to be done with little Billy's corpse. At first webheard a dull sawing of boards, which lasted some time. It was then followed by a nailing, which sounds grew at every nail hollower, till it recalled the sound of the fall of earth on my mothers coffin. Dick and I both spoke in the same solemn whisper of awe, "He is making his coffin P! Wet now watched still more eagerly, and soon after beheld Mr, Skinner come out of the shed, carrying on his shoulder -a deal coffin made of rough boards. He ascended the stairs to the gar- ret with it. She soon followed him. They were gone about a quarter of an hour, when we saw him descend, bringing little" Billy in his coffin. His wife held one end of it. They carried it into the shop and there left it, coming out and looking the door. We now told all the children what we had seen, and when they heard of little Billy's death they all ceased play, and cried for him with all their little hearts; for we were poor, friendless child- ren, whom a common lot of wretchedness bound together, and we sadly missed any link struck out of our little chain; besides, the idea of death was appalling to us, as it is to all children. They drew closer to each other, and feared--they knew not what. At length when, just before dark, Mistress Shirkey entered and told us in the mildest voice that our supper was ready, 'we followed her and stood round our table, if two long greasy boards, laid upon a pair of wooden horses, can, with justiceto the character of legitimate tables, be thus denominated. " Our eating-room was a narrow, dingy apartment, with unpainted wood work, falling plaster, broken sashes, and no fire-place: a cold, shivering hole-inwinter 'There were: but two chairs in   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PEROIVAL MAYBERRY.    49 it, one at each end, for the overseer and his wife; as for us child. ren, we stood about the table, the boys'facing the girls; indeed, as'for seats, we never sat down, unless on the floor or a block of wood, or perhaps a candle-box. Our meals were two a day. In the morning, after having been called up at the earliest light and worked four hours, wC had our breakfast, which consisted of a tin cup of water, corn meal bread, and salt fish or salt beef. This breakfast nevei varied, except Sundays, wlien instead of corn-bread we had mush salted. We went from table to our tasks, and at five o'clockwr assembled in the same room for. supper. This meal consisted of corn-bread, and salt smoked herring, and a cup of sweetened water; but on Sunday, for the latter, watered -milk was substi tuted. Of this food, such asit was, we had as much as we could eat, provided we were not above fifteen minutes at any meal After supper we returned to our work, which was either picking oakum, carding sheep's wool, picking seed out of cotton, or othe! like work common in work-houses. Our present supper was a new evidence of Mistress Shirkey'i resolution to secure our friendship. We had a hot hoe-cake fresh milk, and some apple sauce, with our other half of sweel cake. But neither the splendour of the fare, nor the smiles of the hostess, had influence enough to make one of us forget dead little Billy, nailed up in his coffin and locked :up in the, shed.' I seemed to us like doing some very naughty and cruel thing t eat and enjoy ourselves, and his place vacant among us. So we stood about the table a sad company, and were soon afterwar. sent up to bed. But it was long before we could get to sleet for talking over, in mysterious voices, the strange events whic!

Gradually we all fell asleep.. I dreamed of the beautiful Anne. Early in the morning I waked up, and found Dick already awake: and seated by the dormer window, which looked towards the east- ern sky, which was all in a rosy glow, with delicate suffusions of purple, orange, and gold. I watched his face. - It was a very common face, but had a thorough stamp of honest, plain good- nature upon its freckled features. He looked refiective, and his imall blue eyes were fastened thoughtfully upon the splendid apparelling- of morning. A single star, like a drop of liquid gold, trembled yet in the blushing sky, the only link between the fly. ing night- and the advancing day, which was soon to absorlb it into its ocean of light, as the spirits of the just, when the night of life endeth, are received into the bosom' of God. "What are you thinking about, Dick?"I asked, as I approached him, and gently laid my hand on his shoulder, for since the events of yesterday we felt like brothers to each other. "I am thinking of God, May," he answered, without turning his head or moving his eyes from the magnificence of?the eas. "I am seeing tim paint the sky.

"I think I do, or else it is a sweet kind fade I have dreamed about till I think it's my mother," I answered, sadly. I then t1tofd l: how I recollected her burial, after which I had been jioced in the work-house. O .o. ..   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.

Dick then turned back, and reached the yard and his gar undiscovered. He had not been in bed since. Children as we were, and ignorant of all the world beyoz our walls, we could not then understand the wrongfness. whii marked this imidnight 'burial. We did not oince questiom:  ,.             /.  ,        ,  v-- ,' -  ,     52  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. right to bury him when and where he chose; but it made us sad, and filled us with awe, to talk about the silence and dark- ness in which he was laid in his last home. "It is a sad thing, May, to be a poor-house charity-boy!" ejaculated Dick, with-a shake of his head; "I never felt it so bad as now." "What is a poor-house-what is a work-house, Dick?" inquired I, eagerly---for I had heard these words used for the first time on the previous day, and under circumstances that awakened my curiosity; for I had an inquisitive spirit, which daily was becoming more active and earnest in the search after the knowledge of things, as Emanuel Swedenborg has it. It is a place where the poor folks and their children are put to work when they can't get work out and about. Orphins as hasn't no mothers nor fathers, nor nobody doant own, is put in work-houses and poor-houses, and is supported by the county, and has to work to pay for their livin', as we does here. If we had fathers and mothers, and housen to live in, May, we wouldn't be orphelins like, as we is, but live in our own housen. Nobody goes to work-housen as can live anywhere else, coz they sells us out to the lowest'bid."  Light and intelligence flashed in upon my mind. My often inquiries of myself, recorded in the first chapter of this my biography, were, now answered. -I at once and clearly under- stood my position. I measured at a glance the immense gulf that lay between a work-house boy and the lovely, rich, generous Anne-the angel of my ideal heaven. I felt how low and degraded I was. My blood tingled. My pride was touched and humbled to the very earth. I saw the secret of Shirkey's cruel power over me and my fellows, for we were the off-scourings of  the county, friendless, uncared-for, a burthen and a curse-the county's adopted children, sold at auction to become slaves to ;the, tyrant master whose skill and talent in starving the oor enables him to bid lowest for their blood!

Be coula boil us and eat us,i he pleased, as he daily threatened to do; he could whip us t -death and bury us privately by midnight, and no one would as after the fate of the county's slave! It is one mouth, one bac less.  "Dick!" said I looking him full in the face, as the sunrie was lighting up his head as with a halo of glory.   What, May?" "You said those only come here who can't live in the world. "Yes, May"  Then I don't remain here another day, Dick," I answerec with the'spirit of independence struggling at my heart-strings. "Won't ye, May?" he cried, striking his hand suddenly int mine, while an enthusiasm such as I had never before witnesse shone in his eyes. Are ye in right earnest?" "I have decided on it," I replied, resolutely. "Then there's two of us, lad. I've been thinking about th very same thing, and I thought I'd like you to go, too; but was afeatd, as you be two year younger and littler, you couldn' get a liivin' by yourself."  "Yes I can," I answered!"I won't sleep in this garre again. Let us run away together .to-night?" ":Well, we will, May. It's settled as if we'd: had a hour' talk. Don't let's say anything, but keep quiet and work hard bein' it's our last day. I'll be pesky sorry to leave the other but I guess the old ones 'll treat 'em more kind; if they don'i we. can tell 'em we'll let folks know what we know." The awakening of the rest of the boys now separated us. A] that day we were treated with marked attention. Little Neely who was better, had a soft bed laid in the picking-room, an Hetty was allowed to sleep with her. That night, after suppei both Dick and myself were taken very sick, and vomited hard with severe pains in the head. We kept our beds ten days, an every day were visited by Shirkey or his wife, who professe     54  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OP PFRCIVAL MArftltRY. great sympathy for us. At length, after three weeks, we were well enough to resume our intention of eloping-a resolution which has not once left our minds, It was Sunday night we fixed for our departure, because Shirkey. was generally more tipsy on that night than usual, and his wife retired to bed earlier. As we went in to supper, Hetty, whom we had made a confi- dant of our plan, whispered to us not to drink any of the sweet- ened milk; for, said she, "they put powders into your supper before, I know, to make you sick, to keep you froQn goingsaway and tellnganything."- This had been also my own suspicion, not that they were aware of- our intention, but, like all guilty persons, they feared every- thing, aid hatched all sorts of suspicions nd sa the possibility of our getting out and unfolding the tale of Billys foul death, occurred to their minds, and led them to resort to sickening pow- ders to make sure of our silence. WWe ptobmised Hetty we would heed her warning, and, although we:were pressed by our amiable mistress to drink freely of the milk, we complained of a fear of a return of our old complaint, and so got off. She looked daggers at us; but I have no idea that she suspected our intentions; my opinion is, that she intended to drug us systematically every three weeks; and so keep- us incapable oft leaving our garret to betray them. At dark we all went up to our room to go to bed. .All was soon quiet in our apartment of the garret, every little boy soon falling asleep on his hard' cot. Dick and I lay quiet, and wide awake. We could hear the girls talking in their room for some time after our bed-fellows Were silent with sleep. At length their prattle ceased, and Dick and I softly got up and prepared to steal off, according to our previously-settled resolution. It was a star-light night. Venus hung low in the west, and the seven stars were rising with Orion beneath them. It was the   "F AND ADVENTURES OR PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. . night of the eighth of August, 1813,-- a night ever to be remem bered by me. We had nothing to take with us, for our iolyedlth; consisted in the biothis ire' had in, and ; h- a comptneoiibn at wearinig them away, lest we should be said to have :solenh th, o;. We haid, however, taken the precaution to put by, from mal to- eal,:bread and fish, till betfeen usiboth we had at least a-weeks provision.? I had also safely secired' in the lining df ': y boarse jcket the half dollar which the lovely Ainne had given ,me,ejbutiwhich I resolved to part with only in the last;extreniity. eKlk's wealth consisted in-two coppers he; had come by, and a jack knife, his gray jacket and trowers,-shirt-we hid none--aid aan old cloth cap.

We could darkly see' the roofs aid towers of the dis- tant town; a town, though but a mile off, we had never visited' but towards which it was our determination, on getting without the enclosure, to direct our steps. We ouild' also4'tiigtaidsh the river beyond, by the stars wibh. it refieetei on itsmlni  bosom. Still as we kept ourselves waiting till after thn 'cloo tiei we knew Shirkey and his aife would be in 'bed, Het-ty fiheard our whispering. She had already, with Neely,.bn sBent back to 'the garret to sleep-for, as days went on and thw 'thi death of little Billy more remOtte, the -confidence and courage of our two keepers increased, and in the saome proportion their civility and amiability towards us decreased. Scolding, ear-boxing, whipping,ad h ad shtlowanee, -had resumed their natural cur- rent, and tasks were as rigidly exacted as before. Hetty, who, as I have said, was aemarkably elever girl of thirteen, and who could be trusted, had been made by utishe ewtffidi&nt- f our pro- posed flight. It was at Dick's puggestion that shemwastold of it; for she seemed to liEk aii&"'fo,:hi Wi tui^iaid good heartiaid he thought a great deal of her o"n his tiar. She :nw called softly    56  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. to us through the partition, saying that she had something she wished to give to Dick as a keepsake.  "I'll throw it over-but you must catch it," she said, "for if it falls on the floor it will make a noise., You Mmustn't open it for three days, Dick!"  "No, I promise, Hetty," answered Dick. "But doant ye throw it. -You can reach it over to me if I get up on a barrel." So Dick mounted the head of a barrel and received the gift, and, as he afterwards confidentially revealed to me, a squeeze of the brave girl's fingers, which he averred. went to his very toes. Itwas tolerably heavy for its small size, and Dick guessed it was "Coppers;" but his honour forbade his prying too closely until the time should come for him to open and see what it was. At length we heard the far-away clock of the town strike. We counted stroke by stroke till ten were given. We then said together.: "Now let us go!" "Good-bye, Hetty," I said, putting my lips close to the par- tition. "If you was only a :boy, we'd take you too." "If they treat me bad, I will go in my turn and take Neely with me. But I will stay for little Neely's sake." "Good-bye, Hetty, and dod-dearn Skinner, if he lays hands on you to hurt you only let me know, and I'll whophim." "Where'll you be, .Dick, for her to let you know?"I asked, with a smile, well aware we neither of us could tell where we were, to sleep even the next night.  Wull, rll come back here when I get rich, Hetty, and rll make you all happy, as chickens in a corn-patch--won't I though?" "Come now, Dick," said I, "it is time we were off. Make- no noise, and let us go as soft as cats. You follow me. Have you got the rope?" " Yes," he answered, "and the iron bar too!"  'Then come," I whispered to him., "We are going now,   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY    5 Hetty," I added to her. If you see Miss Axne again, nve breathe to her what we've suffered on her account." "No," she responded, cheerfully; ":but I'll tell her how 1feam tiful and,good you think she is!" I blushed and was pulled along by Dick, who had' opened:th garret door. Closing it slowly after us, we mentally said good bye to our sleeping companions, and descended the, teps I took the lead. On reaching the yard we kept along close under the wall, until we came to the corner farthest from the, house, and at a point where I intended to climb over. We were as still a death, for we feared not only arousing our tyrants but the wake fulness of a ferocious bull-dog, which Shirkey kept as a guar to the premises. This dog we'knew usually frequented the fron of the grounds, though he had free circuit all over them, CHAPTER   II.. THE night which we had selected for our escape was, as have said, clear and starry, so that moving objects could be dis, cerned without much difficulty by a clear-sighted person. Shil key had eyeslike an owl, and we used the utmost caution nc to be seen, should4 he by -accident be 'up and at his window which overlooked tihe yard. Dick did not, however, so muc fear his eyes as the dog's teeth, and hurried to; make ready t mount the wall.  To effect this escalade, we had' brought a part of the clothes line, to ones end of which I had tied a: heavy iron bar, which had been used to secure a basement trap-door.

I no sooner saw him on the top, than I followed, and had just time to draw up my feet under me as the huge dog made a spring at my legs. An inch lower, or a second later, and I should have been torn to pieces.

An old field, called the commons, surrounded the work-house, and across this we took our flight, with our hearts, as it were in our hands. In thed darlness we fell;one after the other into a gully, out of which we scrambled to pitch into A hole ihalf lfiI of water. B:;it these mishaps were trifesl, and-a scarely detained us. Our only idea was-to place as wide a spaee between our backs and the work-house wall as possible. We could :hear              t   "FE AND ADVENTURES OP PERCIVAL MAYBERSY   65 the angry and continuous bark of the dog as if he knew he ha seen something more than shadows to bark at, and we bent oiu ears as we fled, to see if we could catch Shirkey's teirible voie mingled with the baying. "Let's run faster, Berry," urged Dick, as he panted befor me. "He'll miss us and open the gate, and let the dog-after us.' This idea was horrible to me, for I well knew the blood thirstJ nature of the animal, and added wings to my flight. All at once Dick disappeared. We had run near an old lime-kiln in the eel lar of a burned house, andthe had pitched down into it. I stop pod to' look for him, for I could hear him "dod-darning" h1 luck.  Are you hurt, Dick?"I asked. "Can you get out '" for- could see only a heap of white. "I an't broke nothing but my head, Berry. Give me you hand and help me out," he answered.

At a glance I saw that we had lost our way, for .the town was on our left, and we had been running from it. But the dog. could 'be heard coming on nearer and nearer, and there was no time to lose. Encouraging each other, and sometimes hold of hands, we ran for our lives,  Directly before us were a couple of tall posts, crossed by a beam, full fifteen feet froti the ground.. The sight of it made ns both stop and stand still with suierstitious fear. It was the gallows! We had been familiar withthe sight of it for yeairs from the window of our garret, and once we had -Seen a pirate hanged on it. The wind caused a chain, that was suspended to it, to swing and-creak like a cry of anguish. "It's the gallers i" ejaculated Dick,' grasping my arm and holding it fast. "Let us go round it," said I, scarcely more courageous in 'sraci a presence than my companion. Thiere :was, however, a third party to the fulfilment of this ,.deterhiniatifon, and this party was baying upon our rear, and not fiftjr yds from uis, and lessening his distance each instant with fila  bounds.  There was no alternative, I -saw at :a glanoe, ' it eith er to fall into the teeth of 'the dog, who seemed "to howl for our blood, or climb the gallows; for feinc, or tree, or shelter of any kind, there :was not anywhere in that desolate place. 't We must chiihb the gallows, Dick! You- take one post 'and - I will take the other." - - The devil 'll catch us on it, May, and hang us," he answered, with decision. ' Ill pull foot -for it!' "sAnd I'll climb,"' I answered; and the same moment was Shinning up the square post. I was sdooniten feet from the -ground, and ,so rejoiced with a sense of safety, that I forgot the terrible instrument to which I owed it. ' Dick-, seeing me climb, paused -an instant, equally balinced Mhis mind between the-,dog and the gallwi, When the d'angerous ioibity of 'the former led him t embrace the esfety 6ffeed by- -de latter. Ih' in istasnt, he was at the very fop, .perched on   the transverse beam. At the same moment the dog reached the foot, and began to fly first at one post' and -then at the other, springing and reaching full six feet with his terrible paws, while he roared like a lion robbed of his prey. This was rather a novel and perilous situation for two little boys to be placed in. It must. be remembered that I was scarcely eleven, and Dick but thirteen, and that we had only our natural courage and native wits to help us in this emer- -gency, and every other in the future. The world was that night  . "All before us where to choose.-   Without friends, without a known relative, -without experience, without money-at least with only half a dollar and a few cop- pers-flying from the house which, should have been a happy orphan's home to us, and from, a man and woman who should have been a father and mother to us, we had not only our good Ito seek, but evil to avoid. Hope had nothing bright before us, and vengeance was behind us.  When other more favoured children were safe in their warm beds, and sheltered by a father's roof, we were out on the bleak commons in the dark- ness, compelled to seek refuge upon a gallows (the very idea of :which makes children shudder) from a dog whose half-blood- hound race rendered collision with him as dangerous as with a tiger. In the distance, too, in the direction of the work-house, from one of the windows of which a light gleamed, we could hear Shirkey's st, --st, st! seek 'em, Buith tear 'emi, Bull!'" showing the equal danger ,that would befall us if w'e fell into his grasp. He held, a lantern inl his hand, which, by its motion, betrayed his movements, and showed us that sometimes he was running and sometimes standing still,-as if listening, while oat intervals his sharp hiss to the dog would reach our ears, .making our blood run cold. "Haint you skeered a bit, Bery?" asked Dick, interrupting me from one end of the beam, while I sat astride of the other.      62  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. "I feel pesky frightened being. up here. I believe we shall never get down alive! Don't you see some'at like a skull in that chain?" "They don't let 'em hang here, Dick, but buries 'em at the foot o' the gallows there. There aint nothing to be afraid on, here, half so much as that ugly dog yelpin' at us," I remarked. "It's a pesky skeary place, enny how, and if I'd a big knife, I'd rayther get down and fight it out with the dog. My hair sticks right out, I'm so feared we'll see some ghost!" This was spoken slowly and solemnly. "I'm more afraid of the living Shirkey, who is trotting over the common this way," I answered. "I wish we had some way of getting rid of the dog, for he'll lead Shirkey right to us!" "The dog'll stay down there yelpin till mornin'; the kritter never gives ennything up it once fastens on. Shirkey'll have to catchus!"- "Not if I can help it," I said. "Look! He has stumbled and fell, for his lantern is rolling on the ground, and it's gone out too! Now so much the better for us, coz he may not be able to see us." "I hope he is afraid to come near this gallows," said Dick. "He's a bad man, and bad men an't brave where ghosts and hanged folks be!"  If he an't afraid we'll make him," I said at once, an idea coming into my head. 'As I have said, the night was starry, and objects on the open common could be seen with remarkable distinctness. We could see Shirkey's dark figure advancing as the dog's voice led him along, and we knew if he could see the gallows he could see us, and that there would be no escape for us. I communicated my plan to Dick. He at once embraced it as our only chance of safety from the peril which menaced us. He immediately crept along on the beam till he reached the middle of it, and then swung himself, with some superstitious reluctances it is true,   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.   6 upon the chain that hung from a bolt in the centre, and which had been used to hang criminals "'in chains" in former days. He had no sooner left the beam for the chain, than I followed him and fastened it beneath his arms, and then gave him a swing outward. All white as he was, from head to foot with his coat borrowed from the limekiln, when he tumbled into it, he looked ghost enough to startle anybody. Even my. own fears were moved as'I beheld him, and my blood ran cold to my fingers' ends. Thus much for Dick in his part of hanging ghost, and I had great confidence in the success of our stratagem, knowing that Shirkey must have a bad conscience, and therefore must be superstitious. How to conceal myself was the next considera- tion, and this I had already planned. :I lowered myself down by the chain, slid over Dick's shoulders, and dropped exactly behind him, so; that his body effectually hid mine from any one advancing from the quarter by which we now saw Shirkey coming on.  As I hung thus behind Dick, I congratulated myself on the ingenuity of my plan, and did not have a single thought of mis- giving but that it would prove thoroughly successful. It was a moment of suspense to us both. The dog first showed signs, of perplexity when he beheld us take our pendent positions from the beam. He ceased to bark, and establishing himself beneath us, raised his mouth and began to howl in a most dole- ful manner, enough to appal stouter hearts than ours; indeed, enough to startle Shirkey himself. -I had heard the same dog howl at the moon, but on this occasion he surpassed all pre- vious performances of this description. Dick grew nervous, whispering to me, "That he knew the dog would turn into the black-horned Satan and devour us." But for my part, appalling as his howling was to my ears, I was glad he had substituted it for barking, for while he had kept barking sharp and gamesome, Shirkey advanced steadily; but I noticed that his step faltered as soon as the howling began. 5*     "  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. Nevertheless, I saw him still slowly approaching, but evidently with hesitating steps.: At length I could distinguish his white shirt bosom, and he at the same moment must have discovered the whitey form hanging between the pillars of the gallows, and slowly swinging as if in the wind. He stopped and seemed to be surveying it; and then came on further and stopped again. Fearing his courage would increase at each step forward, and fully satisfied that he had-' "seen something," I, with the true tact of a child, and with that intuitive knowledge of human nature which is one of the characteristics of childhood, uttered a low, faint cry, in exact imitation of the voice of dead Billy. I was a good imitator; and my success was so perfect, that Dick, to whom it was unexpected, shook with terror, and said,. gaspingly, "It's little Billy's ghost!-he's. settin' on top the beam i" ' You mur-der-ed me  Mur-der-er! come-and-see where-you- will be, for you mur-der-ed me!" The man stopped. I saw him stretch out both hands as if adjuring the spirit that addressed him. He then groaned, and half turned. His dog howled more dreadfully than ever. I uttered a piercing, revengeful cry, that would certainly have ter- rified any midnight traveller who heard it. As for Shirkey, he echoed it with a hoarseness which fear added to, and fled from the gallows like a deer, howling as he flew, while his dog, seem- ingly catching his master's consternation, darted after him, yelp- ing as if he had been pursued by invisible whips. 'After -the overseer's form could no longer be detected, we heard the tread of his feet, which dying away, were replaced by the echo of the loud shutting of the work-house gate behind him. Hle's safe," I said, breathing a relief breath. "And so be we," responded Dick, electrifying me with a hoarse laugh. "If he ain't scared this time, he'll never be; and dog, too. Didn't he yell and leg it! We makes a capital ghost, Berry; I the whitin' part and you the groanin. Who'd ha' thought it! Now, let's be off, and we'll laugh and talk about   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.-  65 this to-morrow. Crawl up again on the beam, for you be pesky heavy, Berry." . / I relieved him of my weight, and the next minute we were both on our feet upon the earth, and in prime spirits, forwe had achieved a 'gallant victory over, in our estimation, the most for- midable man on earth. Our courage and confidence rose in proportion. We now turned to quit the gallows which had so well befriended us, and which we both had ceased to regard longer with -super- stition. Indeed, I glanced up at it and to the chain with kindly feelings. "We can't get worse shelter than this, Dick," said I. "For 'the future, whatever shifts we are putto for a night's lodging, it will be an advance on a gallows, that is certain." "Which is .a werr comfortable reflection," observed Dick  drily. "Now, let us be off. Take care! don't step-on thad grave, Berry. It may be the pirate's." I sprung aside as if I had trod on fire, and went round a little mound, of that long and narrow shape which designat man's last six feet ofi earth. I walked round it with a feeling of awe. and having once more taken the dir9ction of the town we resolved to be very careful not to wander from the was again. In the midst of the town was a very tall, black tower and pire which we could see by the star-light, and this we kept in F ight Pursuit from behind we n longer. feared; nevertheless, we di not slacken our pace, but rather trotted than walked. Whei we had fairly left the dark commons behind us, and had reached a fenced lane that led to town, we began to feel our sense of secu rity very greatly increased. The lane led between small cottages and had a gavyelled side-walk close by the white palings that enclosed tht i. their green yards; but we kept the middle of the street, both to avoid the barking curs, whom our footstep awaked, and because we had no idea then of the uses of side-walks having never walked on them. Indeed, we had neither of 'i     "  LTFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. eer quittd the premises of, the ' poor-house," since we had been first placed there-I at six years of age, or thereabouts, and Dick at seWen. We had no recollection, or knowledge, therefore, of what towns and streets were, or of anything else beyond our daily experiences within the walls of our prison. In a word, we were ignorant of everything but picking oakum. We had never been to a meeting-never heard a sermon -nor a prayer. Dick did not know how to read, and I should never have learned if I had not been taught before I went there, an accomplishment which not four of the poor children there possessed in common with me. This talent of reading I had preserved; not by means of boks, for we never saw them, but by means of scraps of news. papers that had come wrapped about parcels, and which I preserved with the most scrupulous care, I was enabled to keep up the prac- tice. I could not write; but having a talent for drawing, I could very closely imitate print, and often wrote my name in charcoal on a new board in this printed fashion. Darkness and ignorance, tyranny and cruelty, hard Work and hard fare, were the chief features of the establishment, which for some fifteen little orphans 'had been substituted by the county for their paternal homes. We tramped forward, with but two paramount ideas in our minds,-one to reach the river, and the other to widen the dis- tance as rapidly as possible between our heels and the gates of the WorkA house. The town was situated on the western bank of a beautiful river, with green shores interspersed with wood. lands, and about three miles from a broad bay which was visible from the dormer window of our garret. Many an hour of the long unsanctified (save by the release from toiD Sabbath have I sat in the recess of that roof-projecting window, and watched the vessels sailing up and down and across the bright blue bay in all directions, and of all sizes and varieties of form. In a clear day, I could detect a sail leagues off, looking like a little white speck, and [ would watch its slow advance till it began to take form and dimen- sions; and. I would follow its course, its masts seen above the shore   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.    6 of the river and tops of the houses, till it anchored opposite the town How I loved to wonder about the unknown lands they came from, and the wonderful isles in the sea to which they went when I saw them fade away into the azure distance of the horizon! Oh! strange and wild and adventurous ideas the sight of these white- winged voyagers of the sea created in my soul, and gave a direc- tion and colouring to my hopes and desires. I would lovq, too, to gaze at the turrets of the college, and the spires and towers of the churches, and drink in the symmetry and beauty of their never-changing outlines; but I delighted most in' the motion of the vessels, and-their ever restless movements, as if they were living things. As I went along the first street that entered the town, there waS a floating notion, half formed, yet there in my mind, that if I could gain the river I should be not only safer, but find some field of action congenial to my soul's panting for the future. As to Dick, he seemed to have no distinct idea ofanyiypurpose of action. He had no predilection for anything, that I could ever learn, but for driving a stage.' He had often expressed his admiration of the eoachman, who every evening, just before sun- set, drove the mail coach past within sight of the work-house into town. He used to express himself very warmly at this sight, and say, of all persons to be envied it was the driver of fours such fast horses. Indeed, he cared little for the vessels, except on a Fourth of July, when he would see them decorated. with their gay flags. Thus our tastes, suchas they were, were quite opposite in their objects; yet, so far as liking each other went, we had but one mind. At length we got to the end of the pretty lane, and came to two streets, wide and handsome, with tall houses. We kept to the right, and holding the centre of the way, did not intermit our diligence until we found ourselves in a large open square. Here we were bewildered. We had no idea where we were, but fortunately, looking up in the airy I recognised, towering above us to a great height, the twin towers of the college buildings.    68.  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. I then had a sure guide, for I recollected which way the river lay beyond them. We at once crossed the square, and finding another street opening on the opposite side of it, we ran down it at full speed; for we had caught sight of two men in the square who called out to us.. We looked upon every person with suspicion, and only flew the faster. They did not, however, pur- sue us, and we took breath. The street we were now in was very different from those we had passed through. The buildings were compact, without fences ortrees before them. It was a business thoroughfare, and, descending, led to the water-side. I soon caught sight, in the gloom, of the masts of vessels, and pointed them out to Dick with great joy; but his attention being at the same moifent fixed upon a stage with lamps on each side of the driver, rumbling through a cross street, he did not heed me. "There's a stage, Berry! Let's get on top of it or up behind it, and ride." "Where, Dick?"I asket.. To Boston. It's going to Boston, I dare say." "Let's go in a vessel, Dick. We'll get there sooner, and here's plenty o' vessels down here." "I'll go just where you do, Berry," answered Dick, "but it would be so jolly to have a ride on a stage."' While we were talking, the stage came rattling by, and the two lights flashed so broadly in our faces that we were blinded. It was crowded with passengers, and the boot behind piled with trunks. It stopped a few houses; up thelwater-side street, where we had seen a man standing, holding a lantern in his hand. We watched from the corner of the street the stage stop there, the passengers alight and go in, and the trunks being removed, and then saw it driven away out of sight behind the tavern. "It has just come in and not going out, Dick," I said. Come, let's go down to the river. See the tall masts peeping over the stores. It will be so nice to'sail in one of those white-winged schooners we have seen so often on the bay looking so pretty."   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL ,MAYBERRY.   G "Dod! so it would, Berry. Let's go and get into one on 'en coz I'm pesky tired and sleepy though, and 'd like to find som place to lie down." As I was also sleepy, I led the way without delay down narrow alley, on one side of which was the water, with vessel lying close to the alley. This was indeed a wharf, though then did not know it to be such. It was with difficulty we coul get along. The tall stores upon it cast dark shadows, and th way was choked up by tiers of barrels, hogsheads, cables coile in rings, anchors, grind-stones, barrels of tar, and spars. W got more than one fall in the groping darkness; but we persE vered until we reached the end of the wharf, where four or fiv vessels, large and small, lay. But as the tide was up, the side of the ships rose so high out of the water that we- could no climb up into them, which we should certainly have attemptec if there had been anything to lay hold of. But we admirel greatly the dark grandeur of the ships and the loftiness of thel masts, which, to our imagination, touched the stars, and Die] began to feel, as he confessed, that a ship'was a finer thing thai -a stage-coach. It must have been now about half-past twelve o' clock, for w had heard the clock strike twelve before we crossed the towi square. All was quiet save the ripple of the tide about the bow and rudders of the vessels. We felt strangely in so new a situ ation, and saw so many odd things that we were sometime frightened, and at others filled with admiration. In particular an Indian warrior dimly seen on the bow of a brig, early pu our cowardly legs in motion, for we took it for somebody lyinj in wait for us; for Dick, who was older than I, and knew more had told me that, as we were county orphans, the whole count: would be after us, to take us again, as soon as our escape go noised about. It was this consideration that made me so anxious to get at once into some vessel, so that I could leave the cit3 and country at once.      70  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. We soon reached a flight of steps that descended to the water. At the bottom of them I discovered and pointed out to Dick three or four " little ships," as I called several gigs and yawls which were tied to the stancheons and rings in the stair-head. These little ships filled me with admiration. I had never seen anything like them before; and, as for Dick,he was for getting down into one of them at once, and going to sleep, as he could hardly keep his eyes open, he felt so sleepy, he said. We carefully descended the broad steps, for they were wet and mossy, and perilously slippery, and got into the nearest boat. It was dry and clean, with seats and a smooth floor. On the stern there were cushions and a carpet. Altogether, it was a very inviting refuge for two wandering: boys. DblSk at once crept-under one of the seats, and saying he was too sleepy to hold his head up, laid it across his arm, and in a minute was fast asleep. As for me, though tired and sleepy with being up so late, and having gone through so much, I had more caution than my companion, and the fear of recapture overcame my propensity to yield to the temptation to repose. I had no idea of the exclusiveness of personal property. I had no idea of rights beyond the right of possession, for, as I have said, I had had no moral or religious training whatever. I believed I had as good a claim to use the boat as the gallows for safety; and so, in order not to be pursued and captured while I was asleep, I resolved to release the boat we were in and push it out into the river, so that nobody could get into it. Acting on this mental siggestion, I untied the painter which secured it to the stairs, and pushed it away so as to clear the other boats. Run- ning my hands quickly along the piers of the wharf; I caused the boat to glide sternward swiftly and noiselessly, till, unable to reach any pushing place longer, I let it move of itself until its momentum carried it quite clear of the head of'the pier. I could see the open river above and below, and the stars shining down into its bosom all around me. My sensations on finting myself   1   LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERC1VAL MAYBERRY.    7 in a boat, and floating thus between heaven and the air, away from the solid ground which I had never left before, were full of awe, delight, and strange fear. I sat down in the stern of the boat upon the soft cushions, and gazed around-me in silence. I felt a sense of security that was gratifying,' for I knew that Shirkey could not trace me beyond the shore. I soon saw that the boat had motion, both 'outward towards the middle of the river and downward. This was -caused by the first ebb, upon the 'top of which I had' launched my adventurous bark. Slowly the boat glided past the wharf-heads and past vessels at anchor;. but no one hailed us. Everybody at that hour seemed to be asleep. The clock of the city suddenly tolled one. Its tones crossing the water, startled me like a voice in the air. The stroke was answered by smaller bells -from vessels at anchor around me by two strokes; and from one ship came a clear, manly cry-  All's well!" The star-lit skies reflected on the river; the shores. which seemed moving, and not I and my boat; the silent and dark-look- ing vessels at the piers; the ripple of the waves as they- met an obstacle---all were sounds and sights so new to me, that I seemed' to have been transported from earth to another planet. At length I fell asleep in the stern-sheets.   I was awakened by a shock and noise. I started to my feet and found it wag- daylight, and the sun just rising, out of the horizon of the sea. It was a moment or two before I could recall myself to myself, and realize where I was and how I came there. But an instant was sufficient to bring to my memory all that had transpired the preceding night, up to the moment of my falling asleep.. I now saw what had awaked me with such sudklenness. The ebb tidehad drifted the boat down the river and out into the bay a mile, and directly upon a ledge of rocks, that I had seen often from the work-house window, lying along upon the surface like     72  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF?.RClIVAL MAYBERRY. a huge serpent, and coal black. The boat had been borne with some violence against a rock forming nearly the westernmost link of the chain, and nearly capsized with the force with which. it struck. I looked around to rouse Dick, but he was missing! For a moment I stood amazed. I then began to look under the seats, and examine as closely as if I were looking for a lizard, for nothing but a thing as small as a lizard could have been con- cealed in an open boat. I called to him--      . "Dick! Dick! where are you?"Ithen looked over and peered under the boat, and yet he was nowhere visible. He could not have got out upon the rocks, for they were sharp and steep, and could not have held a goat. I was. therefore satisfied that my companion had fallen overboard in his sleep and been drowned without waking me; I saw something upon the bottom of the boat. It was Hetty's parting gift, which he was to open only on the third day. I knew, then, if he had left that behind, he had fallen overboard and was perished. I would not open the parcel, resolving that the three days' delay should be as sacredly respect- ed by me as it would have been by Dick, had the poor lad been alive. Having made up my mind that he was dead, I sat down and began to cry right heartily. I loved him because he was so good and faithful, and thought so kindly of me. I pitied him that he should die, and by such a dreadful death, just as he had escaped  from the work-house, and begun life free. I then cried because. he had left me'in so lonely and friendless a condition. So long as I had his company I was comparatively happy; but now I was indeed alone, and without a friend on earth!. After I had given myself for full half an hour to my grief for the mysterious loss of Dick, and my own loneliness, I began to dry my eyes on my sleeve, and to look about me. The boat had drifted away from the reef, And was once more riding gently upon the ground- swell out in the bay, which was so full of islands, and so land- locked, that it had the appearance of an inland lake, save at its south-eastern extremity, where it opened into the illimitable   "FE AND ADVENTURES OR PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.    73 ocean. One of these islands lay directly in the course which the tide took, after releasing me from the reef of rocks, It was about two miles from the shore, rocky and wooded, with green sides sloping about a cove on the western extremity. Upon one extremity were the gray ruins of an old fort. There was no sign of habitation to be seen. jjNearer the boat swung towards it, Vhd I saw, not without satisfaction, that. I should be drifted upon it; for I was, now anxious to get on land, as the narrowness of the boat cramped me, and I did not like to be in it since poor Dick had been drowned out of it; it gave me a' feeling .as if I were left to sail in his coffin. I knew that on the island I should be safe from any pursuit from Shirkey; and that if I found no peo- ple, it would be so much the better for me, so long as I could get berries to eat and water to drink. This reflection begat in me a; desire to find the island without people, for the fear of my species had taken hold upon me; as in my childish ignorance I fancied that'as much uproar would be stirred up by my escape from the work-housei as if I had been a State's 'prisoner or a criminal. Secrecy and concealment were, therefore, my first wish, until the search for me should subside. There were four oars in the boat, with polished metal bands on them where they played in the row-lock, and the row-locks themselves seemed to be plated with silver, and shone in the morning sun. The tiller was inlaid with rose-wood, the seats cushioned with lemon-coloured satin and fringed, and a rich rug lay in the bottom for the feet to rest upon. The whole of the interior, as examined by me by the light of the day, was rich and beautiful in the extreme. I also discovered a little box' or drawer, under the seat, which I found locked The oars I knew not the use of, nor could I have used them to be of any service to me. The boat was, therefore, wholly com- mitted to the mercy of the waves, which, however, bore it along gently enough, for I was swung from wave to wave like a child rocked in aa cradle. I now gazed about me with wonder. The sensation of being. upon the water for the first, time made- my pulse throb with joy and awe. The sight of the distant land,     74  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. the green islands, the vessels moving to and fro, all fiXed and pleased my attention, and made me for a moment forget the loss of poor Dick. But whenever .the thought of his death flashed upon my mind, I shed tears bountifully; and a sense of utter loneliness pressed heavily upon me. BAt length the boat was carried close under the island on its northern side, and I expected it would soon touch it, and enable  me to land; but the current sheered off from the rocky shore, and went sweeping round it with considerable velocity, carrying me and my boat with it; so that, although within a few feet of the island, I was 'borne by it, and unable to reach it. I now began to be alarmed lest I should miss it, and be borne out to sea and perish for want of sustenance. The boat having raced along the shore on the current, was doubling a rocky point- passing which it would have taken me beyond the island-when I caught up a pole with a hook on one end of it that I just dis- covered in the bottom of the boat, and with it caught hold of a bush that grew from a crevice in the rock. I fortunately got a firm and fast hold, and although nearly drawn into the water, I clung with my legs to one of the thwarts, and held on till I turned the boat's head and pulled it in from the current so as to shelter it behind the rock. I then caught the rope in my hand, and leaping ashore, tied the boat to the bush, I felt happy enough at standing once more on the solid ground, and delivered from the danger of being borne out to sea. The sun was by this time an hour high, and, shining bright, and smilingly upon sea and land, made me feel cheerful and full of hope. Having seen that the boat was well secured, I left it, and climbed up the rocks to the top of the bluff under which I had stopped. I soon stood upon it and looked around.- I saw no signs of habitation. There was a still higher eminence, green and  inviting, nearer the centre of the little island, to which I directed my steps. I moved along carefully and watchfully, for fear of I surprise. I fancied nothing less than lions at least dwelt there,   "TFE AND ADVENTUREtS OF rPERCIATL MAYIBRTrY.  75 and if I had seen one or two elephants browsing on the foliage of the trees, I should not have been at all surprised. Latitudes and climates, and the animals peculiar to eoch, I had n9 k.9iw- ledge of; and it was therefore very natur l, too, that ]X sAulj look for savages to peep at or rush owtu .upnme freow W*MhA every rock. , Strange, wild, exaggorwteed tles. of adtn t:I i travel in various parts of the world, had coie to my eare ^ji through chance books or newspapers, which I had got hold o, or the in-bed stories of my companione. But as to th dimeiou sions of the world I had no distinot ilea. It smene to ma t be flat and bounded by the horizon; whioh I beheld haut Ui itl view from the garret window of the poor-houae. Armed with a stout stick inone hand add & god-aixed bo*O in the other, as defences against wld beates id eannibal, I took my wayto the top of the hill. .i was a :SmOoth, grim well in the centre of the island, with a single oe tl  staiee ing upon the top in majestic solitude.' At its base were green patches interspersed with copses. Altogether it was I;ety;, .eidued spot. The vale sloped, to a narrow cove on the soath elide, shut in by high rocks, which bordered it tlke the jaged: ia 'o a basin.  I reached the top without aeeing any liet or i. I ma,: *d looked about me. I could, at a glanee, take itn tho ehle extent and forn of my island. It was about a third ef a mbie long, a quarter of a mile wide, and nearly OVal in bhapl: Tbb highest portion of it was the centre where I stood, whiic was probably one hundred and twenty feet from the level of th beach. - Part of its shore was rocky and steep, but on the eastern eide its grassy surface descended to the water smooth and re'ular'y like a lawn. On the south' side were a great many treQs grOw- ing thick along a bank, and almost dipping their btanehes into the water. These trees extended some ways about the lftie rocky basin overshadowing it, and giving it a seclusion that;re. dered it shady at noon-day; and as the entrance was very narrow, 6*     76  ItrwiAN ADVENTURES OF PEkCIVAL MAYBERRY. it could hardly be seen by a person sailing on the outer side that the basin was there. Having surveyed these peculiar features of the island, which in my imagination was at the world's end, I looked off ahd around to see what I could discover. To the north I beheld the. mouth of the river out of which I had drifted in my boat, for I recognised it by the spires of the town just faintly visible beyond, the distance to the town from my post of observation being nearly two leagues.; Letting my eye wander along the main shore, I caught sight, far in the interior, of the roof of the work-house, the very sight of which made me feel as if Shirkey's eyes were there fixed upon me, sothat I involuntarily hid behind the trunk of the'oak, feeling safe only in having it between me and that dreaded home of the orphan. It was some minutes before I recovered from the shock of surprise and alarm which the sight of that place had caused me, and could continue my observations, all the while nervously keeping the tree between me and the direction of the poor-house. The shoresof the bay were, in all their semicircular extent, from two to three miles distant. They were mostly wooded and wild, with here and there a farm or fisherman's hut, or perhaps a white house of more pretension. The two arms of the bay- shores, after making a circuit of five or six miles, terminated a mile from each other in two head-lands, one of which was crowned by a light-house, the other by a red wind-mill. Between these two prominent objects was the entrance to the bay, a mile in width, and communicating with the broad expanse of ocean. The whole scene was varied by vessels moving upon the water, soWe just coming in, others spreading their canvas for a long voyage, and others lying off the mouth of the river waiting for the flood-tide to convey them up to the town. There were also fish- ing-boats sailing about with one sail, which was shaped like a leg of mutton, and also boats without sails pulled by pars. But   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAAY'ERBY.   " these were at a great distance, and looked like black spiders creeping upon the smooth surface of the bay.  I now better understood my position, and began to reflect upon what I should do there upon that island, which seemed to have no inhabitant, nor no living thing upon it, except a pretty tortoise the size of a man's hand, which I had encoiutered- on my way up the hill, and scampered away from at full speed, not having ever seen one before, and being wholly ignorant of its qualities or capabilities. which I had seen from the boat. It was a circular, green ram- part, with a broken flag-staff standing in the centre. I resolved to go and see that, and half hoped I should find somebody living in it, for my loneliness began to press heavily upon my young heart. I therefore descended the height, and, crossing a sort of meadow two or three acres broad, entered upon a path that led through bushes a little higher than my head, with here and there a scrub oak growing among them. It was a wild, overgrown spot, and looked dreary, and I hurried to get through it for fear of wild beasts. Every sound startled me and made my heart jump into my throat. The path should have shown me that human beings had been there before me, and that I should pro- bably find persons on the island; but the sight of the path suggested to me no ideas of people having made it with their feet, for it seemed as much a part of the wood as the trees them- selves. I soon came to a spring that. was bricked around, but the bricks were fallen into it and tall grass was grown about it. I stooped down and drank heartily from it, like a dog lapping,     78  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBEAR Y. and felt my spirits revived; for, what with hunger andithirst, I had begun to feel very miserable. '1 shall not perish for good spring water, at least," said I; ' now, if I can get anything to eat, then I can live here till Shirkey is dead, when I'll take my boat and go to some great city and make my fortune, and -then ' I'l- go back to' the work-house in my coach, and free all the orphans, and make 'em all happy as kings!' With these high thoughts for the future, I began diligently to look about for blackberries, but I could not find any bushes, nor any other kind of berries. At length I came out of the sort of jungle through which the path led, and found myself in an open space, and in the centre of the place was a long, low building of wood, once painted yellow, but now weather-stained. At one end of this edifice, which was full sixty feet long, was erected a cupola, on the top of which was a pole, at which were flying two torn strips of what had formerly been a yellow flag. The roof was broken by winds and storms, the windows shattered, and the door hanging by one hinge. Grass, rank and tall, with all kinds of abominable weeds of foul odour, grew around it. Altogether, it was a desolate-looking place, and the sight of it somehow chilled and terrified me. It stood, as I have, said, solitary, in the centre of a'cleared place, and woods encircled it. Above the trees,-a little distance to the east, I could. see the broken flag-staff of the fort, to which my destination had been. I stood looking at the building for several minutes, without advancing a step from the path which had conducted me to it. I felt as I did when I saw little Billy dead, and as I did when I awoke and found that Dick had fallen out of the boat and was drowned. It was a sensation that the presence or idea of death alone can awaken in the soul. I listened, but all was silence. 'Death, indeed, seemed to reign there in undisputed gloom. The very sun-light, which, shone- brightly and cheerfully upon all other objects, fell, as I thought, upon this spot with a baleful and sickening glare.   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVTAL MAYBERRY.   79 At length I gathered confidence, and, actuated by curiosity to see what this building was for, I boldly crossed the space that separated me from it, wading through the damp high grass. As I walked, I stumbled at every other step over unseen hillocks under the grass, and at last tumbledforward at full length upon one. Its long and narrow shape, made out by me as I involun- tarily clasped it in my efforts to rise, caused a shudder to thrill through my frame. I sprang to, my feet, and looking round, 1 saw that I was surrounded with such mounds: that I was in a place of graves-a horrible and solitary golgotha! With the wings which fear lent me, I flew across the intervening space, still leaping from grave to grave, for the spot was sown as thickly as a furrowed field with them. I had to pass close to the long deserted building, which, in my imagination, seemed to me to be a gigantic coffin filled with corpses, which I should see glaring at me through the dark windows if I turned to gaze. A skull and i the bones of a human hand which lay half exhumed in the way I was running, were not wanting to complete my terror. I leaped overthem with a cry of agony, and, with my hair stand- ing on end with mortal fear, I reached the top of the hill on which stood the old fort. I did not feel myself safe until I had scaled the grassy sides and stood upon the parapet, with the open skies arching protectingly above me, and the broad blue bay smiling around me. It was some time before I recovered from the shock which I had received-and if any of my readers are inclined to smile at my cowardice, they must remember that I was but a poor, helpless, ignorant lad of eleven years. As I stood upon the parapet, and after I had in a great degree recovered my self-possession, a sense of my utter loneliness and helplessness came over me. I sat down upon a broken gun carriage in an embrasure, and shed tears like an April rain. I almost wished myself-back again under Shirkey's tyranny. Imourned for dear Dick, and almost accused myself of his death. I was filled with despondency, and having nothing to eat, I had, no prospect biefor- me but starvation.' at length laid my head     80  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. upon the cold iron gun, and, in accents that would have softened it had it feeling, I said I wished to die. Grief, however, like all fevers, will run out, and when I had run through the whole gamut of complaints and murmurings, I ceased crying and sunk to sleep upon the gun. I dreamed of the beautiful Anne. I slept till late in the afternoon, for when I opened my eyes the sun was near the western horizon. But another object besides the sun greeted my vision.! It was the form of an old woman, tall, gaunt, and strong, with eyes like black diamonds, and hair as 'gray as silver wildly hanging over her brows, through which she was steadily looking at me. Her chin was resting upon a crutch, and her face was thrust forward within three feet of mine. For a moment I returned her gaze with wonder and doubt, not knowing whether I were waking or dreaming. But there was a livid malignancy in her looks that was too palpable for dreams. In alarm, I started to escape from her, when, to my consternation, I found that my hands were fast tied, and my two feet bound to the wheel of the gun-carriage. I was unable to stir. I struggled in vain, and only hurt myself for my pains. All the while the horrid old woman stood still, and with her chin on her crutch eyed me with satisfaction. She looked to me like  a tigress in human form, who, having got me into her power, watched me as a cat does a mouse before getting ready to eat it. "Oh, you needn't twist and twirl, little 'un, you can't get loose!" she said, and her voice sounded like a boatswain's with a bad cold, hoarse and shrill together. ( Who be you?"I demanded, half frightened, but the other half indignant. "Irll tell you by and by, little.'un," she responded. "If you'll go with me quiet I won't hurt you; but if you is trouble- some, I'll drag you by the heels." "Where do you want to take me?"I screamed out, beginning to kick hard to break the bonds that secured my feet.  "You better be quiet," she said, and, lifting her crutch, she   JTFE AND AD'ENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.    81 gave me a blow with it over the head that well nigh knocked my senses out., I had enough remaining, however, to see that I was in the power of a dreadfully wicked person, and that she would not hesitate to kill me if I did not do as she bade me. I had been drilled to obedience to tyranuical power, and hard knocks were not strangers to me; so I thought it best to submit, or appear to, to this new authority, though I bitterly groaned that I should only have exchanged one condition of bondage for another, two tyrants for one who seemed to unite in her single person the. -wo-fold evil natures of the former. "P'll get up and walk if you untie my feet," I answered with angry feelings, but trying to conceal them from her, lest I should reel the weight of her crutch again. Without replying, she stooped and released my ankles from the thongs which chafed them, and I at once stood up. If my hands had not been tied behind my back, my first impulse would have been instant flight, for I felt confident then in a direct race I could get the advantage of her and keep the lead; but the result will, by and by, show that I calculated without my hostess. The cord which she had taken from my feet she tied by one end to the thong which secured my hands, and theother she fastened to an old leather belt, which had once been a soldier's, for it still retained the brass breastplate, but rusted and battered. Her costume also partook partly of the military character, as. she wore an ancient trooper's helmet without the horse-hair; hind- side before, and a red artillery waistcoat was pulled on over,her gown, which was open at the bosom, if the broad space of Tbrown (k- , wrinkled and unsightly, which she freely displayed, could  us designated.  surveyed all these particular features of dress and person while she was tying the cord to my hands, and my sentiments of respect for her were by no means increased by the result ,of my  :observations; but I feared her the more the more I looked at her. She seemed to me an awful giantess--a sort of woman- '  '      82  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.  waror or dragoon-woman--terrible and awful in whatever aspect I regarded her; but with my fear of her was mingled detestation, and a resolute purpose of giving her the slip the very first oppor- tunity that presented itself. I was now fairly a prisoner. But I was used to hard usage, and bore up far better than many an older lad, who having been brought up in luxury, should have fallen into the same hands. I Was, moreover, naturally of a sanguine temperament, and alWays inclined to look on the best side of everything, with a cheerful hope of something better by and by. Therefore, I re- dbliect, fthat iii the midst 6f my monrtifidation at finding myself in the pWbiEt ,of the ogress; t cheered my spirits with the thought that she might after all have shtiething t o eat;, for I was becom- ing taeUlliouiy hiintgry.

All at once I came full -i ight of the open space, the long, old, yellow building, and the rank golgotha of the monumentless dead. I stopped full,   "FE AND ADVENTURP ES F PEtCIVAL MAYBERRY.   83 and when she yelled for me to go on, I pointed eloquently to the graves! "Go on, I tell ye! Ye an't afeard o' dead bones, be ye!" and down came the cruteh with three successive blows upon my shoulders, till I danced and roared with pain. The living behind was aore, terrible than the dead before me, and I leaped for- Ward. But I was checked all standing, and turning towards her to knot what I was to do, she pointed to a path on the right, which wound round the lonely burial-place, and led towards the building. I took it with reluctance, but there was no retreating. She pushed me on before her with her crutch, and my super- stitiouts fears were mastered by those more tangible and apparent to my bodily sense. We reached the east end of the building, and as the path wound round it I followed its angle, and found myself behind the house and directly in front of a shed or cabin half built of stones, and half formed out of a bluff hill-side. It was in the rear of the long building, and about six yards dis- taut from it. The space between was marked by those hillocks wad hollows that tell where dead men lie. The path led straight over these to the door of the cabin. I leaped the graves, but I noticed that she tramped alog -right upon them. Oh, what a horrible creature I thought she was! Directly in front of the door lay a dog that looked like a famished-wolf. He was asleep when we came up, but our steps awakened him, and he no sooner fastened his eyes on me than he flew at iMy throat. I was saved from instant annihilation by my activity, which enabled me to place myself immediately behind- the ogress, glad even to get such shelter in sucoh an emergeney. A sharp word from her lips cowed the dog, if dog the beast was, and he crouched down and eyed me savagely. But she made me go past him and I was snapped at by him as I did so, for which notice of my heels he got a faint blow froi the woman. "Now pull the string and the door'll fly open,' she ye' t ot to me             --     8"4 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. I pulled a greasy knot that' hung down in front of the door, and it swung open, letting me into a wretched cabin of one room. I shrunk back as I saw three skulls over the fire-place grinning at me, and cross-bones placed each side of the hearth.' "In with ye-in with ye, little 'un!' she called out to me, giving me a push that pitched me nearly into the face of one of the skulls. "Now set down there," she added, pointing to a box. I obeyed her. She then released the cord from her belt and tied it to a' staple in a beam, and thus securing me, mur-  mured,  "I guess you won't get away from that!" I, however, mentally resolved I would get away, and that night, if possible, and find my boat and escape from the dreadful island in it, indifferent, so long as I left it, where I wandered about. "I wish you would give me something' to eat, and then tell me what you want with me?"I asked, with some resolution. "Eat! You're hungry, be you? Well, you must earn yer vittles afore you eat 'em. I'm goin' to play queen and be idle now, and you must work for me and yourself too. You wiant to know what I wan't o' ye! Well," and here she laughed hor- ribly, "well, I want to make ye my slave! I'm gettin' old, and want some light young body to do for me and give me rest. So, you see, when I seed you asleepin' in the old fort, and see as -how you was ragged and poor, I resolved to make you mine. So I dropped my bundle o' sticks I was out gatherin, and come home a'ter strings, and went back and tied you. Now, you see what you are here for! I mean to make you work-make your hands and your feet do for my hands and feet. If you try to run off, I'll kill you, and hang you up to dry in my chimney corner, as I would, a weasel. Now, shall I keep you tied, or will you swear to me you'll serve me and not run away!" "I'll serve you as well as I can, marm, if you won't keep me tied!" Well, then, I'll let you go loose; but look ye! Come here   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.    85 Hell!"As she spoke, the wolfish-looking dog, large and gaunt like his mistress, came into the hut and sat himself up on his hind legs and looked her first in the face and then me. "You see, Hell," she addressed the dog, "you see this boy'!"The monster showed his teeth. "Now, I want you to keep watch on him, do you hear?" The monster howled. "You'll al'ays go out and come in with him, and if he runs you'll fasten on his windpipe!" The fiendish and well-named animal then leaped towards me in literal fulfilment of her command, and Iwas only saved from his attack by a shrill yell from the woman, which showed the dog he had misunderstood his mistress, and had been a little premature in his devotion to her commands. . "Not now, Hell, not now, beauty, but when you find he means to play me false, and give me the slip. 'You'll then fasten him to the ground." The dog snarled, and crouched at her feet, with one docile eye upon her, and the other, fiery with hatred, fixed upon me. I now felt created within me a horrible detestation and fear of that dog. The sentiments I entertained towards his mistress were amiable compared with those which the dog impressed me with. I felt as if I could murder him on the spot if I had only some weapon wherewith to attack him. As it was, I made an undying feud with him from that moment, and I do not flatter myself when I say, that he had 'quite as much, reason to fear me from that hour as I had to fear him. There was a look of diabolical intelligence in his hideous, hairy face, that somewhat intimidated me, and made me regard him with a certain kind of respect. He seemed to have quite as much of a human soul in him as his mistress; and onee it occurred to me that if they should exchange bodies for a time, the woman's in the dog would make him much more deservingof his appellation, "Hell," than he now was. Such were the characters of the two living beings in whose power my misfortunes had placed me, and who were to make use of me for their own will and pleasure. The apartment in which I was was not large, and had bare walls of timber and plank, the     86  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.' roof sodded and long with grass, which even grew downward through the crevices. The rear of the cabin was the smooth dirt side of the cliff, in the soft soil of which were scooped out several little holes or shelves, in one of which was a broken tea-pot, in another a pipe and some tobacco, and in a third a heap of dried fish in a broken platter. At the bottom was a larger and deeper hole, which seemed to lead into darkness, as if a vault were exca- vated under the ground. From the rafters above hung dried  herbs of all kinds, herring, salted fish, and old garments; but what astonished me most was a vast quantity of all sorts of cloth- ing of men, and women, and children; coats, gowns, and petti- coats, soldiers' jackets, sashes, belts and boots, and hats, caps, and pantaloons, all more or less worn, and arranged with the order of a well-supplied slop-shop. At least, thought I, here is enough to eat and to wear. The sight of the fish reminded me  of my hunger; and pointing to the herring, I said, sullenly, "I ha'n't eat anything since yesterday--give me a herring!"  ( No working no eating," she responded. "You must eairn youi' bread, urchin," she said in a very positive tone. What shall I do?"I asked, r6ady to undertake any reason- able task to have any prospect of subsequently appeasing my hunger. "You'll go to the fort--you know where that is?" she said, interrogating, and yet affirmatitely. "Yes-4 suppose it is where you tied me," I esponded, in the ainiable mnanner of a little bull pup out of humour, though I tried to answer pleasantly, knowing that good-humiour would advance me more in favour with-her than sulkiness. It was jist there," she classically remarked. ' "Now I want. you to tramp back there, and pick up the bundle o' sticks I dropped when I seed you asleep on the ground-for it an't often people gets to this island-nobody comes if they can help it." "Well, I could'nt help it!"I responded. "We'll ask you about this by and by. You go first and get -the bundle and bring it here, for how can I cook my supper with-   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.   87 out the dry sticks? When you've done, that you shall have something to eat." As she spoke she pointed to the door. I went out of the door at a bound, glad to get into the open air, and off I started at a run in the direction of the fort. I had not more than turned the corner of the old structure, that had looked to me so. much like a huge coffin, than I suddenly resolved I would not stop running, eat or not eat, sticks or no sticks, until I had got round the island to where I had tied my boat in the morning. But I happened to cast my eyes over, my shoulder to see if I had left my tyrant far enough behind me to make the experiment of flight, when I stared full in the face the monstrous dog, who was loping after me at a long limping gait, exactly like that of his mistress. His tongue was out, qnd his eyes glared on me with savage intensity of purpose. - I saw at a glance that flight was all up with me, so I resolved to submit with the best grace I could to my miserable fate. In order to see if the dog was acting only as a spy, and not pursuing me to do me a mischief, I slackened my pace, when he did the same. If I quickened my run he did the same, and if I stepped he also stopped, and constantly preserving the same distance from me, which was about five yards. "Very welD Mister Dog-fiend," said I, "you awd I w going to be great friends, I see. But you must take care of your hnd- some face, or I shall be apt to spoil its beauty.- The animal seemed to comprehend the spirit of my words, if he did not understand the words themselves, and snarled fero- ciously, looking as if, had he not been restrained by fear of his mistress, he would have taken the utmost satisfaction in tearing me in pieces and eating me. I soon reached the fort, and, after searching about, I found the bundle of dry pine sticks, and putting them on my shoulder I prepared to return. , But before I id so ast glance around me. I could see several snow-whie barks moving up and down the bay, and the evening sun shining upon the towers of the dip- 'tant town, and even reflecting from the roof of the work-house.     88  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.  As i gazed upon the latter, I sighed as I thought how little I had gained by my exchange in the last twenty-four hours. I felt that Shirkey and his cruel wife were more endurable, if Dick was only alive and with me there again, than this soldier woman and her fiendish dog. I still had two tyrants, and was without the sympathy of the presence of my companions. I thought then of the beauteous Anne, and tears filled my eyes at the reflec- tion how much she would pity' me could she see me now! -As I left the fort and walked back to the cabin, I was busily forming schemes for flight; -and I said in my heart, that, if I could once get away from the island, I would try and find her out, and per- haps she would take pity on me and intercede for me with her mamma to get me a home. But I had no sooner let such a thought enter my mind, than my independence of spirit rose at the very idea of being indebted for relief to the compassion of one whom I almost adored, and whom I wishedlever to think of me with that generous sympathy which she had so beautifully shown when she first beheld me. The piece of iced cake which she had given me I still kept in my jacket pocket; and hungry as I was, I had no more thought of eating it than if it had been her miniature. It was a sacred memento of her, perishable indeed, but perhaps, there- fore, the more dearly cherished by me. I had some hesitation in crossing the graves on my return, and was making a circuit out of the path around them, espe- cially to avoid the exhumed skull I had before seen, when the dog made a sudden advance and placed himself, with a menacing growl, directly in my way. I had half a mind to dash him to the ground With my bundle of sticks and regain- my liberty, but I feared he had a charmed life and could not be killed, and I should be the sufferer. So I turned quietly back into the path, and pursued it until I reached the cabin. Here the ogress received me with a smile of joy lighting up her sun-browned-and gipsy features, a smile that the conscious- ness of having a slave to do her bidding' and ease her of her toil, called up.   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.   89 "So, you are a useful 'un, I see I Ah, it was a blessed hour  laid eyes on you sleepin, in the fort. Lay down the bundle there, and then take this flint and horse-shoe and strike fire. No supper without work!" "I don't want to have a cooked supper," I answered, "I'll eat a herring!"  Don't you speak and say what you'll have. You are mine, soul and body, and I'll make you do as I wish. Strike fire, and kindle the wood!" She spoke so fiercely, that I went to work to try and elicit sparks from the two hard substances; and, after at least ten minutes, was finally successful. With the pine splinters and knots which I had brought, I soon had a fire blazing on the huge stone hearth of the hut. When I had achieved this, I got up and asked her civilly what I was to do next; for I had made up my mind that she intended to burn me alive on the fire I had made, a thing Shirkey had often promised to do for me, and I determined to be as civil as I could to her, in hopes I should avert her wrath- ful intention. "So," she growled, "so you can speak civil if you've a mind! You may now take that fish and broil it; and there's some corn- meal mixed to dough; take a handful of that, and put it flat on that piece of iron." I obeyed her with alacrity; and, without waiting for the fish to be cooked, I snatched it from the fire when her back was turned, and commenced devouring it. I did the same with the cake. All the while the monstrous dog was crouching on his haunches, eyeing me enviously, as I were robbing him of his in- dividual and hitherto uninvaded rights. While I was feeding my hunger, the old woman, for whom, at every mouthful I took, I felt increased good-will, was employed in pounding some burnt coffee in a stone mortar that looked like an apothecary's. Having pulverized it, she poured it into a coffee-pot and placed     90  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PFRCIYVL MAYBERRY.. it upon the coals, first filling the vessel up with water, which she poured from an oaken bucket. The coffee was soon done, and she poured into an earthen cup a large soldier's allowance, and drank it off witlqut Mugar or milk, and seemed to relish it with great gusto. She then offered some of it to me in a broken saucer. I had never tasted this common table beverage, and it seemed to me both bitter and unpalatable; and I made wry faces at it, and told her I would rather have water; for, recollecting what Hetty had said about Shirkey's wife putting a potion into my mug at the work-house, I feared that this decoction was intended to put me out of exist- ence. The old hag laughed, as if pleased at my wry faces, and remarked, in a way quite social,  "I al'ays takes a dish o' coffee at supper. It's meat and drink to me, boy-meat, and drink, and sleep, boy!" Here she looked at me from between the matted gray hair that hung over her eyes, giving her the aspect of a wild- beast, to which the glittering light in her eyes increased her resem- blance. I sat opposite to her upon a box. There was no table between us, she being seated on a low, three-legged stool, and sipping her coffee from her knees.-' On her left hand, like "a familiar spirit of evin," lay her Cerberus, his red eyes fixed immoveably upon her with every sip she took of coffee, and every mouthful of fish she crammed down the horrid, snag-guarded cavern of her jaws. At length I finished my meal, having, to do her justice, had as much given me as I'could- stow away. I now felt in good humour, and certain peculiarities in my new mis- tress, which before had excited my fears, now only awakened my mirthfulness, especially the formidable helmet, the warlike belt, and red waistcoat, to say nothing of a huge pair of dragoon's boots, upon which, at every step. she took, her gown, much too short for her, rested in picturesque folds. The sun was now so low that his beams, admitted through numerous chinks, lay in level lines along the dust within the hut. One of these fell full upon the forehead and cheeks of the   "E AND ADVtNtUREV f 6n P1Iclrc At MAB-trY.  9i old woman, and by the contrasted light and shade into which it threw her features, I saw that they were strongly cut and bold. She looked like a soldier. Her ears were adorned with little gold circlets, and on her long, thin fingers, were numerous (twen. ty-three in all, for I afterwards counted them) gold rings, some of them massive and plain,- others delicate and set with stonus. I remember that when I saw these I thought she must be the richest person in the world, and that indefinable reverence fJr wealth which is' common to humanity, began to find existence in my bosom, and I regarded her with some sentiments of respect. She now emptied her bowl of coffee, and bade me to rise and put it and the coffee-pot away. Having seen from whence 'she had taken them, I obeyed her, and received a nod of approbafic. at my readiness and aptitude to learin. "Now set down there!" she said. I obeyed in silence.

"Now tell me what yi name is?"' e                 , . I was silent, for I feared that the name of "Percivai M:Ayb-ry the boy who ran away from the work-house"/ was known t evty man, woman, and child in the whole earth, and that eveyb;'dy had left their own particular calling and pursuit to malke se&irch after me in particular. I wastherefore embarrassed what to ansrier her, in my dread of being at once tied again and sent back to Shirkey, whom I feared worse now- than I did my present mi-- tress, for whom I began to have less fear than at ftrSt; though,' with reference to the dog, my original impressions had undergone no change, nor were likely to do so.- "You have a name, urchin?" she demanded in a loud toix  that made me jump .   .            -  "Yes-myname is Berry--"'    '    -  "Berry, Berry what--it in't Blackberry?"  '    '     92  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL ,IAYBERRY. "No, marm, Mayberry-Percival Mayberry," I answered, with desperate courage, resolving to out with the truth, and always having an instinctive horror at falsehood in any shape. I had no sooner repeated my name, than she grasped me by both wrists and fixed her eyes upon me, as if she would look me through the very soul. I shut my eyes instinctively, to exclude the terrible and searching gaze. "Mayberry! Doo you tell me the truth? Is your name May- berry--Percival Mayberry Tell me the truth!" "I do, marm," I answered, thoroughly surprised and alarmed at the: effect my-name had produced upon her, referring it wholly and singly to the appalling certainty that she, with all the world, had heard of my flight from the poor-house, and now recognised in me that celebrated runaway. My first impulse was to jump up and run, for I looked for nothing less than to be seized upon, bound, and in due time delivered to Shirkey as a captured desert- er. I glanced, however, at the dog in apprehension, when, to my great joy, I saw that he was asleep, with: his head under a bench, which I could throw over upon him and secure him. I had no sooner perceived this opportunity of escape thus tempt- ingly offered me, than I leaped from the box, already in imagina- tion feeling myself in the grasp of Shirkey, and with one bound I was where the dog lay, upon whom I overthrew the heavy bepch. I only stopped long enough for a glance at him struggling under its weight and roaring like seven Satans. -The next instant I darted through the door and ran forit. It was not yet dark, the twilight still giving light enough to direct me in my course. I leaped grave after grave like a deer, but I soon found there was behind me a more practised and longer leaper than I was. The old woman was close upon me, call- ing upon me to come back, to stop, now saying that she wouldn't harm me if I would stay, and the next moment threatening to bury me alive if she could catch me. The last threat only gave me fresh speed, for I directly imagined that the graves,were those of little boys she had buried alive when they displeased her. I   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.   93 ran like the wind, taking, as nearly as I could recollect, the direction in which my boat lay; but fast as I went she came faster in my wake, and a look back across my left shoulder filled me both with terror and mirth, for a more formidable and odd appearance was never presented than that which she exhibited. She took enormous strides every alternate step, pushing herself along with her crutch. Her military boots seemed to have a seven-league straddle; her gray hair streamed behind; her scarlet vest flapped on either side like wings; -her gown flew and fluttered; and her tongue cursed and coaxed. I laughed at the comicality of her appearance, while I trembled at the terribleness of it. Each moment she gained upon me, and as I saw her loping up stride after stride, my courage failed, my strength oozed from my fin- gers' ends, my knees weakened and bent under me, and I sunk upon the ground just as she laid her big hand upon my collar. I expected the descent of the formidable crutch, and bent my head to avoid it; but she neither struck me nor shook me, but spoke in a quiet, kind way, and said, ".You do wrong, boy, you do wrong to run away 1 You needn't be afeard o' me; not you! I wouldn't hurt a hair o' your head, not I! It was dangerous for you to start and run this way, for  the dog might have caught up with you and torn you all to pieces!"  "I an't afraid of the dog," I answered, "I am more afraid of you!"  Well, well! You needn't be afraid0o' me, child! You ha'n't got a better friend' on yearth than me, if you do run away from 'me. You musti love me, boy! You must go back with me. Providence sent you here straight to me, and I'm going to take care of you and be your friend. Come, I will give you a nice bed, and you shall be my son " I was still suspicious; Shirkey had lied so habitually, and his wife had always so deceived us, that I had no confidence in truth. Her kindness so suddenly begotten, seemed to me put on only as a trap to blind me.. But, as I was wholly in her power, and  .                         .     "  LIFE AND ADVENTURES CF PERCIVAL MAYBEftY V as I heard the infernal dog come tearing along through the bushes'with a bay of rage, I had no alternative but to submit, so I answered, "I will go home with you, if you will treat me well, and not give me up to old Shirkey."  "Who is old Skirkey?" she asked; but before I could reply the blood-hound came jumping towards me. I never saw any- thing look so terrible as he appeared. His red eyes flashed with pain and revenge. I thought myself gone beyond rescue, when the voice of his mistress loudly ordered him back; but instead of obeying, the monster snarled angrily at her and made: straight for me. The formidable crutch now came to my aid. Swinging it over his head oice, she brought it down upon his skull with such force and. accuracy of aim that he went rolling- over and over on the ground, yelling horribly, and at last lay as still as if dead.  "Lay there and take that for not minding me," she mut- tered. "Come, young master, go home with me!" I was at once inspired with confidence in her by what'she had done to the dog. I reasoned rightly, that if she would so severely treat her favourite dog to save me, she must really like me better than the dog. I therefore told her that I would go home with her. She took me by the hand and led me along the path I had come. I kept looking back for the dog, but saw him stealthily raise his ugly head and squint after us with ma- lice and rage in his eyes; and from that moment I made up my mind that my personal safety would depend wholly on the ex- tinction of the brute; for if I did not destroy him I knew he would annihilate me. At length we reached the cabin, and she pulled me in and shut the door. Without a word she lighted a' pine knot and stuck it in 'one of the skulls on the shelf' above the fire-place. She then sat down, and made me sit down oppo- site to her. I waited with the most anxious solicitude for the result of these preparations. All the while she looked kindly, so I dismissed fear. She now once more fixed her full search-   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.   95 ing gaze upon me! she extended her hand and pushed the hair back from my forehead. She studied my face asi if it had been a' portrait.  "Yes--he does tell the truth! That is his name!" she mur- mured, as if talking to/ herself. "He has her hazel eyes, her brown curly hair, her arched 'eyebrow, and red lips. His fore- head is like hers, only higher, as will become him when he is a man. The same dimple in the cheek and on the back of the hand! Yes-it is he!"  At thesewords I, began to think of Shirkey and arrest, for I thought she was comparing mewith some description of my per- son that had issued from the work-house in :order to aid in my recovery so natural it is for persons to fancy themselves the centre of the world, and to imagine that everybody is troubling themselves about their affairs. The murderer fancies everybody is in pursuit of him; the ththief imagines all men know whose pocket he last picked; the young lawyer fancies he is the cyno- sure of all eyes, and that everybody has heard of him; the young bride blushes consciously as if everybody knew she Was married yesterday; the' child in her new hat fancies the minis- ter looks at her more than at the rest of the congregation; and the poor little wretch of a poor-house orphan who escapes from the tyranny? of the overseer trembles, thinking he hears the very birds babble his desertion, and the cocks crow aloud his name; while the tolling of a bell is an alarm to the county. It will not be surprising, therefore, that I should be, so sensitive and on the alert touching my own safety. "Percival Mayberry!" she suddenly called out. "What, marm ^ ILanswered with a jump. "Do you know who you are?" was her solemn inquiry. I reflected a moment as to what kind of reply I should make  to so important an inquiry, but not being able to find any to my satisfaction, I answered, with brevity,  8   ' '     96  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. "How came you on this island? This is a mystery you must  unravel. How came you on this island?" "I came in a boat," I answered, determined not to commit myself, but keep the work-house in the back-ground as long as possible.  "Yes, I dare say that. But what boat? who left you here? who, came with you? you could not have come alone. How were, you asleep on the fort? Now, answer me truly!" "I never told a lie, marm, "I replied firmly. "That is well said, lad, well said! Lies areno doubt bad, if no good comes by 'em! How did you come here? This is an important question." "I was drifted here in a boat. My boat is round the island, now," I answered.: "So much: the better-so much the better," she responded, as if talking to herself.- "' Did you fasten it well?" ,-Yes-to a bush!" ' "I'll see to it. Where did you get into the boat?" "Up to the town."  ' How came you at the town? You must not hold back your answers this way. I'm your true friend! You must forget the licks I gave you with my crutch; if I'd known who you were, I'd not lifted a finger in anger to harm you, not I! Now, tell me all about yourself, as far back as you can recollect. It 'ill be for your good!" I hesitated a moment, and then said,  "Will you not give me back to the work-house again?" Back to the work-house! Have you been at the work-house?" she repeated, with amazement and pity in her harsh looks. "Oh; poor boy! oh, poor mother!" "Yes, I have been there for a good many years, and I only ran away from there yesterday; they treated me so bad." "Treated you bad, did they! Come to me, poor boy!" and she actunlly drew me to her bosom, and kissed my cheeks half a  .            ,     "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.    97 dozen times. "Treated you bad, did they? Let them cross my path!" and she shook her crutch in a fashion that would have made Mister Shirkey tremble, had it been elevated thus above his head.  Encouraged by her change of manner and her undoubted re- gard for me, from whatever mysterious-source it might spring, I opened my mouth and began the narrative of my life from the earliest fact furnished by my memory, and nearly in. the manner I have given it here. When I spoke of the funeral of my mother, I saw great shining tears in her eyes, and when I saw them roll down her rough face and break upon her hand, they washed from my remembrance all the harsh blows from her crutch-al the angry vehemence of which I had at first been the victim. When I spoke of the, beatings, imprisonments, starvations, and uffer- ings I had gone through, shefondled me with onehand, and with the other shook her crutch at Shrkey and his wife, seen by heri with the eyes of her revenge. When I narrated the death of little Billy, her face glowed with indignation. At the account of our escape she exulted and praised me, but when I told; her how I had lost Dick, she looked-sad, and seemed to be-lost in study, as if it could be accounted for on any other grounds than that of falling overboard and drowning; but finally she shok her head negatively, and said with, decision, He is dead!'"     98  LIFE AND ADVn NTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. CHAPTER V. WtET' I had ended my narrative, the old woman sat silently l regarding me for some minutes. Gradually her eyes rested upon vacancy, and I saw she was buried in deep thought. I do not know how long she would have remained thus conversing with the past, if a slight scratching at the door had not attracted her 'attention. I kneW at once that it was the dog, and was not a little apprehensive of the-consequences to myself of his admis- -sion. But instead of opening the door she called to him to "be gone," when I heard the savage go whining away as if he was -hirtabroken, and, as I fancied, burning with jealousy against  Te, 'ho had so clearly supplanted him in the regard of his :-mitress.     ..  Tou have gone through a great deal, Percy, boy! You have had ia hard life, but it's past now! You have shown courage and spirit just as I should have looked for from one of your blood. ?he-toue race will show itself. I shall call and pay this Shirkey a visit one of these days for your benefit! But, in the meanwhile, I will see what is to be done with you! You can't stay here! You say you can read? But this is not enough? You must be educated I You must hold up your head with the best! I will think it over to-night, what'I shall do for you! Now go to bed, for you must be tired.! There is where you will sleep," and she pointed to a corner where a mattrass lay, upon which I threw myself without a second order, for I was sleepy and tired. I had, however, enough consciousness to remind her that the dog and I were not friends, and not to let him come in. This she promised, and said, moreover, that if the dog would not make friends with me she would kill him. It was daylight when I awoke. I was alone in the cabin.   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.   99 The door was fastened without. As I lay down in my clothes I rose already dressed, a fashion which I had been accustomed to in the work-house. While I was looking round' the apartment and examining the strange things it contained, she made her appearance. I scarcely recognised her. She no longer wore the helmet, red waistcoat, or belt, or boots. The former had been exchanged for' a straw-bonnet, under which her gray hair was combed smoothly; for the waistcoat, was substituted a small red shawl, and for the belt a red ribbon. Shoes more suitable to her sex than the boots were upon her feet. I stared at her with surprise and satisfaction. "You don'tknow me, hardly, she said, looking as if perfectly conscious of the improvement in her 'appearance. I do this for your sale, Percy. It isn't often I dress up, for it a'n't often I leaves the island; and when I'm here, as nobody ever lands here, not they, it a'n't no matter whether I dress as a man or a woman." "Why don't people come here?"I asked. "They who come are carried against their will, Master Percy," she answered replying in a tone of marked respect as well as kindliness, that I could not but be impressed with, while I was at a loss to account for it, or for that magic in my name which had turned a cruel enemy as she was to me at first into'a warm friend. "Who carries 'em?" "' Why don't you know this is Pest-House Island?" she answered mysteriously. "Everybody gives this place a wide berth!" "What is a Pest-House? and why are people afraid .of the island? I inquired. 'Well, I will tell you. IYou know, dear boy, that the small- pox is the worst' disease mankind ever had. It spreads to all who touch them that have it. It is most commonly brought in ships from foreign countries, and the city up there has set apart this islnd to put them on. The yellow flag you saw is the sign of thefjplague! and this yellow house here is the Pest House!" "And the graves?"I said, with instinctive shuddering. 8.     100 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. "Are where the dead of the plague are buried! There's many a one lays there I've seen alive breathing God's air! I have seen the Pest-House full of them, laying in rows on both sides, thirty in a row, and dying like cattle with the murrain. But don't look so pale, child! There is no plague on the island now, and hasn't been this year'!" "And why do you stay here?"I asked, gazing upon this woman, who talked so familiarly of death and the plague, yet lived herself.  "I am the nurse of the Pest-House!" she answered, in a sort of professional tone of pride. I drew back a step from her, as if she were the veritable bride of Death, whose every breath was charged with the grave-damp. She laughed, and said with a slight cloud, "Yes, everybody fears Meg of the Island-and you are afraid of me, too!" "No, I am not, good Meg," I responded; "but it is so strange you love to live here!" "People have strange ways of living sometimes, Master Percy. This is my choice; I have lived here twelve years; I am well paid by the city corporation, and have perquisites. It is a grand place for those who are tired of society in the world." "What are perquisites?". I asked. She glanced around the cabin, and then replied, these are perquisites. They are the clothes of those who died of the plague. Nobody, not the nearest, relatives, will touch them, and they fall to me. You see I am rich enough to be a pedlar of wares, if I choose to tramp the country. But I'm no miser! I have money enough for me, at least till you came, till you came, and now I shall begin to think about gold and silver!" My eyes followed hers round the: room, and rested with con- sternation upon the scores of garments, male and female, which she had stripped from the dead. They seemed to my active   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 10 l imagination, to be polluted with small-pox, and to be reeking with plague. She seemed to understand my feelings. "Don't be afraid o' them, Master Percy, they are as good and innocent as ever they were., "It is a dreadful place to be in, with these clothes and the graves all about us, and everybody afraid of the island," I said. It makes it more quiet for me, more quiet for me! I hate people, and love to be here. I was here long before they made a plague island of it! But that is a long story. When they found I would nurse the patients, and didn't fear death, they' employed' me regular, and a sexton, and a doctor. The doctor was a bad man, and his iniquities are buried in the grave with him., The sexton, after burying three hundred in seven years, was buried by me at last. I alone remain! I only keep the dreadful secrets some of the living betrayed, and would have taken to hell with them. I have things, Master Percy, I have papers, and jewels, cases and purses, and things costly and rare, that you shall see one of these days!" "Did they belong to dead persons?" I asked, timidly. "Yes. ' But what is there in that? Everything we possess once belonged to the dead; even the air, and the sky, and the earth we walk on were once in use by the millions of the dead. The dead leave us their verybones!" and as she spoke she pointed to the fire-place, and steadily directed her finger to the skulls. "Whose skulls are them?"I asked, gazing on them with a fascinated eye; for, although I had never seen a skull before I saw these, I comprehended by a sort of instinct what they were. "That one/With the lamp stuck in it is the old sexton's-his whb dug all the graves and buried all the dead about the Pest- House. The large -one next to it that bulges out so behind is the wicked doctor's I spoke'of; for he at last died of the plague and was buried here; the: rain in time'washed out his bones, and I have that to remind me that he is judged at last accord- ing to his deeds." ' What did he do so wicked?'"I asked.  '* e        "'\     102 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBEaRY. "He committed horrible crimes-one of these days you may know. Go and spit upon it, boy! Go and take it down aLdo make a seat of it!" i I drew back with horror.   .  "Do as I bid you! Spit upon it! He was your enemy, and the enemy of your mother! You should learn to hate him."  I advanced to obey her. I had my hand outstretched to lay  hold of it, when the dog sprung through a window and lighted upon my shoulder. I felt ,his hot breath on my cheek, and I should the next moment have been thrown down by him and mangled but for the woman, who grappled with him and hurled him backward with violence upon the floor of the cabin. I seized a knife and leaped upon the, beast, and would have plunged it into his heart, when she caught my hand.  "You must not kill him! I will whip him well and keep him tied." She then pointed to the door and the dog went  sullenly out. "The brute has a soul almost like a mortal," she said. "He knows his master's skull, for that dog was the doc- tor's, and when he died Ihe stayed behind here and took to me. He knew you was about to do something to it; for he watches it to this hour as jealous as if he was alive. You've made an enemy of the dog, Master Percy; but that is no matter, as we shall go from here to-day!" "Go from the island," I cried with delight. "Yes, i'm going to the main and take you with me. I'm going to see what can be done for you. Wouldn't you like to be put to school?" "Oh, yes," I exclaimed, seizing both her hands, "will you put me to school?"  "We'll see, we'll see!" she answered with a smile that made me think she looked absolutely good, if not handsome. A school was an unknown paradise of pleasure I had always loved to dream about when I was in the work-house; and boys who could be at school I believed to be the happiest beings the green earth contained. gr.*   "TFE AND ADVENTULtES OF PERCIVA L IMAYBERRY. 103 , Ohi, you are so good, Meg!" 'I cried. "I will learn so fast and be such a brave scholar!" "I know you will--it is in the blood," she answered. "Yes, we must go to the. main and find you a school. But you must have better clothes, CanX you mustn't call me Meg, but Aunt Meg."    -      .  Be you my aunt?" "Not I! not I; indeed, my boy! But you must be my nephew for the present." "I will call you Aunt, then, or anything, if you will let me go to school!"I answered, with emotions of delight. She now busied herself in looking over the wardrobe of the dead of the plague which hung in the cabin, filling two sides of it, and at length drew forth and exhibited to me a suit of boy's clothes, a blue roundabout and white duck trowsers, that had evidently belonged to a sailor-boy. "These will just suit you, Percy:!" she said, positively. "He is dead, isn't he, Aunt Meg?"I remarked, with hesi- tation. "Yes, and a fine black-eyed little fellow he was too!" "Won't it give me the plague?"I asked. "Well, that is well to look to, well to look to," she answered, deliberately and repeating her words, as her habit was. "You are too precious a prize to be risked. I'll get you a suit in the town, and these are only sailor's clothes. You must have dif- ferent ones," so she cast the suit back again and surveyed my apparel, "What a coarse dress! Have you no hat?, No shoes, neither? Well, we will buy all these in the town!" She then went to a chest, unlocked it, and drew out of it a long steel purse, which was full of gold and silver. I caught a glimpse of other purses and pocket-books, and boxes of jewels. She saw the direction of my eyes, and said, One of these days all these will be yours if you are good, and treat old Meg well. I mean to make you my heir, and so you must look on me as in some sort your mother!"     104  LIFE AND AD]VENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. " "Oh, my mother! Will you tell me about her, for I believe you knew her," said I, earnestly. "Not now, not now; by and by we will talk about her; but there is timre enough. Let us now go." "Here is your crutch!" said I, handing it to her.  "Thanks, good Percy. Ah, it was a blessed day for me as well as for you, you ever drifted on the Pest Island!" She now carefully secured her cabin, but first placed a skull in each window, and one upon the lintel over the door. These keep better guard over what is within than the living," she said. "But there is not likely to be any ohe to trouble my island or my cabin. I could leave all open, and find all safe; but it is best to fast lock to fast find. The dog, too, is a good watcher." This animal we found outside, and keeping at a safe distance. She gave him his orders to remain and watch the house, anda she then bade me direct her to the part of the island where I had landed. The dog would have skulked along after us, but a terrible oath, accompanied by a stone, effectually relieved us of his hateful company. "That dog," said she, "is as wicked, and knows as much as his master! I believe his master's soul is in him; for as them brutes have no proper souls of their own, they must have the' souls of dead people in 'em. That's my belief, and it stands to reason!" "Why don't they talk then?" I inquired, quite ready to be convinced; for having never been taught any religion, my mind was ready to receive any sort of seed. "For the sins they committed when they was men. I believe the doctor is in that dog." We now moved rapidly onward, for she was a fast walker, and reached the shore. By following its windings, I came to the place where the boat lay, which I found still secured to the bush. Eh, eh  a right fine boat for a poor work-house boy to sail a-sea in," she said!"Why, Master Percy, this is a war-ship '   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 105: barge! It belongs to no common vessel. Let me see! Has it a name on its stern?" I could find none. She then asked me to point out the drawer I had discovered. She made no scru- ples to breaking it open. Out of it she took two or three let- ters and something else, which she did not show me. The let- ter she opened and read, and betrayed In so doing the greatest signs of surprise, like a person who has discovered unexpectedly an important secret. "What have you found, Aunt Meg?"I asked. "It is no matter to you-and yet it is matter, but not now- not now! By and by you will see! How odd that you should have been led to take this boat, of all others! Well, things do go strangely in this world. We must sink this boat, Percy!" "Sink it?"I repeated. "Yes, without delay," she answered decidedly. "Stand away, and let me try and break a hole, in her bottom!" She lfted a huge stone, and let it fall with great force. This she repeated nearly a score of times with the most earnest per- severance of purpose, till one of the bottom planks was shat- tered, and the water began to pour in. She then cast it loose, and shoved it, with my aid, far out into the current, first remov- ing the oars, which we hid in the bushes. In a few minutes the barge filled and went down thirty yards from the shore. She watched it till the last of her was seen, and then turned to me. "That boat will tell no tales! And now let me advise you, Percy, to tell none either. You must make known to no one who you are, where you have been living, where you live, how you got to the island, nor anything about yourself. Your name is Percy Berry. 'Do you hear-Percy Berry. You will leave off the May, and never call your first name Percival. Will you obey me, and do as I wish about this?"'" "Yes," I answered, though with some reluctance. "Very well, Master Percy," she added with a more cheerful     106  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF ITEECIVAL MAYBtRBfY. eountenance, "now we understand one another. Come, now let . us leave the island."  "How, now you have sunk the- boat?"  "Come, and we til l'ee," she replied. "You must not sup. pose I depended on that boat for my Smovementsa!"; I: followed ' her to the north side of the island, where was a little cove, in  which I saw a skiff. narrow and long, snugly moored. It had a staff stuck up in the bows, and was furnished with two seats and- two oars, and a broad-bladed paddle. ' This is my boat Master Percy," she said, unlocking a padlock which secured a chain by which it was held fast.; "It is not so fine as the one we sunk," here her brow darkened, as if the ideas connected with that boat were disagreeable to her; "'but it is swift of keel, and'safely carries me where I wish to go. Jump in!" I obeyed her, and took my seat upon the forward thwart. She asked me if I could row; I answered her in the negative. "Can you paddle?" she continued. I satisfied her of my ignorance in this particular. "Yes, yes, they have taught you nothing there, but to pick oakum. But you shall be taught, boy! You shall be taught all you ought to know. I have gold, and you have a lead!- Between us, we will yet see you come to be what you were des- tined to be." I was about to ask her what it was I was destined to be, when she tossed me a yellow roll, and bade me fasten it to the top of the staff in the bows. Upon unrolling it, I saw that it was a small flag. When I saw it fly in the wind, I recollected the torn flag on the top of the Pest-House, and I knew what terrible thing it signified.  "Do you always carry this flag, Aunt Meg!"I asked, a little loath to sail under such an ominous colour. "Yes. It keeps curious persons at a distance-It makes me and my boat respected!" she answered proudly. "But there is no plague-no small-pox now on the island," I remarked                     . .     ,    *           .  .     "TrFE ANS*f) AIVENT'RnEs CrF PETCTVAT, NTAYBERRY. 107 "But there may be to-morrow, and who that -ees me and my boat knows certainly that there is not? Whent it come I am ready to nurse, and at all times I, amr Meg of the-Pest-Island" I saw her now take her seat at the stern of the skiff, which was an old rudely-constructed boat, but perfectly water-tight. Wielding the broad paddle, she sent the boat out of the creek and into the open water, with half a dozen strokes of her vigorous arm. Rapidly we left behind the little gree island, green and picturesquely beautiful in its augwst richnessof verdure and foliage, and telling no tale to thepassing voyager of its terrible secrets of the plague and graves of the dead; save perhaps the scarcely distinguishable shred of the yellow fag that blew out from the staff over the Pest-House. The morning was delight- ful, a gentle wind stirred the ripple of the bay and filled the air with freshness. All about was life and motion. The sea-gll, as white as if carved out of snow, wheeled above our head s in swift and graceful circles; and the silver-green mackerel and glittering-bellied shad would leap from the water, ;lalce an instant in the sunshine, and then fall with a shA/p ai sh ack into their native element. Fishermen were visible reposing in their small barks upon the bay, and patiently toiling for their day's supply; in the entrance to the bay weVre two latge iliips, one coming in, and the other going out. The sialiest of the two had ports, and Meg told me it was a -sloop-ofwar. "What is a sloop of war?"I asked. - "A ship that carries large guns, and is filled with men, and goes out on the ocean to fight the etemies of the country! They are brave and gallant men, these war-men of the sea!" "Of all things, when I get to be a man, I should like to be one, too," I answered with animation. "I always loved ships, and to watch 'em, Aunt Meg, from my Window! I hope yo'll let me be a sailor?" "Let you? The dear boy already asks me!" she soliloqtied . and looking very much pleased. Yes, my boy, you shall be a sailor, when you have been to school It would be- a strange            i           , I     108  LIFE AND ADVEN'TURES OF PFRCIVAL MAYBER BY. thing if you didn't take to the sea, like your grandfather and father before ye!" "And were they sailors? Did you know them?"I interro- gated eagerly. "Oh, Aunt Meg, dear, good Meg, you seem to know so much about me, and about my mother and father, do tell me who   "  "St, st! don't ask questions, Percy I Be content that you have found a friend in me!" "I am--  will be, Aunt Meg; for if I had not fallen in with you," I said gratefully, "I should have perished very soon on the island."  "That you would. Heaven sent you there-for it takes care of the orphan, one way or another; and no other way would have done for you, but to send you to me, as you was I Hah, hah, ho, ho!" she abruptly shouted out to some one ahead. I turned my face forward to look, and saw a small coaster which had been steering near us, putting about, and scudding off. "Ho i ho I my little boat puts to flight your large craft I Don't be alarmed, brothers. Old Meg isn't so bad as she's painted. You may yet get to know me nearer, for what you know"I  "God forbid," ejaculated the skipper; " a wide berth and the lee gage I always want to give you, old one!" Meg laughed, and shook her paddle in the air with a mad flourish, and drove the boat forward faster than before. We next came near two fishermen, who were catching mackerel, and riding at anchor. With mischief in her eyes, for her spirit and love of her peculiar power over the minds and fears of men, were fairly roused, she paddled straight for them, to pass between them. Loudly they halloed to her to keep back, to go to leeward of them; but without paying any attention to their outcries, their alarm only increased her propensity to terrify them. Finding she would advance, the fishermen ran down into the cuddies of their boats and hid, so as not to breathe the tainted air of her path, while we passed swiftly between them. When we got by   "FE AND ADVENITURES OR PERCIVAL MAY1WERliY. 109 they sent after us volleys of oaths, and honoured me with the complimentary soubriquet of the "Hag's Imp!" At length, after an hour's paddling, which did not in the least fatigue her, we entered the romantic mouth of the river, and slowly ascended along its pleasant shores. We passed near an armed schooner which lay at anchor a mile below the town, and Meg, in her boldness, would have: gone very near her, to show me the cannon, when she was hailed through a trumpet from the deck to keep off.  "You see, Master; Percy," said she, "how everybody fears me I Ah, this having power is a famous fine thing. So long as people dread me I am happy. Once I loved everybody; but that was years ago, when I was young and innocent; for I was once young and innocent as you are, child! But we are most up to the town. Look ahead, and you'll see it as we go round this point!" Slowly the roofs and wharves, the shipping and spires of the port opened upon us, and I was enraptured with the life and beauty of the scene. "You said you was in the-town only an hour, and at midnight, Master Percy!" she said, thoughtfully, as if refreshing her memory. "Yes IV T answered. "You saw nobody and nobody saw you?" "Nobody at all," was my reply. "And you were never out of the work-house from the time you were put in there?" she inquired. "No."  "Very well. You will now recollect that you are called " "Percy Berry,' I responded promptly. "Very good. And I am   -" "Aunt Meg!" "Good again. Now if' you are. asked about your past life, you must answer you have always lived in the country-by which     "O  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. . I mean the work-house-but you must never speak of that-for  I intend to make a young gentleman of you, and put you to a school where a President's son might go"I "  "Make a gentleman of me," I cried-" then-then I can-"  Here I stopped full andblushed, and withheld the residue of my  speech, which would have contained the name of the pretty 4 Anne, of whom I had not breathed a word to Aunt Meg. But  the thought of being a "young gentleman," filled me with wild hopes, that I scarcely dared breathe to myself. "Not make one, Master Percy, for you are that already, but educate you like one, as becomes you. But we are near our stopping-place. See! Look at that painted pleasure-boat I How alarmed they look at coming so near us, and are now doing their best to get out of the way! One would think I was the devil in person. But what is the matter, boy?" She might well ask what was the matter. I had discovered on the deck of the gay barge, amid a group of ladies, the angel  of my dreams, the beautiful Anne, and I had no sooner perceived her than I sprung to my feet and clapped my hands, and was ini the act of shouting out her name, when the voice of Meg recalled me to my senses, and enabled me at once to understand that I was making a little fool of myself, as well as endangering what- ever good opinion Anne might have of me by letting her see me in such company as I then was. So, covering my face with my hands to prevent her from recognising me, I dropped down in the bottom of the boat as if I had been shot. After we had passed the pleasure-boat, I rose, and explained my conduct by saying, I thought I saw somebody there who had seen me at the work-house, and so I hid my face. Meg commended me for my discretion, and then amused herself at the ladies on board, who were industriously smelling cologne, and expressing by their looks the detestation of their vicinage to a Pest-boat. "Ah, I make them fear me, rich and poor, gentle and siimn ple,' she said triumphantly. I followed with my eye the receding boat, as it bore away the   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYEERRY.   1I vanishing figure of the charming little girl who Was insensibly exerting such an influence over my very being-whom I was umn consciously making the guide of my destiny-the polar star of my fortune. For her, young as I was, unknown to me as she was, I felt I could cheerfully have given my life! For her I had resolutely determined to be truthful, honest, brave, and respected! If I saw honours in the vista of the future, I pressed forward to pluck them, to enwreath her brow with my laurels, and pour at her feet mny treasures. When her form could no longer be distinguished, the tears trickled through mny fingers, and I felt my little heart very heavy, heavy with poverty and ignorance, heavy with the con- sciousness of her unattainable elevation above me! "What ails thee, Master Percy?" said Meg, looking at me kindly, but with some surprise.  "Nothing! I am a poor wretch-nobody will ever care for me-a poor, work-house boy like me! When I think how rich, and'high, and great, the people of the world be, I know I shall never be equal to 'em, but be looked down upon by those I would love and honour!". I said this with bitterness. "Bless me, how the boy talks! But, take heart! you are as good and great as the best, Master Percy! You were not born in a work-house, nor for one!"It was the foul and wicked wrong of others, for which. God will have them in judgment, you were placed there, as you will one day know, when you are old enough to understand. Keep heart! you are a true lady's son, and no truer man than your father ever trod the deck of a frigate! Let that suffice you.! I tell you this much, that you may hold up your head at your school, and be in feelings what you are by birth. But this is a secret! you must not betray, till the time comes, that you know this of your origin!" ' I promise it, good aunt," I answered, overjoyed at what she had revealed to me. "This is where we land," said she, directing the shallop into a narrow dock, that was full a third of a mile below the town, 9*     "2  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.  and the regular series of docks. It was an old wharf, with a huge elm hanging over the upper end of it, and overshadowing ? an ancient looking dwelling, that had the aspect of a sleamen's  Inn; for, upon a beam swung a sign, on which was incribed in rude characters, underneath a painted ship,  "SAILOR'S SNUGI HARBOUR."  This lonely dock contained but one nearly worn out mackerel  schooner, which was undergoing repairs, and two small boats, like vessels' yawls. There were stairs, slippery and steep, that  led from the water to one of the low doors of the inn. Meg  directed her skiff to the foot of the stairs, and was about to land V there, when out ran two or three seamen, with drinking cups in  their hands, and looks of angry surprise. "Ho! boat ahoy'! yellow flag there, avast and heave to!" they shouted. "Don't come along side of our craft, or we'll sink you!" and they picked up sticks and stones, and menaced  us with them.'- "Don't let us land there, aunt!"I said in some alarm, the seamen looked so determined and fierce. "Fools to be scared at a shadow," yelled Aunt Meg. "There is no small-pox in this boat! Land I will!" My good aunt would have made good her intention, malgr6 the showers of stones and sticks that began to descend about us and into the boat, if a stout fat man had not rushed out and put a stop to the firing, and at the same time beckoned to Aunt Meg  to stop. She suspended her paddling, and said, "There is nothing to fear, Master Keef."' "It may be, but ye had best land below there a bit. You know, Mistress Meg, how we all fear the bit yellow flag that flies at your fore!"'. 'Well, I'll do' it for you, Master John," answered my aunt, something pacified, "but not for these cowards, who would run from the English flag on the salt sea as quick as they do from mine!"  i ,   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 1i3 With these words she drove the boat into an open landing, where a few stones formed a sort of pier, and there we got out, she first securing the boat, and taking the paddle and two oars on her shoulder, but leaving the yellow bunting triumphantly flying. She took her'way with huge strides into the inn, dis- daining to use her crutch, for which she substituted one of the oars, giving me the former to carry. I followed her closely, resolved, that if any one gave battle to her, I would defend her to the best of my ability. "This way-this way, mistress," said the fat man, meeting her at the platform, and bowing with a sort of respect; "come into this room, for you will find the decks all clear there, marm!" Aunt Meg, after looking about at the half-dozen seamen who stood on the gallery looking at her, but at a safe distance, and casting upon each of them individually a glance of scorn and contempt, entered the inn, and throwing aside her bonnet, which had been all the passage hanging by the strings down her back, she took a chair, and motioned for me to take another. "How are you, mistress? How is all over to the place?" inquired the host, indicating the " place" by a jerk of his chin in the direction of 'the island. "All well, John. We ha'n't had any cases there in six months. Since this nocculating business has got into use so, the old Pest House has few inmates. Dull times, dull times, Master John!" "But the city keeps up your reg'lar salary, I hope?" he sug- gested. They do that," she responded emphatically; " for they don't know when they may want me, and if I am gone at, need's time, I shall be hard' to find, like the devil's horse when he wanted to ride a race with St. Peter. To-morrow a French ship might bring me a ship-load of patients. It is best always to prepare for war in peace." l     '   '       i\  '    ,t, \     "4  LIFE AND 4DVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.  "You are right, mistress. I am glad to find you are all so  well!"                           A "All is me and my dog!" she answered, with a laugh.  "And who ishis    gl is this younglad inquired the landlord, resting an inquiring look upon me.           X , "My neffy-a boy I intend to eddicate, and make something  of. I come here to talk with you about the matter, Master Keef."  The man went to the door and closed it, and then placed a before bher a mug of ale and a cracker, as if he knew by expe- rifnee what ahe would have in the way of refreshment.  "Another mug and cracker for the boy!" she said authorita- tively. She was obeyed, and, having set me the example, I was soon making a hearty lunch. As she ate and sipped, and sipped and ate, she talked: "Master Keef, you kniow what is going on in the world, as well as most people," she said, didactically. The little fat man bowed and smiled, saying, "You do me great honour, Mistress Meg. I' am a publican, and see a good many people, and hear a great deal of news!" Cean you tell me where I ean, find a good school for this young gentleman!" "Oh, yes, very readily. There is the town public school, *h6i, for a trifle, you can give him a prime education." i I[ don't want any of your eonmmon schools, man P" she cried, interrupting him so abruptly, that' he fairly winced. "I want a schooi of the firt order 1" "Yes, oh, yes, mem," responded the landlord, eyeing me in my Coarse jacket and trowsera, minus shirt, hat, shoes and stockings, with hair of six months' uneombed luxuriance, so that my head looked like a Spanish shock-dog's. "There is the celebrated Mount Parnassus Aeademy for young gentlemen of the first class! perhaps," and here he eyed me with a side-way leer, that made me angry, for I detected a sarcastic smile under   MFBE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. " his pink eye-lids; " perhaps, that would exactly suit this young gentleman." "You are right," thundered my Aunt Meg, for she had seen and understood his expression. "It is, the very school. I want for him!"          .  Yes, but it is-is--very--" "Very what?" repeated Aunt Meg, with importance. "Very expensive! ' Four hundred dollars a year, half in ad- svance! Here is their advertisement, Mistress Meg, in the weekly paper!" and he handed the Journal to my aunt, who read it over from beginning to end with deep attention, and evidently to her entire satisfaction. "That is the school!" she declared emphatically, as she laid  down the newspaper. "Now, Master Keef, you will be so kind as to direct me the nearest way to it." "It is on the west of the city. You take the street past the college, and half a mile beyond it you will come to a lofty gate- way, that opens upon an avenue. That avenue will lead you to the Academy . Be careful you don't turn to the left before reach- ^ ing the gate, or you will be taken past it to the Work-House!" Both my aunt and I looked in his face at the same moment with the same suspicion; but I could see no signs of any inten- tion beyond the mere accident of his words. My aunt, however, continued to watch his countenance, till she seemed to be fully convinced that he meant nothing and knew nothing about me. She then pulled out her purse, and, making a large display of gold, paid her bill; but the host, instead of taking the coin from her hand, pointed to a box, into which she cast it with a smile of derision, saying, "You need not fumigate my money, Master Keef; it is as pure as any that comes into your till. See that your noisy sai- lors don't do my boat a mischief, while I am gone!" "Be sure they will keep clear of it, and give it a wide berth, mistress. 'But, as a favour, will you pull the yellow bit of fag     "16 LIFE AND ADVENTUPES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. down, till you come back? It will keep off customers from the '! vessels!"  "I strike my flag for no man!" determinedly answered my aunt, bringing her fist down on the table. "I have brought you  more custom than my boat lying here a few hours will lose you.   Besides, does not the law bind me, my master, to keep my flag  flying, whenever I go into my boat! I can't break the laws! So,  good-day, Master John. When I come back I shall, perhaps, have some conference with thee, touching business of moment V" With these words we left the inn, in which we had not re-  mained more than twenty minutes, the host bowing my aunt out, with the air of a man who feared her, and .yetwould conciliate her good-will. We left the tavern to the right, and took a dusty road that led along the river-side. It was lined most of the way by tenements of the most wretched description, in which poverty and crime seemed to dwell, in independent socialism. As we approached the denser portion of the town, the houses were chiefly occupied as sailors' boarding-houses, dance-halls, drinking-shops, aand naval and military rendezvous; for it was the second year of the war with Great Britain, and soldiers and sailors were in great demand. We did not thread the side-walks, crowded as they were with tipsy tars and slatternly women, negroes and for- eigners, some seated, some dancing, some fighting, without re- ceiving a fair share of insulting notice and impertinent abuse. The singular appearance of Aunt Meg, who held me fast by the hand, lest I should stray or be stolen, as she strode along, look- ing neither to the right nor the left, drew many eyes. Some mocked, some whispered among themselves, and gazed after us with awe, mingled with detestation; and not a few cursed us, calling her a Witch, and me her Devil's Brat! Never heed them, Percy!" she said, aside, to me. ' Some day, when they groan with the plague, they will bless the face of old Meg of the Pest-House.. They curse me now, when they have no need of me; but I will have the burying of them yet; for the sun set yellow in an apple-green sky last evening, and   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PfErCIVAL MAYBERRY. 117 this 'is ever the sign of the coming of the plague! Mark my words!" We at length got into a more reputable street, and Meg led me, still grasping my wrist firmly, straight to a shop where ready- made clothing was sold. She entered at the same long, crutch- and-go-one pace which she had kept up ever since we had quitted the inn, and brought herself up so 'short at the counter that the keeper started back and looked amazed. "Boys' clothes!" repeated Meg sternly, and pointed at me. The man looked at me with a tailor's measuring eye, and took from a shelf some coarse jackets.  "Put them back'! I want better things than these!" she cried, impatiently . . The shopkeeper went to a drawer and drew out of it a lad's suit, beautifully embroidered, of blue cassimere. My aunt held it up, turned it round and round on her huge hand, and looked ,satisfied. It was tried on me, and fitted me to a charm. "Put me up three suits in this style, but of colours differ- ent ;" said my aunt, haughtily. '"What is the price?" "Nine dollars each," said the man, and sneering, as if he expected that they would not be purchased., "There is the money in gold," said my magnificent aunt, whom I looked up at with admiration and growing affection; and she placed thirty dollars in sovereigns on the counter. "With the three dollars over, sell me a cap." I was soon handsomely fitted with a blue velvet one, orna- mented with a gold tassel. Shoes and stockings by the half- dozen pairs, and even gloves, were supplied to my aunt's demand here, so that in half an hour, I was in possession of a superb and serviceable outfit. A trunk was sent for, and all these clothes packed into it by my aunt's hands, save one suit complete, which I was invested with, my old work-house suit being rolled and tied up, and stowed into one corner of my trunk, for want of some better mode of disposing of it. From this shop, in which I had undergone such an extraordi-     "8 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OP PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.  nary transformation, my aunt marched with me into a barber'  adjoining, where she electrified the disciples of the tonsorial art by her prompt and masculine orders touching the fashionable cutting and arrangement of my wild locks. These were finally  adjusted to her entire satisfaction, though only her terrible eye kept the master and apprentices from laughing out half a score  of times at her strange conduct during the process. At length  I was wholly transformed, and when she made me 'look at my- self in a full length mirror before quitting the shop, I had no recollection whatsoever of having before seen the richly dressed and extremely good-looking young gentleman who returned my curious gaze. My aunt, was in ecstasies. She turned me round and round, and made me pass and repass before her, to the great amusement of the shop-boys, for whom, however, my aunt cared not a fig. "Come, now, Percy," she said, taking me by the hand, and going out with me, "let us go on our way to the Academy, where I've ordered the man to have your trunk carried ;" and off we started, a strangely assorted pair, and attracting many a curious and inviting eye. 4,   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. H19 CHAPTER VI.- TnHE sudden transformation I had gone through, seemed to me, as I trotted along the street, dragged by Aunt Meg, like one of those unnatural ones, that I bad experienced sometimes in my dreams. It seemed to me, that I was all at once turned into a little Prince, and that Aunt Meg was one of a genii, whose wand and will had effected the extraordinary change. I looked down at my rich apparel, my laced cuffs, my glossy shoes, my velvet vest, and caught sight of the golden tassel of my splendid cap that dangled before my eyes. We-must have presented a strange spectacle to the passers- by, from the manner in which they exhibited their curiosity. Some would stop and look after us, and these I thought, were filled with admiration at the magnificence of my appearance, for I had not the remotest idea, in my innocence and ignorance, of the ludicrous contrast which we exhibited, as we threaded the crowded streets together: the idea of Aunt Meg being ridiculous, or, of being ashamed of one who had done such liberal and great things for me, did not darken the clear, sunny horizon of my present happiness. In my eyes she was the most important person in the world, and by all odds the richest, as well as the most powerful; for I had seen her gold, I had witnessed the fear she produced, and I was the subject of her generosity. Who could be more thought of by me, than one, who thus filled the whole sky of my juvenile observation. Some of those who met us, no sooner saw who she was, than they jumped out of the way and cried out "The Pest Woman!" Boys shouted after us, and threw, stones, one of which hit her, and so enraged me at their want of respect for my protector and friend, that I wanted to go back and chastise the leader of the 10     120 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. mob; but Aunt Meg, who paid no heed to anything or anybody,  said quietly, "Never mind the villains, Percy 1 They only envy you your fine clothes!" Thus saying, she pulled me along. One old gentleman called out to her, Meg, what do you do with that fine lad? Have you found  him?"                  *  "No, doctor," she answered, "lads like this, are not to be  had for the finding. Keep thy curiosity to thyself, and let quiet  folk alone!" The doctor laughed and walked on; and I settled in my own mind that he was a very impertinent old gentleman, thus meddling with my aunt's and my affairs; for my honour and interests had got to be completely identified with hers. We had got to the end of the chief street, the side-walk of which, as we traversed it, we had nearly swept of the people who turned aside or stepped into shop and store-doors as we went by, when a stout red-faced man met us. He no sooner laid his round popped eyes on my tall, striding companion, than he raised a stout cudgel, which he carried with him, slung at his wrist by a leathern thong, and ordered her to walk in the middle of the street, and not pollute the side-walk with the plague! "I will walk where I list, Master Constable," she said, haugh- tily, her eyes flashing fire; and she raised her crutch, which she used as a staff as she walked, one of her legs, as I believe I have before said, being a little shorter than the other. "I have no: more the plague than ye have Let me tear open your breast and look at your heart, man, and we'll then see which is the blackest with plague spots, ye or me! Out of the way, and let me pass on mine errand!" "Where did you come by that boy?" the officer demanded, standing one side to let her pass, and fixing a keen glance upon my face from which I shrunk, for I feared that he would recog- nise in me the runaway work-house boy; and, as a constable, I knew it would have been his duty to arrest me. I therefore              *   .   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 121 ,urned pale, and prepared to bolt if he offered to lay his hand apon me. * "It's a boy whose father's shoes ye might have blacked and felt honoured by it," she answered, with scornful anger; for my aunt could express the sarcastic passions with more vigour than any person I had ever before, or have since seen. "You have stolen him! You have got him to carry off to your island, woman, and keep him till ransom is paid. You are evil enough to do these things. I will take him in hand and return him to his friends! Come, my little gentleman, go with me!"  He extended his hand for the purpose of taking me from my protectress, when I broke from her and ran forward up the street at top speed. My aunt, who saw me thus take flight, called after me to stop, but not before she had laid the constable on his back with a heavy blow of her warlike crutch. She soon came up with me, and taking me by the hand, ran forward with me at a speed that I had no idea she was capable of. I looked back as we ran, and saw the discomfited enemy get to his feet and sh- ke his club after us, and heard him shout, "Stop thief! Stop thief " at the top of his lungs. "Run, Percy! Run on ahead, and get within the gate you see up the road, and leave me to deal with any of these wretches that dare to follow me! The gate is that that leads to Parnassus school. - Wait there till I come up!" "No,' aunt, I'll stay and fight for you," I answered. "Will you, dear? Oh, no! I would not have you hurt for the world.' You are a brave boy, and I love you with my heart of hearts. But curses light on these people! Let them come, and I will make them scatter like scared sheep!" "But if I tell them you didn't steal me, but that I came with you of my own will, they won't harm you nor take me away," I answered. "I ran because I thought the constable knew me and was going to take me back to the work-house!" "He take you back there!' repeated my aunt, indignantly.     122  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.  4 Na he, nor ten score like him Let him lay a finger on my boy, one finger, that's all! But it won't do for you to stay here, because they will ask you who you are; and this it won't do for you to tell; for all you could say about your being my nephew, they wouldn't believe you in your handsome clothes and curly hair; and they would say I had bewitched you to make you say so and to go with me, and they would do their best to get you  away from me! Run on, then, till you come to that seminary gate, and get inside and wait for me!" I made no further objection, and left her just as I saw down the road a party of full forty people coming on, headed by the constable, who had a red handkerchief tied over his brows. They were hooting, and hallooing, and calling on my aunt by all sorts of evil epithets. She remained standing perfectly quiet in the middle of the road, for we had already got out of the streets, and several rods on the road leading into the country. It was a fine sight to behold, that extraordinary woman reposing like a statue, supported by her crutch, in a fearless attitude of expectation, her eyes bent sternly upon the advancing foe. I was so struck with the sublimity of her courage, that I stopped, after I had run a few yards, and gazed back to observe her. She seemed to me like some wrecked and wandering goddess, who laughed at the attempts of men to do her an injury, as if, in the lowness of her fall, she still retained vestiges of her immortal nature. Tall, gray-headed, with her robes flowing in the wind, and leaning upon her crutch as upon a sceptre, she commanded respect. I wondered in my little heart that so mighty a per- sonage could condescend to take a little boy by the hand, and lead him as she had done me! But my admiration was inter- rupted by loud cries. "Drown her! Duck her! She is a gipsy! She is a witch! She has stolen the young gentleman from his friends! She has bewitched him! Let us stone her to death!" were some, of the mingled cries which they poured from their mouths as they advanced upon her. At length the constable came within ten   "FE AND ADVENTURES OP. PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 125 yards, closely followed by the whole of his sustainers. Seeing that she did not move, nor betray the least sign of fear, he thought it discreet to stop far enough off, to secure a safe retreat, in cat victory should incline to desert his colours. He now turned and made a speech to his followers, every period ending with laying his fore-finger emphatically upon his forehead, out of which  blood was oozing. "There she stands! You see her, friends! Never was a wickeder woman on the earth I You all know her I It is Meg of the Pest Island, a woman what has buried more dead people of the plague than every sexton in this city of anything else!" Here there was a cry of horror, and the crowd falling back full twenty yards, left the constable standing alone in the midst. Hereupon he raised his voice. You needn't be afeard of her I There's no plague about now, and she can't hurt nobody, not your hinnocent babby, marm" (this was addressed to a mater- nal looking person who held such an article at her naked bosom), "if you -should place it in her arms!"Hereupon the maternal looking female quickly covered her ' hinnocent babby" with a small shawl, and retreated quite to the skirts of the crowd. "Bles me I What cowards ye all are! I say the witch is 'armless has a kitten! Now, you see she broke my 'ead with her crutch, coz I axed her what she was a doin' with that young gentleman in the gold tassel." Here a butcher-looking man in the crowd ventured to remark with a laugh, that if she had knocked him down, she could not, in his opinion, be regarded as altogether so harmless as he had represented. "I mean about the plague-A the imall- pox, and plague, is what I mean I I'd jist as quick go up and take hold'on her and arrest her as not, so far as the fear o' catchin' it," he added, stoutly.         , "Do it, Hox! do it, master constable 1" cried several jeering voices. "'We'd like to see you do it, Hox Hobbs 1" "Far as the plage is concerned, I sa 1 As for her flg that is a different thing! She'll whip any man in this ro -10*     124  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. and I don't care to 'rest her alone. You see there's no doubt she's stole that boy, and I'll have her up, and make her give an account of him, and then I'll make a complain' agen her, for 'sault and battering. Come, friends, let's rush at her!" The doughty constable flourished his thonged club Above his head, filled his face with valour, and tried to lead a charge of the mixed posse in his rear. But not a man or woman stirred, save to set their feet for a hurried flight, in case of a counter- charge. The constable advanced two steps, and finding he was the only -man in column, he abused the multitude for arrant cowards, and with his stick raised, made a desperate rush upon Aunt Meg, like a man who feels that the world's eye is upon him, and that his official station was expected to distinguish itself in a marked manner-as if the honour, not only of himself, Hox Hobbs, but of the whole constabulary of the town, of the town itself-of the county-nay, of the country at large, was involved  in the issue. It must not be denied that his appearance, as he trotted forward, his fat sides shaking, like John Falstaff's when he fled from the battle-field, was most formidable. His head was bound up with a red handkerchief, which fluttered like pennons behind him; his cheeks were red with blood; his white eyes popped like peeled onions out of his head, and, though short the distance, he panted like a broken-winded horse. He advanced at that discreetful hesitation of the advancing leg, which awaits a hope for the, flight of the opposing party. At each step he paused, as if wondering she did not turn, and give him the opportunity of 'pursuing her in all the glory of victory. But each step only confirmed him in the appalling conviction that she remained firmer and firmer, and that an engagement was inevitable, unless he turned and made his escape. But honour forbade a resort to this mode of personal security. The eyes of all the neighbourhood were upon him, and it was plainly evident to him, that a crisis had arrived in his constabulary career, that must be met, or Hox Hobbs' would be the target, henceforth, for the boys' jeers and Die women's sneers. Hox was a vain man, and loved a pretty   "FE AND ADVENTURES OP PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 125 woman's eye, and was a terror to little boys; and losing these privileges, he would lose all that rendered life sweet to him. But Mr. Hobbs possessed that part of valour which is known as discretion. He now availed himself of a suggestion made by this part of valour, and, coming to a full stop, within seven feet and a half of Aunt Meg, whose very repose and immoveable silence was startling, he thus addressed her': "  a Woman, or fiend, Witch of Endor! Do you know I am a constable of the town? That you have dared to strike a constable?" I could not see the expression of my aunt's face, as her back was turned towards me, but I can fancy what it was, from the reflection of surprise upon his own, and his words: "Well, you may despise the office of the constable, but I tell you it is a fearful thing to lay hands on a town-officer. I have come to arrest you for 'sault and battery! Now, you'd better. give up your crutch quietly to me, and go 'long to the police court. I don't want to use vi'lence. I'm a peaceable man, and respects the feelings of a female woman, if she does wear a beard!" Here the people all laughed, but my aunt said nothing, but must have looked terrible things, for the discreet constable added three feet more to the seven and a half feet which had before divided them. "Come, old Meg, surrender quietly," he added in a coaxing way. "Surrender to such a mass of flesh as you are, Hox Hobbs! Not I! You are a coward, and I will prove it by daring you to ar- rest me! I am an officer of the town, too! I am paid a salary by the town, as well as you! I am doctor and nurse, if you are constable and fool! Come, sirrah, go back and tend the babies in your ward, while you ogle the mothers; go back and terrify and beat little boys, while you kiss the very ground the Mayor has stood upon!" Here my aunt was interrupted by a laugh, "Iouder by far, and more hearty, than; that which had a little while     126  LIFE AND ADVEiNTRES OF PFRCWAL MAYBERRY.' before greeted a portion of the constable's speech. The laugh roused the official's pride and ire, and he made a professional spring towards her, and expected to have grappled 'her shoulder; but she adroitly stepped aside, and catching him in her long, brawny arms, as she would a great fat boy, she threw him across her knee, and administered to him a school-boy slapping, after a method that would have delighted the most eminent school mis- tress who advocated the discipline of the paddle. The mob roared, laughed, hurrahed, and yelled, with delight. Hobbs kicked and swore and struggled, but did' not get away, until she had replaced him upon his feet, and given him a smacking- kiss, saying,  "Go, little boy, and take that, as you love to kiss the dames so much 1" She then shouldered her crutch, and strode up the road after me, rejoining. me with a countenance in which there could be read only an expression .of perfect indifference, and wholly unmoved. "Come, Percy, I think we shall not be troubled now!" she said, catching my hand and moving on without turning her head. As I looked back, I saw the constable standing in the midst of the highway, the centre of the ironical sympathies of his neighbours; while boys, suddenly become heroes, climbing the / fruit trees on the road-side, pelted him with green apples and hard peaches, so that at last he became furious, roared like a bull, and charged in earnest upon the multitude, who\fled laugh- ing, and leaving him possession of the field of his disgrace. "Well done, old Meg! Brave old Meg!" shouted the boys after my aunt, till we got out of hearing. The last I could see of the discomfited functionary, he was slowly making his way back as he had come, violently gesticu- lating, now shaking his stick at the, more daring boys who ven- tured to pull at his coat, and now stopping to double his fist at us. The road along which we walked was rural, with green mea- dows and pretty cottages on either hand. It was, in fact,-the   "FE AND ADVENTURES OR PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 127 very one which poor Dick and. I had taken in our flight to the town, after quitting the gallows. An dpehiang in the trees sud- denly' exposed to full view the work-house, less than half a'mile distant to the left in -a south-west direction. At the very time that its discovery made mie trbiile, for fear I should be recog- nised by some one coming from it, we came to a slight bend in the road which led off to the right. At this bend was a guide-post, oh which were two signs, one of which read, "'To THE COUNTY POOR-HOUSE, : A MLE;" and the other," To THE PARNASSUS CLASSICAL ACADEMY, } A MLE i"  There was a white arched gateway at this point, which led into a sort of park, over the trees of which I caught glimpses of a brown tower and a terrace. "This is the way," said my aunt, trying to open the gate; but as it was'a "patent catch," it defied her skill and even her strength, for she did her best with a stone to break it. "We shall have to climb the gate, Percy," she said. I would here remark, that she always spoke my name when she addressed me, in a tone of kindness that invested it with a new charm to my ear;; for the sound of it from Shirkey's lips made me detest it; but I loved always to hear my aunt say ' Percy," in her gentle, kind manner--gentle and kind, ho matter how'bitterly she may have been speaking to others the instant previous. I was soon over the gate, but it was a formidable and ludi- crous affair for Aunt Meg to perform the same feat. But she straddled over boldly in her petticoats, and by the aid of her crutch struck the ground seven feet beyond. The enclosure in which we now found ourselves was a very fine place to my eyes, accustomed only to the bleak, loam-washed commons which surrounded the work-house. The latter was approached by crossing bleak fields which had been worn out by cultivation, and had, no doubt, been located where it was through the economy of the commissioners, who had probably purchased the land for a trifle The fact that the gallows was in the same bleak barrens did not offer any &stacle in'the decisions of the     AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.               LI gentlemen who were intrusted with the purchase. Doubtless they placed implicit faith in the proverb, that " poverty and crime go together."  One road from the town led to the work-house and to the Classical Academy, but divided right and left when within half a mile of each. I had from the work-house seen the roof and cupola of Parnassus Academy, and greatly admired its. imposing beauty; and I had gained some imperfect knowledge that it was a place where the sons of rich and great people were educated; but I regarded it like the sun, or the moon, or the stars; as something afar off, and which I had no more relation to than I had with these. We had no sooner achieved the escalade of the tall white gate than the noise of the wheels of a carriage arrested our ears, and the next moment a superb chariot drove to the gate and reined up. Upon the box was a white coachman in a blue coat orna- mented with large silver-white buttons and a silver-laced hat, with buff knee-breeches and buff top-boots. Behind the carriage stood a footman, though I then took him to be a remarkably fine gentleman, he was so handsomely dressed. He sprung to the ground, and advanced to open the gate. As he was trying the latch with as little success as my aunt had met with, I had an oppor- tunity of observing who were in the carriage. There were two persons, a handsome lady, and a boy about my own age, or; per- haps, half a year my senior. He had a fine, open brow, and a noble, frank expression, that won my regards in a moment. Though he did not look at all like Anne, the sight of him made me think of her; for he belonged to the same elevated position, and naturally carried on his face that stamp of birth and refine- ment that had made her appear to me'so different from any person I had ever seen before her.' My aunt regarded the face of the lady with close scrutiny, and the expression that lighted up her eye showed me that the result was in the highest degree gratifying to her. She caught me abruptly by the wrist, and whispered impressively,   LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 129   "That boy and you must be friends. You must make him your friend, Percy !" "I should be glad to, aunt," I replied, "for I like him so much already ' "That is good-that is as it should be," she answered, rather to herself than to me. The secret of the gate was at length mastered, and the foot- man, holding it wide open, waited for the carriage to drive through, which it did at a trot.' The man, then, in his anxiety to regain his seat, let the gate fly to, and with such a loud ring, that the horses both started forward frightened. The coachman,. in his efforts to rein them in, parted one of the reins. near 'the bit. The reaction of his arm threw him backward, and would have sent him headlong from his box, if he had not caught by the silver railing on the side. As it was, he lost his presence of mind, dropped the other reins, and left the horses to their own wills. It is probable that they would have been at once checked but for the breaking of the rein; but being now free from con- trol, they plunged madly forward. We were some yards up the avenue when the carriage passed by us at wild speed. The lady was calling to the terrified coachman to recover his reins, which were dragging on the earth, and the boy was clasping his hands, in momentary expectation that the coach would be dashed to pieces against some one of the trees that grew close to the avenue along which the horses were tearing. My first impulse was to try to catch one of- the horses by the bit, which would have resulted in my certain destruction, but m aunt thrust me back, ana with one tremendous leap forward, caught up the flying reins, and then began to run along side of the horses, speaking to them, and drawing them in steadily and strongly. Carriage, horses, and my aunt soon disappeared in 4 winding of the road, leaying me quito alone, but hastening for. ward, full of anxiety for the result. At length, after running a quarter of a mile, I came in sight of the carriage. It was stand- ing still in the road, the lady and her son out of it, and safe      130  LiFF AND ADVENTURES. OP PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. upon their feet, and the coachman busy mending the broken rein. "You have saved my life, and the life of my son, good woman," I heard the lady say, as I drew near, and she took her hard hand and pressed it warmly, and made her. son give his to my aunt, into whose face he looked up with an expression of mingled awe and gratitude; for to children especially, Aunt Meg was an in- comprehensible person. The lady also regarded her with curi- osity, while she overwhelmed her with her thanks. "I have done no more than myduty, lady," answered my aunt, with a respect in her manner that surprised me; for, I knew how little she had of reverence for any of her species. "Will you take a memorial of my gratitude?" said the lady, handing her a purse. "I save not blood for gold! responded my aunt, putting back the gift. "'How, then, can I show you my appreciation of the service you have done me?"' said the lady, who looked at her as if she was trying to comprehend her. "Is this your son?" said my aunt, laying her hand gently on t1he shoulder of the lad, who, though he came so grandlyin a carriage, I saw was dressed far more plainly than I was. "Yes," she replied, half drawing the boy back from the mas- culine hold of my aunt. "Is he going to school up here?" asked my aunt, pointing, with a jerk of her elbow, in the direction of the Institute, which was now in full sight, not a great way off. "Yes; he has been here a year, and is now returning after vacation," she answered, with politeness. "Come here!" called out my aunt, looking in the direction where I stood; for, having come near them, I stopped, hesita- ting to approach, unless bidden by my aunt. "It is my boy," she added. I at once walked forward. The lady regarded me with sur- eprise and admiration of my appearance, as well she might do, for -      s  ' .*.   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 131 1.1 my apparel was of the most splendid description. She looked then at my aunt, and again inspecting me, said, with confidence, "I see, now! You are play-actors, good woman'!" "What?" repeated Aunt Meg. "Circus-people, I suppose," repeated the lady; but this makes me 'feel no less grateful to you. I think you will take the money, my handsome little fellow!" she added, proffering the purse to me." "The carriage is ready, ma'am," said the coachman. I had seen my aunt decline it, and I imitated her example. "W e are not play-people, ma'am, "responded my aunt, firmly, but without any emotion of displeasure.  "Beg your pardon--but"-and here she glanced at me, as if my appearance was sufficient to justify her expressed opinion. "No harm, marm--none at all! You say you wish to do me I service. You can do so. Your boy is a scholar up there! I am just going to place my boy there! All I ask of you is, that you will encourage your fine son and him to' be friends. My brave boy will be lonely there, and may need friendship." "Edward would like nothing better, I am sure," answered his mother, with looks of pleasure. We will be friends at once, mother, and I shall never forget what his mother has done for us to-day." "Not his mother, but his aunt," said my protectoress, cor- recting him. "That is right, my noble boy," she added, as she saw him advance towards me, and after looking me steadily in the face a moment, frankly stretch out his hand for me to shake. I warmly grasped it, met his eyes with a smile, which was an- swered by him, and from that moment there was firmly sealed a compact of amity. My aunt looked perfectly happy.  She placed her hand upon his heads and blessed him audibly; and then speaking to the lady, she said, "Be also his friend, madam'! He is worthy of your love and protection!' "     132  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. "What is his name? whose child is he?" asked the iaky, regarding me with looks of interest. "The child of one, lady, as high in the world's eye as thyself," answered my aunt, proudly. "Do you know me, then?" "Or would I so confidently ask the friendship of thy son and thyself, for my boy?" she replied with some mystery. "His name, you ask. It is Percy Berry." "How is it that you, who are so different in appearance from this boy, take so deep an interest in him?" she asked. But see- ing that the question was disagreeable to my aunt, she said quickly, "But no matter! I will befriend him; and as for Ed- ward, I see that he and Master Berry are already on excellent terms 1"  She said truly. The youth, who, as I have said, was a fine specimen of a high-bred, manly boy, had taken me by the arm, and was walking me along with him past the carriage, towards the Institute. He was asking me a dozen questions, what my name was, where I had just come from? if I intended to join the Juniors or Second Seniors in the school? and who had been my last master! As to the first question, I answered it without difficulty; the second embarrassed me, but I told him, generally I had just come from the town; the third was wholly inexplica- ble to me; for I had no kind of idea what Senior or Junior meant; but I replied, that I should leave all those things to my aunt. The last inquiry I could easily have answered, by saying, that my last master was Shirkey; but I feared to tell him this fact, as Aunt Meg had strictly forbidden me to allude to the Poor- house. I did not then know that by master he meant " teacher;" and I began to ask him with some trepidation, if they had mas. ters at the school. Before he could reply, his mother called to him to come back, and get into the carriage. "I will walk with Percy, mother," he answered. "No, no! I shall have no time to spare to-wait, for you, my son. Percy will ride with you!"   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL TMAYBERRY.  133 "That is capital, Percy! Jump in!" he cried. I looked at my aunt, who, by a look, bade me obey, saying aloud that she would walk on. The lady glanced towards her embarrassedly two or three times, as if she felt disposed to invite her to occupy the fourth seat in the chariot; but each time she turned away, as if she felt that such an odd-looking personage added to her party would draw down the ridicule of all who beheld them together. Such at least was the expression of her expressive and charming countenance. I had never been in a coach before, and I hardly knew how to mount the steps or seat myself; but I followed the example of Edward, for I had learned this was his name. The delightful rolling motion of the chariot was so novel and pleasing to me, who only forty-eight hours before was but a poor work-house boy, that my pulse beat with strange delight. I could scarcely realize and be sure of my own identity. I looked at my splendid dress, felt the golden tassel dangling against my ear, and at the richly-dressed lady facing me, and her genteel son, and the superb carriage, and noble horses, and I could hardly help asking inyself aloud, if I was the same Percival Mayberry, who, two days before, had been picking oakuni in the work-house picking- room, barefooted, and clad in a suit of homespun too small for me by two years' size. The varied and extraordinary scenes I had passed through within the space of two days' time, had given me a wonderful deal of experience. I had learned almost five years of observation of the world in these few hours. My intel- lect, my judgment,. my reasoning powers, all seemed- to have taken a leap forward. I had self-possession, reflection, adap- tation to my new and eitraordinary circumstances, far beyond my years; far beyond what any one who had known me a month before would have suspected me capable of. But my powers of observation and my intelligence had been awakened from my first sight and speech of the lovely stranger, Anne, four weeks before. During that four weeks I had been transported from childhood, past boyhood, to almost the rcflctive maturity of *       i    ,       134  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. man. I had caution enough to keep my own secret, so carefully enjoined upon me by-Aunt Meg, for I already understood that it would be, in my future prospects, infamous tome to have it known;  not that there can be real infamy attached to recipients of work- house charity, but the world's eye sees the shadow often more distinctly than it does the substance. My aunt's talk With me as I was coming in the boat, for I have not recorded here all the conversation she held with me, had shown me how harshy society judges the poor and then miserable, and that the confession of poverty is little more pardoned than the confession of crime. Thus, with a great secret to keep weighing on my mind, and yet with a manly love of truth in all that I uttered, and a dis- dain of fasehood, I was about to enter upon my 'new career as a pupil.   "I will not lie," I said to myself firmly, "I will not tell who I am, nor will I lie!" "You seem thoughtful, Master Percy," said the lady, look- ing at me and smiling. "You have no doubt some grief at parting with your friends to come to school." "I have no friends but Aunt Meg," I answered bluntly, and seeing no reason why I should not have replied just as I did, till her looks of surprise and curiosity fixed upon me, and those of my new companion also, showed me I had in some way corn-  mitted myself.  ' Have no friends, child! That is very strange. But no- perhaps you are an orphan?" she added, kindly. "I am an orphan," I answered. And that la-that woman-she who so bravely stopped the  horses just as they were coining to the little gothic bridge which would have wrecked us, had we hit it, is she your only friend?" "Yes, and a true friend, ma'am, if a poor boy ever had one!" ' You a poor boy, Berry!" repeated Edward, with a smile of gpod-humour, and looking at my new clothes. '"One would think you were as rich as Croesus." I did not then know who   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 135 Cresus was; but I replied quickly, in order to repair my second blunder, that "my aunt was rich, and would give me what I desired." "She seems to be a queer cove though," remarked the young gentleman, looking at her out of the carriage window as she  strode along, with her crutch and lope gait, almost as fast-as  the horses trotted up the ascent that led to the academy. :"She's odd-not like other people, perhaps," remarked his mother, seeing me colour, but I dare say she is as good-hearted as she is brave!" ' Suddenly my aunt laid her hand on the window of the car- riage, and called in a tone of authority to the coachman to stop the horses. He instantly obeyed, touching his hat respectfully to the woman, to whom he felt he owed his life. "Madam," said my aunt, filling the window with her dark face and gray head," I have concluded not to go to the school with my boq. You see I am not the sort of person to place a youth at this academy. My presence with him might throw ridicule upon him, for I know the world! Now, madam; will you suffer my boy to go on to the academy with you, and will you take this .purse-it contains four hundred dollars in gold- and place it in the hands of the Head Master, and say that at the end of the year he shall be paid the same punctually?" The lady seemed much struck, and even touched with the dignified manner and air of self-respect with which my aunt alluded to the impropriety, of her accompanying me, and looked as if she sympathized with her, and respected her, as a woman of good sense and right feeling, with all her eutr6 appearance. "Yes,' she answered warmly, "I will do anything you ask to serve you; for I feel I can never repay the debt I have in- curred to you. The money shall be disposed of as you re- quest, and I will take. a receipt for it, which I will give to- whom?"  "To me, madam, I will await your return at the gate," an- swered my aunt. She then poured the gold out and counted it t       136 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. it before the lady, to show her that the amount was as she had  stated, and what the Head Master demanded per annum for his pupils. She then placed a small green purse in my hand, 'saying, ' There, Percy---that is your own, to do with as you please. I will come and see you from time to time. Now be studious -obey your teachers-and 'don't forget your Aunt Meg, nor the advice and counsels she has given you. Farewell, my dear boy!" Her voice trembled-she seized my face between her hard hands, kissed me on the mouth as gently as she would have pressed the lips of an infant, and then taking the hand of Edward, she said, impressively,  "Young gentleman, you have promised me that you will be a - friend to this youth. I know you will keep what your lips have uttered, for your father was a man who never ate his own words, ,or refused to defend with his arm what he had spoken with 'his lips!" With these words she vanished from the window, pulled her old bonnet over her face, and strode away, calling first to the driver to go on. I saw the eyes of my companion sparkle with pride at 'the words she had spolen to him of his father, and I knew that, frqm that moment, he was not only my friend, but the friend of my aunt, "queer cove" as he had been disposed to regard her. As for the lady, she looked, after her for some minutes, and then exclaimed, "Who can she be? What an extraordinary person!" she then appeared to be about to question me, but seeing that I was biting my lips to keep from crying, the tears racing down my cheeks like the first drops of an April rain, she 'was silent and thoughtful. "Mother, I shall always like that woman, Percy's queer-lok- ing aunt," said Edward, with ardent feelings. "How did she know my father so well? If I don't try to be like him, may I -            I ( '- .   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 137 never live to be a man! By the Lord Harry, Percy, but you are rich, and will have money to lend to the boys!"You'll be one o' the most popular fellows in school while it lasts!" E did not heed him, I wasi so much grieved at' the departure of my aunt--for aunt, and mother, and all friends in one, she was to me! Two days had been enough for me to see that under a rough exterior she carried a true and kind heart, at least' it was kind towards me, though it seemed, in' truth, to be hostile to all the world beside; and I question if she loved anything until I was so singularly thrown in her way. I felt that she was my truest and best friend, and that she had done for me all that an angel could have done, had one found me and been disposed to make me perfectly happy. Why she had made me the object of her affection I could not divine; but I knew that the cause was related in some incomprehensible manner with some relations she had in former days held with my parents. That she had known them, she as much as confessed to me; for she had filled my heart with joy by revealing to me that they were of an ele- vated position in society; not that anything I then understood of the system of society should have caused this intelligence to gratify me, but. I knew Anne was high-born, and equality of birth on my part might, perhaps, one day place me her equal in her sweet presence! It was this reflection that filled me with joy at the idea that I also was well-born, and might yet one day gain by courage and perseverance the position from which unknown adverse fortunes had cast me down-down so low as to be a parish work-house boy! Was I in love, reader? I do not know! If it was love, it was that pure, heaven-born love, known in Paradise, without passion or selfishness. If I, at eleven, was in love with Anne at ten, it was such love as maturer manhood, with all its power of conquest and of possession, cannot under- stand or approach! There is a love of boyhood and girlhood I It is love's spring, and is distinct from that maturer summer of love, which must end in matrimony to be complete. It is love's     138  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBRRY. young spring, the budding and cooing time df our life-its field lies between the ages of ten and fourteen. After that comes the other and maturer love--the summer of the heart. The spring loves, the awnourettes of boyhood, then are forgotten-its matings and pairings in this love's rehearal 'are remembered no more; and hearts that swore eternal fidelity at twelve, at eighteen throb for other hearts with another kind of love-and that other kind of love is passion i Who has not passed through the sweet,  happy, heart-burning, wild, dreaming spring-time of love! Who would not exchange the maturity of his autumnal fruitages for those halcyon days, when earth was a heaven aad little girls angels?    ;  My attention was now attracted to the Institute itself, by the exclamations of nmy young friend, who, as we drove up to the front, recognised on the terrace and portico several of his class mates, whom he hailed by their names, as if delighted to see them again. 'The building, as I gazed out of the window at it, was large and imposing; built in the fresh modern gothic style, with turrets crowning each wing, and a square tower with a bell in it over the centre. It was situated upon the top of a gentle eminence, and had a terrace and grssee or glacis extending in a half circle along the front, bordered with young trees. In the  centre of this green slope was a flight of broad stone steps, with a statue of carved wood painted white, adorning each side of it, large as life, one representing, as I subsequently learned, His- TORY, the other, SCIENsE, who had a globe at her feet. The gravelled carriage-way terminated at these steps, where our horses drew up. On the steps were crowding several lads, all well dressed, but none of them, I noticed, so richly as Iwas myself. They thronged about the window, before the footman could open the door, and called out with smiling countenances, brimful of welcome and gladness:  "How are ye, Ned I Glad to see you back again, Fields!- You are a week behind the term-time! Better late than never, Ed! .   "TFE AND ADVENTURES OF PE1RCIVAL MAYBEtBR  . 139 and such like speeches, while three or four of the finest lads among them reached up to the window and shook him heartily by the hand as 'he leaned across me. They also bowed -and touched their hats with politeness to his mother, who gave her jewelled hand to several, a hand so soft and white and tapering and small, that it looked like a babes' conipared with Aunt Meg's. A little in the rear"of the 'boys, on the short walk that 'led from the top of the steps to the poirtib of the academy," *te two young men, thoughtful aiid quiet, one e' whom wosre peW- tacles. They stood observing oi&itrrival, but inot appro6ahinig, and being seen by Edward, he asked one of the boys whb they were.  "The two new tutors-one of 'em a' capital fallow-ybou ll like him," was the response. "But there combs old Gigantibus himself!" The personage thus designated proved to be an enormously tall, bony, square-built man, full six feet and 'a half in height in his socks, with broad Scotch features, a huge hand, and shuger foot. He wore a complete suit of snuff-colour, cut in the fashion of that day, that is, something in the quaker-style of the present. His breeches were fastened'at the knee by jet buckles that spar- kled at each 4step, and his squaretoed shoes :were half-covered with similar buckles -of ebony glass sets. His stockings were blue yarn, and fitted closely to a muscular and well-shaped calf. His hair was red, at least such portion of it as had not become gray, and instead of being worn in a queue and tied with a rib- bon, as was the custom of the day, was cut short and stood erect all over his head, somewhat after the fashion of Aunt Meg, to whom I thought he bore a sort of masculine resemblance. His ears were very large and red, and out of each I noticed there grew a long tuft of gray hir. His eyebrows were remarkably long, and curved downward over his eyes like -a thatched roof. His eyes were large, wide open, and of a deep blue, full of good- nature, sense, and intelligence; and about his huge homely     "O  LIFE AND ADVENTUfES OF PERCIVAL MhAYBERRVY. mouth played a kind and ben'volent expression that at once made me take to him, and feel/that I should like him; for in- stinctively I understood that he was the Head Master; for at his approach the boys became silent, and drew back to give him way to the carriage. The footman had by this time opened the door, and I hadtfollowed Edward Fields out, and was introduced by him to his friends as Master Berry, a new boy-and a first- rate fellow," whereupon half a score of boys crowded up and shook me by the hand, and received me so handsomely that I not only began to feel for myself that self-respect which I had  great need of, considering that neither I nor anybody else had ever shown any consideration for me till of late, but I felt moved even to tears at this reception, so different from anything I had ever experienced (before. I observed that my companion whispered something to two or three of the boys, who, after gazing on me with more curiosity than before, for they had not failed from the first to give my I gay apparel all the honour that staring could confer, regarded me with an increased respect, for which I could not account. There was, however, one boy, elegantly formed but slender in n make, with features singularly beautiful, but which seemed the  strange beauty of a fallen seraph, who drew my attention by a sneer that curled his finely chiselled lip, and of which I was too h palpably the object. That one look, surrounded though I was by go many pleasant faces, troubled me and angered me, and I  could not keep my eyes from the face which wore it, and on  which it seemed engraven, it was so fixed. He was apart from , ve the others, leaning in an attitude of graceful indolence against the pedestal of the statue of History. He was dressed in deep  black, and his hair and eyes being jet black; his appearance was so at once striking and marked, and he would have awakened my h curiosity even if I had not chanced to catch the sneer with which he saw fit to notice me.' Near him lounged another boy, larger, mi and heavily if not coarsely made, with vulgar and vicious  as features--a complete contrast to the other in all points, yet they wi ;              .    "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYIBERRY.   4 1 seemed to be friends and to select each other's companionship;' for the former quietly made a remark to him in a half whisper, at which the other, after staring broadly and impudently at me, burst into a rude laugh. The boy in black might have been of my age, and the other three years older, or in his fifteenth year. In my heart was instantly born defiance towards the one and contempt for the other. In my bosom I received them both as, what I felt in my future they must be, enemies! CHAPTER VII. THE head inaster, whom I had heard called Giganticus, ap. preached the carriage with many a profound bow, arid, offering his hand to the lady, assisted her in alighting. "I have kept Edward rather behind time, dotor," she re- marked, as she ascended the steps. Hed replied, in a voice that was as base as a bassoon: "His talents, madam, his talents and vim, madam, will insure his speedy arrival at that page of his text-book, where his class are now studying. Ah, Master Fields, I am.glad to see you back to the shades of Parnassus I" and the huge doctor extended three fingers of his left hand, to my new friend, who. shook them very cordially, and, at the same time, bowed with respect. "Here, too, is a new scholar for you, Doetor Brodhead," said the lady; her voice, compared with his deep, base-drum contralto, sounding like a flute ;. and she beckoned to me, took me by the hand, and presented me to the awful man. I bowed as politely as I knew how, for the refinement of my- manners had not been much attended tqat the work.house, and as he-extended one finger to me, I took hold of it, and shook it with great respect. He then fixed his eyes steadily upon me for    "2  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. a few seconds, as if he was trying to make me out, let his gaze rest awhile on my apparel, and remarked to the lady, aA fine lad, ma'am! Is he your nephew?" "No, sir-not any relation of mine--but the nephew of a friend; that is, of a person who has done me a great service." This was saidin a hesitating way, and with an embarrassment of air and manner, that showed she hardly knew how to reply. "His name is Percy Berry, doctor," she added, walking on with the head master, and mounting the portico ; I following closely, leaving Edward with the other boys, to whom he seemed to be making a sort of harangue. "I am requested by her, sir, to place him with you for a year, and here is the amount in advance, which, I believe, you will find accurate."  The doctor bowed upon her hand which offered the purse my aunt had directed to be given him, and replied, "Any friend of yours, madam, will be most welcome to the Academic groves. I receive Master Berry with pleasure. If he manifests anything of the talents of your son, he will confer honour on this Institution, which, I assure you, madam, is every year becomingmore patronized by the rich and intelligent por- tion of the community. We need only to be tried, ma'am! 'Try us' is the motto of Parnassus Classical Academy!" Here the learned man bowed reverently, as if in respect to the name he had pronounced; and afterwards, I always remarked, that he never mentioned the name of his Academy but with a reveren- tial bend of his body.  "I am requested to say, sir, that the same amount will be paid you on the first day of every year, in behalf of Master Berry." "I am deeply honoured, madam, by the confidence in my school, on the part of your friend- --" "She is not exactly a friend of mine, sir, but I have promised to act for her in this matter, doctor!" "You could not have done better, madam, were she your sis- ter ' Walk in, sir!" This invitation was addressed to me, and   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 143 followed them into a room lined with books, maps, and prints, and containing innumerable unknown objects, which I afterwards understood were the philosophical apparatus of the. school. The apartment was quite as much crowded as my aunt's cabin on the island, but with very different 'kinds of articles, 'yet I had no sooner entered it than I was, oddly enough, reminded of her quarters; and the more I looked at the doctor, 'the more he brought my aunt vividly before me; yet, save in vastness of stature, and a certain positiveness of manner, there could be traced no actual resemblance. But we are. frequently reminded of things by their opposites, and it may have been so, I reflected, in the present case. Sit down, Mrs. Fields, sit down, madam," said the doctor, removing an atlas from an arm-chair, and placing it for her, while he directed me to sit upon a pile of big books. I, however, pre- ferred standing. At the lady's request, the doctor then counted the money. and prepared to give a receipt.' "In whose name, ma'am?" he asked, looking at her over a pair of blue glasses as large andsround as half-dollars. "In your own?" The lady coloured and looked at me, and then came and whis- pered to me and asked my autt's name. "Meg," I said, so naively that she smiled. "But her full name, my boy?" she repeated. "I don't know any other," I answered, unless it is Aunt Meg." At this I saw her bite her beautiful under lip, and heard escape her lips the words, "How strange! What a singular pair! There is some mystery about this; but I will put an end to my part in the matter with this receipt. You may make it out, Doctor Brodhead, in the youth's name-Percy Berry!" The receipt was placed in her hands, and my name and age was asked for by the doctor, to be placed on the Register, a huge buff-covered ledger-like book, which he formally spread open before him. 12     "4  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PFRCIVAL MAYBERRY. "I am nearly eleven, sir. My name is Percy May-I mean my name is Berry, sir-Percy Berry," I answered, with an awkward ,lunder, "And where were you born, Master Berry?"      , Here I coloured and hesitated, and twirled my velvet blue cap by its gold tassel, and looked around the room as if I could be relieved from my dilemma, and expected to find on 'the walls, printed in full, the altogether unknown place inquired for. H felt the full difficulty of my position, and the suspicions that might be awakened from my inability to answer a question that every boy who aspired to become a pupil of such a genteel and exclusive a school as Parnassus Academy, must be supposed to know. I grew nervous, and my perplexity was fast mastering my self-possession, when my eyes fell upon the words "Island of Cubay" in large letters, at the bottom of a map of that Spanish island, The words no sooner passed through my eyes, than they lighted on my tongue, and before I could understand how it was done, or prevent the issue, I heard myself repeating aloud the words. Some mysterious and unfathomable impulse, begotten  by fear, had for the moment the control of my vocal powers, independent of my inclinations. I was startled at the sound of my voice, and was about to say without delay, "No, no-I was not born there," when the doctor, repeating with an air of great respect, "Born in the West Indies," wrote it down in large hand oppo-- site my name. When I saw him writing it I withheld my words of denial, for what else could I substitute; and my aunt had given me the most solemn warning not to betray by any inadver- tence my past life; and a boy born nowhere, would hardly have found favour in the eyes of the aristocratic master and pupils of Parnassus School. So I had the discretion to let my slip of the tongue pass, though I felt my ears tingle as if I had been guilty of a premeditated falsehood, a'thing that was far from my thoughts. "I am honoured, madam," remarked the doctor, looking like a great blue-eyed owl at the lady through 'his glasses, "I am   "FE AND ADVENTURES OR PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 145 oeculiarly flattered when a pupil arrives from a foreign land to ,cek admission into our Classical Academy. It shows we are - nown, ma'anm! It speaks volumes for: the extent of our fame.' I suppose the young gentleman speaks Spanish, and is the son of a sugar or coffee planter. I will record this fact."' ' He is an orphan, I believe," remarked the lady, looking at me inquiringly. I bowed affirmatively, though I had an indistinct notion that to admit this as a fact was virtually confessing that I had been in the poor-house. But I could not tell an untruth. "No doubt very rich! Born in Cuba, eh! This will account for the rich and foreign style of his dress, madam; for I assure you I have been not a little puzzled to account for hit unusual costume. Is it the wish of his aunt that' he should dress in this style?'?  "It is," I answered, not a little indignant that the suit chosen by my aunt should occasion any disparaging remarks; for in my estimation she could do no wrong. At this moment the door opened, and, an Irish servant came in with a new trunk on his shoulder, which I recognised at a glance as my own. "'Ere is a thrunk, yer 'onor, for won o' the new byes," said the man, setting it down on one end. "What' is it marked!" asked the doctor. "Master Percy Berry, Parnassus Academy," respondi the voice of Edward, who had followed the trunk in.  "Yes, it is my trunk," I answered, with something .of a feein of juvenile importance, which, as it was the first one I had ever possessed, my kind readers will no doubt readily pardon in mue. "The kay istied ter it, yer 'onor," said the man. "I will open it and take an inventory of your things, Master Berry," said the doctor, unlocking it. "This is our general rule on receiving a pupil." : At the display of the four costly and richly embroidered suits, and other articles to match, of the finest description, and in     a 146 LIFE AND ADVENTVRESOF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. abundance' unusual, the: lady looked surprised, and I saw her smile as she remarked to the. doctor, taking up a laced shirt, AThey dress their children a great deal in the West Indies. Here in New England, we should hardly venture to put such apparel on, our boys." They are rich, very rich there, and have gold mines, ma'am I If you turn to the Geography we use at our academy, you will learn what wealth there is in those Islands; and we have a His- tory, ma'am, your son will go into it this session, 'that says the Cuban planters live like oriental Nabobs. This young gentle- man seems to have the outfit of a young prince!" I wai not a little gratified at the adniration my aunt's pur- chaes- had mi4e, and gave her all the praise. Edward was filled with surprise, and ran out telling the other boys what 'marvels my trunk contained. The doctor having taken a list of the contents, called a tutor, one of the pale young men I had Been before the door, and said to him, ' Jenks, conduct this young gentleman, Master Berry, to room No. 19 for the present, till we see what class we shall place him in, and then we can room himi with some of his class-mates. You will find the room pleasant, and you will occupy it alone, Master Berry, till we class you," he added, addressing me. "Take up the trunk, Terry., You hav no books?" he asked. "None, si," E re iid; f"but I have money to buy them." "All very prope     we will attend to that to-morrow. See him to hit romj Jenks, and giehim some notion of the localities. Walk about with him, and make him acquainted a little!" Jenks, who was a cadaVerous) high cheek-boned, overgrown young man of twenty-four, with a look of great simplicity, and a gait singularly awkward, beckoned me to follow him. I bowed to the head master, and was going out, when the lady ex- tended her hand and said, Good-bye, Master Berry. I have no doubt you will find a good friend in Edward. He is a little wild and wayward, but   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY, 147 he will think more of you when he knows that you are far from your own country and need companionship." "I think I shall like him, marm. If you see my aunt,"'I added, "tell her I am pleased with the school, thus far." "  I will do so. But is that singular person your aunt, Master Berry?" she asked, in a tone of confidence that I could hardly resist.  "She is the only one I ever called aunt," I answered, eva- 'sively. I then quickly added, "I wish, ma'am, you would tell hex how much I love her-how I thank her for what she has done for me-and that I will never forget her-and that she must come and see me whenever she can." She promised to do so, and the lady giving me her hand to shake, I parted with her, almost leaving my heart with her, she was so beautiful, kind, and good; and I envied Edward that he had such a mother. The kusher led theway from the doctor's study, through a long and lofty passage, which, was lined with boys-I believe every one of the one hundred and forty that belonged to. the school, who were dispersed in groups about the doors and stairs. Some of them stared at me openly, others furtively, but I was con- scious of being the cynosure of all eyes. My embarrassment was visible in' the heightened colour of my cheeks and forehead, which I felt burn -like fire, while I was afraid to trust my eyes to look round. They were all perfectly quiet, and the silence was more terrible to me than noise would have been. As I reached the foot of a fight of stairs, up which the man who car- - ried my trunk had gone in advance, and the tutor after him, I being behind, one of the boys thrust out his foot and adroitly tripped me up, so that I pitched forward upon my hands and one knee upon the three first stairs. I rose instantly to my feet and looked round to see from whom I had received this public insult; for, poor-house boy as I had been, tyranny nor degrada- tion' of position had extinguished in me a certain sense of honour and manliness that prompted me to protect myself from insult 12*     "8  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. or wrong; there was left in me still & spirit as high and bold, kept under as it had been by cruel usage for years, as that which animated the best-born boy around me at that moment, and I felt it, 4 knew, too, that I had a reputation to make, and a position to maintain there. I felt the loneliness of my condi- tion all at once, surrounded by these crowds of boys who knew each other, but who knew me not. I felt my happiness and suc- cess must depend wholly upon myself; for I, unlike the other boys, had no friends to whose name or influence I could look for protection, or honour, or favour. With a spirit wounded by the gross and wanton insult, and roused to resent it, I turned and sought out my insulter. There were but two boys who, from the position in which they stood, only could have done it. I recognised them as the two who had stood by the statue of His- tory, at the head of the flight of terrace-steps. One of them, I' was well satisfied, had thrown me down. I hesitated which to fasten the act upon, when I recollected that the foot over which I had fallen was large and splay. I looked at their feet. One of the boys, the one in black, who was so handsome and aristo- cratic in his looks and bearing, I saw had small and extremely elegant feet. It could not have, been he. I, therefore, knew on whom to fix the quarrel, and as I did not wish there, in the house, the very first hour of entering it, to commit such an of- fence against its quiet as to knock the boy down, I fastened my eyes full upon him, and said in a low tone of voice, and with perfect calmness, You have insulted me-! You are a coward, and I will whip you the first time I catchyou outside of this building.'" Saying these words I went up the stairs, followed by a mur- mur of approbation from several lads who had overheard what I had said. After ascending two flights of stairs, and passing numerous doors leading to the several rooms occupied by the pupils, I came to No. 19, which was a small, but neatly arranged apartment, in the south-western angle of the edifice, being, in P                            "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 149 fact, a room in the octagon tower, and of the dimensions of it. It contained a cot-bed, curtained, a wash-hand stand, with a blue china basin and ewer, a napkin-rack, a table, and small hanging book- case; and above the mantel-piece were two engravings, one of Parnassus Academy, the other of Doctor Brodhead, both of which I recognised at a glance. There were also two high-backed chairs in the room. The two narrow windows or gothic slits opened, one on the town, and the other, to my horror, on the work-house, which was visible about a mile distant across the country, to the south-west. The Irish porter placed my trunk near the head of the cot, and retired, leaving me alone with Mr. Jenks, whom I regarded with feelings akin to awe. He was so grave, so lank, so solemn-look- ing, that I was afraid to open my lips. ,' This will be your num- ber, Master Perry," he said, in a drawling voice, as the man left. "You will remain here till you are classed. They tell me you ,are from the West Indies?" I merely bowed and looked out of the window, which opened towards the city, and from which, also, I caught a glimpse of the entrance gate. I fancied I could detect my aunt's tall figure marching up and down.                 t  "I presume you are well on in your books, Master Perry?" he continued. "You will find this a good place to advance in the humanities." At that moment I was sure I saw Aunt Meg, and. the tears of gratitude gushed into my eyes. I felt a kind touch upon my shoulder. I looked up and saw Mr. Jenks look- ing at me through his small, near-sighted eyes, with an expres- sion of sympathy. He spoke, and said, gently, You are home-sick, Perry. I know what it is to be home- sick! When I first went to a new school I like to have cried cay eyes out, but it only gave me a head-ache. I wouldn't cry; it will only give you a head-ache. Next holidays you will,see your mother again!". "I have no mother," I answered, now really dissolved into ' . '  '     150  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. tears by his kindness, which took my heart and made me love him at once, odd and awkward as he was. "No mother! Then, perhaps," he added, in a soft, soothing way, "then you have sisters and brothers? You will see them again!" "I have no one-I am alone ["I answered. "Then I will try and be your friend, Perry!" "My name is Berry,' I said, still sobbing, while he held my hand like a brother. "I beg pardon, Berry. I feel for you! I will be your friend, if you will have me. I am only an usher here, and you know boys generally hate ushers; but you and I will be friends!" I did not know that boys generally hated ushers, but I felt grateful to him, and told him that I would not hate him. He then said he would leave me, and come for me in a little while to take me about the establishment, show me the recitation hall and dining-room, and study-room, and, as he said, "kind o' familiarize me with the place." When he had quitted me, I shut the door and ran to the win- dow to look after my aunt. I could not now see her; but I could see the scholars distributed about the grounds, some arm- in-arm, as if in friendly conversation, others at foot-ball, others idly lying round on the thick grass. in the indolence of ease; while a few were seated under trees, on benches, studying some delayed task. The quiet beauty of the scene filled my soul with peace, and I inwardly resolved that I would excel the first boy there, if hard study could do it.' I now looked out of the other window, which afforded me a view of the work-house. There it stood, solitary and apart, upon the bleak common, surrounded by its high brick wall, and without a tree to shade it-looking as desolate as it really was. I thought of my poor little comr panions in it, and brought before my mind's eye the terrible forms of Mistress Shirkey presiding in the picking-room, the north window of which I could see from where I was. I imagined the dozen poor little trembling wretches, one of whom I had    "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 151 been, hard at work at their hard tasks, and my heart bled for them. I then thought of my escape, and the events which had transpired since, in the lapse of eight-and-forty hours; and I marvelled-at the thread of circumstances that placed me where I now was; and I felt that I could not do too much to show my gratitude to the extraordinary woman who had bidden me to call her Aunt Meg, and of whom I knew no more-save that I was the object of her kindness and of her magnificent liberality. As I crossed my room I caught the reflection of myself in a looking-glass. I stopped witl surprise and admiration. I was superbly attired indeed, and gazed with pleasure upon my gold- tasselled velvet cap, my blue silk jacket embroidered with gold, my green cassimere breeches, buckled at the knee with brilliants, my white, long stockings, and low morocco shoes, also fastened with handsome paste clasps that dazzled like diamonds. I was a good figure, though slight built, had black hair, and black eyes, and an olive complexion, so that I might very well have passed for a West Indian. I walked up and down two or three times before the glass, when it struck me that I was far more showily dressed than any of the boys I had seen. I then, with an innate feeling of propriety, and a desire not to be singular, felt the wish cross my mind that my aunt had purchased me clothes less splendid and costly. I now heard a carriage roll away, and jumping to the window that overlooked the park, I saw the carriage in which I had come driving rapidly down the avenue. I followed it with my eyes, till, after three or four disappearances under the-covert of the trees, I saw it reach the distant gate. I then beheld my aunt very distinctly as she drew near the window. The carriage stopped full ten minutes, during which time they seemed to be in conversation, and then; passing through the gate, disappeared down the turnpike in the direction of the city. I lost sight of Aunt Meg at the same moment, but I waved her a farewell and wished a thousand blessings on her gray head. If I had had any idea of God, I might have prayed to God to keep her in     152  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERC1VAL MAYBERRY. safety; but I was wholly without religion. I knew nothing of the revelation of Christ in the Gospel; I knew nothing about a Creator of the world and a Judge of men after death. I was in all respects a heathen. Even the two days I was with Aunt Meg, she taught me nothing about my relation to a Heavenly Being, who had made me, and to whom I was accountable for all my actions. The only time in which I had ever reflected at all upon the idea of a heaven or future, was at witnessing the death of little Billy, and hearing his talk. I had no recollection, that could be called a recollection, of having been taught the truths of religion. There lingered in my memory no words of childish prayer, which, if I had ever been taught them, would scarcely have passed entirely out my mind. Mr. Jenks now returned to my room, and surveyed' me, as he had done before, with evident curiosity, as he would have looked at the costume of a Chinese or a Turkish lad, which he had seen for the first time. "Come, Master Berry, if you are ready for a stroll, I will accompany you," he Said, with a pleasant smile in his mild eyes. I thanked him, and said I would go where he wished to guide me; that, as I was quite a stranger to all about the premises, I should be glad to know the ground. We went out together, and as he led me through the gallery, he said, "There are the rooms occupied by the Upper Seniors. They are the older fellows in Homer and Horace. These rooms on the floor we are now descending to are for the Head Juniors- boys who are in the Greek Reader and in Virgil. Perhaps, from your age you will come into this ward, as no doubt you are in pretty much the same books." I blushed and felt deeply mortified at hearing him say this; conscious as I was that I knew nothing at all, and ought to be in a child's class, if there were such an one'there. From this gallery, which at each end was lighted by gothic windows, and ornamented 'with old pictures, and through the   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAVIBERRY. 153 open doors of the rooms of which I could catch glimpses 'of boys at their studies, or fencing, or reading, or smoking cigars, and hear much talking and laughter, I descended to the lower floor of the large building by the steps I had before mounted to my room. The main hall through which I had passed, and in which I had received the open insult, was now nearly deserted, but some half-dozen boys lounging about the front entrance. These, however, eyed me with a good deal of curiosity. From this hall, Mr. Jenks led me to the left, and soon came to a lofty door, which he said,. as he threw it open, "led to the study-hall. But," he added, "it is not now school in." 'It was a vast arched apartment, that looked more like a cha- pel than a school-room. It was fitted up with some hundred and fifty desks, with arm-chairs, and at the farther extremity was a platform, carpeted with green cloth, on which was a large table, and three great velvet chairs, the centre one being tallest, as if for a more important personage than usually occupied the remaining two. I gazed round the large hall admiringly, and the principal points were named to me by the obliging Mr. Jenks. "That large centre chair," he said, as we came to it, is for Dr. Brod- head, the other two for the assistants, myself and Mr. Tarper, the other tutor. That elevated seat in the centre of the school is for the monitor. The bell upon it is to keep order, while the silver bell on Dr. Brodhead's desk- is to call out the classes for recitations. You will perhaps .take one of the desks on this form," he said, "but we will know that, .my friend, when we examine you in your books." I now began to have a horror at i the prospect of this examination, and felt half disposed to escape' it by running away. But I reflected that my ignorance was not my own fault, and that I would remain and trust to my good fortune for the issue." My kind tutor now led me from this noble room across a nar- row passage into another room, quite as long, but neither so lofty nor so handsome. It was occupied chiefly by two very long     154 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. tables set for supper, and benches on which the boys sat at, their meals. The farther extremity was a vast dresser, shining with britannia, and snowy with white ware. It was a neat, cool apartment, and presented, I thought, a striking contrast with the eating-room at the work-house. I noticed that every seat at the table was numbered by a ticket on which was printed in red ink the number of the occupant's room and school-desk. ' This," said my amiable guide,." is the dining-room, the signal to come into which is the ringing of the large bell. There is the number of your room," he added, pointing to a seat on which I saw No. 19 printed. It is fortunately next to Edward Fields's, whom I believe you know!" From this room he conducted-me into a covered gallery, shut in with venitian blinds, where he said the boys exercised in wet weather. At the extremity a flight of stes led into a large play-ground, where gymnastic apparatus of all kinds invited the scholars to healthy recreation. In it were some dozen boys already engaged in their sports, and as many looking on.. All this was novel to me, and Mr. Jenks seeing that I was entertained by their trials of strength and a;gility, said he had duties that called him away and he would leave me here, and when I got tired I could go to my room, and wait there until I was called to be examined and classed. I trembled again at the idea of. this examination, but said nothing, and with a pleasant smile he left me. For the first moment since I had been in the building I was left as it were to look after myself, like any of the other boys. ,But I resolved to appear self-possessed, and to conceal all rmy igno- rance of everything that others knew. I stood and watched the boys for some mninutes, when two or three who had been intro- duced to me by Fields, and whose faces I recollected, came near me, and spoke to me civilly, and asked me if I ever climbed, or wrestled, or ran? I had done all three in my day, but not after "the rules of art" as practised in the gymnasium, and so I replied; at which they laughed, as if my answer had pleased them. All ' '         .' ',    LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 155 ;F .. " .  the while they talked with me, I noticed that it was with an-air of lively curiosity, as if I was a person who, more than other people, was calculated to keep alive this attribute. One of them, a pleasant, good-natured lad, was asking me then some questions about the West Indies, which I was cogitating in my mind how to respond to, when Edward, coming into the yard and seeing me, hastened to speak to me, giving me his hand. - "My mother is gone, Berry, and left good-bye for you-l You know all these fellows, I believe! They are all my friends, and will be yours!" "Can you tell me," I suddenly cried, with a quickening pulse, as I caught sight of the two boys arm in arm entering the play. ground, one of whom had tripped me up with his foot; "can you tell me who that boy is '" "The one in black," answered Edwrd, "is Val My!" "He means Pringle-Victor Pritgle--the one who tripped him up!" interposed another; "foir I heard him 'say Ire woild pay him!"  "Yes, that is the one," I answered; and seeing that th two friends were loitering slowly towards where we stood, I waited till they came near. I saw the stout one, Pringle, point me out to the other, who laughed with him. Without hesitation I advanced 'from the party with which I was standing, and coming up to the two, I stopped full directly in their path, and facing them so that they could not proceed except either by going round me, or putting me out of their way. I heard a murmur of expectation proceed from the thirty or forty boys on the. ground, and the gymnastic performers ceased their sports to survey us. They came up within a remaining step of me, when I 'said, firmly,  "My quarrel is, for the;present, with but one of you. Will vou, sir," I added to the other, " stand aside " "Fair play!" shouted several voices, and the youth, whdom  had heard called Val May, let go the arm of his companion, ail 13     156 IIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. left him standing alone facing me. All was now intense excite- ment in the play-ground. I was a " new boy," and every one had an interest in knowing what I was; for a school-boy's posi- tion among and in the estimation of his fellows, is taken and fixed in his first week, and sometimes in his first hour at school. I was slender but firmly knit together, and light and free in my motions; but I was no practised pugilist, as my readers will very readily understand. I had, however, both courage and pride, and these are a host where physical strength would fail. My antagonist was full three years older and four years larger than I. He was strong-built, thick-set, and had hands fit mates  for the large foot he had caused me to pitch over. His hair was white and soft as carded flax, and he wore it long on his collar as if vain of it. His complexion was clear red and white, and his features halcdsome but vicious, as if he loved violence rather than peace. This was my translation of him as he stood before me; but had I known, as I did soon afterwards, that he was that formidable person, the "Bully of the school," I should not have shrunk from him, but, perhaps, the more desperately nerved myself for the onset. He looked surprised at the bold' attitude I assumed, for he had not for some time seen a boy, such was the terror of his name and fame, that would not rather put up with his tyranny than face him. "Get out of my way, gipsy!" he cried, clenching his hand and glaring on me. "  You publicly insulted me in the hall by thrusting out your elephant's foot and causing me to tumble over it! I told you then I would whip you as soon as I should find you out of doors, and I now intend to do it!" At this address, which I'made loud and distinctly, in a resolute tone of voice, there was a burst of applause, and I knew that I had the sympathies of all the boys on my side. This was a great helper to inspire me. I hd ho sooner finished speaking   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 157 than, making a feint to strike him between the eyes, I put out my foot, and, springing aside as he aimed a parrying blow at me, and so effectually tripped him up that he fell like a bull- calf, striking his head upon the soft tan-bark of the play-ground. This was exactly what I intended, feeling that my pride would be satisfied with nothing less than inflicting upon him the same degradation he had put upon me. The boys who had seen my fall on the stairs, now shouted, and laughed, and clapped their hands.  ' "I have now repaid you in kind what you were pleased to loan me, I said, as he was getting up; "and now I intend to whip you for the insult!" He scarcely waited for me to attack him, -but leaped at me like an enraged lion. Before I could parry. them, I received two sharp and heavy blows in my face, one of  which brought me to my left knee. I recovered myself instantly, however, and assailed him vigorously, wholly heedless of his hits, which nearly killed me, and only trying to demolish him with my own. I hit him in the eyes, nose, mouth, ears, and chest, with such a shower of artillery, striking twice to his once, that he soon began to give way, showing it by dodging my blows, and parrying, rather than trying to make full and direct hits. I felt that I was dreadfully bruised and bleeding, yet I was firmly resolved to die rather than be beaten, and this resolution was, no doubt, very clearly apparent to him in my looks and acts. At length he began to step backwards, and at this retrograde move- ment the air was rent with shouts. :Maddened by these, he tried to grasp me by the throat and clench with me, but I pressed him so closely that I compelled him to the full use-of his hands for the protection of his face. One well-directed blow, into which I threw my whole body, planted between his eyes, sent him reeling with my ruff in his grasp, and in the vain effort to recover himself, he tumbled over upon his side and then rolled upon his face. In an instant I stood upon him with my foot upon his neck.     1558 LIFE AND ADVEN-TURES OF PiRnCJVAL MAYBERRY. "Ask my pardon!' I said, " and I will let you get up, or I will whip yiou till you can't stir!" "I ask it," he said, sullenly, and I instantly removed my fooi and moved back a step to let him rise, amid the greatest imagi- nable uproar of voices around me. I picked up my cap, which had fallen off in the affray, re-arranged my dress, and then turned to rejoin my friend Edward. He was already advancing, hand extended, to meet me, with the whole party I had left. They shook hands with me all round, and many boys I did not know came up and congratulated me and praised my courage. Three or four said they should like me all their lives for having whipped the "bully," and taken, as they remarked, " his conceit" out of him. Pringle, in the mean while, stood alone; not one of his friends having courage in such a moment to approach him, and thereby take share in his disgrace. He stood alone, wiping the blood from his face, and muttering revenge. Edward took me by the arm to lead me to his room, for he said I was too -much bruised to appear before folks until I had washed and re- duced the'swellings in my face. I took his arm and another boy took my other arm, and we Were quitting the play-ground, fol- lowed by a suite of fifty lads, when the head master made his appearance at the top of the steps leading to the verandah. It seems the noise, which he at first thought was applause at some daring gymnastic feat, increasing in loudness, till it at length assumed a fierce and warlike tone, at length induced him to send and see what was the cause of such unusual uproar. The mes- senger, one of the scholars, returned and reported in a high key, as I afterwards learned from Mr. Jenks, that the "New West India boy was whipping the Bully " "Impossible!" ejaculated the doctor, but it were a blessing were it true!" He immedi- ately arose and hastened to the play-ground, as he said to those who followed him, to keep his "foreign pupil" from being beaten to death, as he was sure to be by the pugilist, Pringle. His surprise, therefore, was commensurate with his fears, when he-   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 159 arrived in sight just in time to see Pringle tumbled over on his back and my foot upon him. It was. said the doctor stood for an instant in incredulous amazement; and only gave the com- mand to Mister Tarper, his usher, to part us when I had retired from him. This delay was attributed by the boys to his secret desire to have the fighting boy fairly whipped to the last extreme. Mr. Tarper, therefore, came up and laid his hand upon my shoul- der with a gripe that might have been much milder, and which seemed to me to be unnecessarily severe. This gentleman was about thirty years of age, dapper and nervous, dark-complexioned and jealous-eyed, with a jesuitical look that made his countenance extremely forbidding. There was as much difference between him and Jenks as between a lamb and a serpent. Jenks was the lamb with the wisdom of the serpent, Tarper the serpent without the harmlessness of the. lamb! He was dressed care- fully in blue coat and blue breeches, spotless white hose, shining steel buckles at the knee and on his shoes, and a white waistcoat with gilt buttons, on which was stamped, it being war time, an im- pression of the American Eagle,- to show his patriotism; though no greater lover of England anUdber aristocratic privilegesexisted, and in his estimation no man was a gentleman but a lord. One of the peculiar characteristics of Mr. Tarper's face was a cut across the lower lip, which gave an expression to his mouth that was ex- tremely forbidding, and a tonation to his voice by no means pleasing. The boys said it was a hare-lip, but he asserted that it was a scar he had once received in a desperate encounter with a robber; for Mr. Tarper was given to lying as every scholar in the school knew. "You mill cowe with we to the heal waster," he said in his peculiar mode of articulation, which caused him to sound w like m, and d like 1, and r like wt.. "The doctor won't punish you, Berry," whispered Edward, as he let the usher lead me off. "He is as glad as we are to have' Vic Pringle thrashed l"'.' 13-*.     160  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. I knew I must have broken the discipline of the school by fighting, and I inwardly regretted and felt mortified that my first day at the academy, where kind Aunt Meg had placed me with such hopes of me, should be thus distinguished; I was therefore ready to submit to any punishment the head master  might inflict; as for chastising Pringle, I did not feel any regret at this act, as he had brought it on himself by insulting me in the beginning. Nearly every boy. followed on and crowded the hall, many of thei encouraging me by kind words. Tarper pulled me for- ward so rudely that several of the youths spoke and said, "Shame, Mr. Tarper! You hurt him! Don't you see he is bruised!" But the usher only treated me the rougher. "Tarper likes Pringle, and don't like it because he has been whipped," said another, "and that is the reason he pulls and hauls the new boy so!" "Yes, yes, Tarper is for Pringle!" called out a dozen or more!"Don't mind him, New Boy! Don't care for him, brave Percy"  I didn't care for him, though he hurt me all -he could by screwing my collar with his knuckleh into my throat. We soon reached the Doctor's Library, where this personage had gone before us to await us. I was dragged in and placed before him with a fling. "Not quite so rudely, Mr. Tarper," said the doctor reproving- ly, and in a tone which showed me I had no cause to fear much for myself. The door was now ordered to be shut, but the boys thronged it so that this was impossible, which the doctor seeing ' to be the case, commanded perfect silence among them. He then raised his great blue glasses from his eyes, and rested them on the top of his high forehead, amid the stiff gray hair, and bending a stern glance upon me, he said, imposingly, "So, sir!"  These two monosyllables were followed by a prolonged look, and. an unbroken silence in the door and hall beyond. Tarper   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 161 stood at his left, and looked at me with a fiendish glare of. vin- dictiveness, though I had never injured or seen him before that day; but the boy Pringle was his favourite-favouritism based upon kindred natures, and'therefore I had placed myself in the attitude of an enemy to him. On the good doctor's right stood . Mr. Jenks, in his ill-fitting coat, carelessly tied cravat, and awk- ward air, but with looks of kindness and encouragement fast. ened upon me. "So, sir!" -and at this second monosyllabic ejaculation the worthy doctor frowned, but I was physiognomist enough to know that it was not a frown in earnest, but which, neverthe- less, the occasion demanded. "So, Master Percy Berry, you have made a fine beginning- a rare commencement! But two hours received as a pupil in Parnassus Classical' Academy, and I find you fighting like a, trained pugilist, sir! and instead of taking boys of ypur own size, as. if you were too fond of fisticuff to be content with such sport as these would afford you, you must fasten upon the largest boy in the school, and the Bully at that, sir I Yes, sir ' This boy has the reputation of being the head fighting boy of the school; and herein consists the enormity, the increased enormity of your offence, that instead of whipping lesser boys, you have whipped the bully. This shows clearly that you are naturally so quarrelsome, that a small quarrel, an ordinary antagonist, won't suffice for you; but you must bruise, maltreat, black the eyes and roll over in the dirt, and put your foot even on the neck of Victor Pringle, no longer victor!" Up to this word the boys nor myself could tell whether the doctor was really in earnest, or whether there was not keen irony aimed at Pringle, in his address, rather than censure aimed at me. But this final pun on the discomfited bully's name, was the key to the whole that went before,and there was a general titter and two or three louder guff-haws, from the boys in the hall. "Siwence i" shouted Tarper, looking round, pale with anger.     162  LIFT AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MATBERRY. "This offence, young sir, you have committed," continued the doctor ;'" 'and as there is a law of this school that declares pu- nishment shall be inflicted upon pupils detected in quarrelling or fighting, in such degree a in the judgment of the head mas- ter hb-l 'be requisite; and as we judge no one without giving him a opportunity to defend himself, I demand of you to show good reason why you ought not to receive such chastisement as in my discretion I may direct to be borne by you!" The doctor here ceased, and fnding that there was a general expectation that I should reply, I said: 'I c onfess, Doctor Brodhead, that I have incurred the pe- nalty of the law of the school, and I will not shrink from any punishment, that is not disgraceful, you may order me to suffer. But I wish first to show you that it is not from any natural love of fighting that I am brought before you as a culprit; but cir- cum stances, rendered it necessary that I should whip Master "You are at liberty to state these circumstances," said the doetor. "As I was passing from this room, sir, through the hall, on my way to my chamber," I then began, "'upon reaching the foot of the stairs, Mr. Jenks going before me, and many boys st'nding about, I saw a huge foot, or more properly, hoof, for Scih it seemed in size and shape (here was a titter), thrust out before me. Before I could avoid it I fell over it upon my hands and knees, with great violence, and in the presence of all the boys. "Yes, we saw it we saw him fall'!" exclaimed several voices in parentheses. "Silence, young gentlemen," also at the same time, commanded the doctor.) "Upon getting to my feet and looking round to see to whom the enormous foot belonged," I continued, "I saw but one boy who could own such a member, and from the position in which he stood I was satisfied he had  given me the fall. I therefore whispered to him, and promised him that I would whip him the first time I saw him out of doors; fbrmiy sense of propriety, sir, and respect for your presence, for-   "FE AND ADVENTURES OR PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 163 bade my chastising him in the hall, on the spot, as his conduct towards me deserved. I saw him a quarter of an hour ago walk- ing in the play-ground, and fulfilled my promise, sir! I leave it to your sense of justice, sir, to decide which of us is the ag- gressor, and, at the same time, confess my readiness to submit cheerfully to whatever sentence you may pass upon me." When I had ended my defence, a buzz of approbation came from the hundred and forty boys who crowded the hall and room, and Mr. Jenks catching my eye, smiled with delight, and looked as if he wanted to shake hands with me. "The woy deswerves we sewerest punishwent for his tewerity in carwing such a high haul for a new woy, anl setdig such a dangerwous egsalple to lhe west ow lhe woys in lhe schoodl." "Mr. Tarper will reserve his opinion until it is called for," observed the doctor. ' Master ]perry, In have heard your defence of your conduct. It is. manly, and does you credit. I have no doubt of its entire truth. But the discipline of the school must be enforced. If a law is broken, its penalty must be suffered. Your redress should have been to me for the insult put upon you by Pringle. If every 'boy were allowed to take the law into his own hands as you have done to-day, on every slight provoca'ion, this school mights as well be called Mars Hill, as what it is. I shall therefore express my sense of your offence by ordering you to remain in your room one week, there to study and recite to- Mr. Jenks, and there to receive your meals time sufficiently long, I presume, for your wounds to heal up; for I want to see no bruised heads in the study-hall. As for' Master Pringle, he also has broken a law of this school, by maliciously assaulting. another pupil in tripping him up with his foot. But as he seems to have received sufficient punishment already from the party aggrieved, I shall adjudge him nothing additional!" 'This was spoken with a smile scarcely' concealed. Three cheers were given me as I was conducted from the room by     164  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. Jenks, who had no sooner conveyed me to my chamber and shut the door, than he shook me warmly by the hand, said I' had made everybody my friend, the doctor and all, and that I had nothing to do now but to study hard, in order to take the most enviable rank in the school. He then proceeded to wash my wounds; and admitting Edward, who would come in, these two friends remained with me until after supper, when I fell into a profound sleep, and dreamed that I had carried off the first prize in the school, and that Adlne was crowning me therefor, with a wreath of flowers. CHAPTER VIII. IN. the foregoing chapter, my kind readers, I have given you a narrative of the events which distinguished my first day at Parnassus Classical Academy. If I have seemed to speak too favourably for myself, it is because I have aimed to relate the truth, and I would rather run the risk of being charged with partiality than depart in any instance from the straight line of facts. If, therefore, you shall discover in my autobiography anything that looks like a propensity to place myself well in your opinion at the expense of probability or veracity, you will do me the justice to set it down to the necessity which a faithful account of events necessarily demands, and not to vanity or a spirit of vain boasting. Indeed, the fear of being believed to be too favourable t myself has repeatedly withheld my pen from recording sayings and circumstances which reflected credit upon me, and which, in justice to myself and my readers, I] ought to have recorded. For, how are you to judge of me or of, my cha- racter, to know whether to condemn or praise, to like or dislike me, unless I frankly and impartially let you into the 'secret of   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 165 my thoughts, feelings, wishes, hopes, and aspirations; unless I clearly tell you all I hear said in my favour as well as against me, and make you acquainted with my successes as well as with iny defeats? Trusting, therefore, that for the rest of my narra- tive we shall perfectly understand each other, and write and read in mutual sympathy, I shall now proceed, with good heart, in my history. The sleep into which I had fallen after Mr. Jenks had dressed my hurts continued unbroken through the whole night, and I was only awakened by the prayer-bell at six o'clock in the morning, calling the boys into' the study-hall, which was used as" the chapel. At first I could not clearly make out where I was; but the pain in my face, which was very much swollen, recalled quickly the events of the preceding day. I had not much time to reflect upon them, for the door opened, and the Irishman Terry, in greenish corduroy velveteen breeches, red hose, red waistcoat, and the tail of his blue coat'as broad in the skirts as the letter M, entered softly the room. Seeing me awake, he approached and gazed on me with a look of Commiseration on his rough Irish features, which were throughly Milesian in their mingled intel-, ligence, and humour, and ugliness. "Och," he said, "but it's a brave sight ye are, ma vourneen! But ye giv him a jewel iv a bating intirely. Ye're a young jintleman that'll make the spalpeen Prangle hould his head to the groond he walks on. It's nivermore he'll be the cock o' the warlk.

'"That's the right way to slape after fightin, honey,". he said with animation. "Teddy O'Keefy, o' county Sligo, the greatest baater with his two fists iver was in Ireland, and handled the shillelah as beautiful as iver was seen at Doonbrook fair or any other fair, he tould me he niver slept so dead as afther he'd had a great fight and baat his man! Och, ye'll be after bein a sivinth couzin o' Teddy's rll go an' tell the ould doctor ye sleep like an Irishman afther a waak. He's now in to the prayers, but he'll soon be oot! There, ye hear the young jintle- men rushing. out now. I'll see ye have a nice brikfast; for the docthor don't intind ye shall starve, dear, for ye are here only to get well, and for divil of no punishment at all at all, and this all the young jintlemen know, and the docthor too, Hivin bless his ould gray hairs. Never faar! He's a'true- hearted Irish jintleman, and loves a lad that don't stop to mea. sure the heighth of an innemy like a tailor, but likes it all the betther for his being bigger, coz there's more in him for him to give a baating to!' Terry then pulled his forelock'as a mark of respect, and left me, not a little gratified to find that I had gained so many friends through my conduct the day before. Mr. Jenks soon came in with'a cup of coffee and toast, and expressed the live- liest satisfaction at seeing me so much better. "I came into your room several times during the night," he said in his gentle, almost girlish way, for he had a diffidence about him that belonged more to woman than man, yet which became the simplicity and honesty of his face and air. He dressed slovenly, with coat too large, breeches too small and unlaced, old shoes, and a' cravat without a padding, carelessly knotted about his throat, with the long- ends hanging down, or resting on his shoulder. Plain'-and unassuming, and even awk- ward as he was, he had proved, as I afterwards learned, the best classical scholar in the University where he graduated. 'There was a mild benevolence beaming in his homely countenance, a frank sincerity in every word- he uttered and in the way he   -LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 167 uttered that caused all the right-hearted boys to love him, and would have made every generous woman esteem, if not love him. "I found you always asleep, and was careful not to wake you!" ' You are so good, Mr. Jenks!"I said, pressing his hand. "I have brought you some breakfast. I hope you can eat it. The others are gone in to the breakfast-room."  "And you keep away from your own meal to come to look after me, Mr. Jenks," I said, touched more and more with his kindness and self-denial. "I can eat at any time," he said. Then, at his request, I got up and breakfasted with' a good appetite. I then had my face dressed, and changed my clothes throughout, by his assistance. Seeing him looking through my trunk as if for something, I asked what it was. He replied that he sought for some plainer clothes for me to wear in my room- some loose frock or dressing-gown. But my aunt, in her anii- ety 'to make me fine, and remove me by my apparel as far from my poor-house suit as possible, had neglected to supply me with anything of this description. I saw him look closely at the paper wrapper which contained my work-house suit tied up, and which the Doctor had registered as "one bundle." I had been nervous then lest he should untie it to see what it contained, and I was' now fearfully so, lest Mr. Jenks 'should discover the contents. But he did not attempt -to look into it, and I inter- nally resolved I would destroy it as soon as I got. well enough to carry it off and throw it into some ditch. During the day I was visited by several boys, and especially by Edward, who remained two hours with mne, and told me how highly the boys thought of me,'and that they were all'so anxious, for me to get well and come into the school hall. He told me how Pringle had not yet left his room, and that his power and tyranny in the school were past for ever.  'You have no idea, Percy,'" aid Fields, with indignant ani- mation, in speaking of him, "of the dread that one fellow has "     ]GS  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. inspired here.- Several of the boys, unable to endure his temper and bickerings, aind even his blows, have tried to punish them, but he has always had the victory on his side; so that no others would hardly attempt his chastisement, while he, grown over- bearing and insolent, would sometimes stalk through the play- ground .with a switch, striking the smaller boys with it, and shaking it over the heads of the elder ones of his own age, with a challenging air, saying, "My name is VICTO!, and victor I am! There is not a fellow in this school that I cannot whip!" We had borne his insolence as long as we could, and only yes- terday three of us had agreed together to bear no more, but at- tack him, one at a time; and as soon as he had whipped one, the second take his place, and when he was whipped, the third, by which time we hoped to have exhausted him, and igained a victory, such as it was. But your coming and- your courage, Berry, has done it for us. You can now understand what a ser- vice you have done theboys. Doctor Brodhead would long since have expelled him from the school, but he is immensely wealthy, and belongs to a powerful family, and they say is, a nephew to a cabinet minister or member of the Senate, on his mother's side; though what favour such relationships should entitle an Ame- rican boy to, I can't understand. The doctor, they say, is under some obligations of some sort to his relations. He, however, thinks no less of you for having chastised the boy. I think that the lesson you have given him will either cause him to leave, or make him amicable While he remains." "Who is that youth who seems to be an intimate friend of Pringle," I asked, "whom you called May?' "He is a very different sort of boy from Pringle. It is.' hard to find out his character. He is proud as Lucifer, as aristocratic as a young prince,' and affects a contempt for the most of the boys. He has attached himself to Pringle, either because he courts him for his wealth and rank, or fears him. One thing is certain, he despises him while he associates with him. Pringle. is the only one so blind as not to see that May regards him at   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 169 times with haughty contempt. My opinion is that he is a cow- ard, haughtily as )he. carries himself, and that he makes compa. nionship with the bully, partly to secure his own immunity from his insults, and protection against the rest of his schoolmates, with the best fellows amongst whom he is unpopular. It is said he is rich-the richest boy in the school, and has Spanish blood in his veins. Indeed, he is, without doubt, the only son of a Spanish grandee, whose father ranked as a prince. But there is a mystery about him, and do you know, Berry," added Fields with a smile, " that we all think you look wonderfully like him!"' "Like him?"I repeated. "Yes. Every one speaks of it! If you were dressed alike you. could hardly be told apart, save that the expression of your face is finer and more agreeable. You have the \same' rich raven hair curling about your neck, the same full'brilliant black eyes, the same remarkably elegant figures, small hands and small feet.! You would pass for twins anywhere!" "It is very odd," I said.. "That boy no sooner saw me then he curled his lip at me in a way that' made myblood boil, and he whispered something about my looks or me, to Pringle, at which both laughed, glancing at me sneeringly; whereupon I conceived a bitter hostility. against him on the instant, and it is now so lively, that the least circumstance that occurs hereafter will assuredly bring us into collision." Fields smiled at my warmth, and Doctor Brodhead being at this moment announced, my young, friend rose and left me. The doctor took. a chair, and having taken a huge pinch of snuff from his waistcoat pocket,' which he used as- a snuff-pouch, he looked at me as I sat in the chair opposite to him, and said, with a good-natured smile, "Well, young gentleman, I am glad to hear from Mr. Jenks you are getting along." ' "Yes sir,"'I said, "I am fast improving." "So good, so good! I hope youwill get into no more ,scrapes. The reputation of Parnassus Academy must be kept up. I     170  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. have no objections to a little show of spirit among the lads once in a while, but we must kape the pace--we must kape the pace! You did a very nice bit o' work yesterday, my boy, between yoiu and me; and I do not blame you here in your room for it. Pringle deserved what you gave him, and he will improve in his manners after it. When will you be ready for Mr. Jenks to examine you?" "Whenever he is, sir," I answered, turning pale. "But I fear, doctor, I shall be found very much behindhand!" "Tut, tut!" said he; "a boy so ready with his fists will not be far behind with his books. Ye'll do well enough. Take care of your health, and get down into the study-hall by the week's end, and let me tell ye, Master Percy, ye will always fnd a friend in old Doctor Broadhead." With this assurance, which was in the highest decree grati- fying to me, he shook me heartily by the hand and left me. I continued to mend from day to day, every 'hour being called upon by some one or more of the friends of Edward ]Fields. At length, the fourth day of my confinement, Mr. Jenks entered my room with a pile of books in his arms. As he laid them down, he smiled and said, 'Berry, I have come to examine you, to, class you." If he had said I have come to lead you forth to execution, I could not have been more terrified. I had now quite recovered from the effects of my battle, a slight scar over my eye alone remaining. I was in fine health and spiritsj and quite ready to go to my studies; but 'my time of imprisonment had yet three days to run. I made no reply to Mr. Jenks, but gazed with a look of blank despair upon the books, the contents of which, I was well assured, were a profound mystery to me. He opened one of them, and drawing a chair hear me, said pleasantly, "Now for the screws, Master Berry, but I will not be hard with you, though I question whether you will ask any favours; for it is my opinion you are a capital scholar, and will take a high place in your class."'   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 1 7 What was to be done? All I knew in the world was simply how to read! I had never committed a lesson or studied a book in my life. Of History, Geography, Philosophy, Mathematics, I had never heard. Grammar and Writing;I was wholly igno- rant of! But I felt, justly, that my deficiencies did not proceed from any fault of my own; for if I had had the opportunities of improving my mind, I should have availed myself of them diligently.        V Mr. Jenks opened the book. I saw by the title that it was a Greek Grammar. What kind of a book that was, I had not the most remote idea.  You may decline Toutos," he said. I coloured and looked down. I felt that all the honour and: glory I had won, all the distinction I had gained by my victory over Pringle, was about to be lost by the more complete victory of ignorance over me. "Try Tupto" mildly said Mr. Jenks; "or, perhaps," he added, seeing my confusion, "the noun anthropos is more familiar?" As he said this he looked at me. "I don't understand Greek Grammar," I 'answered, faintly; and I was half tempted to throw myself on his honour and good nature, and reveal all to him; but I remembered my aunt's injunction. "Ah, not studied Greek at all? I am sorry for it-I was in hopes you could go into my Greek class with your friend Fields." He laid the book down and took up another. On the back of it I read "Latin Grammar." I felt the sweat oozing from my fin- gers, for I knew it was to amount to the same thing. He tried me on penna-on anmo-on bonus, and on hic, haec, hoc, but I was silent, too mortified to speak. "Perhaps you do not know Latin, Berry?" he asked, with a look of incredulity.  "I have never studied it, sir," I answered. "I shall have to begin new in everything." "You of course know English grammar well?" he affirmed. "No, sir "       1      .  .  * , .' !     *    ' -.     172 I rE AND ADVENTURES 1O PERoIVAL MAYBERRY. "tistory, or geography?" he added. "No, sir," I responded, with tears in my eyes.. "I fear, Mr.- Jenks, you will have a low opinion of me at this proof of my ignorance; but I lhve never been to school, sir! It has been my misfortune to have had my education wholly neglected. I have never studied, a book, or got a lesson, or been taught anything but to read, in my life. I cannot relate to you, sir, the circum- stances which led to this neglect of me, but the fact exists. I am in hopes, however, sir, that having now been placed here, and with such kind persons, I shall be able, with diligent study, to make up in some degree for my great defects. Don't you think I can, sir?" As I said this, I looked into his face with the most imploring helplessness. He regarded me for a moment with surprise and sympathy, and then taking my hand, said, affectionately: "You have, indeed, surprised me, Berry. I can easily con- ceive, at your home in the West Indies, how you may have been suffered to grow up on your estates without instruction. But those who have had charge of you have done you a great injury. But I trust that it is not irreparable. I feel for you, and more especially, that when your ignorance shall be made known, you will lose that popularity and esteem in which you are now held, and also give occasion for Pringle to be impertinent!" "I am half-disposed, sir, to leave the school," I said, deeply mortifed at this prospect. "'No. You shall remain here, Berry 1" he said, very deter- minnely. "I have taken a deep interest in you and your welfare. If you will second me by very hard study, I think we can, by and by, get out of this difficulty and set your ene-mies it defiance." "I will do anything in the world you advise, sir," I said, my eyes sparkling with tears of gratitude to this good young man. He took up another book, and placed it in my hand. Let me hear you read; I can then tell what wecan do for you." When I Ialdead half'a page, he laid his hand on my shoulder, and said with delight: ,  .  *    .:   T IFt AND ADVENTUr ES OF PERC1VAL ,MAYBERRY. 173 "That will do 1 You read well enough. You can, therefore, study anything. Now listen to me carefully. The four studies you should have attended to in your proper class this session, are Virgil and the Greek Reader, arithmetic, the history of Europe, and geography, with writing. Can you write?"i ' I can print," I said, and at his request printed the name of the book I had read in. He looked at it and smiled, and said, "Well, this will do! You will soon turn this into writing. And I will tell you what you must do. You will have to study very hard indeed for a few weeks. I shall give you double and treble lessons. For instance, the lesson in history for to-morrow at eleven o'clock, comprisesethese four pages. Can you study them?"I told 'him I would try. "The lesson in geography, is seventy of these questions: I will show you how to get the les- son. Now, in addition to these daily tasks, you must begin the two ,books, and go over them to me in daily recitations privately in your room here; so while you are going on with the class into which I shall put you to-morrow, you will be bringing up what  they have already gone over. As to writing, I will giye you les- sons here every day, beginning to-day. As for your Latin and Greek, I shall set you lessons in the grammars at once, and I will at the same time teach you privately a few lines of each reci- tation, after we have learned the Greek characters, which we can master in a couple of hours.'  In this generous manner, this best' of ushers planned my course in the school with a delicacy and kindness, that almost  made me feel like worshipping him. The sawn hour he set me a lesson in writing, and carefully watched my progress in the: formation of each letter. He. taught me the Greek alphabet by making me copy it, and :by the time I was ready to go to bed, I had made upwards of twenty copies of it, till every letter was familiar. I then proceeded to study out and pronounce the Greek words in my part of the lesson for the next day. I also went over the five lines of Virgil which were to come to me, and     - 1 74 LIFE AND ADVENTURES O PERl] VAL MAYBEIRRY. which he had translated for me. He had also, during that hard- working day, taught me the object and use of maps, and the ge- neral form of the:earth and its distribution into continents, oceans, islands, &c. He, in fact, anticipated and explained every diffi- culty which my first lessons would present to one in my peculiar circumstances; and having committed to memory my history lesson, and all the questions in the geography lesson, I took hold of my Greek and Latin with more confidence; but the two last puzzled me, and almost made me despair; but I trusted to my friendly tutor's aid in the morning. It was after midnight when I sought my pillow, after having studied full nine hours without cessation, and instead of dreamingof Anne, I dreamed first of trying to stop the world's turning round, lest the waters of the ocean should spill out; and then of Julius Caesar building a bridge of boats across a river; then of making honey and being stung by Virgil's bees, for the lesson had been in the Georgics; and I woke myself up declining the Greek article hos, he, ho! As I was to keep my room that and" two other days, it was a fine time to study. My true friend, Mr. Jenks, was with me in due time, and with extraordinarypatience heard me say all my lessons. He expressed himself perfectly delighted with my suc- cess, and gave me every encouragement. He then watched and directed me in writing, and in one hour explained clearly to my understanding, the principles of the first four arithmetical rules, and gave me the multiplication table to commit to memory and to copy, to make me familiar with the use of figures. This day's work was very hard, and I scarcely took time to eat the meals brought up to me. At night Mr. Jenks came to see what I had done, and praised me greatly. He said my me- mory was extraordinary, not surpassed by any boy's he had ever seen; and that I should soon be able to say my lessons in the classes as well as I said them to him; " for,"' he added, "what you have achieved here is a guarantee to me of your triumph in the study-hall."  A t length the week of my "punishment" passed, and I re- At legt   .h weko a    -IIPF AND ADVENTUI'J.3 OF "PE1i'VAL MAYBRitY. 175 ceived an order from Dr. Brodhead to make my appearance at meals and at recitations with the other boys. . When I descended into the hall, where all the boys were at their desks, my appear- ance caused a sensation, and many a welcoming smile greeted me. I was conducted to my seat by Mr. Jenks, and as it was near Fields's, I felt very happy. In the recitations of the day, all of which I had carefully been \prepared for by my kind teacher, I acquitted myself with such distinction that Edward said, Why, Berry, you will be victor with your books as well as with your fists!" and Doctor Brodhead wag pleased to say that "I had acquitted myself uncommonly well, and he had high hopes that I should, by my scholarship, reflect the highest honour on his academy." The reader will have now seen, that, in spite of myself, I was sailing under false colours; that I was regarded as a wealthy West Indian (though, for what I knew, I might have been), and I was receiving praise which was due only to Mr. Jenks, though I was deserving some little credit, certainly, on the score of hard study and honest endeavours to avail myself of the extra- ordinary advantages his regard for me placed within my reach. Nevertheless, I felt a weight on my conscience, and was painfully conscious of a concealment and deception that was unworthy one who loved and honoured truth. When I retired to my room that night, I was much troubled at the equivocal position I held, not only as to my birth-place, but in my studies. Every lesson I recited was a fraud, and I felt it to be so. But I had no other alternative. I was entangled in a web from which there was no extrication but by time. I consoled myself with the reflection that the necessity of this fraud in my recitations would be less- ened daily, as I grew more independent of the assistance of the gopo usher; and in the excellency of the end I tried to endure the self-degradation of the means. "In six months, at least," I said to myself, "I shall be able to go on alone in Greek and Latin, and in less time in my other studies."     176  LIFE AND ADVrENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. I, however, gave myself too much time to depend on Mr. Jenks. In less than three months I had so mastered such por- tions of the Latin and Greek grammars, as he had specified that I was not only able to get my lessons alone, but to get the whole lesson and be taken up anywhere, like the rest; and happy was I when I could, at least, go to a recitation without a " packed lesson," that is, with only a certain part studied on which the tutor was to take me up. My progress gave the greatest satisfaction to my excellent friend Mr. Jenks, who; said, " that the extraordinary result, so triumphantly complete, fully repaid him for the amount of time he had devoted to me." I had been in the academy about five months, and being now independent of private tuition, I felt much better satisfied with myself, and had nothing now to trouble me but the necessity of permitting everybody to believe that I was a native of the Island of Cuba; but 'the reader will remember by what singular acci- dent, if I may so term it, my nativity was there cast. During the five months I had neither heard of nor seen Aunt Meg. But let it not be supposed that I had forgotten her;'on the con- trary, I thought of her with more affectionate gratitude than 'ever; for I was happy, I was improving my mind, I was popu- lar in my class and in the school, loved by Mr. Jenks, and well liked by Dr. Broadhead; and all these sources of happiness had sprung from her munificent kindness to me. My position with reference to Victor Pringle had not changed. He remained still at the school, but we never met on speaking terms. He always regarded me with sullen hate, while I never deigned to notice him. His influence over the school was never regained, and he appeared to remain in a sort of disgrace. The' intimacy between him and May had ceased from the day of our battle, and the latter ,had never been seen to speak to him since. But his contempt for the beaten did not place the conqueror in favour with him. He always, on the contrary, manifested a cool                   .-   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 1" and deliberate dislike for me, which would never allow him to join a group of boys where I was, nor remain with a group which I approached. ,'This marked hatred was observed by the whole school, and as they saw, that I did not share it, but only smiled at its exhibition in him, they frequently asked me, especially Ed- ward and Mr. Jenks, what I had done to draw on me" his dislike. But I could only profess entire ignorance, and finally it ceased to be spoken of or noticed, any more than any other constnt and regular phenomenon. May had his friends, but they were not among the cleverest boys of the school; indeed, he was a sort of leader of a party, and Edward Fields might be oonsidred at hit antagonistic chief, as he was also a popular head of another and much th6 largest and cleverest body of the pupils As Edward and I still continued warm friends, I was of course of his party, and more or less hostile to May and all who favoured him. Tarper and May were fast friends. One day, after I had been there about five months, I was waik- ing down the avenue alone in thedirection of the gate. I was not a little troubled in my mind; for Edward had frankly explained to me the reason of a certain coldness I had noticed for a day or two past, in four or fivel of the boys whom I had regarded as my friends, and also of certain curious glances which, I had observed, had taken the place of the confidence of which I had been the object. "Why, it is some idle story of May's," said Fields laughing. "It has been going about for three or four days. Ever since that visit" (of which I will speak soon) "of the lady and her pretty daughter, May's cousin." ' What does he say?"I' asked, with a blanched cheek. "He says you are an impostor, a runaway from the poor- house, and it's all sham about your being born in Cuba, and being rich, and all that! But nobody believes him but his own set." I felt, when I heard this, as if I should sink with shame and rage. My heart ceased to beat! I trembled till my knees M Y,  f     178  LIFE AND XDVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. knocked together. I felt the sweat stand in drops upon .my brow. I could only utter "Thank you, Fields-thanks for not believing all you hear!" and I left him. It was just after tea, and the sun was still half an hour high. All the boys were at their sports, or scattered about the grounds at leisure. I took my way along the avenue, alone and utterly miserable. I knew how much truth there was in all I had heard! I felt that my destiny was fixed, that I was henceforth disgraced and an outcast.- In the most distressing state of mind, in which I feel every one bf my readers will sympathize, I walked along the same avenue by which, in the carriage of Edward's mother, a little less than six months before, I had approached the academy. I thought of what I was then -what six months of study and intercourse with the teachers and scholars had made me. I bent down my head and wept like a child. The tears rained on the dust at my feet as I walked on, scarcely knowing whither I went, but feeling as if the farther I could get from the school the less my wretchedness would be. ' How-how could that bitter enemy of mine, he of all others, come by this news?"I asked myself a hundred times. "Have I been recognised here? Has Shirkey discovered me, and reported this to my shame in revenge?" All was mysterious and painful. I had been careful never to leave the grounds, for, fear of being recognised by Shirkey or others, yet that I was known could not be denied by me! "What, oh what," I asked myself, ringing my hands in anguish, "what will be the consequence of this? It will end in the ruin and shipwreck of all my hopes! I shall be scorned, I shall be despised; even Edward Fields will shun me, and I shall lose the esteem of Mr. Jenks. The doctor will be angry with me, too, for he will say I have brought disgrace upon his school!" Such were my reflections, and dark and sad enough they were! Well did I know the estimation work-house orphans were held in, by the manner in which I heard the work-house and its   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF' PERCitVAL MAYBERRY. 1 9 inmates spoken of by the boys, some of whom had gone so far as to say they considered it the only drawhack to the' entire respectability of Parnassus Academy that it should be so near-- a mile distant-to the work-house! and the children of this public charity I had heard named with derision and contempt, and classed with chimney-sweeps and beggars. My crime, there- fore, in bringing a poor-house orphan, in my own person, into this aristocratic institution, forced itself upon me in all its colours. It would, however, be difficult to describe fully the state of mind into which the' reflection that my former life had been dis- covered, threw me. What perplexed me most, was how the news should reach May's ears. I felt that I would rather have it known to anybody else than to him. Vexed, grieved, mortified, and troubled, and hardly knowing how I should act under the circumstances, I took my way down the avenue, now moving rapidly, impelled by the heat of my mind, now slowly, and sometimes standing still, in cooler delibe- ration upon my darkened prospects. There were other boys visible, walking or playing among the trees; and, as none of them were near me, I fancied they kept. away from me from design. At length, as I drew near the gate, which had been hidUen from me by a winding in the road, I heard voices, shouts, and laughter, and scornful hootings. Approaching nearer, I came upon a group of boys who were looking through the gate at some person whom they seemed to be making sport of, or rather, whom May was making sport of, while they applauded. I was about to turn aside to avoid this set, when I recognised through the gate the form and gray head of Aunt Meg. My first impulse was to run forward and welcome andembrace her; but this feeling was checked instantly by the reflection, that if I were seen speaking to such a strange person, the runours of my low origin and life would certainly be corrobo- rated. She also appeared to me more outre and' peculiar in her 15     180  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. dress and appearance than I had ever before thought her to be. So I was turning away, I confess it with shame, turning away from her, when I heard May call her an epithet that made my ears tingle, and say, ' You want to see Percy Berry, do you? Oh, I dare say you are his mother? You see, boys, who his relations are that visit him-! A West India planter's son! A poor-house beggar's brat!"  I could hear no more! My spirit was roused! I felt that I was not guilty of bringing about the circumstances that environed me, and that I would face them like an innocent per- son, with courage and resolution. "Away with cowardice! Away with this base fear!"I said, half aloud to myself. "I have done no wrong, and I will not act like a culprit. If I have been in the Poor-house, I will not think less of myself, nor shall they think less of me!" Arming my soul with this armour of courage, I resumed my way to the gate, which the boys so closely besieged that my aunt could neither get in nor over 'it. I saw that she tried to keep her temper, as if she would not compromise me, whom she was going to visit, by any violence. As all the boy's backs were turned towards me, I was very near the gate before I was seen. As soon as I'was recognised, my name was called out, and my aunt fixed her eyes upon me, as if she did not fully recognise me. At length, she said with unaffected joy, "It is he-it is my brave boy!" "Hear her! She says Berry is her boy!" called out three or four of the partisans of May, in tones of derision. "Yes, like mother like son," sarcastically remarked May. "Stand aside, fellows, and let us see the meeting between mother and son! Every one take out his pocket-handkerchief, for'I anticipate a very affecting scene  Not a word of this escaped my ears. With a sentiment of manly independence that scorned them and their conduct, with a resolution that rose superior to every low consideration, I went [   "FE AND ADVENTURES OR PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 181 straight to my aunt, the boys, like cowards as they were, giving way on either hand; and opening the gate, welcomed her with both hands. She gazed in my face a moment, and seemed to be ad- miringly noting the improvement in my height and appearance. This is a blessed day, Percy, that I see you again! . I could not keep away from you any longer! How tall you have grown, and how like your father, and your beautiful mother, too! I have heard. from you from time to time; no matter how, but I could not deny myself the sight of you another week. You have rude boys here-rude fellows! As I tried to get into the gate, these lads came about me and mocked me, and when I fixed my eyes on that one, and asked if it were you, I was pelted by him with stones; for in truth he looks like you won- derfully; butrsince I see him closer, it is that kind of likeness that a base counterfeit may have to the original-or a devil to an angel! The likeness is wonderful," she added, glancing again steadily at May. "What is his name?" "Val May," I answered, "probably Valentine May ;" for other than by one or both of these monosyllables, I had never heard him spoken of, and supposed it was his full name. "Val-May-May-Val-" repeated my aunt, as if to her own reflections; "and this resemblance, too! It is very strange!" And she bent such a scorching gaze on the youth, that he coloured and looked confused, and cursed her to her face. She smiled grimly at this, and I heard her say, "He is liker now, with that frown! Curse away, young man! I and thou will know one another better than we do, ill as has been our meeting this evening!" These words were spoken in such low, thrilling, mysterious tones, and with such a lightning glance of her eyes upon him, that he grew pale, and stood gaz- ing upon her with blanched cheeks. "Don't fear the old witch, May," cried several of his com- panions. "Let me alone! I fear her not. She is, I believe, a devil-      182  LInE AND ADVENTURES OF PErOCIVAL MAYirnYRRY. Let us leave her!" and with manifest trepidation, he placed his hand in the arm of one of his friends, and walked rapidly away from the gate. "Coward! I always thought May was a coward " said one of the boys. "I am not afraid 'of the old woman!" . "But I will make you afraid of me," I said, resolutely. (' ay another insulting word, and I will give you a sound chas- tising." "Don't trouble them, Percy! come with me up to the school. I wish to talk with thee." I had no reason to repeat my threat, so far as my. aunt was concerned, for the boys retreated; but at a safe distance they called to me, and cried, "Poor-house scholar! Work-house brat! How large a su- gar estate has your father left you in Cuba? We'll have you hooted out of the school! Sweep-ho! Have you any cold-vit- tals?"Such were the cries with which they insulted me, or rather tried to insult me, for I had firmly made up my mind not to be insulted by anything that should be said to me, but to bear all, till I could clear up the cloud that overhung me. My delight was, therefore, very great to have Aunt Meg arrive just at that time, the time of my despair; for I had a secret assurance that it was in her power to place me in a true and honourable position before Dr. Brodhead and the whole school. We walked on until we could no longer hear the voices of the boys. My aunt at first was silent, walking on with her eyes fixed upon my face, without changing its expression of mixed love and sadness. We came to a side-path, which led into a copse where were placed seats. Seeing that this place was free from intruders, she turned down this walk, and bade me follow her, with a sign of her finger. When we reached the seclu- sion of the copse she sat down, and looking carefully about, to see that no one could overhear, she said, impressively "Percy, I have a good deal to say to you! I did not expect to have to reveal what I am about to do for some years yet; till you were older; but I may die; and I have this last half-hour   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 183 heard words that must hasten the time to make known to you 'what you should learn for your own honour and security. We are alone here?" At this moment the bell for evening prayers tolled, and I informed her that the grounds would in a few mo- ments be quite deserted. "So much the better, my dear child. You have been insulted; I heard it! Your story is found out; but I knew it before I came here to-day." "Knew it before, Aunt Meg?"I repeated with surprise. "I only knew it an hour ago, though I have suspected something for two or three days past, that has made me feel uneasy about my terrible secret."' "I knew it, Percy, and this brought me here to see you, for' I knew the difficulties that you would. be surrounded with, and I came to your relief." "A thousand thanks, dear Aunt Meg!"I said, kissing her hand; "and yet will you forgive me for feeling ashamed to be recognised by you before so many boys?" "I will forgive you anything, my dear child," she said, with a tenderness that made me half suspect, with a secret dread lest' it should prove true, that this strange, generous person might be my mother; but then I recalled the vivid funeral-scene-the hollow sounding coffin, and deep grave of my mother, and dis- missed the suspicion.  "How did you learn that my secret was knownj dear aunt?" I asked, earnestly. In this way," she replied. "You must know, that after I leftyou here, I returned to my home on the island. There I was not long alone, for a ship soon came in and left small-pox patients under my charge. These kept me too busily employed for three months to enable me to quit the island; but there was a fisherman, who had ha4 the small-pox, who occasionally came to the island to sell me fish; and I gave him money to take fish ,to the school here, and ask about you of the servants, secretly; and he brought me brave accounts of you, and said everybody ,          .\     184  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAFBERRY. loved you. He said he had spoken with you, and you had done him service, my boy." "I have seen a fisherman here, and one day,* as his basket was taken from him by some of the vicious boys, I recollect I recovered it and restored it, with all the fish in it, to him," I said. "Yes, he spoke of it gratefully, and I knew by this you were noble, and brave, and all I could wish; for onfe action is enough to tell what .a boy's character is!" said my aunt, with- warmth. "After I had been three months kept on the island, the end of the sickness gave me a little liberty, and I resolved to come and visit you, and see if you wanted anything. So, in order not to bring disgrace on you, I dressed myself with great care, which, in my haste to get here to-day, I did not think to do, and came to the city. As it was early in the day, seeing the work-house before me, I thought I would walk on and call there. I found Shirkey and his wife in ill-humour. I asked about the boy Dick, your companion, as if I were related to him. At this both of them grew red, and said he had run away with another boy, and had not been heard of; but they were glad they were gone, as they were very troublesome boys. I asked then who was Dick's companion, and they named you, and spoke of you with great hatred, which I let them do. I asked if they had heard from you. They answered no, but they once thought they had you, for they heard from a servant at the Big School that there was a boy there by the name of Percival Mayberry. Not knowing how a poor-house boy could get there, Shirkey, however, made out to get sight of him, and found, that though it was the same name, and looked like the runaway Percival Mayberry, that it was a different person, and he learned that he had been in the school full two years, which rendered it impossible he should be the same, notwithstanding the likeness and name." "Who can it be, aunt?"I asked, with surprise. "There is no boy of that name here, but me." "Yes, there is, and I have seen him. It is the boy whom I                          *O   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 185 heard called Val May. His name is full, Percival Mayberry, you may be assured, and he is the boy Shirkey supposed might possibly be you." "I have never heard him called by any other name than May," I said.  "It is a nickname," answered my aunt; "a nickname without doubt. He could tell you his name is the same as your own." 'So many boys here have nicknames," I said, "that there are several now, whose real and complete names I do not know. But how surprising that we who hate each other so, should look. alike and have the same name!" "It is not surprising you should be foes," said my aunt, impressively, and with a look of dark meaning. "Listen to me," she added, while I sat overwhelmed with amazement at this new discovery touching the real name of May, and half disposed to question the certainty. "I then asked Shirkey when you came there? He said you were placed there by a gentleman seven years ago, who showed him an order from the overseers of the poor. As I had made both him and his wife afraid of me, by threatening to make a complaint against them for suffering Dick to escape (for I feigned to come to see about Dick, and not you at alD, they were civil, and readily showed me the order, which was signed by one of the selectmen, who is now Mayor of the city-a noble gentleman. Having got this'clue, I was very well satisfied; but I would not leave the place until I had named 'little Billy,' and asked if he had also run away. They caught the idea in an instant, and both answered 'yes,' in the same breath. I smiled bitterly upon the lying hypocrites, and, rising up, said, sternly, 'He is murdered then since! for his little white ghost walks! Have you not see 'it? Do you not hear it o' nights when the wind howls! It walks by the brook- bank, and sits at midnight uipon a flat rock there, and moans, and calls on God to punish its murderers! ' They both started to their feet, and looked conscience-stricken, and terrified beyond their wits. They gazed on me as if I had '         - ,.;      S  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. been a spirit! I said no more, but rising, marched from their den, which I cursed for your sake as I crossed its threshold. They will never forget me nor little Billy!" added my aunt, with an expression on her face that is indescribable. CHAPTER IX. AUNT MEG having remained a moment or two silent, as if to calm her indignation, thus resumed her narrative: "Upon leaving the work-house, where I had learned all touch- ing your going there that they could give me, 1 was returning straight to town to see the Mayor, and ask him who had called on him with the order I held in my possession; when, as I was going along, thinking and not heeding anything, I found myself suddenly in' front of a pair of large horses, which the driver was trying to rein up in order to prevent running over me, while he called to me with'all his lungs, to get out of the way, I being, as usual, in the centre of the highway. But I saw and heard too late, for the chest of one of the horses struck me full on the right shoulder, and I was violently hurled with a whirling motion to the earth, and they hardly prevented the wheels of the carriage completing what their horses had done. As I fell, I heard a wild cry, as if from a young girl--a cry of pity and terror, that showed she felt for my danger with her whole heart. I was deprived of my senses by the fall, and when I came to myself, I found that I was lying on a handsome sofa, a white linen pillow beneath my head4 in a richly furnished apartment, and surround- ed with all the signs of wealth and rank. At first I could not believe, that I was alive, the change from the bleak, dusty road to this place being so instantaneous. I had no sooner opened aty eyes, than I saw run to my side a lovely child of ten years   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 187 of age, who, taking me by the hand, smiled'in my face, and said, with a joyful exclamation, "' (Oh, you are better, Come, mamma, she is well again, and won't die! oh, I am so happy! Don't you feel better?' she asked, so winningly, that I could have clasped the dear child to my' heart. "'Yes,' I said, 'yes, I'am well now.' ' Her mother, at the same moment, advanced with a quick, affectionate step, to where I lay, and asked me how I did, so kindly, that I felt that I was with good and generous people. Her voice, however, affected me strangely, and when I fixed my 'eyes upon her features, I could not restrain an exclamation which repeated her name! She started, but I instantly recollected' myself, and said, "Madam, I thank you for your kindness. I have been hurt, but I do not know how I came here!' "'You were walking along the road,' said the lovely girl, 'and we were driving very rapidly, when I heard James, the coachman, shout, and on looking out of the carriage window, I saw you in the road, directly in front of the horses, walking, with your eyes bent down. I saw you did not hear him; and telling ma there was a deaf and blind woman in the way, the next moment I saw you struck and thrown down!' "'The coach was stopped instantly, and we at once alighted to your assistance,'.said the lady; 'and finding you senseless, I ordered you to be placed in the carriage, and driven at once to my house. I have sent for my physician, who will be here directly.'  "I thanked both the lady and her daughter for their kindness and humanity in thinking so much of a poor foot-passenger, and told them I should hardly 'need a doctor's attention. While I was speaking, and as I set up, the physician entered. He no sooner saw me, than he exclaimed, 'What, Meg of the Pes't Island!' "a Who?' repeated the lady.     1 8  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.             l "The doctor, who had been to the island more than once when distinguished patients had been taken there, then ex- plained that I was the nurse in the Plague at the Pest-Island. "'It matters not,' said the lady, slightly shrinking; 'we ran over her as we were driving out, and I had her brought here and sent for you. You will be so kind as to see if she is hurt.' "To this I replied by standing upon my feet, and assuring her that I was not the worse. I then told her I regretted she should have brought into her house a banned woman like me, when her daughter said,. "' We had injured you, and it was our duty to protect you, no matter who you are, good woman. I am sure there is no danger from her, doctor?' 4"'None at all,' answered the doctor, who was a sensible ian, and who shook me by the hand; " there is no disease on the island now! I am glad, Meg, that you who have served so many, are not in need now of my services. Your pulse is pretty in, a little quick, perhaps; you will do well if you hove no boqeg broken. When you walk a road again, you must not take up the whole of it.' "I uow determined to go away, but in trying to walk, I felt a aevHra pain in my shoulder, and the doctor, seeing the expres- sion of anguish on my face, examined and found that my collar- bone was broken. At this announcement, the lady insisted I should have a room prepared, and by the doctor' orders I was conveyed to it. Here for five weeks I was confined with fever and pin, and will you believe it, all this time I was as tenderly nursed by the lovely girl as if I had been a born queen 1" "It must have been Anne!"I exclaimed with enthusiasm. "I have thought so all along." Upon this my aunt fixed her large eyes upon me with a stare of surprise. "Yes," she said, that was her name!"But, my by, where- have you seen her?" I blushed and hesitated, but, urged by Aunt Meg, I made known to her the history of my knowledge of her; and as I   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 189 told it I could not hide from my aunt's penetrating observation the secret of my heart's devotion to her. She listened with close attention till I had ended, and then taking my two hands in hers, she said fervently, as she pressed them together, "Heaven directs all this! Blessings on you both, my dear boy! This will all come zut right, at last. Yes, it was Anne, the, same, without doubt, you have spoken so freely to me about, and you are the boy-the poor-house boy I have heard her. speak of." "Speak of me?"I exclaimed, with a glow of joy. "In my sickness," said my aunt, "she would try to amuse me with everything she knew or had seen. One day she men- tioned that they were riding, at the time I was run over, to the work-house, to return a girl they had taken from there, who did not suit her mother. I then asked her if she had visited that place, when she gave me an account of the very visit you have spoken of; ard she told me about you and yourspirit, and how much-she thought of you, and how she pitied you, and wished from her heart you were not a poor-house orphan; for she thought she should like you very much if you were a young gentleman., All this while my heart told me she was speaking of you, Percy, but as she could not tell me the name, and only described you, I was not sure: But now I am certain, and my heart is over- joyed at it all; for it is as it should be! How wonderful events turn out! You have done right to remember her, my dear boy, and I hope you will continue .to cherish her in your heart; for things of great importance may grow out of it. How very strange!" added my aunt, as if deeply moved by what she had now discovered. "I begin now to see through the dealings of a mysterious Providence, and by and by all will come to light, as it should do." "Who is Anne? what is her other name?"I asked my aunt. "Itis Anne Linn. But you must ask no more questions now. Listen to me. After I had been at that house five weeks, I was well enough to leave. But I had learned while there that I was     190  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL BMAYBERRY. at the very residence of the Mayor, which 1 was going to seek, when I was run over. He knew me as soon as he came home the first day, and came in, from time to time, to ask after me. When I got well I sought an interview with him alone, and placing the order of seven years' back date in his hand, I asked him to whom he had given it. He had to recall the circumstances, and then said, that a gentleman, who looked like a naval officer, about thirty-five years of age, had brought you to him, saying that you were the son of a poor woman, who had died on his ship, and he wished you to be taken care of by the authorities, promising to pay fifty dollars per annum. ' After some discussion by the Board, in the presence of the child, the application was granted, and that is all I know about it,' added the Mayor, 'save that the fifty dollars has been paid annually to the treasurer, as agreed upon.'  "And what was this stranger's name, aunt?"I asked, with deep interest.  "The Mayor could not tell me-he left no name, but from his description I know him-I know him!" repeated Aunt Meg, very positively.  "May I know, Aunt 'Meg?"I asked. "I wish you would unfold something about me, that will let some little sunshine fall upon the clouds that to-day encompass me!" "You shall know all in good time, Percy," said my aunt. "I 'have learned much to your advantage. I will now tell you how I heard that it had been found out you had been in the work- house." At this name my ears tingled again, but I listened with patience. "This morning I was in the town, intending to make sonme purchases and presents to send to you by the post-man, but not to come and see you myself, for I wished to keep away as long as I could, knowing you would not be honoured among your fellows by a visit from such an odd creature as your Aunt Meg, when, as I was going past the elegant mansion of the Mayor, where I had been so kindly treated, I saw at the window the v'  .     + ,   Z^iE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 191 young girl, Aniie. She no sooner saw me than she nodded and smiled, and tapped on the window for me to stop. I obeyed her, and went up the marble steps, when she opened the door, and putting out her soft, white hand, shook mine as affection- ately as if I had been one of her most aristocratic friends. "' Come in-you must be tired, Aunt Meg' ( for I had told her also to call me so), she said, pulling me by my cloak; and I went in and sat down in the hall. She then brought me a glass of wine, and cake, and made me eat the one, and drink the other. She then asked me where I was going. I told her I was making purchases for a little friend of mine whom I wished she could know; not suspecting then, Percy, that you knew her, or ever remembered the little lady who had called at the work- house. - "She asked me a dozen questions about my favourite, as I called you, but I would not tell her anything; but asked her if she remembered the black eyed, curly-headed boy at the poor-house. She said ' Yes, indeed, she did,' and added with great enthusi- asm, 'I have seen him again, Aunt Meg, and you can't guess where!' "I told her I could not, 'though I began to suspect and fear, when she answered, "'At the Parnassus Academy!'" ' It was she I then saw, but was not sure, as her face was turned from me," I exclaimed. "They told me she was a cousin of May's or Mayberry's, and I did not notice her." "But she noticed you, Percy," said my aunt; " she drove there with her mother to see this boy (who falsely; yes, falsely, passes for her. cousin), and there she told me she saw you standing at a window!" "Yes, in Jenks's room', I said. "She says she knew it was you, and expressed her surprise and pleasure to her cousin at seeing you." "'Where did you ever see Jiln, efore?' he asked her quickly and suspiciously.     192 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. She then told him that she had seen you at the Poor-house, picking oakum (here I covered my face with my hands, and groaned bitterly), and ihow glad she was to find you out of that filthy place, and become a scholar in Parnassus School." It is all clear now, all clear enough, how May heard it!"I said with anguish. "But I do not blame her-no-not for a word! She spoke it in kindness, aunt! She knew not the mis- chief she was doing." "But cheer up, the mischief is not irreparable, by any means," answered my Aunt Meg, laying her hand kindly and encourag- ingly upon my shoulder. "It will all come out bright at last, to the confusion of your enemies " "It is impossible I should ever recover from this blow! Not a boy in school will speak to me! I shall have the finger of scorn pointed at me! I can never get over it," I cried in deep distress. H' That she-that Anna should be the cause of it! But it is more endu- rable at her hands than from any other." I then covered my face in my good aunt's cloak, and wept, perfectly heart-broken. She suffered me to give vent to my feelings for a moment or two, and then said cheerfully, "Take courage, Percy. I have it in my power to make all right again, to place you higher than ever! Let your foes tri- umph to-day. To-morrow, victory will be yours. When I had heard the account 'of her visit here, I saw at a glance, the mis- chief of which she had unintentionally sowed the seed. I sighed for you, but I also felt triumph for you, if any disgrace should come of it to you. I feared it might be told to your injury; but had I known who the person was who heard it, as I now know, and that he is your enemy, I should have been certain of the use he would have made of the power he had gotten over you. I at once made up my mind. I had an interview with her mother, who signed a paper for me which I solicited of her; and I obtained other papers from the Mayor. I then went to two other persons, whom I had not seen for years, to whom my visit, startled as they were to behold me, was most satisfactory ',    "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 193 in its results. All this has consumed nearly the whole day, and I hastened to your assistance as soon as I could, to furnish you with means to discomfit yOur foes, should you become a sufferer through the intelligence conveyed by Anne Linn. I had no sooner reached the gate, than I was assailed by a party of boys who were lounging around it. When you approached, I was satisfied by their language, that the noise of your disgrace had taken wings, and that already you were banned. But I dis- covered among them, in him who was most abusive, the impostor Mayberry, and my heart laughed with anticipated vengeance. Yes, Percy, you shall have your full revenge over him. He id in your power, as a snake in the talons of a young eagle. "How can it be, aunt? And how is it that he is so namedf You must be in error," I said.  "No. I am not in error. But you shall know all. Not to6 day, however. You must bear your disgrace for another day. Day after to-morrow I will be here. I will come prepared to show you who you are, and to vindicate you as wortly of the es teem of all connected with this school!" "But aunt, the disgrace of having been in the work-house!" I said. "That can never be wiped out!" Yes it can! Yes it will be! It shall rsedound to youk honour, and to the eternal infamy of others. Will you heed me  Will you bear patiently whatever you may be called upon to ein dure, another day, and wait with full confidence, that all will be brought round happily fr you?" "  I ill trust you fully, Aunt Meg," I answered with grateful emotion, buoyed up by her *ords.  "That is well said. Now I am going to leave you! I have a person to see, whom I must travel all night to reach. But I will be with you the day after to-morrow, by nine o'clock. I shall go boldly to the academy and ask for Dr. Brodhead, and send for you.. Trust me, and be firm in hope of my coming, and of my being able to do all I have pledged. Good-bye.!" With these words she left me abruptly, and I soon lost sigh.     194  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.- of her tall form, moving through the twilight gloom of the trees, in the direction of the gate. For a few minutes I remained seated as she had left me, re- flecting upon the interview she had had with me. I could not comprehend all that she had said, but I had understood enough to be certain that she would be able to bring light out of the darkness that surrounded me. I marvelled at the discovery of the identity of May's name with my true name, and wondered I had not known it before, or suspected it from the resemblance. I then thought of Anne, and acquitted her in my heart of hearts of any wrong intentionally towards me; and as she had brought upon me unwittingly what I was now suffering, I resolved I would bear it for her sake until my Aunt Meg's return. That May should be- her cousin annoyed me not a little! I could not bear that one whom I so thoroughly detested, and who was so bitterly my eneniy, should stand in such a near and endearing relation to one whom I almost worshipped. But I was consoled in this, by recollecting my aunt's words, " that May was an, im- postor, and wore falsely the name and relationship he bore." It was dark before I rose to retrace my way to the academy. Lights were in scores of windows as I drew near, showing me that the boys were all at their night-tasks; for we had to study till nine o'clock. My room, to my surprise had a light in it, but while I was wondering at it, for I roomed alone, I saw a shadow cross the window and the light disappear. It did not, however, cause me any thought, for I was too much 'occupied with my- self to regard particularly external circumstances. I had ab- sented myself from prayers, and I knew that the boys would miss me, and refer it to my sense of shame at having been de- / tected in playing a false part. With a feeling of calm resolu- lution to bear up and on through all, trusting. in Aunt Meg's promise, who seemed to me to be endowed with something like supernatural powers, I entered the hall door and passed along to my room. At that hour I knew I should meet none of the boys, as all were at study. At the head of the stairs, however, I saw   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 195 Tarper coming down and behind him May, and, to, my surprise, Pringle in company with him. The latter concealed something on seeing me, and Tarper looked at me with a sneer. May, however, smiled peculiarly, and bowing with mock respect, asked me "the price of oakum? .and how my grandmother the witch of Endor did,?" I made no reply, for I had promised Aunt AMeg I would bear everything like a martyr. I passed on, for they gave me a wide berth, particularly Pringle, who had probably made friends again with May, on the ground of fresh and mutual hostility towards me, their common enemy. Upon reaching my room, I closed the door and locked it. How I passed that dreadful night, I can scarcely remember-but I know I did not undress or sleep. When the chapel-bell rung for prayers, I washed and put myself in neat appearance, but I was deadly pale, as my looking-glass betrayed to me. I entered the chapel last of all, and went to my seat. Whoever looked at my face (and it seemed to me that the eyes of every boy of the one hundred and forty in the room were upon it as I came in) would have' remarked only an expression of deliberate and calm self-com- mand. It was rather the immoveability of a statue of marble than the warm life-breathing face of fresh and blood. There seemed to be a deeper silence than usual. I did not look round, nor did I look down-I sought no eye nor shrunk from none. I was glad when the prayers were over, and Tarper's sniffling Amen was the signal for a general dispersion to the play-ground, for the hour intervening till breakfast. I went out last. Every boy, as my seat was near the door, had to pass me, and I knew by every one's manner that my story was known. Some smiled impertinently, some sneered visibly, some whistled, some whew- ed in derision; some laughed scornfully, some looked at me with curiosity, and some few with pity and interest. I bore all these without changing the expression of my face. One boy only stopped, and had'the courage to speak to me; and it was, as the 16*     196  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. reader has already guessed, Edward Fields. He took my hand, and said softly,     -.1 "Come up to my room with me, Berry!" The words were few, but the tones in which they were uttered went directly to my heart. What the derision and contempt and hatred could not do, the words of sympathy effected I I sat down, for I had been standing all the while the boys were passing out, I sat down, laid my face upon my desk, and burst into a flood of tears. He stood by me and tried to soothe me, saying," He did not believe it, if the other boys did!" These words were harder to bear than all, for what was said of me was really true. I thought within my heart, He, noble as he is now, he will shun me when he learns that it is true." I rose and went with him, but led him to my own room. When I had shut the door, I said to him, "Edward Fields, you will never be forgotten by me for daring to stand by an outlaw as I amm in this school to-day. But you do it because you do not believe the story of my having been in the work-house!" "Not a word of it! It is the malicious invention of May." - It is not," I answered, "in this you do him injustice. The storyis true!"I added, firmly, though to confess this to the dearest friend, my only remaining friend in the world, was like the bitterness of death to me. I felt as if each word would have suffocated me. "True, Berry?" he repeated, with a look of incredulity. "You are jesting!" "I do not jest. I wish not to deceive you, Fields. I was in the work-house before I came here!" This was said with such solemn earnestness that he could not doubt me. He stood for a moment looking in my face, which did not move a muscle from its stone-like rigidity. I waited passively for him to fling the jeer of scorn in my face, and leave me also!   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 197 But I mistook this noble being! As he gazed upon me, tears filled his eyes, and his handsome lip trembled, and he reached his hands and took mine, and said, "It may or may not be so, Berry! Perhaps it is so, and if it is, I pity you from the bottom of my heart, for I know how keenly you must feel it now! Whatever circumstances placed. you there, it was not your fault, certainly. I can love you no less' for this; though you surprise me; and I wish it had been otherwise, for May and his party will have the victory, and never be done crowing. But there is one thing that troubles me, for I have believed you so honourable. How is it that you have suffered yourself to pass for a rich young West Indian? Explain this to me satisfactorily, and I shall be a warmer friend to you than ever, for you will now more need my friendship!" "Sit down a few moments," said I, " and I will give you a full history of the whole. It is due to your confidence in me." lie sat down, and I then began and related to him all I knew of my past life, touching upon every subject I have herewith given my readers, not omitting Anne, and the manner of my first introduction to Aunt Meg. I explained to him howshe had seemed to recognise in me some child she ought to have known, and how, from that moment, she lavished upon me her kindness, and her gold, and brought me hither, I spoke to him of Mr. Jenks, and his labours in my behalf. I then showed him in what manner Dr. Brodhead had come to set me down F(rom the Island of Cuba," aIid that, as for the sugar planter -the great wealth, and other stories of that nature, I was wholly unanswerable for them. I also made- known to him my true name, and also the hints thrown out by my aunt touching May. Edward listened to the whole narrative with the deepest atten- tion, manifesting-at different portions of it the liveliest interest. When I had ended, he rose and fairly hugged me in his arms, and to our surprise, we both at the same moment found ourselves folded in the embrace of a third person. On looking up, we found that it was Mr. Jenks. it, t  X      198  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. "I have heard your whole tale, Berry, every word of it," he said, hugging me and Fields both in his long, bony arms, " and I love you' better than ever; and, Fields, you are a noble fellow! I came up to see you and talk with you, Berry, about the reports, right after prayers, but found you so busy unfolding your life to Fields, and he so intent on hearing it, that you neither of you heard me open the door. So I stood and listened, taking a friend's liberty. You have honourably acquitted yourself, and you have Fields and me for your friends through all. Dr. Brod- head shall know all." Thus speaking, he released us, and shaking me warmly by the hands, he sat down by me, and I answered some questions he put to me upon some points which he had not clearly compre- hended. ' Well, Berry," he said, gazing upon me with a sort of wondering look, "yours is a very extraordinary story; and the last chapter is to come yet, it seems; for your Aunt Meg has left you all over mystery still! And so your name is Percival Mayberry, too'! It is odd enough. And you two look so much alike too! How very extraordinary! To-morrow, you say, she promised to be here!"  "Yes, at nine o' clock," I answered, feeling quite like a differ- ent person, now that I had made my two best friends partici- pators in the knowledge of my history, and felt that I had all their sympathy, and had rather riveted than forfeited their esteem. By the time I had ended my story, it was nine o'clock, and I had been three hours talking, neither of us regarding or hearing the breakfast-bell, which had rung at seven. The kind-hearted usher now left me to attend to his duties in the study-hall. Fields, also, was called to his recitations, and I resolved to attend my own as heretofore; .for, strong in the friendship of these two, I felt I could bear up against the united hostility of the whole school. Both Mr. Jenks and Fields would have deterred me from showing myself, until when, the next day, Aunt Meg's 1.I1 ps;.:srlt mo b1fir Dcter BI'cdheradl in my true   "FE AND ADVENTURES OR rrIRC'VAL MAYBERRY. 199 light. But, with a strong confidence that I should yet have the victory (though I hardly could guess how) on my side, I resolved to bear every taunt; and in this temper I descended to the study-hall. I was an object of marked curiosity by nearly every boy. No one spoke to me except Fields, who, for my sake, incurred the sneers of his own friends. Doctor Brodhead was cold and curt, and never spoke to me but with a frown S Tarper would some- times look at me, and try and catch my eye, when he would smile like a devil at me. May took pains to amuse himself, and as many others as were near him, at, my expense. Pringle made on his slate a drawing of the poor-house, and held it up to my eyes, and for fifty others to see, which caused a general titter. In the geography lesson, Doctor Brodhead took particular pains to ask me in what latitude and longitude the Island of Cuba was, and if it were not inhabited by sugar and coffee planters. Tar- per, to whom I reciteR a lesson in grammar, asked me to parse work-house and whether it were a compound noun; and May being asked in his lesson in geography what was the staple of the State of Massachusetts, replied, " oakum!" Such was the nature of the annoyances to which I was exposed through the malice of my schoolmates, and the wounded pride of my teachers; for all felt that my presence there was a dis- grace. My handsome clothes seemed to impress no respect, for the story was, said Fields, that I had a mother who (I can scarcely write the lie) was a beggar and thief, who, after I left the work-house, had stolen the money with which she had bought my fine clothes, and passed me off for a West Indian, and paid for my schooling. With the knowledge that such was the opi- nion entertained of me, I had to bear all these insults without a word or change of countenance. But the crowning degradation was yet to come.    : When recess arrived, instead of going up to my room, as I was prompted to do, in order to relieve my feelings by tears for a ittle while, I went with the rest to the play-ground, reolved not     200  LIFE AND ADVENTURES 0or PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. to shun any of the boys, or seem to act as if I considered myself guilty. Upon reaching the play-ground I was greeted by a universal hurrah," and looking in the direction in which all eyes were turned, I saw, seated upon a platform, in the centre, a figure of a boy picking oakum. At first I thought it was real, but a second look showed me that it was my old suit of work-house clothes, which I had never a good opportunity of destroying, and at length forgot, stuffed with saw-dust and surmounted by a masked face and a paper cap. At its feet was a huge pile of oakum, some of which was held on its lap. Over its head, on a placard, were these words, which seemed to burn into my brain, as if they had been letters of fire:  "OAKUM FOR SALE OR EXCHANGED FOR AN ESTATE IN THE ISLAND OF CUBA." Apply to Room Number L9. Every eye was upon my face, to see the effect this would pro- duce upon me. I felt as if it was turned into steel, I forced it to be so rigid. My pride hardened every muscle like adamant. I read it carefully over, till I had engraved every word upon my heart, and I then turned away. I was afraid my heart would burst; but the hope of the morrow, the recollection of the sweet face of Anne Linn, strengthened me to endure all this. I noticed that no one let himself stand near me. While I was thus insulted and despised, I was treated like a chained lion, that might break its bonds and do mnschief. I saw May, and Pringle, sud Tarper, all enjoying the scene in the play-ground, but they wex evidently annoyed at the little impression it seemed to makA upon me. I knew well whose work it was, and was half-tempted t approach May and charge him with it, and challenge him to dca ud him- self; but I knew he could with justice refuse the combla telling me, that "he, as a gentleman, could not fight with a paver." I did not leave the play-ground until study was rewaned. Upon my desk I found a note, which was signed by seven oA the kead boys, and May's name in full, as Percival Mayberry, fiteed frset.   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 201 It read as follows :. "To PERCY BERRY. The young gentlemen of Parnassus Academy have autho- rized us their committee to signify to you their intention of lynch- ing you, if you do not leave the school you have disgraced within twenty-four hours. Verbum Saat." I read this missive twice over, and gratified the eyes of those who were watching me by smiling contemptuously; and I then carefully copied the seven names in my green note-book, folded up the paper, and placed it in my pocket. But I will not weary the reader with the details of that day of trial, and of martyrdom. The day at length ended, and I once more found, myself in my room, and my two friends with me. From Fields I learned that Tarper had told May, that the poor-house dress was in my trunk, and they had entered my room in fy absence, and taken'it, and it was doubtless the object which Pringle tried to conceal from me on the stairs. How Tarper knew it was in my possession can only be guessed at from a knowledge of his character; for he had been known more than once to go to the boy's trunks, and money had been missed after such detested visitations. It is 'probable, therefore, that in a. foraging expeditionon my premises, he discovered the pauper-suit. "Their possession by you, Berry," said Fields, "is a clear proof to all of the truth of the report about you; and so the more spirited and proud among them are resolved that you shall quit. They have little hope that Dr. Brodhead will send you off, giving you back the two hundred dollars you have paid for the last half year; and so they mean to take the matter in their own hands." Jenks was indignant when I showed him the paper left on my desk. "This will be a warm place for you, Berry, with all your in- noeene and your firmness, which I have never seen equalled, if that good dame, your Aunt Meg, don't ).o ej o your aid, as t            ,      .A.'      202 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. she promised. I fear all that Fields or I could say or do, would not help you." "I have full faith in Aunt Meg's word, and in her power to perform all she has promised," I answered. "But should any- thing prevent her coming, and as my whole dependence ison her, I shall leave the school at once. They will say I am driven off. I care not! I shall be without pride or ambition, then, and it will be indifferent whither I go, or what fate befalls me!" The next morning I awoke early, after a sound sleep. I felt refreshed and buoyant, and full of confidence that my aunt would arrive and do all that she had pledged herself to do in my be- half. I went down to breakfast with a lighter heart. No one spoke to me, and I noticed that the boys were silent, as if in expectation of some unusual occurrence. -At the close of the meal, Doctor Brodhead, who had not deigned yet to speak to me touching the reports that I knew he was cognisant of, rose at the head of the, long table, and rapping smartly, called for silence. He then addressed the pupils as follows: ' Young gentlemen,. "I wish you all to attend at half-past eight o'clock, in the study-hall, half an hour before the usual hour of recitation, in order to discharge some business connected with the welfare and good name of this academy. It is my desire that'you will every one be present." Having -ended these words, he said grace, and dismissed the table. I heard fifty voices say, as the boys retired, "It is to expel Berry, i ' I must confess that my heart beat quicker at this announce-.. ment, for I felt a secret consciousness 'that my' case was the cause for this early assembling in the study-hall. I set my upper lip, and nerved my soul to it! I had hardly got to my room, for I resolved not to go down into the play-ground to expose myself to insults I could not resent, when Terry, the Irish footman, made his appearance. Terry bowed and looked respectful, and I knew he had not caught the infection.   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 203 "The top o' the marnin' to yer honour, IMasther Birry," he said, coming in and closing the door softly. "Ye'll excuse me for throublin' yees, but the ould doethor' sint m'e up to give yees. this bit af a letther, and ses it nades no answer at all." With this, he handed me a note stamped with the huge red seal of Parnassus Academy, a sign that it was of an offioial character. I read as follows:- "To Master PERCY BERRY. i Sir: You are hereby ordered to repair, at half-past eight o'clock, to the study-hall.. Fail not, at the- peril of dis- graceful expulsion. PATRICK BRODHEAD, Head Master of Parnassus Classical Academy." I felt that the crisis was approaching.. Half-past eight would leate but half an hour, at which time Aunt Meg promised to be with Dr. Brodhead in his study. "It's some throubles yees ha' got' into, Masther Birry," said Terry, in a half-confidential way. "-Och 1 I have heern all aboot the mather. Don't ye throuble yer young heart 'at al, at all-! What an' if yees have been in the .poor-hoos; isn't'it' the more for yer credit and honour intirely, that he have coom to be sich a fine jintleman from sich a sorry raisin.' Bother my sowl, honey! I'd stand up wid the best o' the krathurs. Amerikees' a free counthry, and divil a wone on us but might ha' been in the work-hoos in the ould counthry, if we'weren't in this.

I hearn him say he'd send for d Misther Shirkey to come and take ye aff, if ye was made oot to have been wone o' the pauper byes." I could bear no mor'! It seemed as if not' another drop could be poured into my cup: Terry saw. the tears in my eye, and'swore if they harmed me, he'd handle the shillelah for me till the byes' pates cracked. Mr. Jenks at this moment came in 17     :'204 tLFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. and remained with me until half-past eight was announced by the tolling of the bell. I felt as if I were going to execution.. Within the next hour I was to be 'acquitted with honour, or rendered infamous. I was proud, high-spirited, honourable in feeling, and peculiarly sensitive upon my honour and integrity. All that I held sacred was endangered, and I felt myself in dan- ger of being branded as an impostor and a liar. But I tried to fortify my firmness by hope in Aunt Meg, by thinking of Anne, and in the consciousness of my own innocence. As Mr. Jenks went with me towards the study-hall, Edward met me and whispered to me that he had the day before sent a note to his mother, who lived but eight miles distant, informing her of the dangers menacing me, that she had arrived two hours' before, and that he had been telling her my whole story. "And I have something more to tell you," he added. "You will see, besides my mother, who is your true friend, in the hall, 'Mrs. Caroline Linn, and her fair daughter Anne." "To witness my disgrace," I groaned. "No, to witness your triumph, be persuaded; for I have as much faith in Aunt Meg as you have; and my mother says, she feels confident, from what Aunt Meg once told her about you, that you will come out of this trial with honour, and with con- fusion to May and his party, who are so anxious to destroy you!"  These words encouraged me, and I entered the hall composed, and was going to take my usual seat, when Dr. Brodhead called aloud, Master Percy Berry will come forward, and take a seat on this stool!" I obeyed, and passing down the aisles of boys, who were all in their seats, I mounted a low platform, on which was placed at his left, facing the pupils, a three-legged stool.. HereI took my seat. ,  !o        .,   ,             . tIT1FF: ANT) I y T RIR op PTtCW AT, MAYBIERRY. 92O CIAPTER X. UPON being seated, I calmly, for my face was as calm as that of the dead, and I felt nearly dead, I calmly looked around me, upon the scene into which I had been brought. There was a slight alteration made about the doctor's desk. Chairs were placed there, which were unusual, and a table had been added, and some letters or notes and papers, and a bundle, lay upon it. Dr Brodhead was dressed in the black silk robe he was accistomed to wear only on Sundays. On each side of him, sat the two ushers, one looking like night, the other like morning, so opposite were the expressions of their faces. The whole school was quiet and expectant, scarcely a boy moving,-but seated with every eye fixed upon me. I felt myself as a criminal arraigned among them, but I resolved to be firm, trusting in my'innocence of all "intentional wrong, and in the. mysterious aid which my Aunt Meg promised to bring me. I looked at the clock over Dr. Brod. head's desk, and found that the hands indicated twenty-five niinutes to nine. The doctor looked at his large silver watch at the same moment, and putting it back into his fob with great solemnity and dignity, rapped upon his'desk for silence, though deeper silence than prevailed could scarcely be obtained. Ioe then rose, and made the following speech:  "Ushers, and young gentlemen, of this respectable Academy," here he paused, took a monstrous pinch of snuff from his waist- coat flap-pocket, and was about to apply it to his nose, when the side door leading to the parlour was opened by Terry, and Mrs. Fields was ushered in, accompanied by Mrs. Caroline Linn, ind Anne. 'I had been prepared by Edward for their presence, but on seeing them, my blood rushed to my face, and I held my face   X         -     .     206  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. down, as if I would hide my face from the eyes of those I es- teemed and regarded above all others.  "Hold up your head, sir," said Tarper, who sat near me. "You must look the whole school in the face." At this I threw up my head haughtily enough, and fixed upon him a look of deliberate defiance, beneath which his meanly suspicious glance cowered and turned away. This incident did me more good at that moment, than an hour's kind words would have done; and I looked about me self-possessed and resolute, yet without unbecoming hardihood. The ladies were received by Dr. Brodhead with great polite- ness, and conducted to the seats Mr. Jenks had had placed there for them, at Edward's request. "I fellsuch an interest in young Master Berry, doctor," said Mrs. Fields, so as to be heard by all, ' that I no sooner learned the difficulties into which he has fallen, than I hastened to be present at the inquiry you are about to make into his conduct; and I took the liberty of inviting my friend, Mrs. Caroline Linn, to accompany me, especially as she has a nephew here." "You are very welcome, ladies," said the doctor, with suavity. "You do us honour. ---Our academy is at all hours and all times open to the visits of its distinguished patrons! Ladies, with your permission, I will now go on with a brief address I was about making, when you honouredlus with your fair presence." The doctor then took a second pinch of snuff, and once more rapping for silence, began as before, and thus continued "You are aware that it has been my effort to make Parnassus Academy the aristocratic school of the land! To this end I have not only been particular as to the character of the boys and the standing of their families, but I have guarded against vulgar persons intruding themselves here, by fixing the price of tuition larger than is charged by any other place of education. By means of these precautions I trust that I have succeeded in making this academy every way so unexceptionable and, select, that the most fastidious parent need not 'hesitate to place his or her, son here, , ,   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 20' though he were heir to millions, and inheritor of a dukedom The distinguished and exclusive patronage I have receive( hitherto, has not only recognised pmy care in this respect, bu exhibited marked and unequivocal approbation of my course But-but.---" and here he paused, and looked steadfastly a me! There was a deep pause of expectation. Every eye fol lowed his. At the same moment I caught the encouraging glance of Mrs Fields, and a -tearful look-from Anne's eyes, that made my hear light, and cleared my brow, and made me meet the stern gaz of the doctor with respectful steadiness, without fear or shame "But, I regret to say, that in one instance-one remarkabl instance, we have. signally failed in our aim, and been defeate( in our purpose, and that this day, there is a blot, yes, a darl blot, yes, a most disgraceful blot on the escutcheon of Parnassu Classical Academy "  Here he was interrupted 'by 'a half-suppressed murmur of approbation. He struck the table to restore attention, and thus proceeded; but, in the interval, my eyes 'had sought Anne's and drank in from them a cup running over of strength to endure How she could thus sympathize' with me, when she well knew  had been a pauper, I knew not.' But I did not then know that my whole history, so far as he knew it, had been made know i to her and her mother by Edward that morning, and that she blamed me in no one thing, and-expressed to him the warmes interest in my honourable acquittal. This, and more, I learned afterwards. - I had the sustaining eye, also, of her mother, and of my other friends, and I felt power to bear all things that I was doomed to suffer. "I need not," resumed Dr. Brodhead, "I need not take ut your time by entering into particulars. You all know to what and to whom I allude. Stand up, Percy Berry!' I rose to my feet and faced him.    . "You are accused before your peers and teachers in this school of fraud, of duplicity, of falsehood, and imposture. When you -17* -     208 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. came here, you told me you were from the West Indies, a native of the Spanish Island of Cuba, which I have here recorded against your name as taken down from your lips," and here he emphati- cally placed his finger upon the page of the record which lay open before him. "You represented yourself as the inheritor of great wealth, and as well-born. Now, it is charged upon you that, instead of being well-born, you know not who your parents are; that instead of having riches you are a pauper; and instead of having come hither from the Island of Cuba, you came hither from the county work-house, from which you eloped; and you are charged with being provided with clothing and money to, come here by a female, who is said to be a notorious thief, and who, doubtlesss, planned with you, her well-matched son, this conspiracy, to bring disgrace upon Parnassus Classical Academy." Here was heard a hiss, which I knew came from the lips of May, and there were several voices that broke out aloud in con- demnation of me. I remained unmoved, all the while steadily gazing into the face of Dr. Brodhead. "Oh, if Aunt Meg should fail me!' was the thought that shot across my sinking. soul for an instant. But I .felt that Anne's and other kind eyes were upon me, and I gathered renewed strength. "Now, young sir," resumed the doctor, "we are as just as we are powerful and respectable, and be it far from us to judge a worm without giving it an opportunity to defend itself. You are now at liberty to speak in, your own defence, and show cause, if any there be, why sentence of expulsion, with every disgraceful adjunct which can be appended thereto by me or your fellow-pupils, shall not be passed upon you, and that clothed in your Poor-House garments, which lie here before me (and here he unrolled the bundle I had seen, and held up at his  fingers' ends my former coarse habiliments, at the sight of which there was a general outhreak of coarse laughter from the whole schooD, you be ignominiously conducted out of the grounds to the highway!

"FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 209   u can make, these clothes which were found in your room bear testimony against you; and I have, sent for Mr. Shirkey, to see if ho recognises you; so that you will take heed how you deny these charges, lest you be involved deeper in shame and falsehood. It is with pain and sorrow I am compelled," added the doctor, looking at the ladies, "to bring these accusations against this pupil, for he has been an upright scholar in all things else, and by his diligence and perseverance has ranked already among the first in his classes. But good scholarship can never cover deception and imposture! BSpeak, Percy Berry, if you have one word to say in your defence." The doctor then sat down, wiping his forehead with his large red handkerchief, and taking afterwards a huge pinch of snuff. I stood alone in the midst. The mention of Shirkey's name made me tremble, and I felt the blood tingle cold and chill to the very soles of my feet. I had an habitual dread of the man; and at any time the sight of my childhood's tyrant would have moved me not a little. ,But to have him brought before me now, and with power to recover me again, was enough to un- nerve me. If I had intended to make any denial of the charge, I could not now have dose it with any face; but I had no in- tention of denying. Indeed I had not decided what course to take. My mind, constantly dwelling upon my aunt's pledge, was buoyed up with full confidence in her ability to perform all she had promised. I waited for her. I looked at the clock. It was ten minutes yet to nine'o'clock. While all were waiting for me to speak, and while Dr. Brodhead looked sternly at me, as if he expected me to open my mouth with a falsehood, I said, faintly, "I ask ten minutes! If by that time I cannot make a de- fence, I will submit without a word to the sentence that may be passed upon me; but IFwill solemnly now say, that whatever seems evil in this thing, and however circumstances may go against me, I am innocent of any intentional wrong-doing; and that the reflection upon the kind woman by whose manifienpe                    i.     210 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL, MAYBERRY. I have been placed here is. undeserved, as she is honest, and wor- thy, and deserves my gratitude and esteem! We cannot give you the time you ask," said Dr. Brodhead. "Say what you have, to say now,'as at nine we must resume studies." "I will then speak in my defence," I answered, emboldened by a glance from Mr. Jenks's eyes. But before I could say more, there was a knock at the door, and Terry ushered in Shir- key and his wife. The sight of them made my heart jump into my throat, and I thought I should have fallen; but I heard Anne whisper across to me, "Don't mind them, Percy." These words acted like a charm upon me. I stood firm as a rock, and met their gaze full and self-possessed, as they both stopped just within the door and gazed at. me. '".You will look round the school, Mr. Shirkey," said Dr. Brodhead, "and see if you find any of your pauper boys here. I pray from my heart you may be able to say you cannot." "'Here is one, I guess," responded the mian, after 'staring all around the room, boldly advancing and laying his hand with a gripe upon May's shoulder. "IwoiAl know him in a thousand, for all his black clothes." May sprung to his feet and uttered a cry of fierce indignation and shame, and, amid a shout of laughter from his enemies, struck him a blow full in the breast with a small knife, with which he was, at the moment, paring his finger nails. No one. saw the knife in his hand, and supposed it only a simple blow, nor did Shirkey know that he was stabbed, until, as he struggled  'to secure May, the blood dyed his shirt bosom. Mrs. Shirkey, in the meanwhile, had run to his aid in securing May, and on seeing the blood, she shrieked, and called out that he was, murdered. May was, rescued by some of his friends, and drew Off, while Shirkey, looking at the wound, which was just under the collar bone, said, "Ii is but a scratch, and will soon be hailed," and he pressed uion it a bit of oakum which he had   "Fr AND ADVENTUM N OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 2" in his pocket, and laid his handkerchief'several times folded upon it, and buttoned up his coat. He was too much of a ruffian, and, doubtless, too familiar with blood, to be much concerned at this seemingly slight cut with a penknife. He now would have made a second rush at May, but for Dr. Brodhead's voice. "'Mr. Shirkey, you have made a mistake," he said; "Order and quiet!" he then called out, fort the scene I have just described had created for a moment terrible confusion throughout the room. "Is not his name Percival Mayberry?" demanded Shirkey, who felt little respect for the dignity of the head master, where the recapture of a runaway orphan Was in question. "That is his name," was Dr. Brodhead's reply, with a look of surprise. "Then he is the chap. There is no mistaking him.. My wife and I both know him. With your leave, I will take him back." "He is a liar, Dr. Brodhead. You know, sir, it is a lie," cried May, almost black with indignation. "You are bribed, fellow, to do this. There is your boy ;" and thus speaking, he extended his pointed finger to the spot where I stood, scarcely able to comprehend what I saw going bn before my eyes. His voice, however, recalled me to my duty. "He is right.!"I exclaimed in a loud voice. "I am the per- son for whom Shirkey has taken' him. I have been in the work- house, and I will not deny it!"          '  At this speech, which rang like a clarion through the hall. Shirkey's'wife fixed her eyes upon me, and cried, "e is right, Skinner, there is two alike.! But this-is the right one, for I know him by his, voice!" The whole room was in an uproar, some crying out that May was the true one (these were those who hated him for his over- bearing temper), and others calling on him to seize me. Sud- denly, in the midst of this excitement, in the door in the rear.     212  LIFE AND. ADVENTURES OF PF CJVTAL MAYBERRY. the door by which the scholars usually entered the hall, I de. tected the tall figure of Aunt Meg towering high., 1 clapped my hands and uttered a, cry of joy, and, catching Mr. Jenkl's eye, I shouted, "There she is-! She is come! She is come!" My attitude, with my hand pointed at her, drew first ohe eye, and then another, till every one saw her. She looked like an enraged goddess, a sort of wrathful Juno. She was dressed in a gray gown and red shawl, and carried her bonnet in her hand, so that her gray locks were conspicuous, standing up about her head like a hoary. crest. Her very height gave her dignity, and the masculine outline of her face, with its stern expression, lent ) to her the idea of power. She paused an instant on the threshold, and seemed to be looking for me; for when she beheld me, she exclaimed, "He is here!" and marched straight down the alley between the benches. The boys shrunk from her on either hand as she passed, and silence followed her, until she stood in the open space in front of the platform where Dr. Brodhead sat. He had never seen her before, and regarded her with looks of sur- prise and alarmed curiosity. Shirkey and his wife, who were advancing towards me, stepped back and looked upon her with apprehension. She came towards me, and said in an under tone, Fear not! I have it in my power to free thee from thy enemies. I have learned from the kind Irishman in the front room what they have been doing with thee here!" "Who art thou, woman? and what doest thou here?" de- manded Dr. Brodhead, in the midst of the most perfect silence a silence that was deepened by a strange awe which the pre- sence and formidable appearance. of my aunt produced. "Doctor Brodhead," said' Aunt Meg, raising herself to her full stature, and sending a glance about as if she feared no man, "my name is Margaret Joscelyn. I am here to speak iia de- fence of this brave boy, whom you maliciously persecute this day, and whom I will prove innocent of all wrong towards you!' "I do not know you," said Doctor Brodhead, "but if you can   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY.   v[3 clear him, no one here will be more gratified thlan I shall be, for I bear no malice against him, but, rather he has been a favour- ite of mine in the school. But I must know if you are to be trusted-?" Aunt Meg cast her eyes on Mrs. 'Caroline Linn, and said, "Here is a lady who will tell you that you may believe what I am about to say"  "I have full confidence in her, Dr. Brodhead," said the lady; "I know that what she will state is true." "You hear, sir," said Aunt Meg; " but there are two pa- pers. Read them, and then hear what I have to say." As she spoke, she placed in Dr. Brodhead's hands two papers.

"Then he has been in the work-house?" remarked the doc- tor, elevating his eyebrows. "Yes," answered Aunt Meg, firmly, "and if you and all pre- sent will give me your ears, I will show you that he has suffered this degradation from no fault of his own, but from the sins of others, and you will find him more deserving your sympathy and respect than your censure and contempt., What I am about to state can be proven and will be proven by papers in the hands of lawyers and the court. Now listen to what I have to say. "The father of this boy was the celebrated Admiral. Castel- lan, Prince of Medina, a Spanish nobleman of high rank and distinguished fame, as you 'all have heard. The Admiral was one of twins. His twin brother, instead of walking in the path of honour and glory, herded with bandits, and became the ter- ror of his countrymen. In the course of events, Admiral Cas- Atellan became Governor-General of Cuba, where he resided in all the magnificence of a king surrounded by his court. But before he left Spain, he married a lovely woman, the daughter of the Marquis of Cadiz, whose sister, after the Admiral's de- parture, was carried off by the bandit twin brother into the mountains, and forcibly espoused by him. This outrage," con- tinued my aunt, who saw that she had gained the fixed atten- tion of all in the hall, and of none more than myself, to whom these things were as new as they were surprising, "this gross outrage led to a general arming among the followers of the Marquis, who, aided byithe King's troops, led so large a force against Don Carlos, (this was the name of the bandit chief,) that he was beaten, his people dispersed or slain, and he him- self, with his stolen wife, escaped with difficulty to the sea-side. Here they took an English ship, and were carried to London, where, for disguise, he took the name of the captain of the ship,   "FE 'AN'DADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 215 which was AMayberry. Poverty, however, overtook him, and he resolved that he would go to Cuba, and, under pretence of deep penitence, throw himself upon his brother's generosity; for he well knew his noble nature, and that he was readier to forgive than to, punish. In order to obtain means to leave England and reach Cuba, he robbed a gentleman upon the highway. I was at that time a poor soldier's widow and seeking for place. He hired me at wages to attend on his wife and infant son, and to cross the sea with them. Tempted by his offers, and inte- rested in the beauty of the lady, and urged by her to consent, I yielded, muci as I would have preferred remaining in England. On the voyage I learned from her own lips all the facts which I have related; and which were afterwards corroborated from other sources. She did not love, but rather feared her husband, who played the tyrant over her. She said she was only reconciled to visit Cuba, by the hope of once more embracing her sister, the Count- ess of Castellan, wife of the Admiral. You may be assured," continued my aunt, "that my feelings were all interested in the dear lady who had thus been stolen from her father's house, and dragged over the world, by such a wicked outlaw as she had been compelled to marry. "At length we reached the Island of Cuba, and, under the name still of Mayberry, we took a retired house, just outside the walls of Havana, near the Paseo, and full in sight of it. Don Carlos now disguised himself as much :as he could, in order not to be recognised by anybody, for as Cuba belongs to Spain, constant intercourse is kept up between the two countries, of which-he was well aware. At a little before sunset, the citizens all ride out in carriages on the Paseo, which is a public park. We could see them from a little window of our house. Here, the second evening, Donna Isabel, my mistress, stationed herself, and soon recognised her sister rolling by in the splendid coach of 'the Governor-General. He rode after it, dressed in magnificent uni- form, attended by his aids and a half a score of gentlemen, a  18     216  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PFRCIVAL MAIYBERRY. column of cavalry following in his rear. It was a superb sight. Donna Isabel sighed, as she contrasted her own degradation, both as poor, and as an outlaw's wife, with that of her sister.  "In a littre while Don Carlos came in. He looked gloomy, and told her- he had seen his brother, but had not spoken to him. But he said he would drink a cup or two of wine, and go off and have an interview with him in his palace; for he was now wholly without money. - "About midnight he came in. We were sitting up for him; and while we waited together, I tried to prevail on her to' fly to the palace, and cast herself on .her sister the Countess's protec- tion. This she refused, and said she would like to have me take a note to her the next day. This I had promised to do, as her husband came in. He looked blacker and more wicked than I had ever seen him look before. . He said he had been refused admittance to the palace, but confessed he had not made known tothe guards who he was. II will approach my brother to-morrow in his hall of audience,' he said, 'and see what will be the issue!' "The next day at noon he went out, and returned at three in a happier mood. He reported that he had seen his brother, who had recognised him, and had welcomed him with deep affection, embracing him when he had withdrawn him by himself. He then promised him his aid, placed in his hands a purse of gold, and showed him his little son, who was in 'the arms of its nurse. ' I never saw such a resemblance between two children, as between ours and my brother's,' said Don Carlos. 'One would swear they were twins. But I observed his had a little scar under its left ear. The-Governor asked after you, and said that this evening the Countess, your sister, would call for you, as she is desirous to see you, having got a note from you by some means.' "The same evening the Countess, who was one of the most beautiful creatures the earth ever produced, came to see my mistress. The meeting was full of affection. The Countess said, if she forgave her husband, Don Carlos, the Governor   "FE AND ADVENTURES OR PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 217 would also forgive him, and give him a post in the army. Donna Isabel said she could not but forgive the father of her boy; and when the Countess had seen the child, she could hardly believe that it was not her own son. Don Carlos was present at this interview, and heard the Countess's nurse add, that she could not tell them apart, were it not for the scar on the Govern- or's son beneath the ear. "Now I will come to an important part of my narrative," said Aunt Meg, on whose lips every ear had hung with deep interest, as if they had been listening to a romance, instead of an account of real occurrences in their own day. "The repentance of Don Carlos seemed so sincere, that, gradu- ally, he won more and more upon the unsuspecting confidence of his brother, who at length seemed to forget that he had been a great robber, and was an outlaw from Spain, with a price set upon his head. Donna Isabel passed nearly all her time in the palace with her sister, and I was also always present with her as the nurse to the boy. One night I was awaked by a sharp scream from the child, and turning over to it, for it slept with me in an apartment of the palace adjoining. that occupied by Don Carlos and his wife, I saw its face red with blood. Upon examination, I discovered that it had been cut with a sharp instrument beneath the ear, in a half-circular shape, and precisely in the place, and with' such a wound, as that which marked the Governor's son. I was surprised at this, as no one could enter the chamber but Don Carlos or Donna Isabel, both of whom came running at my outcry, and expressed equal grief and surprise at the event, and full of amazement as to the cause. "The result was, that when the child's neck healed, there was nothing to distinguish him from the son of the Governor, the scars being exactly similar. I could tell them apart only from, the sweeter'smile the Governor's son had; for my boy would frown and scowl at times so like his father, that I almost hated him. At the command of Don Carlos, neither of us spoke of this scar, lest, as he said, wrong motives might be attributed to us.     218  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY "Four years passed away, and I got to loving the Governor's son so much better than mine, that Donna Isabel would speak of it with reproof. But I could not help it. Don Carlos, tired of being honest and upright, at length joined in a conspiracy with certain disaffected persons to separate Cuba from Spain He was, however, detected, and would have been arrested and shot but for the. Countess, who, knowing the determined pur- poe of the Count to make an example of him if he should take him, privately informed him, by going to his rooms in the palace, where she knew him to be concealed, saying, that she wished to save him for her sister's sake, who seemed to have some love for him. She then advised him to quit Cuba, leaving her behind, and never return. He promised he would do so that night; when she gave him money. When night approached, he came to me to kiss the boy and bid farewell; and then he begged me to let him see and kiss his brother's boy also. I went after it, for it lpved me, and I greatly loved it, it was so much more gentle than my own charge, and brought it in. He took them both up in his arms, and was saying how much they were alike, when, at a fancied noise, he started so as to overturn the candle and leave the room in darkness. "' Here, take the boy back,' hecried, thrusting, as I supposed, the Governor's son again into my arms, 'I must escape! They are upon me!'  "The next moment he had disappeared. I called out after him to leave mine also, but all was silent. I hurried, leading the dear little boy by the hand, to return him to his nurse, and then hastened to recover my own charge, which as I have said  I did not love much, he was so bad-tempered; while its cousin won my heart, it was so affectionate. But I could not find either Don Carlos or the boy, nor even his mother. At length,  after about a-quarter of an hour's search, I learned that the o Donna Isabel had been seen leaving the palace alone. I then  suspected she had been persuaded to follow her husband, for he had all day been urging her to it, and had ordered him te, take the boy with him. I knew that a vessel was in port abou:   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 219 to sail, which the Countess had advised him to escape on; and that he had taken passports, under the name of Percival May- berry, for himself Almost distracted with my suspicions, I hastened along the streets to the quay, but so often delayed by the guards, and compelled to answer to my name, that when. I reached the pier, I learned that the last boat had left, and that no one could go off that night to any vessel without permission from the Governor-Genera. 'From my inquiries of a sergeant of the mole-guard, I learned that a gentleman, lady, and a little boy of three or four years of age, had gone off in the last boat; and that the lady seemed to go willingly, but wept a great deal. "I was now in despair," resumed my aunt; " for I was deeply attached to my mistress, and for'her would have given up my life. I also cared for the boy, but not much, compared with my affection for his cousin, whose winning ways, gentle temper, and generous spirit completely stole my heart. His cousin, on the contrary, was spiteful, and hated me as he grew older indeed, gave me no peace. Still, on its mother's account, and from a sense of duty, I 'took kind care of it; but Iidore, the other, had my hhrt. "The same night confirmed the fact of the flight of Don Carlos and his wife, and that he had taken off---ith him the Admiral's boy and left his own. I alone discovered it. I had sought the presence of' the Princess on my return to the palace, to bewail ;o her the flight of my mistress and her boy, wlhen I learned 'rom her that she had taken leaveof her, having consented to part nith her, as she said she would not leave her husband, who had aid, if she stayed, he must take his child. ' But, added the ountess, 'if you wish tofollow her, you shall do so in the next hip to the States; but she told me that as you loved only my hild, you would be happier to remain with me; and so she rould say nothing to you about it. You can, therefore, remain rith me, or go after my sister.' "I told her I would remain with her; and, though grieved at arting with one mistress, I was glad to have her replaoed by 18*   * .  k.   -             '  .    '   * '  ,  ^     220  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. another so good, and the child I hated by one to whom I was so devotedly attached. With these feelings I went to the nur- seay, where I found the African nurse asleep, and the little Prince also buried in slumber. I approached and bent down to kiss it, and upon my disturbing it, it frowned, and, half-opening its eyes, used at me the bitter epithets which Donna Isabel's boy, whose name was Pedro, only could use. I started with sur- prise! I looked again, and my suspicions being awakened, I examined the under part of its right arm, near the shoulder, where, on both the children, I had pricked in, some weeks be- fore, with India ink, the initial letter of its name,?for Pedro on one, and I for Isidore on the other. This I did after the scar had been made, as I had suspected that to be Don Carlos's work, for some sinister purpose of his own; for I knew he was capable of anything; therefore I thus marked them; and," add- ed my aunt firmly, those two marks shall yet be exhibited to you in proof of what I assert this day. "I had no sooner bared the arm than I saw the letter P, as I had apprehended. Instantly I knew that Don Carlos had over- thrown the light to change the children in the dark; under- stood why he had requested me to dress them alike that day, that her might see them once more together 'matched,' as he expressed it; and comprehended his motive in wishing to see them together. My first impulse was to cry out and give the alarm; but I felt that this could now do no good; and that I  might possibly lose my life for the part I had taken in it inno- cently. 'I therefore restrained my feelings, and resolved to wait till the morrow, and see what to-morrow would bring forth. -But all that day the change was not discovered, but both the Admiral and his lady spoke of the impatience of the boy as unusual, and once he told them they were not. his father and mother, and he would have nothing to say to them. But they laughed it off. I trembled all day lest the truth should be dis- covered; and that night I resolved to fly from the palace, and get on board an English vessel that was bound to New York   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 221 the mate of which I had seen walking a few days before near the palace, and whom I recognised as being from the same town in England that I was. I sent for him, and making known my wish to go to the States, and my ability to pay for my passage, he took me secretly on board in male attire. One of my chief objects in leaving the island, was to endeavour to recover the young Prince, and restore him to his mother. I will not," continued my aunt, " weary you with the de- tails of my adventures. With but one thought on my mind, I went from port to port. At length I sailed for this city, hoping that I might learn that it was here Don Garlos and his lady. landed from Cuba. But the vessel on which I sailedfrom New York here had small-pox on board, and was stopped at the qua- rantine. All this time I had worn my sailor's apparel, and served as a seaman, thinking I could easier, in this guise, seek out those I was in search of. The only two beings, my mis- tress and young Isidore, that I loved on earth, drew me conti: nually forward. Nearly all the crew and passengers were taken down with the small-pox, and landed on the island, now called. Pest Island. I was one of those who were sick, but I recovered, the only one of the crew; and the vessel thus deserted, was driven on the island in a storm and wrecked. Thus was I free and alone. I here resumed my female dress, and was employed to nurse the sick, which vessel after vessel landed there from time to time. I took the place of others who died. You may ask why I was content to remain there. Because I had at last learned the fate of Don Carlos. Upon the island, in the office of the Pest House, is a large dooms-day book, in which the island physician records the names of all the patients. One day, as I was'convalescing, I was turning over that book of the dead, and came upon the name Percival Mayberry. I examined the date, and found that the vessel in which he had taken pas- sage had been quarantined at 'that island, and he and others landed sick. Opposite his name was the black D, which told that he had died in thl 'Pest i[outse! The name of Donna Isabel     222  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. wws also there as f Mrs. Mayberry,' but the letter R, signifying recovery, was opposite her name. But in the margin, was a note written after by the doctor, which reads thus: 'This per- son went to the city with her child, a boy of four years, called Percival Mayberry, and supported herself by her needle; but she died last week in poverty.' "In this wonderful way," resumed my aunt, did I come to the knowledge of these facts. But the mystery of the young' Isidore's fate I could not penetrate. From time to time I visited the town, but could gain no intelligence of him, and at length I gave him up. as dead!"  My aunt then directed attention to me as the lost Isidore, and went on to relate in what manner she had encountered me as I lay sleeping on the old fort, and to unfold my history, as is already known to the reader, down to the- present time. She showed how I had been placed in the poor-house by an order given to a stranger whom she did not know, and she was indignantly elo- quent upon the tyrannical conduct of Shirkey and his wife, who shrunk under her-withering lashes. She clearly convinced every one that I was the son of Governor-General Castellan, and that I was, in truth, born in Cuba, as I had unwittingly said. When she had ended,-she strode towards me, and bade me slip my arm from my sleeve. I did so; and, baring my arm above my elbow, she triumphantly raised it, and pointed to the letter I. There was a general murmur of surprise and admiration, min- gled with satisfaction. Dr. Brodhead looked as if he would have risen and shaken me by the hand, and Edward seemed ready to fly into my embrace. But my aunt waved a gesture of silence. I have not yet done. Justice must be done to the evil as well as to the good. When I recovered my lost boy, I did not delay to write to the West Indies to the Marquis of Castellan. But he had returned to Spain, and was living on his estates. Thither my letter followed him, and it was only yesterday I obtained the long-expccted reply. You will see that it bears ,   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL' MAYBERRY. 223 post-marks, and seals, and all authentic signatures. It reads thus, and it is the countess who writes:  CASA DE MEDINA, ( Castile, Spain, March, 1814. "To MARGARET JOSCELYN. ' Your letter has only reached us this week. I am over- whelmed with the news you write, for I supposed you and my dear boy numbered with the dead. I already, long since-the day after you left-learned that Pedro was not my own son. I will not enter into a particular account of the excitement which followed. The Marquis resorted to every means in his power to ascertain whether his brother had fled with our child. We also regarded you as a party to the crime against us; but you have explained all to our satisfaction. At length we received a letter dated at a 'Lazar-House' in some port, without date, from Don Carlos. In it he. said that he was about to die, asked our for- giveness, told us he had taken our boy as aprotection to himself against his brother's anger, and as a means to exact a large sum, of money from him by and by, to give him up; but that death had now arrested'his plans. , He said that Donna Isabel had no idea of the deception, and believed the child her own son, for he had threatened it with death if it betrayed to her that he was not.. He said that he feared to tell her the truth, and wrote the letter that we might seek her out. He then added, that the child left in Havana, though called, jy his mother Pedro, was christened properly 'Percival Mayberry,' which was thO name he himself had borne in England; where it was born. The letter was endorsed by the doctor, 'THE WRITER bF THB WITHN IS DEAD.' "'Upon receiving this letter, every exertion was made tofind the widowed mother and our child, through our consul, but in vain. We then resolved to send from our presence one who so reminded us of him, but could never take his place; and, there being in Havana at this time, froh America, a half-sister of the Marquis,     224  LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. who had some years before married an American gentleman in Cadiz, and was going to the United States to reside, I placed the boy in her charge, making her acquainted with all the circum- stances of his birth and parentage. This lady, who is Mrs. Caroline Maria Linn, took charge of him under the name which his father had given him, Percival Mayberry, and placed him at our expense in a school, of which a Dr. Brodhead is Principal, to be educated; but we have no further interest in him thaln to see that he is educated, when he must trust to his own fortunes. It strikes me that if we had made inquiries after our own son by that name (for doubtless Don Carlos conferred it upon Isidore), 'we might have' gained soine intelligence of him, and I earnestly beg you will inquire for him under this designation." The last portion of this important letter was hardly heard, for, when May heard Dr. Brodhead's school named, he gave utterance to a shrill cry, that seemed to have come from a proud heart rent in twain. He fell on the floor senseless, and was about to be carried out:when he recovered his feet, and, with a face as white is wool, shook his white hands, open, in the face' of Margaret Joscelyn, but in vain tried' to articulate the hot words that rose to his throat. At last, suffocating- with his feelings, he broke into a wild laugh, and tearing his, hair, rushed from the hall! In my heart I sympathized with him. But I was too full of my own joy, to think of diy one but myself and the joy of my friends. Mrs. Linn had instantly corroborated 'the statement in the Countess's, shall I not say my'mother's letter! Dr. Brod- head fairly hugged me! Mr. Jenks'blubbered and washed my face with his overmuch crying; Edward folded me to his'heart;  and Mrs. Linn, calling me her nephew, kissed me and presented me to Anna, as my own cousin. The boys crowded around me and sought to shake hands with me, and, in the happiness of the mo. ment, I forgot that they had, ever been hostile to me. Even Terry stole up and gave me his " two fists," as he said. As for Aunt Meg, she was caressed, and praised, and congratulated on all sides.   "FE AND ADVENTURES OF PERCIVAL MAYBERRY. 225 Dr. Brodhead shook her heartily by the hand, and-offered her snuff and Anne kissed her, and said she should always love her. Under cover-of the scene; Shir1ley and his wife stole out, 'and I, so late a criminal and banned, was the hero of the day. Dr. Brodhead gave full holiday, and, with a heart overflowing with peace and joy, I at length sought my room, to-rejoice with Aunt Meg, Jenks, Fields, and his mother, my real aunt Oaroline Linn, and my own cousin Anne. It-would take another volume to narrate all that followed : how I left school, and went to Spain, and finally married Anne, though not without having escaped assassination on the bridal eve, by Pedro my cousin's dagger, who followed closely in the career of his father before him; to narrate, how I at length discovered Dick, like one raised from the dead, and how he lived with me my faithful coachman, till the dropsy at length took him from the box and the world; and how Aunt Meg dwelt with Anne and  me, an honoured guest, to the latest period of her life, which closed in honour and happiness, as it should have done.
