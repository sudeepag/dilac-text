On the morning of the 17th June, 1776 the h beautiful ship Canso shook out her topsails h to the wind, and the decks were enlivened by the merry voices of-some twenty' men, while i they "sheeted home" and made sail for Old o England. The anchor weighed and catted, c top-gallant-sails and royals, jib and flying- di jib, topsail and foresail, were in quick suc- cessic't displayed, and the Canso stood out a the hr'o-rT of Kingston, Jamaica, with a fait wind, and many good wishes from the group  assembled on the quay to witness her depar-  ture. At a little distance from the principal party: might be seen two individuals, earnest- h ly eaged in conversation. One of them t was a finely formed man, apparently of thirty r years wearing-a closely fitting frock-coat,  white pantaloons, and a blue cloth cap with gold band; his dark hair and' piercing black eyes giving a character of manliness and re-  solve to his whole person. The other wore a  blue dress-coat and pantaloons, and a similar cap, with dark, weather-beaten features and a restless eye, and perhaps some eight or ten years the junior of his comrade. "How many boxes were there, Roberto? sai,' the elder, addressing his companion. "About forty, Captain: the night was so d--d dark I could not see distinctly, but I heard tt r mate say, as his boat passed me for theshore, that they had thirty on board, and he shot. take the balance on his retarn to the shil. "But :he marks, Roberto?  "Aye, ayes sir! let Roberto alone for that. As the boat was on her way to the ship, with tlhe la- t freight, I run my boat so near her as to entangle the dragging-irons I had taken on board, in case of being overhauled by the guarS-boat that I might say I had been drag ging for the kedge. The irons being thrown carelessly athwart the bows for this purpose, I seized rry lantern, jumped forward to clear him, and in doing so threw a hasty glance tntd-his boat, where were sonle ten or fifteen bIrees I nark'd B-' After cle ring him, tht   mate asked me if I would not lend a hand i hoisting the boxes on deck, as they were very heavy, being filled with iron ballast. "'Well, I don't care if I do, said I, we- inng I have been drifting about here this how or two in search of an old kedge, without sac. cess; and mayhap, Mr. Mate, you have  drop of the real Jamaica with you?  "'Plenty of it, my friend; so make fast and jump on board.' "Well, seeing your honor's short of hands, ---for he had but two men with him -'I don't care if I give you a pull.' We got alongside, and 'U a fiw aiautes had the boxes stowed away in the run---to trim ship, being a 'little by the head.' the mate said. We then covered themrwith hides I expressed some surprise at his stowing hides there, but he said he did it to prevent the cargo being overhauled by that d---d Roderigo, of the Meteor, in case they should be so unfortunate as to fall in with him. "Were there any arms on board?" "Only a few old rusty cutlasses and mus- kets." "Well, Roberto, those boxes we must nave on board the Meteor to-night. So now, let's to the pinnace." The Captain and first Lfieutenant of the Meteor then carelessly sauntered oft; and in r a few minutes were on boari the boat, which I lay near by, in wait for them. "Shove off and let fall," said Roderigo, a' he seated himself, with Roberto, in the stern- sheets. "Keep her away a little, Marline." "Aye, aye, sir," responded the coxswain, as he placed the helm a little more to wind- ward; and the beautiful pinnace of the Me- n teor, under the influence of good oars, in the e hands of eight athletic men, soon shot under cover of the land, and was safely alongside n the barque, which was snugly riding at an- e, chor under the Highlands, complete y secure ir from observation. :,  The model of the Meteor was faultless ln long and deep waisted) about four hundre i, e t but notseeming more than three hundred toss     ourthen, painted black, with a :.arrow white streak, copper bottom, mountirg twenty guns, with a complement of five hundred picked metl, every one devotedly attached to their eommander. She was schooner-rigged, her mastr Ntraight as an arrow, but raked very much; her ) ads painted black, and on a wa- ter-level, her standing and running rigging well set up and hauled taught, and every rope, Oelayed and neatly coiled: her decks showed ar iirimate acquaintance with the holystone, and were as smooth as polished marble, while her "tout ensemble" ;was that of perfect neat- nDes. On reaching her quarter-deck, Roderigo instantly, issued orders to weigh anchor and make sail. The shrill whistle of the bo at- swain was soon heard, piping the- hands to their duty.; the capstan was speedily man- nied, while the topmen nimbly ran aloft to shake out .her canvas. "Anchor short!" Again the boatswain's whistle piped to man the topsail-sheets and halyards, and soon the lower corners of the topsail were hauled taught home, and the yard. hoisted to the utmost height its canvas would admit. Again the capstan is manned, and, to the lively notes of the fife, the anchor soon makes its appear- ance above the surface of the vater, and is securely catted. Now, in quick succession, fall the orders upon the ears of the livelym en, to man the jib and flying-jib halyards, and as the Meteor gracefully falls off; mainsail and foresail, top-gallant and royal sky-sail, and gatf-sail, as if by magic, spread their ut- most extent to the breeze. The gallant ves- sel rushed onward, to ssing the foaming bil- lows carelessly aside, as she cleared a. pas- sage through them. '.he place where the Meteor had been riding at anchor was about nine miles from the quay whence the Canso took her departure, butl the entrance to -it from the- sea was fifteen miles to leeward. The Canso was now well out, and gaily speeding onward, with a fair wind and flow- ing sheet. Her only passengers were Count Montmorency and his lovely daughter Eliza- beth. The Count, after a long residence in India, where he had amassed immense wealth, was obliged to quit the country on account of ill health; and taking with him his only child, his wife having died in the East, he 'embarked for England, and thence sailed for Jamaica, where they had now been residing for four years. The climate proving benefi- cial, and his health being entirely restored, he was again leaving for Old gland, their native home.  Count Montm r T v was about sixty years of age, of ahoble, com- manding appearance, and an eje and firm-set lip, hat denoted an active andesolute mind. But how shall we describe the fair Eliza- beth  1 Her form was faultless; those eyes, those bright and laughing. orbs, one. glance from which would transport the beholder as their joyous rays flashed upon hinl; those eyes so clear were of a dark, deep blue, sur- rounded by the most delicately pencilled eye- brows, and seemed the portals from which peeped cupids an' laughter-loving nymphs   innumerable; cheeks, whose hue might well cause the mosq-lose to hide its head; lips, whose richness the goddess of health herself could not outvie; teeth that one might affirm were India's brightest pearls; and gracefully curved neck, as white as the virgin snow; made up the beau-ideal of all things lovely. "Dear father,' she said, as she tossed aside the thick clusters of auburn ringletsi that were reposing on her cheek. "dear fa- ther, do you know how nuch I should like to see that far-famed, and to some, terrible Roderigo? Do you t}ink we shall meet with him?" "I hope not, my love; for if he should fall in with us here, I fear me your loveliness and innocence would hardly save us from insult and robbery by this lawless rover and his band of bravos." "But, Father, it is said that he is ex tremely civil and gentlemanly in his deport- ment, and that his menare in perfect subjec tion to him; and as his only object seems money, le of course will not harm us, for we have none in. our vessel,"' neither she nor her. father knowing of the specie on board; the Count's property being securely invested in England, from whence he had drawn in bills of Exchange, as often as he was in want. "True, my dear, we know not of any valu- able property in the Canso, but should we fall in with this freebooter he will not sufier us to escape till after a-strict search; and should it prove fiuitless, the disappointment may provoke him or his men to acts of violence. I pray- God we may not meet with him." It was now about three o'clock in the after- noon. The good ship had left the land far out of sight, and was rapidly pursuing a North-east course, with all sail set, and with every prospect of making a quick and pleas ant voyage. "Is not that a vessel, sir?" said Elizabeth addressing Capt. Scott, who had at that mo- ment joined them in their promenade of the quarter-deck. "Is not that a vessel, sir,?" as she pointed to a little speck, far distant in the horizon, on the weather-bow. "I believe it is, madam," replied the cap tain, and at the same moment ordered -the steward to bring his glass After attentive- ly examining it, he pronounced it a ship. standing for them, under full sail; adding, "I should think he was a man-of-war, by his appearance." . Do you often meet with Government ves sels here, Captain Scott?" said Count Mont moren v. "No, sir, but I understand government has recently ordered two more vessels to this sta- tion, to cruise in search of the-notorious Me. teor that has made such havoc with our ship- ping, and this is probably one of them." "Have you ever me: with this freebooter? continued the Count. "Yes, sir, twice; the last tine about foun months since. When ten days on: he board- ed me, said the British government had been rather remiss of late in forwarding him funds and as there was some inconvenience 'tend   tng a .ril to London at that time, he would , relieve mc of the anxiety I mus, fed in having not qo much money 'on board. (I had about five thousand pounds, and how he knew it I can't fou imagine.) Then without giving re time to an aeny the fact, he described the packages and ( wenti tied where they were stowed, rewark- we ing that he was thus particular in giving ten their appearance and location as he presumed as I must have forgotten the circumstance of &c their having been put on board for him; and cal begged me to order my men to be lively, as he wh did not wish to deprive me of the fine wind bo that was blowing, hinting that. perhaps it ex( would be more agreeable to have my own men hoist the money into theboats alongside, sir (where sat s me twenty of his crew fully te armed,) than to put him to the unpleasant  duty of ordering his men up. "Fo " said he In "my men, seeing what a beautiful ship you  have, might take a fancy to her." Finding wl resistance hopeless, and believing with him m that his men had better stay where they were, re I ordered the money to be put in the boats.  He then very politely begged me to give his hi compliments to his friend George, and thank ly him in his name for having sent him that vmall sum, for which he gave me h' receit S on account; and touching his hat, .ae me fc good bye and a pleasant voyage, descended to his boat and was rowed on board his ves- s; sel, lying about a quarter of a mile to wind- n ward." In a short time the strange vessel had ap- n proached within speaking distance, and run- a ning close aboard, demanded what ship she d was, where from and bound. Capt. Scott, al- ready trumpet in hand, replied that it was  the Canso, nine hours from Jamaica, bound X for London, and in return asked the name of o his interrogator. "H. B. M. sloop of war Fredonia: put down your helm and come on board with your papers," was the reply---and in a few mo- ments the Canso was lying withher head to the wind, waiting for her boat in which was Capt. Scott and his papers, on its way to the Fredonia. On reaching her deck, Capt Scott was received by the first Lieutenant and con- ducted to the cabin, where sat his commander Lord Dash.  Motioning him to be seated, "I am sorry, sir," said Lord Dash, "to cause you so much trouble, but I am ordered to ex- amine strictly every vessel I may fall in with on this station ;" and after examining his papers, continued---"Capt. Scott, I presume --I am very happy to see you, sir. Have yonr seen any vessels since you came out?" ' Your's is ,he first I have rnet with, sir, since I left po'.. Were there many vessels in port when you left, Capt. Scott?"  No, sir, onlv the brig America waiting cargo, brig Trim for N. York, schooner Ve- lasco from Bermuda, and one or two others, names no -recollected." Did you see anything among them of a / ratical rig?" "There was nothing of the kind in port when I sailed."   "Have you heard anything lately of the notorious Roderigo?" "No, sir, not since he boarded me about four months since, off the British Channel, and robbed me of five thousand pounds.' Capt. Scott then related the circumstance we have before mentioned. Lord Dash lis- tened with the most profound attention a nt asked him to describe the hull, rig, tonnage, &c. of the 'Meteor, the number of guns she carried and complement of seamen, a! of which he carefully noted in his memorar, -'m book;' and then reading what he had written exclaimed: "The same, by Heaven! Do you know, sir, that this daring scoundrel had the eflron- tery, about a month after boarding you, to at- tack, in the British Channel, the British East Indiaman, Hercules, mounting twenty guns with a valuable cargo of teas and silks which, after an engagement of ten or fifteen minutes, he carried by boarding; and after removing all hands to his own craft, set fire  to the Hercules, with a cargo valued at five hundred thousand pounds, which was entire- ; ly consumed."  t "He is indeed a daring fellow," said Capt. t. Scott, ;but how, my Lord, did you get in- e formation of this high-handed affair?" d  "I will tell you, sir; immediately after be - saw the Hercules well enveloped in flames, he - made all sail for the Irish Coast, where he landed the passengers and crew about ten - miles from any dwelling---leaving with them - an ample supply of provisions, water, and a e dozen of excellent cordial for the ladies, there I- being six of them. These ladies while on s board his own vessel, he treated with the ut- id X most politeness and- attention, frequently of sending into their cabin choice sweetmeats dried fruits, wines and cordial: and whei at about landing them on a wild and barrel ur shore again apoligized for the inconvenience o- he must thus necessarily' cause them, "as" to said he, "you must know that I very much as fear those little tongues would soon send me he too much company for my comfort, were I ott to land you at a more thickly inhabited part ,n- of the country." Handing them into the er, boat, which was to conduct them ashore and ed, assuring them that he sincerely regretted the ise loss of their society, he begged of each her ac- x- ceptance of a splendid diamond ring, respect- ith fully raised his cap and bade them adieu. his After nmny days delay and some inconvience me the crew and passengers of the Hercules ar- ive rived safely at Liverpool, where their narra- tive of the affair caused the greatest excite- sir, ment. The Admiralty issued orders for the immediate departure of the Fredonia, and two you frigates, in pursuit of this gentlemanly pirate. and in the event of our not coming up with in- him  on the coast, to scour these seas Ve- where, it is presumed, he is now prcv ing ers, about." "Well. my Lord, I wish you much success in your enterprise, and now, if you have no farther occasion for my presence, I trust you will permit me to pursue my ve -age." "Certainly, sir, but before you leave me,     allow me the pleasure of a glass of wine with I you, Capt. Scott" After tossing off a glass to mutual goc'l wishes, the cor maander of the Canso took his leave and was soon on her deck, when she lled away and was once more pursuing a rapid course toward her destined haven. The Fredonia. which was also lying to, during the visit of Capt. Scott, now wore ship, and again stood for the South West. She was so com- pletely disguised as a merchantman, that none but those well acquainted with her, could have detected the man-of-war at a suf- ficient distance to escape her guns, and hence arose the mistake of those on the decks of the Canso. Lord Dash was one of those bantlings of the British Admiralty, who had in reality no qualification for the station he held, but for whom the influence of his wealthy uncle, the Marquis of Wineford, had procured the, com- mand of the beautiful ship Fredonia, one of the fastest sailers in the British Navy. He was a young man, about thirty years, of ra- ther prepossessing appearance, but of a rash and ardent temperament, and far better fitted for the drawing-room than the quarier-deck of a man-of-war. he was not, however, des- titute of courage, but lacked that coolness and self-possession in times of emergency so requisite, so highly important, .to his resposi- ble station. His sad deficiency too, in nau- tical matters, often exposed him to the ridi- cule of the brave tars under his command, and as often to the ill.-suppressed smiles of his officers. Still Lord Dash, on the whole, was not disliked by officers or men, for he pos- sessed an easy disposition andwas more ready to forgive then punish a fault. We have said that he was rash---y3et he sometimes err- ed on the other extreme, and his overprudence would cause him to lose all the advantage he might have reaped by a medium course. His first Lieutenant, Mr. Transom, was about five years his senior, and was in every respect a perfect seaman, having been in active service for twenty-five years, and signalized' himself in many hard-fought battles; in the last of which, in consequence of his superiors hav-' ing all fallen, he was elevated from the third to the filst Lieutenancy. "Well, Mr. Transom:," said Lord Dash, as he paced the quarter-deck, "I think we must fall in with this precious rascal soon, for I have good reason to believe he is somewhere about here." I certainly hope we may, my Lord, but may I presume to inquire why you thick he must be here?" "Because, sir, it is so well known that large remittances are making to this quarter, and wherever the prey there may be expected the vulture, eh! Mr. Transom, don't you say so?" said Lord Dash, highly delighted with his proverb. "But, my Lord, d' you not think he will be very cautious in his approach, knowing as he must, that there arc many gunners prowl- ing about the prey, in hopes of getting a shot lI him  The my word for it this ianr us   Roderigo is too old a bird to be caught with- in smell of gunpowder. "Very true, and I am told his vessel is a perfect devil for sailing. But should he fall in with us, I think we are so disguised that he will not be able to discover our t-ae cha- racter; once within reach of our gun3 we will soon put an end to his proud career." "Sail ho!" resounded from the fore-top. "Where away?" replied both Lord Dash and Mr. Transom at the same instant. "About two points on the weather-bow." In a moment Mr. Transom had ascended to the top with his glass. "What do you make of her, Mr. Transom?" hailed his commander. "She appears a rakish-looking schooner, and I should think sees us, for she isstanding directly for us under a press of sail," 'said Mr. T., as he descended from the fore-top, and joined Lord Dash on the quarter-deck. "She is certainly a suspicious looking craft, and from the crowded appearance ot her decks, I should think was no other than the Meteor," said the latter officer, as he laid down the glass. "He thinks, undoubtedly, that he will pick some good plums from us; and, by my faith, he shall not be mistaken, though I can't promise that he will fnd them very digestible. Mr. Transom, give her the sky-sails, and order the men to be lively and turn out the guns; and harkee, Mr. Tran- som, see that they are all double-shotted." "But, my Lord, may I presume to sug- gest-" "Not a word, if you please, Mr. Transom  he cannot escape us now. Order the boat- swain to pipe all hands to quarters, and the topmen to make all sail ;" and addressing the man at the wheel, -Lord Dash ordered the ship to be laid close to the wind. The Lieutenant bowed in silence, and pre- pared, with deep mortification, to execute the orders of his commander; for he was satis- fied that the stranger was yet too far off for them, should 'he discover their disguise., which he would most probably do were these orders to be carried into effect; nevertheless, he was his commander, and, as such, could not lightly be disobeyed. Mr. Transom was not mistaken, for as soon as the fore-sky-sail-sheets fell from the yard, the stranger was discovered to have wore ship, and to be standing on the same course as the Fredoni a. "Aye, aye, my good fellow, so you smell a rat, do you? Give him a gun, Mr. Transom, and. let's see if he will obey the summons." Immediately a lee gun was fired from the Fredonia, and the British ensign run up to peak, which was answered by'a stern gun from the stranger, whose shot came rocket- ting through the water, and sunk about a pistol shot ahead of them. "Well done, my beauty, and there goes his bunting,:' said Lord Dash, as the Meteor displayed at her main peak her ensign of lei anc white stripes, with the mbtto in the cen- tre, "FRER AS AIR."  "Well. I like tha amazingly," ccf'inued he., addressing his   ist ] aieuter ant, who had resumed his station cove after seeing all sail made and the ship in disc readiness for immediate action; "the fellow is very civil to give us his card and show his add true colors, for he might have led us a daace ster in the dark as to his character. Blow, my gooi breezes, for an hour or two, and then be 1 you may be calm for a month if you will." (an "We gain on him fast, my Lord," said the Ir. Transom, "if we had an hour Jr two fell more daylight, he could not escape us." car too -bre CHAPTER   II.  '? Roberto, man the topsail halyards, and an give them another pull-so-well that-be- al ,ay," and the beautiful Meteor flew through ste he water with the speed of the dolphin. Still lee the Fredonia gained on her, and had now ter opened a fire from her bow chasers, ian hopes the to cripple her in her spars; but as yet she to received no injury, and pursued her wild and tO rapid flight.              wa "They are overhauling us fast, Roberto," pr said Roderigo, as a ball flew over the quarter dy ieck and. fell in the water to windward, just ke abaft the main-chains. "Man the stern- br chasers and let them see we can play a little pi at this game. Now men, take goqd. aim at se her foremast, and let her have it as soon te as she begins to rise. There! blaze away, tl my men!" and seizing his glass, he exclaim- t ed, " that was well, my lads," as he saw the e splinters fly in clouds from the bows of the w Fredonia.                a "Stand back, Bob, and let me have a squint at her," said Splinters, captain of the fore-  op, to one of the men at the lee gun.; " 'taint o )ften I miss my mark, and I'm blessed if I s don't pitch them ere foretop-men a plum." d "Bravo! bravo! Splinters," said Roderi- e go, as the fore top-mast of the frigate fell 1 over her side in acknowledgement of the re:-  ception of the promised " plum." This sue-  cess of the captain of the fore-top was hailed with three cheers from the crew of the Me- teor, and the stern-chasers w;ere discharged in rapid succession, each discharge making  terrible work on board the Fredonia, which had now approached so near as to' overreach the Meteor with her guns, her shot generally passing about ten feet above her decks, and falling some distance ahead on the lee-bow. The latter vessel had as yet met with no injury in her spars or hull. "Jump up there, topmen, and bend on top-gallant halyarlds" cried Roderigo, as the top-gallant yard fell from the mast and hung by the lifts, a shot from the Fredonia having carried away the  main-top-gallant-mast, grazed the fore-top-mast, and cut away the top-gallant halyards. The frigate still seem- ed to hold her own, and was firlng canister and grape; the shot from which fell around the Meteor like hail, and was beginning to tut her sails and rigging, though as yet it had wounded but two of her mena and those but slightly. It was now quite dark, and the riliation of the two vessels ce 'aid only be dis-   covered by the flashes which proceeded each discharge of their guns. "Would it not be well, sir," said Roberto, addressing his commander, " to set he lower stern-sails now?"  "Yes, Roberto, and then order the men o be lively and get out the boat with old Tomr (an old gun to be placed in the stern-sheets of the boat), " and mind, Roberto, give the old fellow a good mouthful of grapes, and be careful that you do not make the boat drnia too fast, for they cannot come up with her this breeze short of two hours." "Aye, aye, sir," responded the Lieutenant, "will see it done in ship-shape manner ; and in a few moments the boat was launched alongside, old Tom securely fastened in the stern-sheets, a. large square-sail rigged, the lee tact of-which was hauled well aft, a Ian- tern lashed about midway of the mast, and the helm of the boat secured amidships, so as to keep her head about south-west (the course the two vessels were steering); a slow match was then lighted, communicating with the priming of the gun, and everything being rea- dy, the boat was suffered to fall astern, and kept in tow for a few minutes, till she felt the - breeze and got headway of her own. The : painter of the boat which kept her fast to the t schooner was then cut adrift, and every lan:' tern on board carefully shaded so as not to throw out, a ray of light. The Meteor then - tacked and stood a south-east course,' with e every stitch of canvas she could muster, e while the boat kept on her rapid flight with a strong southerly wind. t   *  *. *  *  *   *  * -' Im d---d if that ere feller han't the eyes it of the devil himself to see this darlk night," I said an old salt in the fore-sheets of the Fre- donia, as he rolled on deck minus a leg, in i-- company with some dozen of his messmates "Iess fortunate than himself, who took the op- e- portunity afforded them by the vomiting forth c- of old Tom's grapes to pay the debt of nature. ed "Heave to there, I say, Bill, and lend us a e- hand to stop this leak in my starboard lower ed spar; and bear a hand, my hearty, or it will iag be shoal water with me'directly," added the ch brave old tar, as hiscomrade hastened to his ch assistance and carried him below. 1ly Lord I)ash paced the quarter-deck with nd rapid steps, pale with rage at the havoc made w. by the fire of the Meteor, which had indeed no been deadly, fifty of his men having' fallen and his spars, sailsrigging, and hull, all bear- on ing strong evidence cf the schocuer's sk;!l' i the gunnery. ng  "Do we gain on the d--d scoundrel? ing shouted he to Mr. Transom, who had taken "Sir, his station on the forecastle to watch more the closely the chase. "Do we gain on the dev i im- sir?'" ter "I think we are ovehauling him again, and sir-I occasionally get a glimpse of his lights to on the weather-bow." t it  "Is he satisfied with the havoc he has ose made that he has ceased firing, or is he me- the ditating some new caper?" said Lord Dash Uis-. "I think, my Lord, that since we have As     tinguished the lights, not being able to see us, he is reserving his fire." "Well, let him do so if he likes, for we shall soon be up with him, and he will need all his powder to save his neck from our fore- yard-arm; for, by heavens, I will string him up these before to-morrow's sun sets, if I catch him." "Will it not be as well, my Lord, to reserve our fire, as it is impossible to see him distinct- ly, and the firing retards our progress?" "Very true. Order the men, Mr. Transom, to give another pull at the halyards and bra- ces." All hands were now busily employed in re- pairing damages, and in carrying below the wounded. The ship continued on her course at a rapid rate, dashing high the waves with her prow as if mad at being so long baulked of her prey. About three hours after having discontinued her. shots. the ship having gain- ed the weather-guageof the chase, Lord Dash ordered the larboard guns to be double shot- ed, the boarders to be mustered and ready to board the enemy after the first broadside; "u and mind, my hearties," said he, addressing the men at their stations, "give the scoundrels no quarter." "Aye, aye, sir," responded the men one and all, fore and aft, as they grasped their weapons with a convdilsive and determined grip, and flourished their sabres over their heads--"We will give a good account of them, sir, after we once get upon her decks." "That's right, my lads---and now, all fiat on your backs, for we are close alongside the precious scoundrel, and my word for it, he is not going to let us come on his decks i without a salute from his artillery." In a moment all hands were flat on the deck of the Fredonia, save her Commander and first Lieutenant, who took their stations well aft on the quarter-deck. The ship was now rapidly approaching the enemy and not more than halfpistol-shot distant. Lord Dash de- t ermined toreserve his fire till he should run close alongside, grapple with him, then pour a full broadside into hirm, and board fore and aft at the same moment. "What can the fellow mean by his silence, Mr. Transom?" "I think, my Lord, that finding escape hopeless, he is hardy enough to venture to come into close action with us." "We shall soon see what he means; let her falloff a little, Mr. Transom---there, that wiA do," said he, as the ship fell alongside the chase. "Now my men, blaze away," he shrieked in his impetuosity, "and tumble aboard, eyery mother's son of you." At the instant, every man was on his feet, the larboard gun-tier poured forth its whole broadside, the boarders with the activity of monkeys sprang into the rigging and clam- bered over the nettings of the Fredonia, while some with the daring natural to the excite- ment of the moment, sprang over the qhip's sides .risting to chance to land them o0 the P nemy's deck,but to their astonishment t 'ind themselves in the water   "On board, .all!' shouted Mr. Transom through his trumpet; "the rascal has sif:- ped through our fingers. Heave over tht life-buoy, and stand by to lower the boat 1 lump in some half-dozen of you---hard lee your helm!" "Aye, aye, sir; hard lee it is, sir," replied the man at the wheel, as he put the helm down and brought the ship up in the wind. "There, let fall," said Transom, taking the helm of the cutter, " shove off and pull with a will, my lads."  In a short time the boat returned, having picked up all the men safe and sound, with no other injury than a good ducking, which had not, however, in the least cooled their courage, but, on the contrary, made them more anxious to revenge the additional in- sult of a wet jacket. The Fredonia as yet remained lying' to, and her Commander and first Lieutenant retired to the cabhl to con- sult the best course to pursue. Meanwhile the men had assembled forward and in groups about the deck, speculating on the mysterious disappearance of the chase. "Shiver my timbers, if that ere fellow ain't the devil's own pilot; for as we lay on-our beam-ends I had a squint at him through one of the ports, and he loomed up like a light. house--'hiseye-swre as big as my head, and his swabs looked like great coats of fire." "You're right, Bill," said one of his hear- ers, "for I'm blessed if I didn't see him sla: his tail on the taffrail just as we were order- ed to fire." "Avast there and belay," said the boat swain's-mate, who had come up to the group in time to hear the latter remark---"'llll tel. you what 'tis, old boys, you're all on the wrong tack. That ere feller was no other than the Flying Dutchman, for after we fired our broadside at him, I could distinctly see them take their pipes out of their mouths and blow out the smoke we had driven into their noses---and one old son of a gun said, just as I made a spring for the rigging 'dat ish ver nish,' so, you see, I tells Bill who was in my wake, says I, 'Bill, 'taint no sort o' use no how, boardin' this feller, seeing as how he's the Flying Dutchman.' Ynudonht say so, Jack,' said Bill, and at that he gave his quid a roll over his starboard tiero' grind. ers, and, his daylights a rub---for you see, Bill, as well as myself, was kinder obfusticated with the excitement." "Blow me, if that ain't the Gospel truth ot the whole matter," answered Bill, as a heavy lurch of the ship brought him all standing in the midst of his comrades, "Jack is right, for d---m my buttons, if I didn't see that ere same feller off the Horn, last cruise of the Arabella, and I'm blessed if he didn't have that same pipe in his mouth. I know'd it by the sarpent's head which at every puff, sent out a blue flame half a fathom long." "Well, Bill, spin us that yarn 'bout the' cruise of old Bella, for I've hearn tell that the old fellow tried to run you down," said oru of the group. '"That he did, my lads, and no thr nks t   him .hat he d dn't succeed-Well then, mess- a mates, if you've a mind to hear my yarn, just w heave alongside," said Bill, as he seated a himself under the lee of the ibre-mast, "and C just come to an anchor here and I'll give it a toyou." So replenishing his mouth with a S fresh quid of pigtail and giving it a grip or E two with his teeth t, freshen his ideas- g "Mayhap some ce you remember the old o Bella: she was as fin, a ship as ever swam, o peace to her poor old bones! her logs run out ii two years come next pay-day, and old Davy e has taken a turn round her ribs and laid her fe up in ordinary in his locker, with some three h or four hundred as brave lads as ever broke f a biscuit. There was Sam. Tarbox, him as a was spliced to that neat little frigate Nancy, i in our village; you know, Bob, just before f the Bella sailed-"           a "Aye, aye, I remember her, poor Nance, v Lord bless her little soul, she followed her M Sam," said Bob, as he hastily brushed his s hand. across his weather-beaten face, "there a she used to sit day after day at her little win- s dow looking out to sea, and her poor old mo- f ther takin' on so, and telling her that Sam 1 would soon be back; then she would turn and look up in the old lady's face so, and shake  her head so melancholy like, that shiver my 1 timbers, bat it always used to choke my eye-  pumps to see her. I say Jack, give us the paniken, this bacca makes my throat kinder  husky like." "And there was Bob Backstay," resumed Bill, " as good a feller as ever trod a plank, had a heart as'big as a meetin' house, and Tom Marline, him as was jilted by Bet Savils. Poor Tom! he never held his head up after Bet ran away with that Lord- what do you call him? Oh, poor Tom! I think I see him now with his arms folded, standing on the forecastle, smiling on the waves that were fast curling over us---- But avast there and belay, my messmates, while I wear ship, for I've drifted out of my course and was to spin you a yarn about the Dutchman. Well then, you must know we had been boxing the compass off the Horn about ten days, more or less, when one morning about six bells, wind j nor-nor-west, blowing a real screamer, Who should we see but this very devil we've been chasing to-night, dead ahead on us sailing right in the wind's eye-" "Avast there, Bill, and tell that ere. to the marines! how the devil could he sail in the wind's eve and blowin' a gale too! Blast me if I can go that!" "Clap a stopper on your gab, Tom, and  don't be interrupting. Don't you know the Flying Dutchman always carries his own breeze? now don't be putting me off my t ack. Well then, as I was sa ing, down he comes  on us, with all his rags stt, and carrying a feather in his mouth' as big as our ship. Lord bless me! how his craft cut the water, she would mind no more of a sea as big as our village than the Fredonia would of the wake of the dolphin, b-at cut right through it tossing the- water in a sheet of foam to' her -sky-sail mast-head. On she came, and when   abt st a-mile away, ild Spike, the gunner, went aft tothe mainmast, doffct li , tarpaulin and asked permission to 'speak with the Commodore. The first Lull told him to go aft, and ascending the quarter-deck, "Well, Spike, what's wanted now?" "Please your Honor, an you'd be willing, I should liKe to give that there old feller what's coming down on us, a bit of our holy-stone to rub off some of his ill manners." "Well, Spike, clap it into long Tom, and mind you put in powder enough to send it well into him." "Never fear that, yer Honor, I'll see that it boards him," and making his manners he joined us forward. We soon had old Tom, one of the weather-bow guns, loaded--Spikes clapping in a piece of holy-stone as big as a twenty- four pounder-and taking his station to get a good sight of the feller we waited till he was about a half cable's distance, when old Tom blazed away, and my eyes! how the splinters did fly aboard on him, and the curses and gibberish that we heard from his decks seemed as if Beelzebub's own crew had broke from their mooring. Well, down. he went like a lump of lead, and old Spikes sung out, "you've found your port at last and be d-d to you," but he had hardly godTO words out before, on looking astarn, thereras the feller going off as if nor anything had happened, and it's my opinion, shipmates, that this ere feller that we gave a bellyful of shot just now, is just one and the same consarn as him that sarved that caper off the Horn; so mates, take a turn there, for that's the end of my yarn." "Well," said Jack, " now I recollects, and I'm blowed if Ididn't see, after the smoke had cleared the decks, something like a white 'cloud just aft the starboard main chains, kinder swimming the sea as it were-and feather my jacket, if I don't believe that was old Mynheer looking after his pipes and may- hap,-" At this moment the shrill whistle of the boatswain fell sharply on their ears,. quickly scattering the party under the lee of the fore- mast, as the order ran through the ship to Itake in sail. The men sprang aloft, and as ' thev reached the several places assigned them, laid out on the yards; and sky-sail, royal and top-gallant sail, fore, main and'mizzen, were soon furled snugly and securely to their , several yards, the men a gain descending to the  deck as fast as they accomplished the work  for which they had been sent aloft. The ship was now reduced to her three top-sails '(a fore-top-mast and its lighter yards and e spars having been set up during the chase) i and was still lying with her main-top-sail aback. Thewind had died away to a perfect s calm the air was close an] sultry, the stars were hid behind a canopy of dull brassy look-  ng clouds and the sea rose and fell in lazy undulations, its surface dotted here and there s with those sparkling bubbles peculiar to a e certain state of the atmosphere; every thing t around, low and aloft, seemed to be taking r breath for some new exertion. The ship, n i too, seemed conscious of some great and sud-     den change about to take place, as her yards plie and booms gave forth their dismal moanings,  reanting a loneliness and dreariness of feeling sna about the heart, something akin to that ex- dec perienced by the landsman when for the first ed  Lime in his life he is taking a lesson in sea- wit sickness. T le volatile spirits of the seamen had have taken the alarm and fled, leavingin their  place countenances expressive of anxiety anrd re forebodings. Not a word is uttered by one of the them, but many a restless eye scans the hea- I vens and sweeps the horizon, followed by aur knowing shake of the head, a lifting of the ing shoulders, and a fresh turn of the quid. All the -*-all is still as death, save the dismalwi- fro ings and moanings of the ship as she heavily and lazily rises ant falls with the sea, like sai the dull, sleepy, reeling motions of the toper  in the last stages of deep inebriation. The  air itself seems to have come to a dead stand tha as if uncertain what to do. The spirits ofha all on board sink in proportion as the barome- T ter rises, while here and there a shark1 dread an monster of the deep and king of terrors to the ch shipwrecked mariner, maybe seen swimming af slowly round the ship, eyeing them with hun- pu gry and greedy jaws. Presently a low, faint wz rumbling breaks on their startled senses, like st the sound of the far-distant thunder, and the w air seems hot and life!ess as it comes in board ni on the starboard beam., and falls on theirfa- e ces scorching and suffocating, as if from a ro heated oven.              c "Let fly everything, and hard a starboard B you helm," roared Transom, through his n trumpet, "' lay on there, top men, and belively m my hearties; furl everything snug, for by the c Gods we-shall have a screamer." Almost as t quick as thought these .orders were executed, si the yards squared and their sails firmly lash- w ed to .them.              r 'Give her a piece of the jib-so-helay A that," said Transom, as the jib was hoisted i about halfway up. ,A11 now awaited in breath- c less anxiety the approach of the hurricane, s whose tremendous violence in those seas few j n board had not witnessed. The horizon on  :heir staiboard had assumed a wild and un- s arthly glare, sky and sea seeming one entire mass of foam. Now the air is rent with the cries of the storm-spirits as they come madly careering towards the ship, roaring and hiss- ing, tumbling and howling, the sea foaming like one vast boiling cauldron. "Starboard all, and hold on foryourlives, shrieked Transom, as the tempest struck them, covering them with spray, twisting and snapping like pipe-stems her three top-gallant masts, blowing the jib from the stay as if it had been paper, and throwing the ship on her oeam-ends. The jib, however, had held on ong enough to pay off the ship's head a'point or two before she was thrown down. "Cut away," shouted Transom through his trul- net, to the men whom he had stationed before tlhe storm boarded them, to the starboard side of the shi p with their axes in case of necessi- ty-"Cut the weather-lanyards fore and aft, f(r he well knew that thcy would soon foun- , . f -v- a; ,* b ih nMri"kl" rav" mnar   plied their knives and axes mer'i and in a few monients the mast, as if brittle glass; snapped asunder about a foot or two above deck and tell to leeward, as the ship, lighten- ed of the weight, slowly rose to the even keel with three feet of water in her hold. -She had now swung round so as to present her stern to the wind, and although a complete wreck, not a spar standing, she flew before the tempest with a frightful speed. Fortunately, her rudder was as yet unin- jured, and if they could keep her from broach- ing to, there was some hope of her outliving the storm. All hands that could be spared from the pumps, were now busily engaged rigging jurymasts and endeavoring to get some sail on to keep her steady. The carpenter was again ordered to sound the pumps, and quickly the alarming news was reported, that the water was increasing fast,'having gained half a foot since they commenced pumping. The ship was now lightened; her guns, shot, and everything heat v, except one anchor and chain, were speedily thrown into the sea and after incredible exertion of the men at the pumps, the leak was got at and stopt. Day was fast dawning in the east, but the tempest still raged. fearfully--onward flew the ship with the speed of the sea-gull, the sea run- ning mountain-high and threatening them every instant with destruction, as it came rolling and tumbling after them, with foam- covered crests frowning high over their heads. I But the good Fredonia,A-on which they had now got, a piece of the foresail,) with undi- minished velocity. safely as yet continued her course, scudding before the wind till eight it, s the morning, when the gale abated and the sun burst from the dark canopy of clouds with - which he had been enshrouded, shining se- renely bright on the lashing, foaming ocean. y All hands were now busily employed in clear- d ing the wreck,' and setting what sail they - could on temporary spars. In a short time, e, spare fore, main, and mizzen topsails, foresail, w jib and spanker were set, the gale was settling in down to a gentle and pleasant breeze, and the n- sea fast dying away.. re 3s-      CHAPTER   III. Roderigo, after his successful manceuvre ," the last night, had immediately set all hands ck to work in changing the rig of the Meteor nd from. that of a schooner to a full rigged brig. nt The guns were run in, sec ur'd. and covered ad from observation the ports all closed and a ier red strip of painted canvas tacked on the on white streak which encircled his hull. All int this was accompli shed before the tempest catme rut on, which to Rolerigo's experienced eye, was mn- well. known to be brewing and not far off. ore He anxiously and carefully scan ed the hea- ide vens, at'ntively watched the horizon all si- around the compass in order to catch the first ft indication of the quarter in which it might in- commence, and whilP thus employed com- inr mandrl4 RotnhPerr . halv al' the light spare   aad yards se:n lown and everyth;ag to be and made as gr ug as possible. The firt Lieu- fim tenant then ordered "he fore and main-royal, and top-gallant yaris and royal mast to be resp net down on deck, and top-gallait-mast to be sen housed.  "Let fly topsail-halyards and sheets, and if  lay out there lively, men, and furl sng every- ing ihing-don't let a ribbon be seen," shbuted Ro Roderigo, suddenly, as the men were descend- ria ag .from aloft, and as he saw a lead-colored say streak in the north-western horizon dead aft, "keep her as she goes, Backstay," addressing int the man at the wheel, "now in board and I' down all, and keep a sharp look out for your ger legs-and axemen, at your post," he continu- lar ed, as the tempest came screaming and roar- cot ing right aft, filling the air with rain, and hail, and spray of the sea. Notwithstanding h everything was snug and the vessel reduced ab to bare poles, exposing as little as possible to.: m the force of the wind, still when the teympest ag struck her, it lifted her stern high in the wa- m; ter and threatened to run her bows under. pil Soon after the first puff had passed over them, su "set a small ribbon of the foresail on her," ar shouted Roderigo, as she flew with the velo- tic city of lightning through the mlad billows. fr On the first approach of the storm, Roberto cl and Roderigo both sprung for the wheel, that ai safety-chain of a seaman's hopes, where they m remained during the whole of the time the g( gale lasted. The men had seated themselves in groups under deck about midships, in full confidence of the skill and seamanship of tl their superiors at the helm, not doubting the to safety of the vessel and all on board so lon ri as mortal arm could avail them.     st "My eyes, Bob, ain't she behaving nobly?" said old Splinters, " see how like a duck she b rides the seas! I'm blowed if I don't pity c them shore-going chips what are dodging 1 falling chimblys and dying timbers-how the d poor fellows will wish they Were aboard on us, n with the deep blue sea under 'em, plenty of V grog to wet their whistles, and sea-rcom in-  abundance. I wonder how old John Bull'  stands it; him, I mean, as was thinking to make is a present of a hemp cravat, ra- thanks a to his po iteness! I reckon as how we have saved old Boreas the trouble of pitching some of his spars into the sea, and poor old Tom too! didn't he speak like agentlernan? Shiver my timbers, if he hadn't the manners to give 'em a few of his grapes, though I'm thinking they weren't over and above acceptable, see- ing as how he had chawed 'em so. Well, ar- ter all, what can these old Johnny Bulls ex- pect but sour grapes, when they attempt to rob the vine? howsomedever, here's luck," said le, as he finished his yarn and emptied at a swallow the paniken of half its contents. "Whe w! how  it breezes 1' said Bob, ' this reminds me of the time when we were chased by that d-d parleyvous and dodged him in the dark. I was on the foreyard arm and turning to take a kinder aLantingdicular, squint of the wind, P'm blessed if it didn't blow mhy starboard eyetooth .ean out of its Pecke:s but I clinched it with my lower tier   and drove it horne again, where .es no firmly anchored." "I remembers that morning very well." responded Sam Starboard, "I'd just finished sending down the main-rial-yard, and was myself nearly to the maintop, when split me, if the squall didn't take me from my moor ings in less time than you could say Jack Robinson, and pitch me clear up to the fore- rial-mast head, where I came to an anchor safe and sound. "And a puff of the same squall came down into the ward-room," said Backstay, "and I'm blessed, if it did n't blow a bottle of raal geniwine jamaca into my hammock, where it landed bung up, but it sprung a leak before I could turn it, and all run out." In this way the old tars continued to spin their yarns till some time after the gale had abated, and they were summoned on deck to : make sail. The light spars and yards were again sent up; top-gallant-masts and royal masts, with their yards, secured in their proper places; top-gallant-sails and royals in quick succession spread their canvass to the wind, and the Meteor moved gracefully and majes- tically through the water, with a gentle breeze from the north-west. She was now sailing ) close hauled on the rind, heading due north; t and in 'this mannef they continued till the rmiddle of the afternoon, when the sea had e gone down. much. "Sail ho!" resounded from the fore-top. I "Where away?" replied Roderigo. "About f three points on the weather bow." Roderigc - took his glass, and quickly ascended the fore riging,where, after carefully scrutinizing the stranger, he returned to the quarter deck. ' "Roberto, order all the men into the hold e. but thirty, and bid them make themselves as y comfortable as they please, but not speak a g loud word.  Tell the men who, remain on ie deck that if we are boarded they are not to s, make any conversation with any one; that of we are about four months out from Ports- n- mouth, or a cruise in my Lord Peterborough's "' yacht, of seven guns and thirty men." to  This done, Roberto returned to his corn ks mander.  "What do you make of her? ve said he. ne "It is H. B. M. frigate, Isabella, Commodore m Smith," replied Roderigo, "I know him well, er He and Lord Peterborough's father used 'tc ve be old' cronies, though to my certain knowl- ng edge they have not met the last ten years. ee- and then Lord Peterborough's son so strong- ar- ly resembled myself that this same Smith x- frequently mistook me for him." rob ("But surely, Roderigo, you do not mean to lid hazard a discovery by boarding him?" ta  "( Never fear, Roberts, of his finding us out; he is a sleepy old fool and thinks more of his 3ob, comfort and good dinners than the interest of ere the service, and besides, Roberto, he is sent ted out here expressly to cruise for us and we rm must pu him out of the way." ilar  Rodle: igo also wished to ascertain if he In't had fallen in with the Canso, for beside the its money on board tie latter ship, there was tier another and still more powerful attractoua     for him-the icvely Elizcat th-to whom he had been int:odu(ed many weeks before, and with whom he had waltzed and had a delight- ful tete-a-tete at the Governor's house the evening previou, to the sailing of the ship. The frigate was now approaching them fast and had already displayed the British ensign. Roderigo ordered the Meteor to be hove to, the British flag to be hoisted at her peak, and also Lord Peterborough's private signal at the fore, while he quietly waited the Isabel- la's approach. Commodore Smith now run down, and passing under his stern, hailed u Brig ho! what's your name and destina- tion?"  Roderigo replied, "]Lord Peterborough's private yacht on a cruise, and, if agreeable, will lower my boat and come aboard with my respects." "Very happy to see you on board, my Lord," replied Commodore Smith, as he or- derer the man-ropes to be let down at the lee gangway. After giving orders to Roberto ,o fill -away, lay off and keep a sharp look out for the fri- gate while he remnained on board of her, add- ing that shoult',ny danger threaten him he would wave his handkerchief, in which event Roberto was to pour in a broadside and then board the frigate, her boat left the Meteor, and everything was got ready for immediate ac- tion. Commodore Smith received Roderigo at the gangway, remarking that he was very happy to see him, inquired for the health of his father, &c. "Why, my Lord, what a devilish fine craft you've got! Do you know, my Lord, that when I first descried your hull, I took-you for that devil of a sea-monster, the Meteor?" "Ha! ha! ha! did you indeed, sir?" ,aughingly replied Roderigo, "you do my yacht quite, an honor, I assure you, to take her for that bird. Why sir, she sails like the wind, and is as pretty a craft as your eyes ever lit upon." "Have you seen her, my Lord?" earnest- ly inquired the Commodore. "Yes, sir, and thanks to the darkness of last night for my escape." Roderigo then told him that they were chased by the Meteor the last evening, when standing in towards Cape Hatien, bat by changing his course to W. N. W. after dark he escaped from him. He then described his vessel as she was when achooner rigged, shortening his length of keel and breadth of beam somewhat, and also lead- ing him astray as to the general appearance of her hull and spars. At this moment the first Lieutenant of the Isabella who had been earnestly eynng the Meteor (not unnoticed, however, by her Com- mander,) came to the spot where his supe- rior and Roderigo were conversing, and, apologizing for the interruption, begged per- -mission to speak with his commander. Ro- deiigo bowed with ease and dignity to the salute of the first Lieutenant, and stepping aside begged that he might not prevent any e6mmAnication the gentleman wished to make. The two officers then commeri ed i   conversation in low and suodued voices, which from the earnestness on the part of the lieutenant an the attention of his com- mander, together with occasional glances from both directed towards the Meteor, with ever and anon a side-long look at himself, left Roderigo in no doubt as to its subject- matter. Still he retained his ease of manner and self-possession; and if he had been in doubt before, of the communication the lieu- tenart wished to make, those doubts were now dispelled, as in his warmth he raised his voice somewhat above its first pitch. "Mod- el same--changed rig-since--Indiaman can't be-know!Lord Peterborough and fanier- old friends-ha! may be so-try him, by Heavens!--horse run away-leg--Mameluke -precaution--prisoner-not pipe but--quar- ters." Roderigo had now heard enough to satisfy *him that if he was not discovered he was at least suspected by both the officers, and as he observed the lieutenant hastily quit his commander and descend from the quarter, he put his left hand in his pocket for his hand- kerchief, reserving his sword-arm unembar- rassed and free. As the Commodore sudden- ly turned, fixing a steady and penetrating look on him as if he would read his very soul, Roderigo perceived the men silently but actively. mustering at, the guns; he, how- ever, met the look directed towards him without a change of feature, seeming per- fectly unconscious of the nature of the con- versation held within his hearing. When they had gazed, each at the other, for some time in silence, the commander of the Meteor broke the restraint by saying, "Allow me to inquire, Commodore Smith, why I am honored by such a scrutinizing and suspicious look?" "Oh! I ask your pardon, Lord Peterbo. rough," abruptly exclaimed the Commodore; "I was thinking of an unpleasant piece of news I have just re6eived from Mr. Prevost, who' informs me that a favorite horse I havs on board has been cast and broke his leg. And, by the by, my lord, what has become of that horse I rode about ten years ago in company with your father and yourself, and who. run away with me, and finished his cruise that day by pitching me into the horse-pond?" "Oh! 'Old dare-devil Mameluke,' as we used to call him," good-humoredly replied Roderigo, who had at the time heard all the particulars, and knew the subsequent nistory of the animal, "Oh! Old dare-devil Maame- luke! I remember the circumstance plainly, and how you made the spray fly when you struck the water, ha ha!" and the Comrmo- dore could not but join in thelaugl when he remembered the ridiculous figure he cut when assisted out of the pond, after turning one or two somersets on its surface like a huge porpoise, much to the amusement of sundry youths, among whom was Roderigo, who had assembled round its banks to as- sist in his disembarkation. "Oh ' that dare- de il M;ameluke, we could do nothing with   him. The next week after you rode him, he e tried the same caper with our old fat parson,  Donaldson-you remember the iovial old fel- I low, without doubt?"  "Oh yes, my Lord, very well."  "Well, sir, we had been out all th? morn- 1 ing f x-hunting, and. weve b mneward bound, V when about three miles from the same pond t we started another fox. Mi tAt-'.uke, noLwith- I standing his top-hampej, took, as uxsual, the a lead, and scampered away .ver -hill and dale  till coming up with the fence that skirts the I park and essaying to leap it, his deck load  proved too heavy-for him and he feil breaking  the parson's neck and his own 'eg--so not to let the parson's death go unrevenged, we knocked old Mameluke, and made one wake of them both." :"Forgive me, my Lord. Peterborough, it is so many years since I had the pleasure of meeting with you, and your beautiful yacht so Strongly resembles the notorious Meteor, that I candidly confess I gave some credence to the suspicions of my first Lieutenant, Mr. Prevost, who has seen this famous tmuccaneer- ing craft, and I trust, my Lord, the little de- ceit I used in order to prove to my satisfac- tion-which I have done-your relationship to my old friend." Roderigo, with a slight seeming displea- sure, bade him say no more about it, adding that this was not the first time his vessel had been taken for the Meteor, and then in a careless, indifferent manner, asked Commo- dore Smith if he had met with many vessels- in his cruise, and concluded by offering to be the bearer of any despatch he might have in readiness, as he was bound for Portsmouth. The Commodore thanked him for his polite- ness, informing him that he had met with -but few vessels, one of which was the Canso, with whom he had parted company the last evening, before the storm came on; then as Mr. Provost came up, he introduced to him Roderigo as his particular friend, Lord Pe- terborough, and begged the'Lieutenant to entertain him while he, himself, stepped to the cabin to seal some papers which he in- tended availing himself of his friend's polite- ness, to-forward to England. He then with- ldew for a few moments, leaving the two gen- tlemen together on the quarter-deck. 'I hope, my Lord, you will forgive my unjust suspicions, but really your craft looks so much like that of the Meteor, and we be- ing ordered expressly to cruise for her, and well knowing, as I do, the skill and daring of the notorious Roderigo, I trust you will att:.bute my mistake to the natural effect of our desire to fall in with her." Roderigo begged him to think no more of it, and then to turn the conversation, compli- mented him on the beautiful appearance of his vessel. Mr, Provost was one of those men whose greatest pride is his ship, and as he gazed aloft with a seaman's fond gaze at her tapering spars, he could not avoid show- iag in his countenance the satisfaction he felt, t ih n e ell merited compliment. He invited iu new friend to walk forward, showed him   every part of the ship and was much pleased at the interest the fictitious Lord Peterbo- rough showed in everything appertaining to its defence; and in this manner, Roderlgo, without creating a suspicion, contrived to learn all he. wished relative to the strength of the cruiser. Commodore Smith now joined them, handing Roberto the despatches for England: "and this," said he, giving him a sealed packet, " you will oblige me much ii you will have the kindness to hand to Capt. Thompson of the frigate Brittania, for I think it not unlikely you may meet with him as he was to remain sometime longer to watch the coast. .It is merely the information you have so kindly communicated to me respect- ing the Meteor, and an order for Capt. Thomp- son, to join me off St. Domingo."' Roderigo assured him that he would im- prove the first opportunity to place the pack- ages in the hands of the persons to. whom they were addressed. Commodore Smith apologizing for his remissness, desired his friend to walk into the cabin and take a glass of wine with ihim. Reappearing on deck, Roderigo was surprised to see the yards of the frigate manned and a detachment of ma- rines opened to the right and left from the cabin door to the gangway, forming a passage for him as they stood with present arms in salute as he passed to the side; and on seat- ing himself in the stern slbeets of his boat, the Commodore and officers raised their caps and bade him adieu. The commander of the Meteor gracefully bowed his acknowledg- ments. as his boat shoved off from the ship whose crew, from the thickly crowded yards, gave him three cheers. . The Isabella now made all sail and stood away south by west under a crowd of canvas; while the Meteor, as soon as Roderigo regained her decks, con- tinued her former course to the northward. During his commander's absence, Roberto had not been idle, but with his glass had at- tentively watched every movement on the decks of the frigate. He had not been un- mindful of the stepping aside of the Commo- dore to converse with his Lieutenant, nor of the glances which they had directed towards the Meteor-; and when he saw the latter hast- ily quit the quarter deck and Witnessed the subsequent mustering of thei men at the guns, he gave orders for a similar mustering in his own barque, but in a less marked man- ner, distributing to them cutlasses and board- ing pistols, which they secured to their per- sons as they crept about the decks, complete- ly secured from observation. Roberto con tinued, however, to keep his distance front the frigate, carleilly watching every move- ment of his c^-zander; when he saw Ro derigo put his haai to his )ocket his heaim beat in quick pul,;.".u, and but for his ac- companying ease and quiet manner he would have approached the ship nearer. This, however, it was fortunate he did not do, as it would have subjected his decks to the scru- - tinizing eye of Mr. Provost, who would hard- ly have failed to discox er the movement of his men. Roderigo toe, though apparently     at perfect base, coln not avoid inwardly feel- h ing the pril to which, he had exposed him-  self; but he was not a man to be daunted by f the appearance of danger, and having made t his plans beforehand, was prepared to act in  any emergency. He had accomplished his a object in visiting the Isabella-more than ac- i oomtlishel it, for while he only thought, to  get her out of his way by sending her on a . wrong scent, and( at the same time gain in-  formation of the Canso, he had become -ac- quainted with her entire means of defence and had also been entrusted with despatches tor England and letters for the commander of the Britannia, which could not fail to be of service to him in case he should fall. in (which was not unlikely) with the latter ves- sel; besides that, the fact-of his being the bearer of these despatches from Commodore Smith would serve to dispel any suspicion which might arise' in the mind of Capt. Thompson. Roderigo well knowing the Isa- bella, as in fact he did every British Cruiser then in commission, could easily have avoid- ed her; his own vessel outsailing all in the service except the Fredoaia, and this excep- tion he did not mean should last long. But we have shown his anxiety to hear something of the Canso, and his desire to overhaul her-and thinking, without doubt, that the frigate had seen her, he determined to brave all danger and ascertain the fact; besides he well knew the character of her commander and flattered himself he could easily-as the result has proved-deceive him. In earlier life he had been a near neighbor and intimate acquaintance of young Lord Peterborough, had often heard his friend speak of Commodore, then Lieutenant, Smith's visits, and had himself been admit- ted in some of their sporting frolics; and in the matter of old Mameluke-though not riding with him at the time, he had acciden- tally come up just as the Commodore was ta- ken from the water, ant had been a witness of the subsequent fate of the horse. The recollection of these events, as has been seen by the reader, perfectly satisfied Commodore Smith of his identity with Lord Peterbo- rough; but his greatest danger of discovery was with Mr. Provost, a gentleman long ac- quainted with the service and not easily de- ceived-well knowing, as he did, the many arts and stratagems the captain of the Mete- or would resort to; and it was not till some. time after his commander had left them to- gether and he had, (as he mistakingly thought,) skilfully and artfully cross-ques- tioled Roderigo, without his perceiving his object, on many subjects connected with his vessel and his cruise, that he abandoned ais suspicions and became satisfied that he was really in the presence of my Lord P.- Still as he cast his eye along the dark hull of the Meteor and sent a hasty but a seaman's glance aloft at her long tapering spars and yards, he could not entirely prevent his first idea from again making forcible entrance into nis mind; then on the other han :, when he istened to the seem tgly natural aore than   half landsman-like rema,.ks .f Roderigo Ra he spoke of the various a pycndages. of the frigate, the guns and their calibre, the advan- tages of this and that peculiar rig, and nO- ticed the ease and grace of his deportment, and the total absence of all that coarseness oi manner of which one would naturally expect to find some' traces, in the bearing or conver- sation of a seaman so long and so exclusive- ly associated with such a band of desperadoes as was believed to. be the crew of the Meteor -in fact, when, he saw before him such a specimen. of the perfect gentleman, which he knew by report Lord Peterborough had the reputation of ,being, all doubts disappeared and the demon of suspicion was again ban- ished from his mind. In this manner, doubt of, and perfect confidence in, the pretensions of Roderigo alternately swayed his mind; ,till on his leaving the ship, Mr. Provost had come to the conclusion that he was no other than the real, long-tried friend of Commodore Smith. CHAPTER IV. The commander of the Meteor after regain- ing his vessel and engaging in some conver- sation with Roberto relative to his visit to the Isabella,* and the course he wished the Meteor to pursue, with folded arms and thoughtful, abstracted manner, paced the quarter-deck in silence: His mind was filled with doubts and fearful forebodings for the safety of the Canso and the lovely Eliza- beth. ie knew Capt. Scott to be an able and -experienced navigator, but from the sudden- ness of the tempest and its extreme violence, he Was led to fear the most gloomy results. He thought not of gold, though that was sup posed to be the object of his pursuit, but of the dear girl who had obtained complete mas- s tery of his heart. Perhaps she was now qui- e etly sleeping in the coral recesses of the sea, or it rnight be with uplifted eyes and bended - knee wasimploring aid from above to save -her from the devouring element, or perhaps, some monster of the deep, with reeking teeth, - was devouring her mutilated remains-the -thought maddened his brain. He hastily y turned to Roberto and bade him send to the - fore-main and royal mast heads two of the e. sharpest look-outs of his crew, adding " tell - them, Roberto, not to let the slightest speck y escape their observation," and turning on ;- his heel, again resumed his meditative walk. g  "And yet, what advantage will i' be to h me," said he, talking to himself, "if I do d again meet her?  She will no longer deem e me worthy a place in her thoughts when she -finds Alphonso to be the dreaded, hunted Ro- ll derigo; and how can I expect that she could s ever love me as I love her? outlaw as I am d -a price fixed upon my head-.and destined ;t as I may be to grace seme ignominious scaf o fold! Well ' at all events I may have the ie - sweet satisfaction of saving her from the bun- n gry jaws of the sea, placing her in safety oe   sr#te, and being i e at I by a sweet smile. t Ifeavens! what wou d'I not dare, to be once  tore blessed with a smile of pleasure from  those heavenly eyes"-- and his heart throb-  sed with delightt as he imagined himself again in the presence of that fair and ange- I lic girl, listening to her thanks as she poured n them forth frim her inmost soul, for her res-  cue from a watery grave; and giving loose  to imagination's reins, he fancied himself  again the hearer of these silvery tones, the c fortunate and delighted object on which rest-  ed those soul-transporting glances; and as he  thought he held that delicate, trembling hand m his own impassioned grasp, his whole soul illed with ecstacy, and his heart was ready to burst with its pent-up delirium of happi- ness. In this extreme abstraction and indeed to- ta 'forgetfulness of everything around him, he was on the point of throwing himself on his knees and pouring out his whole soul to the object of his heart's devotion, when a sea striking the quarter and throwing high its spray over the taffrail, completely saturated his clothes and as suddenly recalled his wan- dering senses. "The d-vil, saf id he, with a burning cheek as he threw a hasty glance around ard his eyes fell on those of Roberto, fixed upoa ; him as- if half-doubting the sanity of his friend and commander. "Ha! ha! ha!" said Robertom " why, Roderigo, one would think you were brought up to the stage-such gestures and attitudes would do honor to any Shakesperian hero. Santa Maria! but I thought you would have jumped into the sea," provokingly continued Roberto, as he presumed on the friendship and intimacy that had existed between him- self and commander for a long-period, " did you take thatdolphin thatsportively gambols on the Weather-quarters to be a goddess, that you should thus pour out your soul through your eyes at her? Look, Roderigo, see how you have frightened the' poor creature as she is swiftly making sail for her coral home to render jealous some lover as she imparts to his agonized heart the dread tale ef passion." '^Spare me, Roberto, I was thinking-the fact is I was-dreaming cf some; fair lady, Boderigo." Well, you may thank me for keeping the eyes of the crew from the exhibition," said his Lieutenant. "Thank you, Robarto, I was musing on a fair and distant friend, and some time or other I will make you acquainted with her history and my own long promised one too. In the mear time, let us work up lar reckon- ing aiJ is - where we are ;" the two officers descend ld o the cabin to pour over their charts and figures "I should think, Roberto," said his com. panion, when they had finished their work, that the Canso could not be fax off, unless indeed -,-and he shuddered at the thought,   thinkl stood. rather m e than an even chance of living through it."  It would not be tne first hurricane that Capt. Scott has weathered," reurned Roderi, go, " but this came on in tl night and he might have been below, and do not think much of the seamanship of hi first late - he is a rash, headstrong fellow and knows but little of these storms, and is so opiniona- ted that he would disdain to take the advice of an inferior-were it not oIb this fault, I should' have less fears for their safety, for old Marline Spike, one of his crew, is a thorough-going sailor and can smell a gale a dozen leagues off. God grant that the old salt was on deck before the tempest came on,' he added very fervently, as he mentally sent up a prayer for their protection. "On deck there! shouted the man at the main-royal-mast-head. , "Hollaol" quickly replied Rolerigo, who' at the instant of the hail had started to his feet and almost as quick as thought reached the quarter-deck. "I see a dark speck in the water. on the lee-cuarter, that looks like a wreck." "Stand by to go about," shouted Roderigo with an energy that astonished the. crew, who flew to their posts with unwonted alert- ness. "Hard lee, let go and haul," contin- ued he, withl an excited and hurried manner, as the Meteor came up with the wind and then. flew. off on the other tack. "Give her  a little pull on the weather-braces, and ease off a trifle main and jib-sheets," as he took the wheel himself and headed the schooner (for she had again changed her rig) about west-north-west. We will now take the reader under our wing, and with rapid flight, land him on the deck of te. Canso as she lay rolling in the trough of the sea, with all sail set, and not wind enough to keep her steady. The air was so close and sultry that Elizabeth and' her father had remained on deck till a late hour in the evening, and long after Captain Scott had retired, "What do think ,of the weather?" said Count Moutmorency, addressing Mr. Wilful, the first mate. "Well, I can't exactly say, sir," answered he, casting a look around the horizon, "but 1 should think we may have some rain to-night and perhaps a little breeze from the westward by morning." "Don't you think, sir, thai this heavy roU r setting in from the north-west rather indicates * a blow from that quarter?" "It may do sa, rir," replied Mr. Wilful- "but the cluuds ioo tsfo wet for much of a i blow." ( Come, my ;t:c,'" said the Count to his daughter, who was leaning on his arm- "Let us retire to ou* cabins. This night air is not good for either of us," and bidding the s Mate good night they went below, and retied ,.to their     the quarter deck, old Marline Spike came aft t and addressing the Mate, said-  "Them ere clouds look kinder dirty and  squally like, sir, and don't you think we had g better take in some of the light sails and get  ready for hinm'?"            I "You7ll wait till I order you."   t "You'll excuse me for being so bold, Mr.  Wilful, but I've sailed in these seas off and I an these twenty year, and encountered many )f them fellers that lay so dead-like just  afore they begin their gambols; and take my word for it, we shall have the fellers aboard as, nor a half hour." "Go forward, sir, and keep your advice till called for," and the seaman, muttering some- thing about d--d headstrong, was prepar- ing to obey the order, when he was brought to tv Y What's that you're muttering, sir?" from Mr. Wilful. "I was saying, sir, that them spars ain't over and above strong,": replied Marline, as he went forward and stationed himself at the starboard fore rigging, axe in hand, well knowing that he should soon have occasion to use it. Elizabeth had withdrawn to her berth, but not to sleep. Her thoughts wandered back to the scene at the Governor's house, and, the delightful tete-a-tete she had enjoyed with Alphonso, listening with rapture to his ani- mating remarks-gazing with delight on his manly and expressive countenance, lit up as it was with the holy and pure bliss'that filled his soul, and giving him, ere she was aware, her heart's fondest affections; and as he arose to leave, suffering him to take her passive hand in his and press it to his heart-while, with a half-chiding, half-consenting man- ner, she hastily withdrew it as he printed a burning riss and slipped upon her tinger a di- amond ring, begging her to wear the bauble is a slight token of his esteem, assuring her that he should know no permanent happiness till they again met, and venturing to hope that she would not, when far distaht, forget her devoted Alphonso. The ring was allow- ed to remain, while she declared that she should look forward to their next meeting with feelings of unmingled pleasure.. Again Alphonso pressed her hand, and warmly thanking her, withdrew. All these scenes rose up rapidly in Eliza- beth's remembrance, filling her soul with both sorrow and delight, as she gazed on the gift, and pictured before her the amiable, hand- some, and accomplished donor. "Forget you, dear Alphonso, no! never, so long as memory retains her throne. But will he continue to think of me? O, yes! he can- not so basely deceive me," and the fair girl cast the unworthy doubt from her mind. She thus continled holding meet communion with her own thoughts, till she was'aroused from her reverie by being thrown with sudden, al- most stunning violence to the cabin floor, while she was deafened by the screams of the tempest as it howled through the rigging, and the skrieks of the seamen as they strugg-led in thb wtPr to the leeward in ;heir vain at-   tempts to regain the'decks of the ship. Ter- rible was the punishment of the Mate for hit rashness in refusing to avail himself of the good seamal 's advice. Obstinately tenacious of his own opinions, he neglected to call the men or permit one stitch of canvas to be taken in,. till the tempest came roaring and bellowing right abeam of them, when, in a hasty, confused, frightened manner, he called all hands on deck just in time to be pitched with every one of them except Marline Spike. into the sea, far distant to leeward, as the ship, with all sail set, received the first shock , of the tempest, and was thrown flat on her side. Marline, forgetting, in his humanity to save a fellow being, the ill-treat- ment he had received from Mr. Wilful, see- ing him struggling in the water threw him a rope, which the poor fellow grasped but im- mediately dropped with a shriek as a huge shark seized him and dragged him below no more to rise. Fortunately Marline Spike had cut the weather lanyards of the main- mast before the tempest reached them, and almost at the'first puff it went by the board, the head sails taking the wind and sheering her off as she was thrown down. Capt. Scott soon succeeded in effecting the release of himself. Count Montmorency and daughter from thwcabin through the sky-light, and as- sisted the Count to lash himself and Elizabeth to the weather-quarter; he, with the seaman, crawled forward and cut away the fore-rig- ging, when the fore-mast snapped and parted just above deck, and the mizzen-mast going by the board at the same instant, the Canso rose to an even keel almost half full of water. The pumps were now rigged and Count Montmorency and Marline Spike labbred hard at. them, relieved ever and anon by Capt. Scott, who, when not at the brakes, stationed himself at the helm. Of twenty-four souls on board the Canso at the commencement of the gale, only these four remained alive. Af- ter unwearied exertions of the two gentlemen and the seaman, they reduced the water in the hold to two feet, and being completely ex- hausted were forced to give up to regain strength. Elizabeth, freeing herself from her lashings, declared her determination to do her share of labor, and seizing the brake, worked with an energy that astonished her beholders; but her father seeing that she too was fast becoming exhausted insisted upon seating her on the quarter-deck. Capt. Scot - giving the helm to the Count directed him to keep the vessel as she was then heading; while he and Marline went forward and got I in board the jib and flying-jib-booms which they lashed to the stuml of thefore-mast, in- 1 tending to set', me sail on them as soon as - the gale should lull sufficiently. The storm I spirit with all his wild crew still ruled ovel i them, howling and raging frightfully, as the sea, iashed, into fury, raised high its foam- capped heads which fell tumultuously around  e them, threatening them at every instant with d destruction. Wherever they gazed, desolation i and death seemed to stare them in the face - Boats,bulwarks, caboose, round-house. every   hing had beet swept from the 3Jcks, and what had been but a short time before the beautiful chip Canso, now lay on the ,later a battered and unsightly wreck. In this manner they continued to scud be- fore the gale for the remainder of the. night, when about day-break they discovered the ship had sprung a leak and that the water was making fast in the hold. Elizabeth now offered again to assist at the pumps, but this being absolutely denied by all, she prevailed  upon them to give her charge o/the helm, Capt. Scou directing her from time to time which way to turn the wheel. Capt.. Scott, the Count, and Miarline, now relieved each Other at the pumps, but their arduous labors apparently gained nothing on the leak, the water seeming to mal-e as fast as they pump- ed it out. x Their situation had now become- dreadful-the wind still blowing fresh, a high sea running, which if they had not lost their boats, would make them almost useless, the ship leaking fast without any hope of stop- ping it, and themselves almost worn out with excessive labor and fatigue. In this hour of despair and misery, Elizabeth proposed that each of them, still remaini ng at their stations, should offer a prayer to th: throne of mercy obr aid in their perilous and forlorn condi- tion. At the moment, the sun, tearing asun- der the black veil of clouds, shone out mildly and encouragingly upon them as if their Heavenly Father had already heard their prayers and was stretching forth His mighty arm to save them. Taking courage from the happy omen, they redoubled their exer.- tions at the pumps. Marline Spike at this instant appeared on deck with the joyful news that he had got at one of the leaks and stopt it. They now si- lently breathed their heartfelt thanks to God for His mercy, and with almost sulperhuman strength plied themselves industriously at 'the brakes; but the water gained rapidly on them when they paused but for an instant to take breath. Perfectly exhausted they now quit their labor and threw themselve-s on the 'deck in utter hopelessness. After a few mo- ment's indulgence of this gloomy mood, Capt. Scott sprang to his feet and telling them he would try another expedient, sent the sailor below for a spare topsail, to the low- er part of which they attached bits of deep sea lead and fastening the upper corners with ropes, sunk it under the bowsprit where they had discovered a leak and where the pressure of the water kept it snug to the bottom,of the vessel. This, they had the satisfaction of perceiving, almost entirely prevented the sea fi'om entering the ship. Reappearing on deck they discovered what they supposed to be a vesseLat some distance ahead of them. Capt. Scott took the wheel , and stood direc lyfor the object, which prov- ed to be an East Indiaman, bottom up,'with some fifty uhfortunate wretches clinging to it  and almost as many more struggling in the water around then. The Captain ran the Canso as near as possible alongside the wrack while Count Montmorencv and Mar- 2   line stood ready, with lines in hand. in the vain hope of saving some of .he wretched be- ings from what appeared a more forlorn situ- ation than their own. Nearing the wreck the most heart-rending cries fcr succor fell upon their ears-     , "Oh God! my child! save my child l shrieked a poor woman, who for a moment relinquishing her grasp of a curly-pated bov, of some four years, in order more firmly to secure a hold for both, saw' a wave dash him from her and carry him, upborne on its crvst, towards the Canso, which vessel was to I e- ward. Marline Spike having secured ,ne end of a rope around his waist and 'the ovaet on board, bidding the Count lo?k out foi it, plunged into the sea, his brawny chest tnd muscular arms dashing aside the water, as with the speed of an expert swimmer, he overtook the child and safely brought himon deck. The poor mother, seeing her child safe, with " my God, I thank thee," on hex lips, was the next instant swept from hei hold by a sea and lost to their sight. Notwithstanding their utmost exertions they could not sa;,e another soul, and not be- ing in a condition to enable them to heave to, they were forced to leave them in their deplorable condition. Had they succeeded, however, in their work of humanity, they very much feared it would only have been the means of prolonging their fate for a few holn ,s for the water was now above the cab in floor of the Canso. It is true they had partially stopped the .leaks, but then they were so exhausted that they could not avail themselves of this advantage; neither was it probable that, had they rescued those un fortunate beings, they could have been of an) assistance, worn out, as they were, with the continual breaking over them of a heavy sea still it was painful in the extreme to' b obliged to leave their fellbw-creatures in such imminent, nay, certain danger without having the power in anywise to assist them. Their attention was now drawn to the little fellow whom Marline had saved though in a senseless state. Beginning to revive, he sobbed most piteously for his mamma. Eli- zabeth, taking the little fellow, finally suc- ceeded in pacifying him, and the dark clouds of sorrow, which had shadowed his face,' soon passed away, like a summer's cloud, leaving all that is bright and fair behind it. He was indeed beautiful; a forehead high, full and clear as alabaster-eyes, whose rich- iess and dark brilliancy might mark him a child of the East-full, yet delicately round- ed, cheeks on which the damask and ivory beautifully intermingled-a dimpled, laugh- ter-loving chin-lips, the " ruby rhetoric" of whose smile won its instant way to the heart -and a head completely covered with heavy - clusters of bright auburn ringlets. Such was' I this lovely boy Elizabeth seated him in her t lap and in her kind and winning manner an- ' swered his various questions; and at times he would ask in a mournful tone for his e namma, she told him that his mother slept - beneath the cold wave, and that he must caiJ1 I ner mamma.     Their attention' was now called to their g 3wn distressing situation; the water, was t fast r' ing in the hold and the ship settling t (as it seemed to their agonized minds) with  fearfit. rapidity; beside the day was draw- d ing to a close and they had no boats, nor in- I deed any thing from which they might con- r struct a raft.             I "O God! this is too horible," said Count Montmorency to his daughter, "to see you s in the prime of life, when everything looks ] bright and joyous, doomed thus to die an aw- X ful death! would to God, my dearest chill, d my own life could save thine! most willing-  y would I bow my head to the messenger of death could I, by so doing, secure thy. safety, X blest image of my departed Isabell!" Elizabeth threw herself into the arms of her fond parent, a parent she almost adored,  and sobbed in silence--then lifting her stream- ing eyes to his, she kissed away the manly tears as they coursed down his furrowed cheek. '"Dearest father," she said, "be comfort- ,ed.; it is some hours yet ere it will be dark, ,and in the meantime God in His mercy may -stretch forth his mighty arm and save us, ;but should He order it otherwise, and doom us to die, His will be done! Thine ownfond child will be with thee, her spirit. will take its departure with thine, and"-here she was interrupted by old Marline Spike who had been a spectator of the scene, and for some time busily and with a child-like fretfulness working away at his eyes, trying, as he said, to keep the wind from making them leak so, though he seemed to forget that' he was standing with his back to the breeze; and bringing, his heel sharply down to efface a tear which had dodged his fingers, coursed his weather-beaten features, and fell plump on deck--"Lord bless your angelic looking face, ma'am. don't take on so, for I know God hain't the heart to drown such a kind soul; for I seed, when you axed us all to send a prayer aloft for help, the sun break away at once and smile on you-as much as to say, your flag of distress is seen and I will send you help.' Shiver my timbers, if this wind hadn't made my eyes leak so I should say that was- -Sail ho!" roared the old tar, al- most mad with delight as by dint of hard rubbing he had cleared one eye sufficiently  to distinguish a sail making directly for them. Marline capered about the decks, abs/.i'tely wild with joy, as he threw high In the air his tarpaulin-and in an instant after, with bended knees and hearts overflow- ing with gratitude, all poured forth their thanks to God for His mercy in sending diem relief. CHAPTER V. Mercifu. God, it is she! See, she waves her scarffor aid," said Roderigo, as trem- bling in, every limb with extreme emotion he came wrll nigh dropping into the sea hi.   glass, through which he Lad been leconno tering the wreck. "Fly Roberto,. fire a gun to windward to let the poor souls know we see them." Almost at the instant of the or- der being given the thick wreaths of smoke rolled over the decks of the Meteor, and the report of her gun fell gratefully on the ear of those on board the Canso. "See! they have raised, a board with something written on it. My God! what do I read? ' Haste we sink,' almost gaspingly murmured Roderigo, as the glass fell to the deck. "Clap on stern sails, low and aloft, and every stich of canvas we can muster." In a few moments the Meteor shot through, or rather flew over, the water like a thing of life. "Give them another gun, Roberto, to. en- courage them, for with God's permission we willsoon be up with them. Bless me, what's the matter with the old Meteor, she hardly moves!" said the impatient commander, as his vessel was throwing the spray high' in the air and flying with the speed of thought -"Why, Roberto, this won't do, we must run her into a harbor and overhaul her, she must be foul to sail so slow; why the poor creatures will sink before our eyes. Send aft thirty men, Roberto, to man the boats and bid them be lively, for I see the wreck appears to be settling in the water." In a trice, three boats were manned and the fourth ready to be launched. 'The Me- teor was now close alongside the Canso, ant running under her stern ;.Roderigo put the helm down, when she came up with the win' and lay to at a convenient but safe distance to leeward of the fast sinking wreck; then springing into the first boat at hand, he bade the others pull off and make for the ship with all possible despatch. "Now my lads," ad dressing his own. boat's crew, "if you love  Iyour commander, pull with a will," and the men bent to their task with herculean strength. They were now about a half cable's distance from the wreck, and Roderigo, see- ,ing her give that dull, heavy, fatal roll, which he knew  immediately precedes the final plunge, standing up in the stern sheets of the "boat, exclaimed: "My God! they are sinking from under our very hands-pu., my brave lads, and be- ,' fore another sun set I1ll make grandees of * every mother's sun of ye!" then hailing the wrack, bade them, in God's name, jumr into the sea. All hands on board the. Canso heard his hail except Elizabeth, who stood on the taff- rail apparently in the act of jumping, yet stupefied and rooted to the spot. Roderigo groaned aloud as he saw the fair girl-thus un- decided, knowing that in a moment tnoe aL that was left of the ship -must sink, and with it his heart's most cherished idol, A; the same. moment a deep moan seemed to come Iror every timber of the Canso, as she rose s on the top of a sea, where, as if dreading the fatal instant,'she seemed to be stationary-- , then suddenly plunging bows under, disap- s peared beneath the water. Roderigo'. bow   had struck the side of the wreck as she was moD riding with the sea for the last time, andwith  i a oe bound springing on the qiarter-deck as che he boat fill astern, he rushed to the stupi by tled girl, who, turning at the moment and  seeing him at her side, shrieke : "Alphon- ous  so it and fell senseless in his arms. Roder- ing go, supporting his precious charge, was in ma an instant struggling with almost superhu- oth man effort. against the current caused by the S sinking ship, and which, though opposing boy with all his strength, seemed hurrying him El to that awful vortex, which having once en-  tered no human aid. could longer avail. The boat's crew hesitated but for a moment; ert though they well knew the mighty pourer of he that fearful and rapid whirlpool, still with a n noble daring and brave resolve, they deter- mined to rescue their commander and his  'ovely prize, or pe:ish in the attempt They be were in the current, and steering directly for cr Roderigo soon had him and. the half inani- m mate form of Elizabeth in the boat. Roder- h ig6 was about to take the helm himself,when t perceiving old Spike in charge, bade him st keep her head to the stream, and taking an g oar' himself, said to the men.     be "Be lively now, my hearties, or we shall  all soon be in Davy Jcnes's locker."  d The boat they were in was long, narrow, a clipper-built, copper-fastened, and coppered h to the bends, and at this time fully manned, having out on a side seven oars--still, not- r withstanding their utmost exertions they a seemed, if not going astern,stationary; and all hunlan effort appeared of no avail. The  mighty current with its fearful force threat- en J soon to overpower them, and the strength I of the men could not bear up against such c odds. Roberto now, with,the other two boats secured to his by a line, approached as near  Roderigo as he could without entering the I m'ore rapid part of the current; the men in the three boats backing water and being all ready to pull ahead the moment the word was given. When about thirty feet distant,  Roberto stood in the stern sheets of his boat and threw a line which fortunately the star- bow oarsman caught and made fast to the ring in the bow of Roderigo's boat. '"Pull away now, my lads," shouted Ro- berto, and the three boat's crews, with those of Roderigo, pulled for their lives, and in a - few moments had the satisfaction of seeing the;r efforts crowned with success; by their cormmander's boat moving steadily ahead a foot or two farther, they would be safe. Ro- derigo, who had exchanged places with old 'Spiaes, having, been intently watching the line, now observed that it had sprung, and as the rope snapped asunder and fell into the water, he' shouted to the men--" now my boys, one strong pull for yo r lives!" Sum- moiing all their remaining strength for one last, mighty effort, they bent to their oars and gave a p I which would almost have cap- sized a mhuntain, and as it was snapped every oar, shnding the men on their backs to the bottom of the boat, and tie boat herself hi length clear of all danger, This uncer-.   monious tumble did not pre rent them abo. giving three cheers at their escape,. which cheer was at the same moment responded to by the other boats, and also, by the men on board of the schooner, who had been anxi- ously watching the struggle. The boat be- ing again supplied with--oars, all hands made for the M;eteor, Roberto's crew with the others having succeeded in picking up Capt. Scott, Count Montmorency, Marline and the boy. Roderigo now turned his attention to Elizabeth, who had been lying during all this time on the cushions, perfectly unconsci- ous of all around her. By dint of great ex- ertions and applying powerful stimulants to her nostrils, she so far recovered as to recog nize in Roderigo her friend Alphonso. 'Oh! where am I, Alphonso? am I still dreaming or is it dread reality I remem- ber something of a sinking ship and confused cries bldding me leap into the sea, and then methought I saw the waves with uplifted heads about falling on me-and then my fa- ther--ha! ;where is he?" cried she, with startling energy, a returning consciousness gradually brought to mind the sight of her beloved parent struggling in the water; "he I is not here," continued she, "say, Alphonso, did my father perish? and were you so cruel as to save te only to make me wretched for i his loss?" Roderigo assured her that Count Mon morency was safe and that soon she wouL. y again be clasped in his arms. "May the God of all mercies bless and crown you with everlasting happiness, Al- phonso, for you have indeed relieved my h mind of a. orld of wretchedness-may you h ' always be as happy as you could wish!?' ts  Taking her willing hand and pressing it ir ardently to his heart, he told her he was never \e .more happy than then, and the thought that in he had been instrumental in saving her life Ill and in promoting her comfort, would never rd fail to be a source of the highest gratification t, to him. He then added that ever since the at storm came on he ha felt the greatest anxie- r- ty for her safety-that that very morning he he had spoken the Isabella who reported that they had been in company with the Canso o- just before the gale and that he had, imme- )se diately after leaving her, sailed in quest of a -them-that no words could convey the ex- ng tent of his anxiety when he first discovered eir the wreck, or his unbounded joy at the sight a of herself as she waved the scarf to him- lo-, that his vessel, notwithstanding she was cov- old ered with canvas and had the reputation of the I being a very fast sailer, seemed to him never as to have moved so slowly-and thathis impa- the tience to b:e with her and give her aid, al- my most induced him to quit her and take to his im-. boats. He assured her also that if he had one not succeeded in saving her, he should never and' more have had a moment's hal piness, and that' ap- when. he saw her perilous situation, standing ped alone and apparently stupified on the quarter- s to deck of the fast sinking ship, he determined rself if her rescue were possible to effect it at all er.-- hazards,     Elitabeth replied that words could never express the thous;andth part of her gratitude for his generous exertions, but that her heart woJld, to its latest, dying pulse, bear in grate- ful remembrance his kindness to her and hers aud as she spoke, with eyes mildly and sweet- ly rivetted on his, her countenance was lit up by all the noble emotions of her soul, while she assured him that next to her fath- er, he should be dear to her. Roderigo pressed her hand, still retained in his own, and replied that he was more than doubly re- warded for the little risk he had run, and thanked God that he had at least one friend who, whatever might be his fate, would at least think kindly of him when he should be no more. Elizabeth, as if some new and troubled thought had just come into her mind, was about to speak; but Roderigo, who noticed it, and guessed at the. idea, suddenly hailed the boats, and ordered Roberto to show his passengers to the cabin as soon as he boarded the schooner. The last boat of the three ha- just dropped astern of the gang- way-the survivors of the Canso having got on board and desceded to the cabin, when Roderigo touched the side of the Meteor. In a few moments Elizabeth reached the deck, and leaning on the arm of her friend, was shown into a side cabin richly curtained and ornamented with mahogany and satin wood, the floor covered with the finest Brus- sels. On one side of the cabin stood a piano and harp, by which:, in the corner, leaned a  guitar--on the opposite side, a handsome and well-stocked library-at the farther end, andi covering the whole surface of the side wall, ( with the exception of a space occupied by a 1 sofa, was a full length mirror surrounded by t a rich frame, while from the ceiling hung. a superbly wrought chandelier.. Next to the  piano was a small door opening into a dress- s ing room well supplied with female wearing c apparel of the richest material. Adjoining f this, was the sleeping apartment assigned to I the ladies, when any were on board-the  whole suite of rooms fitted up in a style of f Eastern magnificence; that first mentioned a being occupied exclusively by Roderigo in t his hours of leisure, either to beguile the time d with music or reading, of both which em- t ploymelits he was extravagantly fond. Into r this apartment, as we have said, he now con- h ducted Elizabeth, and leading her to the sofa, apologized for the total absence of all feimale s domestics on board to assist her in her toilet, but begged her to appropriate any of the nu- merous dresses with which the wardrobe was afled, and make herself as comfortable as a possible in her present situation; then stir- sl ring up the fire with which the stove had been provided, he was about taking his leave, bi when a knock at the door was heard, and o0 upon Roderigo's summons to come in, was al opened by a youth officiating as page to the p( eommander, bearing on a chased-gold waiter w a 'cup of the same rich material, containing ai a hot wine sangaiee, which, before leaving E is the boat, Roderigo had ordered Gonzala, hi dt page, to prepare for the lady. The youth re   er seemed about ten years; rather tall for his 'e age, of slender, graceful form, with a pale. rt but expressive countenance, and features :- somewhat of the Grecian order, regular and ; handsome. His jet black eyes were shaded - by delicately formed eyelashes, while his t black hair hung in clustering curls about his I, head.. le- was in a naval undress uniform - of white pants, white silk hose and pumps- ) white vest with bright buttons, and a closely , fitting blue cloth short jacket with standing - collar, to either side of which was attached i an anchor of gold lace. The buttons were I impressed with an eagle and a single'star. t One row of these ascended ki front to the e throat, and four of them, singly, lined the .ap- l pets of the pockets on each side the jacket, r which was secured only by the three lower buttons an I thrown open in the bosom, dis playing a tine linen shirt, closed at the neck by a simple black ribbon. Carrying in one hand a small blue cloth  cap, surrounded, like his master's, with a gold band, and in the other the waiter, Gon- zala approached Elizabeth and was about presenting the wine, when Roderigo himselx handed it and begged her to drink it whi. hot, telling her she would need it to preven! taking cold after so long exposure in her wet clothes. -He then pointed to a door leading to a recess where she would find a marble 'bath prepared with warm water, and again begging her to use freely everything wilh which the apartments were provided, handed her the key of the outer door, told her to lock' it upon the inside, and should she be in want of anything to touch the bell and he would himself obey the summons.  Elizab-th thanked him for his kindness, said she would hastily despatch her toilet, and in her presen destitute condition would gladly avail her- self of some of the wearing apparel he had offered her, and requested him to assure her father she was well and would soon join him. Roderigo left the room, taking with- him Gonzala, and entering the general cabin found the other survivors had been carefully attendfd to by Roberto, and that each of them had been provided with a change of dress from the ample wardrobe on board. At the door he was met by the Count Montmo-. rency, who advanced with open and extended hand, and, grasping Roderigo's, said- "The commander of the Meteor, I pre sume?" Roderigo bowell. "' My daughter, sir?" continued the Count "She is safe, and in the next cabin, makin! a dry toilet, and desired me to say to you'thav she was quite well, and would soon meet you.' At this moment the page entered with a billet, which he handed to his master, who, opening it, read --' We passed a wreck about two or three hours sincei with fifty poor wretches clinging to it. Captain Scott will tell you where to find them-if you have any regard for me, you will search for them. Elizabeth." Roderigo slipped the paper ix his bosom, and, addressing C'unt Moniam rency, said-   The billst was front your daughter, who mentions having seen a wreck, ar, wishes me to search for it, referring me to Captain Scott for its direction." "May a father's blessing rest upon you, Roderigo," said the Count, for the aid you have this day afforded us-and which has completely banished from my heart those un- :nst suspicions I had entertained of your (ha acter from nev spaper exaggerations. I trust, sir, I may have it in my power one day to show my gratitude in a more substan- tial manner. than by words," and, giving him his address, begged that if he should ever be in London he would let him know it., and nothing -but sickness' or death should prevent his attendance on him. Roderigo, taking the card, assured him that in his heart he was alreadyv more than rewarded for the little service he had done' them, and that should he ever have it in his power to visit them, he would certainly avail himself of the kind invitation,. Then turning to Capt. Scott: "Ah! my friend, Capt. Scott, I am very happy to see you, though I am truly sorry for your loss. But never mind, sir---keep up a gocd heart, it might have been worse.- Beside, sir, you know my loss is something, for I understand my friend George, having sent me a remittance and not finding me, or- dered it. to. be returned by the Canso-but never mind-this wreck that, you passed-- where away is it?" (apt. Scott having thanked him for his generous and successful exertions ir saving them from a watery grave, gave him the di- rer lion -the wreck lay from them, the time tneyhad left them, &c. Roderigo, excusing himself, begged his passengers to keep as comfortable as possible until he could find time to look after them, which he promised ne would do as soon as he had given a search for the poor fellows on the Indiamian. CHAPTER   VI. Ascending, then, the quarter-deck, Roderi- go gave orders for the schooner to fill away, and giviqg the man at the- wheel his direc- tions as to what course to steer, requested Roberto to send a man to the fore-royal-mast hea- * and tell him, Roberto, to keep a sharp look-out for everything, especially a wreck which I expect to fall in with on this course; and being now as he supposed in its vicinity, he remaiied himself on 'the quarter-deck in hope to espy the object of his sea/h. 'While thus employed, he could not avoid feeling and 'exhibiting an elasticity of spirits quite un- common for him,- and which was doubtless owing to his having rescued from a watery grave the being he so dearly cherished, and feeling that her blest presence was so near him. -But then he feared that it would be almost an impossibility to obtain an inter- view with her, unattended by her father, though like a true Id ver, he did not despair.   "' But what shall I do with these people," he continued, in communion with his own thoughts. "Count Montmorency  will ol course feel desirous to be landed with Eliza- beth as soon as possible, or to be put on board the first British- vessel we meet; and we may perhaps fall in with some such chance in a few hours, though God grant the tume be ho. so near! Yet why should I wish to deprive Elizabeth of her liberty? She must nave discovered my disguise, or at least suspects something wrong. And can she, will she love me, when she finds that I am that out- law made by report so terrible? 'that outlaw, for whose head a weak and silly government have set so high a price, because, forsooth, I would make them pay for the great injustice they have done me? Alas! if she could, I cannot think to tear her from her friends and the comforts of home, to cruise on the wild and tempestuous. ocean, exposed to the dan- gers of the elements as well as to the fury o' my enemies. No! no! even if she were willing to bear me company, I would not thus expose her to suffering and misery." - He was aroused from his soliloquy by the cry from aloft-"On deck, there!" "1Hallo!'J replied Roderigo.  "I see a wreck, sir, a sad wreck, about a mile distant, and think I can see something clinging to her bottom." Roberto went forward with the glass, and quickly returning, reported to his command- er that there was a gentleman, in naval uni form, clinging to the wreck: "And he ap- pears to see us," added he, "for he raised -one arm, and tried to swing it round in the air, but it immediately fell, from weakness." "Give him a gun, Roberto, to let him know we see him, and stand by to lower awayr the boat." ; Roderigo seized the glass, to view the ef- fect the report would have on the unfortu- nate being, and, as it went booming toward him, he saw him suddenly turn his head to the Meteor, then let it fall, and cover his face with his hands, as if overpowered with emo- tions too great for the weakness of his-frame. The Meteor, under the influence of all her canvas, was now rapidly approaching the wreck, when Roderigo heard the bell from Elizabeth's cabin ring. He hastened imme- diately to the door, and gently tapping, asked her pleasure. Elizabeth opened it and ap- proached before him, clad in the. simplest dress she could find in the wardrobe-an Inr dia-wrought muslin, purely white, with a broad mantle of the same. reaching to her neatly slippered foot, while her hair hung in its natural ringlets round hei face, from which every shade of care was banished. "I am rejoiced to see you so well after your perilous adventure-why, my, deal friend, that dress looks as if it were intended expressly for you"-(and indeed Roderigo had purchased it at great expense at King- ston, intending to have presented it in case of overhauling the Canso) " you never look- ed more rovely-positively I must land yov somewhere soon, or no er let you snow y At.     self tAm leck, for my men would 'be struck blind with gazing on so much brightness." "Have done, Alphonso, or I shall think you are a flatterer. I wished to say to you that I was ready and anxious to see-my fa- ther, and also to inquire of you why that gun was fired!" "It is to give notice to a poor fellow on that wreck you wished me to search for and which . have found." El'za)eth, clasping her hands with strong emotion, said, " from my heart I thank you, Alphonso, for ihis additional act of kindness to me," and she accompanied her words with a,:h a look of grateful aftection that Roderi-  to fancied he had quit earth for heaven. "Dear Elizabeth," said he, " what would I not do for you to be rewarded by such an expression of kind esteem--esteem for one, too, whom all the world-but you rang? oh! I remember, allow me to conduct your honor- ed father to you." "But Alphonso, before you leave for that purpose, tell me, why did you not finish that sentence about ' all the world'? Shall I fin- ish it for you and say, esteem for one whom all the world else, fears?" "How! Elizabeth, do you then know me? and can you indulge a kind. feeling for the hunted, traduced, vilifiej, outlawed, Roderi- g)? I should have added-the unhappy Ro-' derigo, but now no longer unhapy) since I have found one--one too, for whose happiness I would freely pour out my heart's warmest blood-that can look on me with'a thought of kindness." "Yes! Roderigo, I do know you, for when your vessel first came in sight, Capt. Scott recognized you at once and told usIwho you were ; but until your vessel passed close alongside the Canso, I did not know that my --my friend Alphonso (said she., coloring slightly as she checked the expression her heart was about uttering) and the dreaded Roderiga, were one and the same individual." "And can you still, dearest Elizabeth, can you still feel the same interest in the outlaw- ed Roderigo, that I flatter myself you did for Alphonso., and 'may I hope that at some fu- ture day should: I appear before you with this foul blot upon my character effaced, you will deem me worthy your affections and bless me with the acceptance of your hand end heart?" Ah! press me not now, Roderi go-my fa- ther, for whom I feel the most unbounded af- fection, would I fear never consent to such a unicn, and without that consent I could never wed. But look not so sad, for he is very kind to me and loves me much and in all things consults my happiness. But my fa- ther, Roderigo--I am anxious to see him; and the wreck too-I am keeping you from saving those poor wretches from a watery grave." Feeling the importance of attending to these matters, he hastily kissed her hand and sayingx, " we will renew 'this conversation, learest Elizabeth, at another time.," took his eave and went in search of her pare nt; and   having conducted him to Elizabeth's; cabin, left them for the purpose of giving his atten- tion to the shipwrecked individual, .wl. Dm they had now approached within half pistol shot. Ordering the man at the wheel Qt bring the vessel to, Roderigo himself descend- ed into the boat which had been towing alongside, and directing the men to shove off and let fall, he had in a few moments the satisfaction of rescuing the officer, though in a very weak condition. Forbearing to ask him any questions in his exhausted situation, the commander of the Meteor hastene on board, where he told Roberto to take inarge of the stranger, give him dry clothe 'and nourishment, and provide him a berth at he might be able to recruit himself.  The boats being now hoisted up and se- cured, Roderigo paced the deck in thought- ful mood, revolving the-best course for him to pursue. Should he return, he would with- out doubt fall in with one or both the vessels of war he had previously met with, and the chance of again escaping would be very small. It was true he could easily run away from one of them, (provided she mere discovered in season) and with regard to the other, he judged that she must have been so crippled by his shot and the hurricane, as to make her a foe not much to be dreaded: and even should he be compelled to fight her, he believ- ed that the Meteor would not come out of the engagement second best, for he had almost as many men as the Fredmnia, and each man he well knew could be depend- ed upon. On the other hand should he con- tinue the course he first intended and pro- ceed towards the British Channel, his path would be strewed with danger, though, as an offset, he would probably fall in with some rich prizes, which were never unacceptable. ]But above all, and the thought troubled him more than all others, that should he steer for the Channel, he might very soon fall in with some- homeward-bound vessel, on which Count Montmorency would insist upon being placed with his daughter, and Roderige could not bear the idea of so quickly losing his lovely companion, perhaps forever. While engaged in these perplexing thoughts, and as yet undecided what course to take, he was aroused by Gonzala, who stood at his elbow; cap in hand, and said that Count Montrnmo rency sent his compliments, and if not other- wise engaged would be happy to see him in his daughter's cabin, as he desired tc navo some private conversation with him. When Count M[ontmorency entered ,heA cabin in Nhich Elizabeth was, and to which he had been conducted by Roderigo, his' daughter moved forward and threw herself into his arms, exclaiming, "thank God, my dear father, you are safe," and overpowered  with emotion, buried her face in his bosom, and wept without control. Tenderly embra cing her, and no less affected at seeing her safe from the dangers which butt a little be- fore had surrounded them, he led -Elizabeth to the sofa, and stating nhimse if beide her sai . - '4   U   Yes, my child, you have indeed reason to a thank God for His mercy, in sending this f stranger thus opportunely to our rescue. And v how do you feel, mylove, have you taken any  cold from your exposure?"       r "No, dearest father,- this generous com-  mander by his hospitality has prevented it.  Look. father, around you, and see the many  comforts with which this cabin abounds-- and look here," said she, conducting him tdo the bathing, dressing, and sleeping apart- ments, " this wardrobe too, from which I have, as you perceive, at his request, attired my-  self."  "We do, indeed," replied Count Montmo-  rency, " oye this stranger many thanks for his generosity and kindness; but, my love,  do you know this man?" Elizabeth, at this question, was for an in- stant somewhat confused-but as she wasin-  capable of secet towards any one, most of all toward her 'revered and only parent, she mentioned having met with him at the Go- vernor's house the evening before they sail-  ed, and represented to him Roderigo's de- portment and conversation in such an ani- thated aind interested manner, that Count Montmorency saw at once the state of her heart, and made no other reply than a sigh. "But why look so unhappy, my dear fa- ther?" Ah! my child, I fear that this stranger "as too great a hold on your affections for your happiness, for he is no other than the hunted, outlawed Roderigo and sooner or  later he will be overtaken by the strong arm of the law, and think, Elizabeth, what fate awaits him for the many outrages he has committed!" "I know all, my' dear father, but he has been abused and his conduct misrepresented. lIe speaks of strong injustice done him by our government, for which, he says, he must have redress; and he, never attacks any oth- er than British vessels, anti hen never sheds blood. I acknowledge his conduct does not -appear justifiable, but then he has been driv- en to it; but, father, perhaps you could in- duce him to quit this mode of life, and em- brace some reputable business. Think of his brave forgetfulness of self, and his noble daring in rescuing me from almost certain destruction;-think, had it not been for his 'disinterested courage you would now have been childless, and your daughter sleeping beneath the wave." " Enough, my child! from my soul I thank him for preserving to me the blest image of my sainted Isabella, but I regret that he should have made so deep an impression on your affections; for I fear I shall be unable to make him leave his present lawless course, and in that event I am much concerned for your peace, as surely my daughter would not so far forget herself as to unite her fate -with that of a frcixooter. However, before we quit the vesse, I will try what .effect my ar- guments will have, and if money will tempt him, my fortune will be divided between us, for I ave hint much more than paltry gold   can eve repay. In the meanti rte I must find out from him what he, intends doing with us. I suppose we cannot be far fromn Kingston, and perhaps he will be willing to returnus there; and, on the other hand, I do not know that we ought to ask him to 'do this for us, as he must thereby necessarily expose himself to capture by some of the many cruisers  with which  these seaS abound." "But if we continue in this course," re-  turned Elizabeth, "shall we not be likely in a day or two to fall in with some vessel bound for England, in which we might take passage?"  - "Very probably, my kdear, but I will seek this Roderigo and ascertain, if I can, what are his plans."' With this object Count Montmorency opened the door, 'intending himself to go in search of Roderigo, but seeing Gonzala at hand, he sent him with his compliments to his commander, as we hate before men- tioned. *  *  * .*   *  *, *   .- We left the Fredonia scudding before the wind, with such temporary spars erected as the exigency of the time could aflord, her hullsomewhat cut up by the shots of the Meteor and the falling spars, her guns thrown overboard, and her crew reduced in number about fifty, beside some few wounded. Lord Dash, her commander, felt keenly the treat- ment he had received from the M eteor, while 'his pride was somewhat humbled by the crippled, shattered state of his vessel. He now resolved to make for Kingston to repair damages and refit his vessel, after which he determined to have another brush' with -him provided he had not been captured before- hand by some of the fleet: '" and by my hopes of preferment, if I once fall in with the graceless dog, I'll blow himn and his cursed crew (fine marksmen, though!) to the third heaven,"- said Lord Dash as he paced the quarter-deck, working himself in- to a passion- at the' thought of the Meteor's escape, and the trick that had been played upon him. "But how, in the devil's name, did the fellow smell my disguise so soon? Is would have defied the Lords of the Admi- ralty to have recognized the Fredonia, or any vessel of war, under her clunAy and merchantlian-looking rig! But this Rode- - rigo no sooner gets within spy-glass distance of me than he suddenly shows me his heels. However, if I had had a little more daylight, I should soon have tripped them up. Well, well, I'll have him yet"-then turning to the  fillst Lieutenant, he bade them set up all the spars thev could on the ship, 'and make all possible sail. All :hands were quickly and busily employed in executing these orders: spare topmasts were lashed to the stumps of the masts,-the former- top-gallant and royal. masts were furnished with their appropriate yards and lails; and before night the Fre- donia was making good headway on her course. The next morning at daylight they were close up with the Vi'gin Islands, and     passing 'these without any incident, stood for Jamaica, and arrived at Kingston on the morning of the 21ist June. Lord Dash im- mediately went on shore and repaired to the Governor's house, where he made his report in person, giving a minute account of the disasters which had befallen him, but attri- buting the loss of the greatest portion of his i men who had fallen to the bursting of a cou- ple of guns, and their being washed from the secks when the ship was hove down in the hurricane. The news of the re-appearance of the Me- teor in that quarter caused many of the good inhabitants of Kiangston much uneasiness. The governor, especially, felt great anxiety for the safety of his friend Count Montmo- rency and his charming daughter, knowing, as he did, and also that Roderigo knew, af the specie on board the Canso, and be- lieving that that was the true cause of her presence at this time. But this anxiety was somewhat diminished by the information which he received the next day on the arri- val of the frigate Isabella, whose commander informed him of having spoken with the Canso at a safe distance from the supposed present location of the Meteor, which from the report of Lord Peterborough, whose ves- sel he had also spoken, and who had been chased by the pirate, he had reason to be- lieve was in the vicinity of some of the lee- ward islands. "But," continued Commo- dore Smith," I run in among some of them, and not seeing anything of him, and having met with some damage in the late gale, I concluded to return here and repair." Both vessels were now speedily refitting, with a determination to sail at the earliest possible day, to scour those seas, bays and inlets, and if possible, to ferret out this daring outlaw. CHAPTER VII. Leaving those two frigates to complete their repairs we will again revisit the Me- teor, and accompany Roderigo, as in obe- dience to zhe request of Count Montmorency he is repairing to the ladies' cabin, in which were the Count and his daughter. On his entrance, the former rose from the sofa on which he was seated with Elizabeth, and, xtending his hand to Rodertgo, said, u You will excuse me for sending for you, sir, but supposing you might not wish to see me on deck, and desiring to have some con- versation relative to your views as to our destination, I have taken the liberty to re- qute, your company' here. You muslt be aware, sir, that we know the character of your vessel, and h:ve much anxiety to quit it, not that we apprehend any injury from you; but your crew, sir, composed as it is of all nations and characters, might not be so lenient."  "I pray you, Count Montmorency, and you, Madam, to give yourselves not one mon ment of uneasiness on account of ml crew;   for while I nank ,on sincerely for the cot fI dence you place in me, which shall not be abused, I can also assure you that my men will never offer you the least violence while on board my vessel. It is true they are com- posed of almost all nations, but there is not a man of them who would disobey a word of his I commander, or who would not brave every danger for his sake; beside, sir. we are not the blood-thirsty pirates our enemies report us to be. It is true we burn and sink all Bli tish vessels we fall in with, but we never of. fer violence to their crews or passengers, We destroy British properly because we con- ceive ourselves aggrieved, and have no other way of obtaining satisfaction for our wrongs; but with' private individuals we are not at enmity." "If not deemed intrusive, permit me to in- quire what those wrongs are of which you complain? It might, perhaps," said the Count, " be in my power somewhat to re- lieve them." "I thank you from my heart, but they are too deep and of too long standing to be reach- ed even by your friendly hand; but be seat- ed, sir, and I will tell you a few of them, and then yofi may judge whether I have not rea- son for my mode of life ;" and seating them. selves on the sofa whi'ch had been vacated by Elizabeth's withdrawal to her state-room, Rocerigo continued- "My real family name, with the place of my birth, I shall omit for various reasons; sufficient that I say my parentage is far from humble, for the blood which courses through my veins claims its origin from titled ancestors. In early youth'I entered one of H. B. M. ships, as a midshipman, which station I held for five years, serving on board three ships, in each of which I had, the honor to be engaged in several actions- with what credit to myself, let the despatches of my several commanders to the Lords of  the Admiralty speak. At the age of twenty . one, by the help of goodl- fortune and the influence of a wealthy relative, I received the appointment of 1st Lieutenant to H. B. M. shill--. It was my misfortunein this ship to be placed under the command of an indivi- dual who had no claim to the title of gentle- man, or to hardly any other, save that of a brute and tyrant. Our whole cruise was marked by a constant series of abuse and insult from this miserable apology for a man, and it was with the greatest difficulty we could keep the men from rising in open mutiny. On these occasions he would ex- hibit the most contemptible cowardice, call- ing on and almost supplicating his officers to stand by him and use their influence to quell the storm he had been the means of raising., As he was the commander of the ship, I did my best to obey his orders and discharge my duty, notwithstanding which, his enmity to me was such, that he would take, every opportunity in his power to po. voke me to some act of disobedience which wou d warrant him in, placing me under ar- ,res 3r removiog me out of his w My.   / "I Kad a sister-God bless her!-but she 11  Is at rest now,) said he, with a husky voice, s as a single tear sprung from his eye and fell  -to the floor, "a sister- as- lovely in character ] ax she was beautiful in person, whose every t want it was my greatest happiness to supply  -whose very existence seemed entwined - with my own-and whose reputation was  dearer to me than the apple of my eye. This  ovely, angelic being, had, it seems, taken the  fancy of the brute under whose command I f then was. He had met with her at a ball r given some few evenings before we were to  sail,' and after I had been attached to his,  vessel. His deportment towards her on this 1 evening (which I did not learn till many N years after, my sister being afraid to tell me for fear of rash cousequences,) was so coarse,  vulgar9 and free, that she was- obliged to : call me to her side and request me to conduct hzr to another part of the room, the heat, she  said, being too oppressive. A curse on my stupidity, that I did not see the cause of her wish to be removed--but I did not, and for years remained in ignorance of her injured feelings. Commodore  --,chagrined and mortified, and riot doubting that I should be made acquainted with his conduct, conceived the most deadly hatred for my. sister, and was determined to be revenged for her pre- suming to- leave his company. While in port his manner toward me was winning and affable, but being once out at sea, and being satisfied that I still remained ignorant of his brutal behavior, he was determined to have me out of' his way, by provoking me to some glaring act of mutiny, which would forever  remove all fear of my resentment, well know- ing that he would feel it, should I ever be made acquainted with the real cause of my sister's leaving him so abruptly. Failing to provoke me off my guard by his petty acts of tyranny, he took a bolder and surer course, "One day, having invited several of his officers, myself included, to dine with, him, which invitation could not well be refused, we repaired to his cabin at the appointed hour, and taking the seats assigned us at table, commenced doing justice to the good things before us. The cloth being removed, and wine introduced, the Commodore, in somewhat an excited tone, said, addressing me: "That's a d-- fine looking girl, that sister of yours-I should like to club com- missions with her, but her reputation is too bad for-" without waiting for him to finish his sentence, I sprang from my seat, and before I could be prevented, with one blow hurled the foul defamer to the floor. "Take that!"I cried, "you cowardly tra- ducer of more excellence than your brutish soul can conceive!" "Seize him!" said the groveling wretch, as with my. foot upon his neck I pinned him  to the  cabin floor. Bestowing a kick upon him which sent his worthless carcase half across the toom, I turned to my brother officers and said: "Gentlemen, I surrender myself to you; roptcan judge if the foul slander which llat wretch has dared to utter 'igainst the   name of a beloved, an adored, sister, was sufficient to merit the punishment it has re- ceived." Delivering my sword to the' '2 Lieutenant,'I folded my arms and awaited the approach of the sergeant of marines, in whose custody I was placed. Commodore - , rising from his humbling position, with' face black with passion, and voice choked with rage, ordered me to be placed in confinement and doubly ironed.; and, as. 1 followed the officer, I heard him add: "Let no one, on pain of death, speak to him, for the d-'d scoundrel shall swing for this, and sweet will be my revenge." I was conducted below, but not a man on, board could be found who would put an iron on me, while the crew rose in a body, and swore that my limbs should never be encumbered with man- acles. One dark night, about eight bells, the sentry who stood guard at my door, tapped- gently, and in a subdued'whisper asked if I was asleep--upon my replying, he cautiously; opened the door, and with noiseless step came in. Seating himself near me, he in- formed me that the crew had resolved I should escape, and to effect this, had launch- ed a canoe belonging to one of the officers, and which had been stowed under the berth- deck, and into which they had put oars and plenty of provisions, not forgetting a good. supply of water and spirits. "The boat," continued he, "lies alongside, directly be- , neath the port connected with this ioom. Every nman, including the marines, is to te blind as a bat and see nothing-we are not more than half a mile from Porto Rico," ,(for we were bound into Jamaica) "and now, sir, you have nothing 'to do but lower yourself down by this rope," (taking a small coil from under his jacket) "cut the painter and stand away broad off. You must be lively, sir, for that d-d old beef-eater will be on deck shortly, to smell the air, and may smell a rat;" so, grasping his hand and thanking him for his daring, I bade him bear my warmest gratitude to the ship's crew, lowered myself into the boat, cut her aadrifl, a nd when at a safe distance, seized the oars, which they had taken the precau- tion to muzzle, and pulled with a good wi!. for Porto Rico. As I was entering Ponce, I met a vessel coming outward, bound foi Axnerica, the captain of which, on hearing my story, very kindly consented to give me a passage. My boat was soon, with all its contents, taken on board, and after a pleas- ant voyage of fifteen days, we arrived in Norfolk, Virginia. Among the many things with which the brave tars had laden my boat, I found a bundle of canvas tied up and directed to "Lt. -  , from the crew of H. B. M. ship ---- ," on opening which, 'there were a hundred doubloons which they had generously collected, thinking, undoubt- edly, that I should be u'nprovided with funds -but in this they were mistaken, for beside a very valuable watch, I had billi in my  pocket to the amount of two thousand pounds. After residing at Norfolk a yeai. 'before I     could find a vessel for England, I at length took passage in a. ship bound lor London. On my arrival there, I found that my wealthy relative had died, leaving me sole heir to a vast estate, but that before his body was hardly cold in the grave, Commodore ---- had arrived and preferred charges against me of mutiny and instigating the crew also to mutiny, and finally of desertion to the ene- lny. These charges were-admitted by gov- ernment, without a. hearing, and the whole of my property confiscated. But the demon was not yet satisfied. My mother having gone out one evening and left, my sister alone, this villian, who had, as I was informed, been watching a favorable opportunity, entered the house with two ruffians like himself, and be- Lore she could scream for assistance, gagged and dragged her to a post-chaise which stood near by,.and then drove for Portsmouth, where Commodore ---- had a yacht. They di- rectly stood out for sea, intending to make for France, but the third day after she left, the boat was found bottom up, with one of my sister's shoes floating near by--all on board having perished. My poor widowed. mother, unable to bear up under such a load of misery, was found one morning dead in her bed. The catalogue 'of woe was too much for me. I was seized with a brain fever which for weeks kept me on the verge of the ,rave-but I had not yet drained the 'bitter cup. My constitution proved too strong for the power of the disease, and in two months time I rose from my couch of suffer- ing only to be removed to the Tower; officers of government, having been informed of my residence, came to my lodgings and airested me the first morning I rose from my bed.. On the first return of reason I had endeavored to soothe my lacerated feelings with the hope, as soon as my health would permit, of satis- factorily revenging myself on that government that had so grossly wronged me; but by my subsequent arrest and confinement in the Tower, which I had reason to suppose was to be my grave, all hopes of obtaining redress for my wrongs were cut off, and I abandoned myself to the most bitter and desponding feelings. Seated one evening on my straw, and in- dulging in these gloomy thoughts, I was aroused by a bullet falling at my side, envel- oped in a piece of white paper on which was written,-"Cheer up, my hearty; old Oakuum's afloat, and damme if he lets his first Lieuten- ant lay aground while he floats-so if this hoards you, just tip us my own whistle," (which was the first five notes of Auld Lang Syne) " and bowse away on the small line at- tached to the bullet, when you will find some Small matters, very good where iron bars and such like are in the way, and to-morrow night. a: eight bels, tip us old Beefeater's compli- ments," (which was a loud and peculiar clearing of the throat, always preceding an order for punishment) "and when you hear the answer which a certain saucy tar used to give," (the mewing of a cat, which he used to imitate among the crew when he heard the   Comm: dore's compliments, as lit used uo ca them) " lower away your cord, and when it receives a pull, hoist your fish in board- which, instead of a fish, mayhap to be a haw- ser, very good for lowering anything heavy from aloft, especially when a boat, with a dozen brave tars, lies moored beneath to re- ceive it." Tpon exanining the bullet I found attach. ed to it a small line 'of very fine, white git, which could hardly be perceived at a shor distance. I gave the whistle, and drawing up the line, received several small-sized but first-rate instruments for cutting the iron grating of my window, besides two small bot- tles of vitrol. I immediately applied myself to the task of clearing the window of its oh structions, and before morning accomplished it sufficiently to admit my body to pass through the opening. Having satisfied myself of this, I carefully replaced the bars, so that, my operations could not be easily discoverrd. and seating myself again on the straw. atsumel' the same desponding and miserable deport- ment that I always exhibited before my keep- ers. This day the wheels of time seemed to roll more heavily than ever before. At length the evening came, and with it the keeper, who seemed unusually watchful antd suspi- cious. My heart beat quick as he approach- ed the. grating and raised his hand to the bars. I averted my head, for I dared( not let him encounter the deep anxiety I knew was de- picted on my countenance. Suddenly some thing fell heavily to the stone-floor, and, so deep'was my excitement, that I hlad almost exclaimed aloud in the bitterness of my dis- appointment, but mastering my feelings I re- mained as before, immroveable. The keeper with an oath at his own clumsiness, stooped to pick up a key which he had Iropped from his belt; and in replacing it, he forgot, or omitted at least, to resume the examination of the window, and appearing satisfied with the security of his prisoner, retired from the roons, bolting the door as he passed-out. I now awaited with extreme impatience, and 'the deepest solicitude, the approach of the hour for the appearance of my brave friends I hardly dared for a moment flatter myself with the hope of success, guarded as I knew the Tower to be-but I knew also the fear- lessness and daring of my friends, though from this very recklessness of exposure on their part, the discovery and defeat of the whole plot might ensue, as well as the arrest of the party, and I almost blamed myself for allowing the generous tat's to proceed thusa far in an attempt which stemed to be so ut- terly hopeless and would probably inv6lv- the whole of them in destruction. However I was determined not to look back now, and should I once place my foot on terra firma without those walls, was resolved in case ot discovery to die with them. At length, the long-wished-for hoar arri- ved. The night was propitious, being pitchy dark. All was still around as the great charnel house, save only the deep, heavy breathings of my heart, which,- at eves   seenled to send forth an audible sound r its prison-house. I tried to give the tha al agreed upon, but my voice was the oked and refused to obey iy efforts to give sil it utterance. I succeeded at last, but no an- brc awer met my anxious ear. I feared that sp] they had been' discovered and obliged to the abandon the attempt, or perhaps had been co arrested; and I was again blaming myself a for involving those generous lads in my ruin, op when a low, faint, but distinct mewing fell jo an my ear. I hastened to lower the line, fearing that a long continuance of the sound ca would excite suspicion. It soon ceased, and th feeling a gentle twitch on the cord, I drew it up carefully and with some difficulty-the th object made fast was so heavy, that I dread- h ed every instant lest the slight line would cr part, but finally I succeeded in getting into sa he window the end of a stout rope, and or taking a secure turn round a bar of iron t placed athwart the window, I let myself B down to the ground, which I had no sooner ti reached than I was grappled by .a sentry, a who said, as he seized me; "' Ha! my young s pigeon, so you'd be after-" At this mo-  ment he received a heavy blow in the face  from the fist of Oakum, (who, on hearing .his t exclamation, came to my rescue and struck r him) which laid him senseless at our feet. s Gagged and blindfolded, he was lifted into s the boat, we sprung after, and with muffled  oars pulled for tnis vessel, which lay at an-  chor about ten miles below. The boat, I found, was manned by a dozen brave fellows 1 from the ship I cruised in last. After pull- ing in silence for about an hour and a half, we came alongside the Meteor, who lay with all sails loose and springs to her cable, ready to get under way. On reaching her deck, I discovered to my surprise, that she was en- tirely manned by the ship's crew before men- tioned, who crowded around me, expressed the most unbounded joy for my deliverance, and with one voice declared me their com- mander, and themselves ready to go' wher- ever I should please to direct the vessel. After they had finished speaking, I thanked them warmly for their bravery and daring in res- 'cuing me from prison, in which I informed them I had been unjustly confined, and after giving them a history of all my wrongs, (which recital they occasionally interrupted with deep imprecations of revenge,) told them I would accept the honor conferred on me. an one condition-which was, that we should advocate and defend the cause of the wrong- ed and suffering Americans, and attack and destroy all British property, whenever and wherever we should meet with it, but in no case to shed blood, except in self defence, and never injure other than-the property of the British nation. "We are not pirates, my lads," I concluded, "but freemen, resolved s fight for, and (if need be) to die in the cause of Freedom. What say, my lads, do you agree to my plan? Shall we espouse the cause of America? If so, let's swear we'll never lay down the sworl while we hart, strength. to wield it, till th3 banner of   Freedom floats proudly a; d-unmcAested over that oppressed country.' With one voic they answered, '"We swear!"  Landing, still btlinded, the sentry' whom we had brought with us, a fair seven-knot-breeze springing up, we immediately stood down the Thames and. out to sea. Shaping our course for the West Indies, and establishing  a depot among the Caycos, we commenced operations-with what success let British journals speak."' "But," said Count Montmorency, "hoW came' that ship's crew to have command of the schooner?" "I will inform you: the ship was lost on the coral reefs, among the Caycos, on het homeward passage from  Jamaica, aftet cruising among the islands; all hands saving themselves in the boats, and landing on the Island of Hayti, where the men left their officers and proceeded in search of me. Having saved gold enough from the wreck they purchased this vessel at St. Johns after being there about four months, and set sail for America. Arriving at Hampton Roads, a boat's crew went up to Norfolk whe e they obtained information of my having left for England. With the daring natural to them they resolved to follow me. , and having refitted and well armed the ves sel, they set sail for the British Channel , Here they spoke with a merchantman from London, who informed them of my capture and imprisonment in the Tower. The'crew then unanimously resolved to effect, if possi- ble, my rescue, and cruising off the mouth of the Thames, they sent in a boat's crew, the result of whose expedition you already S know."' I  "And so,' Roderigo, you have espoused the -hopeless cause of the Americans! Take my my word for it, sir, they cannot effect the ob- d ject for which "they are contending, and I , very much fear you are only laying up in [ store more suffering for yourself and those r- under your command. You have done me a er service that neither thanks nor wealth can, m sufficiently reward. Hadt it not' been for s- your noble courage I should now be child- ed less--you have preserved to me one to pro- oer mote whose happiness I would make any s sacrifice. I am wealthy, and if you will dis- ed band your crew and come with us, I will m cheerfully share my fortune with you, and ie. even' then co'nsider myself greatly your Id debtor." g-  "I thank you sincerely, Count, but the nd wealth of the Indies could not tempt me to nd quit my brave'crew to whose generosity I no am indebted, for my life. .Connt Montmo- nd rency, at the Governor's house at Kingston, he I last met your'charming daughter. From ny the first moment of seeing her, I became pas- 'ed sionately and sincerely her admirer. I lived he and breathed only in her presence. The do hours flew rapidly by, and I felt that we ise must soon part. I candidly confessed to her, ear my feelings, assured her of my unalterable we affection, begged her to bless me with one of sentence of esteem an?. friendship before we     parted, and tc allow rae the pleas are at some- ftture time of paying my respects to her, which I hope to have it in my power to do completely divested of all mystery, and in hiy own and true name. The generous girl did bless me with assurances of her sincere friendship and remembrance. We bade adieu-I was miserable, and resolved to fol- low you at all hazards, make you acquainted with my true history, and ask, as I now do, the honor of addressing your daugh- ter, when I can do so without reproach to you." "Roderigo, the happiness of my. daughter is the dearest, the only wish of my heart. I have suspicion that her feelings are some-. what in your favor, and if you will abandon your present enterprize we will retire to France, and I will not only consent to your union, but will make you my sole heir." "Tempt me not, Count Montmorency," re- turned Roderigo, "for although my affection for your daughter is unbounded, and a union with her my most earnest wish; still I cannot break my oath, nor leave my brave and gene- rous lads after their noble exertions in my behalf. I am sure you cannot in your heart desire me to adopt such a base expedient to benefit myself, while at the same time I vio- late the confidence so sacredly reposed in me. No, sir! we have sworn to fight for Freedom, and we can never desert it while the hand of an enemy is raised against it. I cannot agree with you Count Montmorency, as to the hopelessness of the American cause-it is a just one, and if united among themselves they must succeed. I may not live to see it, but my word for it, the time will come when the American flag will float freely and proudly over their shipping in every sea, and God grant that the happy day be not far distant!" So then, Roderigo, you decline my propo- sal," said the Count, somewhat vexed at what he termed the rash and headstrong folly of the too sanguine young man. "Pardon me, Count Montmorency, ifI am seemingly unmindful of your kind ani gene- rous interest in my welfare; I assure you, sir, that I truly and deeply feel it; and-could I consistently accept your offer, I should by so do: ag acquire almost unspeakable happi- ness. To gain the hand of your amiable daughter would indeed be the height of bliss, to me. But in my present situation I may not'entirely think of self-I have in my power the lives and comfort of nearly five- hundred individuals, which I may not barter away far perscnal aggrandizement, and while I respectfully decline taking advantage of your present proposal, allow me to assure you that I am not regardless of your liberality, and also to hope that by declining it. I am not lessening the good opinion with which you and your daughter are pleased to honor me, and that if at some future day I appear before you in my true character, with a name untarnished by deecds of infamy, and against thich no voice will dare utter reproach, you will then receive me as you generously offe so do n',--while I bear a titfe wrongfully i   coupled with dishonor and crime, anil & head for whose capture base coin is offered." "I am sorry Roderigo, that you deem it impossible to Acede to my wishes, for besides feeling as I do under thi. greatest obligation to you, I am also sincerely desirous, so 'ar as may be in my power, of promoting your hap- piness. However, I see that argument would be of no avail and I can only await patient- ly, with. the hope that you will yet be dis- posed to regard my plan more favorably, or else I must defer all idea of discharging this debt of gratitude till you have accomplished the object for which you are at present con- tending. But permit me again to call your attention to the situation of my daughter and ,myself, and request that you will take the earliest opportunity to place us on board some vessel bound either for home or Jamaica." *"When you sent for me, Count Montmo- rency, I was revolving in my mind the best course to pursue in order to relieve you of your present embarrassment, lor I am aware that your position is, at best, uncomfortable. r have thought of a plan which will be at- tended with very little risk provided I can prevail upon all my passengers to conceal the character of this vessel. Of the silence of yourself and daughter I will not permit myself to doubt, but of Capt. Scott and the two others, I am not so certain. I expect shortly to fall in with one of His Majesty's cruisers whose Commander I can very easily deceive, and if you, sir, will prevail upon the rest of my passengers to swear they will not divulge the true character of my barque while on board the British vessel, I will agree to transfer you to her cabin." "I will at once seek them, sir," said the Count, "and have no doubt that I shall soon return with their, written consent to your proposal." Roderigo touched the bell, and Gonzala obeying the summons, he desired him to wait upon Count Montmorency to the apart- ments assigned the gentlemen passengers, and remain to show him back. CHAPTER VIII Before the Count, however, could leave the cabin in which they were, Elizabeth made her appearance, and Roderigo, judging it more congenial to the father's feelings. was about withdrawing also, saying he would come in and ascertain the result of his mis- sion, when Gonzala, should inform him of his return; but seeing his motive, his friend begged of him, if agreeable, to remain where he was, adding: "I need not fear to .eave you with my daughter;" and addressing her, "I doubt not that you, my dear, will find our Captain a very agreeable companion," and bowing himself out, left them alone. "Elizabeth." said Roderigo, seating him- self on the sofa near her and taking her hand in his, " your irind, generous father has made   me the most liberal and tempting oflers to  quit this mode of ,ife-but circumstances of a which I have informed him, and with which t be will doubtless make you acquainted, com- tl pel me at present to afflict myself by refusing a them. I have disclosed to him my sincere tl attachment to yourself, and may I now dare 's to hope I shall continue to hold a place in your affections, though for a season, which t God grant may be of short duration, I must t absent myself from you and from hll that can c make me truely happy."         f ' And has my father's influence then failed to prevail with you, Alphonso?" said Eliza- n beth, sorrowfully; "I will not let any pru- s dish notions of delicacy prevent me from say- r ing how much I depended on his success, for t -you know, Alphonso, that 'the most earnest t desires of my heart are for your happiness t and safety, and I shall indeed be miserable I while I know you are roaming the ocean, t pursued, nay, hunted by your. enemies, and 1 constantly exposed to:danger of capture and  death."  "Nay, fear not, my dearest girl, my life is in the hand of an all-wise and just God, and  His will be done. Your. father will inform a you that I am, not a pirate, and--" 'II never thought you were, God knows I  never believed you so base, but that you had  good and sufficient reasons for your present f course, which' I should be informed of at a  proper time."  * "Thank you, I thank you from my heart,  dear, generous girl, I have indeed just and i powerful reasons, with which as I before r said, your father is acquainted." "But, Alphonso, is there no inducement to make you leave this dangergus warfare?" "Inducements! yes, indeed; but dear Elizabeth, I know you will not be offended with me when;I teli you that it is impossi-- ble at present for me to do so. I have taken an oath with my men never to desert the cause we have espoused, till the object for which we are contending-the Independence of America-is accomplished.  Therefore pain me not by obliging me again to refise all temptations to quit my brave lads at pre- sent. And now, dearest, will you allow me to ask of you one favor before we again sepa- rate, which is, that I may occasionally have the pleasure of writing you, and of hearing from you; if so, in each of my letters I will inform you of my address." "It will indeed delight me to hear of your safety and I will endeavor at times to' write you, provided that by so doing I shall in no case jeopardize your interests or freedom." "Thani 3, .dear Elizabeth, and now let me tell you mrn plans to enable you to reach your destination." He had just detailed to' her the proposal which he had made her father, when the Count returned, bearing in his hand the agreement signed by himself and the other passsengers except Marline Spile, who, on learning the character of the vessel, was ea- ger to join them. Rouerigo, taking the pa- wr, remarked to Count Montmorency that   his word would have. been sufficient-" for," added he, '.I shall rely on you mainly fox the performance of the contract on the part of the other two gentlemen, who may, from the act being in a manner compulsory, dteem themselves when on board another vessel, ab- solved." "You do them injustice, Roderigo," re- turned the Count, " for .I am fully assured of their honor in this matter, and will most cheerfully hold myself personally responsible for their honorable performance of it." "Enough, I am perfectly satisfied and will now go and make sail ;" so saying, Roderigo sought the quarter-deck, and in a few mo- ments 'the Meteor was proudly coursing through the waves, majestically dashing them from her. prow, spurning and tossing them to' the right and left of her path, and leaving them far in her wake quarrelling and , tumbling over each other, as if maddened at being so rtidely interrupted in their gambols, anc as it were, determined to go to logger- heads with each othir and sethe the matter, untiLat length, tired and exhausted, they bur themselves in the bosom of the deep, ant quietly slumber away their anger. For four days did the Meteor continue her triumphant and unmolested course-when on the fifth morning, as the eastern horizon's first blushes gave notice of day's approach, while Roderigo and Roberto were pacing fore and aft the qparter-deck, the latter officer in-  dulging in some light badinage about their female passenger at the expense of his com- mander, who in vain tried to turn the con- versation and put a stop to his'raillery-the lookout aloft gave hail of "Sail ho?" and on being interrogated, said that she was a large ship standing athwart them and was about tvo points on their larboard how, the Meteor then heading N. E., wi th the wind dead aft. Roderigo going aloft with his glass, and satisfying himself with regard to'the strange vessel, returned to the quarter-deck, and or- dering the man at the wheel to head her about east, desired Roberto to hoist a signal that he wished to speak with the stranger, and then adopt the same precautions that were used before, with regard to the guns, the number of men about deck, &c; and then ; having set up Lord Peterborough's private signal at the fore, they continued their course in order to come up with the stranger, who in a short time perceiving their object, haul- ed his wind and stood for them. Roderigo now descended to Elizabeth's ) cabin and informed her that the vessel on board which she was to go, was stanJing ifo e them and would soon be alongside, request- ring her to select any article from the ward- robe which might be of use to her, and pack 1 them in a trunk which he had provided, beg- e ging particularly that she would -ut in the dress she wore when first attirir ng erself ii r his vessel and which he assured f, as pur- a chased expressly for her; then a e-:ng, that - in half an hour he would be ready to take - them on board, he excused his hasty departure t a  *sis prser ce was necessary tin deck. Be O     fore leaving. h iwever, Elizaoeth wished him to send to her cabin the little boy whom Marline Spike had saved from the East In- diaman, and allow him to accompany her to the British vessel. Roderigo toucohed the bell, and bade Gonzala conduct the child to the lady, then returned to the quarter-deck and ordered Roberto to inform the two gen- tlemen that the boat would be ready in a few moments to take them on board an English vessel. The stranger had now approached so near as to enable them easily to distin- guish her character fromn the decks of the Meteor. But Roderigo, almost from the first glance be had had of her through his glass, knew her but too well to be H. B. M. Frigate Britannia, Capt. Thompson. "Brig alloy!" hailed the frigate, "what brig is that, and what do you want?" Roberto, who had seized the trumpet at the first hail, replied that they had the honor to be the bearer of despatches for Capt. Thomp- son-that the vessel was Lord Peterborough's private yacht, with his Lordship .on board, who, if agreeable to Capt. Thompson would come on board the Britannia with a lady, three gentlemen and a boy, whom they had taken from a wreck. "Capt. Thomnson's compliments to Lord Peterborough, and would be very happy to see him with his party on board the frigate, and for this purpose will send the frigate's cut- ter," replied the officer from the Britannia's deck. Roderigo taking the trumpet, answered that he was much obliged to Capt. Thomp- son for his politeness, but would not trouble him to send his cutter, as his own gig was alongside and he would immediately do him- self the honor to come on board. The fri- gate now running under the stern of the Me- eor, rounded to at a short distance from that ressel, whose boat was already manned and n waiting for the party. Roderigo had de- tcended to Elizabeth's cabin immediately af- ter hailing the :ritannia and telling Roberto to heave to. Approaching' and taking her 'and which he pressed'ardently to his heart, he said, " need not tell you, my dear girl, now much I am pained thus soon to part with you, but cruel fate so ordains it and I can only console myself with the hope that our separation will not be long, and that though absent, I shall not be forgotten by You: and rest assured that for myself, I shall ever be true to my vows of constancy." "To myself also," returned Elizabeth, will our disunion be a ceaseless source of anxiety and unhappiness-and as you value my peace make your absence as short as possible, avoid all unneccessary risks and think well of my father's offer; and when I seek my pillow at night I will pour forth my prayers to Almighty God for your safety, and may he bless and prosper you, Roderigo, and. return you to me unharmed." '"May God bless thee, my angel," exclaim- ed Roderigo, as he folde' her to his heart, and pressed his lips to her, " fear not, my    Elizabeth, that I shall ever needlessly *   expose myself to danger, or that I shall not take the earliest opportunity again to appear before you-and now, dearest, pardon me if I hasten you, as I dare not keep the frigate longer waiting ;" and again pressing her to his heart, he breathed. an ardent farewell. Giving her his arm, he led her from the cabin and placing her in the chair on deck (which was rigged for the occasion) she was soon safely seated with tne little boy in the stern sheets of the gig. Count Montmorency and the officer saved from the East India- mart, now appeared at the side and were 'quickly lowered, the officer much muffled, as he was laboring under a severe cold brought on by his exposure. Roderigo, seating him- self beside Elizabeth, bade themshove off and let fall, and in a few moments they were alongside the Britannia, which vessel also had a chair rigged and let down for the lady and little boy who were instantly on the fri. gate's deck, and conducted to the cabin.  Roderigo having informed all the party previous to leaving the Meteor, what sort of story he should tell, now approached Capt, Thompson, Who was stationed on the quarter- deck, and after introducing the Count, Capt. Scott, and the officer, and relating the cir-, cums tances which produced the acquaintance on his part, then introduced himself as Lord Peterborough, and stated that having spoken with H. B. M. ship Isabella, Capt. Smith, he had the pleasure of handing him a package with which he had been entrusted by that commander; remarking that since leaving that ship he had received intelligence which rendered his presence somewhat necessary at Gibraltar, and he was consequently induced to change his previous intention of returning to London and proceed immediately to the former port-but having fallen in with the wreck before mentioned, he was again indu- ced to run for England till he could find some vessel on board which to place his passen- gers. Capt. Thompson having bowed a kind reception to the other gentlemen, .shook Ro- derigo by the hand and assured his Lordship he was extremely happy to be honored by his presence, on board, and concluded by inviting him and his friends below. Roderigo will- ingly accepted this invitation in hope of again seeing Elizabeth before he quit the ves- sel, but, much to his regret, on entering the cabin he found she was not present: how- ever, he avoided exhibiting any disappoint. ment, and entered into conversation witk Capt. Thompson concerning the object of his cruise, "which," said he, "I understand is to overhaul that slippery rogue, Roderigo- and slippery enough you will find him, sir, should you chance to fall in with him." He then narrated some of the particulars of his own escape from the Fredonia, altering and reversing circumstances to suit the occasion, "and, thanks to a dark night," added he, "for the honor I now have to ielate the affair, in person, to you.. I would, with due reverence, advise, a strict scrutiny of all vessels you may fall in with, for I hear, sir, that this Ro- derigo is a daring fellow and assumes   9teh different shapes as he finds corvrni- hi et."                  as "'I am truly obliged to you, my Lord, for en your suggestions, and you may depend that ki should I ever have the happiness to fall in so with the precious rascal, he shall not escape as me assume what d-sguise he may. But th come, my Lord, do' me the honor to take a d glass of wine with me, and you gentlemen, ed come, fill your glasses, said Capt. Thomp- w son, placing a decanter of London Particu- or a:r before Roderigo. Having finished their  wine and drank mutual good wishes and sue- p cess, Roderig- -.marked that being unwilling w to losthe the fine reeze, then blowing, he would, b] with his permission, join his vessel after ta- s - king leave of the lady-then, cordially shak- a ing hands with Count Montmorency, Capt. es Scott, and the officer, he followed. Capt. g Thompson to the private cabin, to which sr Elizabeth had retired. Here they were in- n stantly admitted, and rising from her seat at p their approach, she gave her hand to Roderi- go, saying, "My Lord, I shall ever keep in o mind your generous care and kindness while q on board your vessel, and be assured, my gra- n titude to the preserver of my life shall never -ease while that life exists."     I "Madam," replied Roderigo, ; the know- b ledze that I have in any manner been instru- v mental in promoting your happiness and sav- - ing you from an untimely grave, will ever be  a source of the highest gratification and  pleasure, and it is with much regret I assure r you that I now take leave of one whose pres-  ence on beard my vessel has been an honor I and delight to me. But pardon me, allow 1 me to introduce you to my friend, Capt. Thompson-the daughter of Count Montmo- ency, Capt. Thompson-and I assure you, sir, that I very mich envy you your happi- ness in having such a passenger on board." Captain Thompson, bowing to the lady, expressed himself honored by her presence, and assured Roderigo that he was under great obligations to him for introducing such a companion to cheer the dull, monotonous scenes of a sea voyage; and taking up the boy, remarking his strong resemblance to Ro- derigo (which Elizabeth now for the first  time noticed) asked the child what his name was? The little fellow softly replied, "' Al- bert." Eiizabeth then mentioned the circum- stances of his rescue firom. the wreck of the East fndiaman, and her having taught him  since he lost his parents to consider her as his mother. "Poor little fellow," said Capt. Thompson, " and does not the officer know him, or throw any light on his parentage?" Roderign replied, A" that from the moment of the officer's coming on board, being in a rery exhausted state, he had kept his berth, and from the circumstance of his appearing to labor under a deep melancholy, he had avoided asking him any questions concern- ing the wreck-and," continued he, " doubt very much if he has seen the boy, for, although they were in the boat together, I ob- seived he seemed so completely absorbed in   his own mournful and desponding thougtls as to be apparently unmindful of the pres- ence of any one. I doubt not, sir, that your kindness aml attention will soon, in a degree, soften the anguish of his heart'; and. so far as human sympathy may go toward healing the wound evidently rankling there, ant rao- duced by some domestic bereavement connet t- ed with the wreck of his vessel, I am 'sure he, will receive not only yours, but that of every one on board your ship. But, madam, I regret I may no longer at present allow myself the' pleasure of your much valued society, and so with a sincere prayer for the Almighty's blessing upon you, and a wish fdr your safe speedy, and happy restoration to your friends and country, I bid you adieu"-and he press- ed her hand with a warmth that sent a min- gled flood of joy aDvi sorrow to her heart, then snatching up the boy and imprinting an ear- nest and fond kiss on his cheek, he hurriedly put him down and quit the apartment. A few paiting compliments were exchanged on deck, and descending the side, Roderigo was quickly on board the Meteor. Both vessels now made. sail, the Britannialaying up as near the wind as possible and heading about S. S East, and the brig standing about East. The breeze being fresh- from the S. West, the two vessels were soon' hull down. As soon as Roderigo found himself completely beyond spy-glass distance from the frigate's tops, he set all hands again to work in changing the rig to that of a schooner; this done, spreading all the canvas he could crowd on her, he close hauled South till towards night, : then tacked and stood West till midnight, when he again changed his course and con- tinued South for the remainder of the night and part of the next day. Being satisfied - that he was now far ahead of the ship, and-the ' wind being favorable; he stood direct for the Caycos, a group of small islands at the nor- , therly end of Hayti. Arriving in safety at r the largest and most inward of these, he en- tered the dangerous channel leading to his s rendezvous, the navigation of which was e known only to himself and Roberto; and' - reaching it, brought his vessel to aflhor tI close under the 'shelter of the high rocks e which com'pletely screened him from obser- - vation. After having everything properly - secured, Roderigo ordered the boats to be go e out, and leaving but a small watch on board n all hands to go on shore for recreation and s I to refit, previous to a long cruise. The crew certainly did not need much urging to induce , them to be lively in obeying this order, and , but ,a short time elapsed before they were gambolling and honeking with each othe. it wrestling, jumping, running arid tumbling a on the fresh green grass, with all thewild up- h, roarious merriment of urchins just issuing g from the village school, with whom fresh air id and freedom of lungs and limbs, together n- with the bright, joyous, and tempting fields, I are as essential to mirth, as is the appearance r, of the bright god of day to gladden the heart b- of nature. in  At same distance from his conr' ades is one'     -halt' sitting, half reclining upon the grass, with his weather-heaten cheek resting on his hard hand, his eyes gazing with a mournful, yet half-pleasing expression, at vacancy, his manly and iron-wroughtchest heaving a sigh as he strives in vain to check the single ris- ing tear escaping from his lee-scuppers--'his heart's in the highlands, his heart is not here." We would fain leave him and not in- trude ourselves upon his meditations.-But here comes Saucy Bill, a sworn enemy to all moralizing. "Holloa, Jack! on your beam- ends, and damme, eye-pumps rigged too?" exclaimed he, as he brought down his out- spread hanc on Jack's shoulder with a force that would have shivered to splinters less firm timbers. Holloa, my old boy, I say, why you look as chop-fallen as old Ebony did t'other day when holding on to the water- bucket rope, he hove over the side the cap- tain's pig that he had just dressed for cook- ing. Why you're as melancholic as old Dame Snufftrap was that ere day when old Parson Lanternjaw came a courtin' on her. and while he was telling his yarn, her favor- ite pet, Jocko, sprung on her back. seized her head-gearing, and with one spring reached the rafters, leaving the old lady's head look- ing, for all the world, like a cocoa-nut strip- ped of its shell." "Avast there, Bill, and don't be poking yec jokes at me, for you see, I was just taking a bit of a snooze here, when my eyes sprung a leak from this d--d dust blowing into 'em." "Now Jack,' tell that to the marines, 'case you see as how I can't go it, 'specially when there arn't wind enough to float a feather.- No! no! Jack-some o' them ere shore-go- ing gals have boarded you in your dreams- I know all about it, and 'taint no more use nor anything, to try to, get to windward of Saucy Bill in that way. So, old boy, just tip us your flipper and mount yInur pegs, and let's be after joining our messmates." Seizing Jack by the arm, with a sudden ferk raised him to his feet, and locking arms, Saucy Bill dragged him away to his com- panions, singing as he went along, with a good-humored look at his companion, " Oh! saw ye the lass with the bonnie blue e'en." Jack's low spirits soon took their departure, and in a few moments he was' as wild and uproarious as any of them. Roderigo had remained on board the Me- I teor and was seated in his cabin alone, with  hiselbows resting on the table, his chin bu- Sed in his hands and a countenance betray- ing a mind deeply absorbed. "It is true,"  said he soliloquising, "it is true I can de-  pend upon them on board mry vessel, but they  are so fond of spinning their yarns that a something might leak out to cause suspicion t -beside, what if she should happen to take s passage on board the same vessel? How- r ever, I think that could hardly be, as her i Commander will not be in much of a mood d to return without making another effort. w If Roberto could get a footing there, he g might be of much service in case of trouble. s 3ut there again, let me see-there must be e   s, the Fredonia, Isabella, and Britannia, and if is they should sail in company, there would be 1, a pretty kettle of fish! however, the Meteor is could show the two latter a good pair of h heels, while Roberto might drive the Fredo- - niaa into the net. By heavens! I'll try it- is but in the first place, let's see what he says )t to the project;" anl, touching the bell, he - bade Gonzala desire Roberto to step into the it cabin. As soon as the lieutenant made his "appearance, Roderigo unfolded to him his -plans and requested his opinion. Roberto, ' after some reflection, expressed his confidence, - in the success of his commander's project, and e declared that nothing should be wanting on s his part to ensure it. The yawl was now , sent on shore, for' water and supplies, with y orders for the men to repair on board. By -night the Meteor was refitted for a long - cruise, and the next morning at daybreak she - weighed anchor and stood out to sea. d r -    CHAPTER  IX. r d  It was at the Governor's house, about two - months before their departure in the Canso - for England, that Count Corregio first saw Count Montmorency and his daughter. The r fermer Count boasted his descent from a long a line of illustrious Italian noibes: and pos- sessed an open, intelligent countenance, that to a careless observer might seem to indicate amiability of temper, and generosity of heart, but a more attentive beholder could not'fail -' to be struck with a certain vague feeling of repugnance and distrust, as in the workings of that countenance, when unobserved, were e aeen the dark glances which occasionally shot fron, his eyes and the sardonic smile that at times lit up, or rather darkened, his features. But he was generally too much on his guard to allow of thus reading him. He had arriv- ed in Kingston but a few weeks before, in a dark, rakish-looking brig, commanded by himself, which he reported at the Custom House as his pleasure yacht "Fortune," fromn Naples, on a cruise for his own amusement. At first there were many who had strong sus picions of the honesty-of his intentions, but a strict examination of his papers, backed' by his frank deportment to all, eradicated these dark thoughts from their minds, and Count Corregio-the gay arid handsome Count- was soon the lion of Kingston. * It was not long ere the beauty of Elizabeth Montmorency attracted his attention, and he determined to add her name to the long lis' of broken-hearted fair ones, who mournedl alas! too late, their rashness in giving him their hearts. For this amiable purpose he soon gained an introduction to her: his win- ning manners, extensive information, highly intellectual conversation, and fascinating ad- dress, interested if not pleased her, and he was beginning to fancy himself deep in her good graces, when his eye encountered the scrutinizing gaze of our hero, who, with foldi ed arms, was standing in one corner of th   room conversing with Count Montmorency. Coiregio's eye 'fell beneath his searching' glance, and turning to Elizabeth, he asked if she knew the gentleman conversing with her atther? Her countenance lit up with delight on recognizing the person of Roderigo, but uo looking toward Count Corregio to answer his question, she was surprised, and almost "ghtened., at the demoniacal expression of "s. eyes, as she saw the effect the recognition produced. "Really, sir Count, what means that look? I trust I have not given offence?" 'Offence! fair lady-it is I who am so unfortunate. I sincerely beg pardon and pray you to overlook it, and attribute it to a twinge of the gout which at times most se- riously affects ne," said Corregio, as he hasti- ly endeavored to resume his former compo- sure-" the gealteman, I perceive, is your  friend, may I be allowed to ask his name?'  "It is Capt. Eggleston," returned Eliza-'. beth, forgetting in his respectful and altered demeanor, the recent affront. "An officer of the navy, I presume," in- quiringly continued the Count--but before i Elizabeth could reply to the query, the object of their conversation was at her side, and forgetting it, she introduced the two gentle- men. Count Corregio bowed jlow and -ex- pressed himself very happy in Capt. Eggle- ston's acquaintance: Roderigo replied cold- ly and with much hauteur to his compliments, for he had seen the expression of his face at the moment of Elizabeth's recognition of himself, and that'expression had confirmed all his suspicions. Determined to free her from the Count's company, he approached, and offering his arm, invited her to enjoy the fresh air on the piazza and escape the suffocati'ig atmosphere of the crowded rooms, and turning to Corregio, remarked: "I am sure the Count," (emphasls'ing some- what markedly the title) "' will excuse you." ("Oh! most certainly-though I have al- most a mind to insist on my right of escort; however, I doubt not your fair companion will excuse me, and, for this time I will yield it, especially as I see my gay young friend, Miss P--, beckons me," and with a face e. covered with smiles he made his congee to Elizabeth. Turning to obey the summons of the co- quette, his eye, full of contempt, met Roderi- go's, but quailed before his flash of defiance. The Italian's countenance' for an instant seemed black with rage, but the next moment was bright with forced sunshine--as he re- collected he was surrounded by those whose friendship for the present was, at least, conve- nient to him, and addressing Miss P-- with an apparently light and happy heart, he seemed, to a common observer, one of the , gayest there assembled. "Have a care, Signor Count," said the lovely brunette, "have a care of the little cupid who fires his darts from yonder for- ,tess; but I very much doubt if my caution ha not come too late, for even if you have ?scaped your rash exposure to those bright * a   eyes for this time, 1 fear you have caught the charm tnat will, sooner or later, lay you a bound and willing captive at the feet of their fair mistress.") You mistake much, my pretty friend- the arrows of the little god flew harmless by me, for. his comrade-a far more successful archer-that sits enthroned behind those dark, bewitching orbs of thine, had previous- ly so completely pierced me through, that other barbs could' not obtain a hold." "Avaunt! .thou flattering monster-did ' not but yesterday see thee bending low at the feet of the rich planter's daughter-the fair Imogene?"  !"True, but then thou didst not see that I was adjusting the string of her slipper?" ". Indeed, thou gay deceiver, I did not per- ceive that the slipper was in her hand, but perhaps that hand was so closely pressed by thine. Pray tell me, sir Count, do the gay gallants of Italy, when kneeling to tie a slipper, thus passionately bend their gaze in the eyes of her fair daughters? And when 'as suddenly approached, as I most unwitting- ly approached you, do those gallants rise with such impetuous haste as almost to over- turn the intruder? Tie her slipper! for- sooth-I wonder how long it will be ere you make an attempt to tie Miss Montmorency's slipper! Out upon you, for a base deceiver! I'll go and,publish you to all the ladies of Kingston and guard them against your be- ,witching wiles,"-and away flew the rattle- brained girl to a group in the opposite room, where she went on at the same rate; leaving ;the Count leaning against a pillar, which, with three' others, supported a small gallery used as an orchestra. This position he had assumed at his first approach to Mis P--, and with arms folded and an air of as much nonchalance as he could assume, he nodded and smiled, ever and anon, as 'the gay girl before him seemed to require some notice ot her presence, and finally, when she left him, made some, show of an at:empt to detain her, though in his heart bz wished her to the d--1. Alone, and apparently unobserved, ia a secluded corner of the room, he brooded over the insult he had received (for Roleri- go's look was still distinctly before him) and meditated some plan of revenge.' "By hea- vens!" he inwardly mutterred, "he shall smart for it; ahd that proud girl shall yet kneel in supplication to me," and he-qnickly, and as he thought unnoticed, left the room. But not so-Count Montmorency had foi some time, in fact from the moment of Ro- derigo's joining his daughter, kept nis eye upon Corregio, and had noticed the workings of his countenance and the revengeful look with which he quitted the apartment; and not doubting that he meditatedsome violence toward Roderigo, he hastily sought that gen- tleman to whom he communicated his sus- picions. His friend assured him that he need not give himself the least uneasiness.-add- ing, that he was truly obliged for the notice .and would be on his guard against any sur- ,pBie.     The conversation now turned on general subjects, and the tri) soon almost forgot that such a person as Corregio existed, so pleas- antly did they enjoy each other's society. Swiftly and unheeded flew the hours, till the full, clear voice of the guard gave notice of midnight. Roderigo started to his feet, apologized for having so long detained them in the open air, and offered his arm to Eliza- beth. ;"Indeed it is damp, and we had bet- ter retire within," said Count Montmorency; and taking the other arm of his daughter,they again entered the crowded rooms, when, after refreshments and parting compliments to their host, they set out for the Count's resi- dence, distant frorm the Governor's about a quarter of a mile. There arrived, Elizabeth lingered upon the threshold renewly to charge Roderigo to be watchful of his enemy. He assured her that he would. bade her good night, and sough his own lodgings. On the morning after the party, Corregio called upon Elizabeth and her father, to pay his respects and to do away, as he said, the unfavorable impression which they seemed to have formed against him. He was re- ceived by both in the most polite but reserved manner, which would have nonplussed any other than a man of Count Corregio's tact, or rather of his consummate hypocrisy. His earnestness and apparent sincerity of man- ner in speaking of his deportment, and his hurried, abrupt departure on the preceding evening, quite convinced them that his alleg- ed reason was the real one-that "it arose from an attack of the gout with which of late he had been nmuch afflicted, and which at times almost unmanned him;" and then, adroitly chatnging the topic from himself to Old Englandj he spoke in glowing terms of the happiness which was is store for them, said he had contemplated a visit to their shores, and anticipated much pleasure in see- ing a country in whose praise so much had been said and sung. There is nothing which goes more directly to the heart than, when long absent from the ' lnd-of our-nativity, we hear that land, that! home around which our very heart strings are entwined, spoken of in terms of affection- ate interest. The happy scenes of youth, the many loved ones that used to encircle the domestic fireside, be they dead or living, 1ll seem to rise up befbre us in the freshness of reality; again the loved tones of father and mother, brother and sister, and valued friends, break upon the ear and fill the heart to over lowing with emotions of kindness -and love to all around; and while the heart sickens at the contemplation of the distance which sep- arates us from childhood's home, the eyes swim with bitter tears as the shade of some dear departed one comes before the mind's eye, and again reveals those features which are engraven on the very soul, seeming again to breathe on the saddened heart those tones of affection which in former years were ac- customed to fall from thpir lips. And those eyes, too-those portals through which the  soul looks from its tenement of clay up td its   God--those breathing eyes, calm, mild, and tlovely, seem anew bent with their wonted gaze of tehderness and love,fall upon us till we feel the roughness of our nature change to gentleness, and the soul become so filled with generous emotions, that harsher feelings can no where find a resting place within. Count Corregio could and did talk feelipgly on this subject, and the effect was such as he had hoped. Ere he rose to depart, Count Montmorency and his daughter had entirely discarded every adverse feeling from their minds; but the change in his favor Corregio appeared not to perceive, and his manner was most respectful and corteous as he begged pardon for having trespassed so long on their politeness, his principal object in calling be- ing to apologize for his unnatural conduct' the previous evening. Count nMontmorency begged him not to mention the subject again, assuring him it had passed from their minds, and that they should be happy to see him at their house as often as he could make his vis- its convenient and find them agreeable. This invitation Corregio did not fail to improve, but studiously avoided a meeting with Rode- rigo (whenever he could do so without caus- ing remark). He was careful never to speak ill of him when at the Count's house, and if accident did throw him in his way, his de portment was so gentlemanly that Roderigo, although he could not banish his feelings of dislike, yet sufficiently disguised it as never to treat him with rudeness-still doubting him, and determining to watch him closely. Thus did these two continue their frequent visits to Elizabeth, but actuated by far differ- ent sensibilities. With Roderigo, all was pure and holy affection-with Corregio, all was bitterness, hatred and revenge, which burned and fiercely rankled in his heart, al- most defying its efforts to prevent its explo- sion, while his exterior was decked in Smiles and the utmost gentleness of demeanor. He could not avoid seeing that Elizabeth was at tached to his detested rival, and that, al though she strove to treat them with the same urbanity, she evidently welcomed him with the tongue, while she welcomed .Roderi. go with the heart. One evening his feelings had been more than usually excited as he witnessed .he sweet and expressive smile turned upon Cap. Eggleston (by. which name alone he knew him, and certainly never suspected him the possessor of another) as he handed her a piece of music, which he had composed ex- pressly for herself. Although its reception filled his heart with the burning lava of envy and hatred, he still mastered his passions and begged them, (as it was a duo,) to favor him with a hearing of it. But deeply did he re pent the request-the music was of a most touching character, while the words seemed to his disordered mind, winged spirits of love. The full, rich, organ-like tones of Roderigo's voice fell on his ear like the howl of the de- moniac spirit sinking in its bed of liquid flames; and the soft silvery voice of E iza- beth grated on his heart, scorching and with   ring his very life blood; stil. on its conclu- 'sion, with warmth and apparent honesty of manner, he extolled the piece and its execu- tion. But he felt that he could not long con- trol the pent-up fires which fiercely raged within him, and after a few moments he pleaded other engagements, and left them. No sooner did he gain the open air, and feel himself unobserved, than he gave full veat to his fiendish passions. "'By the living God, he dies," muttered he, as with clenched fist he struck the air.- "Holla, massa! what for you go kill nig.- ger?"'-sung out a poor fellow as he roled on the ground from the effect of 'the blow, " me get em pass from missus to see Dinah, and you no hab ask me noting." "Get oat of my Way, you black coundrel," almost roared Copregio, as he gave the negro a. kick, who quickly picked himself up and made off. Mea-rwhila the assailant contin- ued to pace t I Street, with his hand firmly grasping his dagger-hilt, his hat over his eyes, and his cloak closely wrapped around him. Twice he passed the house containing his rival, in hope to meet him as he came out, when unarmed, as he knew hint to be, he would fall an easy victim. As he was approaching for the third time he heard the door open; hastily concealing himself be- hind a tree, he could distinguish the soft and tender tones of a woman's voice-a kiss- "Fire and furies," muttered Corregio, "' I can no longer bear this," and he was on the point of rushing from his hiding-place, when the door closed, and footsteps approached. He awaited with maddened soul the object of his revenge, and although but a few moments elapsed, yet it seemed an age ere those foot- steps reached the spot where he was conceal- ed. At length they fell near him, and the night being intensely dark, Corregio, with the stealthy tread of the cat, approached his victim, and with a deadly blow buried his dagger to the hilt in his back. With a deep' groan the wounded man fell heavily to the ground: withdrawing the weapon, the assas- sin was about to indict another blow, to make assurance' doubly sure, when hearing voices at a short distance, he hastily retreated. On the following morning with lightened heart, he paid a visit'to Count Montmorency, fully prepared in case the previous evening's event should have come to Elizabeth's knowl.. edge, to exhibit proper and natural feelings of astonishment and horror, and of deep indig.. nation against the cowardly murderer, and to offer his hand and sword to ferret out and punish the villian. BNuch to his relief, how- ever, he found the horrible news had not yet reached them. In the course of conversa.. tion Elizabeth remarked, that his friend Capt. Eggleston had sailed the previous evening lor a, distant port-and Corregio's object now being to keep her' in this ignorance, he de.. ternvned to seek the guard immediately, and and. out what had become of the body, and in case of its not being already buried, with the help of a doubloon or so, to have it done at lnae Making, therefore, but a short visit,.   he took his leave, hoping their mutual friend would have a pleasant passage, as he doubt- ed not it would bea speedy one, and repaired to the Guard House,' Leisurely approaching an officer with whom he was slightly acquain- ted, and who was very quietly smoking his cigar by the shaded front of the house, Coere- gio bade him good morning, and after con- gratulating him on his luxurious repose, in. quired for the news. "'Oh, nothing at all," responded the officer, "only they were cutting up some of their pranks again last night." "Ah! what was that?" "Oh! just nothing, but a little playing with their steel, and leaving their dead game lunbering up the streets for us poor devils to tumble over, these devilish dark nights, be- sides giving us the trouble of carrying it to the river, where we tossed it in, to cheat the land-crabs and go in pursuit of its comrades." The Italian now felt that the coast was clear for him, and. he could hardly contain his joy and satisfaction at the somewhat un- expected, but pleasing information. Assas- sination was not then so rare an occurence as it is now, and the affair was hardly known beyond the precincts of the Guard-House. CHAPTER X. The second morning after the departure of Roderigo, Corregio, (who always rose very late,) on descending to his breakfast-room; was handed a billet from Count Montmoren- cy, requesting the pleasure of his company to dine that day. With a light and bouyant heart, he speedily wrote and despatched his acceptance of the honor, then seated himself to his solitary meal, and devoured with al- most famishing ferocity the food set before him-not indeed from hunger but abstrac- tion; for his thoughts were revelling in his now almost certain success, when he was re- called to his senses by his domestic exclaim- ing: "Why, brese my heart, massa, you no hab noting to eat yesterday, me tink; you hab drink all de coffee, and eat all de bread and butter, but nebber mind, massa, old Nancy- run and get more." "No! no! Nance, that will do-faith, T have made a pretty good meal-I took a short sail in my yacht, yesterday, and you know, Nance, I always have a- devil of an appetite after taken a snuff of the ocean." "' Dat you do-old Nance know dat, massa -yah! yah! yah!" said the good old jade,. as she proceeded to clear decks of the empty dishes; and long after Corregio had taken his hat and sallied out, might have. been heard her 'half-subdued yah i yah! yah! as her merry heart thought of the apparent keen relish with which her master had devoured his morning's meal. At the appointed hour, Corregio found him. self Count AMontmorencyls guest-and after the usual formalities, was seated at the tatJ     beside tne gentle Elizabeth. He could (W hen not embarrassed by the presence of those he thought suspected him) be a dangerous as- sailant of the female heart. On this occa- sion he put forth all his powers and endeav- ored to anticipate Elizabeth's every wish. His winning address. combined with his fund of knowledge, had made great inroads into the good grates of the Count, and his daugh- ter could not hut acknowledge to herself that his conversational powers were pleasing. Stili there was a certain something, half-con- cealed, half-revealed, in those dark eyes of his, which., in spite of herself, seemed to chill her very soul; but again, while view- ing his manly features, seemingly lit up, and watmed with the remembrance of some bea'- tiful spot he had visited and was describing in his own rich and captivating manner, she thought that could Capt. Eggleston see him at such a moment, even he might acknowl- edge himself deceived in his unfavorable opinion of him. The two gentlemen sat over their wine a half hour or so after Eliza- beth had left the table, during which time Corregio failed not to gain somewhat in the Count's good opinion, in which he perceived he was fast making headway. While thus paving the path to the future success of his plans, the Servant came in with a letter for Count Monimorency, who, after reading it, remarked to Count Corregio, that he should be obliged to leave him until the evening as he was under the necessity of taking a short ride on business ; "but," added he, "I flat- ter myself that my daughter will prevent you from suffering ennui in the meantime; so if you please, we will seek'her, and having left you in her charge, I will avail myself of the earliest possible moment of rejoining you." "Do not use haste, sir, on my account, as I am well convinced that the time passed in the company of your fair daughter will fly br t too quickly." Entering the drawing-room they found the object of their searclkat the piano; and her father addressing her, expressed his regret at being obliged to absent himself for a few hours, but .hoped that she would entertain their friend till his return, which he promis- ed should be eftected as speedily as possible. Jount Montmorency having departed, Corre- io begged Elizabeth to favor hin with mu- sic. Now, be it' knwn that Elizabeth was a most skillful pianist, while her companion, though not an instrumental performer, was a passionate admirer of well-executed perform- ances, and naturally gifted with a rich melo- dious voice. It was not possible for the two to be in the same room with a piano without making it discourse in harmony with them- selves; ard Elizabeth's rich soprano, ming- ling with the full, manly tones of Corregio, now rising to the full power of the perform- ers, and anon sinking to low, sweet strains, seemed to form a unison less of earth than heaven. Elizabeth's whole soul was filled with a sweet sadness, for the last time she sang the piece she was accompanied by Ro- ierigo, who had composed for her the plain-    tive air, wh le the language, full of feeling and friendship, was such as might have been dictated by a heart capable of the warmest and most devoted affection. Corregio saw its effect, but attributed it to her natural love for music, which, his vanity suggested, was made more attractive at this time, by the union of his own voice. The gentle girll with moistened eyes, rose from the instru- ment, and excused herself from farther exer- tion, as the evening was so warm ald op- pressive. Corregio, emboldened by the wine he had taken at dinner, and also by the un- doubtedly favorable opinion his musical powers had inspired in the mind of Elizabeth seated himself beside her, and fearing some interruption, most abruptly, but in the most courteous' manner, declared his passion for her, remarking that he felt it impossible any longer to refrain from giving utterance to the emotions with which his heart had been fill- ed from the first moment of meeting her. Now, our fair readers must know that we have a most treacherous memory, beside, deeming it the height of impertinence to take notes on the occasion, and of course are unable to give in detail, all the many tender and pathetic selitiments poured forth by the Italian suitor-let it suffice to remark, that' he said all that might be expected from a per- son under similar circumstances.; but to no avail. Although much embarrassed by the suds denness of the avowal, Elizabeth was so far enabled to control her feelings,-as mildly, but firmly, to, decline the honor of receiving either his heart or hand; she added, that as her father's guest she would always endeavor to make his visits to their house agreeable, but, she must in candor assure him, that he could never expect a nearer connexion. At this moment, in stooping to pick up her far. which had fallen, a locket suspended from her neck disclosed itself, revealing to the eyes of Corregio, the hateful face of his rival. Stung with rage at the sight of the bauble, and filled with mortification at his rejection, Corregio's countenance assumed a most demon-like expression, and, as Eliza- beth raised her eyes and saw its workings, she started back in. amazement and terror. He was on the point of extending his hand to detain her, when the door opened and Count Montmorency entered. Fortunately for the Italian, he was sitting with his face averted from the entrance, and before the Count had advanced into theroom, a con. plete metamorphosis had been effected. Gay and happy smiles had assumed the place of the dark clouds of rage which but a mo- ment before had rendered him so hideous, and in order to give time for Elizabeth's expression of alarm to subside, which Corre- gio well knew would be instantly observed by the Count, and might cause some unpleasant explanations, he hastily rose and hoped he would not seem uncourteous if he declared that his absence seemed very short, so de- lighted had he been with the society and music of his dughter, but he was sorry o   !e that what had been done for his own I hin entertainnant had had such a saddening in- for t uenc e onr her spirit, though he trusted that i her father's return would soon restore her per wonted sprightliness. Elizabeth, who dread- fei ed the consequences that might ensue should fie her parent suspect what had transpired since ret his departure, endeavored to assume a cheer- 'ulness, which, at any other time, Count m Montmorency would have perceived to be sm forced; but ascribing her melancholy smile ol to the effect of the music, he affectionately He embraced her, and bade her banish from her de mind all unpleasant thoughts, ( forito-mor- bl sow, my love," added he, "we embark for da old England, the' land of our nativity, the de home of our hearts."          as "To-morrow, my father!" she replied, we with sparkling eyes and lightened heart; see "O! then, I will indeed be happy!" So say- dr ing, she imprinted a filial kiss on the revered wl cheek of her parent, and pleading the neces- th sity of looking up her moveables, bade the- p' gentlemen good night, and left the apartment. se Tc Corregio, however, this sudden de- of partire, from Kingston was not so pleasant. fo True, he knew that the Count intended soon th to embark for England, but he'had not anti- lo cipated so early a move. He flattered him- a self that they were to remain at least a week T Aonger, and as he had got rid of his rival, he in imagined the coast clear, and his success le certain. The unqualified rejection, this t( evening, of his addresses, had, for a moment, re nonplussed him, out he was too much of a c systematic villain to let such trifles throw c him off the course, when there were wanting s a few more days to mature his plans and f rfrange his mode of attack.       t "I am exceedingly sorry," said he to his s host, "that we are so soon to be deprived of a the society of yourself and amiable daughter, a but I am also well aware that Kingston can:  offer but slight inducement to make you de- E lay one short hour your return to that home t from which you have been so long absent i and to whose shores you naturally look with t anxiety and impatience.  Count Montmorency replie d that they had enjoyed their stay very much, and, were they not leaving it for the land of their birth, should leave Kingston with many regrets. He, however, hoped that they might have the pleasure of extending to himr the hospitali- ties of British hearts anl British cheer, and that he would avail himself of his earliest convenience to make them a visit, as their mansion would always be open to receive him. Cor egio thanked the Count, and assuring him that he would soon avail himself of his kindness, warmly pressed his hand, and with many jervent wishes for his speedy and pleasant passage bade him adieu. What next step to take. he had not yet fully made up his mind. After quitting Count Mont- morency's house, he walked towards his quarters completely absorbed in meditation. At length, starting, as if some new light had oken upon his n ind, " 'es," said he to   himself, "that will do; she will theii have forgotten him. One more cargo of 'olack ivory,' and then for old England; and it. perchance, she is offish,. why, then, a light freight of white ivory," and with the satis- fied air of success, he entered his abode anm retired for the night. "My gorry, Massa Sam, old Caff ennj most run out his log-him back all broke tc smash wid de lobster-coat bayonet-ugh! let old Cuff go make breakfast for de shark. He no. see noting; he most slipped off ot de hooks-Ugh! ugh!" groaned out a pool black, as he was lifted from the boat, one dark night by his shipmates, and laid on the deck of as regular a piratical-looking craft as ever swam the Caribbean Sea. Her crew were composed of almost all nations, and seemed exactly fitted for their trade; their dress, deportment, and in fact, whole exterior. which .exactly corresponded with, and fitted them for their calling, obliging them to use a proper degree of caution in exposing them- selves during the day on shore, the black-flag of their hearts being too plainly perceptible for disguise in their murderous and cut- throat countenances: in fine, y3J could not look upon one of them without the idea of a hempen-cravat- coming up in your mind. The craft, whose crew we have thus flatter- ingly described, fay off Port Royal, half a league from the shore. Her boat had been to Kingston, that afternoon, and was about returning late at night, when, just as she cleared the shore with muffled oars, the boat's crew heard at a short distance from them a splash in the water. They lay on their cars for a short time, and then noiselessly pullet. the boat in the direction from whence the sound proceeded. The bow-oar was shipped, and the oarsman intently engaged in looking ahead to see what had disturbed the stillness i of the night, when, in a few moments, with at - half-subdued whisper, he bade the rest back e their oars, and seizing with his hook a float ing mass, brought'it alongside and throwing' h the light from the side of a dark lantern, the dress and features of the cook of their craft d were revealed to them. As he seemed entire- y ly dead, they were on the point of turning i, him adrift, when he gave a. low moan and 3. began to sink. To see a fellow being die be- e fore them withot-offering to assist him, un- i- less, indeed, to make his exit the more Ctr- d tain and speedy, was what these scoundrels st were quite accustomed to-but the "Doctor" ir was a first rate cook (your regular-built cut- re throats are something of epicures) and to lose him, wkhout an effort on their part to save lg him, was not at all their calculation. So with- is out much ceremony, he was placed in the bot- th tom of the boat, which, with some hearty and id strong tugs at the oar, was in due course of at time, as we have seen, alongside their vessel. de The third Lieutenant, Mr. Neckbreak, the it- officer of the deck, sending for the steward, is who officiated as surgeon, that important n. personage made his appearance, with banda- ad ges and lint, and all the necessary paraphe  to nalia of his office. Upon examiaing tin     wound, it was decided to be all but useless to dress it, a3 it would be impossible for the sufferer to survive long. It was, however done, while the crew crowded around with bull-dog-looking sympathy; and with many '.mprecations on the hand which had thus de- rived them of his valuable services, (for we epeat that your au fait pirate is a gentleman of the most approved bon vivantschool,) they earnestly inquired, of poor old Cato, the cir- cumstances of the accident. i' Me know noting bout him, cep' ldat arter I leabe de boat. tinks I, old'Cato gro see Miss Dinah. Well den, I cut stick across old massa Donaldson's plantation, and berry much afraid dat I meet old massa; bam-bye I see he d-d old red nose, and he sing out, 'who dat?' I say, ' debbil hab him, see old Cato's heels minit,' and den I hide so I can't find myself, and massa come and stand close by me and say, 'he dam brack debbil. sure nuff' den he smell brimstone match and den he run. Yah'! yah! ugh! uh! old Cato full ob snappin' turtle!"And here the poor old fellow was forced to stop in his narrative to give utterance to a few groans, wrung from him by the pain of his wound. In a few minutes, b(ing more. easy, he continued: "Well, arter massa gone, I say to myself, Cato why for you no run todder way? Well den I poke round in de inud and find myself, den I run, old debbil heself no catch me, and no stop till I find myself in lublv Dinah's arms." "And then the black jade stabbed you, eh Cato?" said one of his hearers. "No! no, massa Sam-Dine hab heart  soft as candle grease-she no kill dead galli-  nipper, no, no! She say, why bress my  heart, why for you out of breef so, my dear I brack Cato?  Den I tell her I so glad t to see her, I not hab time to breafe. In E few minit she set table, and put on fried i plantains, and nice hot hoe-cake, and some i genewine jamaky-and I tell her I come to c ask her to cept my hand and heart, and be c my lubly Mrs. Cato, and den she covered t her blushes wid de table-cloth and fall on de o floor and spire dead wid lde sudden dewelope- s ment of de notions of my heart. I tun and v get de fry-pan, and fan her gently, and put c a few drops of possum-fat on de table-cloth, d and when she smell de grateful fumes she s start up and say, Cato, where dat you gwine? o I say, oh! my precious, lubly Dine, old Cato ti tink he kill you and his heart noting but  brack mud wid grief. Den Dine's eyes shine i more as brack battle, and she say, Dine lib so only for Cato. Well den, to cut off de brevia- e ttons of my story, gwine to find de parson to e tie us togedder, and jess as I pass de house s] if de grand Cpnnt Montmorency, Gor Al- s mighty, fuss ting I know me find old Cato .d in dte ribber wid dis dam hole in he's back, i and dat de hole of de affair."     t So saying, poor Cato laid his head back  on the deck and fainted-they were about con- hi signing him again to the water when he re- H vived, and having dressed his wounds and  giving him some spirits they bore him to his o smt, where we will leave him for, the present.   e       CHAPTER XI. h  The third morning aftet leaving her place y of rendezvous found the Meteor enveloped in !- a thick, and almost impenetrable fog. So e dense was the mist, in which thev were?a- n shrouded, that Splinters swore to his mess- y mates, that the ocean had " evapticated," - and that they were sailing in the vapors.: but Bobstay insisted upon it, it was not va. r por with which thev were surrounded, but s "smoke impregnicated with the prescription d of the ocean, sublunarized by the action of carbuncles and ox hides above, effersovescing downwards."  Now Bobstay was considered , somewhat of a scholar aflong his messmates, I inasmuch as he had attended the parish school one winter, from which, after having kissed all the girls and flogged the Dominie, he ran away and shipped on board a man-o'- war, lying at Portsmouth. His liberal edu- cation made him him umpire'in all discus- rsions' of this kind among his mess, beside that in this particular his opinion was back- ed by Bill Crosstrees, who asserted that he could plainly perceive that it was smoke, for it smelt like the fumes from the pipe of Myn- heer, the flying Dutchman, "and shiver my timbers, messmates, if that ere feller aint been on this tack within four and twenty hours." But whether the carbuncles and ox-hides had got underneath the matter in dispute and were efersovesfing back again, or whether the sun had made his breakfast on that portion of it which ballasted and kept in on an even keel, we have not yet as- certained, but certain it is, that about two bells, (9 o'clock,) the veil of mist with which they had been so closely surrounded, began, slowly and heavily, to rise and curl itself up in thick black folds, revealing to their aston- ished gaze a man-of-war brig within hailing distance on the weather-beam. At the sight of a stranger in such proximity to them, and that stranger an armed vessel too, the crew of the Meteor flew to their posts as the drum, simultaneously with that on board the other vessel, beat to quarters. Boarding-pikes, cutlasses, pistols, muskets, match-tubs, pow der and ball, were quickly arranged for in- stant use, and so perfect was the discipline on board the schooner, that in three minutes time every man was at his post, fully equip- ped and ready for immediate action. Roder- igo was on the quarter deck, glass in hand, scrutinizing the stranger with a rapid and experienced eye that took in at a glance everything visible appertaining to her-hull, spars, rigging and force. Meanwhile, his scrutiny was returned by the other comman- der, a tall, handsome man, of light complex- ion. a sprightly light-blue eye, and a form that combined strength with' activity; in short, one -whose whole appearance bespoke him a thorough seaman and a gentleman. His vessel was a long, low, rakish-looking craft, 'mountingeighteen brass guns, with a bong brass pivot-gun amidships. After eyeing the Meteor for a few minute   through his glass, he dropped the instrument d to his side, which as followed by the dis-  charge o, a gun to windward and. the unfold- ing at his peak of the " star spangled banner," . of the United States. Roderigo ordered his own flag to be displayed, and rounding to, f hailed the American, inquiring his name, \ destination, &c., who replied, that the vessel X he had the honor to command was the Ameri- i can privateer, Wave; that he had important s information to communicate' to him; if  agreeable, would be happy to see him on 1 board the privateer; and if he would allow  him the honor, would send hi, first Lieuten-  ant in the barge for him. Roderigo thank- ed him for his politeness and could not think of troubling him to send his barge, but would come on board withhis own boat. Ordering Roberto to keep a sharp lookout, he descend-  ed the side, and bidding the men shove off, was in a few moments on the deck of the privateer, where he was met by Capt. S--, who introduced himself and remarked at the. same time, "I believe I have the honor of addressing Capt. Roderigo, of the Meteor." Roderigo bowing, replied, "I have the honor to command the Meteor, am called Roderigo, and at your service, sir." Capt. S-- then leading the way, request- ed the pleasure of his guest's comhpany in the cabin, where they remained closeted in ear- nest conversation a long while; during which time Roderigo was informed that his  deeds of daring had been heard of by the people of. the United States, and that the ob- ject of the Wave's cruise was to fall in with him and deliver him some public documents, (which were handed him) and to urge his as- sent to the contents. -Breaking, the seal of the evetope, (which was addressed-To Capt. Boderigo, Commander of the armed vessel, called the Meteor,) he hastily perused the pa- pers and replied, that although he felt him- self undeserving the high. enconiums so pro- fusely lavished upon him, still it would afford him the highest gratification to devote his humble efforts to the attainment of the object desired, and that Capt. S--- might bear back his thanks for the honor conferred, and his unqualified assent to the wishes expressed in the documents, and the assurance that his utmost endeavors should be used in aiding to the best of his ability the parties front whom they emanated. Capt. --, with the gen- erous warmth of a sailor, shook him heartily by the hand, and congratulated the party upon this accession. After some lew further remarks, Roderigo rose to take leave, but Capt. S--, whose well-known hospitality / on ship-board never suffered a guest to quit his vessel without partaking of hit good cheer, bade hil, be seated until his steward should bring in some refreshments, which he had ordered for the occasion; and, touching the bell, a tray of sundry good tiings made their appearance, to which the two comman- ders did ample justice. A fne breeze now springing up, Roderigo bade adieu to his frieiDj and, throwing himself into his boat was in a few moments on his own quarter- .  '^          .     deck. The Meteor, filling away, was again on her course with all sail set, while the American wore ship and stood to the west- ward. The Britannia, after taking her passengert from the Meteor, continued, as we have said her south easterly course. The following morning was one of those bright, soul-reviv- ing mornings-not unfrequent at sea after a storm-in which the elements seem to vie with each other in endeavors to make the poor wanderer on the mighty deep, forget his past hardships in the enjoyment of present, and, inspite of himself, heart-cheering beau- ties. The air was fresh and invigorating, yet soft and balmy as Araby's sweetest 'breezes, penetrating the inmost soul, filling it with joy and gladness, and causing the heart to expand with emotions like those we ina- gine to fill the bosoms of angels in their celestial abode. O! who of God's creatures, what wretched inhabitant of earth has not at some time inhaled such atmosphere, amid the hills and valleys of mother earth or on the trackless ocean? The sky-how shall we describe that rich canopy that over- hang their heads, in which the eye seemedcto penetrate almost to heaven's own portals? Far in the western horizon, its hue was of the deepest and purest blue-overhead, it was slightly bronzed with the golden rays of, the rising sun-eastward, it presented a scene beyond the power of pen or pencil to portray. The bright and joyous god of day just emerging from his watery couch, burnishing the sky with his golden beams, blending and intermingling with its own rich and spotless purity of blue, seemed to shine more brightly than his wont, as he gazed on the magnifi- cent scene.-The ocean, partaking of the in- spiration of the glorious and unclouded morning, slightly rippling with the gentle breeze, seemed all alive with joy and glad- ness in each individual, sparkling drop, as i. kissed the sides of the noble barque. Elizabeth had been for sometime seated quietly and silently on the quarter-deck, drinking in with ecstatic delight and yet with sweetly saddening and softening eno- i tions, the splendors of the scene. The little ;boy was in her lap, his dark ringlets hang- ing in rich flusters about his neck and X shoulders, one tiny hand clasped in hers, the -, other resting in his lap, and his open, inno- ; cent countenance uptuined to hers with r thoughtful, wondrous gaze, as he beheld the : emotion of his adopted mother. Insensibly t h the countenance of the child assumed the ex- r pression of Elizabeth's, the same bright drops t filled his little sparkling eyes, his heart I throbbed, and with an effort to climb up to her I face, he said, "Why does mamma cry?" e Elizabeth turned to the beautiful child and encountering his sympathetic gaze, the pear- e 'y drops fell from her eyes on his head, while - she convulsively pressed him to her bosom. r Ere she could sufficiently compose herself to s speak to him,the officer, whom Roderigo had ,saved from the wreck of the Indtaman, made -his appearance on deck.     He was a tall, well-built man, with high, broad forehead--rich, dark, intelligent eye, urjnounted by thick and finely arched black eyebrows; and a mouth, which, though seen in repose, seemed speaking, while his whole countenance looked weather-beaten, and a deep scar on his right cheek, bespoke one who had "seen service." There was that too, in his hollow cheek and saddened eye, which spoke of recent and present mental Suffering. With mind abstracted he ascended the. deck, and, ere he was aware of another's pres- ence, stood before Elizabeth. He was on the point of turning aside with the compli- ments of the morning, when the child having turned round at his approach their eyes met, and with the cry of " blessed God, my child!" and "papa!" father and son were locked in one long embrace. The pent-up feelings of the father's heart now burst the barriers that had confined them, and raising the child high aloft in his sinewy arms, with eyes up- turnel to heaven, while scalding tears cour- sed his manly cheeks, he cried with suffoca- tiag voice, "my God, I thank thee that thou hast restored to me this precious treasure. this adorable image of his dead mother--" and with a convulsive sob, he bowed his head upon his boy and pressed him to his heart. Yes! the warrior, the man of iron nerves. he who had unflinchingly faced danger and death in almost every form, now, in the pres- ence of woman, wept like a child! Oh, who would not then have wept! Who that has buried a loved partner of his joys and sorr rows, whose very soul seemed interwovh with his own, whose smile created in is heart unutterable joy, and whose loss fIs his soul with that wearying, sickenihg void which words have never yet been found ade- quate to express-who that has sustained such a misfortune, and believes that with her has faded the tender blossom, the laugh- ter-lovlng, rosy-cheeked prattler, the gift of a kind and indulgent God, the tie that bound their hearts with cords of keenest affection- and while he bleeds at every pore with the agony of desolateness, suddenly finds re stored to him one of his treasures, his idoliz- ed child, ruddy with health and blight with innocent delight, who would not Weep the tears of mingled joy and anguish? Oh! what a flood of crowding, contending emo- tions would fill the soul of such a parent while folding his beloved offspring to his heart! joy, in its wildest' delirium, for the recovery of one so dear, would strive for ut- terance, while the bitter reflection that she, whose blessed image seemed speaking from the countenance of her child-she whose presence seemed necessary to his own exist- once--was irrecoverably gone, would gnaw  upon his heart'; core and fill it with anguish inexpressible! Oh, then. what a. blessed re-  def are tears. How they soothe the feelings, cool the burning eyes, calm the aching heart,  and light the soul to God-how resigning their influencep;-how they remove the bars  that fetter reason's throne-how they urchain    the mind from bitter, corroding misery ani teach us to confide in Him who " doth nom willingly afflict the children of men?"' Then let not any deem it unworthy man to weep, for God, who knows that the full heart would burst unless relieved of its pent-up agony, in mercy for the sufferings which He sees our nature could not bear, sends his messengers of comfort and straightway the fountain which was scorched and dried within us, bursts forth, sweeping away in its resistless flood all that is bitter and agonizing, stilling the troubled soul and pouring healing balm into the wounded heart. i This extreme excitement, however, the officer soon subdued, and nothing, he said to Elizabeth, but the sudden recognition ot his beautiful boy, whom, with his mother, he be. lieved to be sleeping beneath the briny. wave, nothing but this unexpected meeting with one of them, and that one the perfect image, in miniature, of the other, could have so un- manned him. "And now, madam,' added he, "permit me to inquire ho'w you came in possession of the dear boy, and also what you know of the fate of his mother?"Hav- ing seated himself beside her. the child with his tiny grasp laying fast bhI of her sieeve, Elizabeth krecounted all th- particulars of his rescue from the wreck, and the exclamation of the mother as she sank beneath the wave. The officer groaned aloud-"My God! to think of that poor woman holding to the bot- tom of a vessel and supporting this child too, amid the fury of the sea; while I, strong and -muscular, could give her no assistance. Oh! might I have reached them, these bones should have been battered to atoms ere I would relinquish my treasures! Alas, my poor Maria! I only snatched you from one watery grave to carry you to another-you suffered much in this life, and I trust God will not forget the meekness and resignation with which you bore it, and though we may not meet again oi earth, still I will live with the blessed hope of joining you in heaven!- I feel, madam," he said, turning to Eliza- beth, ",too much-gratitude for your kindness to my child ever to be expressed in the cold formality of language; I shall only say I shall cherish it to the last' momentof my existence." Elizabeth's sympathetic heart had drank too deeply of the tide of joy and sorrow, which had flowed out before her, to permit her to reply-but her look told the stranger that she was too happy in being in- strumental in relieving the sufferings of a fellow being, to need thanks for the little at- tention she had been enabled to show the boy. After a while, she said: "You mentioned just now, sir, that you had on a former occasion saved your lament- ed wife from death-if you should not deem it impertinent curiosty which prompts the request, and if the recital would not give you pain, I should like to hear that portion of her history." "So far from causing offence or giving me pain, madam, I can assure you it would af. ford me much pleasure to speak uf her I   tell know the kindness of your heart will, resul make due allowance if I dwell somehatreas bng on her memory, or trespass too much confi apon your time in the narration. "'"My wife was the only daughter of Lord duce and Lady ay Wallaceof London. At the four e' Tf fourteen she had the misfortune to lose st her fa)her. Lady Mary who almost idolized from hetusband, never entirely recovered from side the shock-but blest with two children, Ala- seize ria and Robert.

This person happened she be his commaiding officer On what proved, the both parties, a short cruise. Previous, bt however, to their saililbg, a ball was given nol on shore to the officers ofthe ship, which was gu attended by Maria and Robert, as well as ala Commodore -- H.'  n 'the course of the ro evening, the Commodoej who had been dan- to ting with Maria, seated himselflbeside her,  his breath strongly impregnated with wine. c In the .conversation hich ensued between s them, he made some remarks which severel t tWounded the feelings of the poor girl. Her  brother, seeing her look distressed, hastened r to her side and affectionately inquired the yr cause. Well knowing the result, should she give him the true reason, she atributedit to o the closeness of the apartment, and taking st hiis arm walked to the -ithdrawing-rooIm. ta Boon regaining her composure, she return,  to the dancing hall and strove for the remain- t der of the evening, and, as she then thought, r effetually, to appear as -though nothing had  transpired to interrupt her enjoyment; but  Circiumstances occurred sopn after the dpar- i ture of the ship, which led 'her to suppoe st that her brother must have suspected sore- c thing wrong and by some means have found p but the real motive of her uneasiness. A r ressel arrived at Portrsmouth bearing des-  patches to the Admniralty from Comnadore n -  , stating, that, when twenty days out,c  tieutenant Wallace had endeavored to raise t t mutiny on board, had struck his comm an- ter and after much difficulty was secured-- that tne next nigh, having bribed thearines e diuty, with the assistance of some of the Sean:en he made his esi:ape, in one of the ship's boats, leaving a letter to his comman- der, (which has since poved a forgery,) sta- tiig that he should enter the naval service af the enemies of his country, and caution- *ng him to beware his vengeance should they ,ver meet. The ietter was so perfect a copy at his hand-wiiting, and the signature, which was. pecul'iar to him, so well executed, that his mother and the couicil employed for him, were ,mipelled to aakna'wledae it his. The   result was, that he was pronouned 'gilty et treason, declared an outlaw, and his property  confiscated. Not content with the misery already pro- duced, his enemy returned to London about four months afterward, and one dark and stormy night sent a band of ruffianly fellow from his vessel to the house were Maria re- sided, who succeeded in finding admittance, seized and gagged her, bearing her hastily to the river. After several hours hard row; ing they stopped alongside a schooner-rigged vessel, on board of which she was immediate- ly lifted and carried to the cabin. During all this time her sensations can be more easi  ly conceived than expressed; she did not faint--and hoped that by mastering her feel- i ngs and keeping quiet she might be' able yet to elude their villiany. When carried below, great was her astonishment at finding herself 'in the presence of Commodore ----, her f brother's late commander. For a momen. ! she suppbsed the villians had mistaken their vessel-for althcugh she believed her b brother's enemy stood before her, she-could a not'believe that this same enemy would be s guilty of such high-handed infamy. But s alas! she soon found herself painfully in er- e ror, for when on the point of addressing hi m - to ask restoration to her home, and to corn- r, plain of the savage treatment she had r- e. ceived, she was stopped short, and almost n struck dumb with astonishment and indigna- y tion, when the villian, with a malignant er smnile, approached her, exclaiming, "Well, d  my -pretty bird, you are safely caged now and he your warblings shall serve to. drive away the he einnui of a sea-passage." Maria was seated to on a couch on one side of the table, which ig stood in the centre of the cabin, and on this n. table lay a pair of loaded pistols. As he ad- ed. vanced towards her with an eye full of mean- n- irg, her nature seemed to change with the ht, rapidity of the lightnint's flash-her mold tad and gentle spirit became that of a determined, mut desperate man -those bright and gentle eyes ar- in which nought but love and gentle kindness we seemed to repose, now dilated and shot glan- re- ces of fire--those lips, around which a smile nd' pirpetiially' gambolled, were now tightly com- A pressed-while her deep blue veins, through es- which 'the current of life was wont to flow ore peacefully, swelled with painful intenseness, ut, as woman's' roused and outraged spirit forced Lise the proud and untarnished blood of her an- an- cestors through its channels to her heart - Commodore      cowered beneath those nes glances and insensibly recoiled from' her the seat: but remembering that nothing but a the detenceless woman confronted him, the in- tan- suiting seoundrel, said, as he again approach- sta-' ed, "Nay, my pretty warbler must not ruffle vice its feathers so, and put on such naughty ion- looks ; it will soon get accustomed to like its they cage and sing me sweet lullabys-my lihle :opy bird is frightened-come to my arms-" hich Here Maria hastily seized the pistols, 'and that with a resolute voice, said, as she pointed him, cne of them at his breast: The  "'Wretch appr t*ch not one stel rearer m,     1r, as sure as there is a God in heaven, I will fire. You no longer see il amethe weak, defenceless woman, but the roused spirit of the Wallaces--one who is determinedto re- lent her own wrongs and her brother's if lneed be." But disregarding her threat, he was in the act of laying his hands on her, when the pis- tol flashed, and simultaneous with its report he measured his length on the cabin floor The vessel on board which these events occurred was a small clipper-built, rakish- looking schooner of about one hundred tons with an armament of seven brass pieces and a complement of twenty-five men beside Com- medore ---  , its commander and owner; ar I two lieutenants. The first lieutenant Mr. Hardy, was a man of herculean strength and spirit to use it on all proper occasions He had been entirely ignorant of the purport of the boat's absence (being on shore at the time she left the vesseD but after her return,  he saw the lady lifted to the deck; and on demanding of the men what they had got a there, he was told they were acting in obedi- s ence to their commander's orders. Sufier- v ing her to be carried to the cabin, he seem- f ingly thought no more of the matter-but u not so in reality. Hardy had too much of e ' the real sailor's feelings about him, too much n of the true "old salt" in his nature--to per- e 'mit even a detenceleds man to he injured in h his presence, but to wrong a woman-" love- w ly, dear little craft of a woman, to be injur- tI ed by a man, anti Jhck Hardy stand by and suck his fingers like a puling baby, bloody-  bones, never!   , muttered he, as he ground  his teeth, folded his arms with a hug that f would have pulverized a rock, and paced fore de and aft the deck of the schooner, which was er got under weigh, immediately on the boat's  coming aboard, agreeably to previous orders .o of the commander to Mr. Hardy. Whiie th continuing his walk, chaffing and fretting s that the garments of man were disgraced by as such a tenant as Commodere t., and reby volving in his mind what course would be the best for him to pursue to frustrate the con- r templated villany, he accidentally overheard eff some conversation among  a group of the cu crew  seated on the fore-top-gallant deck,  which induced h   4 n to pay more attention to no the remainder of their story, and in order to decl aol the appearance of listening, he stooped pit and appealed busty  engaged in examining his the tackle of one of the guns. The group, Lie consisted solely of those who were ce"cerned halr in kidnapping Maria from her home--.ad it coul may be well to stale here, for the satisfacL:on on E at any shipmate who perchance may fall in to t9 with these pages, that the boat's crew were soon ticked up for this especial purpose, and were ed t neither sailors nor landsmen-but a kind of ea mongrel concern whose habits and pursuits e were congenial with these transactions. her   Hardy soon heard enough to make him  acquainted with tie whole affair, and was res on the point of going up to them and remov- sailo hig the deck's stain, by pitching them into any  -he wa, when he checked himself and walked, impu   en, I aft, under the inflience )I an idea that a weak, the moment came to his mind. Having ex. tit of amined the pistols in his belt, and thrown a to re- hasty glance at the hilt of his cutlass, to 's if make sure of its being at his command on the instant, he stationed himself on the n the quarter-declk; the skylight had been partially pis- removed to admit a free circulation oI' air in port, the cabin, which enabled him to hear the )r.  least sound that might occur below. Hardly rents had he reached the place, when the excited dish- tone of Maria's voice, ordering his Corn.. tons, mander not to advance, fell upon his ear.-- and A moment-and he was at the companion. lom- way, and heard the report bf the pistol. The ner; cabin doors were closed ahd fastened; bus ant, bolts and bars were of little avail' when gth, Hardy wanted passage, and with one thrust Ons. of his foot, the splinters flew in every dire.. port tion, and he stood in the presence of Maria, the who sat stupified and motionless, with the urn, discharged pistol still elevated in her hand. on  The noise had also brought into the cabin, got and at Hardy's heels, the men whose crrver- di- sation he had overheard, the. foremost of ier- whom seeing his commander lying on 'the im- floor of the cabin weltering in blood, and the but upraised pistol still in Maria's hand, levell- of ed his own at her head, and the next mo- ch ment her tr6ubles would have been forever er- ended, had not the drawn sword in Hardy's in hand sent it to the other side of the cabin, ve- while the ball lodged in one of the beams in r- the side of the vessel. nd "What in the devil's name are you at, you ly- lubberly son of a gun! fire at a woman? nd you dirty, mean-souled apology for a man! at flow dare any of you come aft without or- re ders?   Go forward all of you this instant m, as exclaimed Hardy, and perceiving that- at the 's moment they were not disposed to obey his rs orders, and  were muttering something to ie themselves-"You wofn't, hey t you grease gIt spots of humanity  by my soul, we'll see!6 y and seizing two of them (one in each hand) - by the slack of their waisthands, he used le them as weapons of defence. on the remain- L- dr; their 'arms and legs, in their f'uitless d efforts to escape his giant grip, kicking and cuffing  their comrades in no very fentle , manner, which soon induced the blooay- ) nosed scoundrels to beat a retreat to the decks, (while Hardy, to ace lerate their flight, pitched in among them  the two he held in his grasp,) where they were met by the 2d ) Lieutenant and the rest of the crew, who having learned, from one of them a fth ac- count of their agency in bringing the lady on board, had determined among thems elves to take her part at the first opportunity. As soon then as the squad from the cabin reach. ed the deck, they were 'deprived of their weapons and safely confined in the hold.- Hardy now addressed. Maria, and assured her of his protection, telling her to make her mind easy, and that she should be safely restored to her friends, and with a true sailor's reluctance to witness the display of any gratitude for that which the generoum impulses of his soul- taught him to consido( tocos   othing more than an ac. of duty, turned to ascertain what was the fate of the prostrate Commodore.  Finding him insensible, he raised and placed him upon a couch on the Other side of the cabin, and removing his. coat and vest, proceeded to examine his wound, which proved to be less serious than he thought would have been the case had he fired the pistol; as it was, however, it was far from being trifling- the ball having broken his collar-bone and lodged in his right shoulder, sufficiently deep to cause him to know it was there, and serve to remind him of the occasion of its visit. With the assist- ance of Maria, he was speedily restored to his senses, and his wounds dressed, when tiardy lifted him in his arms, and depositing him carefully in the berth of his private, %tate-room, informed him of the necessity of his remaining quiet--calling a servant to stay by his master, and, should he need further assistance, to ring the bell. Return- ing to Miaria, he conducted her to a separate cabin, and urging the necessity of her taking some rest, handed her the key of the door, that she might secure it on the inside; and renewedly assuring her that she might place the fullest confidence in his ability and de- termination to protect her from any further annoyance, he commended her to refreshing slumbers, and retired to the deck. Indeed Hardy's open, manly countenance, and the treatment which she had seen the boat's crew receive from the rest of the men, had fully convinced her that she had nothing farther to fear from their commander; but the recollection of the terrible scenes which she had so recently and rapidly encountered, now that she had no cause to nerve herself against them, completely overpowered her, and as she lay her head upon her pillow, she burst into tears and wept like a child, till tired,'exhausted nature, was steeped in gentle forgetfulness. CHAPTER XII. When Hardy reached the deck, he found the schooner scudding before a westerly gale of wind. To come to an anchor or attept to make a port was deemed impracticaie, the night being, very dark, the sea running high and the wind blowing furiously-the schooner was, therefore, kept on her course, in hope that when daylight should appear the gale would abate, or they would be ena- bled, with less risk, to bear up for some place of safety. But before dawn, the wind, instead of showing any indications of lulling, seem- ed to blow with redoubled fury; and, about four in the nlorning, the vessel suddenly broached to and was thrown'-on her beam ends. Hardy and Mr. Cassel, the second officer, were seamen who in point of nautical skill, decision and coolness, in times of emer- gency, would rank second to none in their profession; the crew too-bold and fearless 'ars, were of su:h a mould as would seem to'   warrant security; no indications of fear were seen in their honest, weather-beaten faces- but springing to execute the several orders of Hard:, in an instant the weather-lanyards were cut, and .the tall, unsupported spars snapped like pipe-stems, while the schooner, relieved of her masts, rose, to an even keel. Having got the vessel once more before the wind, and leaving Mr. Cassel to rig up a small spar to the stump of the foremast, to which a spare topsail was secured, Hardy retired to the cabin to ascertain how it fared with the lady. Fortunately she was on the leeward side when the vessel was thrown down, and had suffered no other inconveni- ence than being rather suddenly awakened by rolling from the bottom to the side of her berth. To Hardy's inquiries, she replied, that she was very. comfortable, and on his assurance that there was no immediate dan- ger, she composed herself again to sleep, first addressing a short but fervent petition to that God who had thus far shielded her, that He would continue His all-powerful protec- tion and Succor. Hardy now sought the quarters of his commander, who from being on the windward side of the- vessel was thrown " sans ceremonie" out into the cabin, capsizing his servant in his descent (thereby in a degree breaking his falD and both roll ing together, with rather unwonted familiar ity, to leeward. When Hardy entered the cabin, Commodore---- was endeavoring tc adjust his dress with the object of ascending the deck; but upon Hardy's telling him that everything possible wasdone and doing, and well knowing that he and Cassel were every way competent to save the whole of them- if mortal arm could avail-he seated himself on a coich, and no persuasion could induce him again to seekI his berth. His mind was very far lrom being at ease. During his short and feverish slumbers, horrible dreams had disturbed his fancy. His past career had not been such that overhauling the log could afford any satisfaction-on the contra- ry every page contained some damning blot which he would have given all he possessed to be able to erase. Dwelling os these dark spots of his life, his mind became tilled with gloomy forbodings of evils; and in his broken, uneasy slumbers, he dreamed that a huge shark came strutting into his -ca bin on his tail, walked up to his berth, and with a display of horrible teeth, politely bow ed and asked him if he was ready to confess he, then, was followed by a porpoise, whe came tumbling in, rolling end over end, till he reached the berth, when, popping his cold, slimy, ill-favored head, close to the cheek oi the horror-stricken man, he breathed out, in the gentle accents of a horses snort, "con- fess!"-Then followed the dolphin, with swift diagonal approaches until he shot alongside; giving his ears a flourish with his tail as he rounded to, and plumped him- self flat on the poor man's'reast, while the mouths of man and fish weie still in close juxtapositior, he extended his jaws, and with a most andolphinlike yawn, demanded     if he was "ready to confess."- All of them then retiring to .he middle of the cabin and joining hands (fins, we should aav,) commen- cedAdancing, and singing a song, whose ,ur- ken seemed, "So merry we'll all. be.? But the song and the dance were rather abruptly terminated for tie time being, by the uncere- monious entrance of a whale, whose huge, wall-sided head, capsized the dancing trio, in its passage to the head of the unfortunate man. There arrived, his whaleship gave the un- derpart of it a thump, which seemed to send its trembling occupant mast-head high, and spouting over him some of old ocean's cool- est, deepest streams, bellowed out, "Confess you lubber," and disappeared with their por- poise-'ship, shark-ship, and dolphin-ship, all seated on his back, and singing-"So merry we'll all be," while the Commodore was awakened from hi; dream by finding himself rolling to leeward. This and other no less agreeable fancies of a mind ill at ease, had harassed him so much that he was deter- %nined, in one particular at least, to quiet this conscience, and take the advice of his visitors; he therefore begged Hardy to re- turn to him as soon as he had seen every- thing secure on deck. This detained him for a few minutes only, and he reported to his commander as he returned to the cabin that daylight was just dawning,-that they were about up with Shippley Island, and  should the wind, which had hauled round to the north, hold in its present quarter, he was 1 in hope to make the port of Calais; but he s feared that it would chop round to the north- t east, and unless it moderated very much, S they would have to keep away before it: t however, he assured him that everything in v their power should be done to prevent danger. The servant having placed writing materials on the table, left the apartment, when Com- S modore -    informed Hardy that, having d unpleasant forebodings, he was extremely h desirous to unburthen his mind of a weight d that pressed heavily upon it, and that he t would do him a favor if he would take paper and copy what he should dictate to him. e He then stated in substance what I have be- e: fore related to you, Madame, concerning his d ill-treatment of Lieut. Wallace, Maria's b brother; and also, that by dint of a heavy li bribe, he had induced a young marine (who w was an excellent penman, and had formerly d( been engaged as clerk in a mercantile house, t but owing to his dishonest practices had st been obliged! to quit,) to counterfeit the hand- ai writing of the Lieutenant, which resulted in g( the :etter admitted as such conclusive evi- pi dence against him. .He added, also, that he th considered it due to the character of his late st Lieutenant to state, that he had grossly and pe Intentionally insulted him, and that by re- he tenting it as he did on the spot, he considered ar lAr. Wallace followed the promptings of a th t ghly honorable and sensitive mind, and th trusted, if he was yet alive, this confession ad might be the means of r storing him to his he met well-deserved rank and station; and bu   em wound up by sincerely askirg his forgivness nd and that of his sister for his unmanly treat n- ment of both of them. Having revised what r- Hardy had written, he bade him call Mr. ut Cassel for a moment, to witness .his signa- ly ture, which having been duly affixed, Hardy e- was requested to take the paper, and after e, they had landed (should they ever be able to in do so) give it into Maria's possession. He te then requested hin to send his servant, a he would no longer risk the lives of all on - board by depriving them of his valuable ser- d vices on deck. d  The first Lieutenant found his fears but - too well grounded. It was now broad day; s, .the wind had chopped round to ,the north- - east, and was still blowing heavy, with the 1 tall cliffs that line the coast from Long Nose y buoy to Cliff End for a lee shore, while the s schooner; working and straining, was run- f ning close hauled. In reply to a question s from Hardy, Mr. Cassel thought it very i doubtful if they should be able to weather - the North Fore-Land, the wind heading them t much. Hardy descended (after a rapid sur- s vey of the prospect) and informed his coin- -mander of their situation, who immediately. - though with some difficulty, ascended to the i deck. He then lnocked at the door of Ma- ria's cabin, telling her she had better rise , as there was some little danger, but that he was: satisfied in giving her this timely notice, he would not cause her any unnecessary alarm, being well convinced from what he had seen of her decision of character, that she would nerve herself to bear with forti- tude any trial which Providence might as- sign her. Having learned from him the ex- tent of their danger at present, she said she would endeavor to deserve the conpliment paid her. Hardy then left her, with' the as- surance that the moment h considered her safer on deck, he would call her; then or dering the men in the hold to be released, as he found the schooner had sprung aleak, he descended with a few of the crew to ascer- tain its location, and if possible to stop it. After groping round among some fifty empty puncheons (the purport of whose pres- ence on board was a mystery to him) it was discovered that the schooner had started a butt on each side the stern below the water- line, through which- the water rushed in with great force. Having called all hands down, that could with safety be spared from the deck, he ordered some few of- them  to stuff into the crevices old clothes, oakumn and such odds and ends as could readily be got at; the remainder, to cut small square pieces of tarred canvass and nail them over the bungs of the hogsheads;, l5ut the watei still gained on them fast and they were com pelled precipitately to retire to the deck. The hatches were then put on and battered down and Iour of the cannon. securely lashed to them. Hardy now turned his attention to the cabin; the dead lights were secured and additional lashings firmily applied to all the heavy moveables. In having the schooner built for him, Commodore ---  had (from   a natural diead ot salt water) taken peculiar I care to have the cabin -made as water-tight as possible. The bulk-head, separating the th cabin from the-hold, was composed of strong t closely-fittifng timbers, whose crevices were ra packed with oakum, and then. the entire sur- face covered with a .thick coating of tarred  felt, aver which was laid grooved plank firm- a ly spitsed to the timbers. The floor and sides of the cabin were also built in the le same manner, making it alrmost a matter of of impossibility for water to find entrance there, unless down the companion or through the fr sky ight: and over the latter, Hardy secured to i-ts planked and covered hatch. Having pre- a pared, for the worst, he now, with a seaman's e rapid, but experienced eye, surveyed the a scene around him. The high, toweiing cliffs under their lee, h with their whited and frowning heads, fear- fully beckoned them on, while the mad surges n were lashing themselves into fury in, their d impatience to engulph them. The sea-gull, with wild and rapid sweeps, cutting the air h in frenzied and curving flight, seemed scream- a ing their requiem; the cross-chop sea--en- gendered by opposing wind--was covered t with foam, and in its angry, tumultuous, ir- e regular tossings, threatened .every moment to baffle the skill of the intrepid mariners. Hardy and/Cassel now had command of the helm, and were guiding the schooner in r herwild and fearful flight, with her course as nigh the wind's eye as these daring sons of Neptune could jam hier. The little bark, th6ugh fast drinking in the waters. of death  sobly kept her course, dashing high aloft with her prow the angry and contending waves.  Large masses of closely-packed, double-headed clouds, with foamy, white, :raggeal'edged tops, (rendered still more daz- zlihng by the rays of the uprising sun, and' the -contrast of Heaven's deep blue vault, which skirted their sides,) thickly studded the sky  -their 'black -and gloomy looking bases making them fit thrones for the storm-spirits -whose shriekings fillel the blast. Ever and anon, spme towering, bfoamy-crested wave with wild, impetuous career, wsuld rash upon them with seemin a nnihilation in its  look, when the deep, manly tones of Hardy voice would be heard high above the roarin- of the tempest; n "H old on all " while the iron-framed tars with giant grasp; would seize upon. any secure hold that first offered' itself. All hope- of freeing .the schooner from the leak having fled, -the pumps were aban- doned and all hands proceededto lash themr Se ve! to various parts of the vessel-with the exception of the boat's crew before men tioned, the commander, .Hardy, and Cassel the two latter being protected .in a great measure by a strong bulkhead which nearl surrounded the wheel. The .boat's crew had been for some time enraged in close and' ;earnest conversation, wlh eyes stretched in anxious gaze towards the lee-shore, and their white-livered hearts in their throats; their -ile and frightened countenances being an uraest tha the trembling of their limbs pro-   ceeded. not entirely :rom the cold. Indeed, more than once they would have gone over the side, upborne by the surface of some in- truding wave, had not theirsgenerous com- rades saved them. With the gratiude com- mon to such lumber, they were-now plotting how they might'rescue themselves, without -a thought for the rest of the crew. Perceiving a small spot dead to leeward, less exposed, apparently, than the other parts of the shore, they at once walked up to their commander, a congenial spirit, and not less frightened than thnmselves,called his attention to the spot and proposed taking to the boat and making an effort to reach it. The pro- ject, to many, would have seemed feasible, and Commodore ----   at once assenting, ordered the boat to be lowered, jumped in himself and was followed by the rest of the gang who had so recently disgraced it, but not another one would join them; and in- deed had they been disposed so to do, the rascals who occupied it, would probably have attempted to prevent it. Both Hardy and Cascel tried to dissuade their comman- - der from the hazardous attempt,representing to him that the heavy cross sea would much endanger their safety, and should they escape that, the entire coast where they were was lined with breakers in which it would be al. f most impossible for the boat to live. But i, argument was of no avail: with an overpow- ering consideration of self, those in the boat sbelieved that the only object which influenced both sailors and officers on board the schoon- er in seeking to induce them to abandon their t project, was to obtain the boat for their own g use--little thinking that had they been so dis- 1. posed they could very easily have effected it. Alas! poor wretches-they soon had cause - to repent their rashness. Having cut them- e selves adrift from the schooner, which shot h from them with the speed of an arrow, they y;were left to their own resources. Getting Is the boat before the wind, and heading directly ts for the shore, they plied their oars with that d desperate energy which their awful situation e, inspired ;-now borne aloft upon the summit ,h of some mountain wave, a mere speck upon ts the wilderness of waters, and again sinking 's into the fearful recesses of the mighty bil- 1- lows, " hid in the bosom of the black abyss." he Again some upheaving wave bears them high Id on its foaming cres, in seeming spor'. o the ed' npt-shell security in which they had so iun- m , advisedly confided, and anon plunging -them n- with lightning speed into the yawning depths n- below.   - th  Still their course is shoreward, Suddenly n- their eager gaze is fixed upon-a high and el, threatenring wave, whose overhanging .crest, at foamless,and smooth, curls in proud disdain rly at the feeble and fruitless efforts of the poor ad wretches to escape. For a moment it seems nd to swell, then with  resistless, headlong in plunge, the mighty mass galls upon them, sir leaving nothing on the surface of the waters eir save here and there a few floatingfragments, an while the doomed crew sink th tnheir wterv ro- Igraves.     Thus miserably perished these heartless vil- lains, bo h principal and accomplice, who had to rudely torn iMaria from her home and the sheltering protection of her mother's arms. When Hardy saw their fate, though he com- nisserated their sufferings, he could not but think that society was benefitted by the death of these desperadoes. But the situation of himself, and those around him, recalled his attention to the schooner, which had now settled decks down to the water, the sea ever and anon making fearful breaches over them hough as yet without any essential injury. They were now in close proximity to the North -Fore-Land that makes out from the  English sides and forms a part of the en- trance to the Straits of Dover. The wind still headed them on shore-the suspense was agonizing, for in a few mnoments the frail bark would either be tossed with resist- less fury amid the craggy rocks, where inevi- table death must be the fate of all on board, or would have doubled the point, and opened a clear sea, where the chances of safety were more cheering. The struggling vessel seemed conscious of the importance of the contest, and most nobly ploughed the angry billows that from time to time knocked her off her course, but which she hurled high aloft as she came up I again covering herself with spray and foam. They are now not more than sixty rods,from  the breakers, and the point they wish to dou-  ble not quite half that distance. Their hopes  revive, but the unstable wind again heads m them-the schooner falls shoreward--another r pull at the lee-tacks and braces, and she r comes again to the wind; the roaring break- a ers are hard aboard them; the tall cliffs are v dotted with men,life-lines in hand, gazing h with painful intensity on the scene and send- I ing up prayers for their safety. Suddenly t those on shore rush to the weather-side of the t  point with their lines coiled up and ready to h throw on the instant, as they see the schoon- f er, baffled by the Vements, heading, directly h for the shore, about a rod inside the point. a One moment more--and the noble craft, by a w sudden and providential change of wind, shoqts by and doubles the point in- safety. h The air is rent with, the cheers of the anxious th spectators, which are heartily answered by tr the deeply-excited seamen. But alas! after ha the first outhreak of joy, the latter are pain- ca fully reminded of their still perilous condi- di tion; for now running before the wind through at the Straits and down the English Channel, m 'the sea is continually boarding them, carry- m ing away bulwarks and stanchions. To add th * to their'horrors, the loose and floating pun- th cheons were fast being stove in the hold-in w which con lition they passed Dover.   ne ma * -- *  'ca, of CHAPTER XIII.        th the The day previous I had been cruising in th the Channel for amusement in my own yacht alr i about Si utv t^is, and laid returned tc sai   vil- ]3over, and was lying a/ anchor just insiae tad the pier, when, being informed of the appear- the ance of the wreck, I immediately gave orders us. to get underweigh, and stood for her. When m- near them, Hardy, who seemed to compre- but hend my wish, hauled his wind, which ena. Lth bled me to run under his lee with less danger, of and, thank God, in a few moments I had is them all on board my own vessel. After 3w some difficulty in beating up, I had the fur- rer ther satisfaction of landing them safe and m, sound at Dover. I conducted Maria to nmy y. father's residence, and insisted on Hardy and he Cassel's accompanying her; the crew, mean- he ' while, being provided 'vith comfottabie luar- n- ters at a good Hotel. Our iamily consisted nd of my father and mother, two kind and affec- se tionate daughters, and myself-their only he son. , My sisters were about Maria's age, t- and, I trust, Madam, you will not deem it i- merely a brother's pride and partiality, when d, I say they were as lovely in mind and person. ed as any of their sex-and, without presuming. e tocompliment, you nusst, I think, acknow. ledge that is saying much in their favor." )f  Elizabeth bowed, while a sweet'.smile st played over her saddened countenance. The n officer continued- it, "Judging that our guests needed both re- p freshment and repose, some light food was I. set before them. After partaking of which. I Maria was resigned to the care of my mother - and sisters, and I conducted Hardy and Cas- s sel to their rooms; assuring them that they would pain me much should they hesitate to r make themselves perfectly at home. Having received an outline from Hardy of the whole -affair, I took post immediately for London, where I arrived' that night. At an early hour next morning, I called at the house of Lady Mary, and learned from the servants that the terrible calamity had almost killed a, their mistress, that the most untiring search had been made, and was still making, by her friends and the police, but with the most dis- heartening results: they as yet not being able to find the least clue to indicate how or where she had gone. 1During this time I was standing in the hall, and, after they had finished, I requested them to bear my compliments to their mis- tress, and say I would, if agreeable to her, be happy to see her, as I had news to communi- cate which might furnish some clue to the discovery of her daughter. A mother's ear, at such a time of intensely painful excite- ment, is ever on the alert. I had delivered my message in a low and subdued voice. for there was in the air and whole appearance of the dwelling, a certain indefinable something which struck the heart with feelings of'sad- ness, and comnanded sympathy for its in- mates. Whether called into action ifn this case by the pale and agitated countenances of the domestics, (for they tenderly loved their young mistress,) the noiseless step or the areeping eye, I know not; but on- entering the hall J felt a weight on my heart which almost prevented the power of speech. I said I spoke in a low tone- but the mention   of her daus hter mu it have fallen on the 01 selsitive ear of the bereaved mother, with th startling distinctness; for with an hysterical soo she almost sprang to my side, and, seiz- jo ing my hand, bent her streaming eyes upon  me, exclaiming- ,i Stranger, in God's name tell me what  tou know of my child! tell me quick, ere d: my poor hea t burst!" Althdugh my profession has frequently p tompelled me to witness scenes of distress nr and suffering, yet the anguish (if this unfor- p tunate mother for a- moment completely over- d came me. As 'soon as I could command myself I led her to a seat, bade her'calni her h excited feelings, and informed her that her h child was safe. She had withdrawn her b hands from mine ard covered her face-her g dishevelled hair, by its glossy blackness,  making her pallid features, when again visi- v b!e, most paillfully conspicuous. Scalding  tears chased each other in -rapid succession f down her cheeks, while her heaving bosom t denoted the tumult within. She sat in silence, save her half-stifled sobs, while I 1 proceeded to relate her daughter's rescue  from the wreck, and assure her of her safety I and health at my father's mansion in Dover.  For a few moments she made no reply; then hastily seizing and wringing my hand, she said- "I cannot, sir, command words to express  the erptions of my heart for the kindness i you have done me and mine-but you have a mother's gratitude, and the prayers of a  grateful heart shall ascend to the throne of God for your happiness." She then declared her intention of imme- diately accompanying me back to Dover, and upon my urging her first to take rest, telling her I would with pleasure await her conve- nience, she replied- "Ah! sir, you little know my feelings if you think I could find rest till I again enfold my beloved daughter in my arms, and I beg therefore you will not object to my im- mediate departure." Perceiving that remonstrance was useless I answered, that, if she was resolved to at- tempt the journey, I would make .arrange- ments for our immediate departure. Informing me that she would 'be ready in an hoir, I took leave, and engaged post- horses. The greater part of the route was passed over in silence, she being too busily occupied with her own thoughts to wish for conversation, and I deeming those thoughts too sacred to venture to disturb them. But as we lessened the distance which separated her from Maria, she became more disposed to converse, asking me many questions con- cerning her daughter's rescue, the cause of ner being torn from her home, how she had borne her sad misfortune, and. if her health had been affected by her exposure to the storm; inanswer to all of which I gave her what little information I possessed, inform- aing her, that, after seeing her daughter safe- ly placed in the hands of my mother and sis- ters I had immediately, and unknown to any 'p.   one but my father, started for London, with the design of taking her to her daughter, fearing she might insist up(n making the journey herself before she had sufficiently re- covered her strength of body or mind; and that I trusted ere we should arrive, Maria would have had the benefit of a night of un- disturbed repose. At length Dover appeared in sight; and I pointed. out to m anxious friend my father's mansion, wher I hoped soon to have the pleasure of pr senting her to her beloved daughter.  \k Immediately u  -  departure, Maria had retired to her chamber, accompanied, at her own request, by my yougest sister-a brght, joyous, yet mild and sympathizing girl ot her own age. In company with the gentle Henrietta, Maria's overburdened heart was soon composed, and in a short time she sank into a quiet and' refreshing slumber, frcm which she did not awake until -some time after the sun had penetrated her apart- ment; when she was completely restored to her wonted health and cheerfulness. On de- scending with my sister to the breakfast room, she found the rest of the family, with Hardy and Cassel, assembled, awaiting her appearance to commence the morning meal; and, in answer to their many kind inquiries, she assured them she' had enjoyed uninter- rupted and refreshing sleep, and felt so fully restored in strength and spirits. that she could no longer consent to trespass on their \ generous hospitality, and should therefore r start for London that very morning. This latter announcement gave her hearers much concern; but my mother replied, with a I smile, that her society was a rich acquisition to their domestic circle, and that they could not on any consideration be induced to part with it, at least, for the present;-besides, f anticipating her natural anxiety to relieve I the fears of her mother, her son George, [ meaning, myself-and here I may as well,"  added he, with a low bow to Elizabeth, "subjoin the remainder of the name, and in- , troduce my humble self to you as Captain - George Fitz-Albert, of 5th r.,;i ment of foot, in - the British East India Company service, had, soon after her arrival at their house, a taken post for London for theiexpress pur- - pose of bringing her mother to Dover, and s that probably in the colrse of the day, she y would again have the pleasure of embracing ,r her parent. Maria's eyes beamed the thank ,s that her joyful and sensitive heart denieL it her the power to utter, and perceiving they d awaited, took in. silence the seat assigned d her. -  The lively rattle of my youngest sister, )f whose eye had never yet been dimmed by d tears of sorrow, except for others woes, ant h over wose spirits the chill blasts of an un- ie feeling 'orld, or the scorchi -g Sirocco of Br bitter disappointment had never swept-in- a- terspersed with the. perhaps more sober but e- yet cheerful remarks of my elder sister Helen, s- whose path in lif, like Henrietta's, had been y I strewn only with lowers-and the 'iveliness     and animation with which the gifted and highly cultivated minds of Lieuts. Hardy and Cassel sustained their part of the con- versation, soon compelled Maria to forget herself, and join with her wonted vivacity in the cheerfil table-talk., In this manner they lingered over their rporning meal; their bright, smiling faces, a true index of their happy hearts. ily father and mother watched the scene with parental pride, and so completely had the engaging manners and frank countenances of their young friends won upon their hearts, that they seemed long to have been members of the same happy family. It was a bright and bewitching morning in June-the gentle, soul-uplifting breeze, Heaven's own pure elixir of health, breathed on all around its buoyant and heart-gladden- ing influence--the birds, those sweetly melo- dious choristers, poured forth their warbling strains and filled the air with joy and mirth -the trees and shrubs, decked in their fresh, rich green foliage, seemed. as 'the gen- tle zephyrs coquetted with their leaves, to bow in willing homage to Him who created them-while the glorious god of day peeped in upon the group thus assembled, and seemed to shine with more intense brightness at wit- nessing a scene of such unclouded happiness on earth, where, alas! the reverse *e but too frequently visible. Ah! methinks I see them now! their countenances radiant with smiles, and their eyes sparkling with the in- nocent gaiety that filled their souls! Oh! who could have looked in upon that happy assembly, anid not dreamed of Heaven-what  mortal, with angered feelings against his brother man, could have witnessed that scene and not felt the demon of reverne quit his I breast! Alas'! that bright circle may never t again surround the social board. One of i their number, continued the officer in a i husky tone, she whose voice fell in rich, and f thrilling tones upon their hearts, now sleeps c in silence on her cold bed, with no shroud t but the waters of the mighty deep; but her f spirit has gone to those bright mansions pre- c pared by Him who loaned the fair .jewel to b earth, that the splendor of its purity might  win our souls, and carry them captive to I Heaven!  But to return.-I know not how long the h joyous group would have continued their u seats at the table, each unwilling to break f the charm  by rising, had not the rattling c wheels of the post-chaise called their atten- h tion to our approach. Never shall I forget d the sparkling of Maria's eye, and the mant- e. ling flush of joy that overspread her counte- st nance, when she recognized and flew to the. st door to receive her mother; nor the wild  scream of delight which escaped the parent's I  heart, when she passionately pressed to her h aching bosom her beloved, restored daughter. : Neither spoke, save in the language of the si yes-but in those glances heart' communed gl with heart,and thought interchanged with w thought, with the rapidity of the lightning'; a; dlash-...ach eager soul drinking in with un- h   id restrained avidity, the fulness of the other ly' But I will not pain you, Madam," said he, I- as he perceived a tear, silently coursing et Elizabeth's cheek, "I will not pain you n with enlarging on their meeting-but will :r continue my narrative, if I have not alieady 1; trespassed too much upon your patience." f  Elizabeth begged him to go on, assuring r him that she was deeply interested in his d story. Fitz-Albert continued- d  "Having' conducted Lady Mary and her s daughter to the parlor, my mother sugge-sted ' to Maria that her parent must be much in y need of refrshment and repose after her 'journey, and desired her to consider herself perfectly at home, and do in all things pre- , cisely as if she were at her own hou t in i London. Upon Maria's promise that she - would doso, my mother and sister left the - room to prepare for a stroll along the cliffs, r and requestilg us gentlemen .to join them. We soon reached the towering cliffs that wall the shores of Dover, and from their tops * enjoyed the wide, extensive view of the chan- nel beneath, dotted here and there with the whited sail of some ocean-tossed barque ploughing her way through the waters, her decks enlivened by the smiling faces and hap- py hearts of officers and crew, as thev gazed once more on their native shores-or of some gallant ship outward-bound, standing down the channel with flowing sheet and proud majestic mien, her crowded decks bearing away to some foreign land hearts tltt sick- ened, as spot by spot of the loved home of their nativity was passed and faded in the distance, perchance never more to gladden them with its sight. Hardv and Cassel were separately, and with great animation, relating to my sisters the particulars of their shipwreck, and point- ing out the course of the vessel, while I was recounting to my parents my humble efforts for their rescue, when a piercing'scream felt on my ears, and, looking around, we found that Henrietta and Cassel had disappeared from the giddy height. Ay sister, with in- cautious step had approached too near thr brink, and slipped over, dragging with her Mr. Cassel, in his fruitless efforts to save her. Rushing to the spot, we saw, with sickening dread, that Cassel, with death-like grasp, had seized a projecting rock with one hand, while with the other he firmly held my half- fainting sister in such a situation that he could neither extricate himself or long retain his hold. But his self-possession did not desert him; fortunately Hardy had discover- ed a rope lying on tne rocks-to make a. strong slip-noose was but the work of an in- stant, and lowering it beneath the feet of Cassel (whose grasp of my sister he assured us would not relax) it was slipped up beneath his arms, and my father and myself assisting Hardy, we had them  in a few I moments be. side us in safety. Turning 'to offer on gratitude to Cassel, he pointed us to Hardy, while Hardy referred us to. ourselves for the assistance we had rendered-but Henrietta having, with restored consciousness, reooar.   ed somewhat of her wonted gaiety, declared that Cassel was her preserver, and Hardy the preserver of both, and with eyes that spoke the gratitude of her heart, she took the arm of the former, 'and. lad the way for home.. 'The gentle Helen had not yet spoken, but she wrung the hands .of Henrietta and her friends, and imprinted a kiss on her sister's cheek as she held her in her embrace; then, with a tear and a smile, she bent her gaze on Hardy and resumed his arm. This incident served but the more firmly to rivet our hearts to the gefltrous Lieuten- ants, to whose presence of mind we were now indebted for the. life of a beloved member of our family. My father having some busi- ness that called his attention before dinner; and my mother wishing to dversee some do- mestic arrangelents, as well as to provide for the comfort of the interesting visitors we had left at home; and I by no means unwil- ling to enjoy a tete-a-tete with Maria, we all agreed that tne snail-like pace of our leaders would not answer for us--and bidding them be home by dinner-hour, and keep themselves from further harm, we left them to stroll at their leisure, and hastened home. We found that Lady Mary and Maria had retired; the former to seek rest and repose, the latter to sit beside her mother and watch her slumbers. I took myself to the deserted drawing-room. Seated in an arm-chair with my gaze on vacancy, my thoughts dwelt in exstacy upon that happiness which I had been, in some degree, instrumental in pro- ducing. But the recollection that my fur- lough was about expiring, and that in a few -tays I should probably receive orders to em- bark for Iidia, cast a shade over my spirits, and rudely demolished those airy castles of pleasing rambles and delightful tete-a-tetes, so delightfully reared-fo' I had surrendered my heart at first-sight to Mauria. In the tnidst of these reflections, a servant entered and handed me a package to my address. From the superscription of the envelope, there was no mistaking the tenor of its contents, and to my grief I read- "The company's ship Fire-Fly will sail from London in six wees,; and will put into Dover foi yourself and others, required to join her at that port." With my head resting on one hand, and the open papers in the other, I abstractedly murmured, "and must I leave in six short weeks all that vWhich makes life so dear to me now? Alas I I had fondly hoped"- "Six short weeks, said you, Mr. Fitz- Albert; you cannot think of leaving your parents, your sisters, and---and-your friends, so soon," said Maria, who had entered the room unperceived, while I was lamenting my hard fate. "Six weeks! indeed, Mr. Fitz- Albert, how can I in so short a time stffi- ciently express to you the gratitude with which my heart is filled for your kindness to my mother and myself." 4 "Maria," said I,-" for indeed you must permit me thus to'address you-the little   service which it has oeen ny good fortune to render you, be assured, needs no reward but your friendship; that will be a .ource of in- finite comfort to me in a foreign land, from which I may be destined never to return. I need it. I feel that life would be a dreary thing without it-you will not refuse me, Maria?" said I, my heart filled with sadness, while I clasped her hand. ';Mr. Fitz-Albert," returned the generout girl, "be assured you shall have the warm- est friendship of my heart as long as that heart continues to beat." I imprinted on her hand an impassioned kiss, and was about replying, when she gently withdrew it, and' said she dared not longer leave 'her mother. "Stay, Maria, stay one moment, I entreat you. " "Indeed I cannot, Fitz-Albert, another time I will see you-but my mother ia moving, and surely you would not wish to detain me from her side," she added, casting on me a look full of kindness, blended with gentle entreaty. I suffered her to depart, notwithstanding my heart would have unfolded volumes to her. The kind manner with which she had received the expression of my feelings-the saddened tones of her sweet voice when ex- pressing her regret at my speedy departure, 'filled my soul with emotions so new and strange to me. Her unrestrained and cor- dial responses seemed not the dull, unmean- ing words that fall in cold accents on the ear from the lips of 'an indifferent acquain- tance, but in tones that come from a conge- nial heart. Indeed, she spoke more in the winning strains of an affectionate sister than the chilling formality of an acquaintance of bdt yesterday. It is true we had then me ' for the first time; but what were the circum- stances of that meeting? Not a formal in- troduction in the crowded ball-room; nor the chilling etiquette of the more stately draw- ing room; but amid the battling elements, on the deck of a fast-sinking barque, in which vessel she had experienced great misery, and from which she had entertained little hopes of escape. It was a meeting of this kind which brought our hearts together with the reciprocal feelings of old acquaintance, and it was foreign to the nature of both to suffer the ceremonies of society to crush or sunder those ties which from the first hour we felt had bound us together. When Maria left me I resumed the seat vacated at her ap- rroach, and was, again wrapped in the busy emotions of joy and grief that filled my soul-joy, that in her I had a sincere and ardent friend-and grief, that in so short a time I should be separated from her, perhaps forever. The thought was insupportable. and I mentally resolved-but I will nct anti. cipate.'     CHAPTER XIV. I' was near our usual dinner-hour, and the loitering pedestrians, whom we had left to pursue their homeward way with that srail-likl pace so common to friendly and communing spirits, soon made their appear- ance, their cheeks glowing with health and their eyes sparkling with pleasure. After ieparating to dress for dinner, we again as- sembled below, where we found my parents, with Lady Mary and her daughter. A slight tinge suffused the cheeks of the latter as I seated myself beside her and her parent- who was renewing the expression of her gratitude to me, when I interrupted her by the assurance that her daughter had said all and more than .I deserved, for the slight service, and then turned the conversation upon general subjects. Time flew swiftly on, each departing day painfully reminding me of the few that in- tervened ere I should be compelled to leave the enchanting society of such valued friends. We often indulged in extensive rambles, my companion being always my adored Maria. it was during one of these excursions that I made her fully acquainted with the state of my heart, and the unutter- able grief that would fill my soul should I be compelled to leave my country without her; and concluded by urging her immedi- ately to become my bride, and accompany me with her mother. The dear girl declared it useless for' her to attempt to disguise her feelings-that from the first hour of our meeting, she knew not why, she had felt a strong interest for me, which had subsequent- ly ripened into esteem, and finally acknow- edged that the thought of separation was equally painful to her as myself; and that if her mother did not object, she blushingly replied that she would accede to my request. With tumultuous joy I pressed her to my heart, while I thanked her from my soul for the sacrifice she was willing to make-and as we turned homeward, I seemed to be in a delirium of cxstacy-in fact, in a new world. Nature had assumed a dress of brighter, deeper hue, the air was more balmy, fragrant and buoyant, and the birds seemed to have learned a new song whose notes thrillingly v'trated on my soul. Maria left me in the parlor, while she sought her mother for the, purpose of making the announcement,  Seated at the open window, and surrender- ing myself to the pleasant anticipations which my brightening prospects seemed to warrant, my meditations were suddenly put to ffght by the entrance of Hardy, who said he was glad to find me alone, that he had that morning made proposals to my sister Helen, which had teer. favorably received. "My fine fellow," said I, wringing his hand, "I give you joy. I had rather give my Helen to you than to the proudest noble in the land."             ] t Nay, not so fast, my kind friend," he re- i   turned, "she has promised to abide the de, cision of her parents." "I will see to that, Hardy,"-and while we were still talking of the matter, Casse' [ looked in and would have retired, but I called him back, telling him I wished to consult with him on important business. Yes, sir," 'I continued with mQCk solemnity, 'on busi- - ness of the utmost importance. Here's yomr friend, Mr. Hardy, not satisfied with winning ' all our hearts, but has had the audacity to ask the hand of my sister Helen. What say you? Shall we run him up to the fore- yard-arm, or splice them and let them sai' in company." "Indeed, I can hardly say, replied Cassel, "fr I plead guilty to the like charge con- cerning the other fair sister, having also made like proposals to her, and it was to in- form you of the fact that I was seeking you." "And she, too, the lovely, laughing jade, told yon she would consult her parents, eh? Well, well, make yourselves easy, gentle- men; we are all on the same tack,-I too have made proposals this morning to the lovely Maria. In three weeks I set sail for India, and should our fair charmers not object, we will on the same day make ourselves members of one family. That the proposals of the gen- ' tlemen would be accepted by my parents, I made no doubt, for my father was well ac- quainted'with their families (which were highly respectable) as well as with their own characters. After mutual congratulations, we separated. My parents gave the propos- als that mature deliberation which the wel- fare of their daughters 'demanded, and my father told Hardy and Cassel that they could not consent to part with them unless the gentlemen would resign their commissions and accept an interest in his business. In that case, he would cheerfully give his con- sent. Cassel and Hardy seized his. hands, and, with the sailor's warmth of feeling, thanked him for his generous offers,' and as- sured him that next day's post should convey their resignations to Head Quarters. I had the satisfaction of hearing from Maria's own lips that her mother had consented to our union, and agreed to accompany us in our voyage. All was now confusion and hubbub in the heretofore quiet, orderly house. My father declared the whole establishment was turned into a mantaumaker's shop-silks and satins, pins and needles, threads and shreds, every- where obstructing his passage-and that he was almost disposed to annul the contract, for so 'busy were all hands that he could hardly find ay one who had i moment to spare for conversation. On the morning of the third of July, five years since, the Fire-Fly arrived in Dover port, from which her commander informed me she would sail on the 5th inst. Having completed all our arrangements, on the eve- ning of the 4th, Maria, Helen and Henrietta, with Hardy, Cassel and myself, were united   Ia the holy bands of wedlock--nd in due the Wason the London papers announced the li f anet to their readers.         W After a prosperous voyage we arrived at pi lr destined port. I will not detain you wi with a detail of the many happy hours w de passed together. .Sffice it to say, that during wi the period of more than three years residence he I' in India our happiness was not marred by an l unkind word or thought; we were, if possi- gl ble, mor devotedly attached to each other co by being lessed with this fine boy and sweet it image of his mother. I had been' so fortu- a uate as to signalize myself in several severe fr  nlggements, from which, as you perceive, tr I did not escape without receiving some at marks of the enemy's regard for me, and my health having become somewhat impaired w by frequent exposure, I obtained leave of ab- pi sance for one year, and with my wife and ta child, resolved to visit England, and for that a purpose embarked in the Company's ship te  Archimedes for London. We had also as b passengers a number of invalids, whose con- I stitutions were worn down by a long resi- ti lence in India, and who were seeking restor- a ation in the more congenial climate of their ti native isle. Our voyage was rapid, and with- c out accident, till we encountered the terrible t tempest which left our gallant ship the mis- a erable wreck you saw her, and sent to their e long homes so many valued friends:"  Here, for a moment, the recollection of the ( scene, and his own dreadful bereavement, 1 overpowered him-but, soon recovering him- self, he continued- "The fearful and ominous stillness of the j elements, the sultry and breathless air, the  brassy hue of the hazy sky, the dull, heavy aspect of the, sea, the lazy roll of the ship,  and the creaking of her booms, all fell on the heart with an oppiessive weight, and: foretold to the experienced mariner the ap- proach of danger. Our commander had re- duced the sails of him ship to her three top-  sails-but the first Lieutenant had stationed men at the top-sail-halyards and sheets, with orders to see that they were free, and to let fly at thword. At length the hazy, smoky curtain that overspread the sky far down in the distant horizon, began'to curl and sepa- rate in ragged, distorted particles, rolling and coiling in wild, tumultuous disorder- while the space it left was supplied by the foamy crested wave. The hot, suffocatingg air now rushed in board with scorching heat. Let go all!" cried the first Lieutenant, with startling energy, while he ordered the ship to be placed before the coming tempest; "clew up with a will, my men," continued he, as the top-sail-yard settled down and the clews of the sails, in obedience to sturdy hands, flew home. But now the air was rent with the shrieks and screams of the fu- rious tempest, and filled with the spray and foam of the madly lashed waves.  The storm struck us on the quarter, and as the noble ship bent before tne 'blast, the main and mizzen-top-sails flew from the yards in en thousand shreds, and the next moment   the three masts went crashing over the s de lightened of her spars, the ship heavily and with difficulty rose to an even keel, her prow pointed with the wind. Onward she flew with frightful speed, as if stung with mad- dening fury, dashing high the foaming waves that beset her path, and threatened her' with instant destruction. The wreck had been cleared of the entan- gled spars as speedily as possible, and we continued to scud before the tempest until its fury had subsided; ere, that, however, a driving and terrific sea tore our rudder from the stern, and as the ship sunk into the trough of the sea1 a second wave struck her abeam and capsized her. All hands, except myself, who 'had just descended into the hold, were on deck, and many of them must have perished on the instant-how the others re- tained their hold on the bottom of the vessel, amid such a scene, for a moment, is a mys- tery to me; certainly they could not have been in that situation longere your approach. My feelings at being thus pent up without the possibility of aiding my beloved wife  and child, or even the melancholy satisfac- ' tion of dying with them, you can easily I conceive--in vain did I make repeated at- tempts to dive out of the hold-flung back and bruised at every effort, I almost abandon- ed myself to despair; at length, gathering strength and drawing in my breath to the e utmost of my power, I resolved to make one , desperate efibrt, and free myself, orP perish in - the attempt. After I had attained, as nearly as I could e judge, a sufficient depth, I struck off horizon- e tally for some time, and then rising to the y surface, had the satisfaction of finding my- , self outside the ship, and close to her keel. n This I succeeded in reaching, and with some d difficulty crawled up out of the water-but r- alas! what was my grief at not finding a soul - who could speak to me of my poor wife and p- child. d  I had been in this situation but a few mo- h ments, faint, and almost exhausted with the et .sufferings of mind and body, when I observed :y your vessel standing for the wreck. With in the feelings common to humanity, I still a- clung to life; and, with just strength .enough ig for the purpose, waved my hat, and then - sunk back exhausted, and should have been he washed into the sea had not the boat reached ig' me as it did. Since that hour, till coming Lt. on deck this morning, I have been insensibl th to everything around me. I looked at ob- ip jects, but saw them not; I spoke and acted ;t; as an automaton, for my thoughts were bu- ed ried in the deep; and when I first obtained he a glimpse of the child seated on your lap, dy I could hardly'believe my senses that what 'as I saw before me was a reality or any other fu- than the creation of miy own disordered nd imagination; but when the blessed boy re- 'he cognized me himself, and cried "papa,' I the could no longer doubt, and, snatching him to gin my heart, feared that while I gazed he would in again banish from my sight. ent, Thus, Madam, have I endeavored to giv     you an outline, inougn at best imperfect, of the history of. my poor wife. I should have mentioloned, that soon after our arrival out, her mother, whose constitution had become terribly shattered' by her manry and severe trials, gradually sunk, and was found one morning dlead in her bed; a sweetly placit smile resting on her countenance, indicating that she dlied without pain. Although her loss was sad to us, still the peaceful manner with which she took her. departure, allayed the pang of separation, and made us more calmly resign our own will to the will of Providence. And when the past life of a de- parted friendl recalls to the mind of the sur- vivors naught but what is ullntarnished and bright, this of itself insensibly supplies the balmn which heals the wxounded heart; and Maria, cheered by the reflection that during the whole tine in which she had dwelt be- neath the maternial roof, she had omitted nothing in her power to render her mother happy, was soon enabled to resume her du- ties with a resigned and even cheerful heart. CHAPTER XV. . I'he party were now joined by Capt. I Thompson and Count Miontmorencv who hadl just ascended the deck.  Eiizabeth rose  from her seat on the appearance of her fa- l ther, and after receiving from him a parental  kiss and his, together with Capt, T's, con a gratulations on her good looks, turned and h introduced each of them to Capi. Fitz-Al4bert and not a little astonished them by the infr- h mation which she gave of his relationship to si the child. Both gentlemen seized a hand of b Fitz-Alboelrt, and in the walrmeslt manner con- d; gratulated him on the recovery of his childi ir while they feelingly and delicately expressed th their sympathy for the loss of the mother. de "But come, madam," said Capt. T., "I fear. my larder will hardly hold out ifyouac- uI custom yourself to these early and protractedi be visits to the deck. A half hour spent in in- ou haling this bracing morning air, produces lot an appetite of which landsmen know noth- ou ing. Why, even in the close, confined cabin Ca where I've been sitting with your father, the much interested in his recital of the events sh of your shipwreclk, the influence of this norn- fre ing breeze has keenly affectedl my appetite- en. and I doubt not if my steward should serve th( IIs with a dish of stewed spikes wie should aft devour them with avidity. But come, ma- d^ daim," repeated Capt. Thompson, giving his str arm to Elizabeth, " and, gentlemen, let's de- I fav 'scend and see what wRe have for breakfast."  "i say, Tom," said one of the men for- in ward, to his comrade, who was with him  str; eaning over the bows of the ship and gazing clo on the sparkling waters, while each had B i toi some time studiouoly avoided the gaze of pac his messmate, '"I say, Tom, who's that unc ehore-going officer that took on so when he und Faw that child I 'm blest ifl didn't think seel he was going to throw him into the sea! and ger]   of did you see too, how his scuppers were X an. ive ning?  And then, Tom, that neat ringer 'ut, craft alongside on him, how she sets het me own eye-pulnps going, all for pure sympathy, ere God bless her sweet little timbers! I'm blow- ne ed if I could help keeping her company.': id  "I know it, Ned, and 'taint no more use ng trying to keep down natur; I can no mure er keep my eye-pumps dry when I see one of ier them ere shore-going, swreet little craft with ed their eye scuppers a running, than a porpoise ire could reef a topsail. I suppose that child of belonged to the oincer and he had sorehow e- lost him and just discovered him ." r-' "How can that be, Tom? didn't you see 'd them all come aboard with the child in the ie same boat, from that ere Lord Peter-what- id you-call-em's yacht?"  "A  "Yes, but didn't you see Ntc-' , that the - officer had a flag of distress set? and low ed down in the mouth he looked, and when he er stepped on deck and tripped against some ot - the gun-tackle, didn't yoli hear him say as "he touched his hat,' I ax your pardon, siP -thinking he'dl got foul of some of the offi- cers? Well then, Ned, I'm thinking they must somehow have pickedl both on 'em up at sea, and the officer thinking the child was drowned, kinder lost his reclkoniillng for a  piece and got bewildered-he, till he hove in l sight of the laldy sitting on the quarter-deck with the child in her lap, and both on 'emn looking so angelic-like; and then the little feller singing out 'papa!' too, why 'that alone, Ned, was enough to bring him back to I his right course."  Here the boatswain's whistle, piping all hands to breakfast, put a stop to the conver- I sation. In the course of the morning a fair breeze freshenedl and continued for several days to hlow moderately. While under -its influences, the gallant ship sped hel way through the waters, rapidly approaching her destined port, till one day at noon the cry ce "Sail ho!" resounded from the fore-top, and upoIn the officer of the deck inquiring her bearings and what he made of her, the look- - out replied, "She seems to be, sir, a rakish looking schooner, and is standing athwart our bows, ahout two' points to windtiward."  Capt. Thompson having been imlformed of the appearance of the stranger, ordered the ship to be kept away two points, and the wind freshening, they soon approached neat enough to see her hull from the deck througn the glass. Capt. Thompson was convinced, after a moment's scrutiny, that she was in- deed a suspicious looking craft-while the [ strander seemed to have formed the same iln- 7favoichle opinions of the 'Britantiia. for as "-p"t. Thompson was on the point of remov-I ing the glass from hi eyes, he observed the stra nger in stays, and the next moment clroding all sail on a different course. The Britannia hauled her wind somewhat and  packed on all the canvas she could stagger under, and while the ship majestically aowed under the weight of the breeze, seemed to  scent the neighborhood of- an enemy, so ea- gerly did she rush forward and impatiently g Ig   ^lh asuind er t he ie ina w a ves. As they Saeared the schooner, Elizabeth, who, from \ n; Savi spent so mucsh time at sea, had be- i ome     sosmeowhat conver an w th the ue of 8ihe   e spY-glass, took up the instrument and F anxiously scrutinized1 the vessel. Although.1 she was under the impression that Roderigo pro was afar off in a different direction; still shepo thought  within herself, "he may have alter- a ed his course and passed us unperceiv ed, and  now perhaps shows himself at what he thinks r a safe distance, tand t G od grant it may prove l So in order to induce his enemy to approach au his porst by some other path than that he h would be most likely to take."  * * alo i  Pedro,"d said the Commander of the olu! i chase to his frst officer, "Well, Pedro, what do you think 'now? Are you not yet satis-th n d tnat te craft yonder, who ses su anox- h ious to make ourti acquaintance, is one of John th Bull's thunderers?"            ad -' TherO e seems no doubt of that, Captain o Henandez; but I don't see the wuse of letting ! the lubber drive us down here so far from our  course." '              - ,c 'No  ! I suppose you would have him  n; alongside, and instead of letting him run m down here, where, as soon as it becomes dark, a we can easily dode him, you would let him te run you up to the yard-arnl! for deped upon f it, Pedro, these d -d 'sea lawyers are not sa prowling round herb e for nothing. I shou not be surprised if those cursed scoundrels o hose lives we spar, d from the Robert, not- g withstanding we had the generosity to plt b them in a' boat with the wide sea around a t hem, had the ingratitude to reach some port i id inform against us; because1 forsooth, I was fool enough to mind the otd prating a priest's threats, and not sendt them where we r have many times sent their betters-to ol! *Father Jones'. Aye! aye! spare your pou- t den, my old boyl continted He rnandez, as a reath of smoke curled labout the bows of  the Britannia, and a shot came rockettinl yover the water about half way to them, let's have the glass, Pedro--let's see what I old gouty wants. Aye! there goes his hunt- ing! Come, Pedro, let's show the old beep eater that we can be mannerly. Run up the' ebony, and'let long Tom take our compli- ments to hi's Majesty's red apron." In obedience to these orders, the flagg soon flew to the peak of the mainsail, while the. schooner, luflitig so as to present her botad- -side to the Britannia, fired her long Tonm and then fell off before the wind again. After watching the ship for a few moments; Her- nandez continued- "Aye, you may as well muzzle  your bull dogs for the present-their barking, you see, only pro okes others to do the like; and as for their bite, I'm not in a mood now to see their teeth, and therefore I'll not trouble you to show me a specimen. Blow, my good breez- es, blow!" he exclaimed, as the freshenino wind distended the sails almost to bursting, and the rakish c:aft shot through the waters with the speed of a dolphin, " that's yOU' SOu't vou old iade-use your heels this fashion   for a short time, and yon old boy will 6nd i tough work to keep in sight of your Lady- ship. I say, Pedro," as they were fast sink- ing the Britannia, "give them a parting gun from the stern by way of anchovy for eupper. The gun was fired, but Whatever elffect it produced in the breasts of their enemies, it produced no other indication of feeling than a display of more canvas on the already al- most o  rerburtheneld spars.  I I say, Jack," said a savage, cut-throat looking' rascal, keeled upon the fore-top-gal- lant dleek to a no less interesting shipmate, who was brandlishing his blood-stained cut- 'ass at the enemy, "I say, Jack, how cruel old Uncle John is to take so many nice little fellers firom their mamas and send them in that ere ship out on this big pond! iMy eyes, how the littie chaps would take on and wish themselves safely moored to their mammy's apron-strings, if we should just drop aboard on 'em."  "Ayer you may well say that, Bill," said - his messmnate, seating himself alongside,l his companion; " but. Bill, what in the devil's name does our captain dodge about here so Imuch for? Except that affair of the Robert  and that old Dutch tub, we have had nothing to do, but dodtging in and about Jamakly this n foul months-it's too bail, and blow me if I t stand it."' 1  "So I say, Jack; if the captain's a mind s to be cutting his shines ashore, as sonme - great titled thingumbob, I say let him do it, t but IP'm l--d if I'm going to expose myself d any longer to them ere cruisers by hang- rt ing-" I  "Avast, Bill! don't use that word-any g other but that, for the very sound of it gives. -e me the sore-throat." d  Here the two worthies were interrupted by v- the order to take in studding sails. Both a vessels had been running for some time a ,f south-west course, but it being now quite gr dark, Hernandez changed to a more south- n, erly direction, believing that he was sufli at ciently distant from his pursuer to cross his it- thwart without danger of discovery, In ff- this opinion he was correct, for the schooner he was a swift sailer, and, moreover, was not li- long out of- port, where she had been hove out and newly coppered, and when the breeze on freshened she had moved before it (the water he. offering but slight resistance to her sharp, id- clear hull,) as though she had been a part of nd-,the breeze itself. At five o'clock the next ter morning they were up with Rumkey, and er- running the schooner close in, Heraandea anchored between the two white cliffs on the ,ull south-eastern part of this island. Here see, having snugly furled his sails, his small as tapering spars presenting but a faint line, see wrhich could not be discerned at even a very you little rlistance, and letting fall over the mon- s ez- key rail fore and aft, and also over the stern, ing a white painted canvass covering,which de- ig, scended on all sides to the water, and was ters securced on board to the rail by small hoops ort, for that purpose, he felt fully convinced that lion,  he could hardly fail of avoiding discoveryv     unless by some vessel passing very near. To prevent being taken by surprise, and also to enable him to obtain a view of his pursuer and watch her movements, (should she ap- proach in the vicinity of his hiding-place,) as well as to ascertain, if possible; who she was and what was her object, he with two of his sharpest look-outs, with their glasses, scrambled to the top of the clifs; here, re- clining at full length, they carefully swept the eastern horizon, not a speck within the compass of their vision escaping their no- tice. They had been thus engaged but a short time before Hernandez's sharp eye dis- covered a sail in the direction of about two points south of east. He soon perceived she was standing to the north-west: continuing on this course for some time, she suddenly bore about north-east, when he observed her fill away before the wind, and stand directly for them. He was soon satisfied that it was the same vessel that had given them chase the day previo-xs, but he felt so confident in his present security, that he continued to keep his position, and watch his enemy, while he ordered his two companions to lie close. The ship was now nearly up with Watlings Island--a short distance in a north-easterly direction from where. the schooner was lying; when she again chang- ed her course and stood to the south-east. * * * "Well, sir, what do you think became of that precious rascal last night?" said Commodore Thompson of the Britannia to the Captain of the Canso; " what a clean pair of heels the scoundrel showed us! "He did indeed," replied Capt. Scott, "'and I should not be surprised, sir, if he were now dodging about, down among some of the leeward islands." "Very like-well, let the poor devil enjoy the open air while he may; I trust we shall boon have him dancine in it, though at an elevation more agreeable to witness than ex- perience." The Britannia had' now opened Rum Key,. (Atwood's Key bearing about S. West from them) when Lieut. St. Albans, touching his cap, approached his commander, handed him the glass, and called his attention to the sin- gular and unusual appearance of the base of the Cliffs. "Well, Mr. St. Albans," said the command- er to his first officer., "I see nothing there but a large rock lying between the two cliffs." "irue, sir; but did you ever observe that rock before?" "Never, sir-but what then? it is evident- ly a rock that has separated from one of its neighbors and come to an anchor at their o feet' We will take 4 look at it on our next cruise, Mr. St. Albans," and handing the glass to the lieutenant, he continued his promenade of the quarter-deck. The lieutenant, who was a warm admirer of Geology, felt a strong interest in the stran- Fer rock, and taking another survey of it through the glass, perceived a slight tremu- sous motion of its sides, for which, at first, he I was puzzled to account. but which he finally   attributed to tl e vapors of the oce4 , engen- dered by the s arching rays of the cloudles sun. Contenting himself, as well as he could, with the promise of his commander, to visit the spot at their next cruise, he was in the act of lowering the glass from his eyes, when the ship having opened the two cliff', the masts of the schooner were fully exposed - but, as he had removed the instrunrent for a momen:, he had such an imperfect view that although his impression was that they were spars, still he thought he might be deceived, and ere he could raise the glass again, the ship had shut the schooner in. Believing himself mistaken, inasmuch as they could not have, opened a view of the spars without seeing the hull of the vessel, he gave no fur- ther thought to the matter. The ship hay- ling broad opened Mayaguana Passage, filled away again, giving a wide berth to the dan- gerous reef that makes off to the south-east from Rum Key, stood to the south-west, pass- ing about midway between  Mayaguana -Island and the French Keys; hauling a lit- tle more to the south and shaving the Hog- sties on her starboard, and Hereage Island on her larboard, she bore up for Cape St. Nicholas, when again filling away, she stood for Jamaica, and in due course of time let go her anchor in safety in the harbor of Port Royal, where they found the frigates Fredo- nia and Isabella, and also a packet for Lon. don about getting underweigh, on board which Capt. Fitz-Albert immediately resol- ved to take passage with his child. Count Montmorency, however, upon being informed that another vessel would sail for England shortly, deemed it prudent that his daughter should have some repose on shore, ere she should again be exposed to the danger of the seas. Having become strongly attached to I the child, Elizabeth found it more painful to part with it than she had anticipated; the child too, when made acquainted with the sad intelligence that he was now to be sepa- rated from his new mamma, encircled her neck with his little chubby arms and cried as though his heart would break. Although Elizabeth's fond and deeply sympathetic heart felt strongly inclined to indulge in the like marks of sorrow at parting, she yet con- trolled her feelings and with a smiling though moistened eye, strove to reconcile the boy to their present separation, bidding him as he loved her, dry his eyes and kiss her; and telling him also that she was soon to follows and that he must make haste with his papa and get home before her. sr as to hare all his pretty things to show her when she ar rived. Reader! 'didst ever witness a gentle show er, with the rays of a bright, unclouded sum meres sun falling upon its crystal drops--o roam the summer fields at early morn, the dew still reposing on some fair and blooming flower, catching and reflecting with spark ling brightness the rays of that luminary? If so, thou canst perhaps form some idea of the imelting richness of those-eyes that wer:   muned by Elizabeth o. t te beautiful and ex-  pressive face of the child.      of To Fitz-Albert's earnest entreaties that on it Iteir return to England they would, if possi- ble land at Dover and pay him a visit, u Co tat Montmorency replied that should it w be in their power, they would be most happy, ri to avail themselves of his politeness: at any s r te, were it not convenient to land at Dover' o they would improve the first opportunity af- . ter their arrival in England, to see him. t Once more taking and receiving a parting t kiss from the boy, and wishing his father all a those blessings which the good always de- light to see bestowed upon the deserving, s they warmly grasped Fitz-Albert's extended t hands and bade him farewell. After wait- q ing to see him with his child put on board n the packet, which was already underweigh, 1 and returning their thanks to Capt. Thomp- p son, for his kindness to them, and begging  him that while they remained on the Island, to favor them with his company as often as agreeable or convenient to him, they disem-  barked and proceeded to their late residence at Kingston, in company with Capt. Scott of the Canso-who was the bearer of the un-  welcome intelligence to sundry individuals  of Kingston of the loss of their property, by the wreck of his vessel. ",   CHAPTER XVI. On the morning after the cruiser had pass- ed his rendezvous, Hernandez gave orders to get the schooner under weigh. While the necessary preparations were making for this purpose, one of the two seamen (whose dis- satisfaction we have previously mentioned,) boldly walked up ,o his commander, and  asked if he was bound for Jamaky?" cause . you see if you are, I'm d--d if Bill Oak- um--" "What's that you say, you d---d muti- nous dog?" exclaimed Hernandez, his eyes flashing fire, while at the same moment the blade of his cutlass laid open the left cheek of the daring sailor, "take that, you infernal scoundrel, and go forward to your duty; and let, me hear no more complaints, or by'the gods you shall swing from yonder yard-arm!" The sailor, with a scowl of deep defiance, muttering that he should live to repent that blow, turned on his heel and went forward to his work. Hernandez, who saw and felt the look, while the threat did not escape him, was on the point of ordering the man to be seiz- ed, when his quick eye caught the fierce and lowering looks of the crews as they saw the blood gushing from the ghastly wound in the cheek of their comrade. Pretending neither to have heard the threat, nornto have per- ceived the revengeful glance of the seaman, Hernandez, in a careless, unconcerned tone, gave in rapid succession the necessary or- lers fdoronce more getting the schooner out to sea. Bting now fairly under weigh, with all sail set, soree few of his messmates went r    below and grouped around Oakum, whlts one of them, who officiated as surgeon, was dress- ing his wound. Avast, Jack-heave to a bit," said Oak- um, as he laid a firm grip on the arm of one who, with unsheathed cutlass, was about rushing to the deck followed by some dozen shipmates with like hostile intentions, "Hold on, I say, and let go your anchors alongside, while I give you a bit of a yarn consarning the d,---d old hell cat, and then make mut- ton-head broth of me if my plan for revenge ain't the sweetest for all on us." As soon as his comrades had seated them- selve s around him, he requested the doctor to brin., old Never-flinch's hand. This sobri- quet was applied to one of their former mess- mates who had been recognized when ashore, taken, tried, condemned, and executed as a pirate; but who unflinchingly refused to be. tray his comrades, notwithstanding a flee pardon had been offered him, backed by a suf- ficient sum to enable him to spend the re- mainder of his life in ease and idleness on shore; and who died a proud martyr to that honor which'would have graced the noblest character. After his execution, Oakum had through the agency of an old woman, ob- tained his right hand, and an oath over it was considered by these desperadoes as bind- ing as the seal'of death. "Now, comrades," said Oakum, taking the hand, "I want you to swear by this flipper that, you'll never 'peach what I'm goin' to tell you; and arter I've unravelled the yarn you'll be governed by me in your revenge." Each in succession tin, taking the dried and shrivelled hand, preed it to his lips and said, "I swear by mis right hand of old Never-flinch not to 'peach, but to do as I am "bid by Bill Oakum, as I hope to escape the f hempen cravat." "Sail ho!" resounded throughout the schooner, and at the same instant all hands sprung foi the deck, not even excepting Oak- ' um, who, in the excitement of the moment, ; forgot his wound, and, with his messmates, had the impressson that the cruiser was close upon them, so sudden and startling was the' announcement. On reaching the deck they' Ifound their vessel was standing close hauled to the wind in a southerly direction; the north-east point of Wattings Island bearing , about north, while a little to the eastward of t this, far down in the horizon, could just be discerned a large square-rigged vessel, appa- rently standing to the westward. Tacking s ship, the schooner soon shot by the s' t h- - western point of Wattings, and giv ng the I seven miles reef, which stretches off in a no!- therly direction from Conception Island, a e wide berth, and having ordered the helms- r man to keep her about west by north, Her- - nandez took another glance at the stranger k, through his glass, and sent the steward below i, for his belt containing boarding pistols, which - he adjusted to his person. The crew being t aware that he never did this unless he was h sure he should have occasion for them, were t busily engaged in putting their knives, cut ,*  ,.          .      lasses, and pistols itl readiness for iamedi- ate u:se. Hernandez beheld their activity and zeal with a grim smile of satisfaction, for he well knew what a lawless band they were, and his conscience told him how far e had contributed to make them so-how he had tyranized over them, and how much cause he had to dread their vengeance, and hopl that in gratifying them with an oppor- tunity to shed others' blood, they would for- get tO wreak their-vengeance on him, which for a long time he had been fearful, sooner or later, they would attempt. Hernandez was neither a brave man, nor yet a coward; but a consummate villain He would fight when convinced he had every advantage over his enemy, or when from absolute compulsion, with the most savage ferocity. His temper was wild and ungov- ernable, often bringing him into difficulty with his crew, from which it required his utmost address to escape without provoking  an open and general mutiny. He was selfish  in the extreme, and often, in sharing the money which they had obtained from ves-  sels plundered and burnt, he was detected in  a fraudulent division of the spoils, which the crew invariably passed over in silence but recorded in their memories for an after d settlement. Not one spark of honor illu- a mined his breast--he possessed not even that s which is said to find a habitation in the p breasts of thieves and robbers, for he hd a already laid his plans (after he had accom- 1 plished a certain object, with which the i reader will ere long be made acquainted,) to ti surrender his whole crew on condition of a i full pardon for himself. With this scheme I in view, he had always conveyed his own tc share of plunder ashore, and privately buried d it in the earth. Possessing, in a great de- w gree, the coml'ned qualities of the serpent N and the fox, he had been enabled thus far to sc preserve the command over the lawless ruf- sa fians around hin ; and was, lie flattered him- fr self, fast gaining their confdence when the is unlucky affair occurred between himself go andt Oakum, which he saw at once had re- A vived all their former ill feelings. To en- deavor once more to reinstate himself in by their favor, he ordered all hands to be passed foa aft, and thus addressed them:      d " My lads, I had intended before this to re have given you. the reasons why I have kept you so long idle, and why I have spent so ha much time on shore atl Kingston; but va- we rious cirpumstances occurred which ore- les vented me from doing so. In the first place, gr then, I was inthrmed that the rich old plan- d ter, De Castro, intended embarking for Eng- ear land -with his immense wealth, and, not cri wishing that such a fine bird should escape ear us, I found it necessary to proceed with the wil utmost caution in making my inquiries re to  lative. to ihe time and mode of his departure. sue In order to do this without exciting suspi- rea cion, I was obliged to work myself gradually pid and with aoparent sincerity into his confi- eve ilence-and it was not until the day before ing vs sai ed from Port Royal that he informed I   di- me he had jus heard from England tha ity three frigates were to be despatched for this on, quarter to cruise for the no!evious Meteor- iey how oar craft got that name I know not he -(for he had not heard of the existence of he Roderigo's, and was well satisfied, that it was ch their own bloody deeds which had called out nd the cruisers,) and that he had made up his )r- riini to postpone his visit to England till ir- after their arrival, not doubting but their sh prest :ce would free these' waters from the or scourge which now infested them. Of course I applauded his decision; and now let me or ask you. my lads, if he could have adopted a n. better course than this, for us-for you see y at once how easily he must fall into our m hands  While the cruisers are scouring the e seas about the Leeward Islands, (where I'm v- told they think we rendezvous,) or are sweep ty inl the Spanish Main, they leave the game is to fall into our nets without danger of moles g tationl---or we will dodge about his wake h till he is clear of the land, then pounce upon e him, seize his treasures, and, for fear of his - fretting himself to death, give him and his n companions a card of admission to Davy hJones-'s dominions. e,  "As soon as De Castro had given me tho r desired information, I resolved, in .order to - avoid suspicion at my long stay, and at the same time to be out of' the way on the ap- proach of the frigates, immediately to make I a short cruise; and therefore told the old fel- - low that I had waited upon him that morn- ing to take leave of: him, as I intended put- ting to sea that day with the purpose of mak- ing a short visit to the Havana, fom whence I should drop into Kingston on my return to Sicily; and now, my lads, I do intend dropping in there, to ascertain when and by what vessel our prey will leave the island. Notwithlstanding my anxiety to be there as soon as possible, I could not refrain, when I saw this vessel we are so fast :overhauling from gratifying you with the privilege of sat- isfying your laudable curiosity as to her car- go, &c. I have but one thing more to say- Are you satisfied?" The blood hounds expressed an affirmaive by giving what would pass among land-mne for three growls, hut on the blood-stdined deck of this devil's-den was received as cur- rent coin for three cheers. "' That's right, my hearties! and now all hands to your stations; but remember, when we board yonder craft show no quarters, un less you wish each of your interesting neclp graced with a hempen cravat. Remember 'dead men tell no tales,'"' which reach the ears of man,' he might have added; but their cries ascend to heaven, where the ever open ear of a just God hears their complaints, and will surely avenge their deaths. Although to his listeners his lips gave utterance to no such morality, his conscience (answer nob reader, that conscience ever Lecomes so tor pid that its sting is powerless) told him thai even now  the cries of the dead were ascend. ing to heaven from the lepths around him. The crew were nc w  al: their several sta   tiohs, and the schooner was rapidly coming up with' the ship, which, after various ma- nceuvres, in the vain hole of escaping her savage pursuers, had put away before the wind, fresh from the north-east, and was scud- ding before the breeze with all sail set. She being a fast sailer before the wind, proved nearly a match for the schooner, and Her- nandez and his crew feared that she might yet escape them. Hiauling a little more to the westward, and 'crowding on all his can- vas, Hernandez had the satisfaction of per- ceiving that he was fast heading her. For- tunately for those on board the ship, she had a good offing when., they first discovered the 'pirate, and by her maneuvres had gradually been driving the enemy farther down to lee- ward under the impression that he was try- ing to nead them off while she herself still maintained about the same distance to wind- ward. So. great was the interest of all those on board the schooner in the movements of the ship, that when she put away before the wind, and during the bustle on board their own vessel, in changing their coarse and set-' ting additional sail, they did' not perceive two black objects on the water in the wind's eye, at the stern of the ship; and while the chase was scudding under a press of canvas -ploughing her way with a fresh breeze through the water, and rushing on with what seemed to them incredible speed, they vented their spleen and disappointment in curses and oaths, the profanity of which would almost shock the ears of the father of blasphemies himself. All eves on board the pirate were intensely watching the progress of the ship -now uittering' fearful imprecations as she gained upon them, and now exulting in savage joy at the speedy prospect of over- hauling her. "Give her a gun, Pedro-let's see if long Tom can't make love to some of those sticks. Blast him! I believe the rascal really thinks to escape us. . --- n my eyes, you lubberly fellows!" said Hernandez, as long Tom bel- lowed. out. a mouthful of shot which harm- 'lessly passed over the decks of the ship. "Where's Oakum?" "Here, sir," replied the person in question. "Come, Bill, let's see if you can't bring come of those cursed sticks down!" "Aye, aye, sir," said Bill, who was lazily reclining on the fore-top-gallant deck, gazing intently at the ship, '; let Bill Oakum alone for that." So saying, he was on the point of springing up from the deck when a stream of fire issued from a port .amidships of the chase, and a heavy gun, well crammed with grape-shot, nails, spikes, and other missiles, dlischarged its contents full upon them. The vessels being now but a short distance apart, and the schooner's crowded decks being fully eilosed to the galling and unexpected fire, the slaughter was terrible. Hell and furies!" roared Hernandez, stamping with rage as he witnessed some dozen of his men, and those too, on whom he most lelied, slddenly fall lifeless upon the 4de i- By all, the sai ats in the calendar.   you rascals, you shall pay for this," contin- uedl he,.shaking his clenched fist at the doom. ed ship--"Pedro, give the scoundrels a good broadside and let every man prepare to make yonder decks swim with the blood of all aboard her!" In obedience to these orders, the balls from the schooner's guns rattled like hail against the side and along the riggingof the ship while the schooner's crew, smarting with their wounds and the loss of their com- rades, brandished their cutlasses, and, with horrid oaths, swore terrible'revenge. The ship's scuppers poured out as yet no blood- but onward she flew, like a frightened deer as'though she already felt the fangs of the bloodhound in pursuit, fast hold of her. ," Reserve your fire, Pedro, throw away no mole powder-and ball upoil them--we will have the satisfaction. of hearing their una- vailing cries for mercy, and witnessing their agonizing and dying struggles on their own decks. Let not another gun be discharged as it will deprive us of the pleasure of .wit- nessing, their deaths! No! after we have sufficiently tormented them we'll reserve their throats for our knives," said the black- hearted villian, partly soliloquising, partly in orders to his ofticer. The schooner hav- ing now approached sufficiently near for the purpose, the grapnels were thrown, which catching in the fore-rigging of the ship, made her fast alongside. "Board  all!" roared Hernandez, springing into the main- rigging, while the crew, rending the air with oaths and yells, that sounded as if the infer- nal regions,had vomited forth its legions of devils, clambered up the sides of the ship and springing on deck with flashing cutlasses, confronted--none  but their comrades! with savage ferocity they poured into the ca- bin and forecastle, but not a soul did they meet. The cage they had; indeed, fast and secure--but the birds had ftown. Maddened with rage and disapointment, they were more than half inclined to turn their swords upon their commander, when a cry from Bill, ol "Never-flinch," restore.! them to their sen. ses. The schooner, with Pedro and some half-dozen of the crew on board, had been cast loose from the ship (whose halyards had all been cut 'on the moment of boarding) and was now under easy sail at some little dis- tance, with just sufficient headway to keep up with the ship, whose reduced sail impell- ed her but slowly through the water. Find- ing no throats for their knives; X nless they used their own, which, nnfortunately,they did not seem inclined to,a portion of these ruffians descended to the cabin for the purpose of ransacking for plunder,'while others tore ofl the fore-hatch and descended to the hold; but hardly had a moment elapsed, when all those below rushed impetuously to the deck, 'crying "Fire and powder!" and ere another. instant not a soul was left on board the ship -all hands having tumbled themselves over the rails into the sea and commenced swim- ming for their lives, to the schooner, wh'ch, to avoid the danger (already ,'uspected bw     Pedro. from the tumnltuous leapingoveroard :f the crew,) had sheered off, while her boats were cast adrift for the purpose o allow ing the unwilling bathers to pick themselves up. Unforfunately for the good of manklind, the sharks were either asleep or out visiting; but ere these worthies could reach the boats a heavy black mass of smoke puffed up from the ship-then a deafening report- and the next moment the gallant ship, riven to pieces, was flying in countless fragments through the air, and dropping in the water all around them; ever and anon, some misshapen looking piece of timber, in its fall, famliharly rapping on the head one of the swimming rascals, and sending him to the bottom on the instant. Neither did the schooner escape some of the effects of the blow-up-for the mainmast of the ship having been shot igh in the air, and there performing sundry evo- lutions, as if to be sure of its mark, made a diagonal sweep for the water, and, in ts  fall, most 'lovingly embraced the foremast of the schooner, and both spars simultaneously, and in the most cordial manner, stretched p themselves on the surface of the waters Not a more sulkily did ever the whipped lion lav himself down in his iron-bouud cage, than t did the crew of the schooner, after regaining s their vessel, with folded arms and down cast i looks, listlessly throw themselves upon the h decks. Not a word escaped their lips, bu ti from time to time, as their gaze fell on the at sttmp of the foremast, their breasts would it swell, while a half-muttered curse struggled ta for utterance between their clenched teeth ke Hernandez, who had immediately descended c to the cabin, and changed his dress, now ap- m peared on deck, followed by the steward with h a bucket of rum. "Come, my lads," said he, "we've had a a hard time of it, but there's no use in cry- fo ing about it. It might have been worse for th us; had that d.-d ship blown up two min- ag' utes sooner, we should all have lost the ca number of our mess. As it is, let's splice hin the main brace, and drink death to our foes." ro One by one the sulky crew roused them- as selves from  their stupor, and walked up tohe the bucket, where, having supplied them- selves with a generous bumper, their spirits wh began to revive.  Hernandez, watching for  this indication of returning good-humor, or- cep dered all hands below to change their wet and clothes, and return to the deck as soon as ed possible to clear the wreck.      whi "Aye, aye, sir!" sung out Oakum, as he oft nimbly sprang below, followed by all hands, cre whose good humor, already partially restored, we was mtch accelerated. by the liveliness of emp their comrade.             Hav "  Aye, aye, sir-we'll rig the hussey out in sar the twinkling of a rope's end, and I say Bob, of t my old boy, can't you tell us how quick that tivit Is?" said Bill, bringing his hand with no toge gentle force (as he descended the hatch) gala upon the shoulder of a comrade who  had and 'seen servie,"e and whose back had not It- the n frequently been made acquait te4 with the, east i g , 4^^   oard ' cat," alias the rope's-end. Nc )nmer ha boats the men mustered below than Some d: ze low- more than composed his former listeners (and lIves who, the reader will remember, were inter. rupted by the cry of "sail ho!") now ,the gathered round Bill, requesting to be sworn ing; and made acquainted with his plass, and mats, also those of their commander, which Bill up professed to have discovered. Now, Bill rt- knew that Hernandez had among the crew ven (seventy in alD about two dozen men whom, ents by heavy bribes, he had appointed as spies all over their comrades-and, although the rest pen of the crew were unacquainted with this fact,. arly still Bill had discovered them, and cautioned ing th( others to be on their guard when they the were present. This party had come on board ape in a squad, when last at Port Royal, and the were as yet ignorant of the many pleasing igh eccentricities of their mess-mates. Seeing ro- these also below, and singling out one of a them, who, with apparent unconcern, was its doffing his wet clothes, Bill hailed him- of  "I say, comrade, I s'pose you know our ly, rules 'board this craft, which must be comr ed plied with before we admit as mess-mates ot any new comers." av  The seaman he addressed was evidently in the chief of the new squad. He was a ng short, chunky, bull-necked, ill-natured look- st ing fellow, whose head, with its matted coarse he hair, resembled a tough curly knot some. ut times seen swelling out from the trunk of an he ancient, weather-beaten oak; his face with Id its many deeply marked-scars, enormous, d tangled, dirty looking mustaches and whis h. kers, presented an appearance'which would d certainly ensure him a free and welcome ad z- mittance into the infernal regions as soon as h he might choose to go; for indeed, such a beau-ideal of all the terrors with which inm. d agination invests theoe regions, could not be - found so fully combined and expressed, as in rthat countenance. This interesting person. age, whom we shall call Diable, (for thus he called himself, and he certainly resembled him   both outwardly, and inwardly,) turned round and expressed his ignorance, as well as his desire to be made acquainted with them. "Well, then, heave alongside, my hearty, while I inform you." Bill then repeated the oath to them, (e. cepting the latter, part, relating to himself) ed it to his lips and swore never to peach which being interpreted means not to inform of their comrades. This ceremony over, the crew separated, and, hastily changing their wet clothes, were, in a few moments, actively empioyed in putting the schooner to rights Having  a spare foremast and other extra spars on board, they soon got out the stump of the old one, and with almost incredible ac- tivity, had the new one set up in its place, together with all the rigging; top and top. gallant-masts aloft, with their yards acrss, and their several sails sheeted home.-and the schooner, with'all sail set, heading south easterly., gaily dashed aside the w'aars a:ar   looked as fresh as though'she were just out of dock. This unusual alacrity may be accounted for by the announcement, on their re-appear-  4nce on deck, of a sail far off in the eastern horizon, to use the words ot' the lookout in the main top, " loomed up like a cruiser." After the schooner had been underweigh a short time, the lookout again hailed the deck and reported the stranger hove-to aii getting out the boats. "What in the devil's name is he doing that for, off there?/ Is he going to fish, or is he simple enougfto think his barges can head off this saucy craft? Give your eyes a fresh rub, and see if. he's not hoisting, in in- stead of getting out, his boats," said Her-. nandez, while at 'the same time he ordered the vessel to be kept off a little as a matter of precaution-not doubting that the stranger was lying to for the purpose of receiving  on board those who had escaped from the  ship; and this opinion was in a few mo- ments fully confirmed by the lookout report- ing that the stranger had filled away and  was standing to the north-west with more  sail on. "Aye, aye, let them go, they, may  thank their fortunes that they are so far to ( windward; for were they not, I'd 'tickle the  throats of every mother's son of them-and  d-n me if I would ble such a sleepy lubber  as to let them again pull away in their o boats, under my very nose, without giving fa them a few grapes to chew!"  b ,                    h CHAPTER XVII.

I remem- bers one time when we were having a pretty hard tug at the enemy on his own decks, one cold drizzly morning, old 'at him' was slashing away larboard and starboard at a whole squad of Mounshears, when who should he see but little Tommy, him as was the captain's under-clark; (that eye Tommy was a rum-one for fighting-small timbers, but as lively as an eel-and a great pet ol the whole ship's company) well, Tommy you see, had been on his beam ends for several days with a bad cold, moored hard and fast to him, and when the enemy hove in 'sight he was in his berth, fast asleep the Captain tholight, where he remained till orders were given to board, when he contrived to dodge the captain, and, as I was saying, the first he saw of him afterwards was on the enemy's deck, hard aboard on him, hewing away like a good, one at two of the enemy's middies. 'Go aboard this instant, sir,' said old ' at him' (while he kept cutting away-at the Mounshears) to Tommy. Just as one of the middies bit the deck, Aye, aye, sir, said Tommy, 'I'm   going, sir'-and :he other middy rolled into 'the lee-scuppers, and Tommy sprung :nto the rigging of the Charley-Mang just as--bu, 'vast there, I've drifted out of my course; clap a stopper there, messmates, while I splice the main brace and tack ship-here Antone, pass the can I! After taking a pretty generous portion o its contents, and drawing the back of his hand across his lips, he continued- "]Let's me see, when was I when I struck     tdrift? Aye aye, I relnembers-the stranger on our weather-quarter, coming down on us with all his kite, set. Well, old 'at him, not wishing to give the chap any unneces- sary trouble, run up to the peak old GeorgyIs bunting, and bore up ,to meet the feller half way, for it seemed sartain he wanted to have a contab with us. No ;ooner did the stranger get a sight of what was flying at our peak, than he run up Mounshear's ' foor de loose (which I s'pose means loose floors) and opened his bow guns upon us.  We were all at our quarters, and old 'at him) let Mounshear blaze away awhile to get his hand in, for the old feller was too perlite to lake the advantage of him. After working up a piece to windward, we laid our main- top-sail to 'ie mast, and waited for him to come alongside. We iay with our head about sou-sou-west, a little on his starboard bow, while all the time Mounshear kept blazing away at us, his plums flying over  our heads and not doing any damage. Well, X you see we were getting kinder wolfish, and t could hardly keep from breaking orders and t letting drive at him. Old 'at him,' who saw how impatient we were, said, 'Hold on, my boys, I'll give you a chance by and  oye to show vour teeth.' "He was now close aboard on us, and, t running down under our starn, thought to u give us a beautiful starn-raker-but old 'at u him' was too quick for him, and the Charley- n Mang, too, was the quickest working craft b that ever floated. So filling away, we open- sl ed our larboard broadside, and, as we wore si ship, gave him another dose from our star- a board, which carried away his mainmast, p then passing under his starn, and giving him h a raking o' grape, we run alongside yard- tr arm and yard-atrm.

The pocr devils fought like he men, but it was no use--for you see, mess- re, mates, we'mustered too strong for 'em. So su arter they had thinned our numbers about wA one half, and their commander and 1st and an 2d Left-tenants had run out their logs and bu were lying on their bean ends, surrounded pa by a File of friends and foes, our first Luffi ev seized the ensign halyards and hauled the so bulting down on deck--and so the fun was mj Oer. So b-isy had we been, hacking awa Bo U  each other, that we didn't perceive the sm   rer enemy's ship ha:' been drinking like a fial us (for his hull was awfully peppered)--anl we. ni, had just time to get the prisoners aboard s- with the wounded, and sheer clear on him, "'s when down he went starn foremost.  On lf mustering the 'ship's company arter the ac. re tion, we found we had lost three hundred out er of seven hundred men,'and that the enemy k, had lost the like number out of six hundred ie so you see, messmates, we hadn't much to s) crow over, arter all. I disremember the e name of the enemy's ship; it was about hal: tn a fathom long, and. had one of them ere is d-d 'floors' in it. Arter repairing dam to ages, we stood away for old England, with a g cracking nor-wester on our larboard quarter, - and in about ten days made Land's End, and o stood up channel. 1  ' Same night (whicn was darn as a niggerls i pocket) about seven bells, I was leaning t against the hammock nettings, half dosing, r when a little knee-high-to-aaquid-of-tobacco , middy came up astarn on me and gave me a kick, calling me a d-d sleepy lubber. Well, the kick I didn't mind, seeing as how it might have been an accident   but the I d-di sleepy lubber' raised my dander; so taking him by the slack of his breeches I hove him over tne side Into the water, and then, not wishing to grace the yard-arm with an extra pennant, I followed in his wake. The little feller kept up a devil of a mewing, until he was picked up by the ship's boat. Fortunately I overhauled a floating spar, to which I snugly moored myself, stretching out fore and aft of it like death to a dead nigger. In a few minutes the boat passed close aboard'on me, but as they didn' hail, 'twarn't' my duty to put them to the trouble of coming alongside. Well, they poked about sometime in the dark for me when I heard the officer in the boat say, 'it's no use, the d-d. rascal has gone to Davy Jones' and saved us the trouble of shooting his carcass.' So they pulled aboard, and the ship again stood up channel. "Never mind," says I to myself, "I'm d--  if I aint captain of this craft any how; so here's for a cruise on my own account. Well, you see, messmates, I hadn't much trouble trimming the sails of my craft; I just laid myself keel up on hw deck, and first with my starboard and then my larboard flipper in the water (for she swam decks down) I shot along steamboat fashion in the wind's eye, at the rate of a knot an hour for about two hours, when my steam gave out, and not having any anchors handy, I put her away for the French coast, and spent the remainder of the night under bare poles. At sunrise, next morning, I began to think it was high time to relieve the watch on deck, and that, being captain, was well enough, but being officers and the whole ship's corn pany beside, 'twarn't so pleasant. Howsorm ever, I was determined to make the best of it, so getting up a voyage of discovery among my pockets, I fell in with a clever bit of Bolona sars-age, one ship biscuit, and a small consarn of the ra-al lamaky. Arte   asaking this discovryg, I iped all hands to breakfast, anid soon made clear decks of it. About this time a strange sail hove in sight on my larboard bow, beating down channel. Not being n a situation to show fight, and at the same time not caring to have him think I was able to help myself, I run up a signal oftistress, which arter a while was made by the stranger who stood alongside: she proved to be the English brig Somerset, bound up the Straits, so I concluded to ship for the voj age. "One night, arter we had been at sea about ten days, one of the hands came up to me, as I was leaning over the bows, and says he-. Jack, I s'pose you'4 like to fall in with some British cruiser and try your chance at the fore-yard?' 'That's just what ][ shouldn't like to do though, Bob,' said I.  'Well,' says he, 'I s'pose you know that when we arrive at Gibraltar, our captain will give you up?' 'I'm d-d if he does though,. said I. sI'll send him on a cruise after the middy, first.' 'That's your sort, my old boy,' says he, tip us your flipper--I told 'em they might count on you.' ( Then; drawing close alongside on me, he told me the capltain had thirty thousand dol- lars in specie on board-i- that he, with half a dozen more of the crew had formed a plan for getting possessiontof the brig and the money, and then' steering for the. coast' of Africa for a cargo of Black Ivory-said he had been for some time in command of a 'aver, but having lost his vessel at sea, he was picked up and carried into London, with dx of his men. There, falling in with this craft, which was a very fast sailer,'they had shipped as seamen on board of her, conceal- ing their weapons about, their hulls, (and here he showed me the handles of a heavy pair of pistols and the hilt of a large knife stuck in his belt,) with the determination to take the vessel the first opportunity. ' But,' said he, 'I took a fancy to you, and thought you would like to try your fortune with us, seeing as how you had got yourself into a scrape. Now, what say you, my man, are you ready to take those little barkers (pull- ing out of his breeches pocket a pair of pis- tols) and walk aft with, me to the job at once?' ' Hark'ee, captain,' said I, 'I never likes to ship till I have a. fair understanding; if so be we all share equal, I'll go with you to the devil's own kitchen.' 'Oh. sartain,' says he, .'I likes you the better for that, so take the barkers and make yourself easy about the division, for we all far! alike.' "Then, giving me the pistols, he said: 'Pedro has charge of the wheel; he's one of us, so we're all right there. Carlos and myself will take kere of the captain and lst mate, while you must contrive to get the ld mate overboard without any noise, and   the rest of us will, lobk ou for the men below.' 'Aye aye,' whispered four more of the crew at my back, drawing their knives, ai they were about descending the forecastle. 'Vast men, hold on till Jack settles the second mate. Jack' says he to me,  as soon as you get him over the side, whistle; and you men be lively with your knives!' "So saying, he and Carlos made sail- for the cabin as noiseless as mice, and I, leaving the four men at the forecastle-hatch, walked 'aft on the leeward side, and brought up 'longside the main rigging, with a marline spike in my right hand. Arter a little while I reached over and seemed to be vety busy looking at the lanyards. What's the matter there, Jack?' says ,the second mate, who was walking the quar ter-deck. "' This ere lanyard seems to be stranded, sir, says I. At that he came alongside, and as he reached over to see for himself, I fetched him a blow on the head with the marline spike, and he tipped overboard as quiet as a lamb. Well, then, you see, I tipt, 'em the whistle, when directly pop! pop-! went the barkers in the cabin. The firs t mate was killed the first fire by Carlos, but dut leader missed the captain of the brig, who, springing out of his berth, let drive at 'him, and wounded him in the arm; but the second firehit him in the side, and lie sprang to the deck, where a plum from my pistol laid him on his back as dead as Julio's sis- t:.r, (though I 'don't see why she should be  more dead than any body else, but so them ere college chaps had it.) The boys in the forecastle seemed to have more trouble than we had; so our new captain, Captain Her- nandez, (the same as now commands 'this ere craft,) ordered Carlos and myself down fore- ard to lend 'em a hand, for they made as much noise as the devil's own gang, but by the time we got there all was as still as a calm after a storm. There lay six of the brig's crew,besides two of our men-while , the other two were holding on to a berth, trying to get breath. It seems they had some pretty hard fighting afore they got through, for when they had got down in the forecastle, the first one they'knifed made such a caterwauling as to rouse the, others, and all springing, up in their berths, three of them received the knives'of our boys, which set- tied 'em at once. The other two got their feet, knocked over two of our party, got their knives, and contrived each to kil. his man, and wound the others, though but slightly, before they were knocked under, with a plum in the head of each. We now proceeded to throw the bodies overboard, and to clean up the brig. Arter doing this, and washing out the cabin and forecastle, and scrubbing out all the marks of blood, Her- nandez destroyed the brig's papers and pro- duced others, making it appear that he was Capt. Smith, of the brig Somerset, in ballast friom Liverpool, bound to Havana. Says he, i'Boys, remember, if we are boarded we are     thirty days out, and lost n-je of our men with the scurvy.' Arter gettin' our story, we hove the brig to, and brought on deck the money boxes, and emptyin' 'em on the quar- ter deck. made a division of the spoils. There was thirty thousand dollars in all, and only six on us to share it; so each took his five thousand and stowed it away in his chest. This done, the captain says, ' Well, my boys, we have made a good beginning at all events, but we are too short-handed to steer for the coast; what say you for making a run for Cuba, where, without any difficulty we can get men enough of the true grit  Arter that, then for the ivory.' It warn't no use, you see, for us to think of doing any- thing without more men; besides, we wanted a few bull logs and a chap amidships, like that there long Tom, so it was agreed we should run for Cuba. "About daybreak next morning we got tnder weigh with a ten knot breeze from the norard, which before noon had hauled to nor and eastard, and blew a clever close-reefed- topsail breeze, the old Somerset shooting through the water like a dolphin in the dev- il's chowder time over Fryin' pan Shoals, (them ere shoals, I spose you know, got the hail of ' Fryin'-pan' from the sarcumstance of the devil's comin' to anchor there once a year with his fryin'-pan, and havin' a chow- der of dolphins) till about dark, when it be- gan to lull, and by twelve o'clock at night it wras as still as a dead chicken. At daylight text morning the fog was as thick as mud; t but when -that lifted, as the devil would have I ;t, there we were within half pistol shot un-  ter the lee of a British frigate. The wind t pringing up at this moment. we thought we ( rould try our heels; but as soon as the fri.-  gate saw this, she fired a gun athwart our a fore foot as a perlite insinivation that she a would like to make our acquaintance; but h perceiving that we didn't care much our- t selves to keep company with her, she let us a have half-a-dozen guns which brought our M fore-top-mast down on deck and the craft up a in the wind. Well, you see 'twas no use con- o tending any longer, so we backed our main- n top-sail, and waited for her boars. In a few b minutes two on 'em put off with a leftenant g in each, and as bad luck would have it, they tl boarded us onf the side where our second mate w had taken his departure, who had the cursed u ill manners not to take his brains with him, t but left them with a sprinkling of blood on o the lanyards. At first the officers pretended s not to see this, but jumped on deck with go about twenty men, well armed. The 1st Luff t hailing Hernandez, requested to see the cap- g, tain. He:nandez answered him as perlite dE as a Frenchman, told him he had the honor tt to command the craft, and was very sorry to or give him so much trouble, but he had mis- de taken the frigate for an American.   hi 'It may be so, sir,' says he, but it is not de often that an American carries that flag at ea bs peak. What brig is this, sir?'   P "The Somerset,' says Hernandez.   in 'I'll trouble you for your papers, sir. d   en Humph!' says the officer, arter looking ofe ve the papers, What has become of Captail he Carter, who had command of this vessel, the r- - day she sailed from London?' s.  "Captain Carter was taken sick, sir, and id couldn't perform the voyage-he was there- is fore sent on shore, and at the owner's request is ' I was induced to take charge of her.' y  "Hark'ee, sir,' said the officer to Hernan- "dez, ' you have a load sufficiently burdensome :r on your conscience without increasing it by a falsehood. I know this brig well, sir; I was r, in London at the Custom House when my ? friend Captain Carter cleared. I repaired on 't board witfi him, and waited till the topsails - were sheeted home, and until you came on d board with several other men. I remember e you well, sir-it's a matter of no consequence e whether you recognise me, bit I remember Captain Carter being detained some consid- t- erable time by you and your comrades; and- the brig's side bears strong evidence as to r what has becomz of mv friend.' "Now you see, messmates, this was all Gospel truth, for we had been on a spree - among them ere little frigates ashore, and didn't come down till we were fetched; and arter the officer mentioned the sarcumstance, I remembered seeing him and the Captain grappelling flippers just as we got under-  weigh. "Hernandez hardly waited for him to fin ish his yarn afore he pulled out a pistol fot the purpose of freeing himself of this trou- blesome witness; but afore he could fire, the pistol was knocked from his hand and a blow from the officer's sword brought him to the deck. In a jiffy we were all secured with our arms lashed astern on us, our weapons all taken from us, and Captain Hernandez and all hands put in the boats and carried aboard the frigate. There we were over- hauled again, heavily ironed, and secured below. They put an officer, and ten men aboard the brig and ordered her for Jamaky, where the frigate was bound. As we were all stowed together, we agreed upon a plan 'of escape, not liking the idee of dancing on nothing just to gratily a mess of land lub- bers. To give 'em the slip aboard'the fri- gate was no use a thinking cf, so we let that go; but as we were bound to Port Rial, where Hernandez had many friends, we made up our minds to go to the jug peaceably and; trust to fortune and our wits for the matter of getting clear from that. Nothing of con- sequence occurred on the passage, we had a good whole-sail breeze all the way, and twenty days arter we come aboard, the fri- gate dropped anchor in Port Rial. The next day we were carried ashore and confined in the Guard House. I forgot to say that two on us at a time were permitted to come on deck every day for an hour or so. Well, it happened that Hernandez aLd me was on deck together the morning we doubled the eastern pint of Jamaky, and passing Rocky Pint, we obsarved a neat little rakish- ook- ing craft lying ir Port Morant. Put that down on your log, messmates, 'cause, you see   I ahall have something to say consarning hat craft. Howsuindever, we are now in the guard-house-it might be nine o'clock when we came to anchor there, and before noon all hands on shore had heard of our ar- rival; of course we had a good many come t, see us through the grating. Hernandez watched 'em all-bye and bye, I seed him cross his cut-water with his starboard fore-  finger, and a big-lipped, black-looking son of a gun, outside, did the same! and immediate- ly made sail. Hernandez now brightened up and was quite lively till arter dark, when as I was standing near the grating I felt something shoved through which fell heavi- ly to the floor. Hernandez grappled them, (for they were two packages) and pulling off the sheathing found a small dark-lantern, matches, half a dozen knives, and some few odds. and ends very useful iin removing bars and ruffles; also a note, which, after produ- cing the glim we found contained the very pleasant information that at twelve that night some friends with half a dozen spare mules would be passing if we chose to take a ride to Port Morant. Now you must know, com- rades, that riding a mule's back is much more ship-shape than dancing on nothing, with anchors aloft-so we went at it with a will; and at twelve that night-that ere night was a beautiful, dark, rainy night, it seemed to have been made a. purpose; it was as dark as Ery-bus, I don't know who he was though, but I've hearn tell he was a d-d black chap-well at twelve that night we boarded the mules and made sail at the rate of ten knots an hour, and before sunrise the next morning we were aboard the schoon- er Saucy Jack, under command of Capt. Hernandez, with a crew of seventy five men, off Rocky Pint with a good stiff breeze.- All this came about in consequence of that ere big-lipped nigger, who knew Hernandez, and who owned the Saucy Jack, and wanted a commander for her. We cruised for some time among the Leeward Islands, but not. finding, very good picking, beat up to the windward, taking a look round St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Grenada, Tobago, and Trini- dad-and then, running west along the Spanish Main, we fell in with a ship off Curacoa, with some twenty rich Jews aboard as passengers. Easing these chaps of the troublesome care of their jewels, and some ten thousand dollars in specie, we lashed the whole consarn toge;ler, captain, crew, and passengers, secured them in the hold, scuttled the ship, and half an hour arter we boarded her, they were as quiet as drowned kittens. Cruising along the coast up to and hugging the Mosquito shore, we crossed the bay of Honduras, and stood for Cape An- tonio, on the sou-western end of Cuba.- (doming up with the Cape, we entered the Gulf of Mexico, where we fell in with a ship from Vera Cruz, bound for England, with a potd lot of shiners aboard. We discovered her anout eight o'clock in the morning, about fie leagues off on our weather-bow, stand- las athwart our course v th a fresh westerly   wind. So we clapped on our rags, low and aloft, and made sail for her: no sooner di they discover us but they packed on sai arter sail, till she was completely covered with canvas-the cursed thiig sailed like the wind, and led us a dance of some fift) miles, when she bore away for,Buena Vista. But the Saucy Jack was too light-heeled for him; so. standing for the Colorados, ,we began to overhaul them hand over fist.- Well, you see they had a couple of six. pounders aboard the ship; so they run 'en out aft and made starn chasers 'on 'em and damn my eyes if them ere fellers didn'ti make good use on 'em too. The fust dis- charge keeled up three of our men, and twe more on 'em lost a lower spar each. We used our guns too; but they hadn't been sealed, and upon the fust discharge one on 'em busted and killed two more; howsom- ever, tother gun carried away the ship's top- mast by the hoard, (we had six six-pounders,  three on a side,) so we had done some good any how. Being a little skittish of firing- again till arter we had given 'em an over- hauling, we stopped firing, but the ship kept 'blazing away at us, making sad havoc aboard, and killing six more of our men and wounding five others, afore we came up with her. She had a complement of fourteen: men all told, beside a beautiful piece, with woman's gear on, as-a,passenger. This ere passenger was the captain's wife, I s'Bose, for she stood by him like a hero, and shiver my timbers, messmates, if I ever fell in with such a she-devil afore. I'm d-d if she didn't have a belt round her tiny timbers, with a brace of ship pistols and a large' knife stuck in't, beside a cutlass in her small, delicate flipper. Now you know them ere female women are a dangerous kind o' craft to attack, even when unarmed, so you may swear we didn't think to board her with- out the loss of some claret. The ship's company were all armed to the teeth, and determined to die like fighting cocks, but 'twarn't no use, for we mustered (even arter our loss) fifty-six men, and they only four- teen, beside that ere she-devil, which you may safely set down as equal to six more and then be inside the mark. "Howsomedever, we ranged  alonside. She was a craft of 'bout five hufndred tons and very high out o' water, while our craft sat very low; so we had to scramble up our rigging to get aboard. In doing this, about a dozen of our brave fellows came tumbling on deck, with a leaden pill in 'em, and afore we could get aboard on her, nearly as many more slipped their cables and made sail fo, Davy Jones' locker. After a while, we con- trived to get on her decks, where we had it hot and heavy, you may be sure. Hernan- dez made at the captain, but a blow from his consort athwart his bow port, laid him on deck with the loss of some of his ivory, and in falling he struck his head afoul the comb ing of the hatch, which kept him  quiet more than an hour. The chaps handled their cutlasses, as though .hbr had been bori C     wi'h 'em, and hewed away at us with a will. The captain of the ship had just cut one of our men clean down amidships, and his con- sort had al ho let day-light in one of our com- rades, when a ball from my barker lodged between ne blinkers of the captain; and at the same minute that ere she-devil's cutlass whizzed through the air over my head and taii open the starboard side of my figure- head; and when I struck the deck ii I didn't see stars, may I be keel-hauled. Arter I fell, seeing as how all her companions were dead, she seized the body of her hus- tand, and brandishing her knife, (for she broke her cursed cutlass over my head) sprang over the rail with the body, as though 'twarn't more than a feather, into the sea; a comrade, who swore she would make a first rate messmate, (the more fool he! why I'd sooner grapple with a whole fleet of devils than with one of them ere female women) jumped into the water and made arter her; but just as he was ranging 'long- side, a well-aimed blow frbm her knife fixed him, and all three went to Davy Jones' in company. Well! here was a pretty fix. Howsomedever, we got out the blunt, and was just passing the last box aboard the schooner, when we discovered a sail to wind- ward, coming down on us, hand over fist. From the cut of her sails, we took her to be a cruiser. It was now about four o'clock in the -arternoon, the ship distan't about two leagues, and we close in with the Colorados. As we were about making sail, the ship fired a gun for us to heave to; and as our rigging and spars were much cut up, and we could see no chance of escape, we put the schooner before the wind, and took to our boats. The ship in chase proved a very fast sailer, and, as we hoped, supposed we were still aboard, and made sail for the schooner, giving us a chance to claw off. Before we lost sight on her she had overhauled the schooner, and,I s'pose felt kind-a-disappointed-like, -in not finding any on us, aboard-but curse 'em! they got the blunt. About daylight, next morning, we landed at Betrays Cove, and separated, and I didn't see Hernandez again till about two months ago, I happlid to be at Kingston; where he was figuring away as a Count Corregio. When I first fell in with him, he was walking with a Count Mont--- something, the name was about a fathom long, and- curse me if I can recollect it. How- somever, that's neither here nor there. Her- andez, or Count Corregio, as he chose to cal himself, gave me a look, as much as to say I remember you-but mum!' So mum it was, and I 'bout ship and stood arter him, under easy sail. In a few minutes they separated, and arter t'other Count was hull down, I haul'l 'longside. Hernandez then told me of this schooner under his command, laying off Port Rial-that he wanted ten or fifteen more men-that the Count who had just left was as rich as a Jew-that he had a tight little frigate of a darter, and was about sailing for England, and that he meant to gat possession of both the gal and the   money," (here Oakum slyly ant unperceivet byr his comrades, gave one of his messmates a slight punch in the side) " and wound up his yarn by asking me if I wouldn't fina him the men he wanted and ship myself; so you see I came aboard with my squad-and so, messinates, take a round turn there, for that's the end of my yarn, and here's lucti and a better acquaintance to all on us," said Diablo, as he drained the can. CHAPTER XVIII. The schooner had now come up with Cat Island, and passing it on the North-east, stood South, leaving Conception Island on their larboard till up with Yuma or Long Island. Running along the latter they stood  South-east course until opering Crooked Island passage; entering this. and giving Diana's Reef on their starboard, and the South-Western part of Crooked Island on their larboard, good berths, they ran for Hen- rage; being up with this, and steering more Southerly till up with Cuba, when, doubling Cape Maize, hugging the Southern shore and doubling Cape Burns, they entered Hoba -Bay, where they let go their anchor close un- dfr the land. After seeing everything snug, Hernandez called his men and thus address. ed them. "   My lads, I am now going to be absent about a fortnight; we have had a hard time of it this cruise, but I hope on my return to bring you some cheering accounts. If I am not much mistaken, old Father de Castro must be about taking his departure for Eng- land with his money bags, and it becomes necessary for me -to visit Kingston that we may know what ship he takes, and when he sails; and if under convoy, the distance he is to be convoyed; he is a bird worth pluck- ing, and I trust you will see the necessity of a little more patience on your part, that we may be enabled toipick his feathers with the least risk to ourslives. Having got this chap's dollars in our lockers, we will then steer for the coast of Africa, and avoid these d-d meddling cruisers, who will undoubt- edly scour these seas pretty effectually, and, having done it to their hearts' content, will then haul off and leave the coast clear for us. While I am absent from you, I trust you will cheerfulB obey the orders of Pedro, who I doubt not will do every thing in his power o make your duties as light as possible. Our next cruise, you are aware, will proba- bly be a long one, and the craft needs a thorough overhauling. I need not add that your own safety depends much upon the manner in which you assist Pedro. I have spun my yarn, you may now make for the shore for a frolic, all except the gig's crews" --which was composed of Diablo. and seven of the companions that came with him. The crew, now released from a.. -estraint. and banishing from their 'minds th muti. nous thoughts, at least for the present m   ooner touc ed their feet upon terra firma, than they gave the most noisy and uproari- ous demonstrations of their disposition to make the most of their liberty 'on shore-- and these hardy, though it must be confess-, ed, .degenerate sons cf the ocean, with all the wild merriment of a bevy of six-year-old urchins, just emnerging'ifrom the awful pre- cincts of the village school, rolled and tumbled upon the grass in the most gambol- somre and mirth-provoking manner. Leaving them, however, to the unrestrained enjoy- ment of their liberty, we will again repair on board the schooner, and see what that group on the quarter deck are about. Well, Diablo, have you got the sail rigged' in the gig, the grog aboard, and all ready?" "Aye, aye, sir," responded Diablo," all ready, sir." 's Well then, jump aboard," said Hernan- dez, and, turning to Pedro, he added, "Car- tollo will keep you informed of the move- ments of any cruiser that may visit this neighborhood before I get back, which will probably be within a fortnight." So saying, he jumped into the boat, which immediately pulled off and stood along the coast to the westward, bound for Yateno, where resided an individual by the name of Cartollo, jointly interested with Hernandez in the schooner. Yateno being distant about twenty-eight miles, they, with the; aid of oars and sail, arrived there in four or five hours after quitting the vessel. Here they found Cartollo, who was not, however, in ;he best temper, when he heard of their mishaps-but upon HernanJez informing, him of the prospect of getting old De' Castro's dollars, he brightened p rapidly; and from cursing and swearingyat his stu- pidity in allowing the ship's company to es- cape, he became as humble and obsequious as a slave, while his avaricious soul already, coqtemplatei the hoards- within his reach. Cartollo now embraced Hernandez's plan with alacrity-and, in a few moments, was, bustling about, preparing for their departure on board one of two fast sailing luggers be- longing to him, and now lying at anchor close in shore, ready for sea, and well sup- plied with stores. As Hernandez and his men stepped on board, while Cartollo pro- mised that he would immediately get the other ready and cruise round the neighbor- hood till his return, and should he fall in with any armed vessel, would send them off on the wrong scent. .Hernandez, who knew Cartollo's shrewdness, doubted not his ability or his disposition to do this-there- fore, making his mnind easy on this score, he got undeeweigh and stood for Jamaica, and the next morning dropped anchor off Analto, on the north side of the Island, about twenty- five miles due north of Kingston. Assuming i the dress and title he wore when last intro- duced to our readers at Kingston-namely,  Count Corregio-he procured a mule. at Analto, and set out on his way thither,  where, not long after, he arrived safely. In due course of time, the London papers I 4   announced the following intelltgeace. hfaded in large capitals': "ANOTHER   DARING  OUTRAGE OF \ HE NOTORIOUS RODERIGO!  'By the arrival at this port last even:ng of the ship Madonna, Captain Fishe, from Jamaica, with the officers and crew of the British ship Downs, Captain Smith, which vessel was bound from Kingston to America, with powder, and was burnt at sea, we gain the following particulars, politely handed us by Captain Smith. ) "We sailed from Kingston on the 15th ult., with a fine eight knot breeze from the N. E., which lasted, with occasional lulls. till midnight, when it fell calm. The next morning it breezed up again form the same quarter.-and about eight o'clock, Watling's Island, bearing S. E. distant about five leagues, discovered a suspicious looking sail, close in with the land, standing for us. Not liking her appearance, I crowded all the sail. The craft, which was a 'long. low, rakish looking schooner,' filled with men, and from the description of the Mcteoi evidently the same, gained on us fast. Seeing all chance of escape hopeless, and knowing the tender mercies of these rascals. we adopted a'plan to save our own lives and des troy our enemies, which, so far as we were concerned, proved successful; but as regardls the pirates, not so much as we had hoped. Having a six-pounder on board, we loaded it heavily with powder, bullets, spikes and nails, and then run it out on the star- board side, amidships. Having carefuily noticed the rate at which the schooner was overhauling us, and calculating as nearly as possible the time that would elapse before she could come up, we made a fuse leading to the cannon, intending it should discharge when the schooner would be near and abeam of us. We also bored a hole in a keg no powder between decks, forward and aft, o both of which we attached slow matches of sufficient length to burn until the pirates should board; then, getting the boats out on the larboard side, and putting in compass, quadrant, spy glass, water and provisions, we put the ship before the wind, lighted the matches, and jumped into our boats, pulling in the wind's eye. As soon as the pirates saw the ship before the wind, they also put away, and so intent were they in overhaul- ing her that fortunately they did not perceive us. All eyes were bent on the two vessels, while we pulled for our lives, expecting every moment to see the schooner put about and give us chase. . We were somewhat anxious too, to see how our friends on board the ship would carry out our plans. After pulling 'some considerable distance, we rested on our oars, and taking the glass I watched the fast receding vessels with the most in- tense anxiety. Now, imagination would picture the dim outline of a white cloud of smoke curling slowly and sluggishy above the deck, and then the rapid and painfti pulsations of my heart would almost deprive me of the power of sight, meanwhile in deo     suspense we were waiting to catch the souud of the explosion. But no-the smoke, it such it was, has disappeared, and the two vessels are fast nearing each other. Now is a fine chance,' we exclaimed, as the schooner was broadside to, less than pistol- shot listant. The schooner fired, but alas  our plans were apparently frustrated--the watches must have gone out. .Again I see a faint curl of smoke rising from the ship. Am I agaiu mis;taken? . Thank God. No! A dense cloud of fire is belched out with volcanic force from the ship's-side, and the old bull-dog has hurled his defiance at them. "Turning the glass to the schooner it was evident from the confusion on board that the gun had done fearful execution. The schooner now fired a broadside, and soon after'ranged alongside the ship. The pi- rates clambered up the side, brandishing their knives and cutlasses, and without doubt anxious to use them on our throats. With few exceptions, they were all on board, and the schooner sheered off, and hove too. The'ship also came up in the wind, and hal- yards and sheets seemed to fly at the same instant. The intense suspense with which we awaited the further development of our plans riveted our gaze upon the ship in breathless excitement. The iron-shod mo- Inents seem slowly to drag out an intermi- nable existence. It seemed impossible that they should not already have discovered their danger. They must have perceived and extinguished the matches. O! had we shortened their length a trifle. what a nest of demons we should have sent to theii long home! To us it was a moment - of intense excitement and anxiety. "Sutddenly wye saw them throwing them- selves into the sea, the schooner crowding all sail an.! standing off her boats adrift. At the same moment, a thick white cloud as- cended from the ship's deck-and a dense olack mass, with heavy majestic folds, arose with frowning portentous look-followed by a deafening report, filling the air with flying and falling timbers, and carrying beneath the surface of the water many of the swim- ming, struggling desperadoes. We perceive also that their craft had .lost its foremast, having probably been carried away by some  of the flying timbers;. We now breathed  again and gave vent to our pent-up feelings in three hearty cheers. Resuming our oars,  we shortly afterwards were picked up by  Captain Fishe, to whom we would, thus i publicly, acknowledge our gratitude for his 1 kind treatment while on board his ship."'  To which the Times remarks, "we trust - that his majesty's ships, now cruising in i those seas, will soon be enabled to give us an  account of the capture of these precious and c daring scoundrels, who have so long eluded the sword of justice."         Y *  *  *  *  *  *  *  Two days after the arrival at Port-Royal v of the Britannia, the Meteor let go her an- A chor at Port Antonio, on the north eastern a end ot the island of Jamaica. Roderigo n   Id immediately went on shore, and proceeded if at once to King ton, arriving there after 'o dark of the same evening. Elizabeth was w busily engaged in preparing for her de. e parture the following morning, when she - was aroused by the entrance of a servant tX !. annoulnce a gentleman below who desired te e speak with her. Upon ascertaining he was e not the same who had a short time previous  left the house, (Count Corregio,) she descend ! ed to the drawing room, and the next mo i ment was in the arms of Roderigo. "Eliza- ebeth" and "Alfonso," were the only words  uttered by either party for some moments. sAt length, Elizabeth, gently freeing. hersell t from Roderigo's embrace, said: "Aifonso! why will you thus unneces- sarily expose yourself to danger-it cannot be possible you are aware of the risk you run here? Three of his majesty's ships are tnow lying at Port Royal, and they all sail to-morrow, bent on your destruction. O Al- fonso! though you know how nluch'I prize your society, would to Heaven you were a thousand miles hence!" "My dear girl, your fears for my safety cause you to magnify the danger. Be as- sured, I incur not one half the peril you imagine. It is necessary I shoul. learn something of the plans of these commanders, and in, order to do so correctly and satisfac- torily, I must of course personally approach a little nearer them than perhaps your fears for me might deemot prudent. Having in- formed mytself with regard to their future operatiots, I can the more readily prevent surprise." "'True, Alfonso, I see you are right, and must thus frequently place not on!y your liberty but your life and my happiness in jeopardy. O! that you could leave this dangerous warfare and retire with us to some quiet, peaceful spot, On old England's shores, where we might spend the remainder of our days in the calm sunshine of undis- turbed happiness. Can I not prevail with you, Alfonso?" said she, as her eyes spark- led at the picture her imagination had con- jured up, and met his with a gaze that pene- trated the deepest recesses of his soul. "Tempt me not, angel," said Roderigo, clasping her to his heart, "I may not yet look on that bright picture. Duty-honor, at present compel me to avert my eyes from its contemplation, ere my heart waver or ry honor be tarnished. No! Elizabeth, stera necessity obliges me to forego that happiness for which my heart continually yearns, and for a while fix my thoughts on ruder scenes --but looking above, I place my confidence in HM.! feeling assured that whatever may be our destinies, He who cannot er- will order all' things aright." "( Well be it so then, I will no longer tease you with my fears, but with you will en- deavor without a murmur to trust the all- wise Power above us.  You men tioned, Alfonso, just now, your desire to be made acquainted with the intentions of the com- manders of the frigates; fortunately, I have   t: in my power t, infbrm you ot a part of their plans Lasg evening, Captain Thomp- son, of the Britarnia, took tea with us and passed the evening: and in the course of conversation, mentioned your vessel, and spoke of your daring-and of the various newspaper accounts of your exploits. A vessel is reported in one paper to have been fallen in with by you, the vesse! and cargo destroyed, but all hands belonging to her personally receiving the utmost attention, and were finally landed at a place from whence they could and did reach their homes in safety. Again, it is said, another vessel has been overhauled (by/ this same Meteor) from which, fortunately, one individual contrives to escape, and reports the ship plundered and all hands but himself cruelly butchered. Vessels are tound at sea robbed, and their murdered crew, with frightful gashes, lying in pools of blood on the decks. 'Now,' said Captain Thompson, 'this Ro- derigo must be a strange sort of fellow to be so ferocious at one time and so mild at another.' 'But,' replied my father, ,may there not be two of them?' The same idea has occurred to me,' said Captain Thomp- son, 'and, upon reflection, the track of this blood-hound seems to have been among the Leeward and Windward Islands, and west along the Spanish Main-while that of the more humane Roderigo has been upon the broad Atlantic; however, if there are two of them, they must at all events have their hiding-places somewhere about here, and, please God, we will ferret them out sooner or later. We have adopted such plans,' con- tinued he, 'as I think must place him or them in our power.' He then inforned us that the Britannia would convoy us suffi- ciently far to place us'out of danger." '"Excuse the interruption," said Roderigo, but are you about leaving again for old England?" "Yes, Alfonso, I was making the necessary preparations preparatory to our departure when you were announced, We sail to-mor- row -rorning in the ship Conrad, Captain Parker." "This is, indeed, welcome news, and may God grant youa pleasant and prosperous voy- 'age. Bud I interrupted you, Elizabeth; as this information is of the greatest importance, I trust you will excuse my impatience; besides I must be on board my vessel and put to sea to-night. Will you therefore have the kind- ness to resume?" "' The other two frigates,' continued Cap- tain Thompson," said Elizabeth, "'also sail in company with us.'" Elizabeth then pro- ceeded to unfold to Roderigo the various plans of the commanders, the seas, to be scoured, the different ports to be visited, &c., ,and finished by adding, "Not dreaming of this visit on your part, I still thought it pos- sible we might meet with you; and knowing that the movements of these vessels would be serviceable to you, I paid the strictest atten- tion to what was said, and upon our visiter's departure. retired o my loom ab d )mmitted 4*   the whole to writing, and afterwards t merne ory. I then destroyed the paper, fearing its discovery might lead to unpleasant suspi- cions." Roderigo having committed this informra- tion to paper, couched in language intellii- ble only to himself, restored the memorandum to his pocket, saying- "I thank you, Elizaoeth. for having im-. parted to me this truly invaluable informa- tion; and now I must tear myself foni you, as I have many miles to travel ere I reach my vessel. In God's keeping I leave you, with the most sincere and ardent prayers that He may ever watch ever, bless, and shield you from harm. He alone knows if we shall meet again in this world; but be assured that whether our meeting be. here or aloft, my heart shall be true to its last dying pul- sation. Once more, dearest, farewell; and may God bless you," and embracing her with the warmest and, purest affection, while her surcharged heart found utterance only in those soul-speaking eyes, which beamed upon him in tenderness and love, kindling in his soul that pure and holy fire which none but noble natures can truly feel. For a moment those impassioned glances embodied and poured forth the burning thoughts that filled their souls, and throueh them vows of endur- ing affection were interchanged, and the next --he was gone.  Retiring to her room- on bended knees, and with face buried in her hands, Elizabeth offered up her humble and devout petition to her heavenly Father that he would guide, shield, and protect them both --more particularly Alfonso. Thus with wo- man's true and self-forgetting devotion, she prayed with more fervor for the happiness of her lover than for herself. Alas! how different from such loveliness is cold, unfeeling, mammon-seeking 'man! Wrapped up in himself, and thinking only how he may increase his comforts, how un- mindful is he of the happiness of those bright flowers in life's thorny path-those gentle,' uncomplaining and never wearying promoters of his good-whose nat!ure, in contrast with his own, sinks to the level of the beasts, while woman's, heightened and rendered more lovely, rises to an angelic elevaion. Indeed, how cold' and desolate would this world ap- pear uthlest by woman's presence! 'How harsh, discordant, and grating on the ear would be the voice of man, if unsoftened by the affection which she never fails to inspire in a greater or a less degree, in the hearts ol all! If his nature is at best rough and un- couth now, surrounded as he is by these nev- er-failing incentives to refinement, elegance, and grace-deprived of them, how far would he sink below the grade of irrational animals! With what a dormant, death-like stupor would all his finer sensibilities be enshrouded unless quickened and called into action by the gentle beings who surround his path! The chamber of sickness, too, alas! how cheerless would that be rendered ungraced by woman. A mother's, sister's love, and un- tiring;solicitude, ah! what a countless crowd     of th ughts Jill the mind and knock at the heart at the mention of these! How quickly imagination plumes its wings, and, with ra- pil flight. carries us back to the halcyon days of childhood, hovering over the flowery spots that marked our infant hours, till compelled reluctantly and with weary pinions to retrace its flight and survey the contrast! When, too, the clouds of adversity and sorrow lower up- on us, what balm so soothing, what so cheer- ing as the words that flow from woman's lips? And should poverty overtake us, who I is so ready as self-sacrificing woman to sup- port its cold and chilling influences? True it is there are exceptions, and strange would it be were it not so-strange that on the surface of life's troubled ocean no wretch should appear. But beware! oh, man, how you point at these with the finger of unfeel- ing scorn ere you trace back their histories to the time when life's-warm current flowed with innocent and buoyant gaiet!y through their youthful veins-when " hope told a flat- tering tale". to their confiding hearts-ere the gay and soulless deceiver breathed his poi- i sonous breath upon the budding flower--ere l unrequited love, blasted hopes, or the enven- / omed tongue had crushed the guileless heart, filling it with the gall of bitterness.--ere in- c gratitude had shot its poisoned barb into the soul-ere the unkind look and angry word with icy chill had fallen upon the warm, de- voted heart, freezing its gushing fountains i and blasting its every joy-ere man,in fact, d with assiduous and persevering art, had won tl the pri'eless jewel and crushed it beneath his t feet.

Elizabeth, re 'lsing from her bended knees, with resigned ( u and even. cheerful feelings, once more re- fist sumed her task of preparation for their de- tan parture. Count Montmorency was absent ant mn Roderigo's entrance, and did not return bar until after his departure. Corregio-cr, as ter, we shall call him by his real name, Herxaa- out   the dez-after lingering in .own till nea mori rly ing, returned with all convenient haste to ,a- the lugger, (not, howevet without informinR y s himself of the intended movements of the )ts cruisers,) and, putting to sea, stood directly ed for Cuba, where he arrived alongside the ce schooner early the same day. Leaving the to, lugger at anchor, as previously agreed on, p- the schooner immediately weighed and stood r- out of the harbor; and passing through the 's Windward Passage, .clearing the numerous o I islands, reefs and keys, she took a course due p- north. Roderigo having obtained all the information which had induced him at this ge time to visit the island, directly on leaving n Count Montmorency's residence,. remounted h his mule, and, travelling with all. dispatch, w inr due time trod the quarter-deck of the 1- Meteor. The active crew were not long in s weighing anchor, making sail, and also d standing out the Windward Passage, but h without encountering Hernandez's vessel; - where, taking Crooked Island Passage, they e stood off to the north-nlorth-west. Continu- - ing her course for several days, and allowing e the Britannia time to have parted wilth the - Conrad, and to have visited those islands in ,the immediate vicinity to the north and west of St. Domingo, and to continue on her e course toward Porto Rico, the Meteor retraced i her flight, and put back for her rendezvous among the Caycos. Roderigo was well sat- s isfied that the neighborhood would not be , disturbed by the presence of any cruisers for three weeks at least-and leaving him here to put his Vessel in the most thorough condi- tion for offence and defence, supp;ied from a subterranean magazine of nautical and warlike resources, which he had there es- tablished, We will again revisit Jamaica and see what is going on at Port Royal; At nine o'clock, on a bright sunny morn- ing, early in July, a gun was fired fromh the Britannia, and at the same moment the signal for the fleet to get underweigh was run up to her fore-royal-mast-head. Before the rever- berating echoes of the report had died away in the distance, the shrill whistle of the boat- swain fell on the ear, and then the .harp} clear notes of the fife were heard, ao ,mpa- nied by th, heavy and regular tramp jf the several crews, bringing home the anchors.- Again thre shrill whistle, and the nimble tars thickly stud the shrouds and lay out on the yards. With simultaneous "'let fall," the heavy canvas hangs in graceful folds from the ponderous yards. Again the descending crew once more tread the deck, while the tc-. men overhaul reef-tackles, buntlines, and clewlines; while those on deck sheet home and make all fast: again is heard the merry tramp .of the active seamen and 'with magic regularity the yards rise aloft; the anchor, "uptorn from its oozy cave," is w"eighed and fished, and head-sails trimn -ou, ti, the Bri- tann:ia fills away, followed by lbe m'c. .; igates and the Conrad, (on board lhe llae, t e era barked Count Montmore icy a;n ti. tdaugh- ter, and the rich De Catnro,) ann all stand out the harbor A&'.er ra bind wmp^ruy witr   the Fredonia-the Britannia and Isabella, with the Conrad in company, made the best zf their way out the Windward Passage. Doubling Cape Maeze, the Isabella stood ,More westerly, while the ]Britannia and Con- rad taking the' Mayaguana Passage worked to about one decree N. E. of Watling's Island. Here, i iterchianging good wishes they parted company-the Britannia to pro- secute her search to the South and East, and the Conrad for old England. Leaving all parties to pursue their respective courses, (with what success will be seen in the se- lqueD we will 'at once transport the reader to England's happy-shores. Let us then from -the tall and whited cliffs of Dover, behold yon gallant ship! with what a proud and noble bearing does she spurn aside the briny waters, as wi!h flowing can- vas and favoring breeze she makes her way up the Channel. Look! e'en now she is al- most beneath our feet: she comes up into the wind, her main-topsail to the mast: a signal is-run up to her fore-royal-mast-head, and a boat is making for her. Perhaps some long- absent son is about to tread again the land 3f his nativity, while his heart beats with anxious solicitude to know, yet dreading to ask, the fate of many a loved one left behind -a kind and deeply revered mother-a vene- rable and honored father--sisters and broth- ers with whom he had garnbolled in the gala days of childhood, all freshy brought to mind as though parted from but yesterday. See yonder group of blooming females and two noble-looking men, whose youthful, man- ly, and cheerful countenances indicates not more than thirty summers! One of them carries in his hand a spy-glass--and now,that the boat has reached the'ship he raises it to his eye, while a gentleman in military cos- tume, with a lovely child, is seen to descend the side and the boat puts off With them for the shore, while the ship attain fills away and continues her course up Channel. Note the anxious look depicted on the countenances Of his companions as they crowd around him. and with silent watchful gaze, seek to read in his face a confirmat on of their hopes as with the distance-dispelling tube he seeks for some familiar form! Now the warm blood recedes from the cheek, as they observe a shade of gloom flit over their companions features, when, on the officer's hat. he percelves the sadly speaking crape. Slowly he removes the glass and with a half- suppressed sigh, replies to their inquiring looks, "It is he." "But Maria?" faintly asks one of the ladies. "She is nft there," replies her friend. With heart-sickening forebodings and anxious haste, they now wend their way to the landing. Let us fol- low them. They anxiously await the arri- val f the boat--it touches the shore, and from it the officer and child land, with the starting tear in his manly eye, he silently ex- tends his hand; but dares not trust his voice. A moment-and the two sister, Helen and Henrietta are fast locked in the arms of their brother, Capt. Fitz Albert.   The poor child, whose tiny heart is ever open to sympathe tic joy or sorrow, with streaming eyes and upturned look, seeks his father's face, as he grasps his knees, and, with child-like accents, inquires, "What's the matter, papa?" Disengaging herself from her brother's arms, Henrietta seizes the child, and, with tearful eye and thrilling hear, presses him to her bosom. The little fellow, loving all he sees his father love clasps her neck with his chubby arms, anti bedews. it with his infantile tears. Hardy and Cassel now approached Fitz-Albert, and With firm grasp, indicative of the warmth of their hearts, seize his proffered hands, while they struggle in vain to repress the rising tear. Silently and sadly they now seek the paternal home, where, seated in the quiet parlor, with two beautiful little girls, (the children of Helen and Henrietta,) are the venerable and silver-headed father, and the beloved and aged mother. Let us follow the group who are now about entering the mansion. No! no! the sacred hearth at such a moment may not be pressed by the stranger's foot-we will not invade their domestic sanctuary now, but re- tire till that revered couple have embraced their long ahsent, deeply loved and only son, and heard from his own lips the sad fate of their beloved Maria.---- Captain Fitz- Albert had now been at home several days, when his father, perceiving that grief still preyed heavily upon him, and wishing to divert his attention, said to him one morning as they sat at breakfast- "George, you undoubtedly remember the confession of Commodore --- which was left with Mr. Cassel. He and Hardy have visited London to arrange that affair, and but a short time since, I received a line from my attorney, stating that, upon representa- tion of the facts to the king, a full pardon has been granted Mr. Wallace, and his property restored. It is therefore proper that you, as the only surviving heir, should immediately visit London, and take posses- sion. I say, you being the only heir, be- cause the death in Italy of Mr. Wallace was announced some six months since-- and as my two boys here (turning to Casse. and Hardy) have thought of visiting Lon- don to-morrow, you had better accompany them." Accordingly, at an early hour on the fol- lowing morning, the party set off' in th family carriage. Arriving in town, they called On Mr. Vellum, the attorney, and all things bhing duly arranged, Fitz-Albert took possession of the property, constituted Mr. Vellum his attorney, and empowered him fullyv o manage the estate. $ Not many days after their return, Fitz-Albert was induced, at the urgent request of his father, (who felt that the infirmities of age were stealing upon him,) to resign his' commission and make his father's house his permanent abode. This he did the more willingly, as every spot around him was deeply associated with the memory of his beloved ani lost     Mai a. Here, in company with his lovely child, would he revisit those spots haiiowea oy its associations with his adored Maria, and as he pursued some favorite walk of hers, or entered some shady grove where in by-gone days'they had pa sed so many happy hours-each blade of g:ass, each flower in "s path, would seem to whisper to his heart  the name of the dear departed, and fill his soul with emotions too agonizing for endu- rance. "Oh God!" he would cry in his agony, as some one object in his walk more vividly than others, hrought her image fresh- ly before him, " why, oh why in thy mercy didst thou not permit me to share the fate of her whose loss has filled my heart with such withering loneliness. Spare, oh spare me, this soul-crushing affliction. Take me to thyself, that my riven heart may escape the desolating anguish which continually prevs upon it." But as his gaze fell upon the face of his child, and saw the image of its mother reflected there, he ould convulsively press  the child to his aching heart, and thank God that he was notrutterly alone, while gushing tears tranquilized his mind, and soothed his troubled soul. But, reader, we forbear- there is a sorrow with which a "stranger  intermeddleth not"-a grief which language s cannot express, or human sympathy avail.  *  *  *  *  *  S  * It may be well to introduce here a letter received by Roderigo, during his last visit to Kingston. He was just entering the town, a when he was accosted by a rough looking t sailor, who said,            a "If so be your honor happens to fall in b with one answering to the hail of Roderigo, I mayhap you'd be willing to oblige a poor so sailor by handing him this ere bit of a yarn,  which may be of sarvice to all consarned." B Roderigo, taking the proffered letter, and w glancing at the superscription, perceived, c after some difficulty, that it was directed "To Capt. Roderigo, of the Schr. Meteor," d he thrust the paper in his pocket. "But, my good fellow, where -- " but the sailor n had disappeared. Thinking no more of the t matter, he did not refer to the paper till some to time after, when recollecting it, he was m prompted by a natural curiosity to inspect bl its contents. Breaking the seal, it read w thus:-  'Captain-it may be your honor remem- hi bers a long sparred craft cruising about the th neighborhood of Count Iontmorency's an- le chorage some time ago, who answered to the th hail of Count Correje-ho; (a blacker-hear- re ed villain never swung in hammock,) his m colors iere false, and his true hail is Her- w nandez. He commands a quick-heeled, clean- sh run, and sharp-hulled craft of a schooner, d about one hundred and twenty ton. Her on spars are long, tapering, and rakish, and at m her fore-rial-mast-head she always carries a w red flag, and at her main a black ball. Look Bi out for him-he has sworn revenge against ea you and will have it if he can get it. Take ef the advice of one who would scorn to oeach t w Af his commander, were not that command- lia   y 1 er a base. cowardly, falst heaned vilIaia, a Should you fall in with us anytime arter a L, fortnight, from this, arm to the teeth, and f board us, and you will probably be repaid for n your trouble. We have a crew of about se- y venty men; fifty on us have determined to ni have revenge on our captain, but we shal t wait till arter you board us. :s  "Yours, at your sarvice, BILL." After reading the document Roderigo :e- mained for sometime lost in thought; then, e turning to Roberto who was standing near - him on the quarter-deck, handed him the rletter, and requested his opinion of its con. F tents. Roberto carefully perused it, and, af- ter a few moment's reflection, returned it, re- marking,   I think, as I have always thought since you first mentioned this Corregio-that he is no other than that scoundrel who has so long been prowling about these seas, committing the most cruel murders, and contriving to cast the stigma on us. With regard to the writer, I imagine that he and his comrades, for some pique against their Captain, have determined to surrender him, and for that purpose wish our aid, thinking, perhaps, thai we are of the same diabolical trade as them- selves. But how, Roderigo, could this man know of your acquaintance with his Captain, and his designs upon you?" "That is what puzzles me most. Corre- gio always came to Count Montmorency's alone, and I never remember seeing him in the street with any one. That Corregio-or as it appears, Hernanctd^--has the most un- bounded hatred for me, I entertain not the least doubt; but surely he cannot have been so indiscreet as to have revealed his plans to his crew. It is evident, however, that this Bill has from some source become acquainted with ihe intentions of his commander con- cerning me." "Perhaps," suggested Roberto, "some damsel-" ' I have it;" interrupted Roderigo,. "I now remember that at some of my visits at the Count's, while Hernandez was in Kings- ton, I occasionally saw about the premises a man in the garb of a sailor, strangely resem- bling him who gave me this letter, conversing with Ellen, Miss Montmorency's maid-and upon my bantering her on one occasion about him, she told me that he was her lover and that she had been trying to persuade him to leave his present vessel and join mine; but that her efforts had been in vain; he always replying to her entreaties that he could be ol more service to me where he was. How this was to be, she promised to reveal before I should sail-but the poor girl was taken down with the fever and died. I visited her once or twice during her sickness, and re- member seeing there this same person. We were both present when she died--this same Bill holding one of her hands. She looked earnestly at both of us, and made se eral in- effectual efforts to sneak. As soon as she was dead. Bill seized Miiss Montmorencv s hand and mine with a warm grip, while the   big tear coursed down his weathei-beaten heek, and saying God bless your honors- Bill Oakum will discharge this debt, afore he dies,' an t hastily left the room, I did not see him again till he handed me this letter, and then did not recognize him. Well! we will take his advice, and watch this devil Hernandez." Roderigo was right in his conjecture that the letter emanated from Bill Oakum. Bill, it seems, had during some of his cruises on shoreat Kingston (on Hernandez first visit to that place,) fallen in with and become strongly attached to Ellen, a very pretty bru- nette, then living in Count Montmorency's household, as before .stated. The friendly feelings of Oakum were reciprocated-for he, barring his trade,'(of which Ellen was igno- rant,) was as fine a felloweas ever rode the mountain billow. Ellen herself was 3 shrewd, intelligent, and observingr girl; and of course was not unmindful of the affection existing in the heart 6f her mistress for Rodetigo; to whom, inconsequrence of his unithrmn kindness to her, she had become attached. While at the same time, she did not fail to notice the re- pugnance with which ]Jernandez's visits in- spired Elizabeth. 'She had closely scrutini- zed the sometimes fearfully harsh counte- nance of this same Hernandez, and one even- ing when he was leaving the house, she had noiselessly and unobserved followed him to his quarters. It was at this time that Hernandez, in the wildness of his ungovernable temper, and forgetting his usual caution, gave utterance aloud to his thoughts, and exposed his whole plans to Ellen, at least so much of them as concerned her mistress and Roderigo. As she was on the point of turning homeward, Hernandez muttered, "As for the cursed scoundrels that compose my crew, I'll see that the halter puts them beyond the power of using their d-d knives on me." Ellen had insisted on Oakum's remaining till her return; and upon whice she made him ac- quainted with the kind intentions of his commander. Bill, although knowing him to be a consummate scou ndrel, was not prepared co believe him capable of such treachery; and was, 'consequently, thunder-struck at the information. For a few moments he remained silent; the heaving of his iron-knit frame, and clenched fist, tightly compressed but quiver- ing lips, and flashing eyes, all betokened the emotion that was raging within. At length rising and taking Ellen's hand, he exclaim- ed, "this shall not be--by the God tha. made me, this shall not be;" and assuming an air of levity which ill accorded with the deadly spirit of revenge which filled his bosom, he continued-"I must look after that craft, and o;, my diamond, good. night"-then giving her a kiss which made her cheeks tingle, he disappeared. That same night the poor girl was seized with the fever which carried her off, before she could make her mistress ac-  aainted with the deep villainy Hernandez   i had in contemplation. Oakum, as we harv - seen, was with her when she died, and was - witness to the many acts of kindness extend- ted to her by Elizabeth and Roderigo. Notwithstanding the lawless life he led, - Oakum had naturally a kind and generous I heart. In early youth none possessed a more noble one-but unjustly suffering an t ignominious punishment for the crime of , another,-he had borne it in silence; and ' with a broken spirit aindcrushed feeiings was cast from his prison on the world. His for- i mer friends shunned him, for all believed in - his guilt. Even the cold-blooded scoundrel ; who had destroyed his fair namef orever, avoided him, but from a different reason; he , justly feared to meet the revenge which his own conscience told him he so richly merited. : Oakum's long and unjust confinement had changed his nature. Instead of the mild and , generous-hearted fellow he had been before t the cruel burden of this stain, he was reck- less and unforgiving; determined to hunt,. the earth for the villain who had thus basely wronged him, have his revenge, and then, seeking the decks of some freebooter, declare war against all mankind. He was not long in finding his enemy-and meeting him one night in a lonely, unfrequented spot, Oakum took from his pocket a brace of loaded pistols and handing him one of them, "cowardly scoundrel," said he, "I am willing to be- lieve that at least one faint spark of honot may still .struggle for existence in youl worthless heart-take this, step off ten paces and at the word 'three' fire! and may God have mercy on your rotten soul!" The mis- erable wretch seeing the savage determina- tion of Oakum's eye attempted to conciliate his by saying, "Come, Bill, let's be friends again-I'd no idea of carry the joke so far." "Joke!" almost roared Oakum, "joke! you contemptible wretch, fly, fly to your post. or by the Gods I fear I shall murder you or the Spot." Sinking on his knees, the abject wretch implored him to forgive and not murder him "know, Bill," continued he, "you have too generous a heart to murder me with all my sins unatoned for." "You appeal in vain, you miserable cringing puppy-I have no longer that gene- rous heart--your infernal,villanv naa turn- ed it to stone. Jump," said he, applying his foot to the prostrate body of the grovelling being, " will you lay there like a dog and re ceive this ball in your brain, or stand up and with at least the outwarc. show :f a man. take your chance of finishing your work or meeting your reward!" Thrusting the pis- tol into his hand and with a single jerk lift- ing his trembling victim to his feet he bade him step off ten paces, wheel; and fire at the word. Seeing no chance of escape, he pre tended to do as he was commanded: bu, proved a dastardly villain to the last; th( having measured off but five paces he wheel ed, and with a frightened and unsteady ain fired without injuring his opponent--ties     wildly throwing his pistol at the head of his injured friend, attempted to escape. Oakum raised his pistol and fired, the leaden messen- ger of death sped its way, and the man who had so deeply wronged him lay on the earth a lifeless, bleeding corpse. After this tragical event, Oakum repaired to the West Indies, and meeting with Her- nandez at one of the Islands. was easily per- suaded to join his vessel. Here his bold and tearless daring soon gave him an ascendency over the crew-but his acquaintance with Ellen, whom he deeply loved, had been peel- ing off by piecemeal the flinty casing that bad grown over his heart, exposing here and ,nere spots from which emanated the kind and generous impulses of former days. But oow, that his idol was dead, he was Ithrown lack upon himself without a friend on earth. No!" exclaimed he, as he was reflecting pon his loss, "I am not friendless-that sweet angel and the noble Roderigo, have, by their kindness to my Ellen, befriended me; and for their sakes I will live. thwart and punish their enemy, and that too, when his blackened soul gloats on its revenge and deems its plans about to be fully accomplish- ed." Meanwhile let us return to Hernandez, who had been cruising about six weeks without meeting his preyv which galled him exceed- ingly-for he doubted not that they must have passed him in the night, though he was determined to seek theni even to the English ehannel; and accordingly continued his eruise. In the meantime Oakum had in- formed those of his companions in whom he felt he could trust, of all that Ellen had dis- covered concernirng Hernandez' plans--but he had the greatest difficulty, nothwithstand- ing their oath offealty to him, in restraining them from immediate acts of violence. He did, however, succeed, and they checked their revenge, much as the chained tiger curbs his native ferocity, till some fitting opportunity presents itself for its unrestrained indulgence. They had, however, mutually agreed that Oakum should be leader in the execution of their plars, that they would quietly await'the signal to be given by him, and so deport \ themselves as to avoid the least suspicion of E insubordination; and so effectually did they a carry out their resolution as entirely to banish from the minds of Hernadez and Pe- 1 dro, and even that blood-hound Diablo, all  idea of their dissatisfaction. This favorable change in the minds of the crew, was at- 1 tributed by these three worthies to a recent A liberal allowance of grog, and the distribution c among them   of three thousand dollars in ] specie by Hernandez, who said he had just c discovered a mistake in the division of their r last prize money; he, well knowing they S could not spend it while at sea, and intend- t inag they should never again have an oppor- p tunity in port. Notwithstanding the pro- c found satisfaction which the altered de t- meanour of his crew afforded him, still Her-  aandez could not entirely keep down the h tstural. ferocity of his temper, lashed, as j i   is was into continual warfare within him-by m his disappointment in not yet meeting the - object of his search-and as he occasionally Oo gave utterance in words to the angry temiest h that raged within, the strong breasts of the seamen composing Oakum's party would d heave with mighty and fearful indications as - the pent up hurricane of wrath strove for' e- - cape-like the confined and struggling volca- d no in its mighty efforts to free itself from y thraldom, heaving and tossing the superin- h cumbent earth in wild and terror-striking 1- commotion, warning the beholder to beware it of its fast approaching and terrible outhreak. d But the master spirit of Oakum, who knew d from his own experience what it was to keep t in subjection the storm that raged in the n breasts of his shipmates, carefully and firmly  held them at bay. One beautiful day when g the winds f heaven came to them over the t waters in gentle cooling zephyrs, slightly' y rippling t e surface of the ocean with their ; breath, an fanning away the burning heat i which  ured down upon them  from the s bri t and cloudless ,un-the crew were re- d cli ing on and about the fore-top-gallant - dece    which an awning was spread,) chafed and cross, for they had been more ) than usually annoyed that morning by Her- i' nandez' fretfulness. Oakum, who saw the - black and fast gathering scowls on the coun- t tenances of the most impatient of his party raised his can to his lips, (for they had just been served out with their " grog,") and tak- ing a pretty generous portion, said, "Come, -messmates, what's the use of lying here like e cattle, chawing our cuds in silence? What say you, my boys, for a bit of a yarn? I moves-as them ere shore-going chaps say when they get up in town meeting, but keep standing in the same place as quiet asa frigate's best bower at the bottom of seventy fathom. I moves that Bob Lanyard give us a bit of a yarn consarning that cruise of. his'n, when he went a courting that ere gal who answered to the hail of the May Flower. 'Come, lads, here's a bumper to the little tight-rigged May Flower! and the ' May Flower" guggled in the throats of the sea. men, as the words struggled for escape, in the sea of grog that sought its way down the same passage. "Well, messmates," said Lanyard, giving his waisthands a hoist and supplying his mouth with a fresh quid," if so be you're a mind to have a yarn consarning the saucy little May Flower, I'll try to 'commodate you. You see I'd just come into the port of Lon- don, arter a cruise of three years in the old Betty Flounder, and arter having been paid off; newly fitted and ballasted, -I made up my mind for a cruise of observation on shore. So trimming my sails'with a steady hand at the helm, (for that ere Lonnon's a cursed ba4 place to navigate, such a fleet of small craft continually twart and going ahead as though the devil himself had the helm,) well, as I was saying with a watchful hand at the [:elm, I pt: away before the wind, and stood along ander easy sail down Thames   Street. Nothing particular occurred till I made ocal exchange light: you know, Bill, where that is?" "Aye, aye, just a beam of Billingsgate," said Bill. "Yes-well, local exchange light was distant maybe about pistol shot on my starboard bow, when a strange sail shot out of port in the neighborhood, with streamers and pennants flying alow and aloft and un- der a press of sail stood on the same course as I, looming up like a Dutch man-o'-war on the outer edge of a fog-bank. 'Damn my eyes, Bob,' says I, aint she a beauty? Such a taut-rig-such beautiful spars, and such a hull, too. Why, Bob Lanyard, says I, you're a fool, an' you don't board that ere craft. So clapping on all canvas, I made sail for her at the rate of ten knots; but she- was' a screamer for sailing, and such a navigator, I'm blessed if I ever seed afore! Why, lord bless you, she made nothing of dashing in among them ere small craft while under full headway, as if she had a plenty of sea room- some o' ern at anchor--some on the wind, ,ome before the wind, and some o' em drift- nng along with the tide, and all as thick as mosquitoes at the funeral" of a messmate. An' 'then it would have done your eyes good to see how charmingly she managed the helm-now luffing-now  falling off-, now wearing, and now tacking, as some lubberly fellow run his craft athwart her fore foot, or threatened to run afoul herbow-or she lashed blearing all on 'em, and not losing a spar. Now, messmates, you know very well that Bob Lanyard is no fool at the helm, but l curse me if I could sheer clear of all o' em, and now and then, bang I'd come down on some of the small fry, and striking them amidships in the eyes, or the quarter, or starn, run 'em under iri no time-for you see I was high out o' water, being only in good ballast trim. "Howsoever, twar'nt long afore the frigate began to take in sail, having observed me in chase, I spose, for I seed her occasionally take a look astarn; and every time she did Oo, may I be keel-hauled if I war'nt so blind- ed, that not seeing anything in the way, slam I'd go right afoul of some lubberly fellow, and of course, you see, under he's go, and over I'd go. Arter a while (specially when she'd re- duced her saiD I began to overhaul her fast: coming up and shooting some distance ahead a' her, I boxed the compass round her, taking a good survey of her hull, rigging and spars, low and aloft, and ranged long side under her  harbor beam. Reducing sail so as not to a range ahead, I hailed her. 'Homeward 1 bound, my jewel?' says I. 'That depends b bupon sarcu nstances,' says she, in a voice that 1 ounded as though it came from a silver mine, while at the same time she let fall on  me her two large, bright glimmers, with such r a flood of light, that I'm blest if I warn'nt as ' blind as a bat for a rinit, and rolled and  thumped along side on her like a Dutch gal- liot in a heavy sea. ' Dowse your glimmers, p says I, 'my pretty bird, :cause you see they n blind me s), I can't keen my corrse, and I'll c   [ t b after running afoul.' So, with a rmilitg ,I face as bright as the moon arter taking a i bath, she said she would look tother way i then. 'What's your hail, my diamond ' t ' May Flower, at your sarvice,' said she. 'Well, y my pretty May Flower, what says you for a t cruise?' says I. 'That depends upon the s whereabouts, the length of the cruise, and the - fitting out.' e    "Now you see, messmates, I didn't kere to be boxing the compass without coming to the pint, for you must know that as soon as she hove in sight I was determined on hav- I ing her, so says I, My little charming May a Flower, what say you for a cruise to the par- ) sons and sailing in company for life? I've, as you see, (showing her a manifest of my cargo,) a snug fit out for two, and I'm blest if yoe shall ever want for anything while Bob Lanyard has a shot in the locker.' Well, de' yer see, at that down came them ere glimmers again on me, as sparkling as a * whole mine of diamonds, and the conse quence was that I sheered off and went pell mell right aboard a bandy-legged lubber, and run him under. Clearing myself from the wreck, I shot alongside the May Flower, who was laying with her main-top-sails to the mast, waiting for me to come up. Filling away again, we continued in company. I'm afraid, Bob,' says she, I we'll hardly do to sail in company, seeing I cause you to steer so wild.' Never you mind that, my pink,' says I, 'the eagle has to become used to the dazzling brightness of the sun 'fore he can fix his gaze upon it-so if you're a mind to sign the articles, just tip us'your flipper, and we'll 'bout ship for the parson,' and, without any more palaver, she gave me her flipper and struck her fla--so we tacked ship and stood for the parson's anchorage. Arrived there, the old fellow says & Well Jack, what do you want?' ISpliced, your honor,' said I, tipping him a crown. Stewing away the money, he tied the knot hard and fast, and the last time I seed her, two year gone, she had a brace of as pretty Lanyards as ever you seed." CHAPTER XX. "Sail ho!" resounded from the fore-top- gallant-mast-head. 'i Where away?" cried Hernandez, as he sprang to his feet from a recumbent position against the taffrail u Where away?" cried he, with an earnestness and sharFness that brought many of the prostrate listeners of Bob's story to their feet. "Dead astern, sir," replied the lookout, "and he's coming down on us with all his rags set and seems to have a pocket full of wind, for he carries a bone in his mouth half as large as ourcraft." "Anothet of these cursed cruisers, I supt poses-why in h-I can't they let me atone now that Ians endeavoring to break up my crtisings," savagely muttered he, as with     the glass at his eye he discovered the stran- ger comnlin down on him with great rapidlity. "Pedro, clap on stun'-sails low and aloft, and set everything you can crowd on her, for -Avast, hold on, Pedro-by God! it is her-luff, sir: why don't you luff, you lub- ber?" said the excited, half-demented Her- nandez to the helmsman, "What are you about there, damn you, fore-ard, that you don't naul aft the sheets? Damn my eyes, you're all aback"-as the schooner came up in the wind, which. was now fresh, and main- sail, fore-sail, stay-sail, gib and flying gib were slatting about with tumultuous disor- der, while Hernandez was stamping and rav- ing on the quarter-deck, as he pointed aloft I to the fore and main-top-sails aback. In a few moments, however, everything was again snug, and the schooner close hauled on the wind, shot through the water and worked her way uts to-windward. The stranger, not seeming to like this manceuvre, changed her course and endeavored toescape her suspici- ous neighbor by also working to windward. In this there seemed some little prospect of success, for they were some five orsix leagues apart; and although Hernandez had the ad- vantage in ptfnt of rig, the stranger had the advantage of' the weather-gauge-besides, if the wind freshened, which it appeared dis- posed to do, or even continued as it then blew they would stand a better chance of escaping I than the schooner would of overhauling them.  Hernandez, who seemed to fear this, notwith-  standin- Pedro's remonstrances, ordered all sail to be set that would draw, and the schoon-  er, covered with' a cloud of canvas, labored e and plunged on the sea, covering her decks  with water and spray-the heavy pressure  above retarding, instead of accelerating her c speed.                  t Leaving the two vessels to make the best use of the nautical skill of their seve- t 'al officers, combined with their own. sail- t ing qualities, we beg the favor of our readers' t Company while we repair on board the a Conrad, and join the society of our hero- e ine and her father. Ever since the Britan- u cia had parted company, the Conrad had 1 been baffled by head winds or calms, and in g consequence,. though now more than six 1 weeks out of port, she had made' but very lit- u tle headway. On the morning, however, of which we speak, she had for the first time y since leaving Kingston, a fresh, fair wind, th and Capt. Parker being unwilling to lose a A particle of its favorable influences, displayed q all the sail he could muster, while the ship, a as if participating in the general joy felt on yc -board at the favorable change, dashed gaily li along, illing her wake with foam and whirl- ing, bubbling eddies. It was now   nine w o'clock in the morning, and Elizabeth, (who y. had seen enough of sea-life not to be annoyed by that most uncomfortab!e companion, sea- w sickness.)' in company with her father, Capt.  Parker and De Castro, ascended the quarter- A deck with those gentlemen to breathe again, hi :he fresh air. and in common with all abroad he to have her heart made made glad by the be- I   n- nign and choe ing effect of a fair and ft wti ty. breeze, after to long a time spent ii. op o. nd ing winds-and what was more difficult to eor endure, dull, monotonous calms; accom- is panied by that blues-engendering, ennui-feed- b- ing, music, the creaking, moaning sound !r- emitted by the bows swinging to and fro, as )u the ship with sluggish reel staggered on the )u glassy surface of the irregular-heaving is, slothful sea. Ah! 'tis then more than when ip storms are careering, that the thoughts oi n- the mariner fly homeward. All that sur- ib rounds him offerling no resting-place for the r- mind, imagination wings its way to the r- happy home of childhood, and would fain ft convert the dull, cheerless moanings of the a creaking booms into the merry peal of laugh- n ter-loving prattlers, or the sweet and affea e tionate tones of more advanced, but equally Tr dear friends. How often have we at sucfh tt times, in utter abandonment to the lazy influ- r ences by which we were surrounded, looked -,aloft and watched the many varied forms 1. and- fantastic curves which the heavy sleepy- f looking, empty sails would present on their s surfaces, as now and then some catspaw -would distend a corner, and with playful, flitting course, puff out the canvas in seem- f ing wish to cheat' it with the hope of a - coming breeze-or raising the eye to heaven'r , blue vault, and fixing the gaze on some vapor- like cloQud, traced out in its ever varying changes, the gallant ship with press of sail- the noble charger-' the proud chariot-or the faint outlines of hill and dale, tree and shrub, with which the homestead is surround- [ed; or did the noisy booms interrupt this train of reflection, how often have we fancied in those moanings the voices of the spirits of the air, and- strove to cait(h the thread of their discourse. Eli2abeth, taking the arm of her fathe, promenaded the deck; the prosperous breeze taking all sorts of liberties with her flowing tresses, while at the same time it cheered and animated her heart with the hope that ere it left them their eyes might be blessed with the Sicht of England's chalky cliffs. The conversation gradually turned on the gentleman and his child, who had been fel- low-passengers with them on their recent re. urn to Jamaica. "By the way, dear father, I have never yet had the opportunity of relating to you the history of that gentleman-Capt. Fitz- Albert-with which he was so kind as to ac. quaint me, together with that of his wife and which I have been so long promising you. If you are now at leiure and would like to hear it, I will repeat his narrative." "Certainly, my dear daughter, I am al- ways ready and pleased to hear anything you have to communicate." Elizabeth then related the -tory with which our readers have already Deen made acquainted-l-but while speaking of Lady Mary Wallace, Malia, Commodore   and his villany towards her brother in the navy, her father suddenly interrupted her. "Was that /er brother that Commodore   -.---- so shamefully trea;ed?" said he, with much earnestness. "Yes," answered Elizabeth, " but why do you ask with so much solicitude, my dear fa- ther, were you acquainted with that unfortu- nate young man?" (for her father had not yet made known to -her that part of Roderi- go's history which, the reader will remem- ber, had been communicated to Count Mont- morency by Roderigo himself). , ' Alas!' said the Count, with a sigh and speaking more to his, own heart than in re- ply to his daughter -"It is the same-be- lieving her dead, she once more appears al- most within his grasp only to sink from his sight forever! Her husband and child-his nephew so long with him, and yet finally to pass unknown!" "Dear father-what do you say? is it pos- sible that that lovely child was the nephew and that amiable woman the sister of Alf- Boderigo?" said Elizabeth, while her heart throbbed as though it would escape its pri- son-ho'se--".Ah! then it was no idle fancy of mine when I traced in that beautiful child's face, the noble features of his"-un- cle, she would have said, bitt the fond paren- tal smile on her father's face covered her own with blushes, as she recollected she was giv- ing utterance to the secret motive which bound her heart so closely to the boy. She was silent for a few moments and then added, "How unfortunate that we did not know this when on board the Meteor-we should then have had two weighty arguments to in- duce Roderigo to quit his 'present mode of life." "Yes, my child, it seems to us uafortunate, but so it is sometimes willed by an overrul- ing Providence, and it becomes us to bow with submission to those dispensations of which, although at the time we cannot see the justness, yet eventually prove for our good. God grant that this may all come out as we wish!" "Amen!" responded the heart of Eliza- beth, who after a few moments silence, con- cluded her narrative. At this instant their attention was drawn to the' the foretop, wheie, with the glass at his eye, was Capt. Parker intently looking -at sone object far down in the distant hori- ron, dead to leeward. "What do you see, Capt. Parker?" said the Count, as the Capt. was hastily descend- ing the rigging. "Oh! it's a small rakish-looking craft whose manoeuvres I do not altogether admire, -aid he, hjs he joined them and at the same Aime ordered the ship to be jammed close on the wind. While this was doing he handed the Count the glass and requested his opin- ion of the stranger, remarking that he believ- ed he (Count AI.) had once fallen in with the Meteor, and expressing some fears that this stranger migh be th same. Count Mont- rmorency, as soon as he gained a good view, saw at a glance that it was a craft much smaller. "That is not the Meteor," said he "but   a craft whose acquaintance I shol d not care o make: she seems to be working this way sil'r. "Yes, sir"-replied Capt. Parkel, "she has changed her course within a few min- ttes. She was running before the wind when Ijrlst discovered her, but now she seems bent on speaking with us, though she'll have to work sharp to do it; if'this fine breeze con- tinues, we will give him a pull till night comes on and then dodge him in the dark." It was now about noon and the good ship ()nrad was ploughing her Way through the waters at a rapid rate. The wind had-fresh- ened but the ship had a clean run and rather a full bow and buried herself less in the seas than had she been sharper built. The schoon- er, overburthened with canvas, labored, as we have shown, so much that the Conrad was fast increasing the distance between them. -In the meantime Capt. Parker's offi- cers, passengers, and crew were busily en- gaged in getting ready for immediate use sundry muskets, pistols, cutlasses, and two six-pound cannon with which the ship was provided. The ship's company numbered twenty-four stout, able-bodied men; the two gentlemen passengers and Elizabeth, mal/ing twenty-seven all told. Among the cargo were several cases of cutlasses and ship pis- tols; these were got out and put in order for use, there being plenty of powder and ball on board. Every man armed himself with pis- tols and cutlass, was determined to fight to the last moment-even Elizabeth had armed herself resolved, should occasion require, to use her weapons while she had power. We have omitted a very important personage on board (which swells the number to twenty- eight) viz--Murphy O'Brien, an Irish ser- vantof De Castro. He was a tall, stout, heavy- built fellow, as lively as an eel, and as fond of fight as a duck is of water. Seizing his cutlass, which'he had been sharpening, he flourished it over his head, as he capered about the decks, exclaiming: "By my sowl, an them divils would be af- ter a bit of a fight, here's the boy that won't budge an inch at all-at all-but be after giving them fair play an'd a broken head wid it! Och murther! it's Murphy O'Brien that's clean dead and gone wid impatience te get howld o ye and use ve up intirely, ev'ry mither's son o' ye, it is. . Arra!! me hinnies bad luck to ye and ye'd be afther meeting wid Murphy O'Brien!" so saying, this pug- nacious son of Erin contented himself with a few cuts and thrusts at his distant enemy and. then very quietly returned the blade to its sheath. Night was now fast drawing its sable pall' around them, and they had run the stranger hull down to leeward; they still, however, kept their course till about ten o'clock P. M, when Capt. Parker ordered the ship to be put before the wind and every light to be either extinguished or so completely shaded as not to throw a ray out-board; then stationing his men forward and amidships. they were I directed to keep a sharp lookout and not     mate the lea st noise, and should they discov- er any thing, to pas. the word to him in t whisper. All hands w;ere now straining their organs ofvision in the hope of penetrating the dark canopy of night and discovering the stranger in season to avoid him, while the captain and officers with night glasses swept the hoizon.  The honest Hibernian who was on ordinary occasions the best look- out aboard, now that his imnpatience to get u howlid of divils" had fevered his imagina- tion, proved himself the worst. Ale was the first to leave his post and with stealthy tread approach the Captain, "Captain dear," he said in a whisper, "'it's Murphy that's diskivered the inimy, it is; and if ye'! be afther seeing the spalpeens just precede me d Murphey was very po- "te,) :' whte I iade 'he way, and I'll show1h yer the sarpints.- Capt. Parker having reached Murphy's station and satisfied himself that the Irish- man was mistaken, said : "I see nothing, you must have been de- i reivedr, Murphy."       k "Be the powers of mud, der ye mane to- say that M urphy O'Brien was alesaved, C:ap- ten dear? when he saw wid these blessed ares of his: own, them divils just out od sight ; here under me own nose. By St. Patrick i I belave the say must have swallowed them'  up intirel, obr by my sowl, it's nothing at all I can say. Now sure enough, and I do  atrap wid you, Capten dear." ', Capt. Parker having again charged him f to keep asharp look-out and to be sure he i saw some vessel before he left his post a se- d oend time, walked ait---leavin, Murpht stretching out over the rail and straining his  eyes to catch a glimpse of the "inimy-;, c now dropping on his knees and bringing his a eyes to a level wfith the rail, with one haud n shading his brow ("(an sure." sait[ he to Ca himself, "it Rapes off the light of the dark- 1 ness from blinding my eyes, it does,") he cc would twist his head every which way as he b; fancied he discovered something on the wa- n ter, and strove anxiously to trace out sonte w frm in the 'urky darkness before him; now r hi rising and drawing himself up to his utmost r1 height he would bend over the rail and with wt lengthened neck seek to throw his gaze along th the surface of the water.  It was while executing a feat of this kind sC that the ship made a heary plunge, and half .en drowned him with waterandspray. Crawl- ha ing in boardand shaking it from his clothes, qu while he endeavored to clear his throat from me the brimy stream which had thus uncere-.wa moniously been forced down it, "Arrah, me w^l jewel! bad luck to yer fir yer perliteness--.of an ye'l be after taking in washing, itfs tour- hoe phy O'Brien would thank ye t5 lave him to reS1 do his own, he would." Scudding before wind, the ship kept on her fete course, without, as yet, falling in with the bei] !hooner--.he wind, which, till twelve o'clock at blew fresh from the westward, after that hour wo ran to lull! anti ere morning had settled obti iowan ito dead aim. Day;ight discovered i on 1   'or- to their astonished senses the dreaded in d schoone: within a mile astern of them! He heir 'this happened, wde bt briefly .how. After :ing night had shut in bath vessels, Pedro who ing doubted not the ship would escape if Her nandez insisted on keeping the schooner on ses her present course, suggested to him, that as ian soon as it was dark, she would ndoubtedly ok- put away bethre the wind, and endeavor to get run by them--and that the surest method na- they could adopt would be to do the same, the which (should, the ship indeed tryr the ex- :ad periment,) would probably bring the two ves- sels in close proximity in the morning. He- )er, nandez adopted the proposed course, and the it result proved that Pedro was ri ght in his ns, conjecture. Seeing no hope of escape from po- their savage neighbors, Capt. Parker briefly gh addressed the ship's company, telling them that as they might be sure the rascals would 's show them no quarters, he trusted all on :h- board would fight to the last, like true Brit- I ons, adding, "while one drop of British blood e- flows in our veins, let us show the scoundrels , we can die like men, and make our swords to drunk with their heart's blodd." "An' it's p- M urphy O'Brien will be the dith of a round ed dizzen of the bloody divils, it is, an' he only ht gits hould on 'em," responded the worthy Irishman, with increasingzeal in their des m' perate cause. t  The two cannon (heavily loaded  rith lo grape shot) were soon dragged aft to two concealed ports, the ship's ample coppers, n filled to the brim with water, rapidly made ie boiling hot--while a small garden engine on - deck, with a short hose, was in readiness to y be supplied with the heated liquid. All s hands, armed to the teeth with pistols and "cutlasses studiously concealed, now quietly s awaited the approach of their savage ene- d mies, who, with the aid of sweeps, were fast o coming up with them. The ship's ports had - been concealedt by a thin strip of painted * canvas, and at the two ports having the best ' bearing on the enemny, the cannon were placed, with their muzzles close in contact : with the canvas. Stationing here a few of * his best hands, Capt. P. ordered ,them to lie close to the deck, and not fire till he gave the word-then, assigning to each man his post the engine in charge of De Castro and the cook, and Count Montmorency, with three stout men (one of'whom was lMurphy) at the entrance to the cabin within which Elizabeth had now retired, he took his station on the quarter-deck where he could see every move ment of the enemy, and waited with u wavering courage the approach of t'. schooner. Ye who have stood on the dec' of a national ship nearing the enemy wi ' hostile intent, have noticed the sterln ana resolute expression stamped on each ship-1 mate's countenance, and the almost savage ferocity that shot from each eye, when al being ready for the first discharge, every mar at his post, the enemy hard aboard--the wORDa is delayed, till a nearer approach is obtained. What a death-like stillness reigns on board! how rapid each PulsE! how rigid   achl featare! how-dilated the nostrils! now , firmly set the lips.! andti how the hand clutches the deadly weapon in its grasp! so stood that little band on board the Conradg- but the combat is not to be conducted on fair and honorable terms, with nearly an equal chance of success; it is to be marked by sav-. age brutality-certain death staring them in the faces, should they quietly surrender, and no less certain should they contend with the heavy odds against them. Notwithstanding this painful conviction, their hearts were filled with that stern resolve which knew no wavering. As Count Montmorency held his beloved daughter to his aching heart, and with moistened eye, commended their souls tO God, he imprinted a farewell kiss upon her lips and sprang to his post, as a hail came from the schooner to let go topsail halyard. "Aye, aye, let go topsail halyards," respond- ed Capt. Parker, and the top-sail yards set- tled home. The schooner was now close under their stern, ant ranging alongside, her decks crowded with the sa vage rascals, and fortunately on the same side with the engine. Tearing away the canvas from the-ports where the cannon were stationed, the word was given.  Dreadlul was the slaughter among that crowded nest of demons, when the cannon belched out full among them the deadly messengers with which they had been ] charged. The affrigihted survivors oe the piratical crew recoiled for a. moment, then, with horrid, demoniac yells, brandished their cutlasses, and prepared to board. Capt. Par- ker, at the moment of giving the word to fire, had also made signal to fill the engine; which, being done, it was taken aft, as the schooner's crew sprang into their own rigging, fObr the purpose of boarding, the engine was worked, De Castro holding the pipe, and con- 'ducting the scalding stream full in the faces, and over the bodies of the pirates yelling with pain and blinded by the burning liquid, they fell from their rigging to the decks, or rolled into e sea, and jammed to death be- tween the two vessels. Hernandez, who was heading the boarders, received not a small portion of the heated stream, his face and hands being dreadfully scalded. By the aid of their weapons, they were enabled for a short time to keep the villains at bay. RBut  alas! what could such a handful of men do against such fearful odds! Nearly double their own number, who maddened with their scalding pains, yelling, foaming and swear- ing like freshy loosed demopns, now drove all before them, and sprang on the decks of the ship. Murphy, who had been like an un-. tamed tiger, restlessly .twitching and tossing about at his ost, no sooner caught the .eye of: Diablo as he sprang in .among them, spit- ting on his hads. and taking .a firm grip at the hahndle of thcutlass, exclaimed 't"Arrah,  me jewel, it's M1urphy O'Brien ye'd .be after  sazin! Och, be the power  of Tmud! m the bye for ye, ye black liber ed diyiil"-and  saying this, he knocked aside he pass made s , nt.. o- Diabio, no writh a a rok-handed C   r blow, sliced off the pirate's head, as tnough it I had been placed on a corn stalk. "Howld D on wid ye, nmessmates, and give Murphy a - chance at some of the divils." r I Pedro having cut down Count Montmo' I rency, at whose feet lay a pile of the scou.. -. drels, almost at the same moment was him- n self cut down by Murphy, who exclaimed, I "Take that, ye divil, for yertill manners." e Captain Parker having discharged his pis- ; tols, and broken his cutlasses on the head of e one .or two of the rascals, and having had ) the satisfaction of witnessing the fall of two or three others by his sword, now fell to I the deck, shot through the heart. De Castro too, who had something dearer than his lif0 ) at stake, fought with the wild desperation of "the uncaged lion, but at last fell, mortally ; wounded, on the bodies of those he himself had killed. Of that ship's company, Eliza- - beth and Murphy were all that still gave battle. Murp)hy, who seemed to bear a charmed life; fought with fierce desperation, but, at last, pierced by numerous bullets, and ', finding himself sinking, sprang at the throat of the most savage enemv at hand, and fixing there his dying grip, choked1 the wretch to death. As unheede  these lay among the dead, the pirates made for the cabin-three or four discharges from pistols followed their entrance, and then all was silent, save  the cursings and groanings of the surviving and wounded rascals.  CHAPTE XXI. ) , The Meteor, once more/rgfidaLnd thor- oughly overhauled, after hout three weeks' time spent at her anchorage, now got under weigh, and stood out to sea. After being out about a week.., a sail was discovered one morning to leeward, on the larboard bow, standing athwart the Meteor's course, (which latter vessel, by the way, was now-rigged as a barque) distant four or five leagues. The Meteor was imme liately put in a condition for possible hostilities, and bore down for the stranger with all her canvas set, while ;Ro- berto ascended to the fore-top-gallant mast- head to scrutinize her. "What do you make of her, Roberto?' hailed his commander. "I make her to be, sir, an American clip- per-built brig of about three hundred tons, carrying sixteen twelve-pounders, beside a long Tom amidships. I should take her to be an American privateer. No! there she runs Up old Qeorge's bunting. She's not English built-she must be a prize." ",Lets see," said Roderigo, who had now ascended to the spot. "Aye, aye, I see-she is a prize to Ilis Majesty. That's lucky Roberto; the knowing dogs seem to antic. pate our wishes, and come running along here when the craft can be of so much ser- vice. I hope they have not been so incon- siderate as ,to take out the prisoners. We could employ a few more hands than rwe ^*T     advantageously in manning both vessels. Come, Roberto, let's descend; we must have that craft sailing in company and under our orders this morning." The two officers descended to the deck-all hands were piped to quarters, and stood ready to board at the word. . "' We must save our ammunition, Roherto, we shall have need enough for it by and bye." said Roderigo, " beside, we must get posses- sion of the brig without crippling her, for we've no time to take her into dock to re- pair." The Meteor had not vet shown her colors, and had now approached within a mile and a  half of the brig, who seemed regardless of the advance of the barque. Soon lessening the distance to half a mile, Roderigo run up the star-spanuled banner at his peak and fired a gln to windward as a signal for the bri- to' heave to. The report of the gun, or the display of the stars and stripes, seemed to arouse those on boardl the brig from their le- thargy, and, for the first time, make them  aware of the presence of an enemy. Indeed they must have been under the impression ( that thoir neighbor was an Englishman, so  indifferet t had they been at his approach: t but now that their eyes were open to the fact f that an enemy by no means contemptible was hard aboard of them, all was disorder and ] confusion on boards and the bri- instantly  fell off before the wind, while their stern o chasers were fired at such a random sight 1 that the rocketting balls did no other damage t than to displace a few buckets of water from a the oean.  "Ha! ha!" laughingly exclaimed Roder-  izo, "  thank you. my lads, for your politeness fi in pitching your iron out of harm's way."  "Shall we give them a gun or two, sir, c aver their heads, just to wake them?"  n "No! no!   ou might hit some of his so sticks, and that would occasion us inconve-  nience. No! she is a beautifully sparred ( craft, and we will have her as she is. Stand ti by and board!" shouted Roderigo, as the ci Meteor shot under the starboard quarter of si the brig. "Board all!" cried he, and spring- es ing to the deck of the brig, cutlass in hand, G followed by his crew, he dealt his blows right q and left among the enemy. The great dis- parity in point of numbers, however, soon si proved to the commanding officer of the brig the utter uselessness of contending--and ti after a few slight scratches on both sides, he dropped the point of his sword, the colors yC were hauled down, and the American Priva- si teer brig Swordfish, prize to his'majesty's se sloop of war Fireflash, with a prize crew of thirty men, commanded by Lieut. Cutwater, di and two hundred prisoners on board, surren- lic dered to the Meteor. Presenting the hilt of of his sword to Roderigo, Lieut. C. remarked, 1I submit, sir, to the fortunes of war. May po I be permitted io ask the name of my con- of queror, and that of his vessel?"    bl "Most certainly, sir; but in  the first u place let me beg you to put up you- sword. he I am very willing to take your parol )f honor the    that y'u will not make a nostile tse' of , re while you remain my prisoner." ir Jieut. C. touched his hat and bowed low as'he returned his sword to its scabbard and "assured him that his confidence should not y be misplaced. "And now, in reply to your question," said Roderigo, "allow me to say-that you "have had the misfortune to fall into the - hands of that 'black-hearted,' 'blqood-mind- r ed,' ferocious,' 'savage,' 'lawless freebooter,' - who," continued Roderigo with quivering lip, "according to your papers, has stained :, the waters for miles in extent with the blood a'of defenceless- women, tender infants and f hoary-headed men-who, according to the same truth-telling organs, has revelled in blood and cruelty for the purpose of acquir- l ing filthy lucre! Yes, sir! behold in your X conqueror the monster Roderigo! and look,"  continued he, as Lieut. C. started back as- tonished, pointing to his crew, who were conversing with their disarmed prisoners in a free and easy manner, "yes, look sir, at my crew, to whom your papers have applied the dienified title of 'infernal demons.' See how their eyes glisten with savage delight as they bury their knives in the bosoms of your friends."'  "Surejy, sir," exclaimed the astonished Lieutenant, "you are jesting with me! Can it be possible that I stand in the presence of that man whom I have been taught to be- lieve was the most savage monster that ever trcd a plank. There must be some mistake about this; there must be two Roderigos; for when[ your name first appeared in our papers as an enemy to British subjects, your field of cperation seemed to be the British channel, and your deeds of daring were coupled x ith the most gentlemanly deport- ment tow ,ds those who fell into your hands, so far as regarded their personal safety and comfort; but of late the name of Roderigo (with one or two most unaccountable excep- tions) has been associated with the blackest crimes. One more question, sir, if not intru- sive-will you allow me to ask if you board- ed and captured a-ship not long since in the Gulf of Mexico, and left your card on her quarter-de k?" "Ha! what say you? my card! never, sir!" ' "Is not this then your custom?" con- tinued Lieut. C. "  My custom, sir-I do not understand you. I carry no card but my sword. Pray, sir, allow me to ask what is the latest de- scription given of the Meteor?" '"A description," replied that officer, " as different from your present appearance as light is from darkness.' Why, sir, the hull of the Meteor is represented long and sharp -so far it agrees, to be sure, but in no other point--for she is said to be schooner-rigged, of about one hundred and fifty tons, painted black, with a white ribbon, carrying eight guns, setting very low in the water, and at her main-royal-mast-head a black flag with the word Roderigo di it, in red letters."   "I have it-1 have it"--muttered Roder- Igo to himself, " the infamous scoundrel! Yes, sir!" said he aloud to Lieutenant C., "there is some mistake. V mu have not the honor to address that villa n. I know him well; he is a pirate of the tlackest kind, and it mist be of recent date that he has had the audacity'to assume my name; but all his devices are useless and will not shield him from that fate he so deservedly merits. In personal appearance, as well as in our vessels and crew, there is not a shadow of re- semblance. My name it is true is Roderigo -the vessel under my command is the Me- teor, but I sail under a Privateer's commis- sion granted me by the government of the United States of America-and am a sworn enemy to Great Britain till the stars and stripes float over the waters respected and unmolested by his majesty's subjects. But come, sir' I am under the necessity of requir- ing your corpany on board the Meteor; your baggage and any private stores you may wish, if you will point them out to my men, shall be put on board for you." This having been done, and the Ameri- cans, who were confined below, set at liberty, Roberto was put in command of the brig: the two huatred Americans welcoming their new commnandef with three hearty cheers, and asstring him as well as Roderigo that they were ready to follow wherever he might lead. Roberto had but little difficulty in se- lecting fromr the brave fellows that composed his crew a sufficient number to act as officers; and in putting the brig in condition for ac- tive service, her magazine affording 'an am- ple supply of powder.  Roderigo having given him his instructions, now repaired on board the :Ieteor, with Lieut. C. (the prize crew having been previously removed,) and both vessels filling away, stood in company for the place of meeting of the three British frigates.  - - One morning, Captain Fitz-Albert (who ha been called to Liverpool on busi- ness matters) dropped into a coffee house, and seating himself at a table, .called for re- freshnmeit. In. the same room were many visitors, (tisposed about in groups, all appa- rently deeply engrossed in the discussion of some very irmpirtant subject. Judging from the strongly marked expression of their coun- tenances, Fitz-Albert concluded some great calamity had befallen the nation-yet from the varied character of these expressions- some exhibiting'the most intense horror- others, grief-he was at a loss to conjecture the nature of the misfortune. But as an el- derly, good-looking gentleman, who with an occasional interruption of ": bless'yer" had been listening to a young man who. in a low voice had been reading some article from a newspaper-rose and approached the spot', where he was standing. Fitz-Albert ad- dressed him-  "Excuse the liberty I take, sir, but can you inform me what is the nature of this calanity which seems to have cause so much excitement?"   "Bless yer! have you rot heard the terrible news?" said the old gentleman, hastily hob- bling back to the seat he had just vacated, near to which sat the person who had been reading to him-" here, Thomas, my son, read the account to this gentleman, he is not yet acquainted with the sad affair." The young man immediately complied, and read as follows: "ANOTHER HGH-HANDED OUTRAGE BY THAT COLD-BLOODED PIRATE, RObERIGO, OF THE METEOR. "By the arrival of the ship Pearl, Captain Thomas, from Jamaica, we are enabled to present our readers with the following ac- count of a most melancholy affair, which has been related to us by Captain T. On the morning of the 2dt inst. in lat. --  on. --," says he, "we discovered a ship to leeward distant about four leagues, with her top-sails settled down, her sails in the ut- most confusion, and steering very wild, and farther off to the leeward, hull down, a schooner rigged craft going before the wind with a press of canvas. Concluding there had been some foul play, we stood for the ship and boarded her. Her decks presented a most appalling scene, no less than fifty dead bodies being strewed there, beside two poor unfortunates, who were still living, but nearly exhausted from the wounds which 'they had received. The hands and faces of most of the dead were dreadfully scalded, and all seemed to have been but lately en- gaged in a most savage warfare, the blood still oozing from their ghastly wounds. Ap- pearances indicated bad weather, and being short-handed, I caused the dead bodies to be thrown overboard, and the two survivors tc be carefully removed to the Pearl; ahd hav- ing also removed to my ship sundry boxes and packages of valuables, and all the light articles that 'appeared to be of importance, I then caused the ship to be hove to and left her. One of the survivors, I regret to say, remains in a, critical situation, the other has so far recovered as to be able to sit up and converse without much inconvenience. From the latter individual, I'am informed that he is one of the crew of the ship Con- rad, Captain Parker, from Port Royal for London. 'Our ship's company. says he, 'consisted of -twenty-four men, including officers, beside four passengers-Count Mont- morency and his daughter, and Mr. De Castro and servant--(the former gentleman being the one referred to as now on board the Pearl.) "Good God!" suddenly exclaimed Fitz- Albert, " it cannot be! my friend thus cru- elly murdered by Roderigo, it is impossible!" The earnestness of dis manner immediately attracted-the attention of the whole company. "But read on, sir!" said Fitz-Albert in a wild and hurried tone as he struggled 'o sub- due his feelings. After describing the efforts 'they made to keep off the pirates, the narrative continued, "Having gained our decks, the'/ fought with     the ferocity of tigers. We. held our own manfully for some time, and fought with the d esperation of men determined to conquer or die. Count iklontmorency's daughter was placed in the cabin, and well provided with pistols; while her father. De Castro's ser- vant and myself, were stationed at the gang- way cabin to protect her. The Count fought bravely, and the servant too cut down all be- fore him-it was however of no avai, their numbers were too great for us. After being engaged with them about fifteen minutes, I lost the use of my right arm by a pistol shut, while at the same moment another grazed my temple, and I tell to the deck stunned. How long I remained in this situation I know not, but on reviving I per- ceived Couiit lMontmorency had also fallen, and that I lay among a pile of ceadl bodies, while near me wa. the dying servant, with his fingers fa st clutching the throat of a dead pirate. I heard several pistols dis- charged in the cabin, and vainly struggled to free myself from the mass around, that I might be enabled to render assistance to the lady. At this moment fell on my ears the welcome cry of S;Sail ho!' from the mast- head of the pirate, followed by the order to tumble in board all. I shut my eyes, and  feigned to be dead, as the rascals trampled over me and hurried, on board their craft, nor did I dlare to move till just before you came on board, when, after much difficulty and pain, I suncceeded in extricating not only my- sel' but the Coun't, who, although senseless, I perceived still breathed. We did not find the body of the lady," says Captain Thomas, abut frorn the circumstance of the cabin floor being drenched with blood, and a shawl floating on the water alongside the ship, we conclude that she must have been murdered and thrown overboard."  The narrative then concluded with a description given by the sailor of the piratical vessel. All eyes were now turned on Fitz-Albert, w'.o, with his face buried in his hands, groaned, and wept like a child. At length when he appeared more calm, a gentleman of about sixty years of age, dressed inl  British naval uniform, with countenance full ' of sympathy and a voice of kindness, said to 1 him: "This unfortunate gentleman and his  daughter seem  to have. been friends of yours."  "Friends,"' repeated Fitz-Albert, strongly s emphasizing the word, "  they were indeed c the best and kindest of friends. To the t daughter I am indebted for the restoration of a beloved child, and to both I am bound in r gratitude for the utmost kindness and atten- p tion; and, finally, all three of us owe our f lives to the generous daring of this same Roderigo. No! not this same Roderigo. i This piratical scoundrel has assumed his e name. I know him well." "You know then the commander of this  pirate," said the officer hastily: while the n hers crowded forward that they might not a ly hear but see the man who had 'met face r   n to face the true Roderigo and his coaultr. e feit, and lived. r,. "Yes, sir," replied Captain Fitz-A'bert s "the description of the vessel agrees per- h fectly with that ofacraft that we fell In - with, and gave chafe to, when bound to -. Jamaica in the Britannia, but which vessel t escaped us in the night. We had a good - view of her at first, and Connt Muntmo- r rency (who was on board of us at that time) said he knew her well; that on a former oc- [ casion he had seen her lying at anchor off 1 Port Royal; that she was commanded by a gentlemanly-looking fellow who styled him.. 'self Count'Corregio and represented the ve- sel to be his pleasure-yacht." "But, sir," said the officer, will you allow me to ask in what way you and your friends are indebted to the true Roderigo for the preservation of your lives?" "Certainly," answered Fitz-Albert, (the injunction of secrecy extending only to such time as they might arrive in England.) He then detailed to his' hearers in glowing lan- guage the manner in which Roderigo had aided Count M. and his daughter, as related to him by the latter; rivetting the attention of all by the rich coloring with which he garnished the truth, making the conduct of Roderigo appear in the most advantageous light. In speaking of his own rescue he omritted nothing that might redound to the credit of his preserver, and concluded by in- forming them of his generous risk of liberty and life in 'placing them on boird the Britannia, which vessel he might easily have avoided had he been so disposed; but know. ing their anxiety to get on shore as speedily as possible, he waited for the frigate to come up, and put them all safely' on board, requir- ing only a pledge of their word that they would not betray him; "and now, sir," said he, addressing the officer, " think you that this man would thus cruelly have used my -friends? those friends too for whom he had twice perilled his life?" "Assuredly not," replied the officer; while "No,! no!" fell from the lips of every one ir the room :and the strong feeling of passion- ate hatred against Roderigo which but a mo- ment before' had filled their breasts, gave way to warm admiration of his noble and generous conduct. "But why do I thus loiter. here, when per- haps my friend is dying,?" said Fitz-Albert starting from his seat; and addressing the officer, inquired if he could direct him to the ship. "With pleasure," returned he. "My car- riage waits at the door; we will, if you please, visit the gentleman together without further delay." Fitz Albert gratefully accepted the officer's invitation, and was with him rapidly whirl- ed away to the Duke of Cumberland's dock, where the ship lay-stopping, however, on the way, to take with them one of the most emi- nent surgeons the place afforded. Arriving at the dock, the three gentlemen immediately repaired on board the Plarl, and introducing   :hemselves to Capt Thomas, were led by him to the cabin. Here they found two other medical gentlemen of deservedly high repu- tation, whose services had been engaged by Capt. T-- immediately on his arrival, and -Fad not left the vessel since they first came on board. In those low tones which the pre- rnce of sickness always requires of the voi- ces of surrounding friends, the two physi- lans informed Fitz Albert that the Count for the last hour had been in a deep sleep, a'nd from its effects they had the strongest hopes of permanent benefit.; that none of his wounds were mortal, but the agonizing sus- pense which he endured relative to the fate of his daughter, rendered his situation very critical. Previously, however, to his slum- ber, they'said he had appeared more calm, and 'had expressed a wish that his only re- r aining friend (Capt. Fitz Albert) might be sent for-that being fellow-sufferers, he felt he could bear his affliction more calmly, so- laced by his company. 6 Ascertaining your address, sir," conclu- ded one of the surgeons, ' we at once sent an express to Dover informing you of the con- dition and Wish of your friend, and we have the'happiest anticipations from the effects of your presence." Fitz Albert, after requesting them to an- nounce his arrival, proposed leaving the ca- bin until his friend should awaked-fearing the effects of a too sudden recognition. At this moment Count H-- opened his eyes, and with a saddened smile, extended his land to Fitz Albert, and said- "This is indeed kind, my friend." The offered hand was affectionately pressed in si- lence; but his swelling heart, quivering lips, and husky throat warned the sympathizing Fitz Albert not to trust his voice. Count M--  continued--"I had hoped--- " but ah!' the withering recollections of the past, with a mighty rush, crowded on his mind, and unable to speak, he bowed his head on his friend's shoulder, and sobbed aloud. As' the refieshing showers of midsummer rean- imate and invigorate parched and drooping nature, so tears soothe and tranqulllze the mourner's heart and calm the troubled mind. The Count experienced these blessed influ- ences, and in a short time was enabled to con- verse with comparative calmness and resig- aatlon. "I know, my friend, the consolation your kind and sympathetic heart would fain utter --and my conscience accuses me of the wrickedness of my murmurings that my child has been thus early called home by her Hea- venly Parent. The reflection that I am for- ever more on earth deprived of the society of a beloved andt only child completely unmans me. It is melancholy to stand alone, like- a tree shorn of its branches, its trunk exposed to the buffetings of the storm, and its feeble roots weakened by age, barely able to sustain  it--.no prop---" here Fitz Albert pressed his hand-.'" yes, yes, my friend, I do you in- Jun'toe-forgive me; I feel that I must and   can rely much upon your friendship for con- solation."  Fitz Albert, wishing to divert his mind from the contemplation of his loss, ;nquired how he felt since his slumber. "O, much better, thank you-I think I may venture ashore. What say you, gentlemen -n he asked of the physicians, who now ap- proached his berth, and who. had previously agreed that change of scene would be the best possible restorative for their patient. The eldest, who had come in the officer's carriage, having asked the Count some few questions relative to his feelings, told him that as he could be much bier. accommo- dated on shore, they would. if he felt able, remove him at once-at least as soon as they could procure suitable antdagreeable quarters. The old gentleman in naval uniform now ap- proached the party, and Fitz Albert apolo- gizing for the oversight, introduced him to his friend as "Admiral De Lane"-" to whose politeness," added he, "yon are in- debted for my early presence." "A debt which I ,-ratelully acknowledge, but am unable to repay," said the Count as he extended his hand to the Admiral. "It's more than repaid already," returned the worthy Admiral, "by the gratification af- forded me in being instrtumental in any way to your comfort. I was induced to come on board by the thought that you might possibly wish for moorings ashore; and I trust you will excuse the bluntness of an old sailor if I insist on- taking you and your friend to my quarters. No excuses, I beg, sir," seeing the Count about to reply, "I have a large estab- lishment, tolerably well located, with no one but myself and servants to occupy it; and I beg yca will both favbr me with your 'com- pany for so long a time as may be agreeable to you, and so far from giving trouble, I as- sure you it will be a pleasure to me Mv carriage is already at hand, and wiii take you to your quarters whenever you shaL command."          .  "Really I do not know what to say to yoau, sir-I cannot find words even to express my thanks for your generous offer; but I feel, and shall ever remember with gratitude, youz disinterested kindness to a, stranger."  "itranger! sir; why sir, I feel as though you and your good friend, Captain Fita- Albert, were old friends of mine, so much have 'I been interested in his account of the histories of both-beside, sir, I am under heavy obligations to you personally, for being the means by your valorous encounter with those'devils, of preventing their pocket- ing my dollars, which I perceive Captain Thomas has brought away from the ship.- So, sir, you will please consider me your debtor, and allow me to discharge that debt in the best manner I can; and now this set- tled, allow me to inquire if you find yourself able to bear a removal at this time?" Not wishing to offend by any longer op. posing the generous Admiral, Count M. re plied that he felt perfectly able, and would no longer refuse his generous hospitaliy.     The worthy ol. admiral was highly delight- ed at his acquiescence in his plans, and busied himself, with all the activity of vouth and the tenderness of an experienced nurse, in arranging matters for t,he feeble Counts transfer from cabin to carriage. After de- positing 'him there in safety, and seating Fi tz-Albert alongside of his friend, he closed the door and bade the coachman drive slowly and carefully, first, however, inform- ing them that he would be there on their ar- rival. The carriage having departed, the admiral and Dr. Warneton returned to the ship, for the purpose of inquiring Vnto the condition of the sailor, who they found in better condition than they had anticipated; the right arm, whichwas broken, had been set by Captain Thomnas, and was now fast healing. Slipping a fifty-pound note into the sailor's hand, the admiral told him he must call at his house when he got ashore; then turning to Captain Thomas,. as the sailors "God bless yer honor" fell on his ears, he showed him a bill of lading of cer- ,tain packages of specie to his address, answering to the description of those taken by him from the Conrad, and remarked, "I will send my secretary down in the morning fr them, who will pay all expenses."' Taking a kind leave of he' captain, they called a public coach, and arrived at the admiral's residence a few minutes before the carriage returned. CHAPTER XXII. Admiral De Lane's residence was situated on an eminenec commanding from the West front a fine view of the River Mersey; while in the rear a spacious lawn spread its bright green sward in captivating richness, watered by a silvery stream that quietly wound its  way in graceful curves across it. On the South, a spacious. and magnificent garden, * filled with the choicest and rarest of fruits and flowers enriched the air, making it redo-  lent of perfume; while on the North, the a the towering trees of an extensive park af-  forded shelter to bird and beast of foreign  and domestic growth. The mansion was     built of yellow stone brought from the neigh-  boring quarries, and had the appearance of t having once been an ancient castle; but mo-  dernized and improved from time to time by t the admiral, it was gradually losing its vene- e rable air, and assuming the appearance of a more recent structure. It was four stories'  in .height. its walls surmounted by battle-  ments and wall towers, which the Admiral i called t look-out towers." From the roof v rose a swelling dome surmounted also by a i  look-out, and commanding a wide aid exten- to sive view of the surrounding country. The F dwelling panr of the main building was girt I  mn the ground floor with a light and showy S Piazza, and me upper stories with neat iron si ^aiCajrnlfes.              n On either siae .' Ih'ne huume. tts comtor-t ji   t- loving proprietor had erected two bmsa id buildings with domes, each connected with th and corresponding to, the main building, e, which he called his "quarter galleries," 's using one for his library, the other for a con- e- servatory. The interior was fitted up with g I all the elegance and convenience that wealth 'd could command. The approach was over a 'e fine, smoothly gravelled carriage-way, wind- i- ing to tne main entrance between double - 'rows of noble oaks, and then, with graceful e curve, sweeping on either side of the edifice e to the rear. e  In this princely mansion Count Montmo- n rency and his friend now took up their abode. ; Here, surrounded with every luxury as n well as comfort, his spirits cheered and en- :t livened by the conversation of his friend, in- o terspersed with the many interesting anec- e dotes with which the Admiral abounded, and ;which he related in his own peculiarly racy e style, Count M---  rapitly recovered his S wolted health-though the never dying re- - collection of his belaved child hallowed his , smile, and impailted to it a sweetly sad and n soul-winning expression. One morning, I about a week after they had removed to the Admiral's, as the Count was slowly prome- nading his apartment, conversing with Fitz- r Albert, the Admiral rap d slightly on the - door, and being admitted when he proceeded 1 forthwith to a chair, a d seating himself. exclaimed, while wiping the perspiration from his forehead, "Bless your souls, my friends, I've met with a terrible mishap this morning. Taking a short cruise just now I ran'alongside and boarded Carlton Hotel; no sooner had I entered than Bonniface in- formed me that a gentleman had just in- quired for me, and as he was then in his room, would, if agreeable, inform him of my arrival. Nodding assent, a servant was despatched to the apartment, who in a few moments returned with a polite request for me to walk up stairs. Following the ser- vant I was ushered into the room, when I encountered such a battery of bright eyes, (bless me! I can hardly see now) that blazed away at me at such a rate, riddling my poor old weather-beaten heart into a perfect honey-comb, and blinding me so that I could neither advance nor retreat -so I struck my flag for the first time in my life, and that too, without firing a gun,. Captain Fitz-Albert, won't vou have the kindness to touch that bell? 'm in such a heat, I shall explode if I have not some water." Hardly was the request complied with, when a gentle rap was heard at the door, and upon Admiral De Lane's summons to come in, the door opened, and instead of the ser- vant, there entered a little rosy-cheeked boy, who, with the joyful cry of "'papa!" rushed to the astonished a d agreeably surprised Fitz-Albert. The child was followed bj Hardy and Cassel, with Helen and Henrietta, Smiles and tears chased each other in rapid succession over the faces of that group, a, memory, with her mysterious power, co, jired up the ligeht and shadowy sDots i1   the past. No formal introduction was needed, foir their hearts, through the med umn of Fitz Altert's commrunicatiohs, had long ago been closely linked, and all seemed and felt as members of n e family.  The little boy, whose adoptes mamma had never been for- tten, and % ho had been made to compre- )end her sad fate, well remembered Count Montmorency, and eagerly approached him. The Count took himrup in his arms, while ,he remembrance of the past now vividly brought Home to him by the sight of the child, filled his mind with crowding thoughts dimmed his eyes with bitter tears, and swelled his heart with painful emotions. The little fellow gazed in silence on that sad- dened countenance, and for a long time struggled manfully against the tide of sor- row that filled his tender soul as he essayed to speak-but the youthfnl heart has no knowledge of the shackles and bars which the cold world calls into use to fetter and chain down such emotion, and he could not -restrain the impetuous torrent, stammering out " poor mamma! sobbed aloud as he laid his head on the shoulder., and his arms encircled the neck, of the no less affected' Count. Sympathy lived in each heart, and ere it could be suppressed, an audible sob burst from every bosom. Even the Admiral, who prided himself as being able to control such weakness, but whdse heart was as 'ten- der as an infant's, and whose eyes were ai- ways the first to exhibit the sympathetic tears. (though stoutly attributed by him on such occasins to disease,) now suddenly fancied he saw something from the window hat required his presence (though the mist in his eyes precluded the possibility of his seeing a span's length) hastily :retreated  from the, room. Always seeking the happi- mness of his friends, Admiral De Lane, un- known to any one around him, had written  to Dover, requesting the presence of these friends, and stating that Count Montmorency was better, but' not yet in a situation to travel. It was not long ere Count Montmorency had sufficiently recovered to be able to walk out, and as the weather was fine, he accus- tomed himself to the exercise every morning, gradually extending his walks as his strength  increased, and often resting his still easily- wearied limbs beneath the shade of some stately oak. On most of these occasions he was accompanied by Fitz-Albert's child. who had now become his almost inseparable companion, and whose lively prattle served for the moment to win back his too often wandering thoughts from: the yul-harrass- ing scenes of the past. Ah! what a beauti- ful picture did they present-the silver- headed, care-worn Count seated on the sward, his manly and dignified countenance lit up ' with joy, or overshadowed wi-th grief, as the  innocent gambols of the child enlivened, or some flashing thought of the past scorched, his heart-and that bright, smiling, cirly,-  pated boy, with chubby arms and tiny feet, i ruaairg in heedless career after some bright.   insect, ever and anon tumbling. ove with foot entangled in the grass, but with joyous laugh renewing the chase, till encountering some pretty flower, he would forget all else, and with bounding'steps approach the Ccunt with the prize held high in his hand. "See here, grand-papa, what I've got for yu, and I'll go and get you a prettier one if you will not be so sad any more." The Count would press the child tc his aching heart, and tell- ing him he was no longer sad, would bid him run and let him chase him-and now the lit- tle'fell6w would make the air ring with his merry laugh as he gambolled over the giass, pursued by his "grand-papa"-for thus he had been taught to call him. It was while thus engaged one morning that the Count perceived an elderly gentle- man who had unobservedly approached an-1 stood near gazing at them. His dress de- noted that he mingled not in the gayest scenes of life, while his countenance, al- though it indicated the possession of a kind and amiable heart, yet bore a commnanding air and a firm and decided character. A their eyes met, the two gentlemen re? ted. each other. The stranger, advancing, begged pardon for the intrusion, but acknowledged his unwillingness to tear himself away from the child's joyous laugh, and from the pleas- ing exhibition of his gambols. " am exceedingly fond of children, sir," continued he, "and my love of witnessing their unrestrained hilarity often leads me to overstep the bounds of politeress, and, I tear. intrude myself within the noly precincts of the family circle." Count Montmorency quickly put the ta- tleman at ease on this subject, whose pleasing address and kind words soon brought the boy to a seat in his lap. As the group rested themselves on a grassy mound just within the Park. "I can  assure you," continued the stranger, "the frolics of this lovely boy have much relieved my heart of the sadness which oppressed it as I sought this shady grove-for my profession daily subjects ma to the sight of distress and suffering, which, alas! the skill of man or the power of medi- cine cannot relieve." -He then introduced himself as Dr. Sey- mour, owner and superintendent of a private asylum for those unfortunate beings' who have been deprived of reason. '; Being blessed with an ample fortune, and some medical experience, I knew no better way of making them useful to my fel- low beings than by employing them io the best of my ability in the attempt to reinstate to its empire disenthroned reason, and thank God, that attempt has not always proved un- availing. I have had the satisfaction ot seeing the countenance of many a poor sut- ferer again lit up with the smile of intelli- gence and health, but to the quietness of lo- cation, the s ubrity of the air, and beauty of prospect, I at:ribute these happy results, more than to he efforts of my own ,feeb.. skill."     Blave you mlany patients now, sir?" in- qaired Count Montmorsncy. "'No, sir--at lhis moment I have but one; a lady whose case, I am pailied to say, has hitherto entirely baffled-me, and which I have been forced to believe a hopeless one till within a few days since, when I have thought I perceived a mole favorable change in her maladyv." "God grant that your hopes may be realized, doctor. It must indeed be a pleas- ing remuneration for your benevolent exer- lions. to witness their successful results, and feel that you have been '.strumental in re- storing reason and calr-.ess, if not happi- ness, to those most unfortunate beings. But is your present patient very troublesone, sir?" "O no . far from it-she is as gentle as a  child, and conforms quietly and readily to everything required of her, passing most of her time when the weather permits, in fre- ,quenting a grove near the house;, though her more fiequent resort is an arbor looking out oi a small lake near the premises. Here she u ill sit for hours, resting her head upon her hand, gazing intently on the water with a most melancholy but sweet expression, while E at times she sighs and starts as some faint  shadow of the past seems to flit across her c mind." "Does she ever weep, Sir?" . "I have never seen her shed a tear. Wouldl  'to God I could see those blest soothers of an  aching heart fill her eyes, for then I should  fiel more encourag(fement. There is no balm w within the knowlege of man that to the over- burthened heart affords that relief which ti tears impart; quenching as they do the w scorching fever of the brain, and elevating the sinking despondency of the soul."' "You mentionerd, Sir, that you thoughtrv you perceived recently some indications of a a change. to what cause may they be tattri-hi buted?"3, "Why, Sir, a short time since my wife in- to vited a fremale friend to pass a few days with  us; she came accompanied by a beautifulo little girl of two or three years of age. Myto wile, patient, and myself, were seated in the he arbor before mentioned, when our friend la canme tripping across the lawn to join us. 'er e little girl with noisy laugh trotting along be- co fore her. Thinking that probably the sight sin of the child, together with her merry tones, ten might have an advantageous effect, I watch- sta ed the fac, of my patient attentively. As soon i is those sounsl11 upon her ear, she start- vis ed, and with a wilder look than usual seized I the child as t bounded into the arbor, and with a frenz e I embrace imprinted a kiss on Ant its cheek, then, with a sadrynile, put it down ful and seemed to forget its pre"/nce. The next taki dAv however, she prevailed upon the little dee   in- child and its mother were obliged to .l.-* us yesterday, ahd since then my pat ent has ne; become more melancholy. But, Sir," con- has tinued the Doctor, " if not exposing you to h I any inconvenience, it would afford me much ne, pleasure, and perhaps my friend shme relies ave if you would visit us accompanied by this nge little boy." "Independent of my desire to see this un- be fortunate patient 'of yours, Sir, for her un- as- happy condition interests me much," said er- the Count, "I can assure you the bare pos- nd sibility of the presence of the child being in re- the slighest degree instrumental in ameliora- pi- ting her malady, shad' induce me to accept ut your kind invitation at the shortest opportu- ie, nity. Perhaps to-morrow, at the close of the day, I may avail myself of your politeness, a if that time will not interfere with any of to your engagements."' of The Doctor immediately assenting, it was e- arranged that the Count and child should be er received at the mansion, only by the porter, ut at five the next evening, and conducted to ie the arbor, where he would find the lady with er the Doctor and his wife. a  "If I do not. tire you 'with my curiosity," le said the Count, "will you allow me to ask if it you are acquainted with the name or family e' of your patient?" "All the information I possess with re- gard to the unfortunate lady, it will afford  me pleasure to communicate to you. About a month ago a sea-captain called and in- i formed me that he had in charge a lady who wwas deranged, who came with him from Ant- - werp; that she was put .under his protec- I tion by the master of a 'vessel at that port, who not only paid her passage and that of a. female attendant, but also desired him to procure immediate medical aid on his arri- val, paying him some two hundred pounds in advances'for that purpose, and authorising him to draw, from time to time, for such fur- ther sums as might be necessary. I agreed to take charge of the lady, but declined the ffered funds, especially as my visitor in- formed me she was not in any way related to her generous benefactor, who had rescued her from some fearful danger, 'the particu- lars of which my informant was unacquaint- ed with. It was agreed that she shoulc come to my house the next day-and eve since she entered it she has appeared as cot tented as one could expect in her melancho state."  .  "'But has not her kind benefactor ever visited her, or written you concerning her?" ' He has not visited her, but about a week since, I received a letter from him, dated Antwerp, acknowledging in the mnost grate  ful terms my generosity, as he styled it, in taking charge of the .ady, and expressing his deep mortification t: at in consequence of s   He added that "e wal reduced to absolute poverty, and his sickness had Jeft him in such a crippled state Ithat he should be un- able' for many months I o resume his profes- sion. which he intended to do as returning health permitted, with the hope of retrieving his fortune, and in some measure lischarg- .ng his obligation to me. I replied to him hat he need not give himself any uneasi- ness, as I was abundantly able to spare the requisite amount, and concluded by inviting him to my houire, and there remain till his health should be restored; assuring him that my means were ample, and my fortune only afforded me pleasure as it enabled me to relieve the wants of' the deserving, being careful to couchl my invitation in such lan- guage as might not offend the well-known sensitiveness of a sailor's heart. I have not yet heard from nim, but confidently expect to see him in a few days." "I am  truly happy to hear you say so, Sir; we may then perhaps learn front him something more of her history, and trace her friends, who may now be mourning her loss." As it was getting late in the morning, the two gentlemen separated, and Count Mont- morency, with the chil d, turned his steps homeward. At dinner he related the events of the morning, which interested th'e worthy old Admiral so much, that he insisted on ac- companying his friend to Dr. Seymour's. Fitz-Albert,. too, would take no denial, and it was arranged that the child and Count should first make their appearance, and after a short time the latter should inform the doctor of the desire of his two friends, if agreeable to him, to make his acquaintance and visit his grounds. The following evening the. Admiral ordered his carriage, which soon conveyed the whole party to the residence of the doctor. It was one of those bright, mi ild days in September, so rich in its influ- ences that the heart seems to lose all its worldliness. and overflows with gratitude to God, and benevolent emotions to all mankind. The air was balmy, breathing upon the face of nature in gentle zephyrs--the rich foliage of the trees seemed an'imate with speaking life, and joyously conscious of the beauty of the day. The light fleecy clouds floated in rich relief high in the deep blue vault of heaven, and appeared smil:ing spirits, ar- rested in their aerial flight by the loveliness of nature-the air was redolent with the perfiime of a thousand flowers, and rang with the cheerful notes of innumerable feathered choristers. On the minds of our. little party, such a senie exercised all its I kind influences, and their countenances be- t tokened hearts strangers; to any unworthy i emotions. There'sat the good old Admiral, i whose weather-beaten frame had been .ex- posed to countless storms, at times giving j utterance to the most extravagant' enco- I niums on the beauty of everything around,  and at others hastily' dashing something l 'irom his eye, as .is gaze fell on the discon aola'e Fitz,-Alb/el or Count Montmofency wha sa brordln. rvr their thereavements. n   I[ " Come, cheer t p, myfriends, bur great i Commander aloft has seen fit to call int - port two of His most beautiful cruisers - who now ride securely 'moored in that Hat. . bor whither we aie 'all bound, safe from ieh tempestuous storms of Life, no longer to' - contend with adverse gales, or buffet the k heavy sea. of care and sorrow, that lies in - our ,cruise hele. Let's thank God that they did not share the fate of those who here and ,there dot the ocean of Life-unsightly ; wrecks--but obeying orders, kept on their course rejoicing, till they reached the Haven of Eternal Rest! True, parting company eve- ry little while with one another of our fleet, tends to make the remainder of the cruise more lonely; but should that make us desi. to keepy :ie poor stormn-tossed wanderer from her' moorings of sfiery? No! No! Let's keep on with stout hearts and cheerful, un- repining spirits-a steady hand at the helm and a watchful eye upon the chart sent. us from aloft; feeling assured that in due time  we shall join our companions in the port of Heaven. It is now' twelve years since I was compelled to part company in an unexpected moment with my consort (with whdm I had sailed for many happy years)-but she left me one solace, however: a beautiful craft- a rosy-cheeked prattler, the image of his mo- ther. Two years more, and this last rem- naant"-and here the Admiral, with averted head, passed his hand across his eyes-" was torn from my side, and God only knows whether he continues his cruise or lies moor- ed aloft. However, as we all sail under the same orders, I implicitly rely on his ability and disposition to bring us all again togeth er.' But forgive me, my friends, I have drift- ed from my object-I intended to have said something to cheer your spirits and induce you to wait more calmly and patiently the developement of God's designs, instead of which I have been tiring you with my sad experiences." The two gentlemen assured the worthy Admiral that, so far from tiring them, he had much excited their sympathy and had con- vinced them that they should more resigned. ly bow their heads to the will odf God. CHAPTER   XXIII The carriage had arrived at the Doctor's mansion, T hen the whole party alighted and entered the house. A servant in waiting having informed, Count Montmorency that the Doctor. his lady and patient were in the arbor, and that his master had desired him to conduct his visitors thither immediately on their arrival, led the way-leaving Fitz- Albert and the Admiral in the parlor as had been previously agreed upon. The child, with all the buoyancy of youth, careered gai- ly over the smooth lawn, when the path tak- ing a sudden turn, they found themselves in front of the arbor, where sat Doctor Sey- mour's party As the firs pfal of the boy's,     merry lauch fell on the ear cf the patient, she started with conlvulsive emotion, and raising Her pale hands to her head, hastily threw oack her long, dark, disheveiledl hair, that not one sound of that voice might escape her and leaned forward with wild and earnest air- intently listening. As she caught the first glimpse of his face, she sprang forward with a frantic bound and hysteric lauvh, crvinr "' God! my childl! and would nave fallen senseless to the ground had not the two gen- tlemen at the momlent supported her. That shriek--so wild and piercing had penetrated  the house. Fitz-.Albert sprang 'to his feet- i cGood God! that voice was her's!" and the next instant was beside his wife, chafing her temples, while the big tears of joy coursed his manly cheeks. The Admiral having joined then, after most stoutly, but vainly, trying to restrain his emotion, sobbed aloud. The Doctor, as soon as he could summon suffici- ent composure, represented to Fitz-Albert the propriety of withdrawing himself for a time belore his wile 'should revive; for should she on recovering iroom her swoon recognize him  also thus suddenly, the effect might be fatal. Symptoms of returning consciousness begin- ning to manifest themselves, Filz-Albert im- printed one hasty ki s upon her cheek and was hurried away by the Admiral. The Doctor and Count Montmorency remained to convey Maria to the mansion, and no long time elapsed ere they had the gratifcation of witnessing the restoration of her reasoning faculties. After the proscription of a gentle anondyne, they left her in charge of Mrs.? Seymour, and descended to the drawing-room. , The cheerful expression of their courntenan- i ces filled the heart of Fitz-Albert with joy, S and he could hardly refiain from immediate- ly seeking his loved Mlaria. The cooler e judgment of the Doctor and his friend, how- ever, convinced him that such i step would U he extremely hazatdous, and he promised to n await the proper hour with what patience he t could command. While seated together, ex- si plaining to the kind Doctor the particulars o of the rescue of father and child firom the tl wreck, a servant. announced a gentleman in b 'the ha-11 who wished to speak with Doctor be Seymour. Excusing himself for a moment, b he retired-but almost immediately rejoined d them, accompanied by the stranger whom he introduced as Capt,. Van Beehoven, the pre- server of their fermale -friend. Fitz-Albert cc had him by the hand in an instant, assuring m him that he could not command words to ex- fa press the thousandth part ot his gratitude tw and obligation to him-that through'his in-  strurnentality, his heart which had been sh scorched and withered with sorrow, was now w almost bursting with joy. Count Iontmo- bo rency was congratulating 'Capt. Beehoven vi, apon his good Ibrl une in filling so many I hearts with happiness,. when he was inter- soi iupted by the Admiral, who had been fidget- I f (ing about the room in much uneasiness. spi "Confound you all,"  he exclaimepd cai 4 you've kept my eye-scuppers running f6r fev t we last fortnight with grief, and now Capt. sla   he iBeehoven bears lown at the risk oi his lif ng and saves our I iend--the hong-lost wife is ew Irestored to the husband, anid husband and at ichild to her--and I, loaded deck down with ?r, your ecstacy so that my eye-pumps can ir, hardly keep my heart from foundering in 'st such a sea of joy. A's for you, Capt. Bee th hoven, I shall report you to His Majesty as ig a graceless dog, who perils his own life to sn save a fellow being, and as one who goes n- about robbing whole commnunities of their at I grief." :ld  The poor Captain was perfectly astonished - i at the extent of joy he had been the fortunate te means of diffusing, and was overwhelmed b; tr the expressions of gratitude that were show- is ered upon him. d  "How happened it, Captain?" said Fitz- o Albert, " for although the time I was confined e in the hold seemed ages,yet it could not have i- been long in reality before I freed myself; and e wnen I rose to the surface of the sea I could e not distinguish a sail or any living being in e sight. It is true, I rose to windward of the n i wreck, and from my position had not much  of a prospect to leeward." "That accounts for it, then-for I must have come up soon hfter the accident, as the :1 lady could not have survived long, exposed e to such a sea. We took the gale about mid- n night and scuded before it under bare poles till g about eight in ihe morning, when it began to f lull and we were enabled to get on our ship close-reefed topsails, a bit of the fore-top- - mast staysail and foresail. About noon the gale and sea having- much abated, I was  walking forward when I discoivered a speck in the distance on our weather-bow, and , sending for my glass, soon perceived the wreck. Altering the ship's course, I ascend- ed the fbretop to examine as we neared it. I saw it was the hull of a large ship bottom up, without a soul near her and the sea run- ning too high to think of boarding her. I thought ot heaving to and waiting till the sea had subsided-but., as I was about giving orders to that effect, my glass fell upon some- thing white in the water, just under our lee bow. Nearing the object, I perceived it X, be a female apparently lashed to a hatch-. but whether dead or alive I was uffable to decide, but resolved at all events to save her if possible.  "Quickly descending to the deck, I seized a coil of role, and taking a secure turn round my body, ordered the other end to be made fast in-board and the ship put off a point or two. We kept cur course till within a ha. cable's length of the lady, when, bringing the ship up into the wind. I jumped Over to lee- ward and made for her. Having, been from boyhood accustomed to the water, strong and vigorous, and withal no- a- bad swimmer, the dlanger was comparativly nothing. After some buffetings I reached the hatch, to which I found the lady was perfectly secured by a spike bent in the form of a hook which had caught her dress. Supporting myself for a few moments by the hatch, I hauled in thi slack of the rope an.. passing the bigf-' round ,   her waist and over my head and shoulders, I secured her to myself; this proved quite for- tunate, for after having cut -her dress clear, and pushed off trom the hatch, a heavy sea drove it' directly at' out heads. Raising my left arm, I received the blow upon it, saving our 'heads at the expense of the bone-: the lady being secuAil to me, however, [ was enabled to use my right arm and thuj keep our heads above the surface, the -boys on board pulled with a will at the rope, and soon brought us safely on deck. The. lady now required ouir utmost care, for she still remained in a state of insensibility. Our unremitting exertions were, however, at last rewarded by her retuining animation, though we perceived, with deep regret, that her rea- son had flown, but flattered ourselves it was only a temporary affliction, and that by rest and careful treatment it might be restored. On our arrival at Antwerp I was pained to see no improvement in that respect, and hearing of your skill, sir," (addressing the Doctor) " and the calm quiet beauty of your location, I placed her in charge of a friend with an earnest request that you would receive her, intending soon to follow and personally exert myself to find her friends; but sickness and the loss of my entire property have hitherto prevented me from carrying my designs into effect, but, receiving a short .time since, your kind and earnest invitation, and feeling that the shattered state of my finances demanded of me immediate exertion, I could not refrain from accepting your generous hospitality, and have come now with a view of burden- ing' you with my society for a few days, hoping that, by the salubrity of the air and the aid of your kind advice, I should then be enabled to resume my p:rofession.'l The Captain was soon put at ease on this point, by Fitz-Albert and the Doctor.' The evening having now far advanced, the car-- riage was ordered. I The Admiral and Count Montmorency returned home, leaving theki' friend and his child with the Doctor, pro- mising to look in upon them early the follow- 1 ing morning.              ( But we must now return to the Saucy ( Jack, (for so the. piratical schooner was 1 named in honor of the one lost in the Gulf of l Mexico) which, our readers will remember - we left in chase of the Conrad. Never did i the demoniac heart of Hernandez sit so lightly in his bosom, as when, pacing the quarter- i deck, he witnessed their rapid approach to .1 the ill-fate4 ship. Revenge and avarice, the E master-spirits of his blackened soul, now promised him a rich banquet, and that too i without much hazard; as he felt confident e that those on board the Conrad, when they f should see/the force he broughu against them, c would' nrme no resistance but quietly surren- b der theaselve; to his' tender mercies. Al- t ready, in imagination, Ihis fingers clutched n the money-bags of the wealthy Jew, and his-  eyes glistened with avaricious satisfaction as s' he thought  f the costly jewels and glittering f( diamoldis of which he was about to possess I s] himself. Bul there was another cause -of it   I satisfaction which e\en to his sordidl odS t- gave more joy than all the anticipated wealith r, --the opportunity of wreaking his revenge a upon the defenceless Elizabeth. Ah! he lit- y I tie knew the hearts of oak that surrounded g her, and the indomitable courage of that lit- e tie band of Britons, who, sword in hand, s stood ready to receive him. No! he dream- p ed not of resistance where resistance would n be so unavailing, but gave himself up to the d thought of full and ample vengeance. Out y readers know at what cost he purchased it 1 and how warmly he was received on boatre r the Conrad. It was some hours after they t had quitted the ship ere he became conscious of his .situatidn, anti, as he lay in his berth - maddened with the pain of his wounds and s scalds, (for he had received a good portion of t the' boiling stream from the engine,) he gave t vent to his rage in loud imprecations and e curses 'upon his ill-luck-but as his eye fell upon Elizabeth, who was secured in his } cabin, it dilated with savage joy that he was , not entirely baulked of his revenge. ("Were it not for these' cuired wounds," , he inwardly exclaimed, "that pin me to my berth, I would soon cause yonder proud thing ' to change her tone. Well, she cannot now escape me, and a few days' nursing will put me on my feet again. Meanwhile she can improve the'opportunity in making up her mind to be resigned to her fate. As for that English loon of her's, he may as-well con- tent himself that he will never see her again. A few weeks of this prosperous. breeze, and he may exercise his wits forever in search of me and my prisoner.' ".I say, Jack," said a burly-headed sea- man: of the piratical crew, whose scowling visage was rendered more repulsive by a num- ber of deep and severe scars, "I say, them ere beefeaters- fought like very devils. Did you ltwig 'that ere Paddy, how he sliced away at us, and how quick 'he made mince- meat of Diablo and some dozen more of us? May I .be keel-hauled if I didn't clap my barkers close aboard his daylights and let' drive at him without. injuring his hull. ' I'm d-d,' said I,? but you must be the devil himself. ' An shure,' said ihe,' an have ye been all this time finding that out? By St. Pathrick, it's Murphy O'Brien wouldn't be afther kaping you in ignorance at all-at all -So take that, you owld divil!' and at tha he came down upon me with a blow athwart my bow-port, which laid me o n my beam. ends in no time." "But Pat was nothing to that ere she-devil- in the cabin," responded another, "for after we had cleared the way and cut down all be- fore us, some half dozen of us entered the cabin--but my eyes! how she handled them barkers! Two of our messmates came to their last mooring directly, and two more made sail after 'em before you could say Jack Robinson, leaving only Bill Oakum and my- self. The next minit one on us was keel up, for having discharged the last of her barkers, she let drive one on 'em a' me, which com- ing aboard my daylights c osed my ports and     I sa^ no more till I saw Bill carrying her into o ir cabin. "Well, messlates," said Oakum, who lay among the zroup, "I'm thinking thecaptain gets more titan his share, for besides his part of the blunt, he intends keeping the gal to himself. Now, boys, I'm d-d if this is fair, and Bill Oakum is one that won't stand it; for look'ee here, messmates, I happen to know this shore-going frigate, and I know too, that we could get more than twenty thousand dollars for her from her friends and no questions asked; and I'm thinking that the captain sho'uld-be looked after, for you know. Jack, from what we saw of her in the carin that she'll never haul her flag down, and should the captain haul too closely along- side she may give us the slip, and take her departure aloft. Besides, messmates, we've been kept for the last three months dodging about Jamaky and in the wake of them cur- sed cruisers, all for this gal-while the cap- tain has been trying to blind our eyes with the idea that he was watching after the blunt.', "That's your sort, Bill." replied Jack, K them's my sentiments,' as the shore-going, yarn-spinning gentry say. Tip us your flip- per, Bill, for I'm -.d if Jack won't back you in that ere proposition." "But avast, my hearties," said another, "how can you manage to get the blunt for the gal and-nor a hempen-cravat for our necks. I've hearn say that dead men tell no tales, and I suppose the same consarns wo- men." Now belay there, Tom," said Bill, "and let me'alone to manage this, and if 1 don't get the blunt without risking your necks, why then say that Bill Oakum is a d-d land- lubber, and that's what I'm thinking none of you will care about saying till you have my permission."  While thus engaged in discussing the matter, the report of a pistol came from the cabin. In a moment some twenty of them rushed aft with their knives drawn and en- tered the cabin, headed by Oakum. Here they confronted the captain, as he stood with one hand grasping his sword and in the other a pistol. In a voice husky with rage, not unmingled with fear, he demanded of them how they dared come aft, and what they wanted.                 I "Why, hark'ee. captain, as for daring, you  know we can dare anything-and as to what t we want, we heard the barkers and want tc  know what it was for."  "'That's none of your business, you scoun- drel: go foreward this instant," shouted s Hernandez, as rage overpowered his caution  and cowardice. "Fire and furies!" cried he,  as he harmlessly discharged his pistol at the  head of Oakum, who, with books of defiance. coolly refused to leave the cabin till they were satisfied.             r "Come, captain, none of v-ur nonsense-  for you see, an we were & mind to it, we  att d send your craven soul to the devil's  wo, A e in 'monment. But that arn't our '   object at present--weve been having a bit of a yran'for-ard, consarning this ere gal, and have come to the conclusion that, an her friends being willing to fork over the blunt pretty freely, and not molest us, we'll let her make sail for her moorings ashore." "God bless you, men, for that decision!" exclaimed Elizab th, "you may depend not only upon having gold enough, but I will pledge you my word that you .;hall not be molested." "Well, men," said Herdandez, who now began Ito see the extent of the mutiny, and the importance ot humoring the crew, '; well1 I suppose you are tired of living a free and easy life, and are desirous of making some amends!or the thousands you have butchered in cold blood, that you cannot wait for his Majesty's'cruisers to overhaul you, but must needs inform your enemies where you are. In order to make the matter more sure, you must also send a living witness to identify you; you may, if you please, go and offer up your carcasses to make pennants to the yard- arms of the first man-o'-war you fall in with. As for lnyself, I much prefer roaming where I please, my own master. As for the money you expect To get from the friends of your prisoner, you may make yourself easy on that score-for. she. has now no friend, her father having very foolishy sacrificed his life for her on board the Conrad.' "That's a d--d lie," said Oakum, "she has manv a true friend, to my sartain knowl- edge, ifi old England, who would load our craft decks-down with gold for her, and dammelif Bill Oakum won't let daylight into anybody that offers to harm her aboard this craft, (for her kindness to his old woman when she slipped her cables). Aye, aye, captain4 you Mnay grasp your slicer, but offer to use it against me or her, and by the God that made me, the devil shall feast on your carcass the next moment!" 6 All on board the Saucy Jack knew that the thieats' of Oakum were not' idle wind; for desperate as those men were, no two of then would dare attack him, even had they been inclined--which they were not, for he was a favorite with all on board, except the commander, who, perceiving at this time that the crew were determined to back Oakum, said, "Well men, if you will have it so, I am agreed; so seek your quarters, and we will make the first safe port and convey inte li gence to the prisoner's friends that we art ready to give her up on the conditions you have mentioned." "That's your sort," said Oakum, "ana seeing as how Pedro has missed the number of his mess, and you have a spare berth in the cabin, Tom and myself will stop here ani keep you company, for fear you might change your mind." Hernandez, with apparent cheerfulness, readily assented, determined at the firstfitting opportunity, to punish the rascals for their audacity ; not doubting that he possessed the wily art which would enable him, bye and bye, to turn the c:ew agains Oakumn and to   take them side with him. Knowing well their love of money, he intended to offer them from his own gains as much as they could reasonably expect from the friends of Eliza- beth, on condition that they condemned Oak. utr to death forexciting them to mutiny, and tefi Elizabeth to him. After settling the matter with the crew to his satisfaction, then Hernandez intended to run- for their rendes- vous and, 'having secreted the'money, sail fir some unfrequented inlet on the northern side of Jamaica and making a pretext that he wished to gain information of the cruisers, and ascertain if there wa; a prospect of any valuable plunder, then repair alone to King- ston and make the best bargain he could with the Governor for delivering up his men, so planning his operations that not one of them should escape. The' next morning, his wounds proving less painful thad he had dared to hope, he made- his-appearance on deck, and calling his men aft, told them he had been thinking a great deal of their plans, and was satisfied that the prosecution of them would be attended with much danger ,to themselves, which he believed they would see at'once by giving the subject the benefit of a little cool reflection. "In the first place, men, you see we dare not go into any port where we could give the information we wish, and if we could, you may depend the Government would soon get wind of the matter and overhaul us; and notwithstanding the promises of your prison- er for her friends, she would be compelled to give hier evidence against us, which you know would give us all a hempen-cravat forthwith. It is fair, however,. that you should not lose the money which you hoped to obtain by her release, and I have, there- fore, made up my. ind to pay you twenty thousand dollars for her on two conditions- first, that you shall not interfere in any way with my plans in regard to her, and seconi, that Oakum, in consequence of his threats to your commander and his endeavor to excite you to mutiny, be condemned to death at this time to-morrow. 'What say you, men? will you .take the twenty thousand without any risk, or will you run your necks into the noose so long prepared for you on shore?" The tempting offer was not thrown away upon the black-hearted rascals. Even those wmho had previously agreed to stand by Oak- utm, now began to form themselves into groups and discuss the matter with an inclination evidently favorable to Hernandez. "Aye, aye," said Oakurm, who stood by with a withering look upon his brow, as he saw those on whom he had most depended; now wavering, " aye, aye,. ye lubbers, I See the captain's yarn has taken ye all aback. Well, tack 'ship if you like, but take Bill Oak- um's word for i:, you'll go to the devil hand over fist. But I see 'taint no use argifying the matter with yon-take the blunt from the captain an ye like, but damme, if a mo- ther's son of ye lays hands onme, I'll make all the devils of h---1cuit monkey-shine, over your iea;l carcass s   "Seize him, -men, 'and down with him! i cried Hcrna-ndek, "are ye afraid of one man: I that ye stand thus to be bullied by himrr.?" "Come on, my hearties!" said Oakum, as he whipped out his cutlass at the approach of some dozen of the crew who were deter. mined upon taking up with the-captains offer, "there, take that you lubberly cats- paw!" exclaimed he, as he cut down the iforemost man, and one after another fell be fore the resistless, death-dealing weapon, while Oakum bid fair to effect by the use of his cutlass, a change in his favor, which he failed to do with his tongue. At this instant, however, Hernande, stealthily creeping behind, struck him a vio- lent blow over the head with a boarding-pike and he fell stunned to the deck, but the cap- tain quickly measured his length beside him by a blow from-the fist of Tom, who spring- ing over the prostrate Oakum beat back the men, crying: "Avast there, ye lubbers, fair play's a jewel! Let's take him below and, confine him, for he's not dead yet, and qo-morrow we'll hear his yarn and give him the benefit of a court-martial.5' His comrades readily assented,to this ar- rangement, more especially as they knew by their own laws he must now die, having drawn his sword upon his comrades, and they began, too, to feel a little ashamed of their meanness in breaking their word tc him. Oakum was, therefore, carried below and as he continued insensible, they bmitted to bind him, leaving him to recover at his leisure. Hernandez, after lying, some time on deck, gradually recovered his senses, and rubbing his eyes to rouse his faculties, pick. ed himself up, and with a dogged and re. vengeful look retired to his cabin. Throwing the bodies of their dead com- rades overboard, the crew huddled- together about the decks in silence; a thick, chilling fog having settled down upon the vessel, -so dense that an object could hardly be discern- ed across the deck. Leaving this den of de- mons enshrouded in the mist, we will, with the readers. permission, repair on board the Meteor, which vessel, it will he remembered, we left in company with the Privateer Brig, recaptured from the enemy. CHAPTER   XXIV, "Carlos"' said Roderigo, to. the individu. al appointed to Roberto'sberth, when the lat, ter was in command of the Privateer, "I'm thinking we must be near the track of that scoundrel Corregio, who, I doubt not intend- ed to overhaul the Conrad--but that vessel must, I think, have escaped him, having somewhat the Start of him, and being withal a very fast sailer. I wish, however, you would yourself go aloft, and with your glass take a sweep of the horizon and let me know if *yu discover anytlkihia.     "Aye, aye, sir," said Carlos, as he sprang inuo the main-rigging and ran aloft. He bad, however, hardly reached the maintop, Oefore he hailed his conmmander and reported  sail on the 'lee-beam. "What ldo you make of her?" asked Ro- derigo. who was quickly at his side. "She seems to be a large ship, and, if I mistake not, hove to."  '. "I should know that rig," said Roderigo, looking through the glass, " yes, by heavens, it's the Conrad. There must be some foul play, or she would not be lying to, with this fine wind. Bear a hand, Carlos, keep her away and pack on all o ur canvas, and make a signal to Roberto to follow us." This (done, both vessels bore away before tile wind and rapidly run down for the stranger When about a half cable's length from her they came up in the wind--the lMeteor on h er weather-quarter and the Brig on weather- bow. Lowering two of his boats, Roderigo s threw himself into the fist, and, with a fore- c boding heart, was quickly pulled alongside E 'the Conrsi. Hastily ascending, he was t thunderstruck at the spectacle prosen:ted by J her deczks, the surface of which alost swa i in blood anti spoke of savage cruel butchery s Sick at heart, he eagerly hastened to the ca- I bin, where lay, stretched upon the floor, the ti four deai. bodies of the pirates, bearing upon o their persons convincing proofs that the t struggle hadlbeen a severe and desperate one. p With earnest and scrutinizing search, Ro- c derigo sought some intlication of the :safely T of Elizabeth, but in vain-all around bore t evidence of the most wanton slaughter,  h. "By heavens!" muttered Roderigo, "i'l s have this scoundrel's heart's-blood, ere I set th foot on landt aeain!" but rousing himself, he be cried, "man the boats, bovs, and let's get un- ed derweigh as soon as possible and see if we e cannot overhaul this fiend in human shape. in He cannot be far off, for this blood speaks of an a very recent visit." Having returned to his vessel, the boats sea were hoisted in and secured. The Meteor ma and her consort filled away and stood for the oT so Jth west, with a tolerably fresh breeze r from the south east. The crew of the Me- tak teor now assembled in groups forward, dis- loo cussing Hernandez' visit to the Conrad and he the probability of their falling in with him. for "I say, Jim," said one of them to his hus messmate, "did you twig the eyes of our dil captain when he saw the bloody decks of the bles ship? They seemed to loom up like them cpv fire-balls we saw t'other night on our fore- tear rial-mast-head just afore that last storm. Apr Well, I'm blessed if I shouldn't like to see thar him Iall in with that ere d-d sea-shark. you How quick he'd open the seams of his carcass cro. and send him to Davv Jones!  That re- her minds me of a yarn which if so be you're a her mind to haul alongside, messmates, I'll spin fron you. But avast there, let's splice the main- turn brace first, for here comes old Ebony with soon og.  Ah! my old ace of spades, haul wo alongside here, and give us a drop of your " good old Jamaky, and don't stand there our   rang ( showing your ivory like wh te washe mluik He stones in a bed of c larcoal.'- Itop, "Yah! yah massa Jack, you b( always rtetl poking fun at old Sambo when him cum for you splice de main-brace." Ro-  a"Belay there, Sambo, and tip us the crib, ter, for you see, we are choked with rage at f I the sight on board that ere ship just now- so bear a hand, my hearty." go,  The important matter of splicing the main mns, brace being now concluded, the men remind. oul ed Jack of his promise to give them a yarn. his So, taking a quid and giving it a turn or two her in his mouth to freshen his memory, he corn- ke menced- "You must know, messmates, it's now lie some ten years, more or less, since I sailed er. from Portsmouth on board his Ilajesty's ship er, Terrible, on a cruise up the Mediterranean. on Well, you see, our first Luflf-a gentleman 'r- every inch of him, God bless him-was ro spliced about a week before we sailed to one e- of the neatest-rigged, freshest-looking, shore- de going craft that ever poured broadside into as .the heart of a Blue-Jacket, or ever caused by Jack to down his 'colors. So on the morn. m ing of our departure, she came on board to y. see our ship and take leave of her husband. a- I think I see her now-Lord bless her pretty ie timbers-as she leaned over the quarter to ,n our first Luff, who stood beside her trying ,e to cheer her; but 'twarnt no use, for the e. poor thing took on dreadfully-tfor you see - messmates, her heart clung to him like as y Tom did to the fore-rigging t'other day when e that sea shipped him for life, it came Cather hard on 'em to he obliged to part conlpany after 1 so short a cruise together. Howsumdever t there was no help for it and orders having  been given to get underweigh, our Luff help' - ed her over the side and took his leave with : eye-scuppers pretty well choked up. I was , in the pinnace alongside to row her ashore, f and as she put her foot on the gunwale, I took her little flipper and handed her to a seat in the stern sheets. 'Come, cheer up, marm,' said I, 'for Jack Trysail' is no fool of a nurse and if your husband should hap- pen to be sick, you may depend, marm, 'll take good care on him for your sake,' for she looked so water-logged with grief that my heart felt as heavy as our kedge out of pity for her. But when I told her I would be her husband's nurse, damme if her little peepers didn't dance with joy as she turned her blessed little pretty face towalds me, a'l covered with smiles glistening behind her tears, like the sun taking a squint behind an  April shower, and said she, ' o do, JBack, that's a good fellow, and take this to buy your sweetheart a keepsake,' slipping a crown into my. hand. So fearing to offend her by refusing the money, I thanked and told her I would send it to my Nance a 'a present from her. Having landed the ladly, we re. turned on board, got underweigh, and were soon standing down Channel *with a good wholesale breeze. "The tenth night out about midnight, as our Luff and me were hearing a bit of a'   yarn 'bout his consort, all on a sudden. we heard a scream right under our lee bow, like some woman in distress hard aboard on us. "uff!" cri d he to the mall at the wheel, 'or we shall be into 'em!' While his face turned, as white as a snow-bank, and' wechoth sprung to the lee side to see what was the matter, but there was nothing in the water. The Captain coming on deck at this moment (for the cry was heard in every part of the ship, bringing the whole crew on deck) or- lered the ship hove to and the boat to be manned, to see If we could find the sufferer. Our Luff' 'umped into the starn sheets as soon as the boat was alongside, and me and some six or seven others pulled around, the aip for more than an hour., but could not dis- df ver anythingo-so the boat was ordered alongside, and we made sail again. It made my heart ache to see our Luff so down in the mouth after we come aboard, fobr he believed that scream came from his wifeand was an ill omen. His grief laid him on his beam- ends, and when we arrived at Gibralter he was btthut little more no1r a skeleton of bones;  so he applied to the Commander for leave of absence, which was granted, and I was al- lowed to return with him. Finding a vessel just ready tosail for old Enigland, we took passage and arrived at ]Dover after a very quick run.  As we neared England, Mr. ; Treenail- that was our first Lutfts name-- began to brighten up and add more sheathing ( to his timbers, but there was a kind oi wild s brightness about his daylights that reminded i me ot the weather horizon just afore one of a them ere harryicanes slips his moorings and come down upon us with a whole fleet of furles screaming in his wake. As soon as d we landed, Mr. Treenail ordered a post- chaise, in which we stowed ourselves and o dashed off at the rate of ten knots for iMr.' Treenail's anchorage, which was about half n . a day's sail from Dover, where we let go I anchor about dark. Well, you see, mess- g mates, when we came alongside the house, all its ports was closed and looked as dull as s a ship lying with her yards apeak and s colors half-riaast. '  "'Jack,' said Mr. Treenail, with a sort of tl shiver, 'Jack,' says he, 'lay on your oars here a bit till I come out.' h, "'Aye, aye, sir. So I hauled my course a w trifle, and lay off and on for may be about  two bells, when I discovered on my starboard tl beam a tight little rigged craft, apparently st in distress; so I hauled alongside and asked hi 'her if I could be of any service--' for,' said d( I, 'your face hangs out the flag of distress, u and d-n me if Jack Trysail ever refused to answer the hail of that flag.       m "Well, you see, messmates, no sooner did so she near my name than shewas taken all aback, and says she, 'Oh! Mr. Trysail, such in dreadful news for your poor master; where is lit he?' and then she swabbed her eye-scuppers pe so with her handkerchief and took on so, sp that d--n me if my own scuppers didn't oc soon sring .a-leak too, for it's agin human natute to stand by and see? on' of -hem re m   re blessed little crafts with 'neir hearts water. ce i logged with grief and ready to founder s. without feeling for' em-so says I, ' Come, 1, Maria, belay all that arll doi't take on so, :e and tell me what's the matter with your h mistress,' for I remembered that she was Mrs. e Treenail's first she-officer. "is Well, you see, having told u,3r that Mr t Treenail was in the house, she hauled along- e side and we stood off a piece under easy sails - while she told me that the next morning af- e ter we sailed. a Frenchman, who lived in the neighborhood, and who had been in the habit s of calling in a friendly way, invited her mis- 1 tress, as it was a beautiful day, to take 'a e short ride with him in his carriage, 'and said she, 'my mistress insisted upon my go- I ing with her. We were having a beautiful 'ride and had beeni a long *hile out, when e my mistress observed that we were gradually 1 approaching the sea-shore, when she had supposed we were returning home, as (I dis- - remember the cursed frog-eater's hail, said Jack)' had told us. Being somewhat alarms ; ed,mistress requested the coachman to return, , when the Frenchman told him to drive on, and turning to my mistress, said, ' mine vere little dere, I shall take you on board my vere fine yacht, and shall take you to la belle France where you shall be vere happy,' and' as he attempted to take  her hands, she screamed aloud and so didl I. He then took out his handkerchief and saying he should stop de naughty noise, was going to tie it round her mouth, when I sprang upon him and fixed my fingers in his face.' " Think of that, messmates, to have an an- gry woman fix her grappelings into one's daylights! "' arved him right though, Jack," said one of his auditors. "So I'm thinking," said Jack, "but thUlat nothing to do with the yarn. Let's see where I was; aye, aye, I remembers-she had just grappeled with the d-d ' parley-voo.' "'Well,' says she, 'at that moment two stout farmers on horseback rode up along- side the carriage, and ordered the coachman to stop while they should inquire what was ) the matter. The coachman'refusing, one of them deliberately raised the heavy handle of / hiis whip and knocked him from the box, w while the other seized the reins and stopped the horses; then opening the door, there lay the Frenchman doubled up and on his back, striking most furiously, but harmlessly with his fists, while I contrived to keel his head down, with the good holdmny finger-nails had upon his face.' "Bravo! Jack,/ said his hearers, "we must drink that smart little frigate's health-. so pass the paniken and give us her hail."' "Aye, aye,my hearties," said Jack, rais- ing the can to his lips, " here's to the saucy little Bess Bellflower, God bless her little flip- pers!" and little Bess and' her flippers were speedily on the lips of the worthy sons of the ocean. "But clap a stopper there upon gab, mess mutes, if so be you're a mind to hea- the     Yain. Let'z see, where was I whe I struck adrift Aye, I reme mbers-the d-d moun- shear :ay capsized after the squall. "Well,' says Bess, 'there lay the French- man in the bottom of the carriage and I hold- ihg him down with all my strength, whilemy mistress, who had fainted, remained in one corner with the ban age round her face. As soon as I could speak, I begged the farmers to seize the scoundrel and take him from the carriage, and I would tell them all about it so seiziqg the Frenchman by the heels-, they dragged him from the coach and kicking him ' to the side of the road left him to take care of himself. They soon seated my mistress on the grass beneath the shade of a tree, and after much exertion on the part of the good farmers, she appeared to revive. She was assisted back to the carriage followed bymy- selfand ofie of our friends, while the other mounted the box, and learning where we re- sided, drove for home. The coachman and his master escaped, for our deliverers, in their-anxiety to restore my mistress, forgot to Secure them. After we arrived home . as- sisted my mistress 'to her bed, from which she never arose, the Aright she received hav- ing brought on a brain fever which soon  carried her off. On the tenth night after  fou sailed, about midnight, she suddenly re- r vived from the death-like stupor, in which 1 she had been lying for a week, and opening t her eyes which shone with an unearthly  brightness, while her whole face was lit up ] with smiles, said, "It is he!" and-with a I piercing cry of joy, she. added, "William, I my beloved husband, I come'--and expir- f ed.' "  As Jack came to this part of his yarn, his J voice grew husky and trying in vain to check p the watery messenger of sympathy that was A rising to his eyes, he exclaimed impatiently, a "Damn my eyes, nessmates, it ain't no o use, for you see the thought of the sufferings t( of that poor soul makes a child of me. But,"  said he, clearing his throat, "I'll finish the yarn:  "Well, when Bess came to mention the sc death of her poor mistress, she fell to sobbing c( terribly, and as I'm more likely to catch that a infection than any other, I turned my head lo one side that she mightn't see my face- a when who should I see, hard aboard on us,  but Mr. Treenail, with his eyes looking as r wild as a fleet of hurrycanes. 'Bess, said T he, while his voice slightly' trembled, ' may God bless you! I sha'; never forget your lo brave defence of your poor mistress, and your kind attention to her. I cannot now na express my gratitude, but the housekeeper I ;ill inform you In what manner I have en- yo deavored to show it-so good bye and God bu bless you!' Leaving her to pursue her way an home, we crowded on all sail in an opposite wl direction. After driving ahead sometime in co rilence, Mr. Treenail said, ' Jack, I suppose s he girl has told yot all, and the sad reason tin I  have to believe that scream  we heard on sel board the Terrible ti at mnight, was the voice f my bles ed wife. Well, Jack,' he conti ter   ck ned with some emotion, I have tscertainod n- that the scoundrel whose cursed hand has caused this affliction, calls himselfia gentle. h- man and is not far distant from here; now d- Jack,' giving me a bit of a paper, 'I wnant ny you to take this to him and wait for his an- ne swer, and harkee, sir,' said he with terrible As sternness, 'if he is insolent, don't you dart rs to take my quarrel on your hands, for by the Ie Gods, that man is mine and my revenge is it) all that binds me to life.' So promising tc qy reserve my fire under any provocation till m after my master was done with him, I took re my departure and made a'l sail for the ss Frenchman's moorings. There I was shown d into a room  where sat mounshear in his d slippers and gown, reading. Tipping him -s the note, he read it and turning to me began - jabbering. 'Begar, I shall have much pla- r shure in shooting in de head your master,  - what you shall call him? Mr. Two-tree- d four-nail. You shall tell him I shall be on n 'de'spot afore de day gets out of'his bed and 9 shall come with mine friend and fight him - with de pistol, as much as he shall like.' "Well you see, my lads, 'twas as much as - I could do to clap a stopper On my tongue i while he was jabbering away, so much did I - want to give him a piece of my mind; but - not wishing to deprive poor Mr, Treenail of his revenge, I determined to wait a piece, ' being resolved to board him sooner or later. So, making sail for home, I delivered the' Frenchman's answer which pleased Mr. Treenail very much. 'Well,' says he, 'Jack, I want you to act as my second in this af- fair, but you must not on any account inter- fere till one or both of us fall. Should I fall, 'Jack,' says he, 'you'll find in my pocket a packet giving you directions how to proceed. And now while I am writing and making arrangements for any emergency, you will oblige me, my friend, by seeing that the pis- tols are in good order and everything in right' trim.' "Well, the next morning by break of day we were on the spot and waited a half hour or so before the Frenchman hove in sight, in company with a little wispofa'thing, rigged as a man and sailing under his colors, but looking more like a monkey spliced on top ot a couple of handspikes. 'Ah! bon-jaw, messers,' said he, as they came upon the ground, while the principal, addressing Mr. Treenail, said ;- "'I sail have much plashare to see, you look so vere fine this charmon day.' "Silence, sir,' almost shouted Mr. Tree- nail, and take your post, for by the Gods, I fear I shall fire upon you ere I am, aware, you cursed scoundrel. No words, sir, but to business,' said he, as he raised his pistol and levelled it at the head of the Frenchman, who was about continuing his remarks, 'I come here not to be trifled with, but to pun? ish you for your villainy, and at the sa-n time give you an opportunity to defend your' self.'  ' "The-Frenchman, seeing the resolute de. termination of his opponent, shrugged h'   jotuders, *aid something atout three beans, (brs bien) and very coolly took his -place, pistol in hand. Everything being ready, it being agreed that I should count 'one, two, three, and at the word three they should fire. After I had said two, and before I had -time for another word, the Frenchman fired and Mr. Treenail fell on one knee to the ground, the blood streaming from his side. t was about .approaching him, when he said   .  "'Stand back, Jack--my opponent fired before the word, I kave .yet to fire,' and  evelling the pistol, fired, and. fell immediate- ly to the ground. Hastening to his side, I whispered in his ear that I[ would avenge him; then springing to my feet, with a brace of barkers in my hand, I told the French- man to load and defend himself. "'What you sail mean, sare? do you tink I fight de damn sailor? No, sare, I no fight you!' "' Then shiver my timbers, Mounshear Bull-frog, if I don't fightiyou!2 Seeing I was in earnest he let drive at me, without effect. 'Now,' says I, 'sheet home your topsails, you infernal scoundrel and make sail for the devil's kitchen!' and let- ting drive, he cried, ' mar-for,' sprang into the air some half-dozen feet, turned keel up and came down on the ground as dead as a herring. His comrade, in a rage, let me have it from a couple'of barkers at once, but they only scratched 'my larboard-bow, so' I clapped a plum into him and sent him on a cruise after his friend. lMr, Treenail now raised himself )n his elbow and asked me what the result was. When I told him that they had both lost the number of their mess, he squeezed my hand, smiled and died. I say, Tom, pass that paniken, this cursed fog is so thick it's almost choked up my throat." At this moment the boatswain appeared among them with his finger on his lip to1 command silence, and in a whisper told them to-man the two barges with full crews, every man to be armed to the teeth, oars to be muffled, and all to be conducted with the greatest possible silence. CHAPTER XXV. In order that our readers may learn the object of the movement with which our latst chapter closed, they must retire aft to the quarter deck, where Roderigo and Carlos had been walking while Trysail was spinning his yarn. 'It was during this. yarn that Ro- derigo, happening to lean over the weather- quarter, fancied he heard voices to windward. Whispering to Carlos to join him, the two gentlemen listened attentively and were soon satisfied that some vessel was near them, and in that lirection., Carlos letting himself down oirer the side, tried in vain to pene- trate the thick fog that lay 'heavily packed on the surfa e of the water.' Roderigo, tak- iag with him a small pocket-comnpass and   his glass, wcended the main-rigging to the , truck, and to his astonishment, within hah t cable's distance to windward, he saw the I tops of two tapering spars deco ated as de. I scribed by Oak tm, and from kis own know-l. edge Roderigo was well convinced they were , attached to the schooner commanded by Her- nandez.        i  Carefully noting the bearings of the vessel and how she was heading, Roderigo hastily descended to the deck, told Carlos to man the boats with the greatest despatch and ad Inoiselessly as possible. While this order - was being executed, Roderigo repaired to the cabin to prepare himself for the long wished- for encounter. After having carefully exam- ined his weapons, and well stocked his belt with boarding-pistols he ascended the deck. Finding the boats under the lee fully man- ned and prepared for a desperate conflict, he  gave Carlos charge of one boat, and tak- ing the other himself; directed bbti'to pull si- lently under the bow of the Meteor, his boat then taking the lead, the other Was to follow , close in her wake-till on a signal fron  himself, Carlos should pull sharply round under the stern, and run alongside on the starboard of the Saucy Jack, while his boat's crew should attack him on the lar- board. Previously to boarding, however, "Roderigo ordered both boat's crew, as soon as on the decks of the Schooner to endeavor to drive the pirates into the hold and secure the hatch over them. Sowell were his or- ders executed that the boats struck the sides of the schooner at their appointed stations, ere those on her decks were aware of their neighborhood. 'At this moment the discharge of a pistol in the cabin of the schooner, and the cry of a female for help, sent the blood with lightning-like velocity through the veins of Roderigo, who, with the cry "In God's name be lively, my brave fellows,'/ ! was with one bound on the deck of the pirate. Leaving the pirates to his crew, with a slashing cut to the right and left, he hewed down the two men posted at the entrance tc the cabin, and applying his foot to the doot with no very gentle impetus, the only bar to his entrance flew into splinters before him, and the nex-t instant he confronred his most deadly enemy,. ihose head, unfortunately had just escaped the bullet from Elizabeth's pistol, and which had grazed his forehead tearing off a little of the skin in its course At the moment of Roderigo's entrance, Eliza beth was holding a drawn dagger in her hand, while Hernandez was strongly grasping her wrist, endeavoring to wrest it from her. Both recognized him in an instant-the one, with a cry of .joy' the other, by a look ot deadly hatred, in' which seemed concentrated all the blackness of his envenomed soul, Quickly releasing his hold upon Elizabeth Hernandez made a desperate lunge at the ,healt of Roderigo, who parrying, the blow, cried :-- "I a! I have you at, ast, you doubly- damned, fit inmate of the infernal regions  thou cursed cause of many a broken hearl:     and deserted hearth, I send thee to thy mas- ter! Go, blak-hearted catiff!" exclaimed he, as with the lightnuing's flash his well tried cutlass fell upon, and Clove in twain, the devoted head of the villian. Hastily embracing Elizabeth, and congratulating her, Rodferigo went to the gangway to ascertain the success of his men. and to his satisfac- ion found that his orders had been literally obeyed. Indeed, the pirate crew, taken as they had been, by surprise, had not time to reize their weapons ere the cutlasses of their boarders were upon them ; and then flew into the hold before their incensed enemies like frightened sheep, wil hout'the slightest resis - ance. Returning to the cabin, Roderigo saw a sand thrust through a hole in the floor con- aining a folded paper; and as he stooped to sake it, the well known voice of Oakum came through the aperture. "I knew your voice, Roderigo-I have done my duty to the lady-now fly, and may God bless you, and have mercy upon us. The match is lighted, and in a short time our cruise will be up." Vainly endeavoring to persuade Oakum to fly with them, and being convinced that Lvery moment's delay was (Iangerous, Rode- rigo seized Elizabeth in his arms, and hastily tnanking Oakum for his brave defence of her, rushed on deck with his precious burden, tnd ordered his men to tumble into the boats vith all possible despatch as the schooner vas on fire near the magazine. All hands were speedily on board the boats, while the :rew plied their oars with a will rendered lesperate bytheirproximity to such imminent 1 danger. The fog, which at the time of their N coming alongside the Pirate had began to I lift, was now entirely cleared off and a brisk ( wind had sprung up in its place. The Sau- e cy Jack, being close-hauled, soon felt the in- . fluence of the breeze, and dashing onward v seemed conscious of the importance of a clear e sea for the final -departure of so great a p scourlge. Having now run out of harnm's c way, to the surprise of those in the boats she a came up in the wind, and Oakum appeared k on the taffrail waving his tarpaulin. 'Is it possible that Oakum could have v played us false?" said Roderigo.    c At that moment the schooner was seen to li shake with a convulsive tremor from stem to b stern-the next, a dense black/cloud rose a with heavy folds from the occ n, ad burst- fl ing asunder'with a terrificrepoyf filled the m air with fragments innume abl and the dis- w membered limbs of those  once compos- t- ed the crew of the Saucy Jack. Roderigo or ordered Carlns with his boat's crew to pull for bl the spot and see if there 'were any survivors, I while he should return to his vessel with sr his lovely prize and make sail for him- cl charging his men if any were found alive to d; bring them on board without molesting them. re As he ascended the deck with Sizabeth, his ' a crew immediately recognized her and mani- at tested their joy by three hearty Sheers for he sea safety, supposing her to havr been mur  -o   ds- I dered on board the Conrad. The compltmeal ed was duly acknowledged as Roderigo led her ell to the cabin she had once before occupied in, After spending a few moments in mutual ily congratulations, he touched the bell for Gon- er, zala's attendance and left her while he should in make sail for Caries, whom they soon ran up c- with on their return to the Meteor, having ly picked up one -survivor with no other injury is than a broken arm. Much to the satisfac- to tion of Roderigo this survivor proved to be ir Bill Oakum, who, in consideration of, his to services to Elizabeth, the circumstances of :e which were told in brief terms to the crew, - was received among them in good fellowship' Roberto, who, with the Privateer prize, had' a been lying far down to leeward becalmed in - the fog, had now worked up to them, and o coming cm board to inquire the cause of the i explosion was .areeably surprised on being introdt*ed to Elizabeth to be informed that e the explosion was the magazine of the Saucy Y Jack and that every soul composipg her offi-  cers and crew,with one exception, had perish- eed-" and that one man, I am happy to say, proves to be our good friend Oakumrn." Ro- i berto now returning to the brig, bot& vessels tgot underweigh and stood a south-westerly - course, with a fresh N. N. Westerly breeze. One bright, beautiful morning, several days fafter the events we have just -narrated, as , Roderigo and Elizabeth were seated on the quarter-deck, the latter remarked : "It is undoubtedly such mornings as this, Alfonso, which attaches you seamen so much to your, profession. I must confess such a scene almost weds rme to the sea, such a deep- blue smiling sky-such a vast expanse of wave with its gentle, graceful heavings as if mildly breathing up the prayers of the silent dead who in countless millions lie enshroud- ect beneath its surface-and this invigorating air, fresh from the heavens, uncontaminated with the varied taints that hover over the earth, how rich and enlivening it is! how it penetrates the soul nud fills it with emotions of gratitude to the all-wise and kind God, and good-will and friendship to all man. kind!" "True, Elizabeth, I acknowledge that no where but upon the great and majestic ocean call such a scene of mingled beauty and sub- limity be exhibited. But you must remem- ber, my dear girl, the ocean does not always appear thus- placid-sometimes lashed into I fury by the wild and fierce hurricane in its mad career across' its surface, it packs its waters into mountain billows whose crested tons seemn to catch the infection of the spirit *of the tempest and foam with rage. .Yonder blue vault of heaven, bright and beautiful as I acknowledge it to be now, does not always smile thus serenely upon the mariner-its clear arches are sometimes enshrouded by dark and heavy clouds, whose blackness it rendered more fearful by the forked lightning as with zig-zag course it hurls its fiery darts at the tempest-tossed mariner, while tMe heavy-peeling thunder seems in its solemn ;ones to be the dread voice of God himself   speaking to the heart of man, reminding hnm wlat a worm he is, and on what a thread fis existence hangs. The screeching ten- pest too, as it courses over the blackened, angry waters with ul-governable fury, howls anid shrieks in the rigging of the frail barque, seeming like the spirits of innumerable fu- ries intent on the destruction of all things within their reach." I And yet," said Elizabeth, " such a scene as you describe, fearfully terrific though it may be, is most sublimely grand and fills the heart of the beholder with alwe and admira- tion of the great Majesty of heaven ' who rides on the whirlwind and directs the stormt and who  has but to conmand and the elements are in immediate reo: ise. But, 'Al- fonso, there is- one reflection that chills my love of the ocean-the thougtl'o? the 'millions who sleep in its deep mecesses.-It is to me painfu to reflect how many deserted hearths and blceding hearts mourn the loved 'and cherished ones that have sunk to its cold em- brace. Oh! indeed it rmust be hard thus to die far away from earthly friends, with no familiar, beloved face to gaze upon as the soul ta Ces its final departure, and with not even thte 'onsoling reflection of resting in a quiet spot with' the dear and departed."  "Colhe, Elizabeth, let us change this sub- E ject-it fills the heart with gloom and crowds out the cheering influences which such a I norning as this is calculated-to inspire.- 1 When I last had the pleasure of seeing you s at Kingston, you may remember that I had b so few moments to spare that I forgot to in- t quire after the gentleman and child that were o saved from the wreck. Did the gentleman d recover his spirits and communicate any- f thing respecting the child?"      f "Yes, Alfonso,' and had I not felt so anxi- y ous for your safety at the time,- I should have v told you that in the child he recognized his I own beloved son." "Ah, thank God!" said Roderigo, "'We tl have then been instrumental in pouring into a his heart some healing balm'n-but was his ft wife on board that ill-fated wreck?" F( Yes, and we had the misery to see her is sink without being able to relieve her." in "  Poor creature O 0 that I had come up bit se a little sooner!"           fo "' Would to God you had, but it was not so yC ordered.

"Sail ho!" resounded from aloft at this no moment, and Roderigo hastily excusing him- he self, hailed the look-out- ot  "Where away?" a  " .Abo'ut three points on our starboard-bow, sir, standing athwart our hawse, under easy b- sail and looms up like a man-o'-war .9 is Ascending the fore-rigging, glass in hand, a Roderigo carefully scrutinized ihe stranger, - descended to the deck, and, after ordering a  signal to be made for Roberto to come on I board, and all hands to be mustered for ac- - tion, rejoined Elizabeth. " Yonder vessel is e our enemy," said he, " we must fight and I n doubt not we shall prove more than a match - for her. I was in hopes that ere we should fall in with her, I should be able to place you in safety on shore till after the conflict e was decided, when,. should my life be spared, s 1 would come for you and endeavor to restore you to the land of your nativity. But as e this cannot be done now, permit me to con- d auct you to the safest retreat my vessel af- fords." "Alfonso, since you must fight T am glad it is before you had an opportunity of putting in execution your kind plans rega*jing my- self-for I declare to you that so tong as you 'follow this profession, and I can command your affections, I will never willinigly leave this vessel while you are aboard. No! Al- fonso, it were a prudish mockery in me to deny that my heart and warmest affections are entirely yours; and, now that I am de- prived of my parent," (the circumstances of whose supposed death, were still fresh in her mind, and over whose fate she and Roderigo had shed many a tear of Sorrow since they again met,) "with no one in the wide woild but yourself to care for and protect me, it would be cruelty to drive me from you when my presence might afford you aid. May God in his mercy avert from you all harm! Be convinced, Alfonso, that the agony of sus- pense you would inflict by placing me on shore, would cause me a hundred fold more suffering than the danger 1 should incur on     board with you; so now," S;he added, while a bright smile beaned over her countenance "I beg you to consider me your constant companion, and attemprt nsto prevail upon me to leave you."  Pressing her to his bosom, he said," I submit dearest girl ; we are in God's hand and to his protection I commend both you and myself." "Amen! and may God give you the vic- tory and shield you from harm!" said Eli- zabeth, as Roderigo conducted her below to a place of greater safety, where leaving her in company with Gonzala, he ascended the deck, and found Roberto awaiting orders. Roderigo, Roberto and Carlos retired to the cabin. Roderigo slated to them that the vessel in sight was the Isabella-that it was his wish to avoid crippling her spars more than could be prevented-that he would lead the attack with the IMeteor,.while Roberto should follow in his wake, both. vessels using the long gun amid-ships as a favorable op- portunity should offer of throwing their shot on the enemy's decks, which gun, together with the waist-guns, were to be doubly-shot- ed-that in approaching the enemy they should reserve their fire until sure of their object-lastly, should a favorable chance present itself, to give her a raking broadside, close with and carry her by boarding. Ro- derigo having arranged signals and fully ex- plained them and his wishes to Roberto, the latter repaired on board his vessel, while the other two officers. prepared themselves for the encounter. This done, they ascended the deck, and Roderigo calling the men aft, told them the stranger in sight was a lritish  frigate, that he wished to carry her as speed- I ily as possible. "And now lads, to your quarters;. and be lively with your weapons  when you get the world." "Aye, aye, sir!" responded the tars, as  they joyfully rushed to their stations, leaving Oakum standing alone, who, doffing his tar-  paulin,-a lvanced to Roderigo:-  "An so be, an your honor pleases, I should Y like the command of one of them ere bow- c guns, for Bill Oakuim is no lubber at a gun, and I'm thinking that with a mouthful of a grapes, I could make some havoc with the r enemy's running rigging, an your honor t should wih to reduce his sail."    a "Well, Bill, I see you want to make your- self useful, so take your choice of the bow- f guns, and let's see what you can do with the h enemy's sheets and halyards.      c The frigate which had sometime before t discovered the approach, of the two' ves-  eels. and had hauled her wind. was nowm ra- eidly working up to them ; and as she near- n ed, fired a gun to leeward, while at the same c moment the ensign of Great Britain floated o on the wind at her peak, and at the next in- d stant the Star Spangled Banner proudly  threw out its folds from the peak of the Me- c teor. The Isabella now opened her fire with  her larboard waist-guns, the shot from which se overreached without damaging the Ameri- w cans, wno reserved their fire for a more im-v   le mediate proximity. The Isaoella being on e, the larboard tack and about point bianh it range distant, standing to the North East n about three points on the larboard bow of the Meteor, Roderigo ordered Oakum at the lar- I board bow gun, and Tom, who had com- d mand of the long gun amidships, to stand by u and be ready. At this moment the Isabella prepared to tack ship, and as her head came - to the wind the word was given to fire. In - quick succession both pieces belched forth a shower of grape, raking the Isabella from r stem to stern; the enemy's fore and main top-sails came down by the run, and ere this mishap could be righted, the Meteor arid her consort bad crossed her hawse and poured - murderous r ring broadsides into her; then sranging alongside, Roderigo, cutlass in hand, sprang into the rigging calling upon the boarders to follow, and after & short conflict, was in possession of the ship. The slaugh ter on board the Isabella had been terrible- two-thirds of her crew lay dead or severely wounded. The Commander, tendering his sword, said, "may .I be allowed to ask the name of my conqueror?" "I are called Roderigo, and have the honor to command the American privateers Meteor and .Aurora. "What! the noted Roderigo, for whom we have .been cruising for the last two or three months, and who, by common report, is a most cowardly pirate?" "No, sir-allow me to correct you-the individual to whom you refer, and who chose to use my name to cover his butcheries, is called Corregio, alias Hernandez, and coni manded a schooner called the "Saucy Jack,. filled with a crew of lawless cut throats. That individual, I am happy to say, fell by this cutlass 'not many days since, and his vessel and crew perished before my eyes by the explosion of their own magazine." "Thank God for that," said Capt. Smith, "and now, sir, one more question-and then, as I am your prisoner, I am ready to await your pleasure. Will you' allow me to in. quire," said he, with a half serious look, "how my Lord Peterborough's health is about this time? la! ha! ha! a devilish neat trick that,-Capt. Roderigo, but say no- thing about it on shore, or I shall be broke at once." Roderigo assured him he might feel satis- fied the affair would never be mentioned by him, and hoped that Capt. Smith would ex- cuse the slight deception which, under the then existing circumstances, he had felt obliged to use. The wounded having been carefuliy re- moved and 'their wounds dressed, the decks cleared of the dead, and the. prisoners sec cured, all hands were employed in repairing damages on board the three-vessels. This work was speedily accomplished, and to crown the good fortune of the captors, the Isabella had on board a hundred and ffty seamen oelonging to an American privateer which she had taken and su:ik the day pro vious. ?   &11 things being now in, proper train, and the three vessels again in fighting condition, Roderigo having proportiotabl divided his crews-transferring Roberto to the command of the Meteor, and Carlos to the brig--and advanced from the crew of the Meteor a suf- 1cient number ,f .re most worthy to officer the ship, now removed Elizabeth, (whom he had sought at the earliest moment to relieve her anxiety,) with her effetcts and his own on board the Isabella, which was now the flag- ship of his little squadron. After assembling Roberto and Carlos, with his own officers in the cabin of the Isabella, he informed them that he momentarily ex- pected to see the British frigates Fredonia and Britannia, "as," said he, "we are now in the latitude in which they agreed to meet about this time. Now, my friends, what say you? do you think we are strong-handed enough, and are you willing to try them both at once?" With one mind they informed their com- mander that they were not only willing and ready for the conflict, but also believed they were fully a match for them. "Well, then, my good friends, I'll promise you plenty of work-so please to see that everything is in apple-pie order." Having entered into full details of his plan of attack, and arranged all the necessary preliminaries. Roberto and Carlos took their leave and re- paired on board their several vessels. The heet under easy sail then stood on their course.  CHAPTER   XXVI, The following morning about seven bells, "Sail Oh!" re-sounded aloft, and in answer to the usual inquiries, the look-out reported, "under. the lee bow, and standing for us- seems to be a cruiser, sir, by the cut' of his ,sails." -Roderigo having 'ascended the rigging and satisfied himself it was the Britannia, now quickly made his descent, mustered his men to quarters and set signals for Roberto and Carlos to close up in his wake and prepare for immediate action. Informing Elizabeth Qf the necessity of her once more seeking safety, he conducted her to the least exposed part of the ship, and was in a few moments again prepared for the deadly strife. The 'ritannia was now fast approaching them with flowing sheet and heading North-Wes- terly, while Roderigo's fleet, with a fresh North-West breeze were standing along un- der easy sail to the South. Ere, however. the/Britannia had approached within point- blank-range, she was taken aback with the N9rth-Wester. Changing her course and standing Easterly, she tacked and stood to the Westward, with her-ensign flying at her peak. So confident were they on board the Britannia that they were'in the presence of ,he Isabella, and she still under the command of Capt. Smith, that her drams had not yet twat to quarters. It, was during this last evolution of tacking Wheu as the Britannia'l head cane ':p into   Ithe wind, presenting her bows to the open broadside of the Isabella within half point blank-range, Roderigo poured into her a de- structive fire of grape, raking her from stem to stern, Capt. Thompson then discovered his mistake and saw for the first time the Star-Spangled banner dying at the peaks of the little fleet. The men were quickly mus- tered, and the fight kept up with much ob- stinacy, but, crippled as he had been by the first murderous discharge, Capt. Thompson, on Roderigo's ranging alongside and pouring. his crew on board was obliged to surrender -and to his astonishment delivered his sword to the very Roderigo he supposed he had been so long in search of. The matter. however, was britfly explained to him, and he felt less the misfortune of war when he ascertained that his victor had rid the ocean forever of that notorious scourge and his band of demons. Hastily clearing the decks of the dead, and with care of the wounded, and securing the prisoners, all hands were now busily engaged in repairing damages, and in- little more than an hour from the close of the action, the squadron, increased by the Britannia, were once more standing to the Southward under easy sail-with .Ro- berto in command of the Britannia, Carlos of the Meteor, and Jack Trysail of the Brig, with a new division of the crew, the Isabella still remaining the flag-ship, and the whole under command of Roderigo. These arrangements had hardly been com- pleted when a sail was reported from the mast head, on the starboard-beanm, standing for them. Roderigo having examined the stranger and ascertained her to be the Fre- donia, bore up for her. Well knowing that Lord Dash would be-easily decoyed. he drew him down within reach of his guns; the, setting the American Ensign and firingi'a gun to leeward for him to surrender, was an- swered by a broadside which slightly wound- ed two men on board the Isabella, but other- wise passed harmlessly by her. Seeing that it was the determination of Lord Dash to have a fight, Roderigo led the attack with ordering the Britannia to cross thre enemy's hawse and rake him if possible. This being, done in a seaman-like manner, Roderigo bore down upon his starboard' quarter at the same moment that Roberto. struck him on the larboard-beam, and in a few moments his flag was struck and the Fredonid becarme a prize to Roderigo's fleet. The wounded be, ing properly provided for, and the prisoners secured, damages, repaired, and the necessary duties subsequent to an action and victory discharged, Carlos being put in command of the Fredonia, Trysail of the Meteor, and Tom Starboard of the Brig, the squadron stood foi the American coast with a good stifl breeze (the wind having hauled round South East. aqd arrived aftr a fine run of ten days ih Hampton Roads, the day before peace wa? declared. As the fleet came into the Road and sd ood for Norfolk, the inhabitants eo that good little borough were thrown into a state of the most feverish excitement; re,     ports flying from mouth to mouth that it was a British fleet and that the place would be sacked and burnt to cinders. This excite- ment was not a little increased by the au- thorities of the town, who, getting wind of the fact that the American Ensign was dis- played over the British at the peaks of the supposed hostile ships, caused all tne church bells to ring a merry peal. So important an event, however, could not long reman un- known, but on the contrary, spread like wild- fire; and those who but a moment before were running from the Point, now, with ra- pid steps, retraced their steps, and Water and Main streets were crowded with joyous faces eager to get a view of the approaching ves- sels passing the Capes. Roderigo, with Elizabeth, again returned on board his favorite Meteor-and hoisting  at his fore his own broad pennant (well 1 know in the States) with the motto "Free,  as air," and the glorious Star-Spangled ban-  ner floating proudly at his peak, over the h fag of his enemy, he took the lead followed by the three frigates and the brig--the Me- i teor all a-taunt-o, gliding through the water I like a thing of life.  The moment the people on shore recog- I aized Roderigo's flag, they made the welkin t ring with cheers that bounded from swelling c hearts, which cheers were quickly responded p to by the brave tars of the fleet. Forming in s a crescent; the several vessels let go their e anchors; while the nimble crews sprang w aloft, laid out on the yards and speedily furl- iD ed the canvas. Quickly the river was dot- ted with boats and barges of every size, from ri tfe clumsy yawl to the beautiful pinnace, d passing to and from the fleet: officers of gr every grade of Army and Navy, landsmen of to every profession from the highest function- ul ary to the humblest citizen, all eagerly st crowded round the ships to hear the particu- of lars. Having made arrangements for the   sh security of his prisoners, Roderigo surrended ur the prizes into the hands of Commodore - to of that station, who carhe on, board to tender a his services and offer his congratulations- iM and then leaving Roberto in charge of the re Meteor, he handed Elizabeth into his barge and stepping in himself, landed at the foot ci of Main street and look up his quarters at a inr private boarding-house in the vicinity, kept m by Mrs. M.               t On the following morning the glorious da news of peace was proclaimed, and every heart welcomed the tidings with joy; but sel perhaps to no one were they more welcome an( than to Elizabeth, who now joyously look- we ed forward to the return of herself alnd Ro- th derigo to their native land. To add to her rec measure of joy, Roderigo who had been out the a short tin?, now returned with an English ho; paper in his hand; his open, manly counte- ful nance lit up with inward joy, and betraying  to Elizabeth the knowledge of some event re- which particularly interest her.  "Tell me, Alfonso, what cheering news is b contained in that paper, wh sch, I perceivewh 4v your countenance, interests me?"  per   "as  "Why," returt ed Roderigo, f it seems by be an arrival at Por'mouth, the unfortunate ti- Conrad was fallen in lwith soon after Hernan- u- dez left her, and--" of  "M y father-my beloved parent was sar- is- ed!" exclaimed ElizaLeth, as she caught the he arm of her friend, and with straining eyes :h seemed to penetrate his very soul-"Say, in nAlfonso, is it not so? O! I see it is! Y, n- would not thus cruelly torture me with a d- only to blast it."         i re  "Come, Elizabeth, be composed and seat a- yourself, while I tell you all about it." d  With her eyes filled with tears, but tears 2s that glistened with joy, she obeyed; and s- Roderigo proceeded to inform her, in a guarded way, that the Conrad had been vis- d ited but a very short time after the pirate g had left her, and that her father and one "other were found alive and brought to Eng-' eN land, when her parent's wounds soon healed - though he remained in the deepest melan e fcholy from the loss of his child. d  "Blessed be God for his goodness to us! - aid Elizabeth, "and for restoring to me my r loved, revered father-and now, Alfonso, since there exists no bar to your return to - England, what say you for a speedy depar ture. When once arrived. I promise to be- r come your wife without delay. Fear not my parent's objection to the union, for I can as sure you that you had his warmest affection even before your last daring rescue of my un- worthy self, which, I promise you. will not in the least abate his love." Roderigo replied that, akhougn on his ar. rival at Norfolk he had felt that any longee delay of their union would be a source o great unhappiness to him and had intendei to use all his powers of argument to prevail upon her to become his wife immediately, still when he saw the joyful announcement ,of the restoration of her parent, h e thought she might wish that parent to bless their union by his presence and resolving to yield to her wishes and forego his own happiness a while longer, he had been on board the Meteor and ordered Roberto to have her ready for sea at the earliest moment. I thank you from my soul for thus anti cipating my wishes, and hope a life of untir- ing endeavors to promote your happiness, may be crowned with success, as a small re- turn for your unceasing kindness, and the dangers you have braved for me." As our readers may wall imagine for them selves the round of feastings: merry-makings and congratulations, and the attentions that were showered on our hero and heroine on their arrival, we will not tire them with the recital-merely remarking, eiz passant, that they were among Virginians, and Virginian hospitality with its winning sincerity was fully extended to them. In a weeks' time after leaving her, they re-embarked on board the beautiful Meteor which stood down the harbor with a fa ora- bJe breeze, accompanied bythe prayers of the whole population for their speedy and pros- perous voyage and everlasting happiness   sme squadron giving her a Commodore's sa- lute, while from the thickly studded yaids and rigging came forth the hearty cheers of the brave tars. Rounding to and manning his yards, Roderigo responded to the coni- pliment, then filling away took leave of his kind friends. Leaving now the Meteor with the many happy hearts on board her, as wafted by prosperous gales she wends her way for Old England, we will, by the readers permission, change the scent to Dover, and approach yonder happy group of friends, seated beneath the cooling shade of stately oaks, witnessing with smiling faces the gambols and frolics of three beautiful children as they scamper over the wide-spread velvety lawn. There is our old friend Admiral De Lane. whose weather beaten features are covered with the &fag of good -humor and kindness. There is Fitz-Albert, and beside him the beautiful Maria, now in the full possession of her health and mental faculties, is with her hus- band gazing with deep delight on their hap- py boy. Count Montmorency is among the group-his chastened smile bespeaking the corroding sorrow still upon his heart. There also are Cassel and his Henrietta; Hardy and his Helen; with the aged and worthy couple .Mr. and Mrs. Fitz-Albert, whose countenances exhibit the deep emotion of their happy hearts. The morning bright and beautiful, the air tilled with song and fragrance, temptingly in- vite them to a promenade, and they sally forth, Hardy and Helen, as usual leading the way to the'Clifts, their favorite resort, where with a glass they watch forhours the vari-, ous sails 'on the waters beneath them. "That is a beautiful craft," said Hardy; as he raised his glass to scrutinize a vessel distant only some half-dozen miles and ap- proaching the Straits with a fresh and favor- able breeze. "She is indeed," said the Admiral, and must be a foreignerby herrig. 'How gallant- ly she sits the water!" "Ah!" exclaimed Count Montmorency, as the vessel had now rapidly neared, "I think I have seen that craft before. Will you fa- vor me with your glass for a moment, Mr. Hardy,"-and raising the instrument to his eye, "It is he-T cannot he mistaken--[see him-It is Rodt,'igo!" "Roderigo!" exclaimed the group in as- tonishment. "Yes, and there is a lady standing beside him-she, is turning her head this way. Gracious God! it is my child!" and over- powered with his emotion, he dropped the glass and sank to the ground. We confess our utter inability to describe the scene that ensued' on the landing of Ro- derige and Elizabeth-as parent and child- brother and sister, so long mourned as dead, each by the other, now heart to heart in speechless embrace gave utterance to their joy in floods of tears; nor the ill-suppressed sbs and the rebellious tear-drops of the old ;Admiral as in Gon-,la he found his long lost   * son, arid in Roberto, the son of a b .oved de 3 ceased brother; nor of the agreeable surprise f of Roderigo, Hardy and Cassel, who reccg- nized each other as former messmates and brother officers; leaving this to the imagi- nation of all who have thus far been inte- rested in their various histories-being well convinced that their own experience or ob- servation will suggest to their minds what it is impossible for' words to embody-the depth of'happiness those closely-knit hearts realized at that meeting. And in conclusion we state, that soon aftes their arrival, Roderigo led the happy Eliza- beth to the altar, where, in the presence of their valued friends, and a numerous assem- blage-of well-wishers they were united, and took up their abode in the vicinity, on a splendid estate which Roderigo had pur- chased, he being now restored to the title of Sir Robert Wallace-that on the voyage homeward he had stopped with Oakum at the pirate's rendezvous, whence a large amount of specie and valuables were trans- ferred to the Meteors leaving with Oakliim who at his own request was landed at Port Paix, St. Domingo, a bare sufficiency to pay his expenses (he positively refusing any more) till he could reach a monastry where hle intended by a life of penitance and self-de- nial in some degree to atone for the many crimes he had committed-that soon after the arrival of the Meteor, Roderigo delivered over the property (with a list of the vessels robbed by Hernandez which Oakum gave him)' to a committee of underwriters appoint- ed at his request for that purpose-that Government in consideration of his services in ridding Lhe world of such a!nest of lawless freebooters, and the underwriters, in conse- quence of the vast amount of property re- stored through his instrumentality, voted him a large pecuniary reward which he transferred to his brave tars and with which they (abandoning their profession) purchased farms in the neighborhood, forming a village by themselves which they called Metoria- that Gonzala was restored' to his parent by Roberto (now Charles de Lane) who picked up the little fellow at the entrance of the Straits, where he had been cruelly exposed in an open boat by his hard-hearted kidnappers and repaired with him on toard the Meteor, then lying at Gibraltar-tnat Chares sooa found among the many beautiful girls -at Dover one whom he led to the altar and made' his wife, and with whom he occupied a neat estate, adjoining Sir Roberts-that the Aa- miral came and dropped anchor among them, declaring that his son Gonzala should be, in due time, spliced to the daughter of Helen or Henrietta, and that the entire fleet should re- main at their moorings so long as the ground tackle held good-and, finally, that the METEOR, which was now converted into a pleasure yatch, as she sat her native ele- ment, seemed in her noble and gallant bear ing proudly conscious of the instrumentality she had had in bringing about this happy F.

This splendid novel has not a very attractive title, but what it lacks in name it more than makes up in thrilling plot and incident. We hardly know how to praise this novel toe much. Pierce Egan has written many books of fiction, and they have all achieved popularity that may not inappropriately be termed unbounded; but we doubt if he has heretofore penned a novel that will sur- pass-in attractive qualities, the one that bears the title at the head of this paragraph.

To which is appended a Treatise on the Doctrine of Chances, and. numerous decisions oi disputed points. This work is designed to be an American authority for all the various games of skill an4 onance. It hlas been prepared with glreat care by the Editor, with the assistance of a number of gentlemen players of skill and ability, and is not a re-hash of English games, but a live American book, expressly pre- pared for American readers.  The following extract is taken from a lengthy notice in Wilkes' Spirit of the Times: "We have read ' TIrE AMERICAN HOYE ' with care, and can strongly recommend it as a very useful bool to those who enggae in games of cards, dominoes, backgammon, ana the like. It ought to be in every club. room, and in every place where parties meet for their evening game. The long nights of the winter season -re now at hand, and these games will be often resorted to, to while a few hours away. Though mostly played only for amusement, they shouid always be played correctly ; and Aisputes arising over them vLhen no money is at stake are often quite as bitter and acrimohouls as when there is. Therefore this book shouldl be at hand to eettle such cases as they arise. lMoreover, the rules laid down to guide the player so as to make him play the game scientifically are very interesting and valuable, even to those who are well versed in the subject. To a beginner they will be invalui)le. 'The rules we now allude to arc not thd laws of the game, but the rules and deductions of the best players given to form a method of successful play. After having laid down l the principles and laws of each. game, 'The American Hoyle' goes on to give the rules which the player should follow, under the laws aforesaid, to discomfit his adversary and win for himself. As a matter of course, the application of these rules is and must be mainly left to the judgment of the player. The laws of the game are fixed and immutable ;; the rules of play often require to be varied and relaxed according to circum- stances. But to be a good player a man should kInow these philosophical general rules of play. He may be a good player without ever having nmastered the scientific theory of the game, but it is a hundred to one that he never will. We recommend the purchase of this book to all players-proficients and beginners alike." * THE AMiERICAeS IloYt contains over 500 pages, is printed on fine white paper, bound in cloth, with extra gilt side and back, and is profusely illustrated with engravings explainin g the different games.

Also, how to describe a piece of land in deeding it. Also, givlng information as to acquiring and locating a farm on the public lands of the United States. By B. H. DAY. This Ready-Reckoner ia composed of original tables, which are positively correct, having been revised in the most careful manner. The table of aggregate values of merchandise or produce by the pieor pound, ytrdt, foot, inch, gallon, quart, pint, peck, or bushel, from one-eighth up to C10 cents, bringing in atl necessary fractions. This set of tables is very complete for reckoning the aggregate values of articles priced at almost any fracticnal part of a dollar, and is of course applicable to articles of any price whatever, over a dollar., It is perfect in this respect. The second set of tables'give the value by the ounce of articles sold by the pdund, from two cents per pound, cent by cent, up to one dollar per pound. The tables of wages by the week, Ehowing the wages from one-fourth day up to four weeks. The rates of wages begin at twenty-five cents, and gradually rise up to twenty dollars per week. Tables of wages by the month, show the wages pe. day, and for any number of days in the month, from one dollar up to one hundred dollars per month. Tablce of salaries by the year show the amount of the salary for one day, and for any number of days tip to one month, beginning at twenty dollars, and rising gradually up to fifteen hundred dollars a year. Tables ol boar d by the week give the -board for one day, increasig one day at a time up to four weeks; then the boara foyr thi, ty days and for 31 days, at rates from one dollar, increasing gradually up to fifty dollars per week, Trhe interest tables show the rates at five, six, seven and eight per cent. on any amount, from one day up to one year. Then come the board, plank, and timber tables, showing the contents of boards, planks, round logs, and other timber. Also, the wood and land measurements. These tables arc all prefaced by explana- tions telling exactly how to make the measurements, and giving easily understood examples, so that any peason can measure for himself, if he don't want to uso the tables, or distrusts them. This is, indeed, the most simple and easily understood Ready-Reckoner ever printed. Most books of this kind are hard to un- derstand, and that is why we wanted to print one with explanations how the reckoning should be done.
