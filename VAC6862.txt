                  CHAPTER I. 
                  THE GUARD-HOUSE. 
                  IT was late one evening, not long after the British army had taken possession of New York, in the year 1776, that a young man passing the guard house near the English General's quarters, was abruptly hailed by the sentry:- 
                  'Who goes? king's man or rebel?' 
                  'Rebel, if the word likes you,' answered the young man haughtily; and as he came opposite the door of the guard-house, the light shining out upon him, showed that he was dressed in a blue surtout, with a black glazed belt buckled about his waist, holding a brace of serviceable looking pistols and a stout sabre with an iron hilt. The rest of his costume was that of a civilian of the day; viz., small clothes with sparkling buckles at the knee, and a cocked hat looped up with black cord. His features were bold and expressive, with dark eyes and raven black hair. 
                  There were seated on benches within the guard-house door the sergeant and two or three grenadiers smoking, while along the sides of the room in the rear were indistinctly visible the dark forms of others sleeping on cots ranged against the wall. 
                  The street was quite dark and deserted, for the hour was late, and the fear of their conquerors caused all citizens to shut up their houses early and put out any light that might attract straggling patrols and induce them to enter; though to the praise of the English general, it ought to be said that the enemy on taking possession of the city had yet acted with forbearance and deference towards citizens of whatever political complexion; but this praise, we are also bound to add, was not long merited. 
                  Strict military discipline was enforced over the town as soon as it fell into the hands of the English General, and after night-fall any person appearing in the streets was challenged, and arrested and lodged in the guard-house if found without a pass signed at head-quarters. 
                  'So, this is an answer to give one of his majesty's royal grenadiers,' cried the soldier presenting his piece. 'Advance and surrender yourself or you are shot down." 
                  'You should challenge more civilly if you expect a civil reply,' answered the young provincial firmly, and at the same time approaching the guardhouse door he placed in the hand of the sentry a small piece of paper very much crumpled. The man took it with a growl; 
                  'What right have rebels to have passes to go loose about the town, breeding all manner of mischief, while we poor devils couldn't get leave of absence to go to the next ale-house corner?' 
                  'Hist, Ramsell,' said the old grey headed sergeant, rising and taking from him the paper which he was in vain trying to make out. 'Hush, don't you see he is a gentleman!' 
                  'I never saw a rebel that was a gentleman,' answered the grenadier Ramsell gruffly; but fixing his eyes more closely upon the stranger, he lowered his tone to one more respectful, when he met his piercing overpowering look, and added, 'The general knows though who to trust, I suppose. Is it right, sergeant? 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              "Yes, all right! It reads, Permit the bearer to pass and repass through the streets at his own discretion. 
                              
                                 (Signed) CUYLER, Aid de Camp.
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  'It is all right, sir,' said the sentry. 'Pass.' 
                  The young man took the paper again, and 
                        thursting
                        thrusting
                      it into his belt as if for ready use, went on his way. 
                  'But one minute more, serjeant, and that rebel young gentleman would have had a bullet through him,' said the grenadier as he rested his musket upon his foot, and leaning upon it with his hand, he listened to his retiring footstep. 
                  'You must not challenge in that style man,' said the sergeant in a severe tone; 'the ale you have been drinking is in your brain. If it had been one of our officers you would have been censured if not more.' 
                  'I knew it was not an Englishman's step. I saw plain enough he wasn't in uniform before I challenged! St. George but his answer rung! He was well armed to! What can his lordship mean by letting the rebel officers go about this way?' 
                  'You are not sure he is an officer are ye?' inquired a small man with a fat belly and cheeks that looked well filled with good ale, who made his appearance from the darker recesses of the guard house, holding in his arms full a round dozen of empty quart pots; 'you are not sure he is an officer, be ye, sentinel?' 
                  'Don't talk, Jimmy Newcomb,' said the sergeant pleasantly; 'go you to your ale-house with your empty mugs, and see you have them all well replenished ished, and here again the time we release guard! What can a man who spends all his days in a pot-house know of warlike affairs. Go, Jemmy, or an officer may catch you here, and then you will repent lagging to talk with grenadiers!" 
                  'Yes, but I was saying,' persevered the little ale-house man, who kept the Blue Star Inn at the foot of the next alley, a place of celebrity in its day, 'I did but say you were not sure he is an officer.' 
                  'Yes, we all heard that, Jemmy,' answered Ramsell. 'Do you know he isn't?' 
                  'Well, that is telling, gentlemen,' answered little Jemmy Newcomb shaking his head, and looking very mysterious. 'If I was a mind to I could say something!' 
                  'Well out with it, out with it, little man,' said the tall grenadiers bending towards him. 
                  'Well I should say,' said the ale-house keeper, lowering his voice, 'I should say he was a very dangerous person to have a passport. I guess Genril Howe didn't know who he was givin' it to!' 
                  'Why didn't you let me know before he went on?' thundered the grenadier with a look of displeasure that nearly annihilated the little man. 
                  ''Coz I was afeard he'd see me, so I kep' back!' 
                  'Who is he?' demanded the sergeant. 
                  'Well I don't know exactly his name. But I know he has done a deal o' fighting against the Bostonians, and he was the same one as took that British colonel and his friends, prisoners up to White Plains when they was eatin' dinner! 
                  'Yes, we heard of that,' said the sergeant jumping up; 'he had only seven men with him: and entering the house took a colonel, and captain and some sixteen tory gentlemen prisoners! If I had known he had part in that affair I would not have let him pass if he had shown me twenty 
                        pasports
                        passports
                     ? The general can't know his man!' 
                  'It is the same young man that commanded the party that drove the English from the fort this side of Harlem and-' 
                  'Why the devil didn't you let us know it, you infernal pot-house keeper,' cried one of the grenadiers, a fellow with a huge beard and gigantic voice to whose bayonet-belt Jemmy scarcely came up; and taking him by the cape of his jacket he lifted him bodily from the floor and shook him till the tankards flew from his terrified grasp and came rattling down upon the floor with a terrible clatter, that awaked the whole guard-house. 
                  'Don't hurt the man, Geddes,' said the sergeant. 
                  'No, let him down,' cried the others laughing at his terror, and dancing arms and legs; 'we must have ale, and if Jemmy Newcomb be slain what will we do for a foaming tankard when we are dry! We had not been more than four and twenty hours in the town, when Jemmy became our right hand man! He first brought us his ale and bade us drink without pay! What can be done without him! Let him live?' 
                  'Yes, gentlemen, yes, the honest grenadier speaks truly and wisely,' cried Jemmy piteously, while the giant with malicious pleasure still held him suspended at arm's length, his feet full a yard from the floor; 'what would you do without Jemmy Newcomb? Didn't I come here as soon as you got into quarters and proffered ye ale without charge?' 
                  'That is true, Jemmy,' was the response of the giant, on whose face the ale-man's eyes rested pleadingly as he spoke. 'Go on, boy.' 
                  'Didn't I drink to his majesty's health too, when you bid me, so as to see if I wasn't a rebel?' continued Jemmy, with tears in his little gray eyes. 
                  'That's as true as if the general himself said it,' again answered the grenadier with the huge moustache and huge voice. 
                  'Didn't I-, augh!-buh!-chu!-' 
                  'Let the little bladderkin down, Geddes,' cried several voices; 'don't you see he is strangling. We can't spare him. Let him down!' 
                  The grenadier complied and let him touch the floor, where for a moment the little fellow sunk exhausted. But recovering himself he began to pick up his tankards, in which task, some of the more good-natured soldiers helped him. 
                  'He, hee! a good joke wasn't it, Geddes,' said the little man, as he crept, limping about them; 'you are a powerful strong man you be, but you was most too much for me that time, wasn't you? He, hee, hee!' 
                  'Poor fellow, he tries to laugh it off,' said one of the men! 'Don't be afraid to come again, Jemmy, you shall not be troubled any more!' 
                  'Not I. I an't afraid! Geddes and I are good friends. I don't fear him, not I. When he comes over to the tap I'll give him a fresh tankard for love's sake, that I will!' 
                  'What a forgiving little devil it is,' said Ramsell. 
                  At the moment he was speaking, with his back turned to the street, a hand was laid upon his musket, and a stern voice said, 
                  'Sergeant, place this sentry under arrest! Is this the way a British sentry performs his duty? I am not your 
                        commading
                        commanding
                      officer, but I do what he would do!' 
                  Ramsell, interested in what was passing within, had been completely taken by surprise. His first impulse was to turn upon him: but when he saw his face he hung his head, and gave his musket up to the sergeant. 
                  The person who had surprised him was a man about the age of thirty years, and of a noble, military presence. He was wrapped in a blue cavalry cloak and was unattended. 
                  'Sergeant,' he said, with stern displeasure, 'although we are not in a field with enemies in front, we are in a city filled with enemies, and to be on the alert is as needful as if we expected an assault. You must have better order in the guardhouse, sir Captain-of-the-guard. Place a man you can depend on in this negligent fellow's place. Has any one passed within the last quarter of an hour, sirrah?' he demanded of the discomfited sentinel. 
                  'Yes, sir,' answered the sargeant; 'it was a young man in citizen's dress, and who carried a pass.' 
                   
                  'Was he dressed in blue, and did he wear a black belt with pistols and sabre thrust into it?' 
                  'Yes, Colonel Tuncoe, he did.' 
                  'A pass had he?' demanded the cavalry officer with surprise. 
                  'Yes, sir.' 
                  'In what name?' 
                  'It was only "the bearer." It was regularly signed by lord Howe's Aid-de-Camp, Major Cuyler.' 
                  The commander of the Queen's Ranger Hussars remained thoughtful a moment or two, during which interval Jemmy the ale-man succeeded in effecting his escape with his tankards by creeping noiselessly underneath the Sergeant's arm. 
                  'Should he return this way arrest him, Sergeant, but see that you entreat him with due respect; and immediately send word to the general-in-chief.' 
                  'It shall be done, sir,' answered the sergeant. 
                  The English cavalry-officer then gathered his cloak over his breast, slightly bowed his head, and leaving the door of the guard station, passed rapidly onward in the direction which the young Provincial had taken more than a quarter of an hour before. 
                  We will follow the young American. After quitting the guard house, he walked steadily with the firm tread of one familiar with the unlighted street he was traversing. It wound along towards the left to accommodate itself to a sort of ravine which at that time made up among the houses from the harbor, penetrating nearly to Wall street. 
                  He crossed this canal by an old bridge constructed of Dutch brick, and nearly fallen to decay, and after passing through a narrow lane, he entered Pearl street, then the 'Beacon street' of the city. It was bordered by trees whose dark shadows made the darkness upon the sidewalk impenetrable. After passing two or three handsome mansions, from the parlour windows of which lights brightly shone out, for the residents were Tories, and were entertaining British officers, he abruptly crossed the street to a large house that reared its dark, unilluminated front above a group of catalpa trees. This dwelling was one of the stateliest in the town, and from a balcony on its rear an unobstructed view was obtained by day of the East River for many a mile towards the Sound; and from its roof was visible the noble panorama of New York bay. 
                  The young man on reaching the gateway paused an instant, and then, as if satisfied he was not observed by any one, he passed up the free stone steps and turning aside before reaching the portico he entered a gravelled pathway that led around the mansion. The walk though narrow, he trod in the darkness with perfect security of step, though his dress and even his chapeau would often catch a stray tendril, or slender branch, that heavy with dew, bent across his way. As he passed round the south side of the dwelling, his step slackened to one of more care and watchfulness; and in this wary way he reached the lower balcony and laid his hand upon it. 
                  As he did so the Trinity clock tolled nine. The voice of sentry responded to sentry along the guarded streets; and, from the ships of war in the harbor, came landward on the south wind the musically sounding bells of the seamen's watch, tolling the passing of time, forecastle to forecastle answering back. 
                  'Isabel,' said he in a low tone. 
                  He could see no one; for the balcony was perfectly dark, shaded by trellised vines that festooned themselves from column to column, forming a close and verdant curtain around the balustrade. 
                  'Logan?' answered, as if inquiringly, a low sweet-toned voice from a window that opened upon the balcony. 
                  He replied by lightly springing from the ground upon the floor of the balcony and approaching the window. It was a Venetian window extending from the ceiling to the floor, serving for the purpose of a door when its leaves were thrown open. The lower leaves were now closed, and over them bent the form of a young girl, indistinctly and with a sort of vision-like outline, relieved against a shaded and almost obscured lamp hidden from sight in the green bosom of a group of flower-vases. From their dark polished leaves was reflected, with a subdued tone, the only light that revealed, like things seen in dreams, the objects in the apartment. The features could not even be seen, only the dark shadows of her eyes deep in which played the lambent, gentle light that outshone from her soul. 
                  The maiden was Isabel Rivingstone. She was the only daughter of a gentleman of fortune and family who was allied by blood to the noblest names in England. He had visited the Colony when a young man as secretary to one of his majesty's Governors: and forming a matrimonial alliance with a distinguished Colonial family, he became from choice a permanent resident out of England. He had a son, the hero who gives a name to our story, and a daughter Isabel, both born upon his estate upon the Hudson. 
                  When the struggle for independence began, Mr. Rivingstone, from both education and prejudice, gave his sympathies with the mother country. He had educated both his children to venerate in the highest degree, England and its institutions. Schuyler Rivingstone, however, after the war commenced, examining the two sides of the question of quarrel with an impartial and intelligent mind, and, convinced of the justice of the cause of the colonies, did not hesitate openly to avow his opinions. His sister Isabel, on the contrary, was a rank Tory, and did all she could, so far as love and affection, aided by ridicule and raillery could do, to bring him over to her own sense of the rights of royalty. Schuyler, however, was not to be wrongly persuaded even by sisterly love and eloquence, but that 'these colonies were, and of a right ought to be free and independent states!' Isabel finding her zeal for his conversion to Toryism thrown away, at length gave up the task, and so long as he had not openly espoused the rebel-cause by actually taking up arms, she felt less keenly his want of due loyalty to the crown. 
                  The triumph of Isabel on the entrance of the British in New York was only exceeded by the chagrin felt by Schuyler at this untoward commencement of the great struggle for political freedom. 
                   
                  Mr. Rivingstone had already begun to speak of a dinner to the conquering General and his staff, and Isabel to look forward to presiding with joyous anticipations. 
                  But Tory as the maiden was, truth to tell, she had a Whig lover! This was none other than Logan McLeod, the young man whom we have followed to the balcony. But Logan was her lover before the war broke out, and before occasion was given for every young man to declare his political feelings. Logan was descended from a Scotch baronet, who, in '45 had left Scotland for the colonies where his family had got to be one of the principal in the Province. Logan was an only son, his mother was a widow, and he possessed a large patrimony in the Highlands of the Hudson. When the colonists took up arms he declared boldly for the cause of his native land; and as a volunteer, had already eminently distinguished himself by several daring acts worthy of the days of chivalry. The possession of the metropolis by the invaders of the land filled him with bitterness and shame; yet far from being dispirited by the event, he trusted in the power of the spirit of liberty, which had arisen in its majesty throughout the length and breadth of the land, and looked forward to the period when the last footstep of the British invader should be obliterated from the soil and his country be free! 
                  'You are punctual, Logan to your hour,' said Isabel Rivingstone as she returned the pressure of the hand he laid gently upon hers. 'Now what great news bring you for my ears? From your note which I got as I was leaving the tea-table I am led to expect to hear at least that Mr. Washington has been captured and the rebels have thrown down their arms! If so, sir, kneel and take before me the oath of allegiance to good king George, and I will make interest with General Howe that your head be left quietly on your shoulders!' 
                  'You are in a mood for raillery to-night, dear Bel,' he replied in a tone half grave, half playful. 'I wrote to ask you to be on the balcony at this hour, not to please your loyal ear with tales of colonial misfortunes, for these have to mine, little to please!' 
                  'You are serious now! I am sorry I have wounded your feelings, Logan. It is a pity that you will not become a loyalist and then we should always have it peace between us!' 
                  'Do, do not ask me, Isabel! even my love for you, is not powerful enough to make me turn a traitor to my country!' 
                  'Traitor?' 
                  'Yes; but let us not speak upon this subject, my dear Isabel? I have sought this interview with you to-night to take leave of you!' 
                  'To take leave of me?' she repeated in a faltering tone; and he felt the hand he enfolded within his, tremble like a little bird suddenly startled. 
                  'Yes, Isabel, I leave New York to-night,' he answered with emotion, yet trying to speak with indifference. 
                  'Where do you go?' 
                  'To serve my country, Isabel,' was the firm response. 
                
                
                   
                  CHAPTER II. 
                  THE FAREWELL. 
                  THE young girl slowly withdrew her hand from the grasp of the young Provincial, when she heard this startling confession, and an exclamation of mingled surprise and pain escaped from her lips. 
                  'Are you speaking truth, Logan?' she asked in an agitated tone. 
                  'Yes, Isabel. What I have spoken is truth. I am here to-night to say farewell to you. I need not, to you, disguise my love for my country. If I loved not that, I could not love you.' 
                  'You certainly will not go away, Logan?' she cried, laying her hand upon his shoulder and looking closely and earnestly into his face, as if she would read in its faintly seen lineaments a contradiction of her fears. 'You do but jest with my love.' 
                  'No, Isabel, I cannot jest while the fate of my country hangs so perilously; nor would I make light of your deep attachment for me-an attachment that it is my pride and joy to return with all my heart.' 
                  'But you will not leave me, Logan?' and her lips rested a moment upon his forehead, as she bent over him. 
                  'I can love no one more devotedly than I love you, dearest Isabel,' he said warmly; 'but, much as I love you, I love my poor, struggling country more. Shall I remain here idle, while the bravest and truest hearts in all the broad land are mailed for the conflict, and every patriot hand that can hold a sword grasps one? Shall I remain here while a host of noble youths have followed Washington to the camp? Shall I ingloriously linger here a slave, a prisoner, scorned and despised in my native city? Can I dwell in the midst of our haughty conquerors and carry in my breast the spirit of a man-of a freeman? No, Isabel,' continued the youth with animation and fire, 'no, dear as you are to me, precious as are your tears, thrilling as your eloquent words may be, they cannot make me forget my bleeding country. Oh, that I could prevail upon you, that I could persuade you, convince you that the cause of this land is the cause of God? Are you not, as well as I, bound to the soil by ties of birth and kindred and sympathy? Are you-' 
                  'But I do not wish to be severed from the soil. It is as dear to me as to you, Logan, every whit,' answered the young girl with spirit. 'I only wish the mild rule of the hundred British kings to sway its destinies, while you would commit them to men of to-day-men who-' 
                  'Say nothing, Isabel, against the noble motives of the leading spirits of this revolution. Never more pure, brave, honest, 
                        dignfiied
                        dignified
                      men trod the earth than the invincible host that constitute our National Congress.' 
                  'It is useless, Logan, for us to speak on this subject,' said the maiden in a tone of sadness; it has already severed the union of families and lovers. Oh, let it not come between your heart and mine, Logan! Tell me you will not depart from the city. My fears will be constantly alive lest harm befal you. I know your daring spirit, and your deeds already have made me proud of you; I only regret they were performed against Englishmen, your brothers. If you go to the camp of this rebel-chieftain, Mr. Washington-' 
                  'General Washington, Isabel,' interrupted the young man with emphasis. 
                  'Well, General Washington, then, to please you, Logan, inasmuch as the rebels have conferred upon him the office and title of general. If you attach yourself to his camp, you will, ere many days, end a rash career with an ignominious death.' 
                  'If I fall in behalf of my country, then welcome death. I shall lay in the lap of honor.' 
                  'A rebel's death on the battle field can never be an honorable death, if it is this you seek. But, this is too painful to dwell upon,' she cried shrinking and with tremulous accents. 'I forbid your going, Logan. By your love for me, I lay my commands upon you. Remain here in the city. Associate with the British officers; assume your true position as a loyal subject of the British king, whose subjects we are. You can hold rank, and honors, if you will, in the army. Lord Howe will gladly receive you. You will be caressed and honored. I shall then feel a just pride in being named by every lip your affianced bride.' 
                  Enough, Isabel!' he said, gently,-You cannot tempt me! Are you ashamed now, shall you be ashamed by and by to be called the betrothed bride of a Provincial Patriot? Will your cheek burn in presence of the gay British officers and their ladies, to confess your attachment to me? If so, Isabel, let this be our last farewell! Let us be to each other as if we had not grown up together and loved from childhood! Let us teach our hearts to throb with separate pulsations for evermore! I will replace thy image in my breast with that of Liberty! I will love, instead of loving thee, my country! The cause I respect, Isabel Rivingstone, is a noble one! The shield of the God of battle is stretched over our patriotic land! There is not a manly heart on the globe that does not throb for us, and pray for our success! Look at the noble spirits that even monarchies send forth to our aid! Look at the chivalrous Marquis de Lafayette! Look at Baron Steuben! at Pulaski! and others! If I sever my heart strings from clinging to the heart-strings of patriot countrymen, then may my existence be cut off from the face of the earth! 
                  Isabel Rivingstone listened without reply or motion. A strong conflict was going on in her bosom between attachment to the crown on one hand, and love for the noble youth who had thus eloquently stood forth for his oppressed people. 
                  'Isabel!' he added in a milder tone-with gentle entreating cadence in his accents, 'Isabel, be true to yourself! I beg of you! Be an American woman, not a provincial dependent!' 
                  'No, no, Logan? You have said all you can say. I am not convinced. I never can be convinced that this rebellion is just! Oh, do not draw back from me so coldly. Do not let this make us 
                        enemeis
                        enemies
                     ! If we cannot think alike, let us at least be true to each other in the union of our hearts!' 
                  'Nay, Isabel! It is better that we should part now for ever!' he said firmly, but very sadly. 
                  'No-no!' she almost shrieked as she threw herself upon his bosom. 'Do not leave me thus! Alas! this unhappy, unhappy rebellion! Is it destined to send a sword into every family, dividing asunder the best and highest affections! Say, if you must go, that you will return to me!' 
                  'I cannot control the future, dearest Isabel! But be assured, if you cast me not off, for shame that you have a rebel lover, I shall never-' 
                  'These are cruel words, Logan!' she said reproachingly. 
                  'I would not willingly cast a shadow over your heart, Isabel! But I fear you will soon forget me! Be it so! I will then only remember that I have a country to love and defend, instead of her who should have been my bride!' 
                  The maiden buried her face in her hands, and rested them upon his shoulder, while her agitated heart throbbed wildly. 
                  'While I am away,' he continued in a quiet, bitter tone, 'you will think of me as the enemy of your father's haughty guests. I shall think of you as the partner in the waltz, or presiding at the table with the enemies of my country, with the men who have come to enslave us! To-day you dance with the man whom to-morrow I meet face to face in battle.' 
                  'Spare-oh spare me, Logan,' she cried with anguish. 
                  'Away from you I shall not fail to reflect how your courtesy and smiles and hospitality will give confidence to our aggressors! who will not regard as unjust their invasion, when the fairest part of the inhabitants welcome them with entertainments, and throw round their path of oppression, the graces of their presence! Shame on them! Shame, Isabel, when the American woman, who, dazzled by the pomp and blazonry of royalty, can so far forget the land of her birth, as to regard otherwise than with scorn and detestation the glittering minions of a monarch who fain would make the land that God and patriots, will to be free, the footstool of his proud empire, on which if we will acknowledge ourselves serfs, we may be permitted to crawl and lick the dust from the steps of his throne?' 
                  Thus speaking, he drew her tenderly to his heart, pressed a hurried kiss upon her cheek, whispered sadly, 'Farewell, Isabel, I leave you for my country.' The next moment he was gone. 
                  It was several seconds before Isabel Rivingstone could realize that he had left her. She bent forward, and her ear caught his quick retiring tread faintly echoing from a distance. 
                  'Gone, gone! Gone and thus to go!' she cried with anguish! 'Am I indeed unworthy of his manly love? Is the cause he has embraced a sacred one, and am I the base and shameful woman he has pictured me!' 
                  At this moment the door leading from the drawing-room into the hall opened, and a young man entered abruptly. 
                  'Isabel, is it you I hear crying in such accents of woe!' he said, throwing a cloak he carried upon his arm into a chair; and taking the light from the midst of the plants and placing it upon a marble table near, he then approached her. 'Are you ill?' 
                  His voice was affectionate, and his manner sympathising. His air and appearance were those of a gentleman. His age was about four and twenty; but his height was so commanding that he had the aspect of being older. His eye was very black and piercing and his face speaking with intelligence and courage. It was Schuyler Rivingstone, the brother of Isabel. The resemblance between them, however, as the light now revealed her features, was clearly apparent. She had the same stately height, yet gracefully feminine: the same large, open, expressive dark eyes; the same proud carriage and noble air which so unquestionably stamped him by birth a gentleman. 
                  'What has happened! Did I not hear another voice besides your own? I believed it Logan's, and came down to speak to him.' 
                  'It was Logan's voice, brother,' she answered in accents of the deepest grief. 'It is the last time I shall listen to it! He has left me for ever." 
                  'Logan departed? How mean you?' 
                  'He has gone to join Washington in his camp!' 
                  'Is it possible? Why did he not name it to me? I would have gone with him.' 
                  'You too, Schuyler? Will you desert me also?' 
                  'When did he say he was to leave the Island?' 
                  'To-night! He left me in displeasure! Alas, that I should be made thus wretched by this unnatural rebellion of the land! Do I not well to hate a cause that estranges from me such a heart as Logan's.' 
                  'Let your reproaches fall upon our haughty invaders, upon the powerful monarch, not upon the weak Provincial. Have you quarrelled?' 
                  'I know not! Do not question me! He left me saying bitter words that cut me to the heart!' 
                  'I would they could produce upon you the effect they ought, sister! he said solemnly. 'Logan is the very soul of honor, and in his bosom burns purely the fire of patriotism! He could have said to you nothing but what he should have uttered and you have listened to! If you have let him depart rather than prove yourself worthy of being his countrywoman-of being his wife, let the wretchedness fall upon your own heart! I have heard him speak of you with tears of manly regret that you, who were sensible and just-judging in all things else, should be so blinded touching the great question, that like a flail goes through the wheat! How can Logan love truly the maiden who takes side with his enemies? I have wondered at his patience.' 
                  'Do you not love Grace Lee?' 
                  'Grace is no longer a tory! She has, not an hour since, written me a note saying that she has learnt to be and feel as a true American girl should.' 
                  'Did your arguments or her love convince her?' asked Isabel, half-smiling through the tears which her deep grief for Logan's parting farewell had brought into her eyes; tears shed not without a hope, however, that they should yet meet again. She would not suffer herself to believe that hearts so long united could be so suddenly and forever riven apart. She secretly believed she would yet behold him once more ere he left the main-land. 
                  'My arguments and her love combined I trust! I have not seen her yet to inquire of her. I am persuaded that a woman cannot very profoundly love where she thinks differently from her lover on a question like this?' 
                  'Must a female surrender her free will? Must she blindly believe as he does! slavishly adopt his opinions because they are his? 
                  'I will not discuss the point with you, Isabel; for this is a matter of feeling rather than of argument between a lover and his mistress.' 
                  'And Grace Lee has truly become a rebel? asked Isabel with surprise, as if just that moment realizing the fact. 
                  'I am only surprised that she has ever been otherwise, when her father is so warm and prominent a partisan of the rebel-cause, as you are pleased to designate the noblest cause men ever rose up as a nation to maintain by arms. If you truly loved Logan, you would not have suffered him to leave you as he has done. 
                  'I do love him, Schuyler! I live but in the joy of loving him! He is dearer to me than life! But how can I think as he and you would have me, when I in my heart as firmly believe that England is right in trying to subdue her recreant colonies as I believe my creed!' 
                  'Infatuated girl!' cried Rivingstone, taking up his cloak and throwing it about him, 'you are sowing, I fear, great misery for yourself.' 
                  'If I could think differently I would. Neither you nor Logan, eloquent as you have been, have ever convinced me that your cause is not a bad one. Logan's difference of opinion will make me love him no less; but I cannot say I think he is right, when I believe him wrong. If I did so to conciliate him, I should despise myself for my weakness and inconsistency. Dear as he is to me-and God knows how my heart is bound up in its true love for him-dear as his regard and praise are for me-were he to return now and offer me his hand on the condition that I would become a friend to the cause he has espoused, I should firmly refuse, though it were to break my heart.' 
                  'You are a noble, obstinate creature, 'Bel, and while I sorrow for your political errors, I cannot but admire your consistency of character. Logan must respect though he ceases to love.' 
                  'Cease to love! Oh, repeat not such fearful words. I cannot believe that we shall cease to love. I cannot realize that we can be other than we have been. I should go wild did I believe that we were to meet no more. Seek him. Oh, seek him, Schuyler. Bid him return to me, and-' 
                  'What shall I say? Shall I tell him you are no longer the friend of his foes?' 
                  'No no! Would you could honestly. But I would see him again. I would hear him speak one mild word to me. I would have him part differently from me. 
                  'Isabel, you have grieved and bruised his noble heart. You little know how he, with every true American, looks upon the cause to which he is devoting himself. In Logan's eyes it is sacred, and it is irresistible that he should regard its foes with horror, and shrink from contact with those-even from the attractive and beautiful of your sex-even from you, as from the deadliest foe.' 
                  'Will you make me abhor myself? What fearful thing is this that I am guilty of, that I should be thus spoken of by a brother and by a lover? I am almost ready to sacrifice my own judgment and-' 
                  'Judgment must not be sacrificed, but convinced! The cause seeks no unwilling or blind adherents. But I must leave you, Isabel! I have to be absent for an hour. Retire now, and to-morrow I would recommend you thoroughly to examine this great question and fully inform your mind as to the facts. I shall not then fear your decision. You have every inducement to do so! Logan's love and my confidence! 
                  'Where do you go now?' 
                  'I dare not trust you, Isabel,' he answered gravely. 'I am to go out on affairs dear to my heart, for they concern the well-being of my country!' 
                  Having thus spoken and tenderly embraced her, the young man opened the leaves of the Venetian window and passed out. 
                  'Schuyler!' and he felt a trembling hand nervously laid upon his arm. 
                  'Well, sister!' 
                  'Is it possible that Logan will see me no more?' 
                  The thrilling tones of her voice sank into the brother's heart. It told him how powerful was the struggle going on in her bosom between principles and affections. 
                  'Logan has given himself to a cause for which men are daily severing the tenderest ties of heart and household! You must not be surprised, Isabel, that he should love his country more than his country's foes! If you side with them, you should expect him to forget you! I am, also, to sever the close ties that bind me to my home! I am to leave my father and you on the morrow, or next day, perhaps to-night, if I am so fortunate as to fall in with Logan ere he leaves the island! Good night!" 
                  'He gone too,' she said mournfully as his departing footsteps no longer fell on her ear. 'Alas, how wretched am I!-Logan scorns me! My brother withholds his confidence, and both speak so stern and coldly! What fearful crime am I committing in my opinions! All my happiness is threatened with wreck and ruin. To those I love best on earth I am become hateful! Those whose esteem I most covet, despise me, and turn from me as if I were a vile thing! Am I doing such great wrong in taking part with the king? Is this cause, which the noble Logan, which the honorable and true-hearted Schuyler, embrace with such zeal and devotion that it seems a religion with them, is it then just? Can it after all be just? Would they give themselves hand and heart to an unworthy and dishonorable cause? Is the king wrong? Is he a tyrant? Are the ministry wicked? Has England become a nation of oppressors? Which is easiest to believe? 
                  Perplexed. bewildered, and her mind weighed down with grief and painful apprehensions, she retired to bury her torturing thoughts in the sweet oblivion of sleep. 
                
                
                   
                  CHAPTER III. 
                  THE REBEL PRISONER. 
                  WHEN Schuyler Rivingstone left his sister, he took his way across the street on which his house was situated, and passed into a narrow lane, bordered by trees on one side and a low brick wall upon the other. This wall was the remains of what had in former days been the 'wall of the town,' and the lane, what is now known as Wall street. Half way up this lane was a gate which opened into a yard surrounded by barracks, where the Queen's Ranger Hussars were quartered. This was a favorite light corps in the British army, and had that day been placed under the command of a young English Captain of Grenadiers, Simcoe, with the provincial rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. This corps was disciplined for the most active service. Though richly accoutred and finely mounted they never indulged in those idle parades which characterized many other 'crack corps' of the service. They were never to march at slow time; were practised to fire with precaution and steadiness, to use their weapons with force and effect, and to disperse and rally with rapidity. Their chief was a noble specimen of the British soldier. Military deeds were a passion with him. He was a soldier in heart not in art, merely. He was under thirty years of age and of a fine personal appearance. As a man, his birth was high, his fortune large. To conclude, his hatred for 'the rebels' was without limit. He had no sympathy with their cause, and religiously believed that all who were taken prisoners ought to be hanged without mercy. 
                  As Rivingstone came up to the gate he saw on guard duty beneath the arch a mounted hussar. He kept a little to one side underneath the trees as he passed, as if not caring to be recognized. 
                  'Who goes there?' hailed the sentinel, pacing his horse a little forward. 
                  'Howe and York.' 
                  'Pass on!' he answered, reining back to his place with ringing spurs and jingling accoutrements. 
                  Rivingstone walked on, and emerging from the avenue near the dark front of the old Trinity church, he turned to the left, and stopped near a small but tasteful mansion which fronted on the Broad-way and on the river; for at that period the gardens of the houses on the west side of Broad-way descended quite to the waters of the Hudson. The house stood back some yards from the street, and access was had to it by a walk laid through shrubbery. Rivingstone, as if perfectly familiar with the place, entered the dark avenue, and ascending the portico, was about to open the door with the familiar manner of an inmate rather than a guest, when a female who had been concealed by the trellised vine of a jasmine, advanced and spoke. 
                  'Is it you, Grace?' he exclaimed, taking his grasp from the knob of the door and clasping her hand. 
                   
                  'I feared you were not coming! I have been watching for you here for the last half hour.' 
                  'Yet I have not delayed a moment! Your note said half-past nine, and it is scarcely past that time! But your voice falters as you speak and your hand trembles in mine! What has happened?' 
                  'I will soon tell you, Schuyler,' she said with deep emotion. 'Come in with me, for I have much to say!' 
                  'I have not congratulated you on your turning Whig, dear Grace,' he said, smiling, as they passed into the lighted hall together; 'is it this that flutters you, and are you now repenting? When I got your notice that you had become one of us, my heart swelled with deep, deep joy! Did you write to me to have me come and enjoy with you your happy conversion? If so, I need not tell you how happy I am! We can now love, dearest Grace, without alloy! We shall no longer have any difference of opinion touching the merits of this great struggle to mar our peace! Joy to thee and me, dear Grace! Yet, there was a certain energy of expression in your hurried note that led me to think there was something of importance you wished to communicate besides telling me from your own lips that you were 'a true American girl!' Has anything occurred? Something surely has happened; for your cheek is deadly pale, now I can see it by the light, and your eye-lids charged heavily with tears. What has occurred?' he asked with affectionate alarm. 'Has it been such a sorrowful sacrifice for you to change your opinions?' 
                  'No, oh no! Schuyler!' she answered with energetic emotion. 'I only repent that I have not sooner been true to myself!' 
                  Rivingstone had led her to a seat in the hall, and was watching her countenance with curiosity and solicitude. It was a sweet countenance for any one to gaze upon. Tearful and pale though it now was, it possessed the most exquisite lineaments of beauty. Her eyes were blue and full of tenderness; and the pure alabaster of her brow was shaded by the softest brown hair. Her person was a little undersized, and of faultless symmetry. She was just such a fair flower as one like Schuyler Rivingstone might be supposed to cherish with love and devotion. She was quite unlike in her personal appearance, his sister. Isabel was a Dian, a bold and spirited creature, full of animation and fire, and possessed of great firmness of character. Grace was a Niobe; gentle, drooping, loving, yet not deficient in energy of character when circumstances called it into exercise. She was the daughter of an American officer, who had, at first, been a warm loyalist; but afterwards became a bold and active patriot. He took up arms first for the crown; but very soon afterwards, convinced that the American cause was just, he entered into the contest for the independence of his country. Her mother, who belonged to a proud Tory family had educated her in the principles of servile vassalage to loyalty. Her father, a gentleman of wealth, political influence and military talents, combined with great personal courage, which led him often into situations of great peril, had never prevailed to make Grace change her views as he had done, and think with himself upon the merits of the contest of arms. The mother's teaching and influence prevailed over the daughter's mind. Major Lee had joined the army of Washington on its first organization, and the brilliant exploits he achieved were the theme upon every tongue. His family had remained in the city after the retreat of the American army, Mrs. Lee knowing that her political character would be a sufficient protection to her and her property. 
                  Even the eloquence of young Rivingstone, her lover, had not been hitherto sufficient to change the opinions of Grace. She believed her father to be acting in error, and that Schuyler had given himself to a cause that threatened him and all who engaged in it with ruin. The marriage of Grace and Schuyler had only been deferred by the opposition of her mother, who said openly that she would rather see her daughter buried than wedded to a rebel! Grace loved her mother, and respecting her prejudices, which were also her own, she had yielded to their influence, and had made it a condition with Rivingstone that her hand should be his only with his renunciation of the principles of the rebels. This he had playfully refused to do, whenever she urged it, answering that he expected first to make a good rebel of her. 
                  His surprise, therefore, may be conceived when he received from her, an hour preceding his present visit, the following note, written in pencil, and evidently, in a hurried manner, 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 'Thursday Evening. 
                                 'DEAR RIVINGSTONE:
                               
                              'I have something of the utmost importance to say to you. I have become a rebel from this hour! Hasten to me by half-past nine at the latest, and you shall learn what I have to communicate. 
                              
                                 'In haste, 
                                 'GRACE LEE.'
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  This was the note which drew our hero to visit her at this hour. 
                  'Some deep motive-some very serious cause has brought about this change in you, dear Grace,' he said, as he observed her troubled countenance after her reply. 'What has occurred?' 
                  'My father! oh-my dear, poor father!' she cried, clasping her hands together with an air of the most poignant distress! 
                  'What of him, Grace?' 
                  'He is in prison!' 
                  'In prison?' 
                  'Yes. He was taken prisoner in Jersey three days ago by a detachment of the king's troops!' 
                  'Where did you hear of this?' 
                  'To-night, not two hours ago. My mother has just gone to General Howe's, where you know, there is to be a gay supper and dancing, when a person came up the avenue and handed me a letter, first asking me, if I was Major Lee's daughter.' 
                  'Who was he? 
                   
                  'He was dressed as a citizen; but I could not see his face: and as soon as he gave me the letter, he turned and hurried from the gate, saying he should call for a reply to-morrow night, at this hour. 
                  'Have you the letter?' asked Rivingstone with deep anxiety at the intelligence. 
                  "Here it is. It is from my father. You may read and judge whether I have not reason to be sad and to become a foe to those who have taken him captive.' 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 'AMBOY, Oct., 1766.
                               
                              'MY DEAREST CHILD,-I write you from a prison, and trust my words will now have weight with you. I have been taken prisoner by a party which was despatched from Staten Island expressly to entrap me. I had been on severe duty for several nights, watching on the coast, to prevent any parties landing for foraging, and had quartered, two leagues from this place, with a small force of ninety dragoons. At midnight, last night, we were surprised by four hundred British and Tories, and, after a hard battle, were forced to surrender, prisoners of war. I lost several brave fellows, and, to add to my grief, I learn that our surprisal was the result of treachery. I am now lying chained hand and foot to the floor, my right hand only being at liberty, of a dungeon in which malefactors are only confined just before execution. This barbarous treatment my captors defend on the plea that Washington has British soldiers confined in the same manner. This I do not believe; and if it is so, they are so held by way of reprisal; for General Washington knows that several of our officers are kept in chains by the enemy. How long I shall remain in this condition I know not. It is probable that General Howe will refuse to exchange me so long as he can help it, for he knows I shall not fail to serve my country hereafter as faithfully as I have done. Moreover, he may look upon me as a loyalist taken in arms, for you know I was once so blind as to be one for the first few weeks of this contest. 
                              'I write to you, Grace, lest you should hear my capture by other sources, and the rumor that I have since died of my wounds, which I hear from the honest fellow who takes this has got abroad. I was wounded slightly in five places, but they are mere hurts and are doing well. 
                              I should be content to lie here in chains, if I only knew that my dear child was true to her country. This knowledge would lighten my imprisonment. But the reflection that my only and beloved child may be at this moment while I write seated a guest at the board of Earl Howe, by whose order I lie in chains, and by her presence, as it were, makes me two-fold his prisoner; this grieves me to the heart. Oh! my child, how can you forget what you owe to your country? Why do you take sides with its tyrants and oppressors? If my captivity will open your eyes and make an honest rebel of you, I willingly endure it. 
                              'I write with difficulty, and only a little at the time. One of the sentinels who guards me is an American Tory, but, as I have done his family in the Jerseys service, and once saved his grey-headed father's life, he has furnished me with ink and paper, and promises to give this letter to one who will carry it safely. I trust my imprisonment will open the eyes of your mother to the error of which she is guilty; but in this I have little confidence. On you my hopes are fixed. Send me a few changes of linen and books. 
                              'The bearer will call before he leaves the island, for them. This favor might be granted by General Howe; but I do not wish you to make any application to him on my behalf. I would rather die in prison than that Tory influence, exerted by my child, should be the instrument of my liberation. God bless you. 
                              
                                 'Your affectionate father, 
                                 'FERDINAND LEE.'
                               
                            
                            
                              'P.S.-I have just learned that I am to be sent prisoner to England.' 
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  'I deeply sympathize with you, dear Grace,' said Rivingstone, when he had ended this letter. 'What a noble spirit it breathes. Are such men to be the willing slaves of 
                        tyrrany
                        tyranny
                     ? This, then, has made you an American in feeling? 
                  'I confess it did not alone. It at first pierced my heart with pity for my father, and regret for his having taken up arms, rather than with hatred to the King's cause, and my first impulse was to seek General Howe and use my influence as a friend to England to obtain either my father's liberation, or at least some mitigation of his condition.' 
                  'Did you obey this impulse? Have you seen Lord Howe? he demanded as he saw her hesitation, and appeared surprised. 
                  'Yes, to my shame be it spoken. I had no sooner read his letter than I hastened to this man-' 
                  'Alone? 
                  'Yes. My mother had been gone with the carriage about ten minutes, when I disguised myself in my servant woman's hood and cloak, and hastened to the quarters of the British General. The sounds of music already reached my ears when I came near, and the glare of the lights from the ball and drawing-rooms, filled the square. I applied for admission at the private side door of the house, sending up word that a female wished to see General Howe, on very important business. The footman, at first reluctant to take my message, returned and conducted me by a private stair-way, to the library, where I found Lord Howe in full costume, waiting to see me. 
                  'Well, woman, what would you say?' he asked in his austere manner. 'Are you charged with any message touching our affairs. Who hath sent you?' 
                  'I came, my lord,' I answered firmly, 'on my own responsibility.' As I spoke I put back my hood, and he recognised me, I having seen and been presented to him at his levee last evening. 
                  'Miss Lee!' he exclaimed with surprise. 
                  'It is, my lord,' I answered. 
                  'To what happy circumstance do I owe this honor? I was just inquiring of Madam your mother, if you were not to honor us. But why with this guise, and this mystery?' 
                   
                  'My lord,' I answered, 'you are not ignorant of the friendship of my mother and myself for the king, and that our wishes have ever been, that success may crown his arms, and the revolted provinces be subjected to his rightful rule!' 
                  'I know your loyalty to be unimpeachable, Miss Lee," he resumed. I wish I could say as much for that of your father!' 
                  'Of him I came to speak, my lord,' I answered. 'I have just received the painful news of his having been taken prisoner!' 
                  'When?' he asked with a look of surprise and pleasure. 
                  'Last night,' I answered. 
                  'This is new to me. How learned you this?' 
                  'It matters not, my lord,' I answered. 'I have certain knowledge that my father lives in chains, in the prison at Amboy, which some of your troops have lately seized. I know too, that he is bound in chains.' 
                  General Howe made me no reply, but after a minute's reflection he rung a bell and a footman entered. 
                  'Say to Colonel Cuyler I wish to see him,' he said. 
                  When the officer entered, he said to him in a quick, earnest tone, 
                  'Has a courier come upon the island to-night?' 
                  'Ten minutes since, sir, with despatches to you, and a rumor that a celebrated American officer has been taken prisoner with a party of dragoons. I was only waiting the termination of your interview here to lay them before you-the courier is Captain Maxwell, who waits in the hall.' 
                  General Howe tore open the despatches, glanced rapidly over them, and then turning to me, said, 
                  'You are rightly informed, Miss Lee; and it would seem your couriers are more prompt than mine. It is true your father is our prisoner; and as a friend to our arms you will of course rejoice with me.' 
                  'This was spoken so coldly, Rivingstone, so deficient in every feeling of sympathy for me, that my heart was chilled. 'Shall I,' thought I, 'sacrifice the feelings of the daughter to those of the subject. Shall I cling to a cause that calls me to rejoice over my father's captivity, and triumph in his imprisonment? The wickedness of my conduct forced itself upon my mind, and I began to realize the whole extent of my guilt.' 
                  'I cannot forget that your captive is my father, my lord,' I answered with emotion. 
                  'You should forget it! He has forfeited the protection of his king, and those who love the king should withhold from him also their affection. You should think and act, not as the daughter of Mr. Lee, a rebel partizan; but as the subject of Great Britain; and with her rejoice over the defect of her foes.' 
                  This, Rivingstone, was language that you may be assured found no echo in my heart. I have ever dearly loved my father, though I have wept over what I believed his errors. Lord Howe discovered my repugnance to these strange sentiments in my face, and looked displeased. 
                  "Why have you called to see me?' he coldly asked. 
                   
                  'To intercede for my father,' I answered, with the tears rushing into my eyes. 
                  'You will plead for him in vain, Miss Lee,' he answered sternly. 'Those who speak in behalf of rebels, expose themselves and their own loyalty to suspicion.' 
                
                
                  CHAPTER IV. 
                  THE RENCONTRE. 
                  'THEN be my loyalty suspected, my lord,' I answered, indignant at his want of feeling, 'if filial affection be treason to the king, then I am a traitor. My father, though taken in arms against the troops of his Majesty, is no less my father. He is in prison and in chains, and I am come hither to intercede in his behalf.' 
                  'I cannot listen to you, Miss Lee.' he answered. 'The possession of your father's person is to me a gratifying circumstance. Nothing you can urge will prevail upon me to interfere with the disposition which has been made of him by the lieutenant-colonel commanding the detachment which made him prisoner. He has been taken in arms, and must submit to the fate which he has brought upon himself. Have you any thing more to request of me?' 
                  'I made him no reply; but gathering my cloak and hood about me, I turned away from him with my heart almost bursting with mingled grief and indignation. I left the house and hastened home, whence I addressed you the note which has brought you hither, dear Rivingstone. From this hour I am an American woman. From this hour I am a friend to the cause to which you and my father have given your hearts and hands, and for which my father lies now in chains. I refuse lot or part with those who recognize no ties of kindred-who are ready to sacrifice the most sacred affections of the heart to national enmity. From this hour my heart is with my father and the cause he is suffering for. Insult and wrong have done more to open my eyes than all your eloquence or his, or even that love for my native land which should have been first in my heart.' 
                  'Nothing could make me happier than this result, Grace,' said Rivingstone, 'though I regret that it should have been affected by such unhappy causes. I cannot regret, however, that you have had this interview with Lord Howe. It proves to you that he cares nothing for the people of the provinces, whether they be loyal or no. He only wants the provinces subdued to the crown. Had you been a born English-woman thus pleading, he would have heard you and yielded to your wishes. But these proud English despise every one not born on their own little isle. To be a provincial is to be an inferior. Hence he despised your appeal. He and his officers laugh at the Tory ladies while they flatter them. Thank God, dear Grace, the snare is broken and you have escaped. Now let us talk of your father. Oh, how it rejoices my soul to know that henceforth our hearts will be one on the only subject upon which they have been divided. Now we can converse freely, without fear of giving or taking offence. Let us speak of your father. What can be done for him? He must not lie in prison. 
                  'I knew, Oh, I felt you would say so, Rivingstone,' she exclaimed, taking his two hands and pressing them in hers with enthusiastic emotion; 'I knew that you would feel thus. It was that I might talk to you of him that I sent for you.' 
                  'Let me read the letter once more,' he said, thoughtfully. 
                  She gave it into his hand, and while he read it slowly over, her eyes rested upon his face with the looks of one whose only hope and dependance were there. 
                  'In Amboy. The English have just taken possession of that post, throwing their troops into it from the island without opposition. He is probably in the gaol of the town. I have been there and have seen this prison. It is a strong building, and situated in the centre of the place.' 
                  'Oh, that some way could be devised. If you will aid my dear father in escaping, dearest Rivingstone, I will, in face of all my mother's opposition, become your wife. From this moment you and my father are all to me.' 
                  'Do I hear truly?' exclaimed Rivingstone, his fine face illuminated and beaming with joyful surprise. 
                  'I pledge you my hand, Rivingstone, so that my father is once more free.' 
                  'I accept the dear pledge,' he answered, pressing it to his lips. 
                  'Yet how can you save him,' she said, despondingly. 'He is chained and strictly guarded. He is confined in the centre of a town filled with enemies, for such are the British now to me.' 
                  'With such a prize in view, dear Grace, improbabilities may be overcome. I had begun to fear we should never wed, knowing your strong prejudices against a rebel, and the filial respect and fear you entertained for your mother-I can hardly regret events which have contributed to conquer these.' 
                  'My mother's wishes are to me no longer laws. She is both foe to my father and to me, if, when she hears of his captivity she does not withdraw herself from the society of those who hold her husband in chains' 
                  'Yet, if I rightly know her character, she will not cease to smile with complacency upon Lord Howe and the officers of his staff.' 
                  'Nay, I should not be surprised, if, to shield herself from suspicion, she should give a party to them, and, by excess of attentions, turn aside any doubts that might arise as to her loyalty standing this test to which it is put. My poor mother! She loves my father, but she loves her own pride more.' 
                  While this conversation was going on between Grace and Rivingstone, Lord Howe had singled out Madame Lee in the dancing-room, whither he had returned soon after Grace left him; and approaching her, said, with the look of one who had disagreeable intelligence to communicate, 
                  'I am sorry to convey ill-tidings to you, Madame.' 
                  'What has happened? no defeat to the royal arms, I trust,' said Mrs. Lee, a lady of tall and stately bearing, and with a severe countenance; her dignified person richly attired in purple velvet, the corsage of which was blazing with diamonds. 
                  'Your loyalty, dear Madam, is ever uppermost,' answered the Earl with a smile. 'I trust it will bear the shock of what I have to bring to bear upon it. I have just had intelligence that last night a deserter from the rebels brought intelligence to Colonel Percival of the Seventy-first, that a party of one hundred horse were bivouacked not far from Amboy, in a very retired glen, which might be surprised. Percival crossed over with about three hundred infantry, and succeeded in capturing them, and taking their commander prisoner. He is now in prison at Amboy. It is with regret I communicate his name. The prisoner is your husband, Major Lee, so styled.' 
                  Madame Lee started and turned pale; but recovering herself, she said with firmness, 
                  'I regret to hear that Mr. Lee is in captivity, my Lord; but I can make no appeal in his behalf. He is your prisoner, and I trust you will be guided in your treatment of him without any reference to me or my daughter! We are friends of his majesty, and as such, can have little sympathy even in the misfortunes of our nearest friends, when they have brought them upon themselves by taking up arms against their lawful sovereign.' 
                  'I am gratified to hear you speak in this manner, Madame. Your husband has brought his own destiny upon himself, as you remark. Let him reap as he has sown. He is put in chains in his cell for the purpose of retaliating upon Mr. Washington, who has put three British soldiers in fetters, taken on Long Island Plains.' 
                  'Mr. Lee in chains?' 
                  'Yes, madame!' answered the Earl, who seemed to take a malicious satisfaction in trying her loyalty in the most trying manner. 
                  'Is his life in peril?' she asked with some emotion. 
                  'No, not unless Mr. Washington should take the lives of one of these men. He has charged one of them with having committed a murder, and the other two as being loyalists who deserted from his forces. If one of them dies, Major Lee surely holds his life in jeopardy! The most humble British soldier is of higher rank and consideration with me than the best of the self-styled rebel-generals! It is probable Mr. Lee will be sent to England, an order having been just received from the Ministry ordering all rebel prisoners above the rank of Captain to be sent to England.' 
                  'My husband is in your power. I ask no clemency for him at your lordship's hands. Should I seek his release I should forfeit the reputation of that loyalty upon which I pride myself!' 
                  'I fear your daughter's loyalty has taken offence at this captivity of her father!' 
                  'How? what has she said? Has your lordship spoken with her?' 
                  'Yes; though perhaps I ought not to divulge the matter, as doubtless she would rather it was kept private. By some means she got intelligence of her father's imprisonment ere it reached my ears, and was here but a brief space ago to plead with me in his behalf!' 
                  'My daughter!' exclaimed Madam Lee with incredulous astonishment. 
                  'Yes, Madam. And when I declined having any thing to do with the affair, (for we must make examples, and it is'nt every day a prisoner of his rank and character falls into our hands,) her loyalty took offence, and I should not be surprised if she turned whig in revenge!' This was said with a smile. Madam Lee looked at him for several seconds with surprise; and when satisfied that what he had spoken was the truth, she began to tremble for herself, lest she might also come under suspicion. 
                  'My lord, what you have said astonishes me. I left my daughter at home, as she declined coming on the plea of having been up late last night at the levee. And yet she has been here to see you. If she proves false, my lord, I assure you that she shall do no harm either as spy or traitor, as some, young as she, have done already! I will converse with her and apprise you of any defection.-Be assured, my lord, I shall not wink at it; but were she thrice my daughter I should hold her as an enemy! I trust, my lord, you will not let any suspicion extend to me!' 
                  'By no means, Madam Lee. Of your loyalty I am well assured. It would be as well to keep an eye on your daughter. Persons in her condition of life, and with her intelligence, are apt to become dangerous enemies. The letter of a maiden written from within the walls of a besieged city, not that such is the case now, once was the instrument by which the city was taken, and an empire overthrown. As a spy one clever woman like her would be more useful to the foe, and dangerous to us, than twenty men!' 
                  'I warrant you, my lord, she shall do no mischief if I can prevent it!' 
                  In a few minutes afterward Madam Lee ordered her carriage. 
                  We will now return to Rivingstone and Grace. 
                  'The obstacles in the way of obtaining your father's release are no doubt great,' said the young man, 'but courage and perseverance can overcome every thing. Before the motives I have to inspire me, all difficulties will melt away. Courage, dear Grace. I have in my mind already half a plan conceived which may bring us success. If I can meet Logan to-night, between us I feel confident that something can be done!' 
                  'The brave McLeod and you together can effect whatever can be achieved.-But, Oh, Rivingstone, for my sake do not expose your life. Remember that my father's liberty, purchased with your death or even your imprisonment would render it scarce a boon. For my sake be guarded, and act with caution while you act with boldness. I have thought of a plan, but I fear it is too wild, and that you would not consent to it.' 
                  'Name it, dear Grace.' 
                  'That disguised as one of the country girls of the Jersies, I seek him out in his prison, a seller of fruit. 
                  'Your beauty and birth every eye would detect. No, no; and besides,' he added, smiling, 'what could you do, dearest Grace, even should you reach Amboy and get to see your father through the grate of his prison?' 
                   
                  'I might convey to him tools by which he could sever his chains. I might be inspired by some good spirit with a way to save him.' 
                  'I fear you would be likely to fail, dear Grace. Leave it with me. With the fair prize of your hand in prospect I shall be the most likely to succeed.-Now I must take leave of you. What is done should be done without delay.-If he goes to England he may be removed on board one of the frigates and then all hope is gone! I shall devise some means of accomplishing my purpose ere another hour passes.' 
                  'Shall I not see you again?' she asked earnestly. 
                  'Perhaps not. I will try and say a word before I go, or leave 'good bye' in a line for you with Pete, who will convey it to you with his characteristic caution. I am desirous of seeing Logan before he quits the island. We must both leave to-night, or it will be difficult to do so; for there was a rumor in Hewitt's Coffee House that Howe intended to deny passes to all after tomorrow. He thinks the wives and children of the rebels that are left behind may act as a check upon them, and prevent them from firing the town, as some have said there was a threat to do. He knows also that every man who leaves the city will add another to the rebel forces. So I must depart to-night. I wish I knew who brought the letter to you from your father.' 
                  'He was a very small thin man, and wore a leather cap and yellowish or brick dust coloured trowsers, with a linsey woolsey Jersey frock. I only saw him a moment by the light from the hall door.' 
                  'He would be of service to me if I could fall on him, as doubtless he is in the confidence of your father! See that the letter is destroyed at once, for the honest man who stood sentry over your father, holds his life in peril every moment the letter remains in existence.-Besides your mother should not see it, nor know that you have been in correspondence with your father! Let her not know I have been here! Keep from her the fact of your change of political

                        opinions
                     . Betray no emotions at your father's imprisonment, should she speak of it; for she will be sure to hear of it. I cannot recommend too much caution to you. In the meanwhile have hope and believe that I shall be successful, and that you will ere long see your father!' 
                  Thus speaking, he tenderly folded her to his heart and parted from her, her tears flowing like rain upon his cheek as he released her from her lingering embrace. He had not gone twenty steps from the gate before a carriage dashed past him and drew up before it. He waited a moment and saw that it was that of Madam Lee, for although he could not distinguish it in the dark, he recognised the voice of the coachman as he reined up his horses. 
                  'She has heard, probably, of Major Lee's imprisonment, and is hastening to inform Grace,' he said as he again passed on his way; 'God give the poor girl all the presence of mind she needs at this hour. I should like to know how Madam received the intelligence! I fear her extravagant loyalty will overcome that which she owes as a wife.' 
                  He continued along the street northward until he approached the barracks where Legan McLeod had first been challenged. He was under the necessity of passing the guard-house to reach Logan's lodgings, which were in the street below, and nearly opposite Jemmy Newcomb's ale-house. 
                   
                  'Howe and York' was his brief reply to the abrupt challenge. He was passing on his way down the street, when he thought he heard at the foot of it the clashing of arms. Hastening forward at a run he soon reached the corner, where he came upon one man contending with three soldiers. He had his back to the wall and defended himself with a sword! There was light enough for Rivingstone to see that the individual thus set upon by such odds was a young Provincial artisan. Rivingstone was not without arms. Drawing a short sword from beneath his cloak, he pressed forward and assailed the nearest, at the same time crying, 
                  'Let us cut the fellows down!' 
                  'Mr. Rivingstone, you are here in good time, for these fellows are getting the better of me,' answered the young man; and the two friends, pressing the assailants closely, put them to flight, and pursued them for some distance up the street. 
                  "What is this? How did it happen?' asked Rivingstone, as they stopped and turned back together. 
                  'I was dogged by some one, after leaving my house half an hour ago, and watching my opportunity, I darted into a narrow place between two houses, and let the person pass me. By the air and outline of his figure, I was satisfied that it was a British grenadier. He passed on, and, missing me, returned. At length I saw him go up the street and speak to some persons hitherto concealed by the darkness. The four then passed me. The other three were also soldiers. By his conversation with them I discovered that I was still the object of their search.' 
                  'What could be their motive? What have you done!' 
                  'A lieutenant of grenadiers insulted my mother, and I ran him through the body.' 
                  'Then you are not safe. Come with me. How was it they met you?' 
                  'At length, after they passed on, I left my retreat and went to my lodgings, armed myself, and took with the what camp furniture I needed, and left with the intention of seeking a means of getting from the island to the main, to join Logan McLeod. As I turned the corner, I came upon three fellows, who set upon me as you have seen, and, but for you, I might have been taken prisoner.' 
                  'What became of the fourth fellow?' 
                  'I don't know, unless he went into the tavern to drink.' 
                  'You say you go to join Logan. Where is he?' 
                  'He has by this time left the town. Myself and thirty-one others are to join him as we can get away, in the Bergen Wood." 
                  'Then haste, for your life is in peril here. Say to Logan that I will join him some time to-morrow.' 
                
                
                   
                  CHAPTER V. 
                  THE HUSSAR. 
                  'I, Too, will seek Logan,' said Rivingstone, as he went on his way after parting with the young artisan; 'at Bergen Wood, said he! Then the rumor is true. I heard to-day that Logan was about raising and organizing a body of young men at his own charge, once more to take the field as he had done. I will seek him and lay before him poor Grace's troubles and together we will see if we can't get the brave Major Lee out of the hands of his foes! His danger is truly great; for the English General will be sure to charge him with desertion from the king's side, and so it will be a chance if he escapes being shot! I have put my hand and heart to this matter and I will see him free or perish with him!' 
                  At this moment a man came forth from the ale-house opposite which Rivingstone had arrived, on his way to seek Logan at his lodgings, hoping yet he might find him there before he should have left the city. 
                  'Ho, who goes there?' bluntly demanded the man, throwing aside the ale-house door so that the light might stream forth upon him. Rivingstone at once saw that he was a grenadier of Howe's guard; and that he was the fourth man of the party that had been waylaying the young provincial, at once occurred to his mind. 
                  'Who did you expect it was, my friend?' he answered pleasantly. 
                  'Vell, you aint the chap I wos in hopes it vos,' responded the grenadier. 'Are you king or rebel, speak?' demanded the soldier, with a tipsy air, and presenting the butt of his musket at his breast. 
                  'What if I say "king"?' 
                  'Then I'd ask you in the tap to take a mug.' 
                  'What if I say "rebel"?" inquired Rivingstone, disposed to humor the man, for as Logan's lodgings were nearly opposite, he could not enter them without getting him out of the way; for Rivingstone had not yet taken any active part in arms, though his sympathies were well known to his friends to be with the Americans; and he did not desire to draw any notice upon himself or his movements just as he was on the eve of leaving the city, that might lead to his detention. Logan was well known as an active partisan, and it was probable that his abode was closely watched, perhaps by the very soldier before him. Hence he resolved to be cautious, lest carelessness might prevent him from taking any steps towards the release of the prisoner at Amboy. 
                  'If you had said rebel, I'd brought you here under guard and be - to you!' responded the man coarsely. 
                  'Well, to drink with a man is better than to have him run him through the body, so I will say 'king!' But where were your comrades going with a man under arrest up the street as I came down?' 
                   
                  'My comrades? Was there three of'em?' 
                  'Yes! 
                  'And a man under arrest?' asked the grenadier eagerly. 
                  'Yes! Said I not so?' 
                  'Then they have him at last, and I had no finger in the pie!' 
                  'Who was he?' 
                  'A young rebel who nearly killed our sergeant Walling by putting six inches of a bayonet into his side, just because he took a fancy to kiss a handsome widow, vich might ha' been the rebel's mother and might not! So they have him fast, hey! Thanks, good citizen. Come to the parade to-morrow and you'll see a rebel shot through the head; for Walling 'll die, and vether he does or not, the rogue 'll be shot for an example! Vhy, bless us, Master Newcomb,' he added, turning round to the little soldier of the 'Blue Star,' 'vhy, bless us, iv his lordship don't make a hexample of some kind, it vont be safe for a grenadier to kiss a wuman, and his life 'ant safe an hour! Vell, I am glad he's taken. Now I can afford to have another mug! Come in, young gentleman, and don't refuse to touch mugs with one of his majesty's grenadiers. It's a condescension and you should think it so!' 
                  Rivingstone entered the tap, not because he was invited or intended to drink with the grenadier, but at that instant his eye fell upon a placard stuck up on the wall of the tap, which arrested it. It was in large capitals and read as follows: 
                  
                     "ALL ASPIRING HEROES HAVE NOW AN OPPORTUNITY OF DISTINGUISHING THEMSELVES BY JOINING THE QUEENS' RANGER HUSSARS, COMMANDED BY LIEUTENANT-COLONEL SIMCOE.'
                     "Any spirited young loyalist will receive every encouragement, be immediately mounted on an elegant charger, be furnished with handsome uniform, arms and full accoutrements, &c., to the amount of FORTY GUINEAS, by applying to CORNET SPENCER, at his quarters in Water Street, or his Rendevous, Hewett's Tavern, near the Coffee-house, or at the Blue Star.
                     Whoever brings a recruit, shall instantly receive TWO GUINEAS.
                     "VIVANT REX ET REGINA."
                   
                  'Vell, vot do you think ov it?' inquired the grenadier, holding his mug to his lips and waiting with it there 
                        nntil
                        until
                      Rivingstone had read it through. The young patriot made him at first no reply. He was deeply pondering some subject which had evidently been suggested to his thoughts by the placard, at length he turned round and said, addressing him, 
                  'I thought Captain Simcoe's corps was full!' 
                  'No. There are a dozen or twenty more nice boys wanted to make up the complement and then hey for the Jerseys!' 
                   
                  'I knew that they were ordered into Jersey. Do they go soon?' 
                  'Vell, it's likely by Saturday. Simcoe, now he's got the command, won't let no ground grow under his horses' hoofs! Devilish fine corps, young man. You hant seen 'em!' 
                  'Yes, I saw them on parade to-day. I am told that most of his hussars are loyalists.' 
                  Yes, pretty much the whole corps. There is only here and there an old European cut an thrust among 'em to keep 'em in trainin.' 
                  'There are several young gentlemen among them, I believe.' 
                  'Yes, young provincial gentlemen. How would you like to list. I see you are taken with the terms?' 
                  'Hist, t-t!' said the little ale-house keeper with a gesture of caution. 'The young gentleman may be might like to list as an officer but not as a soldier. He belongs to one of our Nabob families," added Jemmy in an under tone. 
                  'Vell, vot if he does. There are as good provincial nabobs in the Queens' as he is. Forty guineas is as good to him as to you or I. Let him alone. Don't you see he means to list? If as how you be, young gentleman, just oblige me by letting me show you the way to Cornet Spencer's, and so you see,' he added slyly to Jemmy, 'I shall get the two guineas for bringing a recruit,' 
                  'I will go with you, grenadier,' said Rivingstone, abruptly. 'Lead on and I will follow you at your own pace.' 
                  'But you haven't drank your mug. You must empty that. You are too sober to list. Who ever heard of a sober recruit? You must be drunk, so I can bring you. If you carry yourself, they'll be likely to pay over the two guineas to you, you see.' 
                  At this speech, Jemmy Newcome laughed very heartily, that is heartily for him, his laugh being not unlike, in sound, a brace of swallows twittering. The grenadier acknowledged the compliment by a patronizing nod and look of approval, and finding that his 'recruit' would not get drunk enough to carry, he went out of the door at a slightly reeling halt, followed by Rivingstone. 
                  'The Britisher looks more like a recruit just now than Master Rivingstone,' said Jemmy, as he looked after them. 'I wonder what this young gentleman means by saying he will 'list. P'raps he hopes to buy an ensigncy or some such. He wouldn't 'list in the ranks. Vell, he is a fine, tall young man, is Master Rivingstone, and belongs to good tory blood, though I have heard he spoke loudly in the coffee-house a few nights back agin the king. If I had said it I had been hanged. But money will do anything for a man in this wicked world o' sin and sorra 'cept git him to heaven.' With this pious conclusion to his remarks, Jemmy fastened the door by driving the bolt with his heel firmly into its socket in the floor, and placing a bar across it in addition. He then took a long draught at his brandy flask, and opening a sort of chest behind his bar, he fastened up the cover of it to a nail against the wall, and blowing out his lamp, he lightly sprang into the chest and coiled himself upon a matress therein, drawing above him a coverlit and blanket. This was Jemmy's bed; for he was a bachelor; a chest is a very good bed for a bachelor. 
                  Jemmy had slept about half an hour, when he was startled from his slumbers by the loud ringing of a bell in the Tower of Old Trinity at the head of the street. Then the iron tongue of the bell in the Dutch church gave out its voice; then shouts of 'fire!' were heard afar off, and then taken up close at hand. 
                  'Somebody's house is a-fire,' was Jemmy's very natural remark as he jumped out of his box and run to open his window shutters. He had scarcely unfastened them when he was terrified by the sound of cannon mingling its roar with the clangor of all the bells in town. 
                  'I wonder what has 'appened!' he ejaculated. 'P'raps the rebels has come to take the town! P'raps it's the Indians riz! P'raps-Lord bless me! There goes more cannons and muskets! I wonder wot it is!' 
                  He cautiously opened his shutter. The sight that met his gaze almost overpowered him with fear. The very atmosphere seemed on fire, it was filled with so fierce a reflection of red-rays. Looking northward he beheld the flames bursting from several roofs, and far and wide the wind bore the sparks and flaming brands. 
                  'They 'ave sot the city a-fire,' ejaculated the appalled little man. 
                  This time he had guessed right. The city was on fire, whether set on fire or not is a question we leave for the historian to decide. The roar of the conflagration sounded to his ears like the roar of the ocean in a storm. The streets were alive with soldiers and citizens. Squadrons of horse were dashing along towards the scene at top speed with drawn swords, and columns of troops were rushing forward to aid in extinguishing the flames. The thunder of engine wheels, the shouts of the soldiers, the clamour of the bells, the discharge of alarm guns, the roar of the flames and the crimson brilliancy of the whole presented a scene such as the little host of the Blue Star had never gazed upon or conceived. After satisfying his curiosity for the space of half a minute, he began with great trepidation and haste to gather up his mugs ready for flight. 
                  The conflagration, however, in less than an hour, and after consuming a dozen dwellings, was wholly subdued, and the city preserved from the devastation with which it was menaced. Jemmy replaced his mugs, and once more coiled himself up in his chest; and in a short time silence and darkness reigned over the city so lately the scene of such uproar and alarm. 
                  Hewitt's Tavern, at which Cornet Spencer had his rendezvous, was situated near the corner of Nassau and Wall streets, and was at the period of which we write a popular resort for the Tory politicians. It was a two story structure, with a far projecting roof supported by columns, ten feet out from the wall of the house, thus forming a verandah for both stories. In this verandah on the ground floor, as Rivingstone came up to it, with the grenadier, were seen several men in the hussar uniform. There were smoking pipes and drinking ale around a little table that had been brought outside side and placed upon the brick pavement of the 'stoope' for their 
                        accommotion
                        accommodation
                     . The tavern door was open and showed the tap filled with individuals both in the costume of citizens and soldiers. A lighted candle was placed upon the table in the open air, which cast its rays upon the faces of the four men around it. Two of them were Englishmen and the other two Provincials, one of whom wore the uniform of the Queen's Rangers, while the other was yet in his citizen's costume, save that he had a sword in his belt. The others were plying him with ale, while one of them was making a tipsy grandiloquent harangue to him upon the glories of war, and the especial honor it was to any man of spirit to serve in the 'Queen's.' 
                  Within the tap parallel scenes were going forward, every two hussars having between them a young provincial whom they were trying to persuade to enlist in 'the gallant Simcoe's crack corps!' The place altogether was a scene of confusion and revelry only to be found in the military rendezvous. 
                  'Vere is Cornet Spencer, Queens? asked the grenadier of those at the table. 
                  'What, have you brought a recruit, grenadier?' asked the man nearest him; at the same time trying to penetrate the gloom to scan the person of the stranger. 
                  'Yes, and a capital fellow he'll make. He is fit for a grenadier, six feet and one inch, if he is a foot. Where is the Cornet?' 
                  'Here I am, my lad,' briskly responded a dashy looking officer speaking from a side window. 'What have you there?' 
                  'Two 
                        gunieas
                        guineas
                     , sir,' answered the grenadier, pointing his thumb significantly and tipsily at Rivingstone. 
                  'Excellent. Bring him into my room, here?' 
                  'Vill you please valk in, sir?' asked the soldier turning to Rivingstone. 'You ant drunk, and so I cant carry you as ve ought to do. If you vill just allow me to place my hand on your shoulder, vy it vill look more as if I vos bringin' a recruit, you see, your honor.' 
                  'Very well, answered Rivingstone. 
                  The grenadier then laid his hand gently upon his arm and led him up the steps of the inn, and so through the tap into the apartment where sat Cornet Spencer, the gentleman whose name had figured so extensively in the placard. 
                  He was in a gay undress uniform with a smart scarlet foraging cap upon his head, and smoking a pipe. The buckles of his small clothes at the knee were loosened, and his feet were thrust into a pair of Indian bead-slippers, as if he had began to prepare for retiring for the night, the hour being already past eleven. 
                  On Rivingstone's entrance, he scanned him with a sharp, professional glance, and then looked at the grenadier with an approving nod. 
                  'Well, sir, you think you would like to try his majesty's service?' he said, addressing Rivingstone, with an air of certain deference, for he saw that the young man before him had the bearing of one in superior society. 
                  'It is my wish to do so, and in the cavalry of this corps, provided it is ordered, as rumor says, to join the army on the main land within a day or two. I do not wish to enlist to remain in the city on parade.' 
                  'This sounds well. The corps will be sent to the main soon, my man, but on what duty is not known. If you choose to enlist I will pledge you my honor you shall see service enough and that soon enough. We have a host of fine fellows in the corps. Promotion is speedy and sure. Forty guineas in horse and equipments and good pay and full rations, and plenty of fighting and glory.' 
                  'The corps joins the British line just at Amboy, I believe,' said Rivingstone. 
                  'There has been something said about that move, but Colonel Simcoe is so close that we can only guess. I have no idea what we shall do or where we shall go after leaving the island. If you choose to trust your fortunes with us you will soon know.' 
                  Rivingstone reflected a moment. His object might be defeated, he feared, by the very means by which he hoped to bring it about. We will here explain his motives of action, though perhaps the reader has already divined them. On reading the placard, it occurred to him that he had heard his father say in speaking of Colonel Simcoe that day at dinner, that the Queen's Ranger Hussars, both cavalry and infantry, were to be ordered to Jersey on some secret service, and that they would probably land at Perth Amboy. The offers of the placard suggested to him that if he would enlist in the Hussars, into which many young tory gentlemen had enlisted as volunteers, ambitious to serve under so brave a chief as Colonel Simcoe, he might be thrown into circumstances which would enable him to effect the liberation of the father of Grace. He had no sooner conceived the idea than he resolved to put it into execution, as we have thus far seen. As he had never borne arms against the English, as his father and sister and all the collateral members of his family were loyalists, and as he had only expressed his rebel opinions, the motives of his enlistment would be unsuspected, as the cause would be readily attributed to that change of opinion which was of daily occurrence. 
                  'Loyalists will only say, Schuyler Rivingstone has seen his error and desires to atone for it,' he said to himself; 'and patriots will brand me as a false partizan. Be it so. I must sacrifice something. Once my object attained, then my character will appear to friends and enemies in its true light.' 
                  'I am waiting for an answer, sir,' said the Cornet. 
                  'I will enlist.' 
                
                
                   
                  CHAPTER VI. 
                  THE SECRET ENTERPRISE. 
                  THE position of the British army in New York was not regarded by the Commander-in-chief either as a secure or a permanent one. Washington had crossed the Hudson, and was gathering his forces in the Jerseys, and it was well known that demonstrations were making on the part of the Americans to endeavor to recover possession of the city. 
                        Inteligence
                        Intelligence
                      had reached the city the morning after the events related in the preceding chapters, that a flotilla of boats was being constructed on the Raritan, for the purpose of affording conveyances for the rebel troops to the invasion of the town. As the approaches to New York were so open and extensive, and descent might be made upon the island upon many points which the British defences could not cover, the British general saw that it was important that the means which the American general depended upon for attacking the city should be destroyed. It therefore became an object with him that a bold effort should be made to destroy those boats, which were reported to be fifty in number. 
                  The English general was at his quarters when the intelligence of these preparations on the part of the enemy was brought to him by a special courier. Col. Simcoe was present when the despatch was opened, and the earl read to him the contents. 
                  'These boats must be burned, my lord,' said the commander of the Queen's Hussars, in a very decided tone. 
                  'They should be, Colonel Simcoe," answered his lordship; but I do not see that it is possible to reach them. The enemy is in possession of the interior of Jersey, and these barges are many leagues inland, near the source of a small river.' 
                  'The river Raritan. The mouth of it is at Amboy. The flotilla is above Amboy, says your intelligence, some ten leagues. If the Americans are suffered to complete and launch their boats, they will be likely to effect something with them.' 
                  'Yes, we may expect them invading us by water at any moment. Is it not possible to despatch secretly a number of barges from Staten Island, with orders to ascend the river in the night with suitable guides?' 
                  'It is possible. No doubt that the ascent might be achieved and the boats burned; but retreat afterwards by water would be impracticable. The deed would rouse the whole country, and before the party could reach the mouth of the river again, it would have to surrender to a superior force. Besides, the large town of Brunswick is on the river, and both in going up and returning this place would have to be passed. General Livingstone, you know, is stationed there with a large force." 
                  'True, Simcoe. I see there is no way of effecting our object. The completion of those barges will place our present position in great danger. We are likely to be surprised, however watchful we may be. Major Armstrong, who has sent me this information, says, that they are constructed to carry about ninety men each. I know of no way of stopping this attempt, but to sink vessels across the mouth of the Raritan.' 
                  'This would not defeat their object,' said Colonel Simcoe, who held the despatch in his hand. 'Here is a postscript, which you did not read to me, my lord. It says, that besides the boats building upon the Raritan, about as many more are on their way upon wheels from the Delaware.' 
                  'Yes, I noticed that. What does it suggest to your ready mind, sir? I see that you have something to say.' 
                  'That if we close up the mouth of the river, they will convey the whole of their boats across the land, and launch them into the Bay of New York, opposite the city." 
                  'This is true. Perhaps this may be their intended mode of attack; for to pass down the river would be to expose their enterprise to a defeat in the outset, from forces stationed at Amboy. You are right, Colonel Simcoe. The flotilla is to be carried across the country on wagon-wheels, and launched at some point opposite the city. If Washington can embark five thousand men from the Jersey shore in the night, I would not answer for the safety of our position here an hour. It is impossible to cover the whole extent of shore on this side, and our sagacious enemy might choose his own point of landing. This has become an important matter, sir. The safety of New York depends upon the destruction of those boats, Colonel Simcoe.' 
                  'Of that I am deeply impressed, your lordship. If your lordship will permit me to undertake the enterprise, I trust I shall be able to carry it through with success.' 
                  'You are always foremost, my dear Simcoe. I rely much on your courage and military skill; but I do not see how you can penetrate an enemy's country and destroy a flotilla on which they depend for recovery of their chief city, and which therefore will be strongly guarded.' 
                  'Give me only the commission, my lord, and I will see it executed,' responded the hussar officer with decision. 'The Americans, cautious as they are, would not be likely to place a guard over works thirty or forty miles in the interior, when they know there is not an enemy within a day's march. They will rest secure in the space of country that separates them from their foes. I have no doubt the boats are at this moment without other protection than the men who are constructing them. Fifty are nearly ready, and as many more on their way upon wheels from the Delaware. In a day or two the whole will be concentrated at one point. Then will be the time to make a general conflagration of the whole.' 
                  'Your plan seems feasible, if you could only reach them without being intercepted: and then, if you can, effect your retreat afterwards.' 
                  'This is my plan, my lord. I will land with my Hussars to-night on Staten Island, and proceed to Richmond to-morrow. The infantry of the corps can be sent over to-morrow. Let it be given out that a spy of rank is known to be on Staten Island, and that my corps is to guard closely all avenues of escape, so that he may not be able to quit the island. This will serve to draw attention from the true object in view, and turn aside the animosity of those who might watch our movements. It will, also, give cover to any parties of horse seen on the shore, and enable us to embark them without suspicion. As it is well known my corps are soon to quit New York for service at Amboy; this movement will not create alarm. And no one could, at least, divine its true destination. To-morrow night I could easily land on the Jersey shore at midnight, and in/four hours or less time, by marching on the round trot, reach Vacter's bridge where these boats lay. Of course I must have guides well acquainted with the country, which I can command, there being in my corps several Jersey loyalists on whom I can depend. 
                  'Is your corps full?' 
                  'Nearly so, my lord; I lack but some four or five men to make the number complete. They are all burning for action; and the rumor that we were destined for the first active service that opened, has given the fellows fine spirits. They are like a pack of blooded hounds that can hardly be restrained from the chase till the horn sounds the signal. Among them some of the first young men in the provinces. Young Rivingstone, a son of Mr. Rivingstone whom you know, enlisted.' 
                  'In the ranks?' 
                  'Yes, my lord; when I saw him this morning and knew who he was, I was surprised to see him; for some one had pointed him out to me as a rebel.' 
                  'He ought to be a good loyalist, for his father and sister are.' 
                  'I told him I hoped soon to see him advanced, and regretted he had not purchased a cornetcy, as Spencer wished to sell out. But he said he preferred making his way to any distinction he might attain to, from the ranks. He is a gentlemanly fellow, and has a princely eye. Washington would have made a Colonel of him on the spot for his face and figure!' 
                  'I am not surprised that the young colonists are anxious to gain distinction in arms under you, my gallant colonel! Your corps will cover themselves with glory.' 
                  'If your excellency will entrust to me this achievement, I do not fear but what they will,' answered the Hussar-chief with animation. 
                  'The affair is yours, Simcoe! You have my permission to make the attempt, and to draw what forces from the army you require to aid you in your purpose! The safety of New York hangs upon the success of this bold enterprise.' 
                  'I foresee that I shall be successful. Now that Lee is prisoner, his corps of cavalry are withdrawn from the neighborhood of Amboy, and the country is open to the very point at which we shall aim. There are no other rebel troops in the vicinity nigh enough to be communicated with, nor to march to intercept us ere we can get back to our place of debarkation. The militia are not to be regarded, as they will assemble as usual, tumultuously and without order, only at the very moment of the execution of our enterprise, and can do nothing effectual to impede it. My plan is, on reaching Vacter's Bridge to burn the boats with as much expedition as possible, and return in silence as far as the heights that overlook Brunswick, if possible, reaching there before day. By this time the whole country will be up and we shall be pursued. But to check this pursuit, and at the same time punish the Americans, I wish a detachment of the Infantry Rangers to penetrate the country after I land as far as the neighborhood of Brunswick, so that they can afford me support on my retreat, if hard pursued, and at the same time ambuscade the different cross roads, and surprise and cut off such parties that may be concentrating towards the point of retreat. I should not be surprised, were I able, if properly supported by the infantry, to bring off a large number of the enemy as prisoners. We shall at least create a wide-spread panic and intimidate our enemies for some time, at least.' 
                  'This is a very daring plan. It seems rash. But the object to be obtained is of vast moment, and something must be risked.' 
                  'Listen, then. My intention is to traverse the country by night as Lee's Legion. Our uniforms are green alike, and the country people thus deceived, would give no alarm, and so we should attain our object with comparative ease.' 
                  'You have my authority, Colonel Simcoe, to make the attempt. When do you wish to embark your corps for Staten Island?' 
                  'To-night.' 
                  'It is now noon. Boats from the fleet and flat barges shall be in readiness for you at the Battery. In the meantime I need not caution you to let nothing transpire as to the object in view, nor would I at any time place too much confidence in the loyalists.' 
                  The bold Hussar Colonel now proposed to take his departure, to prepare for this important enterprise, when his lordship said, 
                  'Have you any intelligence yet of this young provincial, McLeod?' 
                  'No, my lord. Every means has been taken to secure his arrest, but he is not to be found. I would give a thousand pounds to fall in with him. I would like to shift to his shoulders the obligation I owe him for surprising and taking me prisoner with others at our dinner party. He is a bold fellow to remain in the city so long as he has done, knowing what little cause we have to love him. If I had known earlier that he was here, I should have had him safe. He should not have done any more service for the rebels this war. Besides, I heard that he has remained here to organize a corps from among the young men of rebel politics.' 
                  'It is probable he has left the island.' 
                  'Did Colonel Cuyler know him when he signed the passport for him?' 
                  'No. I intimated to Cuyler to give passports to such respectable citizens as should apply in person for them. The Colonel says he was in his office when this young provincial was announced, who said carelessly he came for a passport. Cuyler had lying on his table several of them signed, and handed him one supposing of course he was a loyalist, the young man paying him the usual guinea fee, took it and left without any thing more passing between them. I have since then, restricted passports only to such as are known or are recommended by Governor Tryon as honest loyalists; and the name and description of the applicant are also to be given in it, so that we shall be more secure against imposition.' 
                  'Has your excellency ascertained any thing definite concerning the cause of the conflagration last night?' 
                  'Nothing. Several persons have been arrested but no one can be fixed upon as the incendiary. There is no doubt but that the fire was set by some of the rebel citizens, and their intention was to destroy the town so as to render it no longer inhabitable, and compel us to return to Staten Island.' 
                  'I have no question that this was the object in view.' 
                  'I have this day posted strong guards in various parts of the town, and henceforward I shall maintain the strictest vigilance. It must be annoying to you that this bold rebel partizan has eluded you, after having as it were placed his hands on the lion's paw.' 
                  'If we ever meet, I shall not fail to remind him of our former acquaintance. If this war lasts many years, he will become a prominent leader of the rebels, if he escapes lead and steel in the interim. Have you any further commands or instructions for me, my lord?' 
                  'Nothing now. I shall see you when you embark for Staten Island, to-night. Till then let there be the strictest secrecy preserved as to the intended operations.' 
                  The Colonel of Hussars then took his leave of the commander-in-chief and hastened to his barracks. The announcement that the corps was to get in readiness for leaving the island that night on secret duty was received with the most joyful demonstrations of satisfaction by the ambitious young hussars; and by none with more pleasure than by Rivingstone. From the moment he had enlisted he had identified himself with the corps; and remaining in the quarters that night, had in the morning assumed the uniform and accoutrements. Instead of the "charger" named in the placard to be presented to each recruit, he preferred his own horse, which he sent for: a favorite animal, fleet and well-trained, and remarkable for the beauty of his limbs and head. When Colonel Simcoe saw him mounted upon his back and prance around the barrack yard, he pronounced him the best mounted of any one in the corps. Rivingstone was a superb rider, and took a pride in displaying the beauty of his handsome chestnut, and the skill of his own horsemanship. At eight o'clock that evening the whole corps embarked for Staten Island, and landing in safety marched towards the village of Richmond, where they took up their quarters. Rivingstone was now sure that the destination of the corps must be to some point near Amboy; but what place he could not decide. He had heard of the American flotilla on the Raritan, but the idea that they were destined to destroy it, did not once occur to his mind. The flotilla was not only above Brunswick, a post where the Americans were concentrated in force, but it was in the very centre of a country into which the English had never yet penetrated; Amboy being the only point in the Jerseys which had been taken possession of by their arms. 
                   
                  How he was to contribute to the escape of Major Lee when he should reach Amboy, Rivingstone had as yet formed no determined mode of action. He resolved to be governed by circumstances as they should transpire. 
                  Rivingstone had not left New York without another interview with Grace, to whom he communicated the outlines of his plan so far as he had formed them. Her distress at realizing the danger to which he had exposed himself by enlisting as a Queen's Ranger Hussar would have led her to dissuade him from proceeding any further in the effort to rescue her father. 
                  'Rather,' said she, in tears, 'rather let me adopt some disguise and seek in person his release. If I am detected, I shall at least be set at liberty; while you, if detected, will be instantly executed.' 
                  'I know my danger, Grace, but I feel confident of the result. Leave the rescue of your father in my hands. Only give me your prayers. Within ten days I shall return to claim your hand.' 
                  It was thus they parted. To Isabel he sent a note, avoiding an interview. 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 'DEAR BEL:
                               
                              'You will be surprised to learn that I have joined Simcoe, and am now a Hussar. You must not laugh at me. We are all growing wise every day we live. Did you ever expect Simcoe could convert me to Toryism? Good bye. Send Pete to the barracks with my bay. 
                              
                                 'Your brother, 
                                 'SCHUYLER.'
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  The surprise, as well as joy of Isabel, on receiving this intelligence we will leave the reader to imagine. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER VII. 
                  THE BERGEN WOODSMEN. 
                  WE will now change the scene of our story from the fortified city to the free forests. Bergen wood was, at the period of which we write, an extensive forest of oak, larch, and maple, covering a ridge of considerable eminence, about three and a half miles westward of the Hudson, and about five miles from the city. It was interspersed with open meadow-land, and here and there from its dark bosom projected the bald precipice of some wild crag. A road wound through the wood and over the ridge, leading from the ferry, now called 'Jersey Ferry,' to Newark, and thence on to Brunswick. 
                  It was towards the close of the day that followed the embarkation of the Queen's Hussars from the Battery for Staten Island, that a group of armed men might have been seen standing together upon an open green terrace amid the woods that crowned Bergen height. The position which they occupied was elevated above the adjacent forest, and commanded a wide view of meadow, woodland, river and harbor. To the East, New York was visible, glancing in the light of the western sun; and in its waters were seen riding at anchor the vessels composing the British fleet. The tents of the British cantonment on the head of Staten Island shone like patches of snow. In the pass of the Kills, was an English sloop of war riding at anchor, to close all communication from the Jerseys by that avenue, with the city. South of their position stretched forest and farm for many a league, with here and there a hamlet relieving the dark bosom of the country. To the Westward, at the foot of the rock on which they stood, wound the road that led from the ferry towards Newark, the single spire of which pointed like a glittering needle, to the purple skies. 
                  The group or party consisted of full three score of stalwart looking young men, dressed for the most part in a peculiar costume, consisting of a gray frock and leathern small clothes, with jack-boots and slouching Shaker hats. They were armed with short carbines with large bores, and in belts about their waists were stuck broadswords and pistols, that looked as if worn rather for service than show. 
                  A few yards from the spot on which these men stood, and lower than the summit level of the ridge were tethered about sixty saddled horses; their bridles slipped back from their ears to enable them to feed upon sacks of corn that was poured with profusion before them. The person who acted as hostler to this formidable stable was a negro, who divided his care between them and a fire which blazed near, and was sending a column of blue smoke curling far up into the afternoon sky. Around this fire were several sides of mutton, wild turkies, pigs, horns and small kegs of cider and brandy. A large pile of horsemen's cloaks lay by with a sack of rifles. 
                  The whole scene was strikingly picturesque; but the stern, sober faces of the men upon the plateau above showed that they were not there merely to afford a subject for a painter's pencil. 
                  Their faces were turned anxiously northward towards a horseman's path which led along the top of the ridge, and at the extremity of which a man mounted on horseback was visible, seated in his saddle as motionless as a statue. 
                  'It is strange the Captain delays so long,' said one of the men. 'He said he should return by noon, and here it is past four!' 
                  He has, perhaps, had to go farther to find General Washington than he expected!' responded another, a strong built yeoman of six feet-and a half. 
                  'He ought to know this movement of the Rangers,' said a young man in whose voice and lineaments were recognizable those of the young Provincial artisan whom Rivingstone had so opportunely aided. 'If he comes not soon, I will ride and meet him!' 
                  'See, our vidette makes the signal! He is in sight!' cried the first speaker. 
                  'Now we shall have something to do,' said the young man of six feet and a half. 'Let us to horse, men, and wait his coming on!' 
                  The whole party, save the young artisan, descended from their elevated post, and hastening to their steeds, bridled them and leaped upon their backs. The artisan stood watching the path along which he expected to see the Captain approach. In a few minutes he saw a company of horseman rise on the verge of the hill, and leaving the vidette the whole cavalcade, came on at a fast hand-gallop. They were seven in all, and at their head as they came near was seen young Logan McLeod. He was splendidly mounted on a coal-black horse, which he managed with the grace and power of an Arabian rider. He wore a grey surtout and buff small clothes, with a brown beaver hat, the broad brim of which was looped boldly up in front. He was armed with pistols in his belt, and a very handsome small sword swung at his left side. The butts of pistols also stuck out of his holsters. His followers were similarly dressed. 
                  On seeing the young artisan he reined up and extended his hand. 
                  'Welcome, Corlears! What news bring you from the city?' 
                  'News I have been impatient to communicate, Captain,' answered the young man. 
                  'What hath happened?' he asked as he threw himself from his horse. 
                  'Last night under cover of darkness the Queen's Rangers under Lieutenant-Colonel Sincore, embarked from the battery for Staten Island. I was at the moment about to leave for the main to join you; having secured a buoy to swim over with; but discovering this movement I resolved to see what it led to. So, favoured by the obscurity, I got into one of the barges with the men and was landed on the Island!' 
                  'You run great peril!' 
                  'We must not stand for danger or risks in times like these, noble McLeod! To keep myself from being detected and at the same time attain my end, I had to use every precaution. I succeeded in ascertaining that their destination was Amboy: but further than that I was not able to learn. I then swam the narrow passage between the island and the main and an hour since arrived at your rendezvous, where your Bergen Woodsmen received me kindly!' 
                  'Heard you anything of Rivingstone?' 
                  Corlears then told him of the assistance he had afforded him and of his promise to join him. 'I expected to find him here when I came!' he added. 
                  'You are welcome, and you bring important intelligence. I wish Rivingstone had come with you! He may be here to-night. This movement of troops promises something ere many hours pass! But let us join our friends below!' 
                  'We began to fear you would not be here to-day, Captain,' said the tall yeoman who was second in command of the party. 
                  'I had to ride some miles further than I expected, to find the commander-in-chief. He assented to my wishes in reference to my command of you, but said he should consider me as a part of the army, and each of us responsible to him for our conduct in our operations. I gave him to understand that you were organised as a light corps, to keep watch upon the enemy's movements and act as sort of videttes of the main army, closely observing their movements, fighting when we chose, and doing the enemy all the mischief we could in our own way! I am to report to him once a fort-night; and beyond these restrictions we are free foresters! Has anything transpired during my absence, Saul?' 
                  'Nothing,' answered the tall Jerseyman. 'We stopped a woman with a baby on her back coming from the ferry.' 
                  'A woman?' 
                  'Yes, Captain,' answered the lieutenant, his bold, intelligent face slightly moved by an under smile. 'She said she had stayed in the city to take care of her house while her husband retreated with the army. But her house was burned in the conflagration, and that she had swam the river with a tub, putting her baby in the tub and she paddling beside it!' 
                  'That was a resolute woman!' 
                  'Yes, that she was. I set the example by giving her a dollar, and the rest o' the men gave her something, and so we let her pass on! There was a cannon or two fired in the city half an hour ago, but it was probably only some of the signals of the Britishers between themselves.' 
                  'We will take supper, my men, and then a dozen of you take horse and press towards Amboy by the forest roads. Watch the movements of the enemy on the opposite shore; and if you discover any demonstrations for crossing, despatch two of your best mounted men to me with the intelligence. You, Saul, will take command of this detachment. I shall remain here to hover about the ferry to see that there is no attempt made to make a landing from the city in this quarter, and if so communicate at once the information to the commander-in-chief, and defend the ferry till I am supported! If you neither hear nor see any movement of Simcoe's corps by morning, let me know!' 
                  The Captain of the Bergen Woodmen then seated himself upon the ground before a noble round of beef, and his men following his example, their rude meal was soon made. The lieutenant then chose his twelve men, and mounting at their head, the party followed at a round trot, leaving the 
                        biouvac
                        bivouac
                      by a bridle path that led southward. The negro having also supped, packed the remnant of provisions in panniers and placed them one side ready to be strapped with the other culinary apparatus upon the backs of three patient, strong-looking nags that were stuffing themselves with shelled corn a few paces distant, these with Scipio, representing the baggage and commisary of the corps. 
                  After Lieutenant Saul and his party had been gone some half an hour, Logan having placed his sentinels upon every commanding point, and left a sufficient guard at the rendezvous, he ordered the rest of his men to lie down and refresh themselves while they had leisure. He then called Corlears to him, and presenting him with a horse and uniform he invited him to accompany him on a ride of observation in the direction of the ferry. 
                  The road along which they cantered was without a traveller, for at such a time few were seen abroad save armed men. It was sunset when they reached the river-side opposite the city. The smoke of the evening gun still rested upon the water, and lights were beginning to shine in the windows and pencil the surface of the wave with long lines of fiery gold. The stars were reflected from the surface, and here and there in the distance it was darkened with the black hulls of the ships of war. The 
                        challange
                        challenge
                      of sentinels could be distinctly heard, and from one of the frigates came clear and sweetly the sounds of martial music mellowed by the distance. 
                  'This is all a fair scene, Corlears,' said McLeod. 'The day will come when we shall be masters, not only of yonder city, but all the fair land now held by our invaders! The sword of the God of Armies is with us; and this young nation of Freemen shall yet humble to the dust the haughty pride of England. Let us not despair, although they have taken our seaports. These they will not long retain. The land is gathering its strength, and a power they little know the existence of shall drive them from our strong-holds; and they will be glad to flee to their ships and spread their sails homeward to their own enslaved land!' 
                  'Yet our enemies are to be feared!-They have conquered the bravest European armies! They have brought France to terms, and Spain to submission. They come to us flushed with conquest, and experienced in arms! I must confess. I tremble for the result!' 
                  'I do not, my brave Corlears! But see! What comes this way upon the water?' 
                  There attention was now drawn to a dark object upon the river, which as it came nearer they discovered to be the head of a man swimming towards the landing. 
                  'Let us retire within the shelter of these trees and observe his movements,' said Logan. 'Whether he be friend or foe, we can arrest him at our pleasure!' 
                  The man reached the shore, and wading to the bank shook himself like a water dog, and then unbound from his head his jacket, which he had fastened upon the top of it to keep dry. 
                  'The man is a Jersey man, without question,' observed McLeod, regarding him closely. 
                  The man was undersized, thin visaged and dressed in an old leathern cap, yellowish or brick dust coloured trowsers, with a linsey-woolsey Jersey frock, or blouse jacket. His countenance wore an expression of mingled shrewdness and dullness. Having put on his frock, he took from the pocket of it a note, which after examining very carefully, he replaced saying. 
                  'By darn, but it did'nt get wet, did it, tho? It's as nice and dry as when she gin it to me. It was a purty tight swim that ar' tho, and I would not care about goin' back agin afore I'd liquored. If I had a pint o' the first proof Pennsylvany whiskey inside, why I'd float in water like a fish, would'nt I tho! Now I've got here I'd like pesky well to kno' how I am to find this Capting MacLeod, what has his quarters in the wood on the hill yonder? If I should fall in with any of his Bergen woodsmen, I should'nt wonder iv they put a bullet into me first, and then axe vot I comed for arterwards? It's mity pesky venturin' here, but I guess I'm a regular Jersey patriot, and Capting MacLeod 'll find it out by this letter!' 
                   
                  'That honest fellow has some intelligence for me, so we will ride out and meet him,' said Logan. 
                  The man on seeing two armed horsemen advance from the shadow of a group of trees by the Ferryside, started back, and looked as if he would take to the water for safety. 
                  'Ho, my man! Don't fly! We are friends!' cried Logan. 
                  'Friends or enemies, I spose you've got me complete,' answered the man doggedly, but without fear. 'If as how you belong to Capting MacLeod's corps, I ant pertikkler about meeting 'ye!' 
                  'If you would see Captain McLeod, I am he!' said Logan. 
                  'No, tho? Well what a circumstance aint it! Why you are the very man I want to see eenamost as much as I would myself if I had gone away a wisiten!' Do tell now! So you are Capting McLeod!' 
                  'Yes, and I will thank you for the note you have for me?' 
                  'You would, hey! Naow I'd like to know, if I was'nt too inquisitive, who in natur told you I had a note for you, Capting! 
                  'I overheard you speaking. Do not delay!' 
                  'Well now, there it is? I'll just make off home, if you say so, coz I've ben gone eenamost a week!' 
                  Logan took the note and by the fading light of day recognized with surprise the hand of Isabel Rivingstone. He tore it open, and read it as he sat in his saddle. It was as follows: 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 'DEAR LOGAN:
                               
                              'Withhold your surprise, and do not think me bold, until you have read the whole of what I am about to write. After your cruel departure, my brother came in, and finding me in tears, questioned me. I told him how you had left me, and what you had spoken. He approved of your course and deeply censured me. He then took leave of me saying he should join you. I retired, reflecting deeply upon my course, and asking myself if I could be right and you and Schuyler in the wrong! The next day I resolved to examine the subject and be convinced of the justice of your course if possible. I had just taken up Washington's published address to the army and other pamphlets, intending seriously to read them and hoping to be convinced, when a servant brought me a note from Schuyler. Judge my surprise when I read it! I copy it: 
                            
                            
                              
                                 'DEAR BEL:
                               
                              'You will be surprised to learn that I have joined Simcoe, and am now a hussar! You must not laugh at me. We all grow wiser every day we live! Did you ever imagine Simcoe could convert me to Toryism! Good bye! Send Pete to the barracks with my Bay!' 
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  'Can this be true?' exclaimed Logan, becoming at first deadly pale, and then his cheeks glowing with indignation. 'It is incredible. Heard you of this, Corlears?' 
                  'Nothing,' answered the young provincial. 'I did not see him in the corps. But it was night. Yet I cannot believe it!' 
                   
                  'What have you heard in the town of Schuyler Rivingstone?' demanded Logan of the man. 
                  'I heard he'd 'listed in the Queen's Rangers!' 
                  'You did?' 
                  'Yes; and what is more, I seed him in the ranks, coz somebody pointed him out, tellin' as how that was the man who was once a Whig, and had now turned kings' man!' 
                  'It must be true!' said Logan with anguish, 'Oh, Schuyler, how hast thou fallen! How hast thou deceived me! But let me see what Isabel may say in explanation!' 
                  'My first emotions,' continued Logan, reading the letter in a low voice, 'were those of joy and surprise. I felt I had now less motive in trying to convert myself, for I said, the next I shall hear will be that Logan has also returned to his allegiance!' 
                  'Never, Isabel, never!' exclaimed the young man with energy. 'Poor Rivingstone! I fear he has been won over to this step by the fascinations of that beautiful Tory, Grace Lee! The capture and imprisonment of her gallant father should now make a rebel of her. Never, Isabel, never will you find Logan McLeod a traitor to his country! Poor Schuyler!' 
                  'Elated by this news, I hastened to see Grace Lee, who my brother had told me only the day before had renounced toryism. As I supposed she had done so to win him, I now felt I could triumph over her! She could not see me then, being quite ill, but this morning she called on me. You know we have been as sisters to one another. She made me her confidant and from her I learned that her conversion was owing to the imprisonment of her father by the British. She spoke bitterly against the king and his cause. When I told her she would now have to become a tory again as Schuyler had become one, she impulsively resented this charge against him; but as if reflecting that she 
                        ight
                        might
                      betray herself, she instantly said-"He may not always be a tory." 
                  'From her manner I was satisfied there was some mystery. I at length succeeded in getting at the truth; and it is this that leads me to address you, Logan.' 
                  'This is all very singular,' said Logan, as he turned over the page of the letter; and as he read on his eye lighted up and his features expressed the strongest feeling and interest. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER VIII. 
                  THE COURIER. 
                  'THE statement which I drew from Grace,' continued Isabel Rivingstone, in her communication to the young Provincial chief, 'is that Schuyler is not a loyalist! That she, overwhelmed with grief at the fate of her father, pledged to him her hand in marriage in the face of all opposition on the part of her mother, if he would achieve his liberation from imprisonment, and save him from the death which she fears awaits him. He pledged himself to her to make the effort. He left her, and I know not from what fatal impulse or with precisely what plan, that very night joined Simcoe's corps of Hussars. The next day I learned the fact through the note which he sent me; and believed at the time that his conversion to the royal cause was real. But from Grace I learn that the evening on which the corps embarked, he called on her and in answer to her reproaches for thus turning traitor to the cause he had, hitherto, had so much at heart, and by his attachment to which she only had hope that he could effect her father's release, he replied to her that his object in joining the Hussars was for the very purpose of achieving her father's liberation. He told her that the corps were certainly to proceed as far as Amboy, and that there, under the guise and character he had assumed, he should be able to effect in his behalf what would be impossible otherwise. In a word, Logan, my brother has joined Colonel Simcoe only to bring about a treacherous end.' 
                  'Thank God!' exclaimed Logan with fervor, 'thank God! Schuyler is not then a traitor! But the peril of his situation is most imminent! I trust he will succeed and be saved from the danger to which his love for Grace has led him to expose himself!' 
                  '"You see, Logan, in what a fatal snare he has become involved by this rash step! Should his motive be discovered, should he even be suspected, his arrest, and an ignominous death of a spy will follow! I write to you to save my brother! It may not yet be too late! Grace knows nothing of my present act! She might be willing to risk the sacrifice of Schuyler to insure her father's safety! But I will not judge her! I condemn her for suffering him to go! for not firmly withdrawing her pledge to him! Schuyler, next to you, is most dear to me! I have thought what course it was best for me to take, and I resolved to address you. By accident, when I was leaving the house where Grace resides, I encountered a man who asked me if I was Miss Lee! I asked him what he wished, for he looked like a countryman, and I did not know but that he might be the bearer of some intelligence from Schuyler, supposing me to be Grace; he said that he had come for an answer to be taken back to Amboy. By artfully questioning him, I found that he was the man who had been the bearer to Grace of the news of her father's imprisonment of whom she had spoken to me. I desired him to follow me home. I then, by bribery got him to consent to seek you out with a letter I should write to you. The position you have taken up at Bergen Height is well-known here, and I felt sure he could soon find you! (And here let me caution you, dear Logan, against any sudden attack from this side; for you may be surprised in the night, and the party have time to reach the city again before the country could be effectually alarmed! You see I am half a traitor! I am willing to be wholly so, if you will extricate Schuyler from the consequences his mad passion for Grace will bring upon his head! I have to-day examined the arguments of Washington and others, and begin to suspect that the king may do wrong, and that you are right! I will be all you desire, an American woman, heart and hand, only do what you can to save my brother.) The man may serve you as a guide, should you decide on any movement. The Hussars are still at Richmond; but I am quite sure, from what I can learn, that they are to cross to-night to Amboy! Try and save Schuyler ere his treachery to the English be discovered, as it must; for it is impossible he should be able to effect the liberation of Major Lee from captivity. He will assuredly be detected in the attempt. 
                  '"I write in great excitement, and with deep emotion. I cannot advise you what to do; but among the various stratagems used in war, perhaps something may occur to you which will enable you to see Schuyler, or communicate with him, and deter him from prosecuting this wild and fatal scheme! 
                  '"Yours, faithfully, 
                  '"ISABEL RIVINGSTONE."' 
                  When Logan had finished this communication, he sat upon his horse some time, silent and thoughtful. At length he turned and addressed the man. 
                  'You are a Jerseyman?' 
                  'Yes, I guess I am!' 
                  'You are a true patriot?' 
                  'I'd like to speak with the man as doubts it!' answered the Jerseyman very positively. 
                  'What is your name?' 
                  'Mr. Simon Bean!' 
                  "Well, Mr. Simon Bean, I am much obliged to you for bringing this letter so promptly. Here is a guinea to learn you always to be faithful!' 
                  'I'll take the guinea, Capting, but it'd take a good many on 'em to teach me how to be honest to my country, if I hadn't larned nat'rally. Now, if you've done with me, I guess I can make a bee line for hum. 
                  'Do you live near Amboy?' 
                  'I guess I do, purty near there! I was born within a stuns' throw o' the meetin' 'us!' 
                  'You brought a letter from a person in prison there to Mrs. Lee?' 
                  'I guess I did! By darn, tho', I'd like to know how you get to know so much about what I do!' 
                  'It is so stated in this letter! 
                  'Well, if it's in writin' I expect it must be true!' 
                  'Did Major Lee give you the letter?' 
                  'No, he didn't; but it was giv' me by a couzin o' mine as is a Tory, and belongs to the guard wot keeps the pris'ners!' 
                  'I am rather surprised if you are a good citizen that you should be on terms with any of the loyalists, notwithstanding you may have a cousin among them.' 
                  'Well, the truth is, Capting, Josh has a darn'd purty sister, and I am her spark! So I don't like to get out with Josh, coz by-an'-by, when he sees how we are goin' to whip the Britishers like all time, he'll be comin' over to the right side agen; and he aint now more nor half a Tory. He's a good feller, is couzin Josh, and he thinks as how I'm 'bout as much a reg'lar Tory as he is!' 
                  'How came he to give you a letter from Major Lee?' 
                  'Well, you see the Major, you know, commanded the Cavalry; and one time he saved Josh's family, as are good Whigs, from bein' burnt out o' house an' home. Josh know'd this, and so when the Major wanted to write to his da'ter, he let him slyly have pen and ink, and then he comes to me and axes me iv I'd take the letter over to York! I told couzin Josh it was a plaguey risky plan for a feller to poke his head in, but seein' it was the Major, I'd take the letter. So I did, you see; and I put it in her own hand and told her I'd come agen the next night and take her answer back to the Major. Well, afore the next day was over I found as how, on account o' the burnin' o' the housen in the town, that if I didn't get away purty soon, I'd like to be cotched thar like a fox in a steel trap; coz the British General was publishin' a proclamation forbidin' every body to leave the island without a passport or take the konsekences. So I started on my way at onct to see the Major's da'ter, when I met a nice young lady comin', and says I to myself that's her sure enough. So I speaks to her, and she axes me who I was, and then tells me that she had a letter for me and I must go and get it. But when I comes to her house she tells me she isn't the Major's daughter, but she is her perticklar friend; and that I need not take an answer back to her father, but take a letter to you, which would be just the same. So I said it was all the same to me, and so I took the letter and came down to the river to see how I should get across. But as I couldn't find no ferryman, I just tuk to the water, and here I be; so now, Capting, you know a darned sight more about me than I know about myself!' 
                  'I am very much obliged to you for the knowledge,' said Logan, smiling. 'Now I have a question or two to put to you!' 
                  'I can answer 'em if they aint catechism questions. Them I has forgot ever since I was nine years old!' 
                  'You say you live in Amboy!' 
                  'I used to, but now I lives about a mile out, at Pig Marsh.' 
                  'You go in and out of the town at pleasure?' 
                  'Yes, I guess I can when I pleases. They don't know I ain't a Tory, I guess, there; and so I don't tell 'em my politics, coz it aint 'zactly safe when there's so many red-coats about. Besides, its convenient for a man to be on the fence these days if he aint a fitin' character, and wants to keep his head on!' 
                  'I understand you. 'Now, my good friend,' said Logan, 'can you describe the place of Major Lee's imprisonment?' 
                  'Well, I shouldn't wonder! Have you ever been to Amboy, Capting?' 
                  'Yes!' 
                  'Well, you knows the old jail then, I guess!' 
                  'Yes, I remember its situation perfectly! It fronts on two streets, and has a high fenced yard with a lane and open field on the two other sides!' 
                   
                  'It's true as the primer! Wall, the Major, you see, is in the North-East corner, upper story. One o' his windows looks out on the field, and the other down on the street and guard-house. He's put up there coz it is safest, and all the rest o' the cells is filled with prisoners!' 
                  'How many soldiers quarter in the guard-house?' 
                  'Wall, I didn't count 'em; but I guess on to about thirty!' 
                  'Where are the other British troops stationed in the town?' 
                  'Wall, there is a part of a regiment as has their quarters in the old meetin' 'us, and the tavern over agenst it; and there's a company as quarters in the distil'ry down by the river!' 
                  'None of them within a third of a mile of the jail?' 
                  'No, I guess its full that off!' 
                  'Corlears,' said Logan, addressing the young Provincial by his side, 'I have a plan in view for endeavouring to release Major Lee this very night! Three hours hard riding will bring us into the suburbs of Amboy. I want your co-operation!' 
                  'I am ready to perform any service that you may order me upon,' answered the young man promptly. 
                  'And you, my good man, you can serve me and your country to-night if you are a true friend to the cause!' 
                  'Wall, I guess I wont back out,' answered Mr. Bean with spirit. 
                  'I wish you to bear a note from me to Schuyler Rivingstone. He is with the Hussars on Staten Island, and will probably cross to Amboy during the night with them. Hasten to Amboy and wait there for the crossing of the Hussars. You will not be suspected and can mingle with the populace. Try and find Schuyler Rivingstone and place in his hands the note I shall give you!' 
                  'It's between twenty and thirty miles to Amboy, Capting, and it would take smart footing to get there afore morning!' 
                  'I do not mean you shall walk by any means. Spring up behind me and I will soon furnish you with a horse!' 
                  Mr. Bean did as he was requested, and settled himself upon the crupper to his satisfaction. 
                  'You, Corlears, I shall want to accompany him. Ride with him to the skirts of Amboy and there learn what you can of the movements of the Hussars and await my approach with the horse. I shall follow you at an easier pace than you will ride. If nothing transpires to render it expedient for you to fall back and report to me, let me find you at the Spring Head of the cross roads, a mile this side of Amboy. You will fall in with Saul, and give him my orders to wait my coming up. If, however, you or he should obtain any intelligence of moment touching the movements of the Hussars, do not fail to communicate with me that I may press on if necessary so to do. It is my intention to anticipate Rivingstone in any thing he may attempt for the liberation of Major Lee and so prevent him from falling a victim to his rashness; for how he can succeed without involving himself I cannot see!' 
                   
                  Logan now turned from the river-side and put spurs to his horse. He had not proceeded a hundred yards before he was challenged by two horsemen, who bounded from a thicket, and drew rein across his path. 
                  'The pass-word, or your lives!' cried one of the men, presenting a pistol. 
                  'Liberty and right!' answered Logan; and then immediately added, 'You are watchful videttes, my good men! You will have to keep long watch tonight, for I have a duty before me which will draw off the relief. Should you discover any attempt making to cross, you know your instructions. You will not spare spur till one of you reaches the main army, and gives the intelligence. Good night, my men!' 
                  Thus speaking, Logan pressed on at top speed, and after twenty minutes ride, reached the 
                        biouvac
                        bivouac
                      in the woodland at the base of the ridge. As he came near the place, he was also challenged as before. Here he unpacked writing materials from the baggage, and using his saddle, for a writing desk, wrote as follows: 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 'DEAR SCHUYLER,
                               
                              In the faint hope that this may reach you ere you make an attempt which will be almost certain to fail, and lead to your own sacrifice, I address you. Your motives in joining the Hussars, I know, and tremble at the consequences should you be discovered by the enemy. Your immediate execution would follow. You cannot leave the corps at Amboy without suspicion, whatever pretence you may urge. The English officers are especially watchful of the provincials who join them, and any thing that looks in the least out of keeping with zealous loyalty in your actions, or manner, will subject you to a close system of espionage. I regret exceedingly the step you have taken. The only way now, is to extricate yourself at once from your dangerous position. Make no attempt to liberate Major Lee. I am resolved to take this matter in my own hands, and Grace will be yours just the same! I think I can succeed, for I have a faithful and shrewd ally to whom also I entrust this. If he delivers this to you in Amboy, endeavor secretly to leave your corps, and follow him. He will conduct you to the Spring Head Cross Roads, a mile north of the town, where I shall rendezvous. Join me there, and co-operate with me, and together we will make a gallant attempt to release the gallant officer from his imprisonment. I shall have the confidence, my dear Rivingstone, to believe that you will attempt nothing rashly, but at once yield to the wishes of your friend. 
                              
                                 LOGAN MCLEOD.'
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  'This note you will endeavour to place secretly in the hands of Mr. Rivingstone,' said Logan, handing it to his messenger. 'In all probability the Hussars will have crossed to Amboy by the time you reach there. If he trusts to you, use all your skill to get him out of the town in safety and conduct him to the Cross Roads where you will find me. While you are in town make use of all your tact to know what is the service upon which the Hussars are destined!' 
                   
                  'I'll find out if I can get at it by askin' or guessin',' answered Simon Bean as he thrust the note into his shoe. 
                  'If you are in danger of arrest, you must destroy the note. It would place your head in danger if it was discovered upon you, as well as Mr. Rivingstone's!' 
                  'I reckon if I'm likely to be tuk, I'll feel pertikkerly hungry jist about that time, and see how letter paper tastes without salt!' 
                  'I see I can trust you! Now here is a horse. He is not very showy, Mr. Bean, but he is sure-footed and fleet. Scipio will have to divide his pack and place it upon the other beasts.' 
                  'I guess, Capting, if you'll just hand me up that ar' green poplar switch I can make him travel a leetle!' 
                  'You, Corlears, will remain at the Cross Roads, and let him enter the town alone. Now forward, my friends. As soon as I can gather my men I shall follow!' 
                  In a few moments the two horsemen had left the bivouac far behind them. Logan drew from his belt a small French hunting horn, and winding it loud and long, the sleeping Woodsmen around him started to their feet and sprung for their horses, and those stationed at the various avenues of the forest came riding in at a gallop. He was soon surrounded by three score brave men to whom he briefly said that they must mount and ride with him to Amboy. 
                  In five minutes afterwards the whole cavalcade was sweeping along the path at the foot of the ridge, Logan at their head. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER IX. 
                  THE LANDING. 
                  WE now return to follow the fortunes of Rivingstone. In attaching himself to Simcoe's corps he had weighed well the danger he incurred should he be suspected or fail ultimately in his object. The plan which he had formed was to withdraw from the corps after it should cross to Amboy, and, aided by his uniform, reconnoitre the prison in which Major Lee was confined; and avail himself of such opportunities as might offer to aid him in escaping. He depended almost exclusively upon the assistance he might have from the loyalist guard who had been the instrument of conveying the letter to Grace. 
                  To disarm all suspicion, he mingled freely with the members of the corps, and manifested before them a very becoming and praiseworthy loyalty. Some of our readers may ask if the course he was pursuing was not a dishonorable one for a right minded gentleman? To this suggestion the only reply we can advance is the military maxim that 'all is fair in war.' Nice points of morals are sadly blunted at such periods; and duplicity becomes a virtue. To kill a man in time of peace, is murder; in time of war, an heroic exploit. To deceive an enemy by subtlety and art is a great merit in a soldier, and the successful deceiver receives the approbation of his chiefs or cotemporaries. We are not defending our hero, nor do we condemn his course. Napoleon, who was a judge in such matters, and the head of the chivalry of Europe, in his day would have pronounced upon Rivingstone's course a judgment of approval. Rivingstone, who was really the soul of honour, did not feel that in deceiving Colonel Simcoe he was guilty of a dishonorable act. War, in his view, conferred honor on every species of strategy. But leaving this question of ethics to those whose province it is to decide such points, we continue our story. 
                  About seven o'clock, the evening after Colonel Simcoe landed on Staten Island, he removed from his encampment at Richmond, and moved along the road by the water side to a point opposite Amboy. The infantry of the Rangers were already there, drawn up on the shore under arms. The barges and floats for transporting them across, darkened the beach. At eleven o'clock the Hussars began to make the passage of the strait, and debarked at Amboy. The infantry under Major Armstrong crossed lower down, at South Amboy; a point of landing about a mile southward of Perth Amboy, and on the opposite side of the mouth of the Raritan. The order of the night was for Armstrong to march two leagues in the interior and take a position at a bridge, in order to cover the movement of the Hussars, and intercept any parties of the Jersey militia that on his retreat, after accomplishing his object in destroying the boats, might attempt to cut him off from Amboy. 
                  The whole plan was wisely and skillfully laid. On account of some delay in collecting the necessary number of boats, it was past midnight before the whole corps landed and assembled on the level area in front of the town. When the line of horse was fully formed, Colonel Simcoe calling his officers around him, told them of the destination of the corps: 
                  'Gentlemen,' said the officer, 'on the success of our present enterprise will depend in a great measure the security of New York. The Americans have collected, about thirty miles up this river, at a place called Van Vacter's Bridge, a number of boats which they contemplate conveying on wheels, and launching in the waters of New York, for the purpose of invading the city. I mean to make a forced march upon this point, burn the boats, cross the Raritan and return by the way of Brunswick. I shall by no means enter that town, but when I come near it, make a circuit and show myself on the heights in the rear. General Lexington, who is there with a regiment of the militia, will pursue, and I shall retreat for South Amboy. The militia will follow and fall into the ambuscade which Major Armstrong, with the infantry, will lay for them two leagues above. We shall thus have the satisfaction, not only of destroying the boats of the enemy, but defeating their pursuing detachments, and perhaps, take not a few prisoners! The parole for the night's enterprise will be CLINTON AND MONTROSE." 
                  The place in the ranks held by Rivingstone, was so near Colonel Simcoe, that he, as well as those around him, heard distinctly the orders given; for this officer did not speak so as to prevent any of the Hussars hearing his words if they chose to listen. 
                  This intelligence of the destination of the corps filled Rivingstone's mind with the most anxious solicitude. He knew how much Washington depended upon these boats for the success of his operations against New York; and that their destruction would materially change the aspect of the present campaign. In the higher considerations of his country, he for the moment forgot the captivity of Major Lee; his heart being with the American army, and his prayers were offered up that they might get intelligence of the expedition, and defeat it. 
                  'Now, my men,' said Colonel Simcoe, 'you may all dismount for ten minutes, refresh yourselves from your canteens or at the Ale-House. You will, each of you, be furnished with a hand grenade by Cornet Spencer, whom you will find there where you see the two lanterns upon the bow of the barge! Every other man will also be supplied by him with a hatchet in addition to your usual arms. In ten minutes I shall sound to horse!' 
                  The men dismounted; and each leading his horse by the bridle, either held in his hand or slung across his arm, they crossed the square; some going to the Ale-House, others to the barge to receive their hand-grenades and hatchets; while others grouped together, began to uncork their well-filled canteens, and take heavy draughts at their contents. 
                  Rivingstone feeling that he could do nothing towards arresting the contemplated destruction of the flotilla, took this opportunity to endeavor to withdraw himself secretly from the corps. That he might be seen among them to the last moment he went into the Ale-house and lingered an instant, and then came leisurely out. 
                  'You don't drink, Rivingstone,' said a young loyalist whom he knew; 'suppose we pledge each other!' 
                  'I have not my hand-grenade yet. I must get that you know, Mr. Elwell,' he said smiling. 
                  'I have mine and mean to kindle a rebel boat with it too,' replied the loyalist as he passed into the Tavern. 
                  'Wall, I guess this is Mr. Rivingstone,' said a voice close at our hero's shoulder. 
                  Schuyler turned, and by the light of the tin lamp, saw a countryman standing by his side, but with his face turned partly away and no expression upon his features which would lead Rivingstone, to suppose that it was he who had spoken. But no one else was so near. 
                  'Did you speak?' he demanded. 
                  'I should't wonder. Just step out o' the light, and I guess I have a word to say to you.' 
                  Rivingstone followed him into the shadow of the stoop, and the man stopping, said. 
                  'I am the individual what tuk a letter to Miss Lee from the Major.' I tell you this so we may understand one another off-hand, being we are strangers. 
                  'You have my full confidence.' 
                   
                  'Wall, then I'd advise you to back out o' the scrape with the Rangers soon as you can convenient, coz you must grow shorter instead o' taller some day afore you know it. A man's head when its on his shoulders is worth as much as a foot-ball I guess.' 
                  'Well what have you to say? What do your hints mean?' 
                  'Wall, here's a letter I was told to give you from Capting Logan. If you want to read it, just step to that little back parlor-window o' the tavern where you see that ere candle shinin'. You'll have to be pesky quick. When you've read it just tell me what you'll do. I'll wait here.' 
                  Rivingstone took the letter and went to the window in the end of the wing of the 
                        honse
                        house
                     , and by the light of a candle shining through the window he read the communication of his friend. 
                  'Wall, what do you think, squire?' questioned Simon Bean, as Rivingston approached him folding up the letter. 
                  'That I will do as Captain McLeod wishes,-leave the corps. But I can't quit Amboy without having seen Major Lee.' 
                  'There's the trumpet tooting. Now the two men as is each side o' you in the ranks 'll be sure to miss you if you leave yourself out. 
                  'That is true! This did not occur to me. I will ride with them after they commence their march, and take an opportunity to fall back.' 
                  'I'll tell ye a better way than that. That's your horse aint it, you fastened there?' 
                  'Yes.' 
                  He's mighty spirited and mettlesome, aint he?' 
                  'Yes, he has fire enough in him.' 
                  'You aint easily thrown off, be you?' 
                  'No,' replied Rivingstone with a smile. 
                  'Wall then, suppose arter you fall in line jest use one rowell o' your spur a little ugly, and put a bit o' divil in your horse. It stands to reason he'll rear up and plunge, and make a regular muss. The more you try to get him in line with your bit, the worse you'll make him back out of it with your spur. Jist make him right mad and serreptitious, and when you can't hold him in no longer, just let him run away with you. I reckon afore you can stop him the Colonel 'll be tired o' waitin', and wont wait to see if you or your horse breaks his neck. There goes the tootin' horn agen.' 
                  'I thank you for your advice, my good friend.' 
                  'I don't ax nothin', squire. 'I'll be round the other corner thar! When you've done runnin' away you'll find me thar!' 
                  Rivingstone mounted his horse, and as he leaped into the saddle he spurred him suddenly with such force that the animal leaped ten feet forward. The bugle sounded to line, and Rivingstone took his place, but his horse maddened by his active spur, plunged and endeavored to throw his rider. The fierce struggle continued for some minutes after the hussars were in line. The order to form column was delayed, that the restive horse might be subdued by his rider. The other horses began now to show restiveness. Colonel Simcoe was about to order Rivingstone to fall out of line and break his horse, when our hero applying his rowels smartly, the animal dashed furiously forward at winged speed, and soon disappeared in the darkness. 
                  'Fall in column! Forward!' cried Colonel Simcoe with impatience in his tones. The other officers echoed the order, and the whole troop of cavalry wheeling into marching column and 
                        preceeded
                        preceded
                      by six mounted Jersey-men as guides, passed out of the town at a smart trot; the thunder of their hoofs shaking the very streets. 
                  'Well, squire, that's what I call a purty good run away,' said Simon Bean in a tone of commendation, as Rivingstone drew up at the lonely corner, where he stood a quarter of an hour after the cavalry had left the town; 'I wonder whar you larned to ride a-horseback? By darn, I wouldn't ha' been in that ere saddle if you'd ha' given me the horse wot is under it. Them is mighty sharp spurs you wears, I guess." 
                  'Now, my good friend,' said Rivingstone, as he threw himself from his horse by his side. 'I wish you to show me the prison in which Major Lee is confined.' 
                  'I guess I can do that ere without travelling out o' my way; but aint you goin' to 'bey Capting McLeod's orders, squire?' 
                  'I must first reconnoitre the prison. I will see what chance there is of getting the American officer out, and then I will go with you to the Cross Roads. I am desirous of seeing Logan at once, to inform him of the destination of the British cavalry; and let him give the alarm to the country.' 
                  'Well, I guess you'll get to see him purty quick.' 
                  'I wish you to show me the prison, and then leave me, and go to Captain McLeod, and tell him on what expedition the corps have started. Tell him their destination is Van Vacter's Bridge, to burn the flotilla there.' 
                  'I'll do it,' answered Simon, with resolution. 'Now, jist fasten your horse right in there, among them elder bushes, by the side o' the road, coz we shall have to come back this way to go to meet Capting McLeod." 
                  Rivingstone secured his horse in a clump of low bushes, quite out of the sight of any one passing the wood, and then followed his guide into the town, on the outskirts of which they had been talking together. 
                  'Keep jist behind me, squire, and don't make a rattlin' with your chains and 'coutrements, coz you might be heard, you know.' 
                  'Simon passed on at a quick, steady pace, until they came to the corner of four streets. Three of them were silent and dark. The fourth had lights in the distance, and the figure of a sentry could be seen passing up and down the walk. 
                  'You don't know whar that light is, I guess, squire?' asked Simon, in a subdued tone. 
                  'No.' 
                  'It's hangin' right over the guard-hus door. That man you see there with the light gleamin' on his musket is the sentry to the guard what keeps the prison. That long black lookin' building right opposite is the prison. If you look sharp, you'll see another sentinel walkin' in the dark, right under the prison walls. That is where the gate is.' 
                   
                  'I see him and the prison distinctly. Which is the quarter in which Major Lee is confined?' 
                  'Wall, if you'll walk down this cross street a bit, I'll show you the window as well as I can in the night.' 
                  Simon turned short to the left, and led the way down one of the transverse streets for about fifty yards, and then turned into a narrow lane. 
                  'This lane, you see, squire, goes right by the back wall o' the prison. Come a little grain furder along, and you'll see the window. Its that ere corner one what looks over this way.' 
                  Rivingstone advanced with caution until he came as close under the window as the wall of the prison would admit, and after closely reconnoitering its position, he said to the Jersey-man- 
                  'My good friend, can you climb well?' 
                  'Well, I guess I can. I larned when I was a boy, coz father had no apples, and I had to pick 'em off the neighbors' trees.' 
                  'That window is not more than fourteen feet from the ground. There is no sentinel on this side. The street wall on the front prevents him from seeing this way. I have two files in my pocket, which I want you to convey to Major Lee through that window. I saw in the lane a pile of boards. By placing one of these against the side of the prison, perhaps, with my assistance, you might reach the window." 
                  'With your assistance, and that of a guinea, I guess I might.' 
                  'Well, there is the guinea. Now let us have the board placed under the window.' 
                  'The two men then proceeded to the pile of plank, and selecting one of the largest, they placed it against the yard wall, which was about nine feet high. By its aid both of them got upon the wall and down into the yard. Their situation was now very critical, as the least noise would draw the attention of the sentry, who was on the street in front, and not twenty yards distant. They now transferred the board from the wall and stood it up against the side of the gaol, directly under the window of the cell in which Major Lee was confined. 
                  'Now, my man, reach the window as noiselessly as a cat. I would go up but for my military boots and accoutrements, which might betray me, as well as render the climbing impossible. Take these two files, and tap on the grate of the window lightly. Call on his name "Major Lee," in a whisper. When he hears you, tell him you have two files, and throw them up, so that they shall fall on his coat. Remember, he is chained to the floor, and cannot come to the window to take them. Tell him to be expeditious and free himself from the floor, and then remove the bars of his cell, and that as soon as he opens a passage, to let himself down the walls of his prison, where he will have friends to receive him. We must save him, my good man, for ever since I have been with the Hussars, I have learned that he is condemned to be shot.' 
                  Simon took the files in his teeth, and slipping off his shoes crept up the board like a cat, and reaching the window, grasped the iron bars to sustain his weight. He tapped upon the stone frame work, and repeated the captain's name in a low but distinct tone. 
                  The reply was a sudden quick movement of chains within, as if the prisoner had been startled from his sleep. 
                  'Don't speak, Major! Friends are at hand. Here's a couple o' files, and you must make quick work with em and cut them darned chains in two quicker! I wish I was inside thar to help ye! I am the indiwidual wot tuk the letter to your da'ter. She's well and has sent Mr. Rivingstone and Capting McLeod to get you off. All you've got to do is to get your irons off, and then file away these bars. When you get 'em cut in two, jist let yourself down, and you'll find a plank under your feet, and friends to receive you!' 
                  'Thanks, thanks, my brave friend!' answered the deep voice of the prisoner. 'Give my thanks to Mr. Rivingstone and McLeod, and tell them that I will do my best to join them as they wish! Tell them, however, not to put themselves in any peril of life, or person!' 
                  'Don't fear, Major! I guess we know purty well wot we're bout! If you can only get out o' this window afore its daylight, you are as safe as a boy up in the top of a poplar tree, vhen a bull is a roarin' at the foot of it!' 
                  'Now, my good fellow, Simon Bean,' said Rivingstone after they had once more got out into the lane, 'let us seek McLeod! If he is but a mile distant, I can have an interview with him, and return before Major Lee will have freed himself from his irons, and opened the passage of his window!' 
                  'It's now two o'clock and arter', and its a good two hours job for a blacksmith, wot he's got to do; but a man as works for his liberty is apt to put to it considerable quick!' 
                  'Mount behind me,' said Rivingstone as he leaped into the saddle. 
                  'Wall, I don't care if I do. This'll be the second ride I've got to-night double-jaded.' 
                  'Which road do I take to reach the cross-roads?' 
                  'Right afore your horse's nose, squire!' 
                  They had rode out a few minutes when they were challenged by one of the sentinels stationed at the avenues of the town. 
                  'Clinton and Montrose,' answered Rivingstone. 
                  'That won't do,' responded the soldier. 
                  Rivingstone then explained that he was one of the Hussars, as his uniform proved, who had been detained by the running away of his horse; and that Simon was his guide. This explanation satisfied the man, who suffered them to proceed without further interruption. 
                
                
                   
                  CHAPTER X. 
                  THE RESCUE. 
                  THE Captain of the Bergen Woodsmen, had reached the Cross Roads a little after midnight. He had learned from Corlears as well as from his Lieutenant Saul, of the landing of the Hussars at Amboy. Halting with his whole troop, which his first detachment had now joined, beneath a vast sycamore tree that grew above the Spring Head, he anxiously awaited the return of Simon, whom Corlears had left at the skirts of the town, to let him enter it alone. Simon had been gone now full two hours. Logan had ridden several times forward from his post towards the town, and almost within hearing of the sentinels, to watch for his return that he might obtain some intelligence of Rivingstone. 
                  'It is strange our man delays so,' he said to Corlears after having ridden almost through the streets of Amboy with him, and then turned slowly back. 
                  'I left him at this spot, and there stands his horse tied where he fastened him to go into the streets on foot!' 
                  'The cavalry that landed, and which were a little while since heard thundering off along the western road, must be followed. I am half inclined to leave Rivingstone to carry out his own measures. The country should be roused; for Simcoe has not landed at Amboy in the night, and left it before day for the interior without some bold object in view. Be assured he meditates a sudden blow upon some defenceless point in this vicinity! If we hear nothing from our guide within the next ten minutes, I shall put myself at the head of my corps of Bergen Woodsmen and dash on in pursuit of the Hussars, and learn the meaning of this midnight foray!' 
                  While he was yet speaking, the challenge of the mounted sentinel to Rivingstone, as he came out of the town, reached their ears; and while they were looking to see who approached, the young hussar dashed past them, as they stood partly obscured by the hedge. 
                  'Rivingstone!' called Logan, as he recognised the tall hussar cap, as the rider passed him. 
                  On hearing his name, Rivingstone reined up, and Logan and Corlears advanced to meet him. 
                  'Is it you, Logan?' asked Rivingstone, with a glad exclamation, as they came near. 'I thought I recognised your voice.' 
                  The two friends grasped each other's hands with warmth. 
                  'I am glad to see you safely escaped, my dear Rivingstone, from the great danger you placed yourself in,' said Logan, earnestly. I have feared the worst from your rashness.' 
                  'I know it was a perilous position; but what would I not do for such a prize in view. You must know that dear Grace-' 
                   
                  'Yes, I know all the circumstances. Grace made Isabel a confidant, and Isabel, in despair, wrote me to save you, if I valued her love. Nay, she half pledged herself to become a good Whig, if I would extricate you in any way from the great danger in which you had involved yourself for Grace, whom she was disposed to quarrel roundly with for thus risking your life.' 
                  'I trust we shall yet both be rewarded with the realisation of the dearest wishes of our hearts, Logan; but meanwhile there are important matters that call for our immediate action.' 
                  'And of them I was about to ask you. You of course crossed with the corps of Hussars, and perhaps know their destination. They are bent on mischief and must be looked after.' 
                  'It is to this end I have hastened to you. You are aware of the flotilla Washington has been collecting at Vacters Bridge. 
                  'Yes, and on which we depend for the re-possession of New York. 
                  'Colonel Simcoe has volunteered to destroy it. This is the destination of the two hundred and fifty horse that half an hour since passed out on the western road.' 
                  'Can this be possible? Yes, it is an enterprise such as Simcoe would delight in, and he is just mad-cap enough to undertake it. It is impossible he should effect his object.' 
                  'He will succeed, I fear. The enterprise has been secretly planned. The precise destination of the corps was not known until an hour since. The American troops are chiefly at Brunswick, which he will avoid by making a circuit. He will reach the place within four hours, for his success and ultimate security depend upon the celerity of his movements. His intentions are to ascend the river by one bank, and after firing the boats, cross the bridge and descend by the other. The country of course will be roused first on the side by which he advances, and will look for him to return the same way. In the meanwhile Major Armstrong with a large force of the Ranger Infantry is slowly marching up the south bank of the river to cover his retreat and ambuscade the roads by which the militia may try to cut him off from getting back to Amboy.' 
                  'It is a bold attempt,' said Logan. 'It must be defeated. I have seventy well-mounted men two hundred yards from this place. By taking the bank of the river up, we can press on towards the bridge, and reach it before them, at the same time giving the alarm to the country as we dash through it. Let us spur and join my backwoodsmen; and then press forward to get the advance of Simcoe. But it will not do for you to ride with us in your Hussar uniform; for, should we fall in with the enemy unawares, and should you fall into their hands, they would be sure to give you short shrift.' 
                  'You forget the object I had in view, my dear Logan, in assuming this disguise and character. I cannot quit Amboy without Major Lee.' 
                  'The individual must be forgotten in duty to the country.' 
                  'True: but when we can serve both at the same time, we should do it!' 
                  'Have you seen Major Lee?' 
                  'Yes, and by the aid of this honest fellow, whom you sent to me, who pointed out his prison window, and climbed to it by means of a plank; the Major is at this moment filing the bars of his cell, and only waits for friends to receive him on the outside.' 
                  'Is his liberation so far achieved? You have done well, Schuyler.' 
                  In a few words Rivingstone narrated to his friend how he had succeeded in being left behind by his corps, and the steps which he had subsequently taken towards the liberation of the American officer. 
                  'It is a pity,' said Logan, that he should not now be seconded in his efforts. But every moment is precious. Every second we delay here, Simcoe is bounding on at the head of his cavalry!' 
                  At this crisis they came upon the Bergen Woodsmen, who were seated upon their horses in line, their hands upon their bridles, and ready to ride at a moment's warning. 
                  'You see my gallant fellows! with their aid I can give Simcoe trouble, and perhaps defeat his intention. I have no time to give to any secondary consideration. You must excuse me, my dear Schuyler: but the flotilla must be saved; or if Simcoe burns it he must be taken before he can reach Amboy again!' 
                  'I know the importance of the service. You shall not delay for me! How many men have you?' 
                  'In all, seventy one!' 
                  'Can you spare me twelve?' 
                  'Yes!' 
                  'And a led horse?' 
                  'Yes!' 
                  'With these I can effect my object. Ride on after Simcoe, as soon as you will! I will follow you in half an hour's time, with a rider in the empty saddle you let me have!' 
                  'You do not mean to storm the prison?' 
                  'No. But I mean to save Major Lee at all risks. The guard on duty consists of a detachment of thirty men. None of them are mounted. Major Lee's prison window is at a side which the sentinel does not watch. There is risk, nevertheless, that in the descent from the window, as it is now just beginning to dawn, that he may be discovered; for there is a yard to cross and a wall to scale before he can reach the horse we provide for him. If I am alone, and he should be discovered, we could not get off, and he would be re-taken! With a dozen well-mounted men I could easily cover his escape, even in sight of the guard-house, and be far beyond the town before any effective means could be taken to pursue us. The pursuit would not be far at least, for the British soldiers know too well the animosity of the country people to venture far from their defences!' 
                  'Your plan is a good one, Rivingstone. I can spare you the dozen men easily. If you succeed, ride on and overtake us. I wish you success, and that ultimately you will win the fair prize for whom you have risked so much!' 
                  The twelve men were then detailed from the corps and placed by Logan under the command of Rivingstone, with instructions to be guided by him, and to obey faithfully his orders. He then formed the remainder of his gray-mounted Woodsmen into column, and the two parties separated, moving in opposite directions, and were soon lost to the sight and sound of each other. 
                  Rivingstone advanced rapidly toward the town, and on coming up with the sentinel, replied to his challenge, 
                  'Hussars!' 
                  The soldier, before he could ascertain whether they were foes or friends, found himself seized, gagged and bound. 
                  The horsemen then rode on, guided by Simon, who had mounted the horse with which Logan had furnished him the earlier part of the night. He also had the spare charger which Rivingstone had obtained for Major Lee. 
                  They reached the rear of the prison by a circuitous route along the hedgerows. The day was just breaking. Rivingston concealed his troop by ordering them to dismount and remain beyond the hedge. 
                  On coming near the prison, he saw that Major Lee had removed the bars and was looking from the window. By a signal with his hand, Rivingstone drew his attention, for it was now quite light, and then by signs he directed him to descend. Simon in the meanwhile, was round on the street, drawing the attention of the sentry from the spot by offering to sell his horse, which he pretended to have picked up astray. 
                  Major Lee reached the ground and ascended the wall undiscovered. But descending on the other side, the board broke with his weight, and the noise drew the attention of the sentry, who, looking that way, saw Rivingstone and his party, who had instantly mounted their horses. 
                  The soldier fired and gave the alarm to the guard. Simon calling out 'By darn! if there an't a prisoner 'scapin' out o' gaol,' whipped up his horse, as if to ride round to intercept him. 
                  It was three or four minutes before the guard were drawn out, by which time Rivingstone, with Major Lee riding at his side, and surrounded by his dozen of brave men, were dashing at full speed out of the town. The volley fired by the soldiers did no other harm than taking off the tip of Simon's ear, for which grievous wound he drew a pension till within a year or two back, when he was gathered, with the tales of his warlike deeds in the Revolution, to the graves of his fathers. 
                  The result of Colonel Simcoe's bold expedition is a matter of history. He succeeded in executing his plan, and destroying all the boats with fire. But on his retreat the whole of the country was up in arms. Below Brunswick he fell in with Logan and his Bergen woodsmen, with whom he sustained a sharp action, and was forced to retire with precipitation, broken into several detachments. At the head of one of them was Colonel Simcoe, who in spurring along the high-way, fell in with Logan and his small party, with Major Lee under escort. After a brief struggle the British colonel of hussars was taken prisoner, and his corps, though successful in the object of their expedition, reached Amboy, without a leader and in confusion. 
                   
                  The further progress of the military events of the period, belongs to history. The success of Rivingstone in liberating Major Lee from his captivity, was rewarded as he wished. Grace in a few weeks afterwards redeemed her pledge. 
                  Isabel became a good Whig and the bride of our young chieftain of the Bergen woodsmen, whose further gallant deeds we leave to some future novelist or historian. 
                
               THE END. 
             
             
                
               THE YOUNG SCULPTOR. 
               BY MRS. ELLIS. 
                
                  CHAPTER I. 
                  "MY good fellow," said a young man, who had the appearance of being a recent traveller, "can you tell me which is the house of Steinberg, the sculptor?" 
                  "That there," replied a porter, pointing over the way toward an irregular range of buildings which formed a line of tenements along one of the great roads leading in and out of London. 
                  "That there?" muttered the traveller to himself, as he stepped back a few paces; and a feeling of chagrin was depicted in his countenance, as he looked again at the premises with a scrutinizing eye-"I thought," he continued, in the same under-tone, "that my father's friend had been more eminent in his profession than this establishment would warrant me to suppose." He rang the bell at the outer gate, however, in a manly and determined manner, and was soon ushered into a small apartment or studio, in which Steinberg, the sculptor, was accustomed to receive those who wished to communicate with him on affairs of business. This apartment belonged not to the dwelling-house, though it communicated with it, but looked directly into a yard, where some half dozen workmen plied their busy tools, and where blocks of marble, and heaps of plaster, with other disjointed fragments of stone, ancient and modern, rough and smooth, lay in apparently confused masses, from which the hand of a Venus, or the forehead of an Apollo, with various other portions of the material sublime and beautiful of past ages, might be detected by the curious and observant eye. 
                  In the small apartment above described, scarcely deserving a higher designation than that of a workshop, sat the sculptor himself, whose appearance, to a casual observer, was as if his nature had assimilated itself to the material on which he worked-so cold and dry, and apparently unchangeable, was the general aspect of his face and figure. Still the outline of his countenance was fine, and when the velvet cap he usually wore was removed, and his hair fell 'in natural waves over his noble brow and temples, there was a sort of Roman dignity about the man, of which every one appeared to be sensible who approached him, and especially those who might by any mischance have advanced too near. The figure of Steinberg, too, was majestic and commanding; and not even the loose gray coat in which he was usually enveloped, could conceal the promptness and facility of his movements. 
                  "My father," said the young man, attempting to tell his story- 
                  "Your name, if you please, sir, in the first instance," asked Steinberg very coldly-and then the youth remembered that although his handsome form and lineaments might be well known in the city of his birth, it was highly important that they should have some Christian cognomen in a land of strangers. 
                   
                  "Louis Montreville," replied the youth. 
                  "Montreville!" exclaimed the sculptor, holding out his hand, and looking at him with so piercing an expression that the stranger involuntarily shrunk back-"Ah! I see it all," he continued; "you are indeed the son of my old friend, and I must have been blind indeed not at the first moment of our meeting to have recognized the object of so much solicitude and affection. I have a letter from your poor mother, received, I think, two months ago, in which she expressed her hope that you would very soon be with us-I trust nothing in connection with her feeble health detained you longer than she anticipated?" 
                  "Oh, no," replied the youth gaily, "I left my mother at the time she expected, but having for the first time in my life felt perfectly at liberty to dispose of myself as I thought best, it was but natural that I should wish to see something of the new world upon which I was entering, before I resigned that liberty again." 
                  "It was natural," said Steinberg-but he made this concession with a contracted brow and lips compressed, as if a sudden suspicion had flashed across his mind that the youth was not all his fond mother had described him. 
                  "I don't like this old fellow at all-I shall never make anything of him," was the modest remark which the young traveller made to himself, on returning to his hotel, to dress for the family-dinner to which Steinberg had invited him; and had not repeated applications to his mirror, which of all his friends was most undeviating in its flattery, raised the complacency of the self-admirer to its ordinary level, it is more than probable some means would have been invented for obtaining at least a temporary reprieve from further intercourse with so uncongenial a companion as the sculptor. 
                  "I wonder whether there are any woman-kind about him?" said Louis. "Ah, yes; I am sure my mother said something about a daughter; but with that German-look, that gray complexion, and those dead eyes, one might as well sport one's good looks before a marble slab, as before a woman constituted after the fashion of old Steinberg. Still the girl, if there be one, must have a mother; and as people are said to affect their opposites, it is more than probable I shall see some merry little Dutch-broom girl seated at the head of her father's table." 
                  The youth, dressed in a suit of handsome mourning, soon presented himself again at the door of Steinberg, the sculptor; and this time he was ushered into the dwelling-house, and shown up-stairs, into a long room or gallery, lighted only from the ceiling, where specimens of art, both ancient and modern, mutilated and entire, were arranged on every hand with the most scrupulous regard to order as well as taste. 
                  It was one of the redeeming points of Louis Montreville's character, that he was an enthusiastic lover of the fine arts; and although this peculiar turn of mind is far from meriting the respect due to moral excellence, it proved, in his case, as it had done in many others, a means of preservation from vulgar folly, as well as from association with the ignorant and degraded. He was a genius, too, as might easily be understood from the lighting up of his countenance, from the fire of his wild eyes, and from the depth and tone of his expressions, whenever any subject was discussed which came within the sphere of his favorite range of thought and feeling. 
                  The impression made upon the mind of the elder artist by the appearance of his young friend, had been most unfavorable. He had thought him vain, presumptous, and consequently shallow; yet, as a son of a friend recently deceased, he had determined to show him every kindness which the situation of a widowed mother, left with the care of an only son, demanded of her husband's early associate, school-companion, and college friend. True genius, however, is always humble; and however confident and self-satisfied Louis Montreville might appear on ordinary subjects, no sooner was the theme of his deeper thoughts, the passion of his inner soul, made manifest, than his whole character appeared to be transformed. 
                  Under this metamorphosis he now followed his instructor from one end of the gallery to the other, listening, with the respectfulness and docility of a child, to all that might fall from the lips of one whom he regarded as having advanced far in a career of glory, on which he was himself just panting to set out. 
                  Steinberg, in his turn, looked again and again at his guest. Was it possible it could be the same?-that grave and earnest look-that reverential tone-that thrill of feeling, visibly vibrating through every nerve-whence came they? Yes, it is true that real genius is lowly and humble, even in its own distinguished walk; and natural and reasonable it is that it should be so, since what it executes must eventually fall so unmeasurably short of what it conceives. 
                  "I have not introduced you to my daughter," said Steinberg to his guest, on returning from the farther end of the gallery; and then, for the first time, Louis observed that a pale girl-almost as pale as the figures they were contemplating-had been seated on a low seat near the table at which her father worked. 
                  Magdalen Steinberg rose when her father pronounced her name, and a slight color passed over her cheek, to vanish in an instant, and leave it again as pale as marble. She was almost as motionless too; and the stranger looked again, to assure himself that she was a being endowed with life and motion; so perfectly classical were all the lineaments of her face and figure, so pure and still the character of her form and features. 
                  Magdalen Steinberg, left early without a mother, had become her father's chief and almost only care-the only being in the whole world upon whom he lavished that affection of which his heart was full, without enjoying those natural outlets which friendship and society afford to other men. From an intense love of his art, as well as from the pain of many disappointments, connected with the practice of that art as a profession, Steinberg had gradually learned to withdraw himself from all familiar association with a world most grossly, and in his opinion culpably, blind to the merits of an occupation which he esteemed at something more than its real value. As the practice of his profession had become the sole business of his life, and his success as a sculptor the only object of his worldly ambition, so his wife and child had occupied all that was tender and warm in his heart; and when one of these idols was taken from him, he only watched the other with more intense solicitude, and poured upon the head of his beloved child those floods of affection of which none would have believed him capable, who beheld only the cold exterior of the sculptor, when he mixed with a world, from which he studiously kept himself as separate as the circumstances of his life would permit. 
                  The mother of Magdalen was an Italian, with whom her father became acquainted while pursuing his studies in Rome; and it was from this parent that she inherited her almost perfect beauty-perfect of its kind; for beauty must ever remain to be dependent upon the taste of the beholder, and such was that of Magdalen, that few persons of ordinary character and feeling, whose ideas have been formed among the common affairs of life, would have thought her beautiful. Stillness, that often-wanted, often-wished for excellence in woman's character, was to Magdalen so habitual, as to have become almost a part of her nature; and hence arose a resemblance to the antique and marble beauties who had constituted almost the only companions of her childhood and her youth. 
                  There were few things on earth which the father of Magdalen disliked so much as the ordinary gossip of common female society. Could another woman man like his lost wife have been found, he would have esteemed her friendship the greatest blessing his daughter could enjoy; but believing, as he did, no such vestige of departed excellence remained on earth, he studiously repelled every attempt from relative or neighbor, however kindly meant, to penetrate within the sacred precincts of his domestic circle. Thus Magdalen was, perhaps happily for herself, as ignorant of the value of a friend of her own sex, as she was unconscious of such a want; and though her young heart yearned perpetually for something, she knew not what, she learned to be still, and even satisfied, so long as her father loved her, and was pleased with what she said and did. Her own words were few, almost too few to offend, even had they been less sweet and well selected than they were. Her father was in the habit of employing her soft and musical voice in reading aloud to him from the best poets of different countries, during his hours of labor; for while his hands were busily employed, and one train of thought necessarily engaged in what they were about, he was accustomed to enjoy, what he described as an under current of reflection flowing on like music to his soul; and never was this music so soothing, or so sweet, as when produced by the soft tones of his daughter's voice. 
                  In this dreamy and monotonous way, then, Magdalen had spent her time; and while she sat at her father's feet, with her head bent down, and her eyes fixed upon the book she read, with her long lashes falling in deep shadow upon her pale cheek, where the rose of natural and healthy childhood had never bloomed, she looked like a mere automaton put into gentle motion by a set of machinery with which individual feeling had no concern. No sooner, however, did the thrill of some touching passage, or warmth of some burning line, impart an additional glow to her complexion, than the true and sensitive woman might be read in every line and feature of her face. But especially when she looked up, when her father addressed her kindly, or when surprised into some sudden emotion by some startling truths; it was then that the soft and fawnlike eyes of Magdalen revealed what was in her nature, and in her heart. 
                  Prepared as Louis had been for the merry Dutch girl, with whom he had flattered himself he should be able to conduct a little flirtation unseen by the father, he was disappointed at first to find that the stillness and solemnity of the household were not likely to be broken in upon by any eccentric movements among the junior part of the family. Still there was too much of that beautiful ideal about the sculptor's daughter, upon which the young enthusiast had dwelt in dreams by night and day, for him to wish her otherwise than as she was; though he did think, as he sat down to the dinner-table, that one daughter like Magdalen to sit in the studio, and another merry little girl to talk to at table, would have been a great improvement in the Steinberg family. 
                  "Now sit down beside me," said the sculptor to his guest, after conducting him from the small and simple dining-room, a little earlier than the young man had expected, into an elegant apartment fitted up with the nicest adaptation to all the refinements of female taste. "Sit down beside me," he continued, "and tell me frankly all your wishes and your plans; and in the mean time we will drink our coffee, and Magdalen will take her harp at the other end of the room, and beguile me, as she always does after dinner, of half my cares, and of all my sorrows, if I happen to have any." 
                  "Had we not better give our attention to the music first?" said Louis, hesitating before he took his seat. 
                  A frown from the father's brow gave instant warning that this would not do; and unwillingly the guest was compelled to seat himself beside his host, at a very prudent distance from the scene of attraction. 
                  "What is Miss Steinberg's choice in music?" asked Louis, very naturally; when another frown from the father indicated that the less Miss Steinberg was talked about the better. 
                   
                  "We will now enter upon your business, if you please," said he. 
                  Louis therefore, who was always rapid and impetous in his thoughts and actions, did enter upon it in such a way, that his wishes were laid before his father's friend without reserve, with the plans he had formed for the prosecution of his studies as a sculptor, before one sound beyond the ringing of certain separate chords had been heard from the other end of the room. 
                  Perhaps one reason for this delay in the musician might be a very natural timidity in the presence of a stranger; for although she had always been employed to play and sing before her father, not to occupy, but to beguile him of his thoughts, she was not quite sure that another person would be equally absorbed. At all events, she felt as if the eye of a stranger was upon her, and in this she was not mistaken. 
                  "You have no wish then," said Steinberg, in the tone of a question, "to become an inmate of my family, while prosecuting your studies?" 
                  "Why, no," replied Louis, rather doubtfully, and glancing again at the lady and her harp, "It might not be so agreeable to either party. I confess I like liberty. I believe I like amusement too; and you seem quiet here, sir-very quiet." 
                  "We are quiet," observed Steinberg gravely, "and I hope and trust we may always remain so. There could be no arrangement made for your becoming one of my household, in the least degree satisfactory to me, which did not tend to maintain and preserve this quiet. You must therefore clearly understand the terms on which alone you could dwell with me, not as a guest, but as a son. In the first place, you must never be out after ten at night." 
                  "Oh! sir, that is impossible!" exclaimed Louis. "No young man binds himself to such an hour as that." 
                  "Very well, sir," replied Steinberg, "then we have nothing more to say on that subject. You will easily find lodgings elsewhere." 
                  At this moment Magdalen, being no longer able to find a chord untuned, began to play a bold and thrilling air, yet withal so light and free, that the thoughts of the listener involuntarily flew off to the camp of an armed host, to the tread of conquering soldiers, or to the rush of mountain winds, when they bring the notes of the wild bugle on their blast. 
                  "At ten, did you say?" inquired Louis, turning quickly to his host, when the music had ceased, "I will come home at nine every night if you please." 
                  "Young man," said Steinberg, very sternly, "take care what you are about. Promise me nothing that you are not prepared to do. Let peace and concord at least be between you and me, for the sake of your parent who is gone, and for her who still lives. The world is all before you. Choose where you please, but do not, by your rashness and folly, bring trouble beneath my roof. I know nothing of your habits; they may, for aught I know, be correct, or they may be far otherwise; but one thing you ought to be fully assured of, that if not such as I approve, you never can be one with me, or mine." 
                  "It would ill become me to boast," said Louis, "nor have I much cause. I suppose that my past life has been much like that of other young men; but what could be so likely to make me better, as to be admitted into the bosom of a kind family, instead of being turned adrift among strangers in such a place as your great city?" 
                  "You are right," replied Steinberg, "and be assured that nothing but consideration for your mother, and a strong conviction of the advantage it might be to you in a moral point of view, could induce me thus to risk the comfort of my family, by proposing such a plan." 
                  "Pardon me," interrupted Louis, rather indignantly; "if you think the peace of your family likely to suffer by my presence, I can have no wish to inflict so great a punishment upon you or yours. I withdraw my request, sir: I beg to withdraw it entirely. I feel that we should both be better satisfied to live separate." 
                  Louis had scarcely uttered these words, accompanied with every indication of that swelling dignity which he thought himself so richly entitled to assume, than there rose from the other end of the apartment, the low soft tones of the sweetest voice it had ever been his happiness to hear. It was a melody of no common order. The words were Italian, and the accompaniment sad and touching in the extreme. Steinberg was evidently moved; and drawing his hand across his eyes, he murmured, with half-closed lips, as if speaking to himself, "That was her mother's song." 
                  He said no more until the melody had ceased: but carefully shaded his face with his hand, as he leaned with his elbow on the table, as if unwilling that a stranger's eye should see how capable his feelings were of being shaken. 
                  "Let me live with you," said Louis, affectionately grasping his hand, as soon as the sound had ceased; "let me be to you as a son, and you shall be my father." 
                  "Young man," said Steinberg, looking earnestly in his face, "are you sincere?" 
                  "I am," replied Louis, still holding his hand. 
                  "Then be it so," replied the sculptor; "and when you know the value of the trust I repose in you, I think you will not be disposed to abuse it." 
                
                
                  CHAPTER II. 
                  BUT a few weeks had passed, before Louis Montreville felt himself thoroughly at home in the sculptor's family. It is true he did not like the stillness prevailing there, the early hours, the order, the dead calm, as he called it, in which the wings of his spirit were compelled to be folded and inactive; he did not like the distance at which he was kept from the only being who fascinated, and charmed him to the spot: but ever as his temper and his feelings rebelled against the restraint to which he was under the necessity of submitting, the harp of Magdalen beguiled him of the restless thoughts that would have driven him forth into the world; or some smile or tear awakened by the poet whose pages she was reading, convinced him that in her shrouded heart there was a mine of feeling more rich and deep than he had ever found, or even imagined, to exist in a woman. 
                  While the young sculptor was studying every day, and almost every hour, how to make an impression upon the heart of Magdalen, endeavoring to divert her by his vivacity, or to excite her sympathy by his pathos; sometimes when he had succeeded in attracting her eye, looking as he believed altogether irresistible, and watching the rose-tints which his looks or words had occasioned, deepening, and then fading away, upon her cheek-while all this idle and fruitless pastime was occupying the mind of the handsome youth, circumstances over which he had no control, were preparing for him a prouder triumph than his own merits, or his powers of enchantment could ever have ensured. 
                  The health of Steinberg had long been failing. A disease was preying upon his heart, with which none were acquainted but himself and his physician; and Magdalen, who had lived under her father's protection, as a lamb under that of a shepherd, was shortly to hear tidings of the possibility of this protection being withdrawn from her for ever. 
                  Never once until this awful communication was made to her, had it entered into the heart of the sculptor's child to dream of standing in the world alone; and when first the idea presented itself, she hung upon the neck of an old and faithful domestic, who had been her mother's nurse, with all the imploring weakness of an orphan child. 
                  It had been well meant by the father of Magdalen, when he determined within himself to keep his daughter unacquainted and unassociated with the world; but this very ignorance, while it kept her comparatively pure and simple, rendered her helpless and dependent in the extreme; so that of all living creatures to be left to struggle with the necessities of life alone, Magdalen Steinberg was the most unfit. But what was to be done? The disease crept on, and on, and nothing could arrest its course. It was not that Steinberg was poor; he had more than sufficient to supply his daughter's pecuniary wants; and he had an increasingly lucrative profession to bequeath to any one who might follow in his steps. Sometimes when alone, his thoughts involuntarily turned to the youth he had, for the sake of early friendship, almost adopted as his son. But no. The youth was highly gifted, enterprising, and almost certain to succeed if-if-. But here the father used to stop, and cast from him the unwelcome thought, as if never to be yielded to again. It did arise, however, almost perpetually, to the destruction of his peace of mind; for to him it was too evident what were, and would be, the nature of his pupil's temptations; and all his genius, with his personal and mental recommendations, only rendered the idea more repulsive and appalling. 
                  "If Magdalen should ever love this youth," the father would sometimes say to himself, "she will cast her happiness into his hands, without calculation, and without reserve." So, to prevent this calamity, he spoke against him in her presence, and he did this perhaps a little injudiciously, for by degrees the daughter began to think her father was unjust, and thus her sympathies became awakened for a stranger, a foreigner, of whom she thought her father judged harshly; and as he had no one else to take his part, she ventured sometimes to say, but still oftener to feel, that the youth had many excellences of character and disposition, which ought to be remembered, as well as his faults and eccentricities. 
                  There was one fault, however, or rather one tendency, for it had as yet scarcely assumed a more serious aspect, which awakened in the mind of Steinberg the deepest concern for his pupil's safety, situated as he was by the nature of his profession, among those with whom convivial meetings were not unfrequent, and whose pursuits were of a character to render the creations of an excited imagination almost necessary to supply the wants occasioned by indolence, and neglect of thought and study. Once, and only once, Steinberg had ventured to mention this tendency of the young sculptor's to his daughter; when the burning crimson which suffused itself over her face, told but too plainly how deep was the impression his words had made. 
                  Ignorant of the world as Magdalen from the circumstances of her situation naturally was, she had no idea of the mixture of good and evil, which is found in almost every human being. To her virtue was that sinless and immaculate state in which, from the partial descriptions of her father, she believed her mother to have existed; while, on the other hand, vice was vice in all its horrors. That Louis Montreville was a being fit to rank in the scale of morals with one, or even both her parents, she had not allowed herself to doubt, until the moment when his name was mentioned by her father in connection with a vice so degrading in all its features, so utterly loathsome, so irreconcilable in her ideas with every single trait or feature of moral excellence, that to believe him guilty here, was in her opinion to associate him with the lowest dregs of humanity, with those melancholy outcasts from social fellowship, from which in her occasional walks she had shrinkingly turned aside, as if from creatures of a different species from her father and herself. 
                   
                  "No, no," she said to herself a thousand times, not only when she fixed her steady gaze undetected upon the fine features of the interesting youth, but when alone in her own chamber; "Louis is a genius, a poet, a lover of the fine arts, an admirer of the pure and the refined and the beautiful. He can never be what my father says-no, never!" 
                  Louis, on the other hand, felt, that although enjoying in some degree the favor of his father's friend, and partaking in still greater measure of his kindness, he was gradually sinking in his esteem, and not without sufficient cause; for he knew better than any one else-better even than the old nurse, who sometimes, with silent step and uplifted finger, opened the door of her master's house to let him in at an untimely hour of night-he knew better than any one else could know, how far he was deviating from a course of life worthy either of his own approval, or that of his friends. Still he would reason with himself according to that dangerous mode of justification which pampered inclination maintains against wounded conscience. 'Still,' he argued, 'it was but natural. All young men did the same. It was impossible to endure his life cooped up in that narrow cage. His art could not flourish, his genius could not soar, without those seasons of refreshment and exhilaration which he enjoyed with his competitors for fame.' 
                  "Magdalen," said he one day, when, after Steinberg had left the room, the unconscious subject of his thoughts remained seated in the same position, and with her eyes still fixed upon the page she had been reading-"Magdalen do you believe all the bad things that are said of me, do you?" 
                  "Oh! no," said Magdalen, smiling, and looking up with the trusting simplicity of a child. 
                  It was a sweet confiding look, such as a cherub might wear while sheltered by an angel's wing; and Louis could not bear it, for it told him that he war a deceiver, and the next step to deception is injury. Not the bitterest of reproaches could have wrung his heart more than that trusting look; and with the sudden impulse of a generous nature he exclaimed- 
                  "Yes, Magdalen, it is all too true! I am as bad, and worse than they describe me." 
                  "I do not believe it." said Magdalen, again; but this time her voice was sad and low, and her eyes were rivetted upon the book she held in her hand. 
                  "Yes, Magdalen," continued Louis, "I am in the habit of mixing with lawless spirits, whose delight is in things which you abhor." 
                  "I do not believe it," said Magdalen again, but her voice was fainter than before. 
                  "Ask old Agnes," he continued-"ask how often she has crept down at my secret signal, and opened your father's door for me when he was asleep." 
                  "She has told me," replied Magdalen, "but I did not believe it." 
                  "But you believe it now?" 
                  "I believe it if you say so; but I believe also that you will do so no more." 
                  "No, Magdalen, you must not believe that. I am not prepared yet, though I hope I shall soon be, to give up everything which your father disapproves. There is one condition on which I would promise him this, or any other thing that he might require. Can you not guess what that condition is?" 
                  Magdalen answered not. Her face was covered with confusion: but her eyes were still fixed upon her book, while they filled with tears, which fell heavily upon the open page, until her cheek grew pale again, and her lips were white as ashes. At last she said, with a voice which trembled with emotion. 
                  "Do not bewilder me-above all do not deceive me. I have ever been accustomed to hear the simple truth spoken by the lips I love." 
                  "Magdalen," said Louis, "from this hour you shall hear the truth from me; but you must promise me one thing." 
                  "My father," murmured Magdalen-and that instant the door opened, and Steinberg himself appeared, happily for her, too much absorbed by his own thoughts to observe the emotion which was still visible in her countenance. 
                  And deep cause there was why Steinberg should think, and think seriously; for another interview with his physician had led him to relinquish all hope that his life could be prolonged beyond a very limited period. Whatever he had therefore to do in the settlement of his affairs, must be done quickly; and consequently he entered that very night into an examination of the state of his worldly circumstances, with a view of making over the property connected with his profession into other hands. It was but natural that Louis Montreville, who was rapidly rising in the practice of the art, to which from very early life his studies had been directed, should look with a prospect of succession; and in pursuance of this plan, his mother was consulted, and all other necessary steps taken preparatory to his future settlement as a sculptor on his own foundation. 
                  Thus all went on, and everything seemed to be taken into consideration, except the disposal of poor Magdalen. On this subject, her father felt as if it would be death to think; yet as disease pressed upon him, and the relative duties of parent and child grew more solemn, and more imperative, he compelled himself to ask his child what were her own wishes in regard to her future lot. 
                  "Tell me," said her father, "tell me frankly, my beloved child, what are the wishes of your inmost heart-it is of importance that I should know them." 
                  "I think it is agreed," said Magdalen, "that Louis takes your business, and continues your profession, in his own name?" 
                  "Yes, with this provision, that half the profits for the next three years shall be yours." 
                  "Yes, that is what he told me." 
                  "What I want to know then, is, where you would like to live, who you would like to have with you, and, in short, everything else connected with your happiness." 
                  "I should like to live here, of course, father; I never dreamed of any other home." 
                  "You cannot do that, my child; the house and all which belongs to it will be the property of Louis Montreville." 
                  "Then, father, I should like to be his wife, as he has asked me to be if-" 
                  "What!" exclaimed the father, in such a frenzy of astonishment, that his daughter started back; and well she might, for there wanted but a moment of excitement like this to accelerate the crisis of his fate; and in another, while Magdalen stood speechless and transfixed with horror, her father's features contracted into the narrow look of death, while his fine and manly form sunk lifeless at her feet. 
                  "I have killed him!" said Magdalen-when the door was opened by old Agnes; who, startled by her master's fall, had rushed up stairs-"I have killed my father!" she repeated; but still her eyes were tearless, and her quivering lips refused to utter any other explanation of the awful scene. 
                  This old domestic was, however, of all the members of the household, most capable of understanding the circumstances of the case: she had been warned by the physician that her master's death would be sudden; she knew the repugnance of the father to that one subject, upon which his daughter had so innocently touched; and she knew also the growing attachment of the young people to each other; an attachment which, while it occasioned her the deepest anxiety on behalf of her young mistress, she did not deem it safe to lay directly before her master, fearing the sad consequences which had now ensued. 
                  The tearless agony with which Magdalen beheld her father fall was such as a delicate frame like hers was but ill calculated to sustain, and long before her mind was in any degree restored to its accustomed tone, the last sad duties to the dead had been faithfully performed by her mother's nurse, under the direction of Louis Montreville, whose best feelings were called into exercise on this melancholy occasion, and whose real respect for his father's friend was shown in a sorrow as sincere and as deep as if he had wept a second father. 
                  No sooner was the ceremony of the funeral over, than Agnes, who felt herself Magdalen's sole protector, deemed it right to remove, with her almost senseless charge, to a distance from the familiar scenes of her childhood. For the benefit of a total change, she sought a retired and picturesque residence by the sea-shore, and here she watched, with all the assiduity of a mother, the returning health of the solitary orphan. 
                  "Do you think it was I who killed him?" were the first words which Magdalen uttered after her reason had partially returned; and then the good old nurse explained to her how it was that her father for a length of time had been hanging, as it were, between life and death, and that anything-the merest trifle in the world-which had the power to agitate him, might have produced the same awful consequences. 
                  "Not," said she, some weeks after this, when Magdalen had renewed the subject, and when her assurances to this effect had also been renewed, "that I wish to make light of your father's feelings with regard to that young man; for indeed, indeed, my dear young lady, he is every way unfit for you." 
                  "But, Agnes," remonstrated Magdalen, "he is very kind." 
                  "The kinder, the more dangerous," replied Agnes. 
                  "I think my poor father judged him hardly," said Magdalen again. 
                  Agnes shook her head. "Your father knew, and I knew, and he knows too, that he is not a safe man to have the keeping of a woman's happiness." 
                  "But you forget, Agnes, that he has neither mother nor sister to watch over him; a wife would supply the want of both-and I would be so careful of him." 
                  "My poor dear creature, what would you do?" 
                  "Oh, I would love him so faithfully." 
                  "And would that make love in return?" 
                  "Yes, I am sure it would, with a generous heart like his." 
                  "And suppose you had a rival?" 
                  "What!" 
                  "Nay, don't look so indignant: I did not mean a rival like yourself: but suppose you had a rival in the wine, that cheered his heart more than you were able to cheer it with all your love?" 
                  "Hush! Agnes, hush! you will drive my senses away again." 
                  "Then you must listen to me, dear Magdalen. Was I not your mother's nurse? Have I not held you, an infant, in my arms, by night and by day, and rocked you many a weary hour upon my bosom; and can I behold you rushing into wretchedness, and not speak out, and tell you, as I do again, and again, that if you marry that young man, your doom is sealed, and your heart broken, as surely as I sit here?" 
                  "But, Agnes, we are both talking wildly; you see he does not come to see me; he has not even written, though I should have thought he would have done that, in common kindness." 
                  "It is a kindness that can well be spared." 
                  "Perhaps not so well as you think, Agnes. It is a hard thing for a woman to feel lonely and desolate, as I do now." 
                  "But why should you feel lonely, dear? I am sure I have no thoughts of leaving you." 
                  "Thank you, dear Agnes. I never for a moment suspected that you would; but"- 
                   
                  "I know what you are going to say. You are going to say that I busy myself too much with the affairs of the house, and so leave you, as you call it, alone." 
                  "No, Agnes, that was not exactly the kind of loneliness I meant. But no matter." 
                  And Magdalen suddenly changed the subject, by introducing some question relative to those all-important household matters, about which she would have felt no objection to her companion being still more earnestly occupied than she was; so little did her society afford to fill the blank which her mistress found in the existence to which she now appeared to be doomed. Fond as the orphan girl might otherwise have been of making the young sculptor the subject of her conversation with Agnes, there was one cause, to her, a very sufficient one, why she often found it prudent thus to break off abruptly. It was a latent fear lest Agnes should touch unfeelingly the character of Louis; above all, lest she should speak of that one besetting sin, of which Magdalen never would have believed him to be guilty, but for the evidence of her own senses. This evidence he had most unconsciously afforded her, and the impression it had made was too deep to be effaced. 
                  It was one night when her father was suffering more than usual from an accession of his painful malady. Louis had gone to meet a party of his friends, having promised to return at a certain hour. At this hour, the invalid, who had all that day been confined to one position, had pleased himself with the idea of being assisted by his young friend to make a change from one apartment to another; and both he and his daughter confidently relied upon this anticipated help. The hour arrived, however, but Louis came not. Another hour, and the invalid, restless and impatient, spoke harshly of his thoughtless and selfish pupil. 
                  "Not selfish!" Magdalen exclaimed, with more warmth than she was accustomed to betray; and her ear was turned with such aching anxiety to listen for his approaching step, that not a sound was heard in the house but by her imagination it was immediately construed into that which she most desired. 
                  At last he came. Magdalen flew to meet him. She looked in his face, but suddenly started back, and covered her eyes with both her hands, she stood leaning against the wall, and shuddering as if she had beheld something too monstrous to be looked at again. 
                  It was not, however, that Magdalen was capable of loathing the being she most loved. It was, that the conviction then flashed upon her, of all being too true which her father and Agnes had said against him. She had, until this moment, defended him with a clear and honest conviction of his innocence. She could never defend him again, now. That happiness was denied her. Or if she did it, it could only be with that in ward misgiving-that sinking of the heart-that sliding back from its once firm hold, which is worse a thousand times to bear than the bitterest reproaches heaped by others upon the object of our affection. 
                  "He is coming at last!" said Magdalen one day to Agnes, with a look of more than wonted satisfaction, and at the same time holding an open letter in her hand, while her flushed cheek, and sparkling eyes betrayed that more had been said in those charmed lines than belonged to the mere announcement of an intended visit. 
                  "Who is coming?" said Agnes, with that assumed absence of understanding with which we sometimes endeavor to resist an unpleasant conviction. 
                  "Louis himself is coming," replied Magdalen-"I always told you he would not forget me." 
                  "Forget, indeed!" muttered Agnes to herself-"does the fowler forget the bird he has caught in his snare, or the angler the fish that struggles at the end of his line? Forget, indeed! If I could have a fortune for asking for it, do you think I should forget to make it my own?" 
                   
                  "You are rambling on very fast," said Magdalen; "it seems rather strange that all these notions should have risen simply out of the proposed visit of an old friend. Would you not like to see Louis yourself?' 
                  "No, not here." 
                  "Is there nothing about him worthy of being loved? Come, Agnes, be candid, and speak without prejudice for once." 
                  "If the darkest of all eyes, and the brightest of all raven hair, and the wildest laugh, and the lightest heart, are reasons why a man should be loved, then is the youth well worthy of the affection you bestow upon him." 
                  "And will you not add to this catalogue of merits, the capability of feeling affection in return?" 
                  Agnes shook her head. 
                  "Tell me, good Agnes, what you really think on this subject-I am more serious than you suppose." 
                  "I think, then, that perhaps he is capable of loving according to the measure of man's love in general." 
                  "And don't you think that men can love as well as women?" 
                  Agnes laughed outright. 
                  "What can you mean, Agnes?" asked Magdalen. 
                  "I mean," she replied, "that when a man finds his house in disorder, and wants somebody to put it right, he calls this love; when he is alone, too, and things don't go pleasantly, and he wants somebody to complain to, and find fault with, and lay the blame upon, he calls this love. When no one cares for him, and he gets put down in society, and wants to bind himself for life to some being who will flatter him, and admire his very faults; this, too, he calls love. Man's love, indeed!" 
                  "What is love, then, Agnes, according to your notions of it?" 
                  "Love, as I take it, is that which is perpetually giving, without asking to receive. It is love that will make a woman cling to another person's child, and nurse and cherish it as if it was her own. It is love that keeps her watchful even while it sleeps, through the long night and heavy day, when not so much as a smile rewards her for her care. It is love that makes her follow this child in after life, when it grows up to wealth and beauty, and looks not back with fondness, nor turns with affection, to the companions of its infant sports. It is love that makes the welfare of this child so precious in her sight, that she would rather die than trust its happiness to care less hands." 
                  "You are right, Agnes," said Magdalen, while the tears glistened in her eyes; "you have indeed been to me the friend you have described; and yours, I know, is love." 
                  "Yet it cannot satisfy you." 
                  "No, not entirely; besides, if it did, in the common course of nature, you would die, and leave me." 
                  "There are worse things in life than to be left by the dead." 
                  "What can be worse?" 
                  "To be left by the living." 
                  "You don't think that Louis would be faithful, then?" 
                  "Not as I should be faithful." 
                  "Agnes, you do not know him." 
                  "There are different ways of knowing people: you know him as an equal-I as an inferior." 
                  Thus all things went on, exactly as she least wished they should. The young sculptor was permitted to come, and visit the daughter of his father's friend; and she, with all the gentleness and simplicity which belonged to her nature, received him with the joy of a sister, and perhaps with something more. In fact, her situation was so lonely, so utterly destitute of all companionship suited to her taste, that had her visitor been only an ordinary acquaintance, she could scarcely have met him without a thrill of delight; and because he had professed to love her better than ever brother loved a sister, Magdalen could not see why she ought to be less grateful, or less pleased. 
                  Louis Montreville made his appearance at the cottage with a light and buoyant spirit; entertaining as little doubt of his own success, as of the conquerable nature of the female heart in general. 
                  But rather than reveal what passed between the two friends thus met again after months of absence, let us watch them with the eye of old Agnes, and see how they walked out upon the sea-shore, and sat upon the rocks-the cold, damp rocks, at the imminent risk of the young lady's life, and returned not until the day closed, and sometimes not even until the autumn moon-so bright and so glorious,-had risen so as to light them on their way; and in spite of all the remonstrances of Agnes, who declared that no good ever came of walking out by moonlight, how they did the same thing the next day, and the next, until the time for the young man's departure came, when the maiden drooped like a flower under the first breath of a cold east wind. 
                  There was still, however, one precious evening-the last, to enjoy; yet Magdalen looked not only sorrowful, but distressed. It was evidently not merely the prospect of separation, and of the long age of dullness that would follow, which preyed upon her mind. There was a struggle, a conflict, which she vainly endeavored to conceal by seeking in the solitude of her own chamber for strength to make the decision which must be made that night. The intention of Magdalen had been to ask support, and the guidance she so much needed, in the language of prayer; but how to pray for the right direction, when inclination had already made plain the way, was a difficulty she had not thought of until she found herself alone. She was alone too in the chamber which was sacred to all her fondest recollections of her father; and although he had laid no injunction upon her as to the line of conduct she should pursue, his sentiments had been too often, and too clearly expressed, for her to doubt one moment of his decided disapprobation of her union with the young Sculptor. 
                  "On this one subject," she said, giving utterance to her thoughts, "my father always spoke with prejudice. Had he known him better-Oh, fool!" she exclaimed, with a sudden revulsion of feeling, "do I know him myself? Is there any power in earth or heaven, that can give me back my confidence?" And Magdalen, wringing her hands, gave way to a passionate burst of tears, such as her eyes had seldom known. 
                  There was nothing so distracting to the mind of Magdalen as suspicion. The most unwelcome truth would have harassed her less; and yet, to speak plainly to Louis on the subject, to which her thoughts were perpetually turning, seemed to her impossible, so repulsive, so degrading was every feature of that spectre which haunted her by day and visited her dreams by night. 
                  "Is there any difficulty in the way?" said Louis, when after all his arguments, and all his eloquence, Magdalen still hesitated. "Have you any doubts of me?" 
                  Magdalen turned upon him the keen searching look her father used to wear, but all she could say was "If-if-I were quite sure." 
                  "Sure of what!" asked Louis. "Speak plainly, dearest Magdalen. Trust me at least with your thoughts, if I am not worthy to be trusted with your happiness." 
                  "Do you not remember one night?" she replied. 
                  "What night? I cannot comprehend your meaning." 
                  "One awful night, when my father and I waited for you?" 
                  "Oh! now I understand you. You foolish girl, to make such a mountain of so small a matter. You mean, then, if I will never come home to you in that state again?" 
                   
                  "I do." 
                  "Then, Magdalen, here I promise you," and the graceful lover sank on one knee, and uttered such a vow-so earnest and so solemn, that Magdalen looked up with eyes too full of joy for tears, and inwardly returned thanks to the Father of mercies, whose smiles she now believed would bless the union to which she was about to pledge herself. 
                  Her doubts once cleared away, her fears dispelled, Magdalen felt no difficulty, and affected no reserve; but plighted her heart and hand with the same unhesitating trust which a child reposes in a parent; and when she met her lover on the following morning, it was with the deep impression of the solemn certainty that their future lot was one that for weal or wo they two were bound together; and that, let the rest of the world take what course it might, their path, whether rough or smooth, whether among roses or thorns, must be the same. 
                  "There is one thing I have not told you yet," said Magdalen, with quivering lips, and downcast eyes. 
                  "You must tell me now, then," said Louis, taking out his watch, "and without much delay, for I have no time to waste." 
                  "It is of no consequence now," said Magdalen, with the tone of one whose warm heart is suddenly chilled-whose deep feelings are suddenly frozen on the surface. 
                  The fact was, she was about to describe to her lover the peculiar nature of her own temperament, how she had never been used to anything but the tenderest affection, and how unkindness or neglect would soon bring her sufferings to an end, by terminating her life. 
                  And Louis Montreville went away, exulting in the success of his suit, yet almost wholly unconscious of the real value of the treasure he had made his own. Indeed, how should it have been otherwise? for what key of sympathy was there in his nature, to unlock the secrets of hers? Light, volatile, and gay, he flew back to the pleasures and pursuits he had left, thinking only of the time when he should have a beautiful bride to cheer his solitude. 
                  In his profession, however, Louis was still laborious and persevering, though much of the secret of his industry might be attributed to the success by which his ambition and his vanity were gratified, almost beyond his expectations. He was evidently a rising man, and as such was introduced into society, where his striking figure, and pleasing address, rendered him almost a universal favorite. The consequences may be easily inferred. Louis plunged headlong into that vortex of dissipation, into which thousands have fallen; while none knew but himself the extent to which in his mad career he was running. And still the flattering unction was perpetually laid to his soul, that this career was but temporary; that he could quit the course he had chosen whenever it was his pleasure or his interest to do so; and, above all, that his approaching marriage would put an end at once to his folly, and settle him for life as a regular and sober man. 
                  Without any material change, then, except what consisted in telling his associates that it was the last time he should join them in their revels, that he was about to grow wise, and get married, this important event of his life came on; and Magdalen was again placed within the shelter of her native home, and again she sat in the old window, and tuned her harp beneath the shadow of the vine-leaves, through which the checquered sunbeams had often fallen where her infant footsteps played. 
                  Louis Monterville, always sanguine and enthusiastic in whatever charmed his fancy, was, for a time at least, as much devoted to his lovely wife, as she, in the secret of her heart, could have desired. Every moment of his time, which could be spared from his profession, was spent in her society; and so far from feeling the loss of that which he had relinquished, he cheerfully, nay even proudly bore the jests of his associates, believing himself to be a richer and a happier man than any of them. If, however, on any occasion he consented to make one in the parties he had previously been the most forward to join, it was only for a brief space, for his return at an early hour was as certain as the never-failing smile of welcome which awaited him at home. 
                  "You see, Agnes," said Magdalen to her faithful attendant one day, "Louis is not the husband you anticipated he would be. Not once has he left me longer than absolute necessity required; not once has he returned as you prophesied he would." 
                  "It's dangerous talking to married people about either their husbands or their wives"-was all the reply which Magdalen's observation elicited; and the speaker went on with her work, with as much earnestness as if the subject was one of no sort of interest to her. 
                  "It can never be dangerous to speak of what is good," observed Magdalen. "But tell me, Agnes, were not my father and mother happy?" 
                  "As happy as woman's heart could wish, until your mother died." 
                  "Do you think I shall die then?" 
                  "No, it is not that I fear." 
                  "Yet, Agnes, I am far from strong." 
                  "I know it, child-I know it too well." 
                  "I feel sometimes as if I wanted all the kindness of Louis, and all your good nursing, to keep me as I am. A little falling off in either, and I think I should soon be laid beside my parents in their last and quiet home." 
                  "I know it all," said Agnes, as her eyes filled with tears. "I know it all, my poor child, too well." 
                  "It is wrong, however," resumed Magdalen, "to make troubles out of things never likely to happen. Believe me, dear Agnes, these dark days will never come, so far as Louis is concerned; and as for yourself, I am sure you will not leave me." 
                  "I may be called, however, before you, in the course of nature," said Agnes; "and then"- 
                  "Then God will be good to me," replied Magdalen, "and temper the wind to his shorn lamb." 
                  It was late one winter's night, when Magdalen and her faithful attendant held this conversation. Louis had dined with a party of his friends that day, and had not then returned. It was past his usual hour-past the hour of his promise; and Magdalen chid herself for having extorted such a promise, fearing he might feel too much condemned when he should return, to find that he had outstayed his time. It was a winter's night, and the wind blew fiercely, and the fond and trusting wife thought only of, how her husband would meet the bitter blast, and regretted a thousand times that she had not better prepared him for the midnight cold. Nor were these the only thoughts that troubled her, for the presence of Agnes became irksome, and she began to quail under the searching look with which her eye was ever and anon uplifted to the timepiece, and then turned upon her, as if to say, "This is just what I predicted. He is beginning now to let you know what is to be expected from such a husband." 
                  It was Magdalen's turn, however, to cast toward her companion significant and triumphant glances, when at last her husband returned, bringing with him such excellent excuses for having been detained, that her confidence was more than restored; and as Agnes silently withdrew, now that her mistress no longer needed her society to cheer her watching and waiting hours, Magdalen could not refrain from exclaiming, on purpose that her servant might hear, "I know you must have some good reasons for staying out so late." 
                  It is true, Louis looked more than usually flushed and excited that night; but this the fond wife really believed to have been occasioned by the speed with which he had hastened home; and she secretly loved him the better for having injured him, though only by the shadow of a doubt. She loved him the better, for in what other way could she atone for her injustice, and her want of faith? 
                  Louis Montreville was not yet so hardened by the course of conduct he had chosen for himself, as to be insensible to the superior charm with which the character of Magdalen was invested; he therefore determined, that let his own habits be what they might, the orphan girl whom he had solemnly pledged himself to love and cherish, should, so far as he was capable of effecting such an object, be kept unsullied by the world. For this purpose he received no company, and seldom went abroad with his wife; more especially, he refused to take her to any of those places of public amusement, at which in her girlish curiosity, she sometimes expressed a wish to be present; simply, as she said, that she might enjoy what he enjoyed, and be better able to understand and converse with him upon subjects which appeared to afford him such lively interest. 
                  "You are better at home, dearest," was the reply with which Louis always warded off the expression of such wishes. 
                  "Then why are you not also better at home?" was the very natural inquiry which usually followed. "Oh, Louis, I am learning the most delightful air. I am sure you will be enchanted with it. Or, shall I read to you this sweet poem, as I used to read to my poor father? He used to say that he gathered more ideas worth retaining from the books I read to him, than he ever could find in the society of other artists. Do you really find their company and conversation so necessary to the pursuit of your profession as you say, Louis?" 
                  "I have told you once how necessary it is, Magdalen; and I do not wish to be asked the question again. It seems to me as if you thought I could deceive you." 
                  "Oh, no, Louis, I am sure you would not do that; but I am so ignorant of the world that-" 
                  "That you had better not talk about it," replied Louis, rather hastily; and he left his young wife that evening, thinking, and not for the first time, that it was possible for a woman to be very sweet, and very beautiful, and yet very tiresome. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER III. 
                  MORE than a year had now elapsed since the marriage of Magdalen Steinberg. In addition to her other sources of domestic interest, she had become a mother; and if her cup of happiness was full before, what must be the measure of its overflowings now? But, hush! she is lulling a babe to sleep on her bosom, and, young as it is, already the reflection of a mother's smile is beginning to brighten on its face. What stillness is there! for it is nearly midnight, and not a sound is to be heard in that dimly-lighted chamber; and Agnes, the old domestic, sits moping and speechless by the fire, watching the dying embers drop from the bars, and breathing ever and anon a deep-drawn sigh, with a simultaneous uplifting of the fingers of the hand which rests upon her knee, while the sinking of the breath after that heavy sigh, and the falling of the fingers, keep time together, and seem to indicate that thus the last drops of consolation are ebbing out of her portion of the mingled cup of human life. 
                  How little do persons in the situation of Agnes know of that delicate and easy tact by which sorrow may sometimes be beguiled of some portion of its weight. Thus, while the poor will plunge at once into their own or other people's troubles, making them as much the subject of conversation as they are of thought; we find in that sphere of life, where the refinements of feeling are perhaps a little too much cultivated, that anything is talked about rather than the calamity over which the mind still lingers, despite the constant effort of those who would lead it off into any channel except that by which it is absorbed. 
                  Agnes knew little of the art of ministering to a mind diseased. Skilful as she was in caring for the body, she had remained through life unacquainted with the fact, that there are wounds which no hand should probe, causes of anxiety to which no words should allude, and sufferings which no sympathy should attempt to reach. Thus, when her master, as was his custom now, spent many of his evenings, and the early part of the night, from home, instead of beguiling her mistress of her weary watchings by tales of the olden-time-or, above all other themes to the heart of a young mother, by the comparison or contrast of other children with her own-she sat as now the picture of despondency, looking such unutterable things that Magdalen would sometimes rouse herself so far as to rally her old attendant upon the cheerless nature of her companionship during their evening hours. 
                  And was Magdalen herself still happy? So far as the objects of her affection were multiplied she was indeed; but in proportion as the warmth of a new existence had been kindled in her bosom, she looked like one whom that warmth was consuming by its inward and secret power. Her eyes, which had always been beautiful, were now doubly so; for ever, as she gazed upon her child, their deepened expression beamed forth with such a softened radiance, as nothing but the fervor of a mother's affection could impart; and then her cheek, too, was more flushed at times, as with a sort of hectic; and over the rose-tints glowing there, fell the dark shadow of her long eye-lashes, and the darker folds of her richly-flowing hair. 
                  But was she happy? Ask any single individual among the sons and daughters of earth, whose all has been cast at the feet of one idol, and that of clay. 
                  No, there were many causes now why Magdalen should spend feverish and sleepless nights, beside those which originated in the natural delicacy of her constitution. The thing which she had so greatly feared, had come upon her. Her husband had neglected, she thought, he had grown weary of her altogether. At all events he had given himself up to other associates, and the sin which had always most easily beset him; and instead of making the most of his day of prosperity, and pushing on the success which at one time dawned upon his efforts, instead of devoting himself body and mind to a profession, which, highly gifted as he was, required all he could give to it, of both, he endeavored to satisfy his friends and patrons with promises which were never fulfilled; and while he eagerly undertook everything proposed to him, he completed nothing. 
                  In this state of things, it is astonishing how rapidly the pecuniary resources of a family find the means of ebbing away. Not the strictest economy on the part of the female portion of the household can be of any important avail, to stem the current which then sets in, to flow on with accelerated force toward the sea of ruin. Of this economy, however, poor Magdalen knew nothing; and out of her total ignorance of domestic affairs, and the habits of unoccupied listlessness which had grown upon her as a motherless girl, arose the first secret complaint in the heart of her husband, and the first justification of himself for leaving a house where a want of order and good management were becoming daily more evident. 
                  "I am such as you found me," poor Magdalen would often plead in her own defence. "I was never taught these things, and my father was always satisfied." 
                  But all would not do. Her husband appeared to expect that she should be at the same time the calm still beauty of the studio, whom he had seen sitting contented at her father's feet; and the active, bustling housewife, who could heal, by the magic of her skill and her economy, any breaches he might choose to make in the order of their household. Of failing health, and of the extra occupation which a young child would occasion, he made no account. It was sufficient for him that Magdalen was not dressed with elegance-that she was not forthcoming when he called-that the child could not always be laid aside for the harp-sufficient to furnish an excuse for doing what was most agreeable to him-for leaving her society, and plunging into the convivial excesses of another evening. 
                  In this manner their affairs went on. Magdalen had no one to complain to, and would not have uttered a syllable of complaint if she had. And amid all the trouble, and confusion, and heart-sickness, and perplexity, that little child grew strong, and flourished, and laughed, and sported, and twined its arms around the neck of its sad mother, who sometimes looked at it with an expression of passionate fondness, and then turned away her head as if the sight of its innocent gambols was more than she could bear. 
                  But if, as is sometimes the case, Louis Montreville felt annoyed at the manner in which his wife devoted her time and her attention to her infant charge, that infant itself was an object of irresistible attraction, which his heart was unable to withstand; and often, when not quite himself, he lavished endearments both upon the mother and the child, so extravagant in their expression, that Magdalen would sometimes shrink away repelled, if not disgusted; and then he would say harsh things about her coldness, and accuse her of driving him away from home. 
                  All the reply which Magdalen was ever known to make to such accusations was by a look-a pitiful, appealing look-such as he had almost lost the power of understanding; for not only were his nightly indulgences becoming more frequent, but such was the state of his affairs, that in the hope of getting rid of anxious and perplexing thoughts, he drowned his faculties in partial oblivion during the greater part of every day. 
                  It was late one night on his return home, that Louis was met at the door by old Agnes, who, with significant nod and gesture, endeavored to make him understand, what he was wholly incapable of comprehending. In vain she lifted up her hand in sign of caution, in vain she implored him to tread lightly on the stairs. It was all one to him just then, whether his wife was dead, or his child stolen, or whether both these calamities had occurred. With dizzy gaze, and senseless nod, he answered all her entreaties; and staggering up to his own apartment, was at last made to understand that he must find another for that night; not, however, until an altercation had taken place sufficiently loud to wake the most distant sleeper in the house. 
                  The following morning, at an early hour, Agnes stood at the bed-side of her master, holding a night-lamp in her hand. She had evidently been watching all night, and while he endeavored to shake off the heavy sleep and burning headache which still stupified his senses, she succeeded at last in making him understand that her mistress had been taken alarmingly ill on the previous evening; but that she had not dared to send for him, knowing but too well the state in which he would return, and fearing the effect it might have upon her. "Her case," she said, "was the rupture of a blood-vessel, occasioned by a violent fit of weeping." 
                  "Weeping? what for?" asked Louis. 
                  "For you," replied Agnes, with as much meaning in her looks, as the words themselves conveyed. 
                  "For me?" exclaimed Louis, suddenly starting from his pillow. "Then I have killed her!" and he would at that instant have rushed into the apartment of his wife, had not Agnes, who was a powerful woman for her age, forcibly grasped his arm, and told him that the precious life of her mistress was now depending solely upon the care with which she might be preserved from every kind of excitement, both of body and mind. 
                  Notwithstanding this caution, many hours had not elapsed, before Louis was alone with his wife in her own apartment, where, after securing the door against all intruders, he knelt down beside the bed on which she lay, as pale, and almost as motionless, as if death had already sealed her doom; yet there he was, with her thin, white hand clasped in his, his eloquent lips pouring forth the language of his first love, with many a solemn vow, and awful denunciation of judgment upon himself if that vow should be broken, that he would never offend again; or wring the heart whose peace he valued more than his own, by a repetition of the excesses he had committed. 
                  And Magdalen was happy again; for does not all human happiness exist by comparison? and contrasted with the long, dark night of loneliness and joyless solitude through which she had lately passed, was it not happiness to hear again the voice of affection-the music of her childhood-sounding in her ear, though it might be on the brink of the grave? And was it not happiness, too, to know he whose good in every sense was more precious to her than her own, was about to return from his wanderings, as she fondly hoped, to redeem the past. 
                  Great as the excitement necessarily was, (for to some minds the shock of unexpected happiness is more than that of grief,) Magdalen contrary to the predictions of Agnes, continued to recover. Nor was it long before she resumed her place again in the family, with-now, a strange spectacle to behold-her husband ever at her side. 
                  So entire was the revulsion of feeling in the mind of Louis when convinced of the reality of that calamity which seemed to hang as it were by a single hair above his head, that for many days he lived almost as abstemiously as the patient herself, determined that nothing of an intoxicating nature should pass his lips, until symptoms of recovery had appeared, to cheer his drooping spirit. Now, however, Magdalen was so far restored as to be recommended by her medical attendant to take a small quantity of wine every day; and Louis, who kindly poured it out for her, in the gladness of his feelings, very naturally filled a glass for himself. One glass, however, was nothing to a man of his habits, and without any thought of harm, he took another, feeling, as people say they do on such occasions, both better and happier for the welcome draught. 
                  The gradual falling back of her husband into his former habits was watched by poor Magdalen with the most intense anxiety; but, with a delicacy ill-suited to the case, she never ventured either to warn him of his danger, or to entreat him for her sake to refrain. There are strange anomalies in human nature, and it is not the least, that we have sometimes the greatest difficulty in speaking on subjects which are the most constant companions of our thoughts. Perhaps the feeling which operated upon the mind of Magdalen, was a conviction of the pain it would occasion her to have given cause for reproof of such a nature; and therefore, judging of her husband by the same rule, she shrunk from inflicting upon him, what she could so ill have borne herself. At all events, she spoke not; and the tears she wept in secret, left no other trace upon her cheeks, than an increase of paleness at one part of the day, and an increase of hectic at another. 
                  "Sir," said Agnes one day to her master, laying her hand upon his arm to detain him, as he was about to leave the house, "If I might speak to you for a minute." 
                  "Well, Agnes, what is the matter?" said Louis stepping back rather reluctantly. 
                  "Matter enough sir," murmured Agnes; "but that's not to the point. I want to know, sir, what is to be done about getting this poor dear soul removed to a warmer place for the winter?" 
                   
                  "Of whom are you speaking, Agnes; what do you mean?" 
                  "I am speaking of your wife, sir; and I mean that she will not live through the coming winter here." 
                  "Nonsense! woman, how foolishly you talk. Who told you that Magdalen would not live through the winter. 
                  "The doctor told me so." 
                  "What doctor?" 
                  "The doctor I called in to look at the child; for as to having a doctor for herself, poor dear, she would not hear of that. So I spoke to him before he went in, and told him to notice the mother as well as the child." 
                  "And what did he say?" 
                  "He said she was dying." 
                  "Impossible." 
                  "Why, everybody sees it but you. The very passers-by, when we walk out with the child, look back, and pity her; and I heard one of them say the other day, 'that poor lady is not long for this world.'" 
                  "You astonish me, Agnes. It seems to me that Magdalen is so much better." 
                  "She is just better, as the sky is brighter when the sun goes down; but as surely as you see that red light in the west, so surely the day is sinking to its close. And so it will be with her. Yet the doctor says a warmer air might possibly prolong her life; and he charged me, as I valued that life, to get her off out of the country without delay." 
                  "What climate did he recommend?" 
                  "I think he called it Madeira." 
                  "You talk of impossibilities, Agnes. I have not the means." 
                  "Means? What should hinder? What should hinder but you should work for her? She is richly worth it, sir." 
                  "I know her worth as well as you can, Agnes; but I tell you again, it is impossible!" 
                  "If I mistake not," continued the unrelenting woman, "you were compelled by law to allow her something, even if she had not been your wife. But sir, there is a higher law than this. There is the law of love. Oh that I was as young as you, and clever as they say you are; I would work night and day, till my hands were worn to skeletons; I would leave no friend unsought, and no means untried but I would gain my point; and then I would place her where the sun was always shining, and the air was always mild and pure; and if at last she must die, it should be among flowers; and she should breathe her last upon a bosom whose happiness it would ever be to think that nothing had been denied her that was necessary for her comfort or her peace," 
                  "Do you think she would go to Madeira, if we had the means?" 
                  "I think she would do her best to live, for the sake of the child." 
                  "Ah! Agnes, if I could do as you say?" 
                  "Could!" exclaimed Agnes, "I would do it; nothing on earth should hinder me. Oh, sir! if you did but know the power of love? As I said before, if I had but your head and your hands, I would show you what love could do." 
                  While Agnes uttered these words Louis sunk into a chair, and at the same time allowed his thoughts to be absorbed by a profound reverie, not to be interrupted by the many-after remarks which Agnes thought herself entitled to make. At last, starting from the attitude in which he remained for a long time, with his eyes fixed upon the ceiling of the room, he hurried into the studio, where the crumbling fragments of those vast designs, which had occupied his more ambitious moments, lay scattered in frightful and ruinous disorder all around the room. But if the neglected works of his hand presented so hopeless and melancholy a picture, what was to be expected from that smaller portion of his establishment devoted to the records of what his mind had but faintly conceived? although for the full and entire completion of many of these shadowy conceptions, his promise had already gone forth, in consequence of which, expectations were awaiting the arrival of the finished performance in many distant parts of the country, as well as in the immediate neighborhood of his home. 
                  Every genius, and especially every idle and procrastinating genius, knows with how little relish we return to the execution of neglected or cast-off designs; especially when the pressure of degrading or adverse circumstances renders their execution a work of necessity, rather than of choice. Opening a desk, which indeed was scarcely capable of being shut, on account of the number of lose and crumbled papers with which it was more than filled, the young sculptor began to take one out after another; but at the same time to cast them aside with a look and a movement of absolute disgust. Not one of these papers, whether it presented the faint outline of a design, or merely the written memorial of a promise, appeared to afford him the slightest pleasure; and it is more than probable that his contemplated effort would have ended in a momentary vision, had not the appearance of a stranger, just then announced, put an end to these disagreeable subjects of reflection, by introducing one much more congenial to his taste, simply from the fact of its being new. 
                  Lord M-who appeared at this auspicious moment, was a young man of immense property, who had recently lost his wife, the mother of an infant child, who in the course of a few weeks followed its parent to the tomb. He had heard much of the fame of the young sculptor, and he had now sought him out, for the express purpose of engaging him to design and execute a monument to the memory of his departed wife. 
                  Nothing could have been more in accordance with the wishes of Louis at this moment, and eagerly catching the idea, the intelligence of his whole mind was instantly pictured in his countenance, with so much light and life that the young nobleman, delighted with having found an artist who could really comprehend his meaning, was led into a more lengthened and feeling description of the character and appearance of his lost wife, than he could have believed himself capable of being betrayed into, in the presence of a stranger; and it so happened that the beauty upon which he expatiated, appeared to Louis to be of a kind exactly resembling that of Magdalen. 
                  Full of this new idea, and really in earnest in what he was about to undertake, Louis was unusually silent and absorbed in the presence of his wife that day; until accidentally catching a glimpse of her figure as she sat with her child asleep in her arms, he started from his seat exclaiming in frenzy of delight, "I have it now, Magdalen. Sit there, sit still, and I will accomplish a work that will startle the world." 
                  Magdalen looked up, and smiled. She too was delighted with anything that might win back her husband's affection for an art, which for her father's sake she had early learned to venerate and love. But when Louis farther opened to her his plans for realising a sum of money sufficient for removing her to a warmer climate, she looked up no longer, but drooping her head over her sleeping child, said with a deep sigh, "Ah, Louis, it is too late!" 
                  "I will not believe it!" exclaimed Louis. "Agnes is right, when she says nothing is too great for the power of love to accomplish; and I will prove to you at last, Magdalen, that I have loved you, though you are sometimes inclined to doubt it. But tell me, have you strength, have you patience to be my model?" 
                  "I have patience," replied Magdalen; "but I doubt my strength. However, I will try. You can but work as long as it lasts." 
                  Accordingly all arrangements were made, and Louis, with that feverish excitement which characterized all the movements into which he threw his hopes of success, began what was indeed a beautiful design, though much indebted to the perfect symmetry, and the classic elegance, of the figure of his patient wife, who devoted herself to the silent endurance with as much earnestness and assiduity, as that with which he pursued the more active portion of the task which fell to his share. 
                  Not many weeks, however, had elapsed, before Louis grew tired, declaring that he must have a day of relaxation to enable him to proceed with success, and he agreed to join a party of young artists on an excursion into the country. From this excursion he returned with less relish for work than before. His spirits appeared depressed, his brow was dark and heavy, and his thoughts appeared to be wandering to other subjects. Stimulus he declared was the only thing he wanted, and that being always at hand, he had recourse to it, drinking more and more each day, until at last he became wholly incapacitated, and laid aside his design, as he had often done before, to be remembered only as the subject of vain-glorious boasting, when enjoying the evening's carousal among companions of the same class with himself. 
                  How long this state of affairs might have continued, it is impossible to say, had not that crisis arrived, which, to all who neglect their only means of pecuniary subsistence, is sooner or later inevitable. It became no longer a secret that Louis Montreville was in difficulties. His friends had predicted it long, and his enemies only wondered how he had continued to live from day to day. One resource alone remained to him. It was to make an entire surrender of the property which had belonged to the father of Magdalen, not only of the house and premises, but of the works of art, which the elder sculptor had been years in collecting. In order to the farther pursuit of his art, Louis made arrangements for still occupying the premises as a tenant; and now he again determined, and, kneeling at her feet again, he solemnly pledged himself to his wife, that henceforth he would renounce his besetting sin, and labor for her with his head and hands, as no man had ever labored for his wife before. 
                  It is remarkable, however, that persons of fickle and sanguine temperament, though having failed a thousand times, will still continue to believe themselves; and what is rather hard upon their friends, they generally feel as much hurt by any want of faith in their promises, as if such promises had never been broken. In the present instance, Louis Montreville scrupled not to accuse his wife of coldness, and injustice; and, worse than all, of being indifferent to that great reformation of character which he protested again and again should be effected; while she in her turn, more justly hurt by his accusations, quietly replied, "I only wish I might live to see it." 
                  "Live!" exclaimed Louis, "you must live, Magdalen. Indeed, I cannot see that you are so ill as you suppose. Come, dearest," said he, "you shall be my own Magdalen once more; but you must sit for me again, as you used to do, or I shall never be able to finish the work that is to be the means of transporting you to Madeira." 
                  With the utmost composure Magdalen took her seat again with the child in her arms, and, although the weather was cold and wintry, she submitted without hesitation or murmur to be dressed in a loose drapery, the folds of which Louis was soon busily employed in copying. Indeed, so intent and so earnest was he in this great undertaking, which was at once to redeem his own character, and save the life of his wife, that he could not perceive the shivering chill which was gradually creeping over her whole frame. At last the trembling of the mother awoke the child; but even then Louis requested that it might be removed, and that Magdalen would keep the folds of her dress exactly as they were, at least for one hour longer. 
                  Without a word of remonstrance, Magdalen endeavored to compose herself again, though her teeth now chattered as if an ague fit was upon her. 
                  "What can be the matter with you?" exclaimed Louis, stirring up the embers of a low fire, at the other end of the apartment. "I do not feel the room at all cold." 
                  "Perhaps," said Magdalen, "you are better clothed than I am; besides which, you know I fancied I was not very well before I began. 
                  "You fancy many things now, Magdalen. I wish you would try to think yourself in better health, and then I feel sure you will be so. Look at the many inducements you have for living; and do try, for my sake, and for the sake of the child, to rouse yourself." 
                  If ever in her whole life the goaded spirit of Magdalen had risen to the height of indignation, it was now, when with flashing eyes she looked up into her husband's face; while, as if every drop of blood which that chilling occupation had locked within her heart, came burning back, and diffused itself into momentary crimson all over her brow and cheek. It was but a transient ebullition of feeling, however, and as the tide ebbed back again, to leave her faltering lips more pale, she longed to throw her arms around her husband's neck, and, weeping on his bosom like a child, to ask, where she might more appropriately have offered forgiveness. 
                  But Louis, whose mind was filled, almost exclusively, with one idea, had resumed his work. The subject of the conversation with him had passed away; and Magdalen never had been one to intrude upon the thoughts or occupations of others with any mention of herself. 
                  "Go on, Louis," she said, as her husband seated himself; I feel a little warmer now, and you had better work while you can." 
                  "That was just my idea," said Louis, coolly, "or I would not have troubled you." 
                  And while he plied his busy fingers, with his eye intent upon his work, now advancing, and now retreating, in order to take a more general view of the whole, studying the development of each particular muscle, calculating the distance of every relative part, observing how greater fulness must be brought out here, how this must be elevated, and that depressed; and referring, with the precision of an anatomist, to that mute figure seated in an attitude of repose, while a restless fever burned within her; he saw not, or understood not, that a wild expression, foreign to her nature, was flashing from her eyes, while an unwonted propensity to break the silence of his studies occasionally forced from her lips the utterance of some incoherent expression; when, smiling at her own folly, she folded her arms, and promised to be still, quite still again. 
                  "You are not angry with me, Louis, dear, are you?" said she with that look of guileless and fearless simplicity which had characterized her happier hours. 
                  "No," replied Louis, "I am not angry yet, but I certainly shall be, if you do not take more pains to keep the folds on the left side unruffled." 
                  "Ah! Louis, it is there that the mischief lies. It is all the beating of my heart. If you could still the tumult there, I should indeed be a different creature." 
                  "How can I still it, Magdalen? I cannot love you better than I do." 
                  "Thank you, dear Louis. Thank you a thousand, thousand times for loving such a poor dull worthless creature as I am. And if I should never live to speak to you on this subject again, let me here thank you from my inmost soul, for the life of toil and of self-denial you are leading for my sake. But that I know it to be a wholesome and necessary restraint, I could not bear to see you laboring as you do." 
                  "How do you mean by wholesome, Magdalen? you would not wish me to live always in this abstemious way, would you? 
                  "Not simply for my sake, certainly; but for your own, and for the sake of the poor child who will soon be left to you alone. Oh! now! if you would promise me one thing, Louis, I would sit so still all day, and all night too, until my life had silently ebbed away, and I had become like the cold and senseless form you are copying." 
                  "What is that, dear Magdalen?" 
                  "That by the time our boy shall have begun to think and act for himself, you will adopt this system of abstinence, not only for the sake of his temporal, but his eternal happiness." 
                  "Now, Magdalen, it is my turn to think you unreasonable. It is always bad policy to ask too much. I would not promise this to the best friend I had in the world. 
                  "Those words sound cold, Louis. If you have a better friend, I am sure you have none truer than myself." 
                  "I beg your pardon. I forgot to whom I was speaking. But, to tell the truth, I was thinking of this fall in the drapery, whether it ought to be so." And Louis retreated, and looked again; and then again retreated, to see the effect of what he had just done. 
                  When very intent upon anything which interested him, it was extremely difficult for Louis Montreville to give his attention to any other subject, especially one which must necessarily put a stop to occupations which he regarded for the moment as all-important. Thus, while the most indifferent observer would have seen the fatal risk to which he was subjecting his wife, the paramount idea in his mind being the essential service he was about to render her by the steady and successful pursuit of his art, he could not give his mind to entertain a thought of the possibility there was, that his success might be rendered unavailable by the very means he was adopting to ensure it. 
                  There is a point, however, beyond which, even if human patience could endure, human strength must fail; and at this point poor Magdalen had arrived, when she meekly implored her husband to set her at liberty for that day at least, promising that she would do better if possible on the morrow. 
                  When that morrow came, Magdalen was tossing on a restless couch, the victim of a burning fever; and against such a crisis it was, that Agnes had been especially warned. "The least shock, the least cold, or the least fever," said the doctor, "will just produce that acceleration of disease, which her constitution has not power to withstand, and consumption will follow." 
                  These words were but too true; and, though partially recovered after the first attack, Magdalen never, during the whole winter, resumed her accustomed place in the family; nor, though often solicited by her husband, could she hold the child so long in her arms as to sit for his model again. 
                  Louis could not understand this. He could not see why, when her eyes were so bright, her cheeks so flushed, and her whole appearance so animated and brilliant, she could not assist him sometimes in the great work he had undertaken purely for her sake. Had he noticed the chill pale look she wore in the early part of the day, he might perhaps have been more easily convinced of the actual progress of her disease; but the fact was, he had become increasingly absorbed in his one great object, increasingly pleased with his own industry and perseverance, and, above all, increasingly confident of success. 
                  Never before had the young sculptor worked with such brilliant expectations as now. Never before had he really taken the extent of his own genius. Notwithstanding all his fickleness and frivolity on other subjects, he had beneath this superficial surface of character a deep passion for his art, and this passion was now growing into actual form, and showing itself forth in the grace and symmetry of a design, as beautiful as it was true to nature and to life. 
                  In this manner the long winter passed over, and the Sculptor relaxed not from his work. The spring came, and Magdalen again revived, for her mind was more at rest, and though she still felt no confidence in her husband's stability, so many days and weeks glided on, without any deviation on his part, that she must have been ungrateful and insensible indeed, had she not rejoiced in the welcome change. She began, too, to think sometimes that perhaps she might live-perhaps she might be happy again; and oh, how sweet then was the thought of renovated nature, of the song of the birds, and the springing of fresh flowers; but especially of the time when Louis had promised that he would go with her to a distant land, where a soft and genial climate would restore her wasted strength. 
                  Any one but herself, and he who ought to have watched her more carefully, might have known that these hopes were delusive, and she knew it too; yet there were times when her wishes were too strong for her judgment, and when fever supplied an energy which she mistook for amended health. It was the part of Agnes to check this exuberance of hope, simply by her evident want of participation in its pleasing pictures. Beyond this, she dared not venture, lest the reaction of a mind so sensitive as Magdalen's, should produce some fearful crisis such as that which had been the occasion of her father's sudden death. 
                  And thus-the summer months, too, passed away, and Louis announced his work as being so nearly completed, that as the time was now approaching when that change must be made, if made at all, upon which he believed the life of Magdalen to be depending, he determined to appeal at once to the kind feelings of Lord M-, to state to him the situation of his family, the prospects he entertained for the restoration of his wife, and, trusting to his well-known liberality, to ask an advance of the sum of money stipulated in their agreement, or at least as much as might enable him to place his wife beyond the chilling influence of the autumnal atmosphere of her native land. 
                  For this purpose he undertook a journey to the north of England, where the residence-of Lord M- was situated; and a melancholy mockery it was, to see him take leave of Magdalen, promising to come back with glad tidings that would cheer her heart, and urging her in the meantime to direct Agnes in the different preparations necessary for her journey. 
                  Yet in all this Louis was perfectly sincere. The change in Magdalen's state of health having been so gradual as scarcely to be perceived by any but a close observer. Besides which, he was one of those, and they are not few in number, who know so little about illness in general, as to suppose that where the spirits are cheerful, the cheek rosy, and the eye bright, there cannot be much amiss with the bodily functions. 
                  "And do you really think, Agnes," said Magdalen to her faithful attendant, "that I shall not live to benefit by this change of air, about which we talk so much?" 
                  "You must not ask me that question," replied Agnes, "unless you wish to hear what no one else will tell you." 
                  "What is that, Agnes? I always wish to hear the truth." 
                  "But how am I to make you believe that it is the truth?" 
                  "Why, I confess it seems very strange that I should not know best myself in what state I really am. You must acknowledge I have been better during the last fortnight. And, O, Agnes! if I should recover-if I should ever live to reward poor Louis for his patience and self-denial!" 
                  "Don't think of that, dearest. Patience and self-denial have their own reward." 
                  "But why should I not think of it? Why should I not picture to myself that bright, blue sky, that sunshine that glows in my imagination, those flowers that never fade, and those soft, sweet airs that ever I could breathe, and that would fan this burning brow, and bring back to my eyelids the gentle sleep of a young child? Why, Agnes, should I not think of these things, when the gloom of this great city is around me, and I pant for breath, and lie awake all night, listening to the heavy tumult of the vast multitudes, not one of whom would care if they were trampling on my grave? It is something to think of, even if I should die in that far-off land. But, O, Agnes, if I should live!" 
                  "You will live, dear child, but it will not be there, nor here. If you must think of cloudless skies, and gentle airs, and flowers that never fade, let it be of the skies, and the airs, and the flowers of heaven, for there only will you ever enjoy them." 
                  "But I am not fit for heaven, Agnes; and I would fain live a little longer to think of that, too, for I fear-I greatly fear, I have been seeking my heaven upon earth." 
                  "Let death come when it will, you cannot say that you have been called away unwarned. This sick bed, this darkened chamber, these restless nights, your poor, thin fingers, your burning cheeks, and throbbing pulse, are all warnings that it is time-high time to prepare." 
                  "You terrify me, Agnes. I dare not think of that cold grave in which I saw my mother laid. I would cling to you, dear Agnes, to Louis and my child; I would open my heart afresh to all your tenderness; I would draw you closer to my bosom, by my gratitude and love. And then I am so young: why, Agnes, I am not three-and-twenty yet. There is much to be done, and still more to be enjoyed, before I shall reach the natural limit of human existence." 
                  "God does not calculate as we do, the years that we have lived, or might live. He has his own wise purposes in what he does, and it is for us to submit." 
                  In this manner Agnes reasoned, according to her knowledge, with one whose warm and vivid feelings would have been more easily directed through the medium of her imagination, and might possibly have been thus led to contemplate those eternal and momentous truths whose full and clear development was becoming hourly more important to her peace and safety; while, with such a companion, presenting to her the cold and naked fact of her approaching death, she shrunk back appalled from the prospect which had seldom been presented to her mind in any but repulsive colors. 
                  While Agnes and her mistress pursued this conversation, Louis was speeding on his journey, full of hope and exultation, pleased with the new scenes which presented themselves, and still more pleased with the reception which welcomed him as an honored guest at the residence of Lord M-, in the north of England. Here it would have been difficult for Louis, had he waited many days, to lay before his patron the object of his journey, so entirely was he treated as a gentleman, and an equal; but, happily for that object, his impetuous nature prompted him to speak fully and freely on the subject in the first private interview to which he was invited. 
                  His request to the good-natured nobleman was readily complied with, and Louis might have hastened home with the glad tidings before Magdalen had had time to feel his absence long; but of all the temptations which could have been placed in his way, that of filling a place in distinguished society, of sharing on familiar and friendly terms the luxuries of a splendid mansion, and of mixing on such terms with men of talent, and lovers of the fine arts, was that which Louis was least able to resist. Besides which his great object being served, his merit, as he thought, complete, he had no longer need of self-denial, and so far as a regard for his character and dignity would permit, he plunged into every indulgence, not excepting that which had been the bane of his life. 
                  Still, however, Louis was not so reckless as to commit himself to any great excess; nor, in a situation so entirely suited to his taste, did he feel the actual need of so much excitement, to enliven and invigorate his spirits, as when harassed with the low cares and pressing avocations of his home. Thus he only launched, as it were, once more upon a sea of danger, steering warily at first, and keeping steadily in view the boundary-line, beyond which it would have been folly and disgrace to go. 
                  But the time came at last, when, from the arrival of different members of Lord M-'s family, and other circumstances which Louis was not slow to perceive, it became inexpedient for his patron to urge his longer stay. He, therefore, waited not to bring upon himself the mortification of having remained too long, but with a grace and dignity, which he well knew how to assume, took leave of Lord M-, without any one of his household suspecting the real nature of those pressing circumstances which had brought so lively and delightful a companion within their circle. 
                  If the temptation of his patron's hospitable board had been difficult for Louis to resist, how much more so was that of being suddenly and entirely deprived of all the enjoyments in which he was naturally prone to revel, in being driven out from that brilliant scene, to become an ordinary wayfaring man upon a public road, the companion of those who traveled for their trade, or whose trade enabled them to travel-and with his purse, for him so full, the weather as it happened then both dull and rainy, and that sad home, and sickly wife, and humble means of living, at the end of his dull journey! 
                  To all these circumstances Louis had been made most feelingly alive, by the increased pelting of the rain, just as the vehicle, in which he occupied an outside place, stopped at one of those large inns, situated on the great road from London to the north. The season for grouse-shooting had commenced, and this inn being one of the head-quarters for sportsmen at that time of the year, Louis was amusing himself by scanning the different figures of those idlers of autumn, in all their varieties of costume, when the countenance of an old friend presented itself to view, and in another instant he was warming himself at a cheerful fire, while his friend was urging him to stay for one day at least, to share his sport among the moors. 
                  Louis thought of his wife, of her prolonged expectations, and, as he feared, her increased feebleness, both of which had been described to him in a letter from Agnes. And the fact of the servant having to write this letter, owing to the inability of her mistress, had startled him, for a moment, from his accustomed blindness to her actual state. 
                  "Still it cannot possibly be of any consequence," said he, while reasoning to himself, "whether I reach home to-morrow, or the next day. I am sure I have worked hard enough to merit this relaxation; and besides, I take such good tidings with me, that Magdalen must be better, whether she thinks herself so or not." 
                  With these thoughts crowding upon his mind, he looked out from the dim window of that cheerful room. The lamps of the heavy coach were just lighted, the guard had sounded his horn for the passengers, who slowly resumed their miserable places on the roof, under the slender canopy of a few dripping umbrellas, while tarpauling and mackintosh were in requisition to the utmost limit of their stretch, to cover the already soaked habiliments of those, who thus prepared themselves for another night and day of patient endurance. 
                  It was altogether an unattractive spectacle. "I will not go," said Louis, and he hastened out to tell the coachman to drive on without him. 
                  And now-but it may easily be supposed, how that day, and another, and another passed, where there was no restraint, no character to lose; with the means of unbounded gratification perpetually at hand. Here, too, no letter from his melancholy home could reach him, and Louis said each morning when awaking from his feverish sleep, "I dare say Magdalen is better. I will not return to-day." At last, however, whether sated by excess, or roused into effort by the departure of his friend, he did prepare himself for undertaking the remainder of his journey home; but it was this time with broken health and sinking spirits, accompanied with a nervous apprehension, not unusual under such circumstances, that some calamity was impending over him, or some fearful tidings awaiting his return. 
                  Those who had seen the young sculptor set off on that journey, would scarcely have recognized in him the same individual who lifted with trembling fingers the knocker of his own door. 
                  "Is all well?" said Louis, when the door was opened to him by a little girl, employed only when extra-assistance was required in the family. 
                  "Much the same, I believe, sir;" was the quiet reply; and Louis felt that moment as if a mountain had been removed from his heart. 
                  "Mamma is asleep," said the little child, who met his father in the passage, and who had been studiously taught by Agnes, to say 'hush!' and to lift his rosy finger as a signal that no noise was to be made. "Mamma sleeps so long," it continued; and Louis felt another fearful misgiving-another heart-quake, as he questioned what that sleep could mean. 
                  "Your mistress," said he to the girl when he had called her back, "is-is"-he could proceed no further. 
                  "Is much the same, sir," was again answered; and Louis was again relieved from a suspicion which brought with it too much of agony to be long endured. 
                  "Mamma wants you," said the child, as it watched him adjusting his hair and arranging his dress before a glass, where the glimpse he caught of his altered appearance convinced him that the scrutinizing eye of affection would not be long before it detected the nature and the cause of his prolonged absence from home. 
                  "Mamma shall see me now," said he at last, when all had been done which his ingenuity could suggest, to restore the proper look and character of the outward man; while, snatching the child in his arms he added, "I have good news to tell mamma; you shall come with me, and see how sweetly she will smile." 
                  It was a sort of relief to the troubled mind of Louis, once more to clasp his child to his bosom; but as its cherub cheek was pressed to his, a sudden thrill of compunctious feeling sent unbidden tears into his eyes, to think what he might have been to that sweet child, and its sweeter mother. 
                  "But I have glad tidings to tell her," he said again; though not until this fact had been repeated many times, could he force himself into the presence of that mother, knowing, as he did, the just cause she had to meet him with reproach instead of welcome. 
                  "Hush, hush!" said a faint voice as he opened the door of the chamber; and the child, accustomed to the caution, again lifted up its little finger, and repeated the word. 
                  "I know," said Louis, as Agnes turned towards him a look, at once of anger and reproach, "that she sleeps; but I have brought glad tidings, and I must awake her to hear them." 
                  "Hush!" said Agnes again; but this time she beckoned him to come nearer, while with one hand she endeavored to direct his attention to the helpless burden she was supporting by the other. 
                  "Look there!" she said, as he drew near. "Look there!" she repeated with clenched teeth, and in a sharp whisper, which seemed to cut a new passage to his brain. 
                  Louis looked as he was directed, for the face of his wife was turned toward the wall, as she lay stretched on a low couch, which appeared to have been drawn to the window, as if for the benefit of more air. Louis looked as he was directed, and beheld-no, it was not sleep, for the eyes were open. It was not death, for there was breath and motion. But, oh! that senseless look-that slight convulsive stir! It was worse than if all had been over. A sudden frenzy seized the wretched man. He kissed her marble brow, already cold and damp, he clasped her powerless hand, he fell upon her bosom; but there was no return-no, not the faintest whisper of a sigh, the slightest dawning of a smile, in answer to the tide of tenderness which his impassioned lips were now pouring into her dull and senseless ear. 
                  "Magdalen! my own Magdalen! you must hear me!" he cried-"Hear me in mercy, if not in love!" and he actually stooped down, until his cheek touched hers, and thus repeated her name, so wildly and so loudly, that, had one spark of consciousness remained, he must have roused it into life. But, no; the fitful and laborious breathing went on just the same, with intervals of longer space; those half-closed eyes stirred not, for they beheld no more the beauty on which they had so often dwelt; and those attenuated lips, now drawn back from the white and prominent teeth-never, never more would they give utterance to words of welcome, or of love. 
                  The husband and the father had time to exist through a life of feeling, before the last of those faint breathings died upon his ear-before the last convulsive movement of the hand startled him for a single second with a lightning flash of hope, and then harrowed up his soul by a slight but strange distortion of that beautiful and perfect form, whose every lineament was wrought in with the loveliest creations of genius. He had time to live through a life of feeling, as he stood there, watching the work of death, and knowing that the master-stroke of destruction had been his own. He had time, for who shall set bounds to the speed of thought, even to call up sweet remembrances of the far-off past-of the dreams-nay, more, of the realities of early love, and these he contrasted with the present scene. Nor was this all. He had time to go on, and on, into the dark and desolate future through which he had to tread alone. He had time to see, as if in a fierce and blazing light, the cruelty and guilt of his own conduct. He had time for everything but repentance. That found no place in his bosom; for its nature is to soften and to heal, and his grief was wild and raving. 
                  How different was the conduct of Agnes. She had done her humble part, to the best of her knowledge and her judgment. She had foreseen the event. She had watched every symptom of decay in the flower which had both bloomed and faded under her care; and although she knew that in the aggregate of duty many things had been left undone, such occasional deficiencies had been made up by the faithfulness and the intensity of her love. Thus she was calm, for what anguish had this hour for her beyond the many she had lived through of previous expectation drawing to one certain close? She was calm, because she had been true; and, therefore, after sitting for a long time in motionless silence beside the couch, with her eyes riveted upon the lifeless form, she rose with dignity and composure to commence the solemn task of preparation for the grave, first leading the wretched husband to a distant apartment, in order that the chamber of the dead might be silent and secure. 
                  But who shall describe the long dark days which followed, each laden with its peculiar burden of sorrow and remorse? Who shall dare to look into the mind of that miserable man, as he paced from room to room, literally seeking rest and finding none; while, sometimes, he would throw himself upon his knees beside the bier, on which that lifeless form was laid, and, giving utterance to his inmost thoughts, would audibly, and in impassioned language, implore her forgiveness of the past, while he promised-and, oh! how deeply and solemnly did he pledge himself to a stricter, holier life, for the future. 
                  On one occasion, especially, taking his child in his arms, and kneeling down, as he had often done before, he uttered, in the presence of Agnes, a fervent and impassioned vow, that, for the sake of that dear charge, and in remembrance of a request his wife had made, he not only never would be guilty of excess again, but no sooner should the child have attained to a knowledge of good and evil, than he would renounce, altogether and for ever, the habit of using, even moderately, what he had so often, to the injury of his temporal and eternal interests, abused. 
                  And so it was, that when weeks, nay, even months, had passed over, this vow was not broken. With this inviolate, and with the burden of grief upon his heart, the sculptor became an altered man-so altered, that the few friends he had left, began to augur hopeful things, and to pronounce again that he would become a distinguished and wealthy man. Nor was this hope without foundation, for his fame was now spreading far and wide. His one great work, though fruitless, as related to the immediate object he had had in view, was productive of a rich harvest of renown; and before the marble had received the last stroke of his chisel, it had already become an object of attraction, not only to his friends, but to all who obtained access to his studio. 
                  For the fame of a distinguished sculptor, the soul of Louis Montreville had thirsted almost since the days of his childhood; and now that the object of his ambition was attained, what was it to him? And where was the delight? Dark-dark, and solitary to him was that old gallery, where he now paced alone, stripped as it was of all its noblest and finest ornaments, to supply the necessities his recklessness had brought upon him; but most of all, its desolation told upon his heart in the loss of that one being, who used to sit there at her father's feet, pouring forth the music of her own full heart, through the poetic language of other lands. 
                  No object was now left as a stimulus for Louis to work, for he found, as all have ever felt, and all ever must feel, that fame was not enough. He waited the kind welcome, the sweet approving smile, the inspiration of the living beauty ever at his side; and when critics and connoisseurs flocked in, and poured their flattering praise on his ear, he would sometimes turn away to dash the unmanly tear-drop from his eye; while, often, as the tide of adulation swelled, he was tempted to exclaim, "Well may that work be worthy of your praise, when it cost the wife of my bosom her precious life!" 
                  Yet, strange to say, after all that had passed, there was not among his acquaintance a truer or kinder friend than old Agnes. It seemed as if her indignant spirit was softened and smoothed down, by some secret influence which death had wrought upon it; and so great was the change in her manner, so studious the care with which she anticipated all her master's wants and wishes, that he not only observed, but felt it; and one day, when they were alone, he ventured to ask her "how it was, that now, when he alone was left to serve-he who had proved himself in every respect so little worthy-she could serve him so faithfully and kindly?" 
                  "It was her dying request," replied Agnes, "that I should do so. She said there would be no one else, when she was gone, to do any little service; and if there was, none understood so well as I did what you liked, and to what you had been accustomed." 
                  "Did she say this of me, Agnes, when I was forgetting her on her deathbed?" 
                  "Yes, sweet soul, she did, and never breathed a murmuring word against you all the time." 
                  "But you should have written to me, Agnes. You should have sent to me express. 
                  "I did write, sir, again and again; but no answer came, and we thought you must have left the place." 
                  "Ah! so it was. I had forgotten. But, Agnes, you must tell me more. for I feel as if I could hear it now. You must tell me what she said about my intemperance-my guilt." 
                  "She said, often and often, poor dear creature, and, sometimes when she thought I was asleep, she made it the subject of her prayers, that she considered that one besetment as the bane of your happiness-the ruin of your soul! 'But I have been to blame,' she would add, 'as well as he. I have not, until now, seen clearly how this temptation should have been met. I have urged him,' said she, 'to give up everything of this description for the sake of the child, so soon as it shall be able to distinguish good from evil; but he must do this before, he must do it now, if he would escape the gulf into which he is sinking.'" 
                  "And she spoke often of the child?" 
                  "Yes; but not so often as of you. 'My darling boy,' she said, 'you will cherish for his own sake, as well as mine,' and she made me promise, which indeed I was nothing loath to do, that I would never leave him while I live; 'but of his father,' she said, 'you have sometimes spoken harshly, and therefore I urge upon you the more that you will never do so again, remembering, however you are tempted for the future, that if you act or speak unkindly to him, you are at the same time wounding the spirit of one, who loved him better than her own life.'" 
                  "And now, sir, if one in my situation may venture to speak on such a subject, I would ask when it is your intention to commence that way of life which she who both knew and loved you so well, implored me on her deathbed, that I would urge upon you as the only way of safety for one tempted as you have been, and no doubt will be again." 
                  "No, Agnes, there you are mistaken. I feel no inclination now. The company, the excitement which once were my delight, are a weariness, a burden to me now." 
                  "Human nature, sir, however it may be circumstanced, is human nature still; and it sometimes happens, that the safer we feel ourselves, the greater is our danger. Besides which, if you begin now, while under no temptation, the trial will be easier than it can be after temptation has begun." 
                  "But, Agnes, I have bound myself by that awful vow. Did you not hear me when I knelt beside her coffin?" 
                  "I did; but he who enters in upon the broad way of destruction, saying, 'I will go so far, and no farther,' is in a very different position from him who turns aside, and will not enter in. Besides which, it is not I who urge it. It is that loved and lost one, who appeals to you again through me. Why then-oh, why will you not listen?" 
                  "I tell you, Agnes, again, it is impossible for me now to fall into excess. I absolutely loathe it." 
                  "Then I too must go back to the same story, and tell you again, that for that very reason, now is your time to begin, by abstaining altogether. Today you are able to do so; to-morrow you may not." 
                  "But my vow is, that I will go no farther than her pure spirit would approve." 
                  "That vow-what is it? A cobweb against a whirlwind! Have I not heard such vows before, and seen them broken? Yes, when health, and wealth, and fame, and happiness, and peace of conscience, all depended upon their being kept." 
                  In this manner that old and faithful servant, her mind full to overflowing with the sacred charge which her beloved mistress had left upon her, ventured to deal with the master whom she still endeavored to serve with as much appearance of reverence and esteem as if those feelings had in reality been implanted in her mind. 
                  And thus, through the long dull days of his solitary existence, the sculptor lived on, without a motive for exertion, and consequently without energy- without excitement, and consequently sad. By degrees, however, his buoyant spirits began to resume their tone. He had health and youth in his favor, and his playful and happy child, the image of its mother, inspired by his own vivacity, would often win him from the sullen mastery of his own dull thoughts, to become himself a child in pastime; when, casting off the burden of his grief, he would echo back that merry laugh of infant gladness, until he almost wondered at the sound, to which he had once imagined it impossible that his lips could give utterance again. 
                  Happy, happy would it have been for Louis Montreville, had this natural indulgence, this joyous pastime, this innocent laugh, been all the tendency he felt to resume the habits most congenial to his taste; but, alas! with reviving cheerfulness, there came so many early-formed associations, so many pleas for rousing himself once more into life and action, as he called the conduct and behaviour of other young men of his class, that before one year of his widowhood had passed over, he was again plunged in, and mixed up with the multitude; and again walked in the ordinary ways of worldly-minded and self-indulgent man. 
                  To many-to most of these, the path they trod was safer than it was to Louis. They could, many of them, meet in social fellowship, and pledge the cheering wine-cup apparently unharmed; but he could not; and while his boon companions lured him on, while pleasure seemed to glow with a sort of charmed atmosphere around him, while men of respectability and talent, with their knowledge and their wit, beguiled him of the heavy burden of his secret thoughts, what wonder that he should fail to perceive the exact boundary between moderation and excess; or having once discovered himself to be on the wrong side of this line, what wonder that he should hurry on to absolute forgetfulness that there were such things as safety and danger, good and evil, in the world? 
                  "It is but once, it is but twice," he would say to Agnes, as the repetition of these excesses awoke her most serious and faithful remonstrances; until their number grew beyond all calculation; until, instead of any distinct and separate acts to which a name or a place might have been assigned, the whole resolved itself into a mass of extravagance and folly-of wretchedness and crime. 
                  And now Agnes saw that the end she had all along predicted was approaching, and that the more rapidly, because there was neither check nor attraction at home. She saw that her master's pecuniary resources must soon fail, and she began to calculate, and to husband her own scanty means, preparatory to taking the entire charge of that more than orphan child, from whom she was determined that nothing should separate her but death. 
                  Yet were there moments when even this lost, wretched man could not "forget himself to stone," when the picture of a young Italian girl, the smile of a rosy child, the notes of a long-remembered melody, would send across his soul a thrill of intense and intolerable anguish, that, had there been but one human bosom still open to receive him, he would have flown, with his guilt, his penitence and his tears, to bury his torment there. Yes, he would have gone, to offer up on this altar the ashes of his crushed and blighted feelings, down into the lowest depths of human degradation, as far as the winds could carry the blessed tidings, that to him there still remained a friend. But, no. There is no real sympathy in the fellowship of guilt; and miserable as he was, and sometimes melted into more than woman's tenderness, his habits and associations were exclusively with men and women of depraved and hardened natures, who, while they despised, were still waiting to make him, as far as he was capable of being so, the tool of their base purposes-the victim of their cruelty and guile. 
                  And was this the man on whom such tenderness had once been lavished? his crouching abject form, the very same form which fair arms had twined? his hair, those mean and meagre locks, the wreath of raven curls which she, the gentle one, would lift from off his brow of beauty, and gazing, lose herself in dreams of bliss? his voice, with all its altered tones, now broken into language no one cares to hear,-oh, it was once a perfect melody to one, whose spirit lived in music, and breathed itself away in love! 
                  Yes, and he remembers all this. He must remember it; for it is the just and inevitable curse of those who have been blest, and would not use their blessings as they ought, that they cannot, if they would, forget that the sweet waters of healing and refreshment, of which they might have partaken in their early life, must still constitute the flood in which their burning lips may bathe, but cannot drink. He remembers all this, and there are moments in which his hand is raised against the life which brings no joy to others, or to himself; but that hand is powerless now. He cannot grasp the weapon-he cannot actually resolve; he can only go and grovel as before, and drown his momentary anguish in unconsciousness again. 
                  And where now is that sweet and happy child? He has grown into a youth of such rare beauty, that even the stranger, passing on his way, stops to look back and see how carefully he guides the steps of the old matron by his side; while, bending with the weight of years, she lays her shrivelled hand upon his shoulder, and traces her accustomed way to an humble dwelling, one of an old and narrow street about to be thrown open to the march of busier feet than tread its dismal passage now. It was a lovely picture, too, and one which might well have arrested the painter's gaze, to see that strange contrast between youth and age-one, beautiful and fresh, and almost noble in its character and bearing; the other, worn and weak, with steps that trembled as if with the consciousness that earth was but a slippery hold for them. 
                  Returning from these walks, which from the feebleness of Agnes were but of rare occurrence, it was the custom of the boy to place her in her chair, and then with his own hands to light their fire, and prepare their humble and often scanty meal; and, reluctant as the aged woman was, to be ministered unto, rather than to minister, from the weight of years, and the shock of many trials, she was now brought down to such a state of feebleness, that submission was her only choice. 
                  Thus the kind-hearted boy repaid his aged parent, as he believed her to be, for all her faithfulness to him, and his; and what was more to be wondered at in one of his sex and years, he did this cheerfully-often looked up into the wrinkled face of his companion, with the very smile his mother wore, and with the vivacity of his other parent, turning into jest and drollery the very expeditions to which he, and his supposed grandmother, had recourse, under the pressure of their many wants and slender means. 
                  With his mother's beauty, the boy inherited her taste for music, and it so happened, that he had found the means of turning this talent to some account, by forming the acquaintance of one who permitted him to practise on his humble instrument. The genius of the father now developed itself in the son, though in a different manner; for music became to him like the food on which he lived; and he probably resigned himself to this passion the more entirely, that the faculties of his mind had never been called forth in any other way. He was in fact without education, and almost without thought; but music was to him a sense, and thousands and tens of thousands of new feelings and new associations began to crowd upon his mind, through this newly-opened channel. 
                  It was on returning home from an evening spent in devotion to this, his only study, that the hitherto thoughtless boy had to prepare for the first affliction of his life. The voice which had always welcomed his return spoke not. The latch of the door was not stirred from within; the fire had died out in the little chamber, and there, stretched on the bed where the aged limbs had at last found rest, lay the lifeless form of his mother's nurse, and his. In the same moment, a sense of his own utter loneliness sunk upon the heart of the affectionate boy, and, falling upon the senseless form, he wept, with the bitterness of an orphan, over his last and only friend. 
                  Such were the feelings which the unremitting tenderness and care of old Agnes had inspired in her otherwise neglected charge, that no means by which a son could have done honor, under such circumstances, to the memory of a mother, were disregarded. A little hoarded money, a few pieces of ancient furniture, had been the property of Agnes, and these were all appropriated to the purpose of giving decent burial to her remains, which the boy himself, as chief-mourner, followed to her last home; and if the tears which fell from his bright eyes, as he stood beside the grave, unnoticed, unrecognised, unpitied, were any test of real feeling, there was more sorrow experienced for that poor aged woman, than for many of those, whose rank and titles herald their passage to the tomb. 
                  And now the friendless boy was indeed alone in the wide world; but his spirit failed him not; for he was young, and having seldom known an ambitious hope, or a wish beyond his daily bread, he betook himself to the practice of his favorite art, and esteemed himself a happy being, when, by the performance of some new melody, he could win the notice of the wealthy, or the fair, who would sometimes look down from their high windows, and smiling on the beautiful Italian boy, as all believed him to be, would sometimes cast a mite out of their abundance at his feet. 
                
               THE END.
