To those who have 'always lived under a free and liberal government, it will perhaps be necehsary, for the better comprehension of our story, to say a few. words in reference to the miserable state of bondage to which the lower classes of England were reduced during the reign of the weak and va-' cillating Sixth Harry-a sovereign possessing many amiable qualities, but of so facile and temporizing a nature, that he was a mere puppet in the hands of his turbulent and ambitious counsellors, at the head of whom were the Duke of Gloster and his aspiring Duchess, while the peace of the kingdom Was hourly threatened by the powerful faction of the Yorkists, headed by the Earl of Warwick. In the times of which we are now writing, there were but two great dis. tinctive classes-the wealthy nobles with their vast estates, and the miser- able serfs or thralls, the natives of the soil-part and parcel of their lords' possessions-and. as much the creatures of his will, power and caprice as were the oxen which tilled his lands, or the hounds with which he chased the game, wherewith his forests abounded. There were, to be sure, certain Implied bounds which were said to mark the degree, continuance and nature of the service which the serf was in duty compelled to render to the lord of the manor upon which he dwelt,--merely because he did. dwell there-but that those laws were altogether one-sided in their operation, any of the earlier pages of England's blood-stained history will too plainly demonstrate. Even- these bounds, could they always have' been enforoqd by the poor bondsman, left him but little which a man would wish to live for. The lords of the soil, as the nobles so arrogantly styled themselves, could compel the attendance of their thralls at any and all times of the day and night-could force from them, by the merciless application of the lash, what- ever service their supreme wills' might choose to claim--could prevent their marriage, or enforce the same if it. pleased their fancies-and, to sum up all     8          -  JACK CADE; OR, in one comprehensive term, could merge the very existence of the slave in the supreme will of his ipd.  Seeing that all these things were conceded as a matter of fight, what, we would ask, was the probability that any atrocity which these powerful tyrants chose to commit, could not be so garbled in its statement or so construed in its perpetration, as not to be embraced in the "reservbd rights" of the barony? And what hope of justice had the poor bondsman left to indulge in, when the judge of his case was invariably found to be the cordial friend and boon companion of his persecutor? Was it at all likely that the one lord would so far weaken the power of their infallible body as to pass a sentence, which should, in granting justice to the serf, reflect upon the con- duct of his master, and thus open a loophole through which the indignant but down-trodden thrall might perceive the faintest gleam of that heaven- born light which guides to Freedom? Surely not. We will admit there were a few estates which were possessed by humane  and considerate lords; men who did not utterly forget that something of justice and consideration was due to the stalwart frames and hardy and willing limbs which had fought their feuds, protected their lands, and pro- duced their revenues; mlen who were not so besotted with their rank and wealth as to conceive that while they rustled it bravely in silks and feathers their retainers ought to starve in their hovels or pine in their castle's dun- geons, under the capricious and tyrannical sway of unworthy stewards or revengeful bailifh. Alas! these men were few, and serve only as foils to reflect the greater enormities of their confreres. Having made these few remarks in explanation of the relative positions of the two great classes of society in England at the time of which our story treats, we will now proceed to introduce somne of our characters to the reader. CHAPTER II. IN the county of Kent, one of the most populous and wealthy of England's baronies, and situated at the south-eastern extremity of the kingdom, stood the lofty and strongly-fortified castle of the Lord Say, the tyrannical, exact- ing, and spendthrift lord treasurer of the realm. Trusting more to the number ofhis defences and the impregnability of his position, than to the affection of his numerous vassals, he had spared no pains or expenra to fortify a position, originally strong by nature, with all the then known appli- ances of art. Notwithstanding his seeming security, this wealthy but miser- able lord was over haunted with {he fear of some sudden and swift vengeanee falling upon his guilty head, in just retribution for the innumerable and unheard-of cruelties he had inflicted upon his unfortunate dependants, not one of v hom but could relate some tale of oppression, or rehearse some set of injustice of which he had been the object. It was matter of notoriety all round the country, that numerqrs viotim to his lust, cruelty, aid avariee were pining in the noisome dungeons of his-   THE BONDSMAN'S STRUGGLE.           9 istonghold, and wasting the li' bestowed upon them by their Maker in venting curses upon their tyrait-persecutor, who, it vas said, sometimO visited their prisons for the solq purpose of feeding his malice by contem- plating the sufferings they alreaidy endured, and devising new modes of aggravating the horrors of their position. It is not for a moment to be supposed that Lord Say was unaided or unadvised in these acts of tyranny. No, far from it; he, at least, fully re- alized the fact, that when oppression seeks an agent, one can ever be found in the very ranks of those whom he is called upon to make the subjects of his master's malice. None are so ready-to aid the oppressor as he who has till now consorted with the oppressed. It is the leaven in mens' base nature, which will ever be found ready, in consideration of lucre- and preferment, to prompt them to raise their hands and lend their tongues against their fellow men. And woe betide the hapless wight who comes under the tyranny of these petty despots, for none are more prone to exercise their authority with merciless sway than those whose position was hitherto base and lowly.  Such a man as we have been describing was the Steward of the Castle, the Major Dome of the lordship, Say's base pander and minion.-Caleb Courtnay, as styled by his master, Caitiff Oourtnay as designated by the miserable serfs who came within the scope of his powerful malice, or fell under the ban of his capricious humor. This man, by nature servile, cunning, and avaricious, had long been the remorseless agent for executing the arbitrary acts of Lord Say's powerful will, and never had he been known to fail in accomplishing the wishes of his master, did they relate to the capture of a maiden, the imprisonment of an enemy, or the appropriation of some coveted treasure. Of course, a miscreant such as Caitiff Oourtnay was not without enemies, men who, if not powerful, were at least numerous; and oft did the wretch's soul sink within him as he contemplated th4 moody brows, and listened to the half-murmured threats that ever and anin greeted the approach of their merciless tormentor. Among those who were most forward in this display of heir detestation, and least guarded in the expressions of their wrath, were a refugee from Ireland named Cade, a yeoman named-Worthy, and a bondsman by the name of Straw; these three men, though of different ranks in life, were of similar dispositions, and were united by one bond of fellowship, having sworn upon one common altar-that of their country's wrongs-to endeavor to redress a portion of the grievances under wlich they were made to suffer. As the former of these men was the father of the hero of our story, we shall devote a few words to informing our readers of some particulars respecting his family and position at the time which we have chosen to bring him upon the stage of action. The elder (ade was a native of Ireland, where he was born in the year 1890, and in which country he had continued to live until the invasion of that island by the Duke of York, at which time he was 'f man of some \. ...          j   .  .     10            JACK CADE; o0(i) wealth and the happy husband of an affectionate wife, and father of a dutiful son and daughter. As Cade naturally enough conceived that his property would be more safe if he took sides with the conqueror, he shrewdly enough embraced the'cause of the Yorkist leader, and permitted his son John, or Jack--ashistory terms him-to render his youthful service to the Duke, while he himself shortly retired from the scene of strife, and removed his family to the maritime county'of Kent, which spot he was induced to choose from the fact of its lying nearer the continent than any other part of the Island of Great Britain, thus affording more easy means of escape, no small consideration in the eyes of-a prudent man and affectionate husband and father, in the troublous times of which we speak. Cade had not long been a resident under the feudal tenure of Lord Say, ere he became fully aware of the despotic character of his lord, and the baseness of the instrument he employed to carry out his oppressions. As the property which' he had accumulated in Ireland had been partly invested in the purchase of a small piece of land which he held in fief; that is, for the possession of which he not only paid money, but was also to grant certain service to the lord of the soil, his situation elevated him somewhat above the thralls or bondsmen upon whom the Caitiff Courtnay exercised the workings of his malicious and cowardly disposition. But the Steward was not a man who could long brook the presence of one who, though a tenant of his lord, was not included in the list of those over whom he could tyrannize with uncontrolled malice, and he therefore set all his cunning to work to contrive some devilish device, by which he might bring Oade under the displeasure of his lord, which he well knew, if once aroused, would soon lead to all those consequences which he yearned to. see entailed upon the proud and haughty yeoman, for such was the rank of the man whom he had chosen to consider his enemy. There was one incentive to this bitterness on the part of this vile mis- creant, which we have not yet dwelt upon. We have said Cade possessed a daughter-a daughter doubly dear to the father's heart, from her own goodness, and from the fact that she was alone left to welcome his return at even, and bid him God speed at matsp song. His sotn Jack being absent in Ireland, fighting under the banners f York's potent duke, who had more than once commended the bravery an manly daring of the youthful soldier, the lovely Grace was the glad recipient of all her parents' love, and was watched and guarded with a solicitude which was warranted by the re- markable beauty of her form and face, as well as the unrestrained passions and powerful wh which her father knew full well to be the characteristics of his lord.  Now it so happened that the vile passions of Courtnay had been aroused by the contemplation of the fair features of the beautiful Grace; he loved her not, for natures like his arq not capable of feeling such a heaven-born- influence; no, it was not love that thus stirred his inward soul; it was but the workings of unbridled passion which caused his hot blood to run riot through his distempered carcase, and led him frequently to throw himself in    'fSlE BONDSMAN'S STRUGGLE. -        " the path of her whose bad fortune it was to have attracted the attention of the vile Caitiff.  At first, when they encountered each other, the Steward had assimeQ a ,oft and fawning mien, and merely spoke of the charms of Nature,/the odfr of the flowers, or the sweet songs of the feathered minstrels; to these remarks the modest and retiring Grace could but in courtesy reply as, their substance warranted. But even this it seems was condescending too much; for the boldibad man, presuming upon her mildness, and led on by the mad passion which was consuming him, dared to insult her ears by bireathing into them the base proposals which had more than once been compulsively listened to by those who dared not gainsay the will of this petty tyrant. Not so did the proud and lovely Grace succumb to this bold wooer, but even as she listened did her flashing eyes and dilated nostrils speak the scorn which had been thus called into existence, while yet she knew not that it slumbered in her tranquil bosom. Inferring her answer from her defiant looks, the unabashed Oourtnay thus addressed her: What means the peasant Grace by spurning an oflir which Iany a lady- born would not blush to accept? Knows she not that I am omnipotent here; that I am he before whom all bend' in lowly fear; that I am Courtnay, the Steward of the noble Say?" M "Wiscrcautl"  replied the indignant and outraged girl, "' bandy not words with me, who value not your name nor place, which, beshrew me, comport. well with the base nature that prompts you thus to insult a yeoman's daughter. You are, an' I mistake not the words which all men speak when the loathed subject claims their angry voice, the Caitiff Steward of an unjust Lord,-the base- pander to his vicious -pleasures, the unscrupulomu agent of his vile oppressions  Begone, nor dare insult my cars by further speech, lest I invoke upon your guilty headbthe full weight of an indignant father's arm." "INay, fair one, we part not thus-for here  ear that re the vile peasant who breeds such angry snakes, seducing us with their bright eyes and yet stinging us with. their hissing tongues, shall behold again his cherished pet, thou shalt have become that loathed thing which now thy tongue fears to speak, lest its passage should blister those pouting lips, from whose ruby sweetness I promise to quaff such deep draughts of bliss as thy churlish sire ne'er dreamed to dwell upon thy balmy breath's unguarded portals." - While uttering these last words the enraged Courtnay had advanced menacingly towards the apparently helpless object of his wrath, and as he closed the sentence he threw one arm around her waist and endeavored to smother her voice by placing his disengaged hand upon her mouth. To his surprise the fair captive neither atruggled, screamed, nor fainted, but apparently yielding to the force of circumstances, permitted him partly to carry, partly to drag her somewhat further into the thicket, upon the verge of which the previous dialogue had been held. Regarding this passiveness on the part of Grace as highly favorable to his intentions, the rascal had conceived the idea of consummating his wicked     JACK CADE; OR, purpoie in the very thicket into which they were now penetrating, so fr ildging his captive as to suppose that he would find in her no unwilling 'ifner to the love-tale he had to tell; and in this belief he attributed- her previous haughty looks and language to that feeling which prompts all females to assume some show of modesty, even if they have it not. Oh I how desperately was this man deceiving himselfl Could he have looked beneath that apparently calm face and within that passive frame, he would there have beheld such a tempest of passion as might have coweo. even the most determined wrong-geeK'\ Grace knew it was of no use to oppose her feeble strength [against this powerful ruffian; neither did she deem it wise to raise her voice in cries for help, as, while there was small chance of her voice reaching the ears of her father or his friends Straw and Worthy, she might only bring those around her who would be willing to purchase immunity for their next offence, by aiding their general tyrant in his present nefarious proceeding. These thoughts flashed through the brain of the ufortunate girl with the speed of lightning, and she quickly conceived a line of conduct which, to be successful, required no small degree of resolution and assumed submisionm - parting with her brother on the sunny fields of Ireland, where their ffars had been so happily spent, and where their affections had been so mutually developed, she had listened lng and lovingly to his words of advice;-for Jack Cade had ever, been apreuocious youth, exhibiting a wisdom far beyond his years. It was then her brother had told her of the troublous times in England, how the noble tyrannized over the serf, and how the ,wealthy oppressed his poorer fellow man; how neither law nor justice were to be reckoned among the rights of man, but were to be bought only by the highest bidder. But when, breaking off from these general topics, her brother spoke of herself, her beauty, the temptations to which she would be subject, it was then that she vowed never to disgrace the stock from whence she sprung, nor sully the honor of a family whom she had been taught by her father to believe was of loftier descent than his who now ruled the destinies of England. Xtwas at this moment, while her eyes, lit up with sudden brilliance, rested upon the noble countenance of her brother, that he took from his bosom a jewel-hilted dagger, and presenting it to Grace, bade her neverdpart with it, but cherish it next her heart, for that it would befriend her when all other means of aid had failed. With what heartfelt thankfulness to that dear brother did the now re- solved Grace clutch convulsively the dagger which wet to prove her rescue from a fate worse than that of death. Permitting the eager and exulting Steward to convey her deeper into the thicket, with every path of which her love of nature had made her. aoquainted, she offered neither struggle nor-entreaty, knowing that the further they were removed from the road, less likely would he be to obtain assis- tance; for she rightly guessed that power has more friends than weakness; and that if she wished to escape his base pollution she herself must prove her own defender.   THE BONDSMAN'S SlTRiUGLR.           13 ourtnay having at length attained a spot he deemed removed from chance intrusion, relaxed his hold upon the maiden's form, and compelling her to seat herself upon a grassy mound, reclined himself at her feet, drink- ing in as it were those beauties which he had resolved so basely to despoil of their brightest jewel. "What thinls now the lovely Grace of the potency of her will or of the lofty ebullitions of her scorning tongue; deems she that I who never yet brooked denial, am to be schooled by a peasant girl, who has not wit enough to bless her lucky stars nor grace enough to thank the man who helps her to better fortune, despite her wayward fancies?" Grace, whose fingers twitched convulsively the handle of the dagger which as yet she had not nerve enough to draw from its resting place, merely smiled in scorn upon the man who sought to win her favor by instancing the potency of his will and by recounting the deeds of violence with which he had marked his fervency of love. v This state of inactivity suited not long the turbulent passions that were raging in the bosom of Courtnay, and which urged him on to make more active demonstrations of his intentions towards the quiet but not unresol- ved Grace. She awaited only the proper opportunity to rid herself of his hated presence by proceeding to those extreme measures forwhioh her brother had so fortunately prepared her. Courtnay, feeling now that it was useless to dally with his fair victim, suddenly sprung up, and clasping her form in his passionate embrace, invaded the sanctuary of her neck and bosom with his burning kisses, and was proceeding to yet greater liberties when Grace, nerved to desperation by such rlufian treatment, sudddnly drew the weapon from its concealment, and er te e lustful Steward could anticipate the quick movement of her upraised arm, the glittering weapon descended with no small force upon his exposed breast, and its finely-tempered point found a resting place in the neighbourhood of the villain's heart. Overcome by the suddenness of the attack and the pain arising from his wound, this valiant betrayer of woman's honor was in no fit condition'to offer opposition to the flight of Grace, who no sooner saw her enemy stnk beneath her blow, than she hastened home to her father, resolving to dis- patch some one to the assistanec of the discomfitted scoundrel. Such is ever the contradictory nature of gentle woman-wound them in their most vulnerable point; assail them by the most powerful engines of offence, wrong them in:their deepest-seated affections--still their heaven-born nature prompts them to forgive their injurer and forget the wrong he has so foully wrought. Thus was it with the gentle Grace; though conscious that the wound she had inflicted, and the pain consequent upon it were richly deserved by Caitiff, and had been .her only means of escape, still her woman's hear0re- gretted the necessity of the act, and she fled forward with all the speed she could to enlist her father's aid to reecue the wounded man from the penalty of his bad conduct.     "           JACK CADE; OB, Arrived at home,'Grace stayed not to detail the circumstances of the case, but breathlessly informed her father that Oowrtnay was in the Home Grove, bleeding to death, and urged npon him hi'n immediate departure to render him assistance. The elder (ade, though, as may be supposed,-b {lhd but little sympathy with the vile minion of the Castle, yet thus nrgSe, could not resist that sympathy which is ever a dweller in the brave manl nature, and hurriedly departed to perform his daughter's behest.  On his way to the spot described by his daughter, Cade encoumtered his friend Straw, whom he prevailed upon to accompany him, and thus the two hurried to the Home Grove, designated as the place where the wounded Courtnay was breathing out his base existence. Ere many minutes had elapsed they found the wounded mai, who though writhing in pain was still able to swear vengeance against the perpetrator of what he was pleased to term the assassin blow.  It will be remembered that Grace in her flight taried not to withdraw the weapon from the woind, but having struck the blow hastened home- wards. Now, it so happened that the initials of Cade were engravced upon the handle, and Oourtnay perceiving this, his ready 'wit, even in this hour did not desert him, and he resolved to lay the crime upon the father instead of the daughter, and having by this means deprived her of her protector, he shrewdly guessed that she would prove an easy prey. This scheme was but half-hatched in his busy brain, when the arrival of Oade and Straw, seemed a most fortuitous circumstance to enable him to nmatire his plot, Although both Straw and Worthy, had long been marked men, yet it served not his present purpose to involve Straw in Cade's punishment; he therefore dispatohed the former in search of assistance, hoping in the mean- while that some circumstance might arise by which he could fix the odium of the transaction upon the father of the girl, whose ruin he had now more than ever resolved upon. During the absence of Straw, Courtnay endeavored to learn from Cade hb-much he had been informed of by his daughter, and it was with the ' -mat fiendish delight he discovered that the noble girl had concealed from her father how deeply he had sought to wrong his child. Upon this knowledge the Oaitiff resolved to build the downfall of Cade, and hearing at a distance the sounds of horn and hounds, he knew that a party from the Castle, who had been hunting in the neighbourhood were approaching. Quickly did he form a plan which was but too successful. He requested Cade to withdraw the weapon from the wound, and at the same time help him towards the sounds, which were now evidently but a short distance from them.  With the former request the honest yeoman immediately complied, little dreaming that the dagger he for the first time clutched in his honest gripe. bore either cypher or mark that could bring him into danger. On removing the weapon from Oortnay's breast, a stream of blood spirted e   THE BONDSMAN'S STRUCGGLE.          15 rth, which completely deluged the arm and bosom of'Cade, and gave him every appearance of an assassin; a charge which the base plotter so devoutly wished to fix upon him. Scarce had Cade -wiped from his face the ensanguined hue, ere A party of huntters rushed to the spot, whither they were attracted by a loud exclama- tion from the Steward, who had summoned all his fleeting energies fMr the successful carrying out of his plot. No sooner did these hunters gaze upon the scene that met their-astonished. ght, than their warped judgments quickly jumped to the conclusion that the favorite minister to their vices had been waylaid and attacked by Cade, who, it was well known, looked upon him with no friendly eye. When we consider for a moment the position of the parties, we must confess that this appeared to be a very probable solution of the scene. Hero we behold a man, known to have many enemies, weltering in his blood, while beside him stands one of those enemies holding aloft a bloody dagger, while his hands and clothes aro saturated with the tell-tale evidence of his guilt. As if these circnmstancesowere not loud enough in his condemnation, to these are now added the bitter but feebly-articulated denunciations of the wounded man, who, in corroboration of the charge, calls attention to the fact, that the dagger Cade still mechanically retained in his grasp was. not ordy his, but was so unmistakably proved to be his property that it bore his initials carved on its jewelled hilt. Cade, who had hitherto boldly confronted his accuser, conscious of his in- nocence, now turned his eyes upon the ensanguined weapon, and there, as if in very mockery of his senses, stood forth in bold relief the fatal letters that marked it for his own.  In. vain the wretched man rubbed his eyes and brought the weapon nearer to his maddened gaze; there, there he beheld those condemning characters which he knew not how to explain to himself, nor how to account for to others.' Overcome by this astonnding fact, Cade allowed himself to be bound by his captors and ignominiously conveyed to the castle, while another party, with Say at their head, ministered to the wants of the now exhausted Steward, whom they placed upon a hastily-formed litter, and carried with slow and careful step to the same frowning fortress where but now his victim had arrived, and by-its lord's stern comrpands been thrust into the deepest and most noisome of its dungeons. (HAPTER   III. DAim CADE, having assisted in expediting her husband on his ill-starred errand of mercy, and with all a wife's fondness watched his departing steps, as he strode rapidly off in the direction of the Home Grove, now turned into the house and sought her daughter Grace, in order to learn from her     16           JACK CADE; OR, the particulars of the catastrophe in regard to which, hadshe proved less curious, she would have been no true daughter of Eve.  On entering the neat and cleanly-swept room in which!they were accus- tomed to pass those hours not occupied in the more active duties of the household, Dame Bertha. was surprised to find it untenanted, as she had there fully expected to meet her daughter. The good and now somewhat anxious old lady hastened o mount the few stairs leading to Graced' own bed-room, not doubting but that the fatigue of her walk had induced her to rest herself on the lowly palet on which she had been wont to sleep through the calm nights of so maby happy years. On gaming the room, what was the fond mother's grief itnd astonishment to find her dearly-beloved child tossing upon the couch, convulsed with such spasmodic grief as deprived her for the time of all power ofutterance. In vain her mother sought to soothe her into somesort of tranquillity. Deep-drawn sobs and scalding tears were the sole reply that Grace vouch - safed to the tender and earnest inquiries of the much disquieted Bertha. Well and wisely has it been ordained that grief must ere long exhaust itself, and that our sorrow be it ever so deep, or our woes be they over so numerous, time must assuage them. Thus was it with Grace; after a few hours she became more calm; and having first inquired if her father had returned, and joined her mother in wondering and fearing at his prolonged absence, she detailed the outlines of the danger she had run, and the bloody means she had been compelled to adopt to secure her escape. Our readers may well suppose that the tender mother listened with the most soul-wrapt eagerness to the exciting story of her daughter's wrongs, while at the close of the relation tears of thankfulness streamed down the matron's cheeks a. she thought of the protecting Providence which had baffled the designs of the base knave who sought to inflict such a blight upon the happiness of a family who had never injured him in thought or deed.                       ,  It was now that both mother and daughter began to tremble for the safetyj  of the loved husband and father.       ./  What danger mighthe not run, what crime might not the baffled SteWar d; be tempted to commit to wreak his vengeance upon the father of her who had wounded him in both body and mind? It was while occupied in painting to themselves all sorts of dangers that might surround the absent Cade, that they were suddenly startled by the* sound of heavy steps in the lower room.  Hastily closing the door of her daughter's chamber, the sorely-beWldered dame hurried down to learn the nature of the intrusion; for herl eaSluio- ened by all a wife's affection,-had soon marked the step as beloning to other than her husband.  On entering the room, she wa- hurriedly and confusedly greeted both Straw and Wotthy, whose tell-tale countenances, despite of all their Iriendly efforts to the contrary, spoke of some sad misfortune which their tongues refused to tell. ,     , t              ..   . .-   ' rPIE BONDSMAN' 8 STR GGOE.         7 Straw was the foremost to speak, and the first words he uttered were in inquiry for Grace; and on learning that she was up stairs and but ill at ease, he urgently cautioned the dame to keep strict watch that she left not the sheltering roof, as there were those abroad who bore the maiden no good will. To this advice the yeoman Worthy also added his voice, and promised to dispatch a score of his stalwart knaves to protect the cottage from assault during the absence of the captive Oade. It was now dame Bertha's turn to demand why all this solicitude, what dire misfortune had befallen them; where was her husband-where was their protector, where was the father of her children?  In vain the two men strove to evade the question. An answer must be given, and that right speedily.   h  It was then that the friendly yeoman, with all the consideration he could call to his aid, and withlall the softening circumstances with which he could est the melancholy narration, informed the agonized wife that the base betrayer of her daughter, the vile Caitiff of the Castle, had accused Cade of murder, and that the noble father and husband now tenanted one of those deer dungeons, the horrors of which furnished food for all the gossip-mongers of the country. What pen shall describe the despair of the wretched woman at this announcement. Her grief could not be restrained, but vented itself in loud and bitter groans of deepest anguish, resounding not only through the room in which she was, but reaching the ears of her afflicted daughter, who now flew on the wings of affection to learn the cause of her mother's deep grief, and to endeavor to calm it'by a daughter's love. It was then that Grace learned the circumstances of her father's seizure, and the base falseLood of the man who had dared to so grossly insult her. It was from Straw she learned the fatal fact of the dagger being proved to be her father's from its bearing his initials, a circumstance oven Straw could not account for, as he knew full well that Cade could not have inflicted the blow; and, moreover, he did not believe he possessed such a weapon as that with which Courtnay had been wounded. It was now Grace's turn to explain, which she did in few words, but with burning cheeks and flashing eye; for though her innate modesty shrank from the narrative, yet she could not but glory in the justice of the blow she had struck. Dame Cade having partially exhausted the first violence of her grief, they now united in consultation as to what was best to be done. What ought to be attempted, and what precautions taken to provide against any further aggression on the part of those at the Castle. Although Courtnay was known to be unable to work them any wrong at present, as he was completely disabled by his wound and loss of blood, yet it was much to be feared that the merciless Say would seek some speedy vengeance upon all concerned in his minion's attempted murder, as he wag pleased to term it. After many plans had been thought of and rejected, it was finally resolved that Grace should on the morrow present herself at the Castle and demand     18            JACK CADE; OR, an audience of its tyrant lord; and that she should there narrate the whole, circumstances of her seizure by Courtnay, his foc9ible abduction of her into the Home Grove, his base designs, and her own offence in daring to raise her woman's arm against the insolent miscreant. Alas, these who anticipated the chance of a happy iLsue to this plan little knew the wolfish nature of Say and his vile companionsor they had never consented to trust this gentle lamb within reach of their ravenous fangs.  It having been decided that on the morrow both Straw and Worthy should come early to the Cottage to act as an escort for th brave girl, whq thus resolved to plead her fathers cause, even in the halls ot that very castles the entrance within whose walls had proved the downfall of many an unsusj pecting maiden, the friends separated for the night, bidding each other hop4, even though it were against hope; for each, though not willing to confcss 3 to his fellow, had powerful misgiving of thl rosult of theeterprise.                  4 OHAPTER IV. FAnw shone the sun o'er hill and dale as Grace, awaking from an unrefresh- ing sleep, troubled as it had been with dreams of dark and fearful import, rose from her lowly pallet, and, as had ever been her wont from childhood up, knelt in earnest prayer to him whom she had been taught to regard as the wise director of all earthly affairs, and into whose hands she now colm- mitted the cause of her dear father, and whose blessing she prayerfully in- voked upon the means she was about to use to restore him to the bosom of his family. Comforted, if not assured by this act of devotion, the fearless girl arrayed herself in a neat and simple costume, as beseemed a yeoman's daughter of the time of which we write, and when her t'ilette was completed, present; ed a picture of health and beauty which atpainter might have joyed to 'contemplate. Albeit her cheek was somewhat pale, anid her dark eyes had lost a portion of their brightness, yet there still lingered sufftiient brilliancy of both cheek anid eye, to mark her as of no ordinary beauty. Her whiteland swan-like neck, her small but finely-formed head, the majestic sweep of the lower limbs, and the well-turned ankle, terminated by a foot of the most approved proportions, might not only have called i question, the appropriateness of the condition she assumed as her birthright, but afforded ample testimony of her claim to the lofty positibn to which we shall hereafter see she might hive rightfully aspired. Descending to the room in which the family were wont to partake their morning's meal, Grace found her mother sadly contemplating the vacant chair, which, urged -by the force of long habit, the wife had placed at the head of that table which the affectionate husband and fathef had so often cheered by his benignant smiles and loving words. Now, alas! what was the lot of that worthy ma? Aooused of a crime,   THE BONDSMAN'S STRUGGLE.          1 against which his very soul revolted, torn from the bosom of his despairing family, plunged into a noisome dungeon, with darkness all around him, and reptiles of the most revolting description for his companions, what had he not to dread from the injustice of his accuser and the irresponsible tyranny of him in whose toils he was  Surely here was the very acme of horrors. Enough to subdue the strong- est mind and unnerve the m6st resolute will. But these, terrible as they were, would have sunk into utter insignificance beside the one great evil, which fortunately the miserable man had not the knowledge of. Had Cade but dreampt that the beauty of his daughter was the mainspring which set this infernal machinery in motion, and that his death was to be the signal for her ruin, then would he have realized the full measure of his woes. This appalling knowledge was most mercifully withheld, and he contem- plated his present position but as the result of pitiful vengeance on the patir of the Caitiff Courtnay, in return for the proud disdain with which he had evier repelled his advances.  Dame Cade having greeted her daughter with a mother's affectionate embrace, and kissed again and again those tearful eyes, which could not:' restrain the scalding drops with which her own soon mingled, urged upon her the necessity of well considering the magnitude and peril of the task she had assigned herself, entreating her to reflect upon the character of the man into whose presence she was, all unsought, about to intrude, and remind- ing her that many'a long hour was oft wiled away by thrall and bondsmaan in listening to the dismal tale of maiden's wrongs with which the frowning towers of Castle Say were known to be associated. "Why, mother dear, thy fears hath made thee unjust alike to thyself and me  Thinkest thou that Say and all his base companions to boot, could BO o'ermaster even this feeble frame that strength should not be left to ddend that honor which my father and thyself hath ever taught was the priceless gem the loss of which were worse than death?" ' Nay, Grace, I deemed not that thou wouldst e'er provo false to those teachings which it has been our purpose as well as our duty to instill into thy youthful mind, but thou art all too pure to guess the wiles with which the wary hunter gilds the gin his skilful hands hath set to snare the feet of maidens such as thou; or, 'scaping these, thou reck'st not of the feeble force thou couldst oppose to wills whose strength of purpose but with opposition stronger grows." "Now, cheer thee, mother mine, this Say whose presence soon i seek, is of the nobles of our land, and cannot be the thing that springs from meaner clay,'for well I do remember my father oft hath pleased mine own and brother's ears with mention of such deeds of greatness and chivalric daring as could not owe their source to blood thit flowed in veins of less exalted state."  4"Beshrew me, now, the girl, hath but illy read the moral to the tale she half but conned, when thus she greets mine ears with words that well might blister lips of flatterers such as the base Steward yonder, who earns his daily bread by servile cringing to the clay which were no better than himself, nor     20           JACK CADE; OR, yet so good, were he but honest as he's not.

Straw, taking upon hijmself the office of spokesman, informed their ques- tioner that the maiden-the daughter of the yeoman Oade,-was there for redress of wrongs, and demanded an audience of their liege. The attendant unused alike to both the manner and the matter of the message, was something loth to deliver it, not eactly knowing how it might be received, or what reception its bearer might meet with. Worthy seeing that the man was in no hurry to depart, beckoned him aside, and after a few moments' whispered conversation, they had the satis- faction of seeing the man move off in the direction of Say's banquetting room. Both Grace and Straw looked inquiringly at Worthy, as if to discover by what talisman he had worked so great a miracle, as to induce a retainer of the Castle to deliver any message in which was to be found the word "demand " coupled with those of " redress of wrongs." But Worthy merely smiled as he perceived their looks of wonderment, and, ahrugging his shoulders, left the mystery for some future time or occasion to nravel. Now it so happened that the Lord Say was in one of his most joyous moods on the morn in question. He had been the previous day successful   THE1 BONDSMAN S STRUGGLE.         : Cade swears to punish the Betrayer of his Sister, whose deathbed he secretly visits. in hunting, unresisted in wooing, and lucky at play; three of the chief things he lived for, in fact the only things he thought worth living for, and all and each of which had been indulged in till they had becomin passions, -for the gratification of any one of which he was at all times ready to sacrifice his best friends, his most darling schemes, or his most valued treasures. Behold this selfish lord, then, sitting at the head of the banqueting hall, before him a table loaded with all the viands which were in those days con- sidered necessary for the due discussion of the morning's meal. In the centre appeared the enormous boar's head, without which no meal was deemed perfect. Beside this was a barbecued hog, flanked with a baron of beef, and surrounded by peacocks, turkeys, pheasants, and birds of all known gastronomic value. While flesh, fish, and fowl were duly varied by fruits, vegetables, and foaming tankards, for even at these demi-royal feasts, the wine cup was not an ordinary accompaniment till a later hour of the day. On the right of Say sat his friend and coiin-the Lord Clifford, while on his left was Beaufort, the Cardinal Bishop of Winchester, and occupying 2      22           JACK CADE; OR, seats more or less removed from their entertainer, were to be seen the Duke of Buckingham, IEd Scales, Governor of the Tower, and many others of note and power, whose influence Say was anxious to command, and whose purses he was as eager to lighten. Their conversation had but just turned on the subject of Cade, and the attempted murder of Courtnay, which Say swore terribly to avenge, when the attendant usher informed his master that a messenger was without who craved speech of the noble lord. Permission being given, the half-terrified retainer bent lowly down at his master's feet, and in that grovelling attitude delivered himself of the some- what defiant message which Grace, through the medium of Master Straw, had charged him to convey. Hastily starting from his half-recumbent) position, and spurning with his indignant foot the kneeling coward before him, Say for a few moments strode up and down the tesselated hall, with hasty and irregular steps, while his quickly changing countenance gave ample token of the storm of wrath which had been aroused. Having at length become more calm, the ruffled lord seated himself at the board, and craving pardon of his noble guests for the indulgence of his sudden wrath, with therm discussed the manner of answer he should return to so fair yet bold petitioner. Now it suited the whim of these most noble gentlemen,-lords of Church and State-that this simple maiden should be had before them, that they might judge by her bearing and language, whether it were possible for a low- born peasant to come within the circle of so much nobility as was there assemblD and yet presume to prate of wrongs, and claim redress thereof. This being decided upon, the man who had brought the message which had so stirred the bile of his puissant lord, and who still stood trembling at a distance, was commanded to conduct the rebellious daughter of the assassin' Cade into the presence of the august personages there assembled; an at his peril was he bid to Lee that she entered unattended. CHAPTER V.  WHILE this was the position of affairs at the castle, other matters claim our attention, though somewhat removed from the scene to which we have hitherto in great measure confined ourselves. It will be remembered that the young Cade, the 'JACK COADE" of history and the hero of our story, was engaged in Ireland fighting under the vic- torious banners of the Duke of York, whither the said nobleman had been despatched, at the joint instigation of the Cardinal Beaufort, Primate of England, and the Duke of Suffolk, at the head of a large and well-appointed L army, for the ostensible purpose of quelling an incipient rebellion in that unfortunate island-unfortunate from the moment that, by divisions and cabals among its own Freeborn sons, it had laid itself open to the bold and avowed attacks of England's arms, or succumbed beneath the hidden snares   THEr BONDSMAN'S STRUlGGLE.          23 and masked policy of a government whose iron haud has been laid upon the wretched country with such oppressive weight that it has sunk under the irresistible burden, and has at length become as it were the very skeleton of its former self, with scarce sufficient of its salient points preserved to indicate the beauty of the form it once possessed, or give token of the energy which existed in its heroic bosom, England,-as we remarked in a previous chapter, was at this time tossed with intestine factions, and agitated to its very centre by the cabals of the various ambitious leaders of the different parties. Of these, the Duke of York was certainly the best beloved, and most popular with the'common people; and, it being shrewdly suspected by the peers that he had fixed his eyes with coveting gaze on England's crown, it was deemed of first importance to remove him to a distance, where his popu- larity would less avail either to further his own views, or impede the designs of others. Now York was not a man that could be either suddenly or easily removed friom the path which others sought to tread alone. Some bold measure or tempting enterprise must be the lure with which to bait the snare into whose n meshes he was to fall; and therefore was it resolved to place him at the head of a powerful army, and giving him the supreme command, secure King Henry's orders for the invasion of Ireland, which had of late made, bold "To temper clay with blood of Englishmen." As in the game of chess, so in that of life, it often nappens that, while solely intent upon making our own moves, and approaching with stealthy steps the goal at which we aim, we suddenly find ourselves check-mated by a coup-de-main of our bolder adversary. Things it fell out with the Beaufort faction. While bent only on removing the Duke, who was a stumbling-block in their ambitious path, they lost sight of the immense weapon they were placing in his hands, should he ever turn it against their defenceless breasts. Not so with York; he was a far-seeing and politic man, not easily hood- winked by the seeming good will of his noble friends; but he lent himself to their views, inasmuch as by so doing he knew he was most sensibly advanc- ing his own bold projects. Shakspeare Ibath most powerfully expressed the thoughts whi lihe supposed might be uppermost in the Duke's mind, when Suffolk promised to have all the men ready within fourteen d4ays to embark for Bristol. Here is his soliloquy:- "Well, nobles, well, 'tis politicly done, To send me packing with a host of men; I fear me, you but warm the starved snake Who, cherished in your breasts, will sting your hearte. 'Twas men I lacked, and you will give them me; - I take it kindly, yet be well assured You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands." With this feeling at his heart, and these proud thoughts in his breast did     24           JACK CADE; OR, York set out, leaving behind him the three great elements of a nation's ruin -a weak king, powerful nobles, and an oppressed people. Among those who had entered the service of the Duke, and by acts of especial daring made themselves a name for bravery, was, as we before re- marked, young Cade, whose good luck it had been to preserve the life of his leader, when struck from his horse by the stalwart arm of one of Erin's most powerful defenders. Quickly dismounting from his own steed, the gallant young man had not only helped to place the Duke thereon, but had presented his own body as a buckler to ward off the numerous blows w1iich were aimed-at the head of the discomfitted Duke. Cade, though not unwounded, had fortunately been successful in his general's defence, and realized the satisfaction so dear to the soldier's heart, that of knowing he had that day done a deed which would be both sung in  song and related in story; for those were the times when bold deeds found ready words in the lays of the gifted mninstrels, whose harps were ever wel- come in tented-field or castle-hall. From henceforth Cado was selected as the chosen attendant, and not  unfrequent confidant of the Duke's leisure hours; for though his birth pre- vented the bestowal of that military ranfl his soul yearned for, still, the powerful Richard disdained not to treat with marked friendship one who had proved himself a staunch defender and zealous servant. It hls been intimated that York's Duke had cast a longing eye upon the golden bauble which encircled the still youthfidl brows of the feeble Henry; and it may be added, that though he himself was absent, yet were his in- terests powerfully supported by the leading nobles of England. Himself descended from the popular house of Mortimer, he had greatly enhanced the strength of his position and the wealth of his coffers by marrying into the powerful family of the Nevils, of whose influence the reader may form some idea when we, remind him that Earl Warwick, the "King-maker," was the head of that house, at whose table, it is said, thirty thousand retainers were daily fed in different parts of the kingdom, there being scarcely a county which boasted not some stronghold, over whose ramparts flaunted the arms of the powerful earl. Numerous were the couriers that arrived from England, bearing despatches to the leader of the invading army; and many were the conferences that privately took place between the Duke and his protege, whose marked favor with his lord had already raised against him a host of powerful enemies, who *looked upon him as a base-born kerne, and unworthy the confidence which the Duke, a better judge of man's nature, had accorded him. The following is the substance of the most important of those despatches, the frequency of whose arrival marked the existence of something of more worthy note than matters relating merely to the Duke's command. Suffolk having been impeached by the Parliament, was found guilty of treason; and was, on his own confession, banished by his sovereign for five years, being ordered to quit the kingdom and take up his abode in France. This leniency on the part of the King did not suit the Commons, who had   THE BONDSMAN'S STRUGGLE.          25 resolved to sacrifice Suffolk as a peace-offering on the altar of his country's wrongs, and who therefore took measures to intercept him on his journey; and the unfortunate Duke was seized near Dover, his head struck off, and his body remorselessly consigned to feed the monsters of\ the deep, who per- chance paid but scant deferenc, to the ennobled blood which circled in the veins of their welcome prey. Here was indeed stirring news for the aspiring Dukl . The leader of the opposing faction thus suddenly cut off, it needed but little else than the presence of himself, aided and supported by the powerful nobles whom re- lationship or interest united to his cause, to achieve the great object for which he had lived, and schemed, and plotted. To be sure there were powerful interests arrayed against him. The base and false-liearted church- man, Cardinal Beaufort, had great sway in the English counsels, and his voice was ever clamorous against the Yorkist party; which was owing in great measure to the fact of the Duke on one occasion spurning indignantly from his presence a certain Lord Henry Willoughby, who, though acknow- ledged an the nephew of the proud and vicious Primate, was well known in certain circles to claim a nearer affinity, despite the vow of celibacy of the perjured Cardinal. This was an indignity neither Lord Henry nor his relative dared openly resent, but it was food for dark ruminations of future vengeance. As we have said before, it was essential to the success of the Yorkist party that their leader should be on the spot to avail himselfnf--tl e great advantages arising from the death of Suffolk. At the juncture of these occurrences, it unfortunately happened that the operations of the army were of such a nature that Richard could not leave his post witlout laying himself open to grave charges of mal-administration of the trust reposed in him by King Henry, and thus giving an advantage to the opposite faction. The best he could do, therefore, was to despatch a confidential messenger, charged with full instructions to the various leaders, and. appointing various times and places for the contenqplated rising, so that there should be a concentration of forces and a concert of action, all tending to the one point, and all terminating in the one grand result-the elevation oa Richard of York to the tnrone of England. The politic Duke had long foreseen the probability of such an emcegency as the present, and had labored hard to so fashion the young Cade as to render him fit to meet tihe want which had at length arisen. It was necessary that the young man should fully understand all the ulte- rior views of him whose agent he was to be, and that he should possess tact, both in the concealnent of his knowledge, and caution in its avowal in thq proper quarter. As it was highly dangerous to commit any of the details of these plans to paper, for fear of capture or loss, everything was to be firmly stamped on the memory of the emissary before lie left Ireland, which his lord had resolved he should do as soon ,as the necessary steps for his departure could' b taken. There was mlso in the camp, and attached to the Duke's household, a pious and enthusiastic old man named Friar Lacy, a great favorite with his lord,    26           .JACK CADiE; Ol, and an especial friend of th-e young Cade. Many a lonely hour did the young soldier while away over the glimmering watch-fire, listening to the counsels of his aged friend, the burden of whose exhortations was ever the 9 one theme,-Liberty! Liberty of speech, liberty of action, liberty of religion. It is not to be supposed that the youthful Cade could listen day after days and night after night to the glowing language of the seemingly inspired Lacy, without imbibing much of the enthusiasm that warmed the breast of his aged Mentor, or without nurturing in his own soul the germ of that divine essence which is exhaled from the very contemplation of the heaven- born goddess of Freedom. No, this was impossible; and, ever hopeful of the mighty results which would hereafter arise from his cherished teachings, the good old man was pireparing a champion in the cause of Liberty, whose arm should one day shake the feudal fabric to its very centre, and cause the proud Barons of England to quake within the blood-cemented walls of their well-nigh im- pregnable castles. Knowing the attachment of the worthy Friar to the young soldier, and right glad to have him act as a sort of wholesome restraint upon the some- what impetuous nature of Cade, the Duke readily acquiesced in their joint - prayer that Lacy might accompany him on his mission to England, especially as they were to pass through Kent, where lived the young man's family, and ' where the good father, an especial favorite of the elder Cade and the Dame Bertha, whose marriage he had solemnized, might sojourn, while the youth hasted forward, with a rapidity illy calculated to be borne by one of Lacy's years, to perform the urgent behests of his lord and friend. On the evening previous to the day fixed for their departure, a long and earnest conversation had been held between the Duke and Cade, in the course of which the latter had been made fully acquainted with the plan of the contemplated rising, which was to be in the name of the all popular Mortimer; a watchword which it was well known would act as a talisman on the lower orders of England, touching a chord in the hearts of the Commons which would cause the whole kingdom to vibrate to its very extremities.  It is a strange coincidence but historically true, that while detailing to his ambassador the watchword of the party, the Duke was led to speak in termn of great wonderment of the strong resemblance there was between Cade and the very Sir John Mortimer he named. This remark, though unnoticed at the time, recurred to the mind of Cade in after years, and made him assume a character, the popular belief in the authenticity of which was a circumstance to which he owed much of the popularity which attended his heroic struggle. Having at length received all the information and instruction necessary for the successful issue of the enterprise upon which he was to embark, the young man, with a buoyancy of spirit which ever characterizes the early ^   movements of sanguine and ambitious minds, at a late hour of the night took an affectionate leave of his general, who, since the day on which the brave youth had so heroically exposed his own life in defending that of the   THE BONDSMAN'S STRUGGLE.         2 Duke, had treated him more as a companion and confidant than the high- born nobles by whom he was surrounded could well brook the knowledge of. Lacy,- shortly after the leave-taking of Cade, was summoned to the Duke's tent, and there also partially entrusted with the nature of the mission upon which his companion was about th depart, and was strongly urged by Richard to keep all due check upon the words and actions of his friend lest by any mat-adroitness he might not only compromise his own safety but also the safety of some of England's proudest peers, and most noble families. Now, Friar Lacy, had lived long, had seen much of the world, and was a firm friend of liberty and the unflinching advocate of the down-trodden masses of England's unhappy serfs. This interview with Richard, therefore, seemed to the good Friar, to open up a long vista of events through the dim haze of which the achievement of a mighty purpose appeared'to be evolved. A purpose which to be successful -, 'needed but one gigantic mind to grasp with comprehensive sweep the great results to be attained; backed by a soul to dare the perils of the task, which a brave and powerful arm would not shrink to encounter. To find this hero, and fit him for the high destiny of liberating a nation was the Friar's stern resolve, and with this purpose ever before him, hi lessons to the young and enthusiastic Cade breathed a more distinct and pointed moral than hitherto had been their wont. CHAPTER VI. IT was a splendid morn in early spring that two travellers might have been seen wending their way through some of the loveliest paths that ever fragrant blossoms or sweet-voiced songsters had vouchsafed to beautify and gladden. The one strode briskly forward, with the quick and buoyant step of youth, pausing now and then to call the attention of his more aged and less ener- getic companion to some peculiar beauty of the landscape which lay stretched out before them, and demanding whether a spot could ere be found to match the springtime glory of those "Fertile felds and valleys green," which were now bathed with the beautiful tints of the rising sun. "Good Lacy " said the young Cade, for the two travellers were no other than our old friends, who had just landed on England's shores, "and is this fair soil the oppressed country which you would fain make me believe it is? Methinks thine earnest prayers for its redemption, though breathed in our sister isle of Erin, must have proved most miraculously efficacious." "Ah! boy, thine eye but skims the surface of the sea, beneath whose placid waves lie sunk many a fair bark, which launched upon its treacherous bosom has sadly proved the sterner wisdom of my keener sight. See you not yonder proud castle, with its lofty battlements, looking down     28           JACK CADE; OR, in pride and scorn upon the lowly huts which dot the landscape's broad expanse? Mark well my words, my son, while I declare to thee, that said castle's walls soar not more high above those humble cots, than does its haughty lord above the serfs, whose life and liberties are but the playthings of his tyrant will." "Hold, hold, good Lacy, how know you that he who owns the towers of which you speak, boasts not a heart as good, a hand as free, a power as just as ere claimed service of our willing kernes in Erin's once happy isle?" "Nay, lad, thou hast but illy read the heart I have so oft laid bare to thee, an thou hast yet to learn that Lacy never injured man by thought or deed. Had I not known well the guilty noble of whom I speak, I had been less apt to prate his faults to ears I fain would charm wthl words of bolder theme.' Pardon me, my best of friends, that thus by inconsiderate speech I seemed to doubt the justness of thy censures of one I little reck'd thou knewest so well. Pray tell me whence this knowledge, and what angry memories light up thine eyes with fires I deemed the sacred lustre which shone alone when Freedom was thy mighty theme?" "The story of my wrongs is not of mine alone, but that of many whose craven souls had they possessed one tithe of manhood's noblest gift, would long ere this have nerved their stalwart arms to pluck the bold oppressor from the path his crimes have mnarked with such undying stains. Alas for me, what could my unaided arna achieve against this haughty lord, pano- plied with all the rights that doth begirt these tyrant wolves, whose chosen prey is man, their growl the signal of his speedy wrongs?" "Good father, methinks'it must be thoughts of some deep grief that thus can stir thy kindly nature into words and looks beseeming better the artned knight on tented field than holy friar with cowl and cossack. I fain would know the wrong can thus move mny gentle friend to mood that breathes of sterner thoughts than aves and paters. Perchance, if such is still thy aim, my feeble arm-in such a cause how willing-could work for thee some sure and speedy vengeance;" "Vengeance; aye, that's the potent word can call me back to time long syne, ere yet this hated garb and shaven crown had made me less than man,.. or seeming man, possessing less than manhood's meanest gift. Know, my  son, for full these fifteen years I've lived for one bright thought-one mighty aim-one stern resolve which now hath nerved my soul to such a deed shall make our names resound in joint acclaim swelled by the chorus of a nation's mighty and unfettered voice. Yes! I say ourl names, my friend, because I am well assured that when the time comes you will not fail me. Since first I saw thee nestling in thy mother's bosom, and knew, as well I did, the stock from whence you sprung, I marked thee for the instru- ment fit to accomplish the one great purpose of my soul. For this end have I endeavored to instill into your mind those glowing pictures of Liberty without which we are but stocks and stones, knowing no other law than that which bids us hug the chains which bind us to the chariot wheels of so;:e   ei i!THE BONDSMAN'8 STRUGGLE.                  29 proud despot, whose accident of birth has given to him " the lands, the woods and streams, and all that dwell thereon and in," for so readthe title- deeds of those whose thralls we are. Well, as I before remarked, I fixed upon you as one likely to achieve a great purpose, and to this end have all my lessons, counsels, and conversations tended. The time has not yet arrived for the consummation of the plan, but in the meanwhile it will serve to nerve thy arm in the right cause, to dwell in this truly oppressed land, and with thine own eyes behold some of the injustice I oft have spoken of." "Father, right glad am I to hear thee say thou hast a purpose to perform wherein my arm may be of service; and believe me, never will Jack Cade prove rereant to the teachings thou hast so kindly given. As to the nature of the deed of which thou speaklest so warmly, and of the accomplishment of which thou art so sanguine, I seek not to learn until thou choosest to disclose it, when, be it what it may, you may count on Iat least one willing arm, one faithful heart. " "Friend Cade, 1 thank thee for thy promise, and if I mistuke not, it will not be long ere there will be stirring work in this our good county of Kent, which can boast the largest count of sturdy axemen and stalwart hackbuttiers "f ere a shrievalty in the realm. And now, as thy father's cottage lies yet ,full many a mile before us, I will tell you briefy the reason of my hate of this Lord Sa4, whose Castle but now I pointed out, and you shall then judge if I have not cause to cry for vengeance." The Friar Lacy here commenced the story of his younger days, which, though sufficiently interesting to beguile the way of a portion of its tedious- ness, is not necessary to our history, and we Shall therefore use a writer's privilege, and explain only so much to the reader as will suffice to a correct understanding of the story.    - Some twenty years anterior to the period in which this chapter opens, Lacy, farmer Lacy he was then called, had lived on the estate of Lord Say, then but a stripling in years, but old in vice, cultivating a small farm which he held under a feudal tenure, compelling to certain service and duties to the lord of the soil, but as these were not then onerous, his lot was a happy and, contented one. He was the husband of anl affectionate and thrifty wife, and the fond father of a blooming and thuxon daughter. Leal, for such was her nramoe, was in sooth a lovely girl, and the fame of her beauty had spread far and wide in the county, until it reached the ears of one who little scrupled to gratify lhis passions, let the object of them be what it might. Was it to be supposed then tlat ithe lesuit Beiaufort, the unscrupulous and wily emissary of the Papal See, would hesitate when only a peasant girl's ruin was put in the scale against the gratification of his pleasures? Of course not. This then being settled, it now only remained to get the girl into his clutches, which could be achieved only thlrough the c(innivanee and assist- ance of Lord Say, at whose castle the base churchman, afterwards Bishop of Winchester, was then on a visit, together with a few other unruly and turbulent lords whose riotous conduct had made London too hot to hold i        30            JACK CADE; OR, them; for be it known, the citizens were not the peaceful worms the rois- tering nobles would gladly have had them be. Far from it, they had of late presumed to lop off without much ceremony, the polluting arm of some swaggering lord, who dared to assail the waist of a burgher's daughter. Nor ventured the weak king to punish the bold citizen for thlls avenging the insult, conscious as he was that but smath provocation was needed to raise such -a storm about his ears as would wreck the little authority he yet wielded. To return from this digression. We left the Jesuit Beaulr -;t revolving in his mind how best he might obtain possession of the lovely Leah, and as no way seemed so feasible as to inveigle her by some pretence or other to the Castle, he straight proceeded to his arch friend and counsellor, Say, and urged himl to hit upon some plan to gratify the passion which consumed him, and which could only be assuaged by the ruin of the unoffending girl, whose betrayal these bad men so remorselessly contemplated. It will he recollected that Lacy's land was held in fee from Say, who, ther f^ Jiad the right to certain service from the farmer; and it now str c I   aim that he might obtain possession of the daughter under plea of needing hei assistance to wait upon some ladies at the Castle. So far as getting Leah within the walls this plan availed them, but beyond that, these wicked men had no success to boast, and failed to make any progress in the ulterior designs they had in view. It was in vain the wicked Beaufort armed himself with all the peculiar powers delegated to him, as an emissary, of what we now term, the Propa- ganda. The modest Leah spurned alike the base proposals and him who made them e Not only this, but she would on the instant have fled to her father, and from him sought protection against the vile seducer, but, alas! her every step was watched, and every avenue of escape securely guarded by the creatures of the Lord Say. Finding entreaties, threats, and the terrors of superstition alike unavailing against the pure teachings of her honest parents, the half maddened profli- gate had recourse to treachery, and while laboring under the effects of a stupifying drug, the unfortunate girl became the unconscious victim of an outrage, as base in its conception as it was dastardly in its consummation. When first restored to consciousness and made aware of her dishonor, the thing seemed too horrible to realize, and in vain her betrayer tried with false and honeyed tones to calm the tempest that well nigh destroyed her . reason. Finding, after many days, that neither promises of present riches nor hopes of future grandeur seemed to dgden the violence of her griet or to stop the reproaches of her upbraiding tongue, she was dismissed back to her father the mere wreck of that fair form which but a few weeks pre- vious had left his sheltering arms. At first, Leah, resolved to confide the story of her'wrongs to his ear, and. urge him to avenge the great outrage she had suffered; but when she looked on her parents' happy and smiling faces, as each morn they welcomed her with the parental kiss, she could not muster courage to tell the tale that must for ever blast their earthly joys. No, it could not be; she would suf-   TllE BONDSMAN'S STRUGGLE.          31 for in' secret and conring the knowledge of her wrongs within that bosom, whici ere long began to throb with pulsations other than those an unwed maiden may safely feel. It was now that the wretched Leah regretted she had not confessed to her father the story of her undoing, but even with t th thought, her. heaving breast smotkher for thus seeldin vengeance on the father of her unborn :4t   babe. She now, therefore, resolved to see the betrayer of her honor, and demand from him that shelter and support, which she dared not stay to seek within the home of those kind parents, whose love she had so unworthily returned, in thus withholding that confidence which is the strong link that binds us in the happy bonds of domestic love. Learning that her seducer was even then on a visit to the Castle, she resolved to leave her home, while yet she could conceal her misfortune, and trust to some happy chance to prevent the knowledge of what she well knew would break her parents' hearts. Making, therefore, an excuse for a sojourn of a few weeks with tie of her village companions who were engaged at the Castle, she boldly set, 6Oa thither and requested an audience of the Jesuit. . This was joyfully granted, as half the motive of his present visit had been a revival of his passion for his unfortunate victim, and no sooner did-he again behold her than he used the utmost sophistry of which his tongue could boast to still the upbraid- ings wherewith the wretched girl loaded the author of her shame. Suflice it to say he failed to convince her reason, but succeeded in overcoming her anger, a result which was owing more to Nature's pleadings than his own. It was finally agreed that Say should despatch a messenger to Lacy, say- ing that his daughter was to attend some visitors on a journey to London, whither the poor girl was privately conveyed, and secreted in one of Beau- fort's numerous residences, where she ere long became the mother of him whom we have briefly alluded to as Sir Henry Willoughby, a youth who was generally thought to bear no closer affinity to the Cardinal than that of nephew. Now, it was not in the nature of things possible that this dreadful mis- fortune could long fail of reaching the farmer's ears, neither was it. There wanted not envious tongues who were but too willing to bruit abroad the story of their rival's dishonor; and who scrupled not to say that it was of her own seeking, sneeringly adding that the honest lads of the village were beneath the notice of the haughty -beauty, who forsooth, must mate with lords and nobles, were it even as their "light-o-love.?' Who shall tell the mad fury that kindled in the father's gleaming eyes when first he heard his daughter's name coupled with foul dishonor. It was false; yes, false and lying were the vile words of those who dared wag their tongues against his daughter's fame. But now is no time for words, Quick would he disprove the base slander. Rushing, bare headed, through all opposing obstacles, the fierce Lacy sped - onward to the Castle, and pealed so loud a claim for open gates as woke 1u     32            JACK CADE; OR, every echo of its most hidden labyrinth. Obtaining entrance, the angry man sought speedy audience of its lord, and from him demanded the truth or falsehood of the tale of which his maddened brain now scarce could real- ize the horrid outline. With many a sneer and bitter scoff did this vile lord mock at the father's agony, proclaiming with fiendish mirth the base betrayal of his daughter's honor; nor stopped he there, but, as if in seeming mockery of Nature's ties, forged the base slander which made the girl a willing party to her own undoing. At this most odious lie the father's vengeance could no longer brook con- trol, and bounding forward, the maddened yeoman struck, the base slan- derer to the earth. Quick rushed the minions of this craven lord upon the unarmed man, and held him pinioned firm till their master's will should speak befitting chas- tisement for so bold an outrage. Ere long the hoarse command was given to lash with sturdy arms the au- dacious miscreant from the castle walls, burn 4own his barns, commit his dwelling to the flames, and drive forth himself and wife as wanderers, to seek among the denizens of the forests that shelter which more ferocious man denied them. After many dangers nrd much suffering, the miserable father reached Ireland alone, having buried his beloved wife with his own hands within a cave, which for some days waa their only shelter from the morning's cold blast and the night's chilly dews. The fond mother died of a broken heart, and with her latest breath cursed the man who had wrought so much misery. Lacy, disgusted with the world and all its hollow falsehoods, had, on reach- ing Ireland, joined a brotherhood of monks, and quickly gained a name for sanctity, as the most austere and self-mortifying of all those who hoped to win heaven by crucifying the flesh. Here it was those dreams of vengeance had been conceived, and that gigantic plan of liberty elaborated, which now formed the one absorbing idea of his existence. Every movement on the grand battle-field of Europe had been keenly watched and sagaciously con- sidered; and it was in obedience to the promptings of his far-seeing mind that we now find him, after an absence of some twenty years, aghin looking on those proud towers, which to him could speak no other language than that of tyranny, oppression, and vnogeance. The Friar's tale having brought them nearly to their journey's end, the happy youth bounded eagerly forward to meet a father's grasp, a mothers kiss, perchance a sister's tear. Having gained the cottage, he knocked loudly for admittance, but what dark forebodings, what gloomyfears rush through his brain as his eager ear listens in vain for the approaching steps to open the door, the closing of which struck him as perhaps an English custom, speaking intelligibly enough of less security than that which marked the open cottages in his once happy Irish home. Grown impatient of longer delay, he repeated the summons for admittance with an energy that now quickly brought his mother to the door.   THE' BONDSIMAA' STRUGGLE.          3 At the sight of her son, whom the honest Bertha recognized with all a mother's quick perception, she uttered a scream of joy, and rushed wildly into his outstretched arms. For many moments she lay and sobbed on his bosom, nor heeded his com- panion, who stood by in mute surprise, endeavoring to unravel the mystery which he felt was somehow or other connected with this passionate display of feeling. ,1Xd   Ere long the good dame became sufficiently composed to listen to the questions of her son respecting the health and whereabouts of his father and sister. His mother, instead of answering, looked suddenly and cautiously up, as if to scrutinize her son's companion ere she ventured a reply to his seemingly simple question. On recognizing the worthy Friar, the friend of her youth and the counsellor of her maiden years, tears of gladness again streamed down her aged face as she exclaimed, ' God has not yet forsaken me, nor left me to bear alone the heavy burden His wisdom has seen fit to lay upon "me 1" Cade and his friend Lacy looked inquiringly at each other, wondering what could be the meaning of these alternate bursts of gladness and parox- ysms of grief, but determined to await an explanation, although on the rack of suspense, until the good dame became more collected. Starting suddenly up, the fond mother busied herself in preparing some refreshment for her son and Lacy, who both bore unmistakable tokens of fatigue and hunger; and when pressed to postpone her labors until she had eased their minds of the disquietude they felt in regard to both father and daughter, she promised that she would relate whatever she had to tell, while they partook of the meal she was hastening to prepare, intimating the proba- bility there was that they might need some refreshment to enable them to bear any further fatigue they might be called upon to encounter. The fact was, Dame Bertha had not sufficiently nerved herself to the task of informing her son Jack of the melancholy situation of his father, or of unfolding to him the almost hopeless expedition on which his sister had departed. The meal being prepared, the impatience of young Oade could no longer be curbed, and he eagerly pressed his mother to relate the news of which 'she seemed so chary. Thus entreated, Dame Oade informed her son of all the dreadful cirpum- stances which had terminated so disastrously to his father, and sought his advice and that of her old friend, the Friar, as to what course it' was best to pursue. The latter seemed painfully agitated during the recital, and well might he be, for too surely did he foresee the termination of this most unfortunate affair. Knowing, as he had bitter cause to do, the villainy of Say, the petty tyranny of his minion Courtnay, and the vile passions of those who were the usual guests at the castle, he trembled alike for the honor of Grace and the life of her father, whom lie shrewdly guessed was but the victim of a vile scheme for the betrayal of his child. The Friar's quiet but thoughtful mien was strangely contrasted by the     34             JACK CADE; storm of rage and angry denunciation which burst from the heaving bosom of the youth, who vowed most deep and bitter vengeance against any he in Christendom who dared lay hand upon his noble sire, or pollute the ears of his sister wT one single ribald word. Alas! poor youth, he little knew the remorseless men with whom he had to deal. Men who, proud in the accident of birth, which had made them noble and him base, would laugh to scorn his threats of vengeance, and hurl defiance at his claims for justice. Starting suddenly up, the impetuous youth announced his determination to hie instantly to the castle, and bearding the tyrant in his own halls, demand the liberation of his father and the restoration of his sister. In vain the more prudent Lacy urged him to tarry until sufficient time had elapsed to enable Grace to try the success of her own effort in their father's cause; intimating the while, that he would but mar all chance of mercy by- thus rousing the angcr of a man who was but too ready to pour out the vials of his wrath on all who crossed his purpose. But Cade would list no reason, and hastily girding on that sword which had served him in good stead in many a well-fought field, hastily kissed his unhappy mother, and craving a blessing of the good Lacy, who in vain sought to restrain his angry passion, rushed madly out to dare he knew not what. CHAPTER VII. IT will be recollected by the reader that we left the fair and heroic Grace waiting with her two companions, Straw and Worthy, the return of the unwilling messenger, whom the latter, by some peculiar means to them un- known, had induced to signify their presence and the nature of their errand to his lord. We have seen how the indignant Say chafed at the boldness of the demand -a demand which spoke of justice-and to what final conclusion he arrived in regard to the answer he should send to the applicant. But there is one fact to which we would call attention; and that is, the presence at Say's banqueting-board of the) young Lord Harry Willoughby, who had long sought to behold the paragon of beauty the yeoman's daughter was said tobe. When the proposition was made to have the poor girl summoned before  them, it is not strange that this lordship's voice was strenuous in the advo- cacy of it, as it would afford him the wished-for opportunity, unattended by the risk of a buffet from the brawny arm of the farmer, which had been sternly threatened, should he catch his lordship prowling around his cottage. One would have thought that the presence of the Cardinal-his father-- would have proved some check upon the young man, but such was npt the case; the son knew too well the crimes of his parent, and the base outrage to which he himself owed his being, to stand in much awe of one whose ex-   THE nONDSMAN'S STRUG(GE.         35 ample was ever of the most pernicious tendency, ;nd whose teachings were ever at variance with his practice. The still trembling retainer, rejoicing to be freed from his master's presence, sped quickly to the warder's room, where he had left Grace, and there de- livered the message with which he was charged. Grace instantly prepared to attend him to the presence of his lord, and intimated to her two friends her desire that they should accompany her, which they proposed to do. On arriving at the outer entrance of the room, wherein Say and his guests were assembled, their conductor informed the maiden that she alone was to enter, and that her companions must tarry without. That such were his orders, on peril of his head. Oh, how the heart of this poor girl sunk within her as she too truly read the nature of the ordeal to which she was to be exposed. Already were her ears assailed: by the rude sounds of boisterous mirth, which awakened the dull cchoc of the lofty passage in which she was taking brief leave of her friends,-' who strove their best to cheer her droop- ing spirits with words of hope, Which much they feared would prove un- founded.  A   At length recovering herself with suddein energy, Grace signified her readiness to enter, and the usher throwing wide the massy doors, this noble girl found herself face to face with him in whose hands lay the destiny of that father whom she so dearly loved, and whose present peril had been brought about by the defence of her own honor. Lucy was it that this thought occurred to her, for it nerved her resolu- tion with that defiant bearing which did her better service with tos hoshose admiring eyes were fixed upon her crimsoncd cheeks, than would have done the downcast look and lowered tone of those who feared those glances which seldom lingered but to betray. Notwithstanding the deep embarrassment of her position, Grace walked forward until she had approached within a few yards of the elevated dais upon which Lord Say was seated, when, folding her arms modestly upon her bosom, she awaited the sound of that voice upon whose decree hung life or death. Say having contemplated her for a while with undisguised admiration, turned him towards the Lord Cardinal, and, with a sneer, said: "Behold, my lords and gentlemen, the beauteous and blushing advocate who seeks our halls to tempt our well known clemency from that stern pur- pose which should steel our hearts in justice"'cause. What say ye, shall we listen to the syren tones which well I wot those ruby lips will utter wherec - with to charm our ears, that Courtnay's most just cries for vengeance be not heeded?" Several of the company, among whom. Lord Willoughby was foremost, strongly urged upon Say the propriety of hearing what the maiden had to tell; for from the nature of her message, which their entertainer had been too ruffled properly to heed, they had inferred that instead of a petitioner she appeared before them as an accuser.            \     36            JACK CADE ; OR, Thus encouraged, and being bid to speak, Grace raised her brilliant eyes, and slowly letting them dwell for a moment upon each individual (as if to gather assurance from the scrutiny) of that assembled company, finally letting them settle upon him whose sneers bespoke but feeble hope of find- ing there an upright judge. With the connectedness of truth and the minuteness of reality, did this resolute girl narrate the full particulars of the base attack made upon her  by the miscreant Steward, and her escape from his dastardly outrage by the means of that dagger which had been the cause of bringing her father into those bonds from which she pleaded that he might be released. While her ear was yet earnestly bent to catch the first note of response to her lappeal, and her eyes were turned imploringly upon the countenance of Sir Willoughby, who had won he' grateful thanks by the few words he had previously spoken in her behalf there arose without such wild shouts' of uproar and fierce clang of weapons, that each nobleman sprang to his feet, and rushing impetuously to the door, for the moment forgot the presence of Grace and the purpose of her errand. One only of the party remained, and he, approaching the terrified maiden, bid her quiet her fears, and trust to him for protection; that the noise was probably the rcsult of some drunken brawl of his friend's retainers, and that when peace was restored, he would endeavor so to urge her appeal with Lord Say, that 'liot only should her father be liberated, but Oourtnay should be punished. What boundless gratitude beamed in the eyes of the half assured Grace, as she looked up in the fhce of iLord Willoughby, and beholding there a calm stIile, foolishy believed he meant her flir. But he, the bise profligate, who cotld "Smile and smile, and be  v'illain,"  had marked her for his prey, and krnowing from hler oxwn lips the heroism with which she had resisted Courtnay, conceived the better policy of enlist-' ing her gratitude in 'his behalf,-a feeling whicth has, alas, proved the ruin of thousands. he was pretty well convinced that the elder Cade would be, sacrificed to Say's anger and the Steward's vengeance, so he had little fear of resistance. as he conceived tlhat Grace would be completely defenCeless, and tlhus entirely exposed 1o his machinations. Consistently with the pla, lie lhad bfrmed, Willoughby begged her, the din growing louder and louder, to let him escort her to some place of safety; while hIe light hlasteI to lend his arm1 in aid of Say, whose rallying cry-now sounded hoarsely athove the clash of arms 'and the shouts of confused voic't'. ('race thalnked him hleartily fr ;he ofiler, but begged him rather to show her some outlet by which sheo might gain the foi'rest path that led through the Holi e Grove to her father's cottage. This Lord Harry- promised to do, and while conducting her to a small postern in the rear of the Castle, of which he fortunately possessed the key,   :gV lTlE BON DSMAN S ST1RUGGOLX. -  li!!lfi llh    Oade'a fierce encounter with Lord Say, made earnest profession of the influence he would use to liberate her father; for which kind assrance, he took toll from the unresisting lips of the fair girl, who mastered her feelings of outraged delicacy, for fear of rousing an enemy where she so-anxiously wished a friend. The young lord, having seen Grace depart on her homeward path, hastened to the spot where the sounds of tumult were loudest, and there . found Say at the head of those of his retainers who dwelt within the Oastleo walls, ^   ai assisted by his noble guests, engaged in a fierce and bloody strug-  gle -with some fifty or sixty of the bondsmen of the neighborhood, led on y' a young man of noble bearing, who was to be seen rushing into the very  thickest of the mpl6e, and with gleaming blade driving all before him. On the side of this brave youth were ranged both Straw and Worthy, together With two of Say's most esteemed vrasals, men who had long held posts of trust around the Oastle walls. These latter were named Gtrald and Wal* rter, the former of whom was the ma with whom Worthy had held thO 3-     38            JcACKE CADE; OR, whispered conference which we have seen induced him to carry Grace's message to hismaster. The explanation of this mystery is simple, and may as well be made here as elsewhere. When Gerald was an orphan youth, and but newly entered the service of Say, it had been part of his duty to attend to the falconry wherein were confined those birds which by his lord were held in best esteem. Now it so happened that in cleaning the mews, a tassel gentle of rare value escaped from its confinement and fled far beyond recal. The poor lad, in wildest despair, for he knew his passionate lord would mercilessly punish him, fled from the Castle, and sought refuge with master Worthy, whose protecting arm had ere then succored many a sore-pressed thrall. Here the lad lay con-. cealed until an-opportunity offered to leave the country, which he did in a Dutch lugger that occasionally avslted the coast, and on board which he remained till not only his offence was forgotten, but till time and exposure had so changed his appearance that none could recognize in the bronzed features of the broad-shouldered sailor, thedelicate youth who had fled from punishment for the loss of a miserable sparrow-hawk.  When Gerald (suoh was the name he assumed) returned to his native place, hefound that his brother Walter, the only friend he had, iwav n the service of his former master, and for the sake of being near him he too sought service, and was accepted, for it was wise policy on the part of the tyrant lord to select his more immediate attendants from among those who were less thoroughly acquainted with the baseness of his character. Gerald yearned to make himself known td his former protector, who he deemed ignorant of his return, but he dreaded that any apparent intimacy between him and Worthy might not only create1 distrust on the part of Say, but compromise his friend; who was already sufficiently obnoxious to both Courtnay and his master. It was with astonishment, therefore, that on the occasion previously described, Gerald found his disguise had been penetrated, and that he was now in a position to oblige his friend by conveying the haughty message of Graoe to his master. But this was not the only service he was that day to perform, thus proving the truthfulness of the moral of the fabled lion and monse. CHAPTER TIn. IT is here necessary that we retrograde a little to account for the conflict 'which was now raging within the walls of the Castle. It will be recollected that when Grace sought the presence of Say, her companions Worthy and Straw had been compelled to tarry without, which they did most reluctantly, for they doubted the policy of so much beauty being thrown unprotected into the presence of men whose passions knew no bounds save those of their wills and whose irresponsibe linse owned no cheek to its gratification.    'lIE BON'DSMAN'S 8TiRUGI,:. -      39 Worthy, who was himself the fathcr of a flaxen-haired girl, his darling Kate, not only pitied the embarrassment of Grace, but felt anxious for her ultimate safety, and resolved to take certain steps to prevent any wrong which these false lords might meditate against her. Taking prompt counsel with Straw, the two resolved to depart immedi- ately, jnd collect a few able and ready, hands to meet any emergency that might arise.. dalling Gerald towards them, whose turn it fortunately was to keep watch and ward upon the walls, Worthy explained to him briefly the dotermina- tion h had come to, and begged him if he ever felt one spark of gratitude towards him to show it now, by afHbrding him, and the men whom lie would speedily bring, an entrance within the Castle. Gerald could not resist the entreaty, but told him that within the hour, he .would find the sally-port which opened into the forrest not only unguarded but unsecured, and that if he and his party entered noiselessly  they'might, by the under-ground passage, gain the inner walls ere a suspicion of danger was around, particularly as his brother Walter had charge of the only gun which commanded the entrance, and he (Gerald) would answer not only for no opposition Prom him, but that both himself and brother would aid in the attack, for they would then be too deeply compromised to think of remaining unsuspected. oh Worthy grasped heartily the hand of the young man, and quickly departed to raise a force to defend Grace from any contemplated Wrong. Having despatched Straw in another direction, 'he himself hastened toward his own home to arm his farm servants in so just a cause. On arriving at his cottage, Worthy briefly told his family of the peril of Grace, and hurried with some fifteen or twenty brave lhearts to the rendzvous appointed for the meeting of himself and Straw, with whatove -aid the latter might have secured.                ( ft was while hastening rapidly forward that the stout yeoman was astounded by seeing a man emerge suddenly from one of the forrest paths, who, boldly confronting him and his party, demanded who he was and whither he was going, and Whether he had sufficient courage to aid a son in the liberation of his fatherlfrom a tyrant's grasp, and assist in the rescue of a sister from a fate worse than that of death. To these demands, put in a most excited and incoherent manner, Worthy could only reply by demanding the name of him who with unsheathed sword and haughty words thus barred the passage of an English yeoman. With almost a yell the reply came hissing from the throat of the excited stranger. "Ask ye who I am? Know, that I am Cade!--JACK CAnE, the ordained instrument to pluck yon proud oppressor from his lofty seat and hurl him headlong into that yawning gulf, where black despair shall gnaw his guilty soul with never-ending torments. If ye are men-on,-on to Castlo. Say, , and let our watchword be, / "Death to our tyrant lords; England's serfs are free t" *f.  '         ,          . '            *     40           -j9 ACK CD ; Q            Yn,- Worthy having hur.#edjl4xplained that he and his party were even then proceeding thither, the ycng Cade put himself .at their head, and with rapid strides advanced to the spot indicated by the yeoman as that where Straw and the other bondsmen were to assemble. The two parties having rnited, Wothy guided them through the forrest till they reached the sally-port mentioned by Gerald as that by which they were to enter. True to his-promise, the door yielded to their tougih, and the whole party, numbering some sixty men, variously armed, crept stealthily forward till they gained the gate connecting the outer and inner defences. fere they were joined by Gerald and Walter, who guided theu safely and unseen till they stood in the very centre of Say's impregnable fortress. Jack now eagerly demanded from Gerald where his father was confined, that he might hasten to his deliverance, and it was while engaged in a struggle with his jailer for possession of the key, that the discharge of a matchlock gave the first intimation to Say of the danger with whichlhe was threatened. With all his vices there was one quality which Say possessed in an eminent degree, that was, courage. Not that moAl bravery which will induce a man boldly to meet an enemy in fair and honest fight, and manfully do battle in defence of a just cause; but rather, that bull dog ferocity which being forced into a conflict, engages in itwith a tenacity and fiereceess which knows'none of those graces with which a truly brave man a-ulpers victory. Quickly unsheathing his sword, which in those days scarcely ever left the thigh of those who were permitted to wear one, Say rushed into the m6l6e, and dealt fierce blows around him; but he fought under one great disadvan- tage; he neither knew the point from whence his castle was assailed, nor the nature nor number of the assailants. It was not until he found' himself 'opposed to his hitherto trusty hench- man, Gerald, that he deemed there was ought of treachery on the part of his own people; but when this conviction was forced upon him, and the rallying, cry of, "a Cade a Cade to the rescue!" burst upon his ears, then he began to realize the peril in which he was placed, and became sensible that some desperate means must be adopted to meet the emergency of the aseo. A sudden thought now flashed upon him; he resolved to paralyze the arm of the son, through fear of consequences to the father. Quickly disappearing from the more immediate scene of the conflict, Say rushed breathlessly to that portion of the fortress in which was situated the dungeon wherein was confined his victim, and where he fouud the jailer still faithful to his trust. . Commanding him instantly to manacle his prisoner, and place a stout halter round his neck, he bade him conduct him by a secret stairway to the top of one of the turrets, and there await such signal as might be given him. Having accomplished this dastardly manceuvre, he hastened back to the sountyard, where he found the posture of affairs much worse than when he left. His cousin Lord Clifford, badly wounded, was engaged in a hand-to-   THE BONDSMAN'S s'RUGCO.    ;      41 hand conflict with the invincible young leader, Cade, who seemed to be ubiquitous, his fierce cry and trenchant blade being hered and seen wherever blows fell fastest. Straw and Worthy, wielding powerful Jethart axes, a weapon but newly introduced, were mrking sad havoc with the heads of their oponents, many of whom lay bleeding and senseless beneath the feet of the combattants. Hoping by some successful blow to disable the springall who had conjured up this storm about his ears, Say rushed desperately to the spot where the well-nigh fainting Clifford maintained an unequal contest with his yet unharmed opponefit. Signalling to one of his retainers to bear his wounded cousin to a place of safety, Cade now found himself opposed'to the man wIo had wrought his father such foul wrong.             } N4o sooner did lie recognize the person of his new antagonist, than his eyes flashed forth fires of deadly hate, and elevating his voice to its highest pitch lhe thus addressed him: Come on, thou bfe tyrant, who tramplest upon all laws, human and tivine; whose hand is red with the blood of thy fellows, whose .dungeons reek with the foul stench of thy murdered victims; come on, I say, and re- ceive firom the sword of an honest man, a nobler death than thy blood-stained soul could otherwise have hoped for; for here I swear, if alive thou fallest ;ntuo my hands, a long cord and a short shrift will be thy doom!"' " Thou crowest right shrilly, my dunghill bird, but, an' ye talk of hanging, ierchance thy turn may come anon. Meanwhile,-thy braggart tongue had best be muttering aves for him they call thy sire, for methinks thine eyes are sadly dull, they see not thi lofty state to which my kind regards have raised him!" Following the direction in which Say's eyes were so fiendishy turned, what horrid spectacle there met the giaze of the agonized son? On the very verge of a lofty turret stood his noble father, with his hands pinioned behind liln, while around his neck was placed the fatal noose, which, on a given signal, would launch tie beloved author of his days, on that voyage whence there is no return. ". lold! hlold on your lives!' shouted the bewildered leader to his men, who were imanfully doing battle in his behalf. Strike not a blow, raise not an arm, lest yon horrid sight assume a yet more dreadful phase, and thus we bring swift death to him I came to save." Turning fiercely to Say, who, Hsure of dictating his own terms, now stood gloating on the young' man's agony, he demanded of him wherefore he had played sulch a coward's part, as thus to wreak his vengeance on the un- offending head of his noble father, and what vile scheme he last had hatched for the betrayal of his sister! "Thy father, if luceh he be, aimed at the valued life of one whose blood would buy a hundred slaves like thee, and for that crime he dies. As for the girl thou pratest of, she hath a soaring eye, that loves to look beyond the gulf whereon her birth hath placed-her, and little heeds the aid of priest to help her o'er."     42            JACKi CAD ; OR, With the spring-of a tiger did the maddened Cade rush upon this taunt- ing villain, and smiting him with the pommel of his sword full in the teeth, forced back the scarce spoken calumny, whose baseness had caused him momentarily to forget the peril in which his father was placed. With the fall of Say, again were hostilities, commenced, apparently with greater fury than before. Calling Worthy-to his side, and with Gerald for their conductor, Cade hastened to seek the entrance to the tower whereon his father was still stand- ing, the anxious spectator of the strife below. No sooner did Lord Willoughby perceive this movemeint on the tu't of Oade, than he instantly divined the purpose on which hle rwas bentand iaatening to Say, who had partially recovered fronm the stunning violence of the blow, he urged him quick to give the signal, ere the prisoner sholdt be snatched from their grasp by his gallant so, who had now gone to deliver him from his perilous positions. Starting from his recumbent position, and summoning all his powers for the deadly vengeance that now raged in his breast, Say gave the concerted signal, and when Cade and his two companions gained the-spot to which they had so valiantly fought their way, they beheld the quivering corpse of him whose blood was the first libation offered on the shrine of that Freedom which our hero thereafter so nobly battled for. On regaining the courtyard of the castle, it appeared that the followers of Say had received a small reinforcement from without, and, headed by Clifford, Willoughby, Scales and otlh' nobles, were bearing all oppositiou before them. Although the return of Cade, who now raged like a c4afed lion, dealing death and destruction all around him, for a tim,ianged the aspect of affairs, yet it was evident to the less excited Worthy, that it was madness to contend longednagai st a force which was momentarily receiving additions to its strength. M) Sumlmoning Straw, erald, andt Walter to a hurried consultation, it was determined to fight their way to the postern by which they had entered, and dispersing by separate paths, plunge into the depths of the forest, and thus baffle their enemies, should they attempt pursuit. To this proposition it was with difficulty that Cade could be brought to listen, but when reminde-d by Worthy, that his chief enemy, Say, had left the scene of action, that they contended against fearful odds, and that if taken or slain, the bright dawn of England's freedom would be quenched in utter darkness, he reluctantly yielded to- their cooler judgment, resolving to live for the great object which Lacy had placed so glowingly before his enraptured gaze. Having succeeded in drawing off his followers with but slight loss, Cade and his friends speedily gained the outlet to the forest, where, speaking a hasty farewell, they separated, but not until a rendezvous had been appointed at the midnight hour 6tr Cade, Worthy, and Straw, at which, they might adopt precautions for the present and take measures for the future.   THE BONDSMAN'S STRUGOLE.            43 OCHAPTER IX. Now that the stern excitement of the battle's fierce commotion had some- what subsided in the breast of the unhappy Cade, it was with a sad and foreboding spirit that he took his leave of the few brave spirits who had, with him, struck the first blow at that proud oligarchy which had arisen like a dark cloud, enveloping the liberties of a mighty nation, and with the pestilental exhalations of its life-destroying miasma spread itself over the surface of the whole land. The suddenly orphaned youth, for young he certainly was in years, though old in the bitter experiences of life's fitful struggle, strove nobly to arouse his desponding faculties to meet the mighty emergencies which this day's doings  had so suddenly created, and it needed the full conviction of the ultimate success of the gigantic enterprise upon which he found himself embarked, to enable him to assume that serenity of bearing which it was necessary he should wear when entering that home, which the vilo tyranny of the dastard Say had so ruthlessly deprived of its protecting head. How should he meet his fond mother-how break to her the dreadful tidings of which he was the unhappy bearer? With what words could he soothe the agony of that widowed heart, which, in one fatal day, was robbed of both husband and daughter-for as yet he knew not that Grace had escaped the clutches of those fiends in human shape, whose murderous hands were yet reeking with the blood of her beloved father. Harassed and weighed down by these emotions, Cade pursued the path that led to the cottage; where his mother and sister and their good friend Lacy were sadly conjecturing what might be the issue of that struggle which Grace had borne to them the tidings of. That her son was bent on some desperate errand when he so abruptly left the cottage, the good Bertha was well convinced, and it needed all the padi- fying influence of Lacy to induce her to await within her now cheerless home the return of those whose absence caused her such disquietude. Late in the day the mother's anxious watchings were rewarded by the sight of her daughter hurrying breathlessly towards her, manifesting, as well she might, the most powerful evidences'of alarm and terror. Her tale-was soon told. She spoke of her reception at the castle, the audiences she had had of Say, and the sudden interruption caused by!a con- flict of which she was unable to give the faintest outline, for it mvill be remembered she had no opportunity of judging either of the charactcr of the parties engaged or of their numbers. Lacy now came forward to welcome and bless the girl whom he had not beheld since an infant in her mother's arms, and it was from him she first learned the arrival of her dear brother, and of his sudden departure on hear- ing of his father's capture and her own quixotic journey to the castle. While they were yet lost in painful conjectures regarding the fate of two persons so dear to them, they were starttled by the sudden entrance of the young COa1cde who, with disordered apparel, bloody hands, and broken sword,     "           'JACK CADE; OR, rushed into their midst, and with outstretched arms received the form of his beloved sister, who bounded up to meet his eager embrace. It was a few moments ere either could find words to express the pent-up feelings which struggled for utterance. "Sister!" "Brother!" was all they could articulate. The first transports of their joy having subsided, each eagerly demanded of the new comer what had been the issue of the conflict, in which it was evident he had been an active participant, and whose blood was that which was still moist upon his hands. It was useless to endeavor to conceal the facts ; the story must be told; and, nerving himself to the task, he commenced the narration of the inci- dents that had taken place from the time when last they had seen him up to the present moment. When the sad reality burst upon the wretched women, that the fondly cherished object of their affections had been so savagely murdered, as it were within their very sight, such just cries for vengeance ascended to the gates of Heaven, that the recording angel listened to their prayers and bid the avenging spirit mark with his fatal signet the destiny of those who had thus dared to arrogate to themselves the high privilege of life and death. Vain were the attempts of both Cade and Lacy to soothe the violence of *  that grief which could know no comfort. Futile was every effort to assuage the tears of these disconsolate mourners, whose every joy seemed wreked by the base murder of that dear husband and parent; and it was only when reminded of the swift vengeance which was how hurrying to sate itself on him who had provoked the wrath of their tyrant, that they courd rouse themselves to any effort for his escape or protection. Lacy being informed of the appointment which Cade had made with Worthy and Straw, determined to be present at the meeting, that, with his cool judgment and larger experience, he might so guide their counsels as to ensure present escape to these rash men, and thus preserve them for that great future which he was convinced would have so glorious a consumma- tiont Cade having unfolded to his mother and sister'the nature of the mission on which he had been sent by the Duke of York, for the furtherance of the success of which he had been entrusted with his private signet ring, it was decided that the best course for him now to pursue would be to take a hasty departure from Kent, and, availing himself of the power of Y6rk's signet, escape to some neighboring country, where, by assuming another name, and remaining inactive for a time, he might evade the hot pursuit whioh it was well known would be made for him and the others who had been engaged in that day's rebellious attack on the castle of the treasurer. Although both mother and sister were reluctant to part from one whose protecting arm they now more than ever needed, yet their selfish regrets readily yielded to the reflection of the danger with which he was sur- rounded, and having taken a fervent farewell of his mother and Grace, Cade bade an adieu to that home at which his stay had been as brief as his arrival had been suddeni and pregnant with consequences, both as regarded the present and the fttuire. i   'THE BONDSMAN'S STRUGGLE.         4 Lacy and Cade, now took their way to a cave situated in a deep recess of the forest, some two miles from the widow's cottage, which had been the place agreed upon as the rendezvous. OOn arriving there, they were agreeably surprised to find,;not only Worthy and Straw, but also Gerald and Walter, who were resolved to leave thai section of the country, knowing that it was hopeless to think of escaping the punishment in which their aid to Cade and his followers had involved them       . After imany a hearty grasp had been given and returned by Lacy and his friends, who were right glad to meet one who had ever been foremost in expressing his detestation of the bondage-under which they wore compelled to live, and one whom they well knew had suffered too much at the hands of their oppressor to make him other than a warm friend of any movement they might contemplate, whereby to shake off the yoke which so sorely galled them: -  Then in the deep security of that dark and secret cave, at that solemnn hour of midnight-these few but bold spirits listening to the soul-stirring eloquence with which Lacy unfolded to them link after link of that glorious chain of events which would ensue fromn a successful blow struck in behalf of that cause of which he wa's so devoted and energetic a champion, they felt all their latent energies aroused to action, and cordially embraced the hero whom Lacy informed them wasi to .be their leader in the glorious enterprise. It was now finally arranged that Cadc should seek safety in immediate flight; that Lacy should remain with his mother and sister, for the double purpose of protecting them, and of being on the spot to take advantage of any occurrence that might seem favorable to the rising which they contem- plated. In the meantime Gerald and Walter were to, secrete themselves as best they might, or seek employment in some other county, but to be sure to keep Lacy apprised of their whereabouts, that lie might be able to summon them at the first auspicious moment. Worthy and Straw were to endeavor to foment the present discontent which prevailed among the serfs, and so attune their ears to the sounds of Freedom, that they might be induced to rally round whatever standard gave promise of a more happy future. These plans having been agreed upon, the band separated, Lacy and Cado departing together, but not until each member of that little nucleus of the mighty power which was hereafter to achieve the-Charter of Liberty for the Commons of England, had sworn fealty to him whom the eloquence of Lacy had so conclusively sheownn could alone prove the succesful champion of their rights. Lacy and Cade, fearing pursuit, had, before leaving the cottage, disguised themselves as well as the scanty means which Dame Bertha possessed could enable them, and thus found themselves, as the sun began to tint the distant hills, once more traversing that road leading to the sea wo et whuich they had so recently travelled.       t Few were the words j olein duriing the firt two (r tihee miles of their joirltvy, fi:' the mind tf (acih was busy revolving tihe evenrts of the last     "           .JA:i CA DE; 0O, twenty-four hours, and endeavoring to draw from thence an .augury of the future. The sanguine, yet saddened, youth, who had been long taught by his aged Mentor to identify himself as the prime object in whatever might be the course to be pursued, dwelt long and painfully upon the ul :lppy result of his first direct contest with that many-headed hydra with wl;i"h it was his future destiny to cope. Notwithstanding those lessons which he had been so long and earnestly taught, he could not but feel the impotence of his unaided '!'. : when raised against that gigantic structure of tyranny, which for years had been spread- ing and growing, until it overshadowed the whole land, leaving its benighted bondsmen in the most utter darkness in regard to anything like a knowledge of those rights which belong alike to the i clh and the poor, to the bond as well a s to the free. As yet all was enveloped iti,one dark cloud, which was impervious to his inexperienced gaze, and from whictl no 1ray ,of light broke forth to cheer his onward path. In this sad and desponding firanu of mind, it needed a contemplation of all the glowing pictures which Lacy could present to his view, to bring his spirits again to that lofty pitch df enthusiasln to which they had been aroused when first lhe listened to the wrongs of his countrymen. But there was now a new chord which Lacy could strike with most powerful 'ifect. The murder of his father was a theme upon which he dilated with such glowing words, that the breast of his hearer would heave witl the thoughts of that vengeance which he vowed he would yet wreakc upon the heads of those who had so cruelly orphaned him. Having at length gained the coast, and found a craft which was soon to sail for France, Lalcy, with much sorrow and deep regret, took leave of his young friend, upon whose head he had invoked Heaven's choicest blessings, n id upon whose path he had called down the protecting influence of all those holy angels whose good offices the pious Catholic supposes are ever vouchsafed to those who pray for them. With :L heart within whose deepest recesses Lacy had succeeded in' awakening two of the most powerth passions of our nature-ambition and vengeance-Cade departed from those shores which he was ore long again to revisit; but not then as now--a fugitive from base oppression, with a soul mourning for a father's recent iurder, with feelings sore oppressed at the thought of what might be the fate of those so dear to him whom he had left behind, and with the clouded Iand unknown future before him. No! truly indeed was nall thi' changed when again he set foot upon his /-native soil. the came then, at th:e eager summons of thousands of noble hearts and daring armls, who waited but his presence to burst those bonds which at length had become too heavy to bear. He came then, as their chosen champion in a struggle as j st as ever nerved the arms of those who struck in Freedoma's cause. lie came then, to enrich his countrymen with the most bouounte s of gits-Liibrty!-possessing which they would be    T,'H BONDSMAN'S STRUG GLE.         4' rich indeed, ' for there are ao p6or where Freedom is, for Nature's gifts are affluence!"'* -       , CHAPTER X. Trim good Friar, on his return, found his friends at the cottage had been undisturbed in all respects, save n, visit from Lord Willoughby, who came, he said, to enquire of the welfare of tie charming Grace, for whose happi- ness he assured her he was most solicitous. Grace, though loth to b@. n debtor to one-whom she looked upon as implicated in the death of hel father, resolved to test the truth of his words by demanding his good offices with Lord Say for the restoration of the body of his victim, that herself and mother might at least have the melancholy satisfaction of looking on those dear 'features once again ere they consigned them to that grave which they otherwise feared would be denied to the bones of one who his nmurderer branded as an assassin and a rebel. NYow it so happened that this boon could be most easily granted, inns- lmuch :l Say was lying insensible on the couch to which he had been con- veyed the day previous. The blow  he had received, together with tie excitefment of the battle, had terminated in irain fever, which rendered him alike unTirconscious and unresisting. It was to tilis state of Say that owe Imuut ascribe the fact of no measures having been already taken to secure those who had been engaged in thc attack, .nd that thus those who sought the opportunity were enabled tc leave the country unmolested. Had he been possessed of the ability as he was of the will, it is fair to presume that not many would have been spared for the second blow, whir h was more successful in its object and more general in its consequences. Lord WiUoughby, reflecting that it ought to be his first object to enlist the gratitude of the fair girl whom he had marked as his prey, promised Grace to use every effort with his cousin to induce him to grant her prayer, at the same time impressing upon her the magnitude of the task which she had imposed rpon him, artfully concealing the fact that by his cousin's illness and the return to London of Beaufort and the other nobles, he himself was virtually master of the castle and all its inmates. Grace felt truly grateful when, a few hours after her interview with the sedtctive Willoughby, she beheld a small cavalcade 'winding along the narrow path which formed the approach to the cottage, for she knew the nature of the burden they so carefffly bore. As they placed the corso on the couch where in healthful sleep that form had so often rclined, the mourning widow :and bereaved child bent upon them a look of such thankfulness and' gratitude as caused tlh tear to starlt i n many a manly eye, to which the brawny hand was quickly raised to wipe away the evidence of a weakness of whfioh each felt ashamed, ignorant ns * Mr. Porlrelt in the character of Oade,              ?     48            JAC. CADE; OR, they were that true courage is closely allied to the tenderest feelings of our nature--Sympathy and Valour being twin sisters, whose attribute it is to feel for and to avenge the wrongs of our fellows. It was witi a sorrowing breast and tearful eye that Lacy contemplated the remains of him whom he had last seen strong in health, buoyant in spirits, and hopeful for the coming struggle. Alas, little did he deem that he himself would be the first victim offered on the altar of a country's wrongs; that his blood would be the first libation poured forth to sanctify a cause whose end and aim were so just and holy. Truly the martyr who lay there, wrapped in death's calm repose, knew not of the fate which awaited him; but, reader, think not that had the full knowledge of the required sacrifice been revealed to him, he would have for one moment flinched from the trial. No! he had set his hand to the plough and he would not look back. He loved the country of his adoption well-but he loved freedom more; and in her sacred cause was at all times ready to yield a life which lacking that, lost half its worth. In the still hour of the night, beneath the dark lsh ade of the lofty trees,. was gathered a small and solemn assembly. The widow and the orphan, the friend and the servants, with Worthy and Straw, were thus secretly consigning to the grave the remains xof him who had been sacrificed to preserve alaughter's honour, for it will be recollected that had not Grace defended her virtue by st:Kiing her dagger deep into the breast of Courtnay, her father had yet lived, to avenge the insult. This thought caused many a bitter pang to the heart of the sorrowing Grace, who would most earnestly beseech the good Friar to pray for her, that the dreadful consequences of her act might not be visited upon her in that hereafter to which she looked forward with dismay. The lengthened illness of Say and the serious discomfiture of Courtnay procured for their oppressed bondsmen a welcome respite from those exactions and forced services which had made them feel all the wretched- ness of their condition; indeed,-so much improved was their present state that they began to listen somewhat tamely to the counsels of both Lacy and Worthy, who took every occasion to arouse them to a sense not only of the - deep debasement to which they were suuk, but of the glorious cause in which they were called to enlist, for the sakes of their wives their children and their country. While admitting the justness of the teachings to which they so supinely listened, they showed but little zeal in an enterprise which they said savored more of hard knocks than hard gold-of Imore powder than porridge. Lacy despaired not, however, of awakening them to a state of activity; and his letters to Oade, which were sent by a trusty. hmanJ breathed anticipations of the most sanguine nature. Gerald, who had again sought the protection of the Dutch lugger, and had thus frequent opportunities of seeing Cade, whom he almost wor- shipped as the means of avnging himself on Say, whose cruelties in his boyhood still rankled in his)breast, was the medium of communication between them, and also of netifying Richard of York of the turn events   THE BONDSMAN'S STRUGGLE,          4 b ad taken, which had prevented Oade from fulfilling the mission with whic he had been entrusted. , Now it so happened that the opposing faction had made some miovemeni eminently successful to their cause, and of course tending to weaken that o the Yorkists, so much so, indeed, that Richard resolved not to venture upo the contemplated rising at present, but to foment by every possible moat the discontent of the Commons, and when he found them ripe for the occa sion appeal to their passions in his favor. He also, with a keen-eyed polico sought to enlist their gratitude by procuring for them occasionally a remis sion of punishment or an extension of freedom. This Lacy well knew, an he eagerly sought to make it available for the safety of his friends-th family of Cade and those of Worthy and Straw, who albne of all engage( in the attack on Say's fortress needed protection. Although the Duke would give him no assurance of his influence to pro tect the agents of so bold an aggression, it is to be presumed that le pleader their pardon, for Say, on being restored to health, took no measures t punish these offenders. N-ot so with Courtnay. H-e sought every 6ccasion to molest, annoy, amn tyrannize, not only over the widow and daughter, but also over all who lha( been engagd in that bold stroke which had provbd to him and his lori what valiant hearts and stout arms can do when enlisted in a righteous cause. The miscreant's wound, which, resulting in a useless arm, had left a sterr romembrancer of Grace's heroism, prevented his making any further attcmpl in that quarter, even if he had not found the ground already occupied by his superior alike in jirth and villany-the Lord Willoughby, who was using every appliance of wealth, station, and, nature's gifts (which he pos- sessed in an eminent degree) to undermine the virtuous precepts wit wwhich Lacy endeavored to foil his insidious attacks. When did love listen to reason; when did priestly warnings prove effec- tive against a lover's wooings? That they did not in this case, the sequel abundantly shows. Lacy, on returning to Kent from one of the numeroll, journeys he was now in the habit of making, was thunderstruck to find that Willoughby had taken advantage of his absence to carry off the lovely Grace, who, we are pained to say, soothed by his fair words and specious promises, had mado but faint resistance, especially when assured that, as soon as lshe lad beconeo his bride, her mother should dwell with them in one of those lovely spots , which he had so often painted to her as the residences of Englisl nobler. Alas! her guardian angel proved faithless to its trust, and in one unhappy moment the teachings of years were alike forgotten and disregarded. *    *             *- i       :*-  Nearly three years had now elapsed since Cade had left the shores of Kent with drooping spirits and sorrowing heprt. In the meanwhile he had not been inactive. Italia was at this time battling for freedom, and in the arm of Cade or Aylmere she found a powerful friend and a warm defender. Lacy had, as we before observed, travelled much and studied     50            JAc( cADE; OR, much, and the Italian language being that in which are written some of the finest poems on the subject of Liibrty, it is not to be wondered at that he made it one of his favorite studics, ald also limparted its knowledge, with all his other teachings, to his youthfll friend. So brave a defender, and one of so roanly and handsome a form as the gallant Aylmere, was not long in finding warm admirers in Italia's lovely daughters, to one of the most noble and beautiful of whom he was united in the bonds of love, as they already were in every sympathy of the heart; their one great idol being Liberty-Liberty for each-Liberty for all! With what kindling eye and mantling cheek did the fair Mariamno listen to the burning language that fell from her hbsband's lips, as he dilated upon the subject of England's wrongs, of the wretched serfs-of his murdered father, his widowed mother, and his orphaned sister. With what enchant- ing eloquence would this heroic woman, glancing towards the room where reposed her infant daughter, urge him by every potent word to linger no longer in lover-like dalliance, but depart on the instant to achieve a renown that should o'ertop the proudest warrior's fame-for he who strikes in his country's cause is thrice a hero. To all his wife's entreaties that he would at once begin the career which her sanguine heart had convinced herself must prove successful, he would reply, that the time had nct yet come; that Lacy, with whom he wasin constant communication, would not. fail to apprise him of the proper moment; and until tha4 did arrive, it would be worse than madness to hazard so great a stake by any act of precipitancy. Meanwhile Lacy, who possessed a perception as keen as it was calculating, was endeavoring to perfect. a scheme which, if imatuied, would add much to of the chances of success of the contemplated movement. In examining into the affairs of the elder Cade, and settling up what little property he possessed, the Friar had discovered some papers relating to matters of a purely family nature, from which it became known to him that Cade was related somewhat closely to that John Mortimer, whose exe- i    caution during the early part of the present reign had caused such ast of indignant feeling on the part of the lower orders, with whom the nalne -of ".   Mortimer ever acted as a spell to stir up all their slumbering patriotism. The mysterious resemblance of the young OCde to the Mortimer family, which had so astonished the Duke of York, when detailing to him the out- lines of his own contemplated rising, and which had long struck the good Friar s a 'most fortunate coincidence, wa now fully accounted for; and iE speaking to Grace upon the subject, Lacy learned that her father had long Jis    confided the secret to her, fearing lest it might, by some mischance, die witl 1i   himself, and thus cut off his children from any future advantage that migh from that circumstance accrue to them. After much serious consideration, ]Lacy resolved to confide the secret no only to Cadeoimnself, but also to the Duke, who, he plainly saw, would b well content to let the burden of the fight fall upon other shoulders than hi Its own. If successful, the powerfal Richard could easily avail himself of a the advantages to be reaped therefrorl; while, if defeated, the odium an   T'IE BONDSMAINS TS'I'RUGGL,. punishfment would be visited upon those who dared raise their disloyal ba ners against the red rose of Englatid. Such was the importance which Lacy attached to the fact of obtaining t assent of Richard to his scheme, that he resolved to wait upon the Dr Tn person. Having imparted to Worthy and Straw the nature of the expedition which he was about to depart, and commended to their watchfulness i Widow and her daughter, the ambitious and sagacious Friar set out on journey, and was so completely successful in the object of it, that he I only won the assent of Richard to the movement being made in the na of Mortimer, the rallying cry he had himself determined to employ, but 1 promise to further its success by every aid that he could secretly lend, whi he intimated should be forthcoming in the shape of ammunition, arms, a] provisions, at any moment the leaders of the movement might be pleased signify as the mast auspicious f6r the rising. Lacy, instantly despatched a courier to Cade, urging him to hasten to Er land with all possible despatch, pledging thiat he should be received w! many an exulting shout and welcoming hand.  To this ho. received ] answer, that Cade would take passage in the ship "L King Henry," which V shortly to sail, but that he should leave his wife and child with her fathl until he had for himself judged of the probable duration 'of the comi: struggle. The letter also requested Gerald to meet him at a certain hostel London. Worthy and Straw, who had labored long and faithfully in the task arousing the dullards to a sense of their slavish condition, were at 1. rewarded by knowing that some ten thousand brawny arms awaited i their bidding and the presence of their leader, to hurl defiance in the tee %bf the lord Say and his base minion, Courtnay, a step which to their co fined vision, was all-sufficient to effect their wished-for freedom. It had formed no part of the intention of either Lacy or his coadjutors, develop to the dull intellects of those around them the full details of t h vast enterprise. The Friar well knew that these men, though brave as lic in defence of their own families, would not be, able to grasp the great pi ject of achieving the liberties of a nation; especially, as such an enterprl would eniail upon them, dangers, privations, and probable death. CHAPTER )    ;' O  E;M day in the latter part of March r 1443, there were gathered on ai about the sands of Dover many people ot for the gratification of a cur osity called into being by aught fike a gay show had the multitude coi 'fori; the object of their earnest attention being a vessel some few mil off. e'or many hours she had been in'distress;' and so frail a thing waus that from the meuths of'many there lad comle expressions of surprise T! the waves had not taken to their depths what seemed us though fated f     52            JACK CADe; -01., It had been a fearful day. Nor was it one eleminut that imparted a wild magnificence to the scene, for hail and lightning and thunder were mingled. Yet the inhabitants f(the town stood apparently immovable; their ears deaf to all save the/awful vibrations with which the gret concave of Heaven was ringing. So great had grown the conviction that the vessel could not long sustain the struggle that was going on between itself and the elements, that the helm had been deserted, he who should have remained at his post having 'descended for the purpose of doing what many others had resorted to- namely, attempting to render the view of approaching death less terrible, through the quaffing-of strong liquor. The potency; of the liquids' drank was fully proved, laughter and jests coming from those' who a little time since were 'the loudest in their wailings; and ribald song and toast'being joined in by men who had been imploring the intervention of their patron- saints, promising offerings, and saying Ave Marias. "A thousand golden pieces to the man who will take the good bark 'King:Henry' safe to shore!" exclaimed the captain; but the offer was made more in bravado than aught else. "A thousand golden pieces 1" ho repeated; and, weakened by-his debauch, he sank upon the deck. In good faith, gallant captain?" was the inquiry of a man whose pre- sence had not; it appeared, been noticed by those near him. The words of the man, as well as the tone of determination in which they were spoken, caused a momentary sensation of wonder, which gave way to an imiression that partook very greatly of the superstition of the times; beingnb-less than an idea that the stranger was some supernatural being, sent by Providence, to succour this band of human creatures at the moment of their greatest peril. Of no common height was the man who had already become the accredited deliverer of that bark and crew; and in proportion to the loftiness of his stature were his limbs. In every sinow there was an iron strength, that looked as though it fitted the possessor for a task as great as that now, by. the consent of all, imposed upon him. Not to the frame alone had Nature confined her good gifts; the features, hair, and complexion of the man being of a high ordct of beauty. In contour the countenance was Spanish, a peculiarity in no way lessened by dark eyes, and hair of the same hue richly clustering about the neck and brows. In good faith do you proffer the guerdon?" said the stranger, when the captain had been sufficiently restored to understand the purport, of the other's words. "Aye, by St. George!" exclaimed he; " and not only shall the thousand pieces of gold be yours. but, also, a word in the way of a hint to our lord the King. "Enough," said the volunteer, and, bounding from the place which had been the scene of this little conversation, he made his way to the deck, and frp the incompetent hands to whose guiding the helm had been entrusted, he wrenched it with a strength that could only he equalled by the want of courtesy that accompanied the action,    The Lord, Clifford and Willoughby at the Dattle of Sevenoaka. With an air of authority, to which the exigences of the moment imparted something like divinity, he gave his directions. These were promptly obeyed, to the end that the bark was veered towards the shore, and ult- mately reached it.    :' By the aid of boats all were put on shore; all, it should be said, save the man to whose guiding the crew and all on board owed their preserva- tion; nor did he manifest any inclination to desert the bark until he had rescued that as well as those it had lately contained. That the bark eas preserved the loud shouts of the people on shore fully expressed. Bit they sunk into a mere whisper when compared with the greetings that were lavished upon their deliverer by the men and women he had rescued. Not trusting himself to any boat, he leaped from the vessel, now, through him secured, and was for some moments lost amidst the foaming waters. Presently, and while the eyes of the preserved were strained towards that point of the huge waters in which they had last seen their friend, the light- ning stopped, leaving the surrounding objects veiled in darkness, and again causing the ear to tremble at the fierce vibrations of the thunder. But 4     54            JACK CADE; OR, doubt was not to have a long continuance. For soon the sky above, and the earth below, the wide ocean, and the towering rocks, were bathed in light, which revealed, standing a few paces hence, the bark's deliverer. He had but a moment since left the waves, every drop he had brought' away of which seemed as though changed into a gem by the storm's alchemy. Flash succeeded flash; and, by the light so given, the saved people thronged around the man, of whose heaven-orda-,od mission none entertained a doubt. A burst of shouts that rivalled the thunder, rurg in the air; and a further succession of lightning flashes disclosed the erect form of Cade, the future Insurrectionist, in the centre of a group, knee bent and face uplifted. A few hours later; the occupants of an antique parlor in a city tavern, were brought to a halt in some grand debate respecting the various factions of the day, by the entrance of a rew-comer, in the form of a tall and well- proportioned man. In the cost ime of a gentleman of the day was he habited; and the manner in which he ordered a stoup of wine and took his seat by the side of the fire spoke the independence of one who had about him the means to pay for all that he desired. The new-comer was eyed with much attention by a young man who sat apart from the rest; and his look became more fixed every moment, until, seemingly incapable of restraining himself longer, he went up to the stranger, to whom he held out his hand; an act that lie accompanied with a kindly smile of recognition. There needed no words .to inform the new-comer who his greeter was; the mutual smile that mantled over his face, and the hearty grasp lie gave the proffered hand, saying more than words could have done. Some earnest conversation passed between the two; from the same mea- sure did they drinkOand when the hour fodeparturc came, both went forth together. When the two friends got into the street it was midnight, and completely still would have been that part of the old City The two men were traversing, had it not have been that to the usual sounds of the hour-the homeward- bound drunkard's song and the Cyprian's tread-the rushing of the Thames through the arches of London Bridge was added. JACK CADE,-or Ayllere-the Oman who had just arrived at the tavern, now abruptly stopped. After exhaling a long breath, he remarked: 4 In the hurry of greeting, I have forgot much. There ai'e many wh om I have to ask for. First, my mother-wlere is she?" To which Gerald replied, "At home and well, but borne down by a weight of affliction." Cade now put a question, the answer to which was fated to throw over his heart and brow a shade of deepest anguish. "My sister-is she well, too?" hastily inquired the anxious brother. The action of his companion's head expressed nrv. "At home " A repetition of the former action was the reply. "Not well-not home?" said theinquirer, in a voice broken by uncertainty and emotion. "What th(ntm" he added; aind he sto od, awaiting a reply, with deep anxiety in every look.    'Hi HOP'1SMAN'S 'STRU G ; l.     i  55 "I have told you that Grace is neither well nor home. Yet, oade, she is a breathing creature liko ourselves, and is, if no sudden mishap hs come, only a little distance hence. But, she-is--is----mad!" "GOD!"  words.  "And the cause of this ,?" inquired Cade, through his closely set teeth. "She has loved!"' was the simple reply of Gerald. ": And -"  . Oade would have proceeded further; but could not. He felt a choking in his throat, and so was obliged to pause. "Hlas been deceived," went on his informant.  "Tell me," said Cade, grasping the arm of the man he addressed, "tell me, does the vile seducer live?"  "He does, and has utterly deserted her."  So wronged! so deserted! who has kept Grace o from fallin g into those depths of misery and want, of which such a fate as you hae relaeed is too often the beginning."  "Though deserted by one," replied Gerald, "she has found some willing to succour her. You have heard of Leah, Lacy's deluded child--the vitim of Beaufort?" "I have," returned Cade ; " what of her?"  -"To your sister she has been a second mother; and it is with her that Grace is now living. There have been others, too, who came to your sister's help--"  "God reward them!" exclaimed Oade, again clasping his hands, and giving a glance heavenward. I must see hero to-night; yes, this very night! Take me to her, Gerald; take me to her now." The man addressed would have dissuaded his companion from so unsea- sonable a visit as that he urged, but there was a determination in his look, action, and' speech, that could not be opposed. Cade and his companion now made a hurried progress towards the dwell- ing of Leah.  Two knocks were given by Gerald. There was needed no further repeti- tion of the summons, for the lattice was opened; and, looking downward, Leah presented herself. "Who art thou? and what wouldest thou have with me at sucth an holir as this?" asked Leah. "It is!" replied Gerald; " and I would spealo with thee on matters con- cerning she who is hero with thee." "Thou shalt be admitted," said Leah. "But-"-:' seeing the shadow of Jade in the moonlight-" thou hast a companion. Before I admit thee, I must know his errand: for thou knowest well that upon my tracnk, as upon that of the hunted hare, there are pursuers," "Never fear!" returned Cade's friend: " he who is with me is 'one that ' thou wilt be glad to see."     56            JAcAC cADEI; OR, Leah shut the casement very softly, took a taper iu her hand, descended the creaking stairs, and gave ingress to her visitors. "Hush!" said the prophetess-for such was nu ir character and call ing-to Gerald and Cade, both having expresse great eagerness to ascend,'  "Hush! hush!" and to make her appeal more fo cible, she laid a finger upon A" her lip. "Tread lightly," said she in a whisper, " for she sleeps." Cade felt that his sister was alluded to; and saw in the manner of Leahk the expressioft of the solicitude she felt for her mind-riven charge. The apartment gained, Cade's eyes wandered involuntarily to the bed on which his slumbering sister was lying. Leah had, by the aid of the lamp she carried, recognised her visitor as the Insurrectionist, for his portrait had been faithfully drawn by Gerald, and, giving au exclamation of surprise and pleasure, she embraced hitm. "My sister!" Cade could say no more. And this brief sentence was only thc outgush- ing of his love, sorrow, and earnestness to gaze upon the creature he named. He soon did so. There she lay, in a slumber so cain as-but. for a light breathing that came at regular intervals--to suggest a likeness to death when, visiting the beautiful and the young, it moulds, for a little time, the form afd face into an angelic grace that seems of God and heaven a fitting image.                       ,  "God! how wasted, how worn, since last we met!" was the exclamation of fhe brother. Grace, my loved sister!" he continued, in, a passionate tone-" thou wert once a creature whose step was as light as that of a fawn; whose heart was lighter still. What art thou now.? Alas! they who are in the long sleep of which thy brief trance is but a poor copy, are not more wan than thdu. My poor Grace!" Nearer to the waking girl did Cade bead down; and the moment after he had impressed upon her lips a warm kiss, a soft, low sigh gave earnest of her return to the little consciousness the shattering of reason had left her. Noticing this, Leah, whose all but constant communion with her poor charge had caused her to have a knowledge of the plans best to be observed on occasions like the present, gently beckoned Jack 'and Gerald-the former still bonding over his sister, the latter a few feet beyond. The hint of the prophetess was soon taken, and,' directly afterwards, (obeyed. Then the old woman, after having, by the repeated action of laying her finger on her lips, imposed silence, stole noiselessly to the side of Grace; -When close to the girl, Leah placed her lips against the ear of Grace, and, in this position, having previously gone down on her knees, commenced the warbling of a kind of chant. What its precise meaning was, neither Cade nor Gerald could tell; all they knew was, that to a string of words of an oracular description there was wedded an air equally strange. A few minutes were spent in the song and its repetition.. When the latter was over, Leah, with an action she had previously employed, signified to Oade and to Gerald her willingness to theirsecond approach. As quietly as before, the two meni approached the bed.   'riE BONDSMAN'S  TRUGGILE.         5 Grace had, since her awakening, altered her position from that in which /she had first been seen, to one less recumbent. Propped up by a high pillow, her golden hair hanging loosely about her neck and shoulders; there was a hectic flush upon her cheeks, and in her eyes that look of latent fire that, in the insane, is so often met with. With all the instinctive fonidness of an infant for its mother, was the poor girl resting her head upon the bosom of Leah. Of the presence of }er brother and Gera ld she seemed to have not the least knowledge. "She has awoke to life, yet not to reason," observed the prophetess; 'l but to that she must, cre of thee she can have a ken. Sweetest Grace, thy brother is come Btack. Alas! my words are vain," continued Leah; "I have known leea words, and lighter ones than I have spoken, to!awaken the shadowed reason to a glimpse of light.

"Thine own brother, child; see, Grace, see!'" IThe attempt was succe:zfsful. TuE MND-RIVEN C(IL. RIEiO(GNJZED ]Ir BROT'!ER. The recognition was ihnmoeditacly attended by a fervent embrace, and then followed a flood of warm tears. Cade's feelings would not allow of speech for some time; nor was his first essay to give his mingled sensations of grief and joy successful. At last speech was gained. The brother was the first to utteri words ; and those were of a soothing description. They (Cade and Grace) had lbeen long separated from acih other; therefore, to that absence and: the present happy meeting-foi' happy Jack felt it for a time, and sought so to cause his sister to deemi-was the theme of the returned man's converse directed. All reference to the death of the father was, of eo'ars e, by him, carefully avoidede Ilow Clade had :poken during the few first niomeints after he had regained the power of utterance, we have already said. And in the same strain was he going on, weite, we. of': sudd, he was surprised and alarmed, too, by his sister's allusion to the circumstance upon which lie, together with the man and woman by lls side, had cause to wish for utter silence. r' Our fathler, dear brother, our kind father," began the girl, " is not hero to welcome back that son, fom1 whom his heart yearned for so many years. There passed no day, dearest brother"--and here Grace's voice was slightly tremulous--" in which he did not breathe a prayer to heaven for the welfare of his absent child. lie died-oh, lother, spurn me not whl I speak to you--lihe, thy father afs well as mine, diedl. And the cause, the cause-take away the glance of those eyes now bending o'er ime-was-was--my act." The poor girl, in giving this relation, had gone beyond her strength. Quickly as comes tlhought or the lightning flash of the clouds,; did she re- lapse to unconsciousness; whilst in which, she displayed the usual concomi- tants of her malady. COhild-like she lay, listeniang to the words of Leah, who imiuediatoely resumccd her lately resigned ttation by the pillow of her charge.     58 JACK CADW; 01, Oade felt his heart growing too large for his bosom, and he turned towards Qerald, but he had left. Cade now demanded of Leah the circumstances of his sister's fall, as also the name of her betrayer. Breathlessly he listened to the recital of the prophetess, without offering the least interruption by words of his own, but when the rank of the seducer and his land of birth were mentioned, the brother could not restrain   himself longer. '; Lord Henry Willoughby," answered Lelll, " one high in favour with King Henry, the Cardinal Beaufort, and the Protector Gloucester; ono, too, who is about to be wedded to a bride, rich, I know, and fair they tell me, but not fairer, I ween, than she who sleeps yonder." "I am glad to hear this," said Cade, his whole person shaking and his face becoming livid with passion-glad, very glad; for my vengeance will be more ample. A noble, thou sayest, detar Leah, wealthy; and a favourite at the Court of King Henry; about to be wedded, too! God pardon me for making his bride a widow)" "Thou promisest thyself more vengeance than thou wilt be capable of compassing," remarked the prophetess, very passionately, seeming to have a wish. to 'dissuade her companion from the purpose he had come to. '; Hedged in by the power and regard of a king, a powerful churchman, and the Protector of the realm, what can thy seeking, though thou art led on by justice, come to? What would thy appeal for retribution call forth? That retribution--No! Suppose thou didst brand the wronger of thy sister with the name of felon-for felon he is-in the public ways of thy fellow men, what issue would reward thee? Thine honor and thine enemry's shame? NTo! Yea, say that thou wert to confront the lordling, and strike hini dead while kneeling on the steps of the altar, with his blushing bride, how would the reason of yon poor reft one be recalled? Thou canst not tell me. (Leahl little thoight that she was thus pleading for the life of her own child, in the person of Lord Willoughby.) The man addressed thus, was too busy in the contemplations his own intentions of vengeance had filled his mind with, to heed what the pro- phetess said. Every moment, the signs of the inward passion became more manifest. Hitherto, Cade had altered his position but few times; now, however,-ho did not remlain still for the short time of ten consecutive seconds. Rising rapidly froml his seat, he would pace up and down the little room, his arms being either folded across his breast, or denoting hate by sudden and many clutchings of the hands. His fing:s, anon, would mingle with the ample flow of hair, which through the wearer's emotion, was hanging damply about his brow, cheek, and neck. Presently, he would re-seat himself, re- main silent a few seconds, and then rise again, muttering words, and, through the fierce pace he walled at, shaking the old room, whose boards creaked back an echo to each step. At length Cade abruptly stopped, and, going to the table which boro his cap, covered his head, previous to taking his departure.   THE BONDSMAN'S STRUGGLE.          59 "You have befriended my poor sister, and God reward you for such kind- ness," said the Insurrectionist. "Iii three days you will behold me again. Until then, take this. Farewell." He threw down a purse of gold; and, with a speed that baffled the at- tempted interruption of Leah, made his way down stairs. The door had been left upon the latch; so that the woman's essay to gain upon the de- parting man while she thought he was undoing the bolts and bars was vain. When Oade reached the street, the day had dawned. Earnest of a bright one was given, the sky being quite cloudless, a golden tinge bathing the east, and a balmy air wafting its course along. Towards the north did Cade go-and on and o0n with increasing speed, Without the least intention as to place did he go forward, his mind intent upon naught but the wrong done his sister. This was his sole consideration during the time taken in getting over twenty miles; nor would he have been diverted to another subject, had not a surprise brought him to a sudden pause.     , From fatigue, induced by the speed at which he had set forth, and which he had-continued, Cade had, during several portions of the day, been obliged to rest; These rests had been at different places-the road-side inn, the bank, the field. So doing, he did not arrive at the town whither his steps were taking him-St. Albans-until close upon the hour at which, during the early part of Spring, the shadows of evening fall upon the earth. It was just as the glooming was beginning that Jack, having until then gone along with his glance fixed upon the ground, had his attention suddenly aroused by the tramp of horses' feet, a mingled conversation? and laughter. Whence those sounds proceeded, and from whom, he soon learnt. A cloud of dust marked the approach of a large party returning from the sport of hawking. The first figures were those of the men whose duty it was to attend their superiors on occasions like the above. In gay dresses did they show themselves; and upon the heavy gauntleted hand of one there was perched a magnificent bird. The men having passed by, there followed, richly habited and well mounted, several persons, amongst whom there were three upon whom Cade's eyes rested very intently. There were an aged man, one younger by about forty years, and a fair woman in the first blush of her beauty. To the last named was the gallant directing an earnest congratulation; which circumstance, with the space the elder had caused to intervene be- tween the couple and himself, seemed to proclaim the lady and him-by her side lovers. But, though such was the case, the maiden paid not to the addresses of the younger man that attention which should have been given; for further than a slight bowing of the head now and then, and a languid smile, the expression of the lady's acknowledgment did not go. A sudden idea, amounting almost to a conviction, presented itself to Cade's mind. He felt sure that these were the Lord Willoughby, his future bride, and her father. He felt his blood thrill throughout his frame. And he stood in an attitude of .mazement; nor relapsed from such until long after     80            JACK CADE; OR, the sounds arising from the tram(of horses' feet bad completely died away upon the evening air. When the traveller recovered from his surprise, he saw that the shadows had increased very greatly; felt, too-and his late passion of feeling was partly the cause-that the breeze came by very chilly. He therefore resumed his walk, going towards the town, from which, as he passed along, now leaving this path, and anon striking down that, he perceived many lights coming forth. Jack entered the town through an antique gate, on which the land of men many. a hundred years dead had wrought the figures of saints, kings, and warriors. About the three avenues by which ingress and egress were taken, there were several of the men whose duty it was to watch the above described outpost of the town. They were men of large limb and great strength, and the manly comeliness of their frames was made more obvious by the shining plates of iron or steel by which their backs and breasts were  covered. In the streets there were, it so struck Cade, an array of people that, taking into consideration the population and want of traffic, seemed to say there had been some event, or would be, of interest. Into several groups had the occupiers of the streets ranged themselves; and in the midst of almost each of these little circles there had stationed himself one who was, or seemed to be, best informed upon the subject of such general interest, There were a number of gossips'of both sexes, the majority being women. These-some of whom were old, others younger, and having infants ia their arms--were very loquacious; and would, at intervals, break off from the thime of their own and fellows' converse to say a pacifying word or two to their crying or, otherwise restless offspring. Though gazing on such a scene as that presented, many a man would have contented himself with a cursory look, and then have gone forward, but there was, to (ade, a fascination in it which compelled him to pause. And not to the more prominent figures of the living picture did Jack confine his scrutiny; for, but a very little time after he had entered the street, his eyes bad wandered to- a figure closely muffled up in a dark-coloured cloak. This figure had, with hurried pace, been walking up and down the street; and while so engaged, there had come up to him a man on horseback, equally mysterious in look. A sign was passed between the two-a few words, like- wise, which Cade, from the acuteness of his hearing, and near position to the speakers, distinctly heard. "To-morrow." So said the horseman, addressing the figure which had been awaiting the other's coming. "Enough," was the laconic reply. The men separated, the rider amongst the crowd, his late companion down Xan obscure street that branched off from the right of the main thoroughfare. CHAPTER XII. JAOx having spent the night in St. Ajbans, next morning formed the   THrE BONDSMANl' STRUGGLE.         61 deterintiation to retrace his way to London. He was about to act upon this, when he was suddenly aroused hy there coming upon his ears the sound of an approaching cavalcade. To look in the direction of the noise was a natu- ral movement upon the part of Cade. He did not tarry long without hav- ing his curiosity satisfied; for, at the distance of about a quarter of a mile from the place .where he was standing, there appeared a large body of armed men. They were habited precisely like the guards spoken of as having been met about the antique gate of St. Albans, in the direction of which town they were now making their way. "Something is about to be done yonder," muttered the lusurrectionist to himself; "else, vhy the stir of last night and the approach to-day of these armed men?" A little exertion soon brought hin on a level with the riders, whose pace had been none of the quickest. If,-previously, Jack had entertained suspicions touching the business these meno wore intent on, such ;suspicions were now changed into all but certain- ty. Why this was, the reader will know, by a perusal of what follows. Cade's close vicinity to the men who formed the cavalcade permitted himl to distinguish everything. The troop was led by a couple of men, who moved about twenty or thirty yards in advance. After these came a detach-- rent; and then, a second. But between these two, there was carried a lit- ter by'six horsemen. From the heavy movement made by this, Cade was inclined to believe that something dead nvas inside-an hypothesis which the great caution obvious in the way of arrangement seemed greatly to favor. With strained eyes and firm step, did Jack follow the guards and the bur- then they had the custody of, until the gate, through which entrance into St. Albans was gained, being arrived at, constrained him to an immediate pause, that from what he there saw, he mlight be enabled to judge further. And what was there gone through was calculated to make him do this. It seemed that the whole of the men who had been seen on the previous night had received instructions to come forth, and to join their fellows in the performance of some ceremony with which the contents of the litter was to be associated. In rude military fashion was the augmented troop mar- shalled; and with slow step, and having their arms on the guard, did the men move onward, leaving the gate to the custody of a few of their corn- pauious--at whom Cade vouchsafed only a look. In the wake of the procession did he go, meeting, when past the barrier, an array of people equal to that which had commanded his attention on his first arrival in St. Albans. But there was an alteration in the manner of those who forfied the crowd. No longer engaged in conversation, they wore upon their faces a serious look; and if now and then. speech was indulged inl by a few, such speech went not beyond a few words, which were uttered with all the accompaniments of fear and gloom.        1 Through the town did the cavalcade go, neither turning to the right nor to the left, until the opposite entrance of the chief street had been gained. Then it was that a path, rather to the right, was taken, and which led, it so appeared, to a piece of waste ground.       t 5;           .                        . *     62            JACKICADE; OR, Along this path, as well as on the ground which seemed to mark the des- tination of the officers, there were, as there had been in the street of St. Albans, many people. But still to Cade, who abstained from questioning any of those about him, the end of the present business continued to be somewhat doubtful. However, le was not to continue lo:-: unsatisfied, the lnomnltarily narrowing space between himself and an' object which had already commanded his notice, convincing him that the last penalty of an inhuiian la- was going to be inflicted upon what could no ni.' really suf- fer from1 that law, or any other law man or devil could mn v... Gradually, as our awakening to some reality; at first supposed to be no more than a dream, did Cade come to a cognizance of the object before him. A gibbet!" he exclaimed, as the form of that frightful thing was fully revealed to him; i and for whom? One to whom the law has done its worst, having the power to kill, and so, killing. Even vengeance might be satisfied with taking life-in gazing on the contortions of a swaying human being; In marking the pallid hue that Death spreads over the lately pulsating form of man; in counting the sweat drops that pour in a heavy and dull shower from the flesh; in hearing the stifled groans which the last warfare calls forth-in these, it would be thought, that creatures but a little lower in hate to us than our Great Enemy, might find themselves satisfied. But to thus carry on the battle with the dead, upon whom the red worm of the grave is the legalized battener Faugh! 'Tis a stain upon the code on which we are taught to look with love and reverence-it is a blot upon the name of man; and on the pale ermine of the enthroned judge affixes blood spots." While speaking the above words, Jack continued his onward movement, and when the last word had passed his lips, he was within a stone's throw of, the thing he had apostrophized. The little advance which the authorized persons had gained was lnot suffi- cient to have allowed them to progress far in their duties. Further than the close hemming in of the gibbet and immediate barrier they had not gone, when Cade arrived as near the former as any in the crowd gathered about possibly could. Soon, however, was the dead form of the man, intended to serve the birds of the air for a carnival, brought before the view of the throng. The criminal had been deprived of life in its spring time. This wA manifest; for about the countenance and figure there were the undeniable signs of youth. Favourel by nature had he been, his features being regular and handsome, his hair flowing, and his limbs cast in a mould that, like the stalwart branches of the green oak, argued a wholesome strength. As the body was, by the assistance of a few of tha guards, lifted upon a temporary stage, that the securing it on the gibbet might be more easily and readily accomplished, there ran throughout the dense mass of people below, a thrill of something like horror; and during the performance of the disgusting duty there arose-at first very faint, but gradually increasing into a fierce upoar--cries of "Shame," and the like. Heedless of those, the men on the little stage went on with their work. It did not require much time. A bolt shot here--a ohain wreathed there-   TTE BONDMAN'S STRUGGLE.    '      68 and a nail rivetted in another place-these comprised everything that was wanting. And between the sky and the earth the young man's body was suspended. ' On to the rescue!"' Cade knew the voice that spoke these words. In the direction whence they came hle immediately turned, beholding, one of the figures he had met on the previous night. The order given in the above words was accompanied by the man's hastily throwing aside his cloak, as hastily jumping on horseback, and, accompanied by hi late companion, and heading other mounted men, dashing through the vielding, ranks of the multitude, towards the gibbet. The battle or skirmish now commenced, and furiously. Apprised of the movement made against them, the officials prepared to meet their assailants, putting their horses in position, and couching their lances. The two parties met, exchanging blows that rattled upon head piece, -breast-plate, and gauntlet; at the same time that from their place under' and about the gibbet, the men who had been there stationed previous to the arrival of the criminal's body, were easily beaten by those amongst the inol who had looked, with the greatest abhorrence, upon the day's doings. Cade was one of those; and impressed by his determined looks, lofty stature, and readiness, more than a hundred stout fellows placed themselves under his guidance. But owing to the fierce passions, only a little time since called up in the bosom of the men led on by Cade, they could not, try whatever they might, - loosen the body from the gibbet. At another time, a title part -ould have unrivettcd the iron fastenings; now, however, they would not give way, remaining as strongly proof against the efforts of the assailants, as though, instead of the thews and sinews of stout manhood, the tiny and weak grasp of infancy had been called into use.  Yet gaming ground as the throng was, the gibbet and its dead load could not be suffered to remain where they were. At the foundation of the blaok and hideous framework was the strength of a band of men applied, through which the whole came toppling down, with a crash that interrupted, for a few momenttdhe' struggle then going on. "Well done bravely done," said the man who had lately divested him. self of hiqi cloa : "we shall cheat the hell hounds yet." With a flushed face, and brandishing in his right hand a long. sword, such as was worn in the time of the sixth Henry, he moved nearer the prostrated scaffolding. His first impulse was to wrench from the gibbet the form which had been there secured. This he soon accomplished, and when the corpse had been taken from its ignoble exaltation, it was consigned to the keeping of a set of trusty men. This act was the sign for an increase of hostilities. More concentrated / than before became the attack on both sides. A few extra blows exchanged between the warfarers, and the fortune of the day seemed to bo going in favour of the legalized party. But this turn was speedly rendered of no avail; and by the address of a single man-Cad&. :Thus it happened. The 16ader of the guards, who had been stationed  .i     "           JACK CADE; OR, about the scaffold, approached the spota w;hiOh (Jade was standing; no sooner had he done so, than-flus, xf dAubt, with the prospect then held out of conquest-he did that wt h o4 a hired shedder of blood could do-struck down a poor, inoffenive wo  one who held a mere infant in hei arms, and whose zealous endeavours Aad been directed to her own and offspring's extrication from the 'crowd. To the ground fell the poor creaturetihder the attack of her ruflianly assailant. Though not killed, a desperate wouind had been inflicted on her neck; the red stream flowing from which mingled with her and her child's hair, and deluged their features and hands. "Miscreant p' exclaimed Cade. Who felt as though he had been just en- dowed with the strength of a lion. And he thrust his sword through the body -f the man , who fell, a dead load upon the earth, whilst lying on which, Jack contemplated his features for a time, then lifted up the woman and her babe. Having secured both by taking them in his disengaged arm, he ran towards those who still continued near the gibbet, brandishing the weapon that had wrought so justly, and from wlho(se every pore a bloody sweat seemed to exhale. Wherever Jack appeared, a lane was readily made for him. Still with the woman and child in his arms he went on, his first wish being to take them to a place of comparative safety. Tlhis he accomplished; and directly after, fearing that the strife would terminate in opposition to those on whose side he had been acting, returned to the. scene of action. Withwit a leader-for the occupation of the men whom Jack had first be- held on the previous night prevented their being of anything like service to 'the people-the contemners of the ceremony which had just been witnessed were giving way in masses. . Oade's eye was ready in detecting this. lie rc-appeared. Nothing could exceed the enthusiasm with which lhe was greeted by the huge crowd, some amongst whom had received wounds that either made them the more eager for vengeance on the givers, or now emulated them to another onset. As before, Jack took upon himself the office of leader or captain. Con- tinuihg to wave his sword above his headt with one hand, while with the other he did the same thing witl his plumed liat, he went onward; those behind him appearing to have no fear of an encounter with the soldiery; but, on the contrary, to be most willing to rumwh into the gory embrace of death.           *  They-the people and the guards-Z'met in conflict. For some time, one party could not be distinguished from the other. However, a separation took place. But this served only to show how many lives had already fallen a sacrifice in the fray. When a little space was left between the opposing hosts, there were seen in heaps, men in frightful disorder, piled upon each other in all fashions. 'Those earliest killed were, for the most part, prostrate on their backs, the warm stream of their lately extinguished being mingling with sand and grass. On .them, another deposit of bloody and riven flesh had fallen-some on their sides, others on their faces; but all in ghastly attitudes frcm which the eyes of all would have turned away with horror.    / THEa BONDSMAN S TRUGGLE.         65  The namber of the slaughtered was, as-will be conjectured by the reader, more on the side of, the people than on that of the soldiery. And the know- ledge of the success that had waited on their efforts, gained by such atlb. templation, made the latter commence their new onset with increased' iggr. But they knew not the skill and power of the man by whom the adverse party was led on-did not know it until his prowess became self-evident.! Before it they shrank. As a being gifted with superior faculties, he moved about, destroying with his own sword, and, by example, making the blows of those of whom he was captain tell fatally upon the better-appointed bodies of the guards. After he and those he had led had been thus battling for some time, tho two men who had been foremost in taking the criminal's body from the gib- bet, re-appeared, and instantly came to the assistance of Cade. This gave a decision to the struggle. Not singly, but by many, did the soldiery give way; and as they did so, the shouts of the more fortunate became louder, and more triumphant. Yet, there were some who, true to what they considered their duty, remained firml-men who kept their ground, and were determined to do so until they were struck dead or helpless upon it. So they were. )thers of their fellows, were not so resolved; but were driven, like so many sheep, before the strength of Cade and his party. After the pursuit had been carried on for some time under an hour, and while advised thereto by (ade those whom he had led on wore returning, he encountered, for a second time, the two men who had been so fully em- ployed in the late skirmish. One was, with the assistance of a few trusty followers, holdingguard over the body that had been rescued from the gib- bet; whilst the other (he whom Jack had first noticed on a previous occa- sion) had but just relinquished the labors which, like those of our hero, were directed to a good end-the peaceful dispersion of the crowd. Jack was instantly recognized by the pair. The duty of one prevented his making those acknowledgments of gratitude which, from his fellows, were poured forth with great volubility. Yet, he contrived by the expression of his countenance, as well as sundry wavings of the hand, to signify that the part which Jack had lately played was neither forgotten nor unappreciated. "Now, by the blessed Rood," vowed the other horseman, as he rode up to Cade, and, without. any preliminary, grasped his hand in his; "what thou hast done to-day shall never be forgotten, whilst those to whose just help thou hast come so timely, live. Stranger, there are many that bless thee for what thou hast done-many more, who wait but for the relation, that will, ore the sun, now verging towards the meridian, hath set, add their prayers to the ones before breathed for thee. On thy head, stranger, will the bles- sing of the mother fall; for thy soul's weal will the widow-the law- widowed bride of yon man-kneel to God; and to her passionate entreaties will there be united those of brother, sister, child, friend. Farewell, gallant man. Duty to the dead calls me hence; but we shall meet again. Fare- well! and be the smile of thy God ever on thee!" The above words were uttered with great fervency; and directly they     "            J -c, CA'DE; OR, were out of the speaker's .oo uth, lie 'grasped, once. ulore, the hand of Cade. Ere the next three moments could have been counted, he was out of sight. Left alone with the men he had led, JacI's only occupation was to dia- suade them from the pyrpetlation of those acts of violence which he saw all were ^eady for. To prevent the throng-now, through him, victorious- from falling into the excesses which commonly mar a good cause, he did his utmost. "Men, disperse in peace!;' he exclaimed, at the top of his voice. "Ye have seen a wrong committed, and have chased from their ignoble work the law's agents. What would ye more?" But his words were weaker than water. Those who, in the hour of need, had been content to obey the behests of a man they would now not listen to, called for an immediate return- to the town of St. Albans-in whose unguarded streets, and uproi hose defenceless inhabitants, it was their in- tention to wreak the vengeance newly awakened in their breasts. "On! on!' cried a thousand voices, which were accompanied by the rais- ing of an equal number of weapons. "On! on!" and the air was rent with, the words. Yet, Oade, even in this strait, did not slacken his endeavors to cdll back the minds of the crowd to reason. However, useless were all his efforts, for those who but a little space of time since had looked upon him as their only help, now hustled past him, in fury; only restrained from inflicting on his person the wounds which they were determined to give elsewhere,' by their haste to begin a bloody warfare upon the people who lived in the neighboring town, and whom, they felt assured, were not'in a state to offer the slightest resistance. Like madmen or-what lunacy renders its children akin to-devils-did the crowd hurry towards St. Albans, leaving the dead and dying to them- selves. For several hours did the insurgents hold undisputed sway of the town. It was in vain that to their mercy appeals were made-in vain that the mother droppded upon her knees, and asked the life of her young child; as vain, too, was it. that the hoary-haired grandsire begged that to heaven might be reserved its own high prerogative; that the girl with dishevelled hair cried, "Spare me " or that the infant, not knowing how to use its little tongue, looked for mercy, in the face of its infuriated butcher. Houses were razed to the ground. A multitude of torches had been placed against the foundations; and when the dry and old timbers caught the flame, there arose from the crowd a yell, triumphant and loud. The morning passed, noon,. too, had come and gone; even the splendor of evening had been shining on earth and in the sky-yet the hubbub and the bloody carnival we have been describing had not been brought to a close. When night came, it seemed as though the thirst for slaughter had been somewhat qualified; but such gave way only that another passion might, in its prostitution, be pandered to-drunkenness.. Nor was this all; for as the fumes mounted higher in the brains of the blood-marked debauchees; a frightful license was given to violence, which, tlough not bloody, was more hideous far. Cade would have added to his former endeavors to stem the tide of des- truction, then sweeping onwards, had he witnessed anything that could be thought favorable to the success of such. As he did not, he left the men to themselves; and, avoiding the town, shaped his course homeward, or, it should rather have been said, to London. But Jack was not to be solitary during the time engrossed in his journey to the capital. Turning an angle of the road, ho came upon a small party of wayfarers, upon whmn he had not looked live secopns befire he recognised in their M .-   THE BONDSMAN' STRUGGLE.  persons some of those he had met at St. Albans. The people who com- posed -the group wore the same look as when first seen by Oado; and' between them and himself there passed a mutual recognition, that, in its sincerity, gave each confidence to mingle in the conversation that afterwards took place between them. "We have met before," said Cade, who was the first to speak. "Aye, marry, sir, we have," replied the person spoken to "Whither goest thou? To London? Thither we go?"  The party upon whom Cade had thus stumbled, consisted of an old man, his two sons, and their wives. Hubert, the eldest son, acting as spokesman. Cade having replied that lihe was travelling to London, it was resolved to keep company. Hubert, who seemed to entertain no iwish that there should be oveu a moment's pause in the coinvesat'ion, thus addresscod Cade: "A fiay, good sir, that Which was seen this morning, a few miles hence- a goodly fay, if the virtue of such affairs is to be sought in the number of lives lost, the blood spilt, and the noise msade."' "Wast thou in it?" carelessly inquired Cade. "No!" answered the o na spon to, we evole ot. It was enough for us to know-and we did so, froio the report of what had been lately done, and the sight of tho multitude, whose appearance greeted us on our arrival in St. Albans-what was brewing, to constrain us to absence. Thou art later from that part than ourselves. Say: how went the battle? I mean, if thou knowest; for thou mayst be ignorant as I." - "When. I left," returned Cade, "the play of spoliation and blood was going on right merrily. Flushed with their temporary conquest, the people who opposed the guards and soldiery were revelling in all manner- of excesses. Not sufficient for them was} it that they had razed the gibbet to the ground; neither, that from it they had taken down the body of a dead criminal. Unsatcd were thev. And what ensued ver,   laoi  fled rapine and waste."              wer   o  ofie, "Ae', the gibbet and he who they fastened upon it!" remarked Hlllert. T iihi lest thou not, courteous trangr, that to first take away life, and then to hang a corpse up to dry in the ail, is rather too harsh a punishment for one whose crime-if crime it can be called-was venial?" "  A doom too savage for a murderer, I say," exclaimed Jack, passionatly. "But," he 'ontinued, "dost thou say that he whom I behold taken from the gibbet had perpetrated only a venial crime?" "I do " returned Hubert. "ell; that  venial crime:--what was it?" inquired Ade, eanger in Mfis ' wish to be informed. "That I will tell thee," answered Jack's companion. "lie whom thou dildt behold taken from the ignoble place, was - -" The man would have proeeded with what had been a question of interest to CJade, and was momentarily growing more so, but that the continuance of his speech was prevented by the sudden exclamation of his brother. The party had reached a great eminence which, though a considerable dis- tance from  the town of St. Albans, placed them in a positjen to witness what had so suddenly called into 'play the speech of one had hitherto been almost silent.                  ha "  See! see!'" exclaimed the old man's youthful son. yonder! And he had not been deceived. Many miles off, but in such a direction as th point out the towA which the party had lately left as the spot of the conflagration, there arose a huge volume of light which, though not distinct Aflae to the eyes of the travellers, was too expressive of fire to be long duotfuli  The day--at first 'a bright, merry, and beautiful one--had grown dark f   the presence of new and gathering clouds, long before its poper time for so doing; and these accidental shadows lending to the contrast of the     68            JAOM CADE; Olt, far-off illnmiuatioas, .that part of the heavens towards which the travellers' eyes were directed, grew, in proportion, more ruddy and angry in aspect. As if spell-bound, the six stood upon the ground, erng the far-away fire. This action rendered them, for a little time, insenRiitJe to the change which had taken place in the weather; and it was nottintil tOAe increase in this change forced itself upon their notice, that they took their eyes away from the object whidh had so strongly attracted them; or duly felt the propriety of seeking that shelter which their late abstraction had rendired them oblivious of. The rain now dceus(el d in tlhickl ld licavv drops, each one 'Qf which seemed as though it was loaded, anld tell )potln the face splashingly. In their dilemnma, Clde, and the younger men with him, having a fear for the grey hairs of the elder, and showing a greater one for the delicate and but poorly clad forms of the women, were earnest in their gaze for aught that betokened the neighborhood of any place in which'they could seek a shelter, and fortunately beheld the glimmer of a light at some distance. The place whence the light had slonc was a small cottage, very old. If stood in a barren field, to whichl ingress was had over some hurdles, trod- den or beaten down heie and there, and, like the habitation they bounded, discolored through the united agency of years, neglect, and the changes of weather. Noiselessly did the tparty tmake for the door; but the lack of any signs of their approach was not in consequence of caution, those who formed the little band deeming that-no objection to their shelter would be urged. To the softness-of the grounrd,' an the loud wind which was blowing, must be referred tlih surprise-which the travellers' summons caused the inmates of, the cottage. . Hubert knocked lightly at the (oor,. No lanswer, was returned-though, from the act which immediately followed, he and those with him could not think othervise than that the knock had been heard, and by the hearers was intended to remain unnoticed. The light was either extinguished or re- moved to a portion of 'the little building whence it could not come to the party without; and the finer hearing of Jack, Hubert, the younger brother, and the two women, rendered a low muttering of voices distinguishable. Yet, however strong may have been the wayfarers' opinion of the objection of the present inJlabitants of the cottage to afford a refuge from the inclem- ent night, all attempts in th? way of bringing theta to a better mood were not to be relinquished. -"We are travellers and strangers, good people," began Hubert--'the night, thou knowest, is a rough one. We ask only for shelter from its cold and wet.?  Two miles further on is a house much better suited for travellers, than is this poor shed." "But," said Jack, who since his arrival on the spot had not spoken, the distance thou hast named, though little to some of us, is what, on such a knight as this, three with us could not walk. In our company there are two women and an old man. The garments of the first drip with wet; and from the hoary head and brows of the grandsire the said rain falleth down as it is wont to do from the eaves of a dwelling. We ask thee not to give us shelter for the sake of charity; though, in such an hour as this, a boon asked in the name of that holy quality, might well be granted. For,the shelter of thy roof, friends, we will pay; also, for the warmth of thy fire, and the rest to wearied limbs found in thy straw. Pray ye, admit us. On. such a night as this, the very dog of thy bitterest foe might claim compas- sioi." "'Tis he I 'tis he!" exclaimed a voice, which to Cade was not unknown. The next moment the door was willingly opened, and the travellers were admitted.   THE BONDSMAN'S STRUGGLE.        .  0] - Cade's Midnight Address to his Followers on Blackheath. CHAPTER XIII. CADE and those with him were ushered into a small apartment, the furni- ture of which was scant, 6ld, and shabby. Their conductor was a man, whose stature was alittle above the middle; and who bore about his person sundry tokens of moving, or having moved, in a higher sphere than the present association of dwelling argued. He seemed to be about forty--good and regular were his features--rather fair his eyes, complexion, and hair; and about his visage there was an ex- pression of sorrow, which attracted, rather than repelled, the good opinion and liking of those with whom he had become so suddenly acquainted, "Thy pardon, travellers," said he: "the door should have been more readily opened to thee, had not our close neighbourhood to men of unlawful ways caused us to be somewhat cautious. Now that thou art here, thou shalt have all that our poor cabin affords. Hero, Elizabeth, pile upon the hearth some dry logs, these strangers stand in need of warmth: the old man and ' the women more so than the rest. I will help thee in thy work." He did as he had professed. Accompanying the old woman, lie went to an outer shed or little apartment; whence he and Elizabeth returned, well laden with fuel. This was quickly added to the smouldering embers of a former fire; and, mingling its new flames, threw upwards a clear column of light. 5 *           us           w     JACK CADE; OR,  "Well done," said the man, approvingly, eyeoing for a short time the fire. "Well done. Now, sit thee down, and call the chilled currents of thy blood back to their proper heat. But warmth is not the only thing thou standst in need of. No; food and rest must be added. Both we can give; though I deem the pillows' thou wilt have to place ty heads upon willbe harder than what we spread thy board with. Elizabeth, the travellers are hungered and athirst.

Th" e contnued pointing to the viands, "is the supper e can furnish thee withal.

In a corner therewere huddled a quantity of sacks--certainly not very inviting things to theux..urious, but sufficiently comfortable to those who were earied, hungered, adw. The women exptid wth a fervour which could only have accrued from former inconvenience, upon present comfort. Nor were words their only expression; for brow,' eye, and cheek, joined in to say how timely had bcn rthe help awarded. At length, five persons out of the six, who formed the wandering party, retired to rest. Oade -was the one who remained up; and his place was the same it had been since hIb entrance to the cottage-in a nook by one of the sides of the chimney. lie would have gone to sleep had he been able. Often. had he wooed oblivion to his soul; but, still in vain. Yet in her drowsy embrace he was folded at last, but was speedily aroused by some voices at the door exclaimn- ing "Open, I say, open!" This demand came from inmany moen, w;lout the cottage. And the firm manner in which they spoke was a sufttrient guarantee that they were armed with authority., "Open, for whom?" were the words which Jack, suddenly starting from 'his seat, distinctly heard. they were spoken by the man who had given him and his companions shelter; nor was the tone of determination that ac- companied them, a degree less than that manifested by the speaker without,. "T hat thou shalt know when we have gained admittance," replied the man who had demanded such. 1 I give no parley unto thee, farther than this; thou art strongly suspected of having aided and abetted divers des- perate men in wresting the law from its proper end-in other words, taking from a gibbet the body of a condemned malefatoI r for the purpl'OS Of giing to it burial. I will speak to thee no more than to repeat my legal demand. Open, I say, open-in the King's name." "at I ha ha I That for then; those who sent thee hither; and the King, to boot!"So the man who was Cade's s heltorer derided the threats of the new-comers. Jack had been an attentive listener -had noted eaoh word and every movement that had been mnatie either by those in or out of tie cotttago. From what transpired without, he was led to imagine that the soldiery-- for such he no longer doubted them to be--wore but few in nnmber; yet neverthelesq, more than suflcient to quell any resistance the ilhabitants of the cottage might think fit to offer. lHowever, thil imprOa-ion gladually died away, as to the ears of Cado there came, from an upper apartment the heavy tread of several men; thile eltankof swords and other arms, and a low   TIlI:E BONDSMAN'S STRUGGLE,        71 muttering. That there were more under the roof than at first, or even until now, he could have imagined possible, was a fact fully demonstrated to hib in a few seconds. An attack was made at the door, which readily yielded. Then entered the men, who were, in number, about six-all armed, and, from the opposi- tion they had met, doubly zealous to discomfort the inhabitants of the place. But there was given them a repulse which they most likely had not expected to encounter. This was in the firmness of the men up stairs, and also of Jack aud the two younger men whose companion he had been on his march and in his present abiding place. Those up stairs had, as it will be known from what we have said, been advised of the struggle which was about to take place. Not so-with thed solitary exception of Cade-the people who took their rest in a lower'poftion of the frail building, the change from a sleep that was, apparently, most wel- come, profound, and refreshing, to a kind of half consciousness of the real state of things, being the event of a moment. Hubert-his younger brother, Henry--and dade, banded themselves on the side of their friend. So, too, would the father, had his strength have permitted it. "The poor old man made one essay-a feeble one it was-to show that the day had once been when he could wield a weapon, but, weakened much by the act, he sunk upon his rude couch; on which- childlike-he relapsed into the slumber from which he had been so quickly aroused. The opponents met in combat-met as men whose determination it was to die before they yielded. Many were the blows exchanged; many the confused noises that rung in that small dwelling on the heath. And as the fray between the two became m'ore desperate, the ur'eks of women were added. Immediately after the utterance of the words reported to have been spoken by the man who was the accredited possessor of the ottage, he and those with him had confronted, face to face, their besiegers. ]een was the con- test, but it was one shorn of its peril and inequality, by the timely help of C0.de and those with him. Each man out of the three, able to wield a weapon with anything like effect, was in action. Blow was returned by blow-weapon rattled against weapon- and breast was opposed to breast. As a miniature of the greater contest of whichl the streets of St. Albans had been witness, soon became this fray upon the heath. They shall not rob us of what we hold-no, though they hack our flesh Ficcmoeal, and leave it to whiten on this soil. They shall not conquer us, while within our arms there rests the power of resistance." Such were the words spoken by a voice that Cade had no difficulty in re- cognising as belonging to the man/ who had poured forth blessings on his head dut ing the enactment of a late event. But the face of the man was ob- scured by his martial costume; which-putting aside the fact that the present business tould not allow of any scrutiny-was quite sufficient to check curiosity. "On, on  h to the rescue of the body!" cried the leader of the soldiers. "They have it here; and we mnust take it from them, at our dearest peril On, on. Spare none of them." "Desist from- thine efforts, agents of a hellish law!" exclaimed Cade; "and depart without that upon which the fiat of its Maker is already im- pressed. Leave t4;e dead to us-us who will bury it, in peace." The words of Jack, so far from being attended by a favourable result, only gave to the men to whom he spoke a higher incentive, for resistance. "On, on! lleed not yon madman's words," was the leader's cry. It was often) repeated. And those with him strived their utmost at obedience. Thus they went on for a long time--so long a time, indeed, that the gradual decrea{sii of the storm left them still at'their employment.     JACK CADZ; on, The combat had commu enced with a fury that told, o: sceuied to tell there would be ing giving way on either side. As on a former occasion of the like description, Cadhlad become the ac- credited leader of those with him. With sword in hand he had met the soldiers and their leader, on the. very threshold of the cottage; and had stood for some minutes, as the partition between the two parties. In the dark had the combat been waged. Still, however, Jack remained without a wound or scratch, as fa as he knew; wielding his weapon, it seemed from the noise, to the evil of those with Whom he was contesting. "Forbear! be thou whom thou mayet," was the order of the captain of the invading band. "It is useless forhe the o ge war against legal Authority. Therefore, surrender, and crave the mercy a continuance in thy present temerity will place beyond the reach of granting. urrnr I say ther "o ' Surrender I contemptuously rejoined Jk: "nee rather thou take the word from us. Merocy we neither ask, want, nor seek it. Surrender thou!"' This daring gave fresh zeal to the men who had come hither for the recovery of the creiinals body. An onset, more fierce by far thanany that had preceded, was made. As the parties approached each other then fell back their swords and other weapons rattled: the heavy fall of a body would at intervals be added. And it was over such that the soldiers, in. trying to get further into the little building towards which they' had been led, and their opponents, in forcing them back, fell indiscriminately. n"To the stair-head! to the stai-head!" was the cry of the leader, to Yreolute stand bwte his men. They were about to obey him, when a more resolute stand be ing made by the besieged, their efforts to mount,were baulked. "Up, up  the same inan continued. A repetition of the order was on his lips, when, receiving the thrust of a sword from an unknown lxandl, e staggered, then fell, dead and bleeding, on the ground. Deprived of their leader, the lnuel whom he had headed exhibited, in their movements, unequivocal signs of giving way. No more, with the concentrated strength of a body owning one impulse, one duty, did they pro- ceed; but in an individuality, and utter isolation from each other, which well argued what would be the result of the night's business. Quicker than they had gained entrance, were the soldiers beaten back, retracing their path over the prostrate bodies of their late comrades. And but a few minutes elapsed, ere theo cottage ha& been cleared of them, and they had, by Jack, the old man's sons, and three or four of the other male occupants of the sequestered shed, been driven a considerable distance. The retreat having been taken over a track unknown to the soldiers, the mishaps they experienced were proportionately many and great. Into bog, marsh, and swollen stream, did they fall; all tokens of which were a splash, a cry. Then the place was quiet, save for the wind, the des- cending rain, and the tread of -the victors. No sooner had Oade and his fellow-pursuers become acquainted with the utter inability of the soldiers resuming the attack, than they prepared for their journey back to the place whpla ce they had set out. But re they 'eommenced their quick march-and why it was quick, we shall have to ex- plain anon-there passed between Jack and the two men he had encountered previonsly, some words. "1 Again have we to thank thee," said the man, who had been so eloquena in his thanks during the late fray near St. Albans; " for thou hast this doay added another claim upon the gratitude of many. And as we feel towards thee-yea, as we will hereafter act-so may. He who is ever our greatest help, &el and act towards us." The mnan's manner was quite as fervent as before. le accompanied his professions of attachment and gratitude, by wringing Cade's hand, an aotion   THE BONDSiAN'5 S 8' TRLU LE.       73 imitated by his fellow, who said a few words, which, though not so calmly uttered, and, therefore, less distinct, were, the person spoken to well knew, the outpourings of a heart that deeply felt its debt of gratitude. "We must on, and quickly as we can," said he who had been the first to thank Cade. "We have much to do; but little time in which to do that much; and soon, most likely, will one or two of our assailants contrive to give the alarn to others. Strangers"-the speaker's manner became more. earnest-" strangers, wilt thou abide by us for a little time? Say, wilt thou help us'to give to its proper earth the poor form thou did'st look on a little time since, and for the rescue of which we have dared so much?" Though Cade, Hubert, and Henry, were addressed collectively, the former was the most particularly appealed to. "We will," burst from the three men's mouths, simultaneously. "Blessings on thee!" exclaimed he who had asked for his companions' assistance. "On, then, on; and quickly, too-; for all, to be done well and secretly, must be concluded ere break of day.'? Nothing further was needed to render each person solicitous of retracing his steps as quickly as possible. As those who were the best acquainted with ttle bearings of the ground to be got over, the late occupants of the cottage took the lead, and were followed closely by Cade and the old man's SOIL S.                     -    .  a When the cottage was reached, there stood at the door, old Elizabeth, who was ready at recognizing those for whom she had been waiting. "They are here-all here; and unhurt," was her exclamation. And, giv- ing utterance to a-short thanksgiving, she crossed her arms over her bosom, in token of the faith she professed.            i No second exclamation from the lips of the old woman was required to acquaint those within the cottage of the men's presence. Accordingly} they were met on the threshold by those whom they had left behind, and whose spirits had been fearfully swayed, between the influences of dread and ex- pectation. Each man was greeted with great joy and nmany embraces. But, from the latter they were constrained to tear themselves, the calls upon their time prompting them to immediate action. "We must depart instantly-all!" exclaimed the two men who had been the leaders homeward of Cade and the two brothers, Hubert and Henry. "Folrow!"  A melancholy scene had b)es enacted in the upper room. There the body of the rescued criminal had been lying; and it was thence that it was now about to be moved to its last resting place-a secret grave. A covering had been prepared; and the body was taken down the stairs with great care, but without any inconvenience. All who had been abiding in the little cottage took their departure. To the surprise of Cade, these were more numerous than he had anticipated. To those whonm le had already seen there were added an elderly woman, one younger, and of such rare beauty, that even beauty's canker-sorrow- had not been capable of obliterating what, in better times, must have been a choice assemblage of charms, and a child-a girl of about six years of age-who was much like her mother. "I told thee," said the man who had previously blessed Cade-"J told thee, stranger," lie repeated, while his whole frame shook with emotion "that to the brother's prayers for thy soul's weal, there would be added those of parents, wife, and child. We,-and by the peculiar action observed it was plain to perceive that the speaker alluded to himself and the man a little older-"-' have already called blessings on thy head. Take thou those of the father and mother who have witnessed the extinctioA of the lifo they gave; the wife of the murdered one's bed and heart, and the child of his loins. Behold!" and while speaking these words, the young man's form and speech trembled greatly with emotion-" he who from the felon's gibbet     "           JACK CADE; OR, Cade was immediately surrounded by the remaining relatives, who almost overwhelmed him with their gratitude. The body of the young nm l. was now hastily placed in a pit which had been dug for its reception. No sooner had it been thus disposed of than the loose earth was flug upon it, so as to leave no trace of the work. To suc- ceed in this attempt, was a matter of difficulty; but, notwithstandirng, the thing was done. "We must now separate," said the old man, who had lately poured forth the bitterness of his heart. in speech, and who, for the better arrangement of our narrative, we shall henceforth designate by his proper name-Marsham, "' we must now separate. Seen together in such a number, our presence will only increase the suspicion that, even lulled as lmuch as possible, we shall have good reason to fear. Yonder "-the speaker pointed in the direction opposite to. London-" doth our track lie. Strangers, farewell! and take with thee a parent's thanks, a parent's blessing." Speaking the last words with very great emotion, Marsham gave his hand singly, to those whom lie addressed, by eaclh of whom its pressure was filly returned. The two parties separated-tie Marshams being the first to leave the ground. But ere they were out of sight of those whom they had left be- hind, they turned several times, on each occasion waving their hands or using other signs of regard.    '; Cade, and those with him watched them until their disappearance behind a woody eminence; then pursued his way towards London. On each side were his fellow-travellers; and all pursued their track, in silence, except the old man, in whose mind late scenes, it so appeared, had opened the flood-gates of memory-a circumstance which his children would fain have prevented. Yet, though the father spoke, his words could not be distinguished. In a low tone were they uttered, and, it seemed at random. However, the in- dulgence did not prevent his going onward at a goodly pace. About an hour after the place set apart for the burial had been left, the day broke. By the grey light which, at first, the skies and the earth were mantled with, the plodders perceived that they were only a short distance from London; whose many spires, pinnacles, and domes, became more dis- tinct as the distance lessened, and the yet unseen sun approached its place of rising. Ere he showed himself, however, the northern outskirts of the metropolis were closely neared by the travellers, and Cade had been left alone. "' As our friend, stranger," said Iubert, speaking to Cade, " must we wish thee farewell. Our business takes us in yon track"-he pointed in the di- rection now occupied by Kentish Town; but which was in the reigns of the Henrys, a succession of fields, having a few cottages strewed here and there -"i thine, I trow, takes thee thither," the speaker turned towards the huge city in the distance. "Farewell! stranger. It is not improbable that the chances of life may throw us together-agaih. "Farewell!" said Cade, addressing the men and women, individually. "Farewell! old man-thou, his elder born-and thou, his younger.. And farewell, thou--and thou. Chance hath this day flung us together. We have-as thou has just said, and said truly-seen more than it is the wont of every day to bring. Many scenes have been presented to us-and motley, indeed, have been their colors. But, farewell, and God speed ye all." So saying, the Insurrectionist parted with his late companions. As Cade neared London, lie could not help his thoughts reverting to the cruel fate of the man in whose burial he had lately assisted. Everything he had wished to become acquainted with in respect to the rescued lbody had been revealed. The Marshams had been for some years much persecuted by an influential party belonging to the church. The reason of this was, that in the hands   THE BONDSMAN's ST'rUGGLE.          75 of these men and their successors there remained much wealth belonging to the Marshams; which-it was not merely whispered, but boldly asserted-- could hyve been openly claimed if a legal formality could have been comnr plied with. This was out of the power of the claimants. The deprivation of wealth caused, of necessity, .the whole family to be much grieved. On none, however, did the wrong fill so heavily as upon tho youngest son. To the chief agent in his house's Imin tl il the tyoung man firequently go, tto urgeI upon his conscience tIe dntty he was un(er to reinstatohe falmily in their wrongly appropriated posesiolon;: and as often was he received with priestly arrogance and tauntings; the latter of which, the mall a)plied to felt secure in lavishing upon Malshall ch All this had been borne for some time, thouh the young man was not possessed of sufficient self-control to hide the symptois of the increasing rage then burning in his bosom. It will be sufficient for the reader to know the result, as bearing on incidents with which he has already been made ao- quainted. Led by his evil genius to the church in which the priest was offi- ciating, and, having been fully employed in brooding over the wrongs inflicted upon himl and his, the young h- an, nble any longer to wurbois temper, went to the altar; taxed the surpliced cheat with his crime; and, being bade by him to be renoved, raised his arm, wich ere it had fallen by his side, had struck the priest prostrate. lhe remainder of young Mnrsham's story is already known. "Whitc-robed robber!" exclaimed Cade, thinking of what we have hur- riedly glanced at-" thou art still alive-still left, to look meekly, to kneel, to pray, and to talk of heaven; whilst thy poor victim is in his grave. ing thou hast affixed a brand to sear those hearts away--not quicky--but by slow degrees." Cade, now hastened to the residence of Leah, where he had determined to rest awhile, and also learn more of his sister's history.  CTHAPTER   XIV. CAnDE soon felt the confinement to Leah's dwelling very irksome; and it was only for the purpose of seeing how far he could lighten his spirits by miing in a more busy scene, and inhaling fresher air, that he left the plaoe in hich his sister was tended, and directed his steps towards Westminster. The time of his departure was morning; and the weather such as to woo many from their retiremenmt. Walking in the direction of Westminster, ere long he reached the Abbey, around which was a dense crowd. "For what are these people gathered together?" asked Cade of a man by - whose side he had stopped. "For what!" exclaimed the man, in imanifest surprise, eyeing the ques- tioner friom top to toe, and then from toe to top, Ilot, however, without expressim g som ething like pity thr -the ignorance implied in the query that had beeni put to him. "WIhy, friend," lie added, in a gentle tone, Cade's halughty glalnce having somewhat cooled him "an ,ble- aiden is going to be married to as noble a young lord. But, that is not all. The ceremonv is to be performed in state; and the king and his court are to attend. When thou hearst the next chimes, thou mayst as well look out for a good place, for I can assure thee, on my verity, that there is likely to be a hard tustle to see ing Henry, the Cardinal Beaufort, and the b)eauteous bride, and galanl;t bridegroomn." "he nuptials of a fair lady with a noble, solemnised in state; the king, here; the Cardinal Beaufort, too-the man who was named as his chiefeet friend , But, I shall know it all when the chimes peal forth. Leot me see. Ten minutes. That is all."     t7           JACK CADE; OR, The above words were spoken by Cade, in great agitation, and on con- eluding the last sentence he looked upwards to the clock belonging to the , abbey. More than three thousand persons-of both sexes, and almost every age- had been awaiting the coming of the procession. The sight of gaily-clothed courtiers and a king, would, in itshf, have been quite sufficient to bring them forth. That they might have a good view of both, they did much;  though their greatest exertion was reserved in favor of the bride and bride- groom. So general, and so superior to all others was the wish of seeing them, that the movement made in the crowd had the inmmediate effect of preventing Cade continuing the glance he had already fixed on the place near which the figure of the man he sought would first appear. However, he soon regained what he had lost; much more, we should say, a little exertion taking him closer to the track over which the procession was moving. At last, the man whom Cade so wished to see was before him; and gaz- ing on his handsome and smiling face, he said:-"God! can it be that it is the same? that the man to whom you fair girl is about to pledge her troth is my sister's destroyer!" Instinctively he grasped his sword, and then hurried onwards, towards the door of the abbey, through which the bridal throng had passed. The inside of the church, at the moment Jack entered, was magnificent in the extreme. The king had taken his seat on a raised platform, over which there hung a canopy of state. Around him were several of his courtiers; the Cardin"Beaufort sitting a little lower down, on the monarch's immedi- ate left. 'Deldle, Catherine, Willoughby, the bride's maids, and others, were at the altar -and- the ceremony had already commenced.     .  For the purpose of catching the name of the bridegroom, Cade listened  with great attention, and breathed many a harsh word on thosnerna4:hhii; whose remarks or jostling movements tended to lessen the possibility of his having his wish gratified.         ". "Of whom, I pray thee, sir, are these the espousals?" asked Cade, deter- mined to make assurance doubly sure. "These espousals are those of the Lord Henry Willoughby and Catherine Delisle, only daughter of the Baron Delisle, who is one of our oldest peers, and just returned to England." For one moment Cade was still-the next saw him violently agitated. Grasping more firmly the sword which, for the last quarter of an hour, he had not relinquished his hold of, he made his way towards the man on whom he meant to inflict summary chastisement. That there might be no delay in so doing, and that vengeance might be accomplished at one blow, he neared the part of the abbey spoken of, and held his yet unsheathed sword so as to facilitate its withdrawal from the scabbard. In less than a minute the two men were side by side. "' This to thy false heart!" exclaimed Cadaas he rushed forward, and con- fronted the seducer of his sister. He would have realised his words had not his ari been held back, and the force of many men wrenched his weapon from his hand. "Secure the sacrilegious wretch." "lown with him." Spare him notl" were a few of the many exclamatiuns that burst from the crowd. They were accompanied by great confansn and the scream of a woman- the BUIDE.

Ilo was about to stretch his limbs upon his bed, when there were presented to hin a few tokens of promised escape, and he assumed a more cheerful state of mind. A ray of sunshine burst through the grating; a breath of air, speaking of the green fields that lay beyond the confines of the circling city, made its way into the room- and a bird, after resting a little time 1upon the bars, winged its course high up into the bosom of the sky. Presently, the prisoner was asleelp-flst, fast asleep. And as he looked then, he appeared, indeed, as one whose life was circled by a charm-as one who, though the -power of a realm was banded against him, could not know the universal doom of his kind, until the coming of that day and after the passing of those events wlich the hand and the voice of a higher Being , --  .h-ad already marked and named.     - CHAPTER XV. Li  ore evil hath coome from that source- that accursed source that, for more than twenty years, hath sent forth waters of bitterness! He is their prisoner. But, he must nc(t die the deathof a felon. Yet, what means must be taken to divert the already sharpened axe frolm his bared  neck? lie hath stepped between the law and its execution-twice hath he done this. And his other deeds; which men call crimnes-they have been the attempt to take away the life of a noble, and sacrilego. Either of these, standing alone, and lacking the wish of inflicting death and torture, would. consign him to the hands of the executioner. As it is-his intended victim being a noble, and the cardinal's nearest of kin-had he ten lives, all would be taken; and the one will be sacrificed, if no attempt is made to force cle- mency from those in power.

What we have iritten formed part of the ruminations of old Leah; who :-had only a short time before heard of Cade's capture and imprisonment. :The suggestion of which she spoke, seemed to give her great pleasure; and it also appeared, from the hurried way in which she called her servant, that she was determined to lose no time. Obedient to the desire of the prophetess, her servant girl stood eflbre her. "I must from home, good Martha," began Leah. "I n mny absence, see that thou lookest well to the house; staying with Grace, nor leaving her for aught that can tempt thee to do so. Stir not, girl-stir not from the side of her I have bidden thee to watch."      "That I will not, mistress," replied the girl. "Nothing shall tempt me to do so." "Good girl," returned the prophetess. "But," she continued, as though suddenly recollecting something, "I shall stand in need of thy assistance before 1 leave the house. Take this key, and go to the press in the next chamber. There-heed me well, girl-thou wilt see a suit i;7 brave look- ing garments, in them," she went on, aside, "I must pay my v-it." TChe change in the. woman's dress was soon accomplished, to ai: almost  total loss of her usual identity. She had been an aged woman, in p(oor garb, and with a bent form. LYow, she was, to all appearance,!;irty years younger, of a goodly presence, and arrayed like any high-bre,' lady of the land. Giving Martha some further instructions, she set out to visit Beaufort, her former betrayer. Leah having reached the cardinal's palace, demanded an instant audience. A retainer hastened to the prelate, and informed ltIm r that a lady visitor requested to be favored with an interview. "A lady desires to see me!" exclaimed the churchman, pettishy: "Ad- mit her to the outer chamlber. I will come to her, immediately." The man departed to admit Leah, and the cardinal was left alone. Beaufort, on entering the apartment into which he had ordered his retainer to usher' Leah, immediately recognized her; and in a tone of harshness, which was accompanied by-great agitation, demanded her business. -"I have come to thee, lord cardinal, in behalf of one who is a prisoner ia ,; the Tower-one John Mortimer; though known to most by another name -that of Cade." "I know whom thou meanest," returned Beaufort, not daring to meet the keen glance of the wronged woman-" one who is about to be adjudged to death, for riot, attempt at murder, and sacrilege. Thinkest thou that I unite in my single person the sole authority of this kingdom?" "Nay, my lord, I do not deem so," answered the prophetess: "I only' know that thoi hast great influence in the councils of the King-that thy word is weighty in matters of state. Wilt thou not use that influence and speak that word in behalf of one who, though an offender against the law, had much temptation to be so?" '"Temptation!' sneered the cardinal- "from whom?" "From thee and thine," answered Leah, more firmly than she had spoken before. "Now; hear me out. Under the disguise of honorable love, Ihenry Willoughby wooed a trusting maiden, for the purpose of triumphing over her. lie did so. But, that was not all. Heart riven, she mourned a few days, and then went mad. Well, lord cardinal, her brother, after years of absence, returned, his heart swelling in proud expectation of soon pressing the beloved pne. His mother's child-dear, dearer to him than life itself, closer to his heart's core than the veins whose warm ourrents did sustain that life-had been betrayed; was miad. He-listen, sir-who had been the cause of this, was on the eve of plighting his vows to a fair damsel, when the brother of Grace-the poor, wronged Grace-beheld him. His act thou knowest-attempted mur-but, no: 'twere a shame so to call it. Anctfor the commission of such an act had he not ample cause? I await thine answer." "Take it; and deem it final," replied Beaufort, vindictively. Were each hair of the head Iof him for whom thou pleadest, a life, none should be spared I were each pore of his flesh to be endowed with a voice, and all were :call, 'mercy! mercy!' he should die."  "Have mercy!" importuned the woman. "That thou must seek elsewhere." "Upon my knees I crave it," Leah continued humbly and imploringly. "Thou wilt soil thy silk, lady," said Beaufort, an expression of fiendlike malice coming over his features. 'The next moment Leah was upright, and confronted the prelate. .1fer   THE BONDSMAN' STRIUGGLE.           79 attitude was one of intense passion; her eyes glared like meteors, and thus 'she cursed the man before her: "Now, may He whose pretended servant thou 'it.-Nwhose name thou usest, and the signet of whose martyrdom thou wenrest--curse thle, every where, and at all times: abroad, at homeo; in the morning, noon, and niight! ray pestilence cling to thy flesh, until it becomes as cocrupt as the tmind that it enshrines; miay thy heart be a sepulcl: e of pat 1 joys and hopes; thy brain, a volcano,L for ever burning, and bu;-ning most fiercely when thou thinkest of the wrongs thou hast committed-the wrongs, robed cardinal, whichl thou could'st have cancelled, but would'st not(!

Not daring, after the first vain essay, to look at-her full in the face, he sat, with his beye ibent upon the grounds. At- tlihe:ommnix e- ment of the curse, his face retai'ed its usual stern anriquiet exprision. This did not continue long4 for, as impreeation was added to imprecation, his aspect suddenly changed:, until the womnan had finished, when the Cardinal's countenance witsr 4 as Death's; his limbs shook; and, he -:unk, exhausted, on the floor.

But, though upon the issue-all of Iife, hope and happiness, were dependent, the Insurrectionist did not quail in the least. It was evening when Chaworth came into the apartment occupied by Cade; to whom, while giving the necessary information, he showed the document, signed and sealed, wherein the order for the prisoner's rDemoval on the morrow was expressed. The officer departed, after -duly executing 1hi. mission. U(ade heard the door of his room relocked, bolted and barrled. Even fastenings, strong as     80            JACK CADE ; OR, those used there, were more than sufficient to prevent all chances of escape. But these were not all. There were many passages to be traversed, before the outside gates could be gained-many passages; all of which were as strongly, if not more strongly secured than the little room appropriated to the Insurrectionist. And he heard these barriers between freedom and himself closed; heard them all shut against him; yet he stood firm and confident of life! The twilight was descending; but it spoke not of the thing to which it is so much akin-the grave. The dull sound of church bells-picturing life's opposite as strongly as did the gloaming-had come upon the air, even to Cade's ear. Still he wavered not; still remained without enter- taining a supposition that his days were numbered.  "A bright sky," remarked Jack, looking upwards, to the grating: ^ a bright and beautiful sky. Yon star-how pure is its lustre, how mildly it seems to be beaming down, on this place of captivity and darkness-this old pile, that would, were its stones vocal, prate loudly of wrongs of which it has been witness. That star-again do I look up to it with something of a lingering love-what, seems it to be breathing? What I. Hope! Where now' is the promise ofthat glorious future which Lacy ever pointed to as the pole-star of my destiny?" Thus Cade thought. In a few moments, the nlames of those he loved were on his lips; and ere they had been uttered many seconds, he was in a state which could not be called sleeping nor waking; but a ,union of each. ,It was not waking; for the man could not so collect himself as to question what seemed a reality, though still a vision, whose voice said: "The rivets are cast; the rope is coiled; and the axe is sharpened ; yet of either shalt thou kno Xv nothing. For the day on which thy Judges have already agreed thou shalt be taken from prison, to resign thy life upon a scaffold, thousands are looking, deeming it a holiday for them. They have counted without their host. They shall not see thee. It has'been ordained otherwise. But thy prison is strong-too much so, to allow thee or a legion like thee, to elude the vigilance of those who hold .watch over the ;" continued the figure. "Thou art but flesh, and mere flesh cannot master bolts, bars and locks. Thou wilt not test the power of such things; neither will they fly back to take thee to freedom. Thy freedom is near thee; yet, though so near, would escape thy notice, was it not that thou art to be directed in what place to seek it. Now, to slumber for a brief time, and when thou wakest, heaven's light will show thee where to look." Suddenly awaking, Jack looked about him, confusedly, and as though he had no recollection of what had passed-no idea that between what he had witnessed and the present, there was anything like a connection. But, some- thing-and a simple thing it was--reminded him of all, as well as caused him to act upon the hint given him by lis unearthly visitant. This was the moon's beam shining full upon a particular panel of the apartment. Now, all flashed back with the force of conviction, depriving Cajle, for a little time at least, of immediate power. And the few moments he remained in this state were terrible ones. He saw the medium of his escape from captivity, death and disgrace, He knew that, once passed the little panel, he should have eluded pursuit, and have but a short way to go, to once more enjoy actual freedom: but he could not stir. No, even his pulse was with- out a beat; and all that did move, we;e the heavy drops of sweat upon his brow and cheek. He essayed to put his limbs in action: they were marble. He tried to utter words: his throat was parched, and he seemed to have no tongue. However, there was soon a change for the better. This helplessness-this worse than childish weakness-was dispelled. Cade was erect, and capable of all necessary action, The first thing he did on regaining possession of his faculties was, to go to the panel. His hand fell, as though by instinct, on a spring which, giving way, disclosed nothing save darkness,   TrllEl ONDSMSAN'6 8TI Ct(,GLF,       81 -The prisoner felt that to hope to make his way, through tceing, would be worse than ridiculous. So placed, he had but to trust to a s:ense differentto that of sight-feeling. Groping with his hands and feet, lie soon came to the conviction that a flight of stone stairs led downwards. How far these went, he did not know, nor did he pause to ask himself the question. Still he went on, making his way in thick darkness. Presently there was a noise different to any his progress had called 'frth. It was the splashing of water; which, from the peculiarity of the sound itself, as well as the dampness of. the walls which bounded Jack's track, he had no doubt rose above his head. There was something awful in that chafing of water-something that, apparently not natural to the motion of the element, spoke of sufferings, death, and the grave. The uses of the place from which the Insurrectionist was departing, were well known to him. What the Tower was appropriated to-what it had been assigned to-Cade did not require to be informed. "Light! light!" exclaimed Cade, exultingly. "Thll fresh air, too!" He felt the latter play upon his brow. He had been hol, through inhaling the humid atmosphere of the place.; and the sudden change was too much for him. He tottered; and would have fallen, had he not firmly clasped the iron bars of the window througlh which he had just ca-ight a glimpse of a little of the world that lay beyond his prison walls. Fortunately for our ihero, chance had led him to enter one of tloseisolated apartments which, being reacied only by under-ground passages from the main building, were but illy secured, perceiving which, Cade applied his gigantic strength, before which the door yielded, and he found himself in the court-yard opening on Tower Hill, his departure from which was unnoted and unobstructed. (Jade now hurried to the dwelling of Leah, which having reached, h1e knocked gently at the door.  J "Who's there?" inquired a voice, which Cade had no difficulty in recog- nising as Leah's. Uttering an exclamation of surprise, she busied herself in opening the door; and, when she had admitted her visitor, threw her arms about his neck. "How hast thou escaped?" was Leah's first inquiry. "I am happy to see thee-yes, very happy. But, how-by what earthly means-hast thou been able to escape the, vigilance of those who were thy keepers? Tell me! tell me!" "I'will," said (Jade. "Before I do so, it will be better that we secure the fastenings of this door." Leah, in her great impatience to hear all that Jade could tell her respect- ing his escape, had, forgetful that the house door was still opened, mounted a few stairs. Being fully convinced that it would be better to do as Jack said, she descended, and gave her assistance in what he required. "Thou lookest ill and ca rn, remarked the Prophetess, as aided by the lamp and the casting aside of the Insurrectionist's dress, she saw more of his face than she had while at the door. "I will bring thee something that will revive thee-some food-some-" "Only a little water, good Leah," said Cade, interrupting his aged friend. "I am only athirst." "Water!" exclaimed the woman, "Nay, thou shalt have something better for thee than that-sonTe wine-here!" She handed a horn of wine to Jack, who took it from her. and swallowed it. "That hlas revived me," lie lremarked. ' Now, to tell thee how 1 am here."  Cade did what his words inmplied--reliting to Leah every particular con- nected with his late escape from the Tower. When he hod concluded, Leah exclaimed' suddenly:-  "We must hence-hence, ere this day's noon." "Hence, -sayest thou?"'. exclaimed Jack. "Whereo-why?"     82            J ACK CADE; OR, "To a place not far distant from London," rejoined Leah; " and if thou- askest me why, I will tell thee. Jnowest thou the Cardinal (whom they lit- 'tle thought was even then a corpse) is aware of our connection with each other. Being so, will he not bid teim search for thee here? Shouldst thou be discovered, all would be lost. Mine own liife I care not for; but there are others to be preserved-thee and poel Grace. Vengeance would not be sated until it had crushed her quite." "Thou advisest well," replied the Insurrectionist. "For thine own sake as well as the sake of my poor Grace, it will be better that we leave this city. Beyond it, we may be secure; continuing in it, every moment of our existence brings with it an apprehension." "'Tis well thou dost approve m5 plans," remarked Leah. "But, ere we begin our journey, thou must have rest. The goodly bow loseth its power when too strongly drawn. Akin is the mind and body of man, when over- wrought. Thou requirest sleep. Thou shalt have it." The speaker took up a lamp for the purpose of lighting her companion to another apartment, in which there was a bed, having done which, the two separated: one to a deep sleep; the other to prepare for thfir departure from London.                     g CHAPTER XVJI.  Ir will be recollected that Gerald had left Cade somewhat abruptly, while the latter was endeavoring to arouse his poor unfortunate sister to a recog- nition of himself.  Gerald felt that the presence of a third person could not fail to be unwel- come, even though he were a warm friend and a deep sympathizer. He therefore left the neighborhood of Leah's residence, resolving to wait upon Cade in the evening, but was prevented doing so. Our readers are aware that soon after this, the bold youth who sought to avenge a sister's wrongs, was a prisoner in the Tower, and in the power of one who was ever ready to sacrifice justice to revenge--the Cardinal hav- ing not only the will but possessing the power, severely to punish the daring arm which was raised against the Lord Willoughby, the only being whom . * his selfish soul could afford to love.  Gerald had no sooner learned this untoward event than he hurried down into Kent, to consult with Lacy and Worthy what means could be adopted to liberate the man who was the very soul of their enterprise, and wtifitf whom no blow could be successfully struck.        H Great was the consternation of the bold spirits in Kent when they heard of the capture of their leader, and some even proposed an immediate advance upon London, and an attack on the grim fortress jvhich enclosed their champion. The cooler judgment of Lacy overruled this proposition, %-and Gerald \was bid to hasten back to the motropolis,'and with noney, which Lacy abundantly'supplied, endeavor to corrupt one of the keepps, that thus Cade might be liberated. . It was on his return to execute this scheme that Gerald encountered Leah, Cade, and the brain-riven GCrace, who were then on their way to Kent. Words would fail to describe the ecstasy of Gorald on beholding his leader once more at liberty; and after having listened with manifest delight to Cado's account of his escape, he unfolded to the Insurrectionist the vast- ness of the organization which Worthy, Straw, and Walter, had been instru- mental in formnig. While Gerald and hris friends ve'ore pursuing their route with a pace neces- sarily slow and tedious, owing to the presence of the two females, matters were fast coming to a criisi among the discontented thralls and bondsmen, who suffered unldeLr the daily oppressin of Lord Say and his steward Court- nay, the latter of whom had recoverled lis health and strength, although he still felt the effects of the blow 1 - lhnkn f: ha(d so justly merited.   THE BONIDSMAN S STRUGGLE.         83 We have said that matters were coming to a crisis that could not long be avoided, and it needed but some special aggression on the part of Say or his minion, to kindle the flame which was slumebering in each bold breast, that now palpitated with thoughts of that heaven-born freedom which Lacy had so eloquently descanted upon. Nor, was the occasion long wanting. It will be recollected that Worthy had an only daughter, a blooming and lovely girl, upon whoem her father doted as the apple of his eye; this maiden had been long betrothed to Walter, Gerald's brother, and it was resolved that as soon as Cade could be liberated and Gerald had returned, no further delay should prevent the wedding taking place, especially as she would be somewhat safer as a wife than as a maid, should anything arise to call her tather and her lover to a distance.  Now, one of the rights which the lords of the soil claimed, was that of bestowing the hands of the maidens born on their manors upon whomsoever they pleased, and refusing their consent to any union to which they might choose to object, which union could not be ratified except on pain of im- prisonment to the contracting parties, and of heavy penance laid by the Clurch upon the priest who should presumne to perform the ceremony. We must here pause to perform a melancholy office for the unfortunate Grace. The journey of Cade had been suddenly interrupted by thefast failing condition of his sister. Despatching Gerald forward, lhe datermiiiied- to - abide by the couch of Grace until her spirit had taken its place on high, there to range itself'on the side of those accusing souls who claim vengeance on their betrayers. At last the hour of her dissolution approached, and feebly calling her bro- ther and Leah to her side, she embraced them both, and then sinking into a placid sleep, her spirit passed sweetly away from this troubled world. fHer brother having paid the last token of respect to his dear sister, and deposited her remains in the bosom of her mother earth, nothing now remained for him but to devote all his energies to the one great cause in which he was enlisted. Iaving provided for Leah's return to London, lhe himself hurried with all possible speed to Kent, which, strange to say, lie reached on the same day on which his beloved Mariamne and child landed on its coast. This most happy reunion was hailed as a bright omen for the future, and the hearts of both husband and wife beat high with anticipations; nor could the aged and grief-stricken parent behold the happiness of her chil- dren without, in a measure participating in it, albeit, her heart Was sorely grieved at the recent unhappy fate of that daughter she had so dearly loved  and so fondly cherished. '  But, brief space was Cade allowed to spend in sweet converse with his devoted wife, from wom he had been so long separated. The claims of those, whom he had sworn to lead to deeds of high achievement were to be  preferred above- those of individual gratification, and hastily, flding hI wife and child to his bosom, he departed under the escort-of Lacy, Worthy, and Gerald, for the--cave, whereowcroe assembled the imlpticent thousands who longed to fight under the banner of that leader, wose-poteit armi Lacy, -mingling superstition with truthlhad --suicd them, could alon - redress their wrongs, and win for them. that CihARTER oP RiGHTS which is a 'freeman's inherent'pti; . .rvi                    ..

And so I welcome him. Stranger, thy hand." Cade readily assented to his accostor's reqlaest; "Happiness and life's prosperity bindethi not man to man as doth misery and wrong," was the remark of another, somewhat less aged than the pre- vious speaker, and one who had more grace about him. - "The down pi-  lowed and silken-sheeted may claim affinity with each other; but, neverthe- less, they know no friendship like that wlhich hath a lodging in our hearts. Even the wedded loves that cleave together have an end; but, while the currents of life are warm in our veins, we. will never desert those who are companioned with us in a great cause. Accept thou my welcome, as well as that of my associates." "And mine, and mine, and all," were the words that rung throughout the place.. And before they had quite died away, Cade was the centre figure of a huge band of new friends. CHAPTER XVIII. ALTHOUGH known to his followers as Cade or Mortimer, it had been. deemed politic by Lacy, that our hero should retain his Italian name of Aylmere to all others. It was this change of name added to his bronzed features and stalwart form, that prevented the creatures of Say from dis- covering in the stranger the stripling who had once headed the bold attack, which had been the first open resistance to that authority which had so long been dleemedl unassailable. Altlough Courtnay watched with lynx-eyed keenness, for some clue to enable him to fathom the mystery which he felt, rather than knew, was sur- rounding him, his utmost efforts were unavailing, except in one particular. lHe learned, that on a certain day, Kate Worthy was to be given in marriage to Walter, and that the Friar Lacy was to perform the ceremony. This in- tention he determined to thwart, not so much out of respect for the invaded privileges of his lord, as to gratify his own animosity against Lacy and Worthy. It happened that Cade having been obliged to be much absent firom home, lis wife was left to her own resources for amusement, and one of her prin- cipal pleasures was derived from strolling in the forest paths, which sur- rounded the cottage in which she dwelt. On one of these occasions, the lovely Marianmle had been met by Lord Clifford, who was then on a visit to his cousin Say. Startled at beholding so much beauty and refinement, where he had hitherto enco, utered none but' rustic hoydens, the Duke stammered forth some idle compliment, and volun- teered his escort. This, the lady declined, but Clifford most discourteously persisted, and accompanying her to the cottage,. thus discovered the place of her abode. Enquiring of Courtnay the name and condition of the strange lady, the -duke learned that she was the wife of Aylmere and the mother of his infant daughter. One would have supposed that here was information which might have served to curb his unruly desires, but far from it, it seemed rather to add to his determination to possess the lovely being, for whom he had conceived a most unholy passion, and instead of treating her with that respect and deference her position claimed, he racked his busy brain to com- pass her ruin. The day had now arrived for which young Walter had so earnestly longed; 4* r   THE BONDSMAN 8 STRUjBTGO.  -= I'  ;! -           =1 Cade challenging Lord Say on Tower Iill. the day Qn which he was to wed the lovely Kate; and all preparations, save one, had been made--the omitted one was that of asking leave of Lord Say to solemnize the nuptials. This, her father would not consent to, claimin that he was neither bondsman nor thrall, but a yeoman, and as such would wed his bonny Kate to whomsoever he listed. The more immediate relatives and friends being assembled, among the lat- ter of whom were Cade and his mother, besides a number of those who had banded together in Freedom's cause; 'the good Friar was about to proceed with the ceremony, when Courtnay rushed suddenly into the apartment, and commanded them to desist, at the same time endeavoring to lay hands upon the maiden. No sooner had his polluting touch been felt by the affrighted bride, than uttering a piercing shriek, she rushed to her father's arms for pro- tection; but-the miscreant Steward, emboldened by the presenee of some of the pampered varlets who had accompanied him, attempted even to drag her thence, which so enraged the indignant father, that with one blow of the hanger, which never left his side, he struck the caitiff dead at his feet. Here then was an opportunity for contrasting the high moral courage which dwelt in the bosom of our hero, with that counterfeit which for a time had animated the breasts of his followers. These men, but now, so loud and boasting, and who even murmured at the judicious. delays which Oade interposed to their unruly desires, no 6iS^^^^' , is'^y                     ^     10     -   -   JACK CADE; O , sooner beheld the vile current flowing from the cloven head of -their tyrant, .than their craven hearts sunk within them, and right willingly would each have shmk to his cottage, as the whipped hound does to his kennel. But Lacy instantly saw how fatal to their cause would be the least exhi- bition of pusillanimity, and seizing the bloody weapon wherewith Worthy had struck the bold blow, he raised it aloft, and thus addressed the panic- stricken wretches, who, had it not been for the efforts of Gerald and his brother, would ere then lhavo fled from the spot.  "Friends and Freemen:--From this tinme forth our cause is onward; for there is nought behind, save chains and bondage. Think you, yonder caitiff's master will tamely brook the blow that robs oppression of its vile -minister, and thus proclaims the knowledge of our right to freedom ? What boots it that in flight you find escape from present wrath; are ye the das- tard knaves would leave your wives and little ones to bravo the savage ire of one who knows no mercy, save that the tiger knows ? Look on this reeking weapon, and as ye see the miscreant's blood drip from the avenging steel, say, who among you would not strike a blow in such a cause ?" Those few words uttered by Lacy with all that fervor which marked his- harangues, produced an instantaneous effect, and loud were the cries of, Cade! Cade! Mortimer! Mortiner!" Thus invoked, our hero, looking proudly on the men, who had at length dared to raise their voices in tumultuous shouts, addressed to them a few words of advice and encouragement, promising that- on the instant of the arrival of some necessary equipments which were hourly expetetd, he vwould no longer delay, but march them at once to London's 1proutd city, and there, thundering a nation's wrongs in the ears of their pnppet king, extort from him that Charter which should make them free as the air they breathed. In the meanwhile, he urged upon Worthy the necessity of concealing him- self in the cave, where, with the assistance of Straw, Gerald, and theo other subordinate leaders, he might use the time profitably, in teaching to their men some of those tastics which tend more than numlberg. to the successful issue of any conflict. The Widow Cade and her son now set out on their return to thile cottage, where Mariamne had been left in the pleasing task of attending t,, the wants and amusement ofher beloved daughter. Soothed by the gentle cares of her devoted mother, the child had fallen asleep, and was tenderly laid ulpon the humble pallet which the unhappy Grace had so often presscd. Left to her own thoughts, the anxious and loving wife could not fail to dwell with absorbing intent upon the path which destiny seemed to have marked out for her husband. Earnestly did she pray for the blessing of Pro- videnee upon that cause--the sacred cause of Liberty-which she had ever been taught to regard as the possession priceless beyond all others. AbsOrbed in deep thought, she heeded not a darkening shadow which fell across the floor of the chamber in which she eat, nor knew that her fond aspirations for the preservation of her lord were breathed to other ears, until tartled by a jewelled hand being laid lightly upon her shoulder, while a voice modulated to the softest key, thus broke upon her solitude:- "Prithee, lady, why so sad? whither strays thy truant lord, who thus neglects those ruby lips, which were they mine should utter sweeter sounds than ere were learned from shaven priest 1' It was a moment or two ere the startled wife could sufficientlycolleet her senses to reply to the bold address of this popinjay intruder; at leingth, sum- moning to her aid that look which charmtterizes Italia's highborn daugh- ters, she indignantly replied:- "Begone, base lord, nor sully with your presence the home of one who ne'er did wrong to thee, nor over shamed his manhood by, a crime could match this thief-like treachery." "Pardon, lady mine, if thus unbid I come to proess the suit thy churlish lord might sOk to mar. Did'st feel the fire thine oeyos hath kindled in my    'w- 'E i OD MAN: N TRG L,         8 soul, thou nc'er wouldst chide my wish to queneh thlame. nl1 as for leaving tee, h bytlhis fair hand I swear to tarlly at tl et, til ery shaime dost bid me rise, and .ioldest lty Douing lips to lelo ille upf." Saying this, the bold Ohoird, for .he it wa. s wh-o had thus iitluded on the lady' pisss rihinself of her hd, ald il stlrgling to plrevent 1him, Maria"mne was obliged to rise fi'oi the seat which she hla hitherto retained.

Duing. this brief s anc the abject retch, who had so wantonly outraged an nnprot(,!cOd woroain, trembled like the ve'icst colard, and hesitated not to unite his cl, :'clrties wit h those o' her hle had so basely wronged, for par- don fr'om the ttn e hlad thus sought to injure.

Soothed somewhat by the gentltle leadiin' of Mariallnne, who besought him to preserve his soul free from the stain of blood, C7adl turned to the pitiful coIard, and bid- ding him take heed that he crossed not his path again, spurned him'like a dog from that door he had so recently entered, flushed with the expectation of a base triumph oveora d efenceless  w oman a Icaving learined friom Mariarno the particulars of' Clifftrd's intrusion, and calmed her agitated feelings, it was then the painfiul task of nade to inform his wife of the tragic evenlt of tlat day, and also of his deto rmination t march directly up)on London, laving fist chastised Say for all the eruelties he had lpractised upon his mislable bondsmnen, and above all, for the mur- der of his noble father. The parting of the mother and son was scarce less paifid'than that of the husband nnd wife, and it was only by enlarging upon the nobleness of the cause in which he was embarked, that our hero could at all pacify those fold objects of his love. Bestowing a fervent em- brace upon his wife, mother and child, Dade instantly set out for the cave, in order to avoid the contemplation of those tears which not only pained but unmanned him. Arriving at the rendezvous without observation or hinderance, our hero was gratified to find that the muster-roll of his ad- herents had swelled to upwards of twenty thousand, all of whom  were secreted in different parts of the country, and awaiting but the signal to concentrate upon some designated point. Raging like a baffled tiger; did the crest-fallen duke hasten to the ca:stle there to tell of the rough handling he had met with, and to seek vengecance upon the man who hld darMd to raise his ignoble arm against one in whose veins circulated tho blood of a hundr ed diffords. Erle le haed gained his jom-noy's end, the duke wisq p)rovided with more food whlerewith to feed his appetite for vengeance, for awhile po 'ering .upon the means best calculited to place the stranger's wife within ais, power, he came suddenly upon a party of men who were conveying the corpse of the murdered Steward to ;hat home which had so oft protected him I firom the just vengeance of his malf-maddened viotimsr. Interrogating the rten ats to the manner in which aourtnay met his death, C lifford soon learned enough to lead him to infer hat the temtpest which had been so long brewing was about to burst over heir   . Hastily entering the castle, the duke sought 'tle presence o' le consin, nnd quiekly made him acqqainted with the recent events. S'ny thou h brave Oa a lion, lacked that coolnems which is so essential  ;     JACK CADE; OR,  an emergency. Ioe raved and stormed at the audacity of the vile serfs d thralls in prosuming to celebrate a wedding without hit permission, or aring to resist unto death the authority he had elegated to his base nion, and resolved upon instant and ample vengeance against the per- otrators of the foul murder, as he was pleased to ternm it. It was only when assured by his cousin Clifford tathata rising was contem- lated, and that he had every reason to suppose a systematic organiation ad for some time been progressing, that he could be brought to view the latter in any serious light. Laughing at the idea of anything to be feared from a band of unarmed non without a leader, it was then he first heard of the presence of yhlmere, and was reminded by his cousin of the renown which somebody earing that name had acquired in the wars of freedom in Italy. Coupling several recent circumstances together, Say at length began to ear that there was more truth in Clifford's surmises than he had supposed, md as a first step he resolved to smo-ke out the rebels" as he brutally termed the-directions he gave for setting fire to. the Widow Cade's cottage, in the dark hour of the night. Having issued this fiendish order, S'y next despatched couriers'to the neighboring nobles to apprise them of the contemplated rising among his vassils, and also wrote a hasty despatch to the government, informing them that unless he received instant assistance he should, in all probability, be bo- sieged within the walls of his own fortress. Say, in reality, did not think that he should requir troops for hs own defence, ut was anxios to overawe the rebels, as he termed them, by a display of great military resources. We shall see in the sequel, that not only he did require them, but that they even were not sufficient to protect him from the just vengeance of those who for so long a time had suffered under the grinding tyranny of his despotic will. OHAPTER XIX.  Tun black veil of night had shrouded every surrduuding object in dark- ness, when issuing from the postern which we have before alluded to as opening into the Home Grove, might have been seen-a party of some dozen of lifford's most brutal retainers, headed by one who, though wearing the air and garb of nobility, was about to engage in a maost treaherous and unmanly act. Can our readers guess the expedition on which these valiant men and this highborn noble, who claimed royalty of descent, were thus so stealthily creeping I Truly, was it one worthy of these dastard menials of a traitor lord. Fit instruments were they to apply the torch to the lone cottage of the widowed and grey-haired woman, who had provoked a tyrant's wrath, by giving shelter to one whose noble wife had dared repulse the base assault which her husband's manly arm had visited with most righteous chasti- ment. Cautiously and noiselessly did this midnight band move through the dark forest, the deep shadows of which caused their craven hearts to sink within their coward breasts, and it needed all the persuasion of their leader and the no less stimulating usquebaugh, to prevent them from leaving this noble lord to act the incendiary in his own proper person.- Clifford had eagerly volunteered on this bloodless expedition, hoping, that in the confusion and terror of the moment, the wife of Aylmore, might per- chance fall into his power. * * * Return we now to the widow's cottage. Mariamne, having embraced her husband, as she supposed for the last time for many days, hadl retired to her apartment, and kissing her sleeping child, knelt down by the humble bed and prayed fervently' for a blessing on the head of him who was so dear to her, and to the cause in which he was em- barked.   THE BONDSMAN'S STRUGGLE.          89 Rising from her suppliant position, Mariaune lingered at the chamber window, speculating with wonder upon the uses of those bright gems which now began to deck the expanse of Nature's firmament. Already had her imagination fixed upon a bright star as the one which hovered over the loved home of her childhood, and while dwelling with pleased anticipations of the future, she became sensible of some moving objects in the distance. Quickly obscuring the light, which flickered in the sconce, Mariamne strained her eager eyes to pierce the deep gloom which the stars did but faintly illumine. That there were men prowling round the cottage, she was now fully convinced; and breathing a prayer for the presence of her hus- band, she eagerly snatched her child from its calm slumber, and enveloping it in some covering hastily taken from off the couch, the alarmed and agi- tated mother sought the room of the widow Cade, who was calmly dream- ing of her youthful days, when first she listened to the vows of her lately murdered husband. Awaking with-a sudden start, produced by the abrupt entrance of her daughter, the widow eagerly demanded what now danger threatened them, what D ew calamity awaited them. Mariamne briefly ielated what she had seen, and urged the widow instantly to fly with her to the Cave. But her entreaties were of no avail; the-widow clung to her home with all that tenacity which marks incipient dotage, and resolved to tarry under her own rooftree regardless of all dan- ger that might befall her there. Meanwhile, the miscreant emissaries of Say,l who were alike regardless of life or property, applied the blazing torch to the most exposed portions of the woodwork, and in a few minutes a lurid light ascended to the heavens, telling of a deed which none but coward hands were base enough  to act. Finding that it was worse than folly to endanger her own life, and that of her child, in vain efforts at persuasion, Mariamne, at length reluctantly sought the entrance to the concealed passage, which would conduct her by an unknown path to the Cave; but even then she could not proceed, and gently placing the yet sleeping child upon the ground, hastened back to make one effort-more to induce her mother to accompany her. Already had she approached within a few rods of the burning cottage, when her ears were assailed by the most piercing shrieks, and her sight was horrified by beholding a party of ruffians hurling back into the flames that aged form which too late had sought escape from a death so horrible. Although her blood was wellnigh frozen in her veins, she was urged by every consideration to seek instant concealment, for too well she recognized the excited and angry tones with which Clifford was ordering the men to disperse in every direction in search of one whom he declared could not be far off, and for whose capture he promised a reward of fifty rose-notes. Half-dead with cold, the fear-stricken mother convulsively clutched her child, as it' to shield it from the murderous wretches, whose hoarse voices she plainly heard ringing in the forest, as each hallooed to the other the vain result of his search.                  f, After many wrong turnings had been taken and manyy vain stcps'had added to her fatigue, the half-frenzicd fugitive at length beheld the glimmer- ing of a torch, which told oi succor near, and summoning all her remaining energies for one last efflrt, she at length reached the entrance to the Cave, and fell fainting in the arms of her astounded husband, who was keeping watch while his truslty followers slept. Passionate and cager were the questions which were asked and answered  as soon as his beloved, wife had been restored to consciousness, and terriblo wa  the hief of the warrior when the horrid death of his mother was mado known to him. Struggling in the grasp of tho strong hands whom the sudden oomlmotion had aroused, Cade would have instantly set forth in search of the hell,     90           ,JAC- ('A )AM4 Oj , hounds who had done .o damning a dood. Nor could all their opposition serve to change his purpo se, till remlinded by Lacy of the poor revenge he would reap, by sacrificing to the mnanes of his murdered mother the lives of a few slaves who but did their nmaster's bidding. This consideration .iduced the excited leader i ta ritn till the return of those wlho had been despatched to convey hither the promised aid from Richard; irieawhile. it was decided that imessengers should be sout off to thie various bands, biddlingt the llnuster otn IBlkllheath, at midnight of the fourth d(:ay hlence, and, concealing thelmselve; within a stupendous cave, which had sonmic years lbeire been created by an earthruake, there await the l'rival of Cade writh the main body of the Kentish men. Cade now eagerly deimandlled if there 'was no secure retreat in which heo could place his beloved wife and child, for they mIlst not be exposed to the danger and fatigue of the coming march. After some reflection, Straw directed him to a grutit whch lhad be en tho scene of many a Druidical rite, and which was considered by tho supersti- tious peasants to be haunted, and wart tlhcrl'o e most carefully avoided. The first dawn of early day vas beginrnitlg to tinge the eastern horizon as Oade, tenderly supporting the teoble steps ot' his wearied Mariamruno set out from the Gave in search of that sacred grotto, which gave promise of a tem- porary sanctuary from the dangers with whichi they were surrounded. Fond and frequent were the embraces with which I   sought to beguile the weary way, and many a soothing word-aftg-4 e counsel had been uttered, when they were alarmled by a shrill whistle suddenly sounding immediately  fii their rear. -Qide enaeavoroedto peer through the dim haze of the grey morning lii t ;  -:r. -i;Aseao i' whence the sound proceeded. But that portion of the forest in  wlriimc oy now were, was too thickly planted to enable him' to 'ascertain whether it was a warning from some, of his own people to apprise hina-f danger, or a concerted signal of some'of thiose base wretches who-weare yet couting the forest in the hope of beating up the retreat of hier for whose capture the vile Clifford had offered so large a reward.  In this state of uncertainty our hero had nro alternative bVut to press tor- wardn to the promised retreat, and there awaithe issuie li! ncumbered as hie was with the only- two beings the bloid-:tidsty mil: hlad yet left him to love, it would ha1e been worse than nmadness to do anrything which might jeopardize their safety.          '  Difficult was it for O-ade -tokcep dd1on the s-urging passions whilch orv and anon would prompt him to face boldly round, .and with his good sword hew a path back to the cave, where so imany- brave hearts and hands awaited but his signal to exterminate with fire and sword that nest of tyranny, in which nought but oppressions'and cruelties had for years been hatched.  But calling to mind the advice of Lucy he resolved to bend for the present to the force of circumstances, solacing himself With thio thought that ore long the tide of affairs would be clhanged and: that instead of the hunted thing he now was, he should emerge from the retreat in which he now sought safety, not alone as a free man, but-as the undisputed leader of a mighty host, before whose conquering arms their base tyrants should fly as chaff before the wind; and in whose assembled names he should demand from the trembling nobles that Charter for the CoMmoNs or ENGLAND, which should ever remain as a monument of the successful istue of "TE M BONDSMAN'S STiUOGoLE."

CHAPTERJ XX. THE confederates of Cade who I we mentioned as having set out in order to possess themselves o the aid promised by Richard, returned to the Cave soon after thi departure of their leader for the Grotto, and all being       92            JACK C'ADE; olt, now ready to march on the promised expedition, many after waiting a few  hours began to chafe at what they termed the unnecessary delay of their  leader. As the time wore away, these clamors began to assume a louder and m e determined tone, and it needed all the persuasive language of Lacy and t united influence of his friends, to prevent these turbulent spirits from elect- ing another chief, and at once proceeding to batter down the gates of Lon- don city, as they vauntingly threatened to do. Lacy now decided that a strong body of the insurgents should be des- patched to relieve Cade from that dilemma into which his keen judgment had long since told him our hero had fallen, but from which he had hoped he-would have been able to extricate himself. Bidding Gerald to take with him a supply of provisions-Cade's need of which only now occurred to him-and a party sufficiently numerous to overcome any opposition from the adherents of Say, he himself sot forth to secure and distribute the aid furnished them by their liberal but deeply self-intercsted ally, Richard of York.      '  We must now return to our hero, whom we left just as he had set out on his perilous adventure, in search of food foi his wife and child Nerved almost to desperation by the recollection of -ll the wrongs he had suffered, and was still suffering, he clutched with n]vous grasp that sword which was his truest friend, resolving to purchaserLwith its jewelled hilt or tem- pered point-that bread, which though oncerohowered from heaven was now denied by man.            t Fortunately he made his exit from the grttto at the moment most favor- able to his purpose, for the men who were then n duty were busily employed in discussing the evening meal, and consequely less on the alert. Gliding cautiously from tree to tree, and from rock to ock, till at length he gained a sufficient distance to feel more secure, he vas urging his course somewhat rapidly in the direction of the Cave, when his ears were startled by the sudden halloo of some one who seemed to have lost his way. Obeying the first impulse, that of flight, Cade paid little attention to the shouts of the wanderer, but hastened forwards on his errand; but it so hap- pened that his very eagerness defeated his object, for taking a wrong turn- ing, he found after walking as long as would have sufficed to reach the Cave, he not only had not arrived there, but was in a part of the forest which he did not recollect having ever traversed before. Maddened, bewildered, and himself suffering from fatigue and hunger, it was now that he regretted not having answered the shouts of the wayfarer, who might have proved of mutual assistance. It was while indulging in re-  gret for what-he now considered heartlessness on his part, that he again heard the faint halloo of the bewildered one. Ca0do immediately replied by a similar shout, and hurrying in the direction from which the voice seemed to come, he was speedily in the neighborhood of the Tman, iwho, like him- self, had lost his way;-but here the similarity stopped. The form which now stood revealed to the glaring eye-balls of the excited Insurrectionist, was one whose presence called up the most fearful recollec- tions. Dim visions of the past seemed to flit through the brain of our half- maddened hero, presenting to his fevered fancy the chiding spirits of a mur- dered father and an outraged and maniac sister, while the blackened corpse of his grey-haired mother, so ruthlessly hurled into the consuming flames seemed to stalk side by side with the gaunt forms of his famished wife and child. So palpable did the vision sern, that the wretched man, uttering a fearful shriek, rushed forward as if to fold in one last embrace the forms of those so dear to him, and finding that his outstretched arms erlooIlunterd nOUght but thin air, he tnuned wildly to himn who had been lming strangely on this fearful scene, and seizing him with herculean gr a shook his trembling frame until the very bones seemed to rattle oi thl powerful hauds of his adversary, for such he now felt him to be.     .   T'IIE JU1ODSMAN S S['RUGGLE.         98 Lord Say, for he it was whose ill-luck had thus cast him in the path of his sworn enemy, had never seen Aylmero, nor even if he had, would he have recognized in him the stripling Cade, upon whom he had heaped up such a fearful amount of cruelty. It was, therefore, with the most appalling fear that he deemed himself in the power of some wild denizen of the forest, whose tightening grasp upon his throat convinced him he had but little respect for gentle blood. Struggling in the powerful grasp, which seemed to confine him as easily as a child would restrain the movements of a puppet,  the craven noble begged piteously for mercy, promlising gold without stint, would he but restore him to the companionship of his friends and vassals from whom he had got separated while in pursuit of game. "Base and cruel lord, seek not to telnpt me with your accursed gold, for I will none on't. 'Tis thy heart's blood I seek; that alone can lay the spirits of those murdered forms that now hover round your guilty head, shrieking for vengeance on their executioner." Tightening his grasp with each word, the a, ging son shortened his sword until bringing it, like a dagger, close to the heart of his victim, he prepared to offer him as a sacrifice to the memory of thos e he ad so basely wronged. Making an almost superhuman' effort, the affrighted lord succeeded in gasping out: "Thoul base-born kerne, art fitly made to do a coward's deed, hadst thou one drop of gentle blood 'twould crimson in thy check to slay an unarmed foe." "Ailms! what'ca-e I for arms? my cause is just, and therefore sure.. False lord, thou liest, in that thou callest me base, for blood as noble courses in these veins as that which soon will dye the turf on which doth stand thy guilty frnim. IDid'st ever hear of one call;d- Cade-Oh! thou tremblest, dost thou? Methinks his bload can claim as rich a tint as that which pales now in thy blanching cheek. Dost like the name, my lord; or like you that which late he hath assumed to lead a nation forth to battle for its rights? 'Tis a name, sweet, gentle, and harmonious, must sound like music to thy ears when whispered in the forest depths, beyond the ken of those who do thy coward will. Would'st hear it, most noble sir?-well, thou shalt be pleasured, as in sooth, it is thy right, for thou hast earned of Cade, a boon shall send thy coward soul to revel in that deepest hell, where spirits such as thine find meet associates. This instant shalt thou die, and as thy dastard soul sinks to perdition's dark abyss, may mocking devils shriek into thine  ears the never-ending curses of all those Cades thy bloody hands have slain." Cnsting lii sword-from him, and turning up his sleeves so as to leave his hands free and unencumbered, Cade was preparing to grapple in a final struggle with the man whose death he had determined on, when he was sud- denly surrounded by a party of Say's vassals, whvlo had been scouring the forest in search of their missing lord. Having securely bound their prisoner, they wo(-rr marclhing him oil to the castle, wihen lie suddenly burst from those .who held him, alid casting him- self at the feet of their lord, besought him to have mercy at least upon his wife and child, who were starving in. a cave near by. In vain lie begged and pleaded for a morsel of bread wherewith to sustain the lives of those so dear to him, for the tyrant, gloating over the agony of this strong man, who now wept as a child, spurned him brutally -with lis foot, bidding hil retainers away with him instantly to the dungeon,. At this instant the party was increased by the arrival of Clifford, at the head of a body of men, having in their centre the sorrowing mother, whose first greeting ior her captured husband, was thio melancholy tidingsl of the death of their child, who had been literally starved to death. Words would fail to describe the. conflicting emotions which agitlted tho breasts of these two captives; the one in the power of his bitterePt foe, and the other the object of the foul desires of a man who spared no pails, nor scrupled at any moans to accomplish hs base purpofss.     "            ; s  h ; OR,  -difford tarried not with his prize, but hurrind rapidly away to the castle, bearing his captive with him, while Say and his party found their prlisone too great a clog on their moveoment, to procead with equal rapility. Say felt considerably elated at the success which had crowned the efforts of his cousin, and did not neglect so good an occasion to vent his malice on his prisoner, Incerating his agonized bosom by coljuring ulp ; most ]hateful pictupes of the llte which awaited his Mariamne at the hand: " hor abdMc- tor. The party had now reached within a short distance. of th1e c.;lle, and were emerging from the outskirts of the forest into the op)cn :' ,nid, when they 'oundrl tlemselves contfronted by a strong body of menl ;.ost advanta- geouosly po sted, who seemed determined to dispute the pa.'s: o e with themorn. Oh I how the heart of our hero bounded within ilm, as he beheld the brave (ile rald(1 at til head of a band of chosen spirits. propared at all points' for his rescue. No sooner had Say become aware of the presence: cof an enemy, and scan- ned his position and numbers, than he saw'th danlger of risking a conflict with mfen their superiors in both. lie, therefore, gave instant orders to put their prisoner to death, anl then to seek safety each for himself, as best he might, It course which as regarded hilnself he instantly adopted. Ere his brutal commands could be obeyed, Gerald had rushed to the side of his leader, and severingr with his dagger the cords which bound him, placed a sword in his hands, with which the rescued lhero quickly heowed a path to the rhead of that band who had so nobly delivered himl from the power of the tyrant. "' On, on, to castle Say," was the impetuous order of the agonized Cade, a3 his mind instantly filled with fears for the safety of his wife, whose death ho dreaded less than her dishonor. Desvpatohing Gerald back to the Cave, with orders to the whole body there Mssembled to rendezvous irmmediately at Sevenoke, a position well calcu- latle for making t stand, should an attack be made by any of those troops wnhom Gerald informed him had arrived in the neighborhood at the urgent sunmmons of Lord Say, Cade marshalled his men to the attack of 'the for- tross within 'vhose frowning walls his wife was a prisoner. Whilst tius enga:ged, he received intelligence that Sir Humphrey Stafford, at the hetld of tL powerful army, was on his, Inirch to give him battle. Up banners, and awav f6r Seveloke," was the cheering response to this intelligence, for C'ade felt s)lre of defeating this carpet knight, and none knew better than lhe, the immense, value of a successful termination to the first conflict with the enemy. Skillfully drawn up and well posted were the insurgents when Sir Humphrey reached the neighborho(,d of Sevonoke, and instead of fleeing at the sight of the king' troops, as he had fondly imnagined, thus yielding him a bloodless victory, he found that he had to deal with a leader possessing more. talent than himself, and at the head of nmen who fouglt not for pay but for freedbmn--that sacred cause ywhich hzad banded thoem togethor as one man, to live or die in its behalf. Making the best disposition he could of his troops, and encouraging them with loud words and braggart promises of the speedy annihilation of the vile scum  to which they were opposed, Stafford awaited, with strong doubts of the result, the onset of his foe. Nor did he ha ve long to tarry, for ade, briefly addressing his nmen, and reminding themi of the sacredness of the cause il which they had taken up &mS, closed his brief harangue wVFith these stirring words,-' odess of Liberty is prched on our banners, see that we drive her not thence, but make her a home in tie hearts of our people, Ifor Freedom no'cr came too soon for wrongs like ours I' '* Glving the signal to sound the chai'ge, Oade dashed impetuously forward * Mr. Forrest, n his rmach admirad character of Oade.

Learning that Say and Clifford who had fon llht in Staffold's armyly, had fled to London, our hero lhad les s appl;-.hemnsion tor the ilmmediate salety o' his wife, and determined to dispatch Lacy, -withl a sufficient force, to storm. the castle, whilst he himnself proceeded by forced marches to join the great body of insurgents, to whom lie 1,.ad previously sent orders to rendezvous on Blackheath, CHAPTER XXI. THr Insurgents weere nusteredl pon Blackheath, at the midnight hour. The sky was cloudless, moonlit, and of a deep blue, studded by a few stars; for the extreme brilliancy of the moon caused but few of heaven's fires to be seen. All was still save the clank of the men's warlike instruments. This was presently hushed, to be followed by the speaking of words which had, to judge from the manifestations of thoseto whom they were address- ed, groat influence over them. The words were Cade's. And thus he appealed to his followers:-  Com rades, we are about to go forth, led by no vain wish for' change, no idle taspiration after revenge. We have wrongs to redress, cruelties and op- pressions to bring to a speedy end. We have availed ourselves of the last just resort of those whom-the purfied ones of power would tread upon, yea, crush into very dust. Often have we prayed and petitioned. What has been our answer? A pointing to the gallows, a rattling of chains, and a threatened death by the faggot. "Accursed tyrants are those who oppress us. They think not of the strength that dwelleth in the arm and heart of the wronged-how the tor- tured victim may, though coining from the dungeon, soon change into tho soldier of freedom. "omrades, we have come forth in au array of strength: and we amo about to march upon the city in whbh our oppressors are dwelling. 1By them we shall be opposed; tierefore, these weapons. But, for the honor of the cause we have espouseduse nhbt violence to any save our foes. Re- member, that as thou art ftim in batte, so be ye gentlein peace. God, lead thou. us, directing our evi-thught, grospering our every act! To thee, and thee alone, must we trust itrselves aid cause. Now, comrades, onl" When the men heard the woirdi"On," thoe set up i volley of shouts that seemed to shake the very ground on which they stood. When they had concluded this demonstration, Jade repeated the order ; and, in this instance, was promptly obeyed. Having reached the city with but little impediment, and stormed the massive gates under a heavy diis:harge of arquebusses, matchlocks, and sone few pieces of cannon, the insurgents effected an entrance, and then found themselves opposed to a numeirus body of troops at the head of whom rode a King's herald, who demanded in the name of his sovereign why and for what purpose his hitherto loyal subjects had thus dared invade the good city of London. To this demand Cade replied'that the Commons of England, deserted by those who should have been their protectors, had tMakn up arms in their own defence, nor would they lay them down until they received from thq king a Charter of Liberties, signed with his own band, and guaranteed to ther by the broad seal of the realm. Should this be granted, they would instantly disband, and return cclh rma n to l:is hom e, blt in the mucenwhilo they demanded the head of the traitor' Say, the treasurer of Kent, together with that of Lord Willoughby the bastfu'd s'on of th;o l!te Cardinal. Gr nting     96            vAOxK CADE; OR, but five minutes for a compliance with these latter demands, Cad represed * the impetuosity of his followers till that period had elapsed. No soonelr had ting five minutes expired, than the two bodies of .n n rushed pon each  er with a forc that seemed as thogh it was cfpble  of destro both. Weapon clashed against weapon, banners were torn from tl lhialds of those to whom they had been entrusted, and arrow  zi1 through the air, doing the intent of tose who ha d shot them aro efficiently as they could have wished. ,     had shot them as Cade was not aware of the presnce of Willoughby, though the latter  had discovered, at a glance the brother of poor Gr face, and something seem-  ed to whisper him that he would be matched against Cadee In the agitation of his feelings consequent upon thuis thought, WFil-  loughby had suffered h-is visor to remain unclosed. "Behold yon miscreant!, exclaimed Jack, as the features of his enemy  t were disclosed to him. In a few seconds, the two men were confronted,  . face to face, hand to hand. There were many fierce contests in the 'trcet, bib nlone of them came ip  to that which took place between Willoughby and C(ade. Fiends could not  have glanced deadlier passion than gleamedrom o thoso two men's eyes. This may seem strange, as far as -Willoughby is concerncd; but, all surprise will cease, when we state that on encorunterig Ja de, he had suddenly rallied. More than half an hour had elapsed; yet, thc lordli;rg and the Insurrectionist  continued at their bloody work. Tl'hir swords flashed with a thousand sparks, but little blood had been shed. Every vital part haed bee aimed at, yet remained untouched. Cade, having ever befole Ii the destroyen of hisat Bister, nerved himself for ono desperato blow, n parrying a thrust, at the I same time inflicted a death stroke on his antagonist. The seducer fell, as one whose spirit had taken flighlt efore the body reached the grona 1ie fell, with the sword of adeo right tlrough is eart, the blood of Thich,  t thick and dull, clotted his breastplate, and interlaced the rivets witof whichn 1 son thread.

Since the beginning of. the conflict, tlo insurlgents had been radull getting the better of the soldiery; and itseemed fr from improbable that  1 they would ultimately defeat them.

'  Scal cely had the victorious C(ade retiredto tl he quarters which the thou1lit:  ful Gerald had provided for llill, ere ho was aroused from t e deep medi- g t, " tation into which he had fallen, by, th entrance of Lacy:-  "     e Qiek, quik, good Friar, what of my wife, my Mariamno, is she well-' ; is she sfa? Whore tarries she lnow, tha1t sle comes not here to share mhy " Obudling laurelsay'wc -, .                   ,y  of sorrow, or of joy; her ho appy spirit ath taken fighlt to those bright  realoms, wtlither thy    ild had winged aits way so brief a spaee  before." ha  e no                   ri  Ohecking the powrerful emotion which colvulsed his manly form, (ade  motioned the good Lacy to p roced, which ie did, unfolding to the bereft;  husband all the particulars of his Mariane's fate, which were as follows:  On arriving at Say's castle, Lacy found thlat the vnssals, asisted by a f'ew. of the retainers of the house of Clifiord, had nade every possible prepara- ton to detend it, and would, no doubt, hIave ]long hleld it again st te Friar's small force, had he not recollected the postern by .which (ade had gained an entirance on a wfo(rmer ocaon. Giving orders to his men to divert the at- tention of those on the walls by a show of proparations for assault in front Lacy, with a picked body of mren, stole cautiously round till he arrie at the point he sy t, ...he "trn0e to .whichw m .. but feebly defended StpeeI..... .! t .- .:-:,e .e drove all before him, and promising to spare   THE BONDSMAN'S 8TRUGGLE.          9T their lives, on condition of illmmediato surrender, he found himself master of the stronghold. Having admitted the' main body of his men, the Friar demanded to be conducted to. the presence of the Lady Mortimer, who had been so basely abducted. Lacy noticed some signs of a peculiar character passing between the ment but feeling perfectly secure, -paid' no attention to them, but repeated his demands. The Friar here paused in his relation, as if fearful to proceed, but was startled by the vehemence with which his auditor bade him continue his tale, nor mock his fevered senses by such unnecessary delay. '" Pardon me, my friend, that thus adjured I pain thy ears with that which will curdle the blood in thy veins, and freeze up thy every sense with hor- ror.  On entering the apartment in which was confined thy loving wife, I found her fair and beautiful, and placid as an infant's smile. Alas her smile might well be placid, for like a child's, her reason was as weak-she wept, she smiled, she spoke-but the lamp that lights the soul was quenched --all, all, was dark. Her wrongs had seared her brain; and she was --- MAD 1" " Just-God, who lookesb down upon the lofty and the lowly, who turncst not away fromn the prayers of the most abject sinner, grant I beseech thee, strength to this throbbing brain, that it may bear the accumulated weight of misery which thou hast seen fit to lay upon it, and so nerve my arm that I may inflict thy just judgment upon him who hath robbed me of all that made life dear." Having breathed this fervent prayer, Cade,, stifling with superhuman power, his emotion, bade the Friar briefly relate what more of horrors he had to tell, and thus end the torture of his fearful tale. The sympathizing friend proceeded to inform his heart-broken auditor that he had vainly essayed every means which his varied knowledge could suggest, to awaken one glean of reason in the vacant soul of the beautiful nictim, and that the only token she gave of any recollection of past events was on the day preceding her death, when sho suddenly snatched his dagger from his girdle, and holding it aloft, knelt down and seemed, to mutter a prayer to the weapon, which she evidently regarded as a protecting spirit. Having remained in that position some time, she,-at length, kissed the dag- ger, and returning it to Lacy, with. a fearful shriek, fell backwards on the floor in a swoon, from which she never recovered, but expired on the fol- lowing day. Lacy concluded his narrative by informing Cade of the more immediate cause of his wife's insanity. It. appeared, from what he could learn from the inmates of the castle, that on finding herself in the power of Clifford, she had not ceased to upbraid him for his cowardice and baseness, in thus venting upon a weak and defenceless woman that cruelty which he had not manhood enough to practise upon her husband for fear of his avenging arm. At first the love-sick noble had essayed to plead the ardor of his passion in mitigation of this rude wooing, but when he found his captive treated his vows with unconcealed scorn, he urged her acceptance of lis love as the only ;means of saving her husband, who, he falsely swore, was a prisoner within the same walls that confined herself. But, bere, lie overshot the mark, for the heroic woman burst forth in such a torrent of indignant elo- quence at the dastard who sought to make a wife's affection the source of her dishonor, that the galled Clifford would hear nh more,-and rudely seizing her in his vile embrace swore to' ate at once his vengeance and his love. At this point of the Friar's narrative, the increasing emotion of his audi- tor could be no longer restrained, but burst forth with fearfil violence, im- precating upon the guilty head of her ruthless destroyer the most dire curse of an offended God. -Tay, hear me out," exolaiwned the affrighted Lacy, " thy Mariamae fell    98        .JACOK CADE n; OR., not thus, but like the chl;ste Lucretia, in whose cause an indignant people rose, preserved at bloody price the honor of her lord, and plunged a ri end- ly dagger in the heart of him who basely sought to steal that gem, whose radiance beamed for thee alone." With what a revulsion of feeling did the now overjoyed Cade bid the Friar repeat-and yet again repeat--the story of his wife's vengeance, and when he had drank in with greedy ears tie full recital of the story; from which he learned that his wii', in defending his honor and her own had slain the would-be ravisher, he bulst forth into a shout of joy while Lacy was expecting to witness a paroxysm of grief. On the following morn, another demand was made by the Bondsma i's ckampion for the head of the tyrant Say, but no answer being vouch- safed, Oade sounded to the charge, and the men composing the adverse fac- tions met and fought with a determination that gave no signs of decrease. Until mid-day, the contest went so favorably on the part of the insurrec- tionists, as to cause them to have no fear of their driving, as they had driwen on the previous evening, their opponents before them. But a change tool place, and suddenly. The hour of twelve had sounded a few minutes, when it was perceived that the insurgents were giving way. This gave a sudden exultation to the soldiery, and had, naturally, the opposite effect upon the followers of Cade. It was now and for some hours afterwards, that the contest presented a frequent alternation. At one time, it would seem as though victory was about to be proclaimed in favor of the soldiers; at another, it would have been thought the insurgents were about to achieve 'a fresh conquest. Long before the hour that would have seen the departmue of the sun, had the skies have been clear, it was dusk. But, the last struggle was not to be unworthy of those which had gonb before. So far indeed, from this being the case, the efforts of both parties were increased to the very utmost. How- ever, they parted--the soldiers to rest, the insurrectionists to indulge in the commission of violences which their leader had forbade, and which thby themselves, had, hitherto, expressed no wish to indulge in, but which the occurrences of the past day were so well calculated to result in. Yet, thogh the men's minds were so firm in their own bad purposes their bodies had become weakened; which was obvious from their stretching themselves on the ground, seeking slumber. "They sleep," said Cade, speaking to Gerald and his brother. "A good omen for to-morrow; for, hen their sleep hath passed away, they will arise, with strengthened frames, and minds sobered from  the bloody drunkenness they have indulged in. How goeth the time?" "It is the second hour of morning" replied Gerald. "Thou wilt soon hear the clocks strike." "  Let us to our tents," said Cade. The third day of the conflict was marked by a fierceness and desperation which the two previous days, sanguinary as they had been, did not equal. But it would have been obvious to any one skilled in warfare, that the isur- rectionists would ultimately, be compelled to concede conquest to their Opponents. Their very desperation, coupled with their late excesses, was- sufficient to insure this. From an early hour of the day, (ade had seen the increasing probability of his being routed ere many hours had elapsed; but yet he stood, frm in the resolve-of dying where he was. His immediate friends and companions bein  slain, had caused hat before had been a surmise to assume the shape of a conviction; and when Gerald expired, Oade expected the crisis to ome long before it would had he and tho others beoon spared. How long the Alaughter would have continued, or how great would have been the increase of victims, it q difficult to gns had not Aade availed himself of an opportunity that lir. knowledge of the bearings of the place, offerel to him.   THE BOMSMrAN 'S STRUGGLE,.         99 "Follow me!" he exolaimed, loudly as he could, still at the head of the insurrectionists, and brandishing his sword. "Follow me!" he continued several times, leading a few of his men towards the place froln which they had set out previous to their attack on the troops. Hastily did these and their chief retrace their stops to Blackheath, which they reached when a change in the weather and the aspect of the skies was such as to be a type of the darkness of their hopes. jIt being known that many of the rebels, including their leader, had fled to Blackheath, it was determined to steal upon them in the dark. A late hour of the night had therefore been determined upon for the setting forth of the soldiery from London, for those in power entertained a notion that the men sheltered in the cave at Blackheath amounted to a much greater number than they did. The leader of the menl sent out was Say, than whom it would have been impossible to have selected a man more suited to the duty. He knew the names of the leader of the late host and of the officers under hi n, and could appeal to their feelings in behalf of their families, and thus, through their better natures, work their ruin. It was impossible any persons in a state of wakefulness-and many in the cave were so-should remain ignorant of the approach of Say and his followers, the sound of their feet, as well as their horses' hoofs, breaking the otherwise complete silence of the hour. "They come 1" exclaimed Cade. "Up, men, and defeindyourselves! They are upon us, once again," continued Cade. "If thou wouldst not be made the thralls of thine enemies, renew the struggle; if thou wouldst not die the death of dogs, up, and meet tline assailants! ' ear not the issue, for God is with the right and victory is with God.' "* Say was somewhat astonished at the hardihood of a handful of men, such as that whom Cade now headed, daring to oppose him, and, deeming that. they would be glad to accept any terms he chose to offer, thus addressed them:- "Preparatory to taking thee, base rebels, I demand in the name of Henry Sixth, King of England and France, and lord of Ireland, the cause thou hast to adduce, for having waged war with him, even in his capital. Speak, ere we take thee prisoners!" "Stay, men," interposed Cade, perceiving those with him wore about to rush, indiscriminately, upon the men who had been sent forth against them;  "I will answer this bloody agent of a base King. "Thou askest me or rather those men for whom I answer, what we have to complain of? I will tell thee. Of oppression that hath turned trust, duty, and love, into suspicion, revolt, and hatred. Thou thyself art one, of  those who have ridden over the prostrate forms of hundreds, yea, of thou- sands-who have put a tax upon the sweat that droppeth from the toil-worn peasant's brow,; have lashed thy fellows like oxen; and from the serfs bridal bed, pulled the blushing partner of his toils and simple wants, to become the victim of the rich man's gross desires. I speak to tho as IX  would speak to those who sent thee here-I speak to thee, as I would wish . thee to speak th thy master. Take what I have said, thou basi and bloody tyrdnt, as answer to those at whose behests ye have co me forth."  !  "Down with them! down with theml!" was the instant order of the  enraged Say. His words were promptly obeyed. He himself singled out Cade for an  antagonist, being ambitious, for many reasons, to either kill him on the spot or take him prisoner. But, to do either of these he found more difficult than he had anticipated. Wo have already said that Cade was an aooom- plished and able swordsman. Now, he exercised his'weapon with greater force and precaution than usual; for the lives of all his kindred, each one of whom was worth a dozen Says, seemed perched upon his sword's point. * Mr, Forrest, as Jack Cade.     100     JACK CADE; OR, THE BONDSMAN'S STRUGGLE, With many a taunt and biting sneer did Cado prolong the vengeance he knew was in his grasp, for the soul of his adversary in that fearful-struggle seemed at last to shrink from * conflict with one he had so basely wronge'. Whilst our hero was engaged in deadly strife with the man for whom him- self and family had had such bitter cause of hate, he was well aware, from the shouts and cries with which the air resounded, that matters were going sadly against him in the other portions of the field, and having determined not to be taken alive, lie resolved to rid himself speedily of his adversary, and trust to flight as the means of reaching the castle of one of those few\ nobles whose feelings were identified with his own, though they had lacked the courage boldly to avow them. Branding Say as the bloody executioner of his fthethelr he betrayer of his sister, and the murderer of his mother, he exerted all his skill to bring this single-handed contest to a speedy termination, and making a well devised feint, he suddenly plunged his sword up to the hilt in the breast of his ad- versary, ana availing himself of the confusion caused by fall of their gone- ral, fled that field, the fortunes of which it 'was now beyond the power of his single arm to recover. For several weary days did the unhappy fugitive seek shelter in the woods and forests,.satisfying the cravings of nature by such scanty means as chance permitted. In the meanwhile, Lacy having been executed, together with several of the most noted of the insurgents, great efforts were made to ensure the cap- ture of their leader, and at the instigation of the affrighted king, a price was  set upon his head, and numerous bodies of blood-thirsty ruffians were soon- scouring the country in the hopes of earning the base reward of his betrayal. It had been the strong desire of (ade to reach the Druids' grotto, where Lacy informed him, he had interred the remains of his heroic wife, beside -the tiny form of his murdered child; for he felt that could he once more stand in the presence of those who lhad been so dear to him, the pangs of death, and of tlhat which ws worqse than death--defeat-would be robbed of half their bitterness./ Despera;lt were the ec6rts hle made to attain this object, but worn-out nature could bear no ore, and having dragged his wasted form to the con- fines of Sussex, he was there discovered and murdered in cold blood by one Iden, the sheriff of the county, whose coward deed was rewarded with the spurs of knighthood, and a coat of artms bearing the fitting blazon of a gory head in a field sanglaante. Thus perished the hero, but his cause died not with him, for the streams of blood, which at his bidding had flowed in defence of Liberty, awakened a clamorous voice ip the heart of the nation, that ceased not to be heard until the affrighted nobles had yielded that Charter, which shall for over stand as the proud achievement of "  'P1r BowSMA^s' STrrUaG L."
