HELEN COURTENAY'S PROMSE. '-4 CHAPTER I.4 IT was midnight-solemn, mysterious midnight-and a yellow moon, with its broad, bright face, looked curiously upon the world. There was a strange blending in that hour of darkness and light, of things in shadow and things revealed, while the glance of that luminous disc upon an upturned face was like the touch of a cold, unearthly hand upon the brow. It was thus that it seemed to Helen Courtenay, as she left for a moment her dying father's side, and looked through the parted curtains upon the brilliant night, and the wood and river view of her picturesque country home near the Crescent City of the South. If there were beauty there, she neither saw nor felt it- perchance because she looked abroad through blinding tears. Suddenly his voice, breaking a long silence, drew her back to him, over whom a drearier midnight hung than that without-a more gloomy canopy than the weird light of the full-orbed moon. "I would be alone with my child, " he said, "since this is death; since life's conflict is drawing fast to a close, and you tell me I must die to-night, let me see her for a brief time alone."  There were many mourners around the couch of him who spoke these words, and who uttered them as though an imperative necessity impelled him to a duty which could  not be delayed or avoided; and silently, one by one, the watchers departed, exchanging glances of curiosity or       6        HELEN COURTENA Y. astonishment, until the father and daughter remained sole occupants of the apartment. It was painfully trying to the young girl in whose brain the physician's words, " most probably he will die to-night," rang with a deafening sound; and a sense of agony and grief assailed her young heart, which almost stilled its beating into utter insensibility. But what kept her brave and self- possessed at all in that strange hour, and made the mother- less maiden a heroine at once, was the very force of the circumstances in which she found herself, and the necessity for entire self-reliance and self-control. "Is the door closed, my child, and quite secure from intruders?" asked the sick man. "Yes, dear father, all have gone; can I do anything for you, anything to make you more comfortable or to give you ease in your bed of pain?" "I have much to say to you, Helen," he replied; "but let me be in the shadow when I utter my last words; the light upon the mantel is. burning strangely bright, and I would have it extinguished; it seems as though it lit up the heart as well as the outer body, and showed one's inner self to the gaze of others. You will attend to my whims without murmuring, I know, when you reflect that only for a few hours more shall you be troubled with my presence or my exactions." Tears silently coursed each other down Helens face. Then and there, had she followed her impulses, she would have moaned aloud, or sobbed in anguish of spirit; but self had now to be forgotten entirely, she must use every effort to keep her father calm. Quickly extinguishing the light, she approached the bed, and with folded arms pressed tightly against her breast, she awaited the sequel. "Do you love me, child," he asked, the moonlight re- vealing her features distinctly, " that you gaze so piteously upon me as if dreading to let me go Ah! my darling, if the wild anguish in your eyes, the quivering of your lips, and the heaving of your breast are tokens of your affection, then believe me when I tell you that I am all unworthy of you and heaven. Helen, it is a solemn, fear- ful thing to die 1"   HELEN COURTEN YAT.         7 The tears, so long repressed, now gushed forth, and she threw herself passionately down by his side, with a feeling of bewilderment added to her hitherto mute anguish; but soon losing sight of the strange words which implied his unworthiness, she thought only of the physical change and the parting. She could not call reason to her aid; nor could the consolations of religion and philosophy touch her heart. He was near to death; some thing or some one was tak- ing him away from her sight; there would be a cold corpse, unanswering lips, a darkened room, a departure for a damp and narrow bed, and a significant silence: that was all her thought. The scene was no common one; the death-beds of the wealthy and powerful are not often solitary; but this one, though many faithful friends were within call, was unattend- ed save by the presence of a weeping girl. Though the light had -been extinguished, the moonbeams, glancing through the windows, shone upon the sufferer's face, giving to it a ghastly paleness, and revealing in dis- tinctness the rich garniture of the chamber and the sur- roundings, which. told so unmistakably of wealth and refinement. The glittering candelabra hung like so many diamond-drops from the centre of the frescoed wall; here and there were mosaic tables, buhl cabinets, costly marbles, and a few rare and exquisite paintings; while the many mirrors reflected curiosities from every land, and multiplied' in varied positions a unique statue of Sabrina-white, chaste, and beautiful--the guardian spirit of the enchanting spot over which she presided. A glance at the possessor of these luxuries was enough to assure one that not entirely sensuous was his nature; for his high, white brow, his well-formed head, his entire physique, betrayed the predominance of mind over mat- ter-or rather disclosed the fact, that though all that was elegant and refined in sensuality attracted him, he could be enchained only by the intellectual. The time that remained to him was short; he felt it in the premonitory symptoms, which he had required his phy- sician to describe to him, and he longed to speak out his     8        fHELEN COURTENA . oppressing thoughts; but before he gave them utterance, his purpose was arrested as he gazed upon the bowed figure of his child. She was, however, more a child in experi- ence than in years, for nearly eighteen summers had brought no cloud save this to her life, and no lines to her face of youth. The outline of her form, as she knelt, was touching in the extreme; grief seemed to envelop her as with a pall, and though her face was hidden from view, one might as soon have expected a form stiffened by death to have assumed the actions of quick life, as that the countenance of the kneeling girl should have looked up from its position wreathed in smiles. Could a sculptor have sketched her there, she would have lived in marble a triumph of art, for the figure told its own story without the aid of tearful eyes or quivering lips, and every line be- spoke but one idea, that of overwhelming sorrow. A week ago her voice had been a note of joy, her eyes a dwelling-place of light, her step a bound; but now, with the development of the present hour, she was changing, had changed, almost her very identity. A brief time back, she could have been likened to a glowing rosebud; a while later, to the pale rose-attractive still, but somewhat alter- ed in its character. As a careless child she had knelt by her father's couch; as a woman, with the weight of a woman's trials, and with earth's heritage of trouble and care upon her, she arose. "Helen," he said at last, " this certain, near approach of death, with every reasoning faculty strong, and with a voice to express one's doubts and fears, is indeed a terrible thing; but the doom is upon me, and I cannot escape it. Think of seeing some tyrant with drawn sword steadily striding towards you, each step nearer and nearer, until at last you feel the plunge of his dagger in your breast; or imagine the knife of the dissector as probing a living, breathing subject not yet insensible to nature's pangs. Even to the good man this unknown, untried experience must be a fearful mystery, which, though it be attended with beatific visions, must involve certain misgivings as to the future; but to one conscious that he has swerved from his duty, to one who has trusted to more years upon earth to retrieve   HELEN COURTENA Y         9 the past-for me, Helen, it is a foretaste of anything but Heaven." There was no insanity in Allan Courtenay's eyes; never did the light of reason beam more brightly there: but Helen raised her face, expecting to behold in him symptoms of de- lirium. And yet-she felt more sorrow for herself than him, for she knew him, as far as one could know a daily compa- nion, to be a good man; she remembered that he had ful- filled every duty towards herself and the world; she knew that prayer had been ever ready upon his lips, and that he had often relieved the poor and oppressed: therefore the depre- catory cry of " father" which burst from her lips, was not so much in pity for him as for the awakening of herself from a secure and happy dream. "Be calm, Helen," he said, "I implore you; and you must and will be, when I tell you that I lean upon you, in this hour, as a lost man in the desert keeps his eye upon a guiding star. I have a tale to tell you, which you cannot escape; it involves your future as much as it does my past: and though you may attribute my supposed raving to the fever in my blood, and though you may think that the wandering of a disturbed brain gives a heightened color- ing to my words, be not deceived, you will but hear the truth; I shall try to speak briefly and to the point, but hear me patiently through all necessary digressions. It will be hard for you to understand the facts of the case at once, but I cannot die with a thing untold and buried with me; and like the ancient mariner's wedding-guest, I must hold you spell-bound to the end. Through you, I hope to find aid; you must give it to me; and more than this, I expect you to reveal my secret to no human being, unless in some great extremity involving necessity or a sacrifice of truth. Self-denial is comparatively easy; but God forbid that I should entail upon you positive misery. My selfishness does not extend quite so far. Can I entirely rely upon your silence, Helen, except where necessity or truth compels you to speak out?" "As you depend upon my love, dear father," she an swered solemnly. "Then my child holds my honor sacred," he continued, 1*     10       HELEN COUR TEA Y. "and I am content. Outwardly my besetting sin in life has been this very pride of honor, which follows me even to the gates of death. For any man to have doubted that would have made my wretchedness. Inwardly I have lost all sense of the meaning of the word, and a great part of my life has been a betrayal of the orphan's trust. Helen, turn away your eyes; things so pure as they should not look' so lovingly upon a systematic, gentlemanly cheat. I had not the excuses of a felon goaded to madness by hunger, nor of a man with the temptations of a starving wife and children; but behold before you in all his enormity, an educated, moneyed thief. Helen, do you understand " His tone, exquisitely self-sarcastic, could not be comprehended by his listener. "No, father," was the answer; "I do not, nor will I un- derstand." "It is necessary, then, that you should be fully enlight- ened," he answered, sighing deeply; "you shall have the knowledge, but only for a special purpose-that you may save my memory from obloquy and insult, and that the world may regard me ever, as it now does, as the good and con- scientious man. This satisfied craving to be spoken well of, which has so beset me in life, I would have rest like a never-fading laurel upon my grave. What Virtue is to woman-her shield, her beauty, her dignity. her power of usefulness, her sense of worth, her all-is Integrity to man, his bright jewel, his all; and though the reality for me, alas, is for ever departed, I still cling with desperate grasp to the unsteady shadow. A parent looks upon his child for rescue; oh, Helen, Helen!" he cried with outstretched arms, "she will save me, will she not?" These last words were uttered in accents so tender and beseeching, that Helen drew nearer still to her father, and throwing her arms about him, regarded him with still increasing fondness; but no words could she utter-what could she say? She did not believe his self-accusation, she feared to have proof of his guilt; she felt that silence was her best refuge after all. "The time grows short," he said, after spending a brief period in receiving and giving those caresses which had ever been a part of their daily life,-" listen."   HELEN COURTENAY.         " Helen, thus solemnly appealed to, raised herself and stood erect and white, while the moonlight flooded her figure in radiant light, and her voice found utterance. "I cannot believe one word against my father," she said proudly, and with a sublime faith, "even though that father utter his own condemnation; yet, O God, if from some mistaken reasoning of his own, he thinks that he has done wrong, or if others would dare to soil the white page of his memory, then, if word or act of mine can shield him from blame, will I devote my time and powers to keeping his name and fair fame unsullied." With upraised eyes and hand she stood, her voice trem- bling with eagerness, her face radiant with her self-dedication to a holy purpose; and he blessed her as though an angel were uttering words of hopeful promise for his future. "My child," he said fondly, "I accept your self-sacrifice, believing that you will be happier having made it; and though something within me tells me that I am doing you a wrong, I know that she whom I wrong will forgive me for the very love I bear her. I must go back some years to the time when your mother was what you are now, a maiden just entering life. Her father had amassed a noble fortune by his industry, and fondly thinking that we should live for years and gather around us a group of children, he left his property at his death in such a manner that the interest alone could be ours, while the principal was to be reserved for his grandchildren. Young and ardent as I then was, my wants fully supplied by your mother's ample income, and by the proceeds of my own profession, I thought but little of wealth or luxury. Love and a suffi- ciency of this world's goods were enough for my ambition; but soon your mother passed away from earth, and left me alone with my little Helen, now the sole inheritor of her grandfather's estate. At this stage of my life I was pos- sessed with an intense desire to travel; and leaving you in charge of my sister, I went abroad for some years, and in Europe imbibed tastes which were too expensive to suit my income; for having relinquished my profession, I could only depend upon the interest of your grandfather's fortune for my support and yours, the principal of course not     12       HELEN COO URTENA Y. becoming your own until you had arrived at the age of eighteen. The terms of the will, too, galled me; your grandfather had invested his money in an unprofitable way, and I had no power to change the investment to a more lucrative one. This irritated me beyond expression; I fancied that I was born to bask in a life of luxury, that I had a right to the funds lying almost comparatively idle and unproductive, and that by reason of my own merits I deserved riches without attempting to win for myself the grandeur that I coveted." The speaker paused for a moment, as a sudden attack of acute pain assailed him, but soon continued his narration. "Your eyes have been growing brighter, dear child," he said," even though my voice is fainter, because so far you have heard nothing from me which you could positively condemn; but you must suspend your judgment for a while and be prepared for the worst, which will show you to what end this unlawful craving for wealth led me. I had a friend, a friend of my boyhood as well as of my maturer years, whose hopes, whose wishes, whose aims ever told of an unbounded love for me. Like your grandfather, by a life of toil, he too had accumulated a fortune, and married. The parting from his lovely wife, whose death followed the birth of a son, was such a shock and so sore a disappoint- ment to him, that his decease occurred a few years after hers; and in the last hours of his illness he framed a singu- lar will, which showed at once his love for me, his unbounded trust in my rectitude of character, and his pro- vident care of his boy. If he had one predominant passion in life, it was that his child should exert himself manfully for his livelihood; and in accordance with this were the terms of his testament. He left me the sole executor of his will, and bequeathed to me; with the exception of a sum for his son's needful expenses, and sufficient to defray the cost of every desirable branch of education, the whole of the interest of his property until Edward should attain the age of twenty-eight years, when the principal and future interest were to become his own, if deserving of it; if not, the money was to be donated to some charitable institution. In the meantime, it was to be my province to see that the   HELEN COURTENAh .         13 boy had every advantage of a brilliant education, at the completion of which he was to be let loose upon the world, with but a meagre support and his own exertions to sustain him. Moreover, he was to be kept in profound ignorance of his inheritance; and the yearly stipend for his expendi- tures was to be paid him through an agent in Mobile, a mere machine, who knew nothing about the parties con- cerned, as Lee particularly desired that I should be ignored in the matter, and that the boy should have no knowledge of my interest or connexion with his monetary affairs. Edward Lee, the son of my friend, has now reached the age of twenty-four years, is a resident of New Orleans, upright and industrious, and winning for himself golden opinions from worthy men. Thls I hear of him often through others. X The witnesses to the will, two of whom survive, were re- quired by my friend to be thoroughly acquainted with its contents, and were sworn to secresy also, while the only thing required from them was, that at the appointed time they should see that either I or my heirs transferred the property to its rightful inheritor. As the obligation was simply one of honor, and between friend and friend, no duplicate was made of the will, nor was it registered pub- licly, the better to insure me furtherance of his secret design. As you, Helen, alone represent me as my heir, you will be supposed to carry on your father's work with the same faithfulness and strictness," he added, in a tone of bitter sarcasm, "and in four years from this time to deliver up the property." ' Dear father," replied Helen, "the task is an easy one," "And, alas!" continued he, without heeding the inter- ruption, " how remiss I have been! A part of the plan was for me to have watched over this boy as a son; my long absence rendered this impracticable, or I made it so; and when I returned, other causes induced me to shrink from my duty, so that he knows not even the name or the person of his father's dearest friend." "You blame yourself too much," said Helen, soothingly; "I can easily cancel your remissness by my attentions; there is- nothing that is not venial, in what you have done; you have taken a load from my heart."     "       HELEN CO URTENA Y "Would to God that this were all," answered he, trem- bling beneath her loving look; "you have a double secret to guard; the trust of my friend has been misplaced. I have defrauded the orphan, and of that princely fortune not one tithe remains." A look of blank dismay appeared upon Helen's face; the tenderness disappeared for a moment from it. as when a star is overshadowed by a cloud; a blush rose to her cheeks which was almost painful in its intensity; there was no doubting him now, she believed; but she felt herself suddenly endowed with a mighty self-control, a spirit of power which met the exigency of the moment. "Will the property which will be mine next week, on my eighteenth birthday, cover this deficiency?" she asked in measured words. "' Not exactly now," he answered, cowering like a culprit beneath her steady gaze; " properly invested it would, in time." "Now I understand," she said slowly, " what you would have me do." "You begin to see my meaning," he replied, displaying even upon his death-bed the selfishness of his life; " nor would it be great self-denial for you, for a woman's wants are not on the large scale of a man's. But if it be too great a sacrifice, Helen; if you think that you owe something to Frank Stoddard, your confidence and your wealth-give no further thought to your poor parent's misfortunes and faults." She interrupted him almost impatiently: "It would not be too great a sacrifice, father; nothing asked of me by you shall have that name. I see it all; I see plainly what you require of me, and it shall be done faithfully and well. As to Frank's right to know what has become of my fortune, I will tell him that it is appropriated; should he persist in knowing how, I will tell him the truth without entering into particulars, by merely saying that I have paid the debts of our past extravagant life with it; then, if he loves the gold that would have been mine better than myself, I can bid him farewell. Edward Lee shall receive his for- tune at the appointed time, and," added she, proudly, "my father's honor shall be unstained."   HELEN C OURTEA Y.         15 A gratified smile played over the dying man's face, but a deeper look of pallor settling upon it, gave new cause of alarm to Helen. "If there is anything more that you would like to say, dear father, tell me at once, and then try to rest; our con- versation has been far too exciting for you, I fear," she said, in anxious tones. "Only a word or two more," he answered faintly; "you must at once take possession of my keys; in my private drawer you will find my friend's will and other papers. You will need some one to consult and to confide in partly; send for--"  But even as he spoke, Helen perceived a marked change in his countenance; the guide, the half confidant's name was left unsaid, while the paroxysms of pain, which the physician foretold, came on with terrific force. Seeing this, she rushed alarmed to the door, and called loudly for help. Friends hastened in with a hope to alleviate his pain, but it was too late for anything but a brief farewell. His hour of departure was nigh; sad words of love were spoken, and their cares were divided between the death- struck father and his anguished child. Among the rest a well-tried friend stood by his pillow, and endeavored by soothing remarks, which proved to be mistaken kindness, to make the struggle less poignant. "It is, indeed, hard to part with you, Courtenay," he said; "but a merciful God knows best. And yet how mys- terious it seems to us that He should spare the earth- cumberers, and take such as you away, one whose purity of life is an example, whose heart is the very home of honor." "Helen, Helen," almost shrieked the dying man, as he writhed in bodily and mental pain between delirium and sanity, " you hear himn; remember to keep your promise." These were Allan Courtenay's last words, and whether in the sunlight or the moonlight, or the starlight or the darkness, in a crowd or in solitude, she remembered them, and the beseeching eyes turned upon her, and the extended arms as if praying to her, and the death-groan and the eternal silence. And her memory clung to the after events -the friends who led her away, and the tightened grasp     16       HELEN CO URTENA Y. of her hand upon the keys, which locked up her secret, and the long weary night, and the morrow's dawning, and the reading of his meaningless Will, which left to her all his earthly possessions, and the knowledge forced upon her that she was an orphan, with a weight upon her brain and in her heart which she could ask no one to help her to lighten, but must take with her as her inseparable com- panion into the wide, wide world. CHAPTER II. IN order to be acquainted with our heroine, for such is Helen Courtenay, and to follow her whither she leads us, it is necessary to know something of her past history. God smiled upon Allan Courtenay and his wife, and gave them in the morning of their life a child. I say smiled, because the word is full of meaning as applied to the sub- ject. And here I would disagree with the poet when he says of a maiden, "A smile of God thou art," for to, me an infant only can be anything so fresh, so pure, so beauti- ful; for later the world's passions mar the perfect loveliness of the new creation, and its spotless purity has gone. But a child in the house! Oh, ye, who watch the unfolding of a plant as its leaves open to the sunshine; or ye who dig deep into the heart of science, making its mysteries plain; who study the meaning of the stars and fashion the elements into play- things--descend from your heights of learning and watch with me over the development of a child. Of what un- studied arts it is master; what an amount of innocent plea- sure it gives without an effort; how it converts enemies into friends, and draws friends nearer and yet nearer toge- ther, tuning the discordant strings of human nature, until they utter sweet sounds, and accord in perfect harmony. How it warms into life a whole circle of cold-hearted world- lings! Said a mother to me once: "What a blessed insti-   HELEN C O URTENA.        17 tution that would be which kept the last infant in a house- hold ever an infant." What a pretty but impracticable thought; a fresh bud each morning to greet one, a young voice to fall upon the dull ear of age ; a tiny hand to smoothe the wrinkled brow; a green, tender link, binding toil-worn and weary hearts! But alas, it must not be so. Years come, and the embryo society-framer changes from what God made it to what man makes it, and then it loses its freshness and originality, and acts as others, as you and I do, as it has been taught by experience; a necessary training, the wise say, but one that takes from it its peculiar title to that poetic word-linking: "A smile of God."                   a And -thus Helen changed. Her parents watched over her infancy with the most religious child-worship for a while, and then the young mother closed her eyes in death and was laid away where never more the soft hands of her cherished one would circle around her neck, or the rosebud lips draw life from her still bosom, or the roving eyes look smilingly into hers; and Courtenay fled far away with a fierce unrest -and an almost rebellious grief gnawing at his heart. It was something like relief for him to be in action, even though it took him from the grave which held her whom he had loved so well, and from the unconscious babe who knew not the meaning of that most fearfiA of words, the word motherless. He left her in good keeping, so his conscience told him, ever remembering her in his numerous letters, and laying down laws for her physical and mental development. He was most careful of the first, for Helen had been born in the free, healthy air of the country, and there he designed her to remain with- his sister, who was not so abundantly blest with worldly goods as himself. She gladly undertook the management of her brother's house- hold, for what he wished for his child in a pure and healthy atmosphere, she gladly accepted for her son, a boy a year older than the little girl, and Helen's daily companion. But Mrs. Stoddard found, ere long, that the discipline and training of her gentle and teachable Frank, were things ever to be separated from the discipline and training of her brother's child, who, to use a homely expression, seemed     1 q       HELEN COURTENA Y rathler to bring herself up than to be brought np; thus when the Rubicon was passed which divides the infant without reason from the child with reason, a machine from a responsible agent, with brain and intelligence acting for itself, she thought, after many experiments, that it was best, except in flagrant cases of misdemeanor, to let her brother's daughter alone ; for, while the common rules of management answered for the one, the other was independent of all control. And H[elen was not perfect; she fell far short of that crowninr attribute of a heroine which I would fain bestow upon hpr, but which, to be truthful, must be withheld. It was not that passion ever made a demon of her, or that positive sin deformed her; but her fault lay in her indomi- table self-will, or, to use a harsher term, obstinacy, which led her into rebellion and disobedience. At first her aunt tried to restrain her, but as mistakenly as she did the flower which grew near her window, and which pertinaciously turned sunward.  For a little while her training sufficed to curb the hidden strength which so surely, yet so silently, was working within; but the difficulty was too near the root to be overcome, and soon leaf and bud and blossom were quietly asserting their rights, and were looking towards the light as faithfully as a Persian towards the East. To say that Helen did not try to be what her aunt called "good " would be unjust, because she was diligent at her tasks until the hour of temptation came, when her thoughts led her away to the deep, dark woods, and the wild flowers so sparsely scattered, yet so effective when grouped together in her Florence vases, and the water-lilies on the pond, upon whose leaves she saw higher revelations than in her books: thus when the hour for recitation came, the inat- tentive student was all unprepared for examination, with the certain knowledge that reproof was in store for her. It was in a mood like this one day that Helen found herself with the prospect of a lonely afternoon for the punishment of her idleness. She had struggled like a sub- ject of mesmerism against the charm without; could she have committed to memory the unmeaning words that lay like a dead weight of print before her, she would have done it, for it was to her own interest to memorize the task; but   HELtY CO M TrEA Y.        19Y. a -counter influence drew her thoughts away into the fresh air, where the grass was so green, the sky so temptingly blue, and where the very birds, alighting on the neighbor- ing trees, sang a song, the burden of which seemed to be: "Come out into the sunshine." And Helen, closing her book,'assured the birds, in some- what their own fashion, that it was the very thing which she intended to do, and that she would join them in a few minutes, in fact just as soon as she could tie her gipsy, bonnet under her chin. But alas, for summer songs or air- castles! She felt a hand upon her shoulder, and heard her aunt bid her remain a prisoner at home during the entire afternoon; then she saw that the window-sash was relent- ,lessly shut down, and that the key of the door was turned upon her captive self, a sound as ominous to her as to a jail- immured prisoner. Left alone, she was at'first inclined to be quiescent; but a moment after there was something within her, call it rebellion if you choose, which-gave to her free soul wings. Remain there she could not and would not, when earth, air, sky, and birds all uttered so tempting an invitation; and though as yet was undeveloped the strong will which was her great characteristic in after life in overcoming difficulties, in that day's experience it must have had-its birth. She raised the sash softly and looked with' longing eyes at the landscape. It brightened even her child-eyes with- its rich beauty; and plain, and hill, and stream seemed painted with fresh attractions. The air was vocal with the, song of birds, not dreamily soft as at times and blending with the universal harmony; but glad and distinct, as though for a jubilee; the bleating lambs skippedloyously over the fields, the trees stirred in the fresh breeze, and thrilled as though endowed with life and enjoyment. Helen gave another loving glance around, which seemed to say that she was out of place: surrounded by the four contracted walls of her, prison-house, as much as would, have been the lark beating its aspiring wings against the sense- less pane, and then she measured with her eye the distance from the window where she stood to the ground, with a vain hope that with a dangerous but desperate leap she     20       HELEN COURTENA Y might escape from her durance vile. But her inclination to be more agile than the bravest gymnast on record did not avail her anything; upon second thoughts, it was an under- taking not to be dreamed of in theory, much less in prac- tice. There was a way, however, and it seemed clear to her, as with something of a woman's strength, because her heart was in her work, she deliberately tore into strips a cloth which covered her study-table. These she knotted to- gether, then fastened one end firmly within the room, let the other drop from the window, and once more giving a hasty glance around to see that she was not observed, com- menced a somewhat perilous descent by the aid of her impromptu ladder, and after much heart-beating, safely reached the ground. Once free, never did released bird seek the cover of the woods more swiftly than did Helen, as she ran across the park towards her favorite haunt, where the boughs made a natu- ral arbor, the ground of which she had carpeted with shin- ing pebbles. There she busied herself by gathering fresh boughs to ornament the flower-stands; then bringing a fresh supply of spring water, she sprinkled the pebbly floor, and then sat down to see if anything more could be done to ornament or improve the sacred place. But with her ceas- ing to be busy, her thoughts became more active; she was not satisfied with herself; and though she knew that she had achieved a point and gained a victory, she felt that she had done wrong, and after an hour's most uncomfortable self-commune returned home a penitent. As her love of truth was ever a safeguard, and quite equal to her determi- nation of character, she went to her aunt and made a full confession of her escape, promising as a penance to have the neglected lesson fully learned by the morrow, and once again the child's will asserted itself in a peculiar manner. Remembering that she had heard a visitor once say that words, traced with the finger in the air at night, would be remembered the next day, Helen, with firm faith, applied the process to her own case, and commenced the task. Every line of her lesson was so written, and midnight found her alone and at her mystical work. Probably that weird air-tracing had simply the effect of concentrating her   HELEN CO RT0  A .        21 attention; it is sufficient to know that upon the next day she found that she had memorized the paragraphs as per- fectly as her aunt could desire. Frank Stoddard loved his little cousin, but it was the yielding part of her nature to which he clung, not her impe- rious, exacting self. When her moods of rebellion came upon her, his gentler spirit stood in awe of her, and he left her presence for solitude, trying to forget that she was otherwise than what he delighted to paint her, because he felt that as such only did she claim or could he give her that protection which a boy, proud of belonging to the stronger sex, is ever desirous to bestow upon a dependent and timid girl. But it was not often that Helen made an appeal for his protection, for she gloried in her own inde- pendence; she took pleasure in showing him that she was a stranger to fear, and joined him with unwearied powers in all those sports which belonged rather to his sex than to hers. As her years increased, however, she found that he loved her less when she surpassed him in feats of daring, and this conviction was forced upon her when she one day brought to him a crow's nest, of which he had in vain tried to get pos- session, and which she had climbed to the topmost branch of a very tall tree to procure. To be sure it had taken her the greater part of a holiday morning to obtain her prize.; but not repeated failures, or the slight yielding branches, or the slippery bark of the tree, or the dizzy height deterred her, and with a smile of triumph she took the coveted prize to her cousin. Instead of the glad glow of joy on her own face being reflected on his, she saw only scorn, and heard a sarcastic remark upon her masculine tastes, partly because jealousy was the foundation of his feelings, jealousy of her superior strength and daring, and partly because she had stepped from her province into his. And this was one of Helen's first lessons in the art of trying to conceal herself and her own proclivities instead of acting ag her nature prompted. At first she found it more politic to assume an attitude of inferiority, but gradually an innate sense of dignity and her position as a woman, and therefore some- thing secondary, as custom has decreed it, gave to her an     22        HELEN -  S O wTE-A . air of trusting dependence from which she but seldom departed. And Frank surrendered himself to the charm, forgetting that the very qualities which he dreaded and condemned were not dead, but only concealed like the hidden strength of a slumbering giant. But Helen's ruling passion, and that which overmastered all others, was her love for her father; he ever seemed to her like an invisible guardian angel, a benefactor afar off, whom at some future day she had the certain promise of beholding; and this romantic attachment was increased by the gifts which he was constantly sending her from foreign lands-dresses almost too exquisite in texture for the little country girl; books with the brilliant colorings of Parisian taste; toys of complicated machinery, and jewelry which, to her admiring eyes, seemed fit to deck the person of some Eastern queen, while his letters held forth the fact of her eventually beholding him as a -crowning joy for whole years of absence.       - And at last he came; the best portion of his life spent in the service of strangers; his nature artificial from long contact with worldlings; travel-worn, life-weary. to his daughter, and his quiet country-seat. Allan Courtenay believed that nothing could interest him more, for he had drunk deep of the all of pleasure which life can give; and sick of sight-seeing, tired of men, tired even of himself, and with a conscience never at rest, be- cause of a trust betrayed, he had come home chiefly to gratify the restless desire for change which had become his inseparable companion. Sometimes, when he thought of that home, a vague feeling of content sent a moment of peace to his soul, for he remembered his daughter, and the remembrance gave an object to his life; he thought that it would be a purpose worthy of great pains to scatter some of the pearls of knowledge which he had gathered in his travels into her secluded path of life; but often this almost holy thought passed away and left only a craving for peace, a longing for rest, even if it brought oblivion, and his home presented itself to him in the same light with which men sometimes look forward to the quiet of the grave. But so it did not prove; his neglected child, when she became a   =iE  S  XZ.-GQBStfEP     23 reality and ceased being simply a mem  ory or a..distant hope, stood out in bold relief from the darker shades of his life, luminous with brightness, drawing him to her with resistless force, and giving to him new experiences and delights all unfelt and unknown before. Helen Courtenay, at twelve years of age, was in appear- ance just what she continued to be through her whole life, save that after the eyents at her father's death-bed, the light in her face seemed to fade away, as the moon leaves the skies to the stars; something marble-like and statu- esque in that fateful hour taking the place of the joy of child- hood. She came to meet him on his return with a dignity almost womanly, and then after a glance of inquiry into his eyes that rested not upon the surface, but seemed to pierce deeper than the outward expression which men, and espe- cially men of the world, can assume at pleasure, she rushed passionately into his arms, and nestled there as in the arms of one lost and found. In that searching glance she had discovered a mine of gold, pure and inexhaustible, an ever- flowing fountain of love. Through that day, and through every succeeding day, he was bewildered by the mystery of her growth and deve- lopment; constantly comparing the helpless, cradled child whom he had forsaken, with the wondrous being now before him, endowed with a sentient soul, and understand- ing to appreciate all that he imparted to her. His eyes followed her every motion; his ears caught greedily every sound of her voice. He did not admit to himself that she was beautiful, nor did he feel a need of the presence of so sensuous a thing as beauty in her face; he had not found her peculiar characteristics in the types of Greece and Rome which he had worshipped so fervently awhile ago, but it was the whole that interested him. There was a charm in the lithe gracefulness of her well proportioned figure, her elastic tread,; her proud head, with its occasional haughty bend and its wealth of smoothly-parted hair, which he had recognised in no pictured or human form that he had ever beheld, and which elicited from him a strange compound of feelings--a fatherly love mingled with an almost unconscious respect-a paradox which, interpret-     24       HELqEN COVRTEYA Y ed, meant: "Thou, in thy weakness, art stronger than But what had attracted him most in this child-woman's mysterious development, were Helen's eyes, that gave out a steady, solemn light, as though they were answering ange glances all unseen by other mortal eyes; at least this was their common, every-day expression; but there were times when their moonlight softness became flame light, and a lion looked out from the fold of the lamb. And watching these changes, her father concluded that strength rather than beauty was that which gave so peculiar an influence to his child-a sort of indefinable power displaying itself in every gesture and movement; in the wave of her slender hand, the sudden uplifting of her eyelids, or her firm foot- fall, unconsciously giving her the bearing of a crowned queen. Then, as later, what Helen Courtenay did, rather than how she looked, wrought out her destiny. If she won love, it was not because she was fair to look upon, but because a strange charm lingered about her and created in those around her a desire to know her better, and to be included in the sphere in which she personally moved; to feel the touch of her hand in the clasp of friendship or passion; to hear the tones of her voice in a whisper meant for one alone; to sound the depths of her heart, and to have a claim upon the rich treasures of affection hidden in that exhaustless mine. Under Italian skies or within the precincts of brilliant Paris, in just such a child, walking bare-footed without pro tection, or carolling songs about the street, men would have beheld some embryo tragedy-queen, some cantatrice whose voice would have moved a world; it was not strange, then, that her father should have trembled even while he rejoiced in watching her extraordinary gifts. Like one who in youth has planted a sapling, marking the spot for recognition in after years, and having forgotten the event, has come back to find a tree towering above him, with leaf and branch and blossom waving in the wind, and who looks incredulously and with strange surprise at the result of that long-ago experiment; so, likewise, did Allan   HELEN COURTEVNA .        25. Courtenay look with dreamy wonder upon the child, who at last forced the conviction upon him that this fascinating blending of power and love and beauty belonged to him, was exclusively his own. CHAPTER IIL A YEAR elapsed, and the father and daughter had learned to understand each other. Unconsciously each had been measured by the other, and the strongest love was the result; this was based upon a mutual respect called forth in him because of her natural gifts and independence of character, and religiously fostered in Helen, because of the lofty estimate which she had placed upon her parent's worth, and which he was careful not to forfeit outwardly. Of his inner life she knew nothing. And Helen's exercise of will in a wrong direction, was somewhat checked by her father's presence, for he explained to her that such an element in her disposition, under proper control, would be a powerful agent of good, but if indulged in to excess, would terminate in the worst results, and eventually bring forth the direst evils. But she had not yet learned the entire art of self-control, as an incident which occurred about this time will show. Helen came one morning to bid him good-by, equipped for a ride in search of her cousin, and the parent was startled by the change that a year of thought had made in her appearance. Though a child's graces lingered about her, a more mature charm gave to her a new interest, as though the parting day were meeting the coming night, and mingling the brightness of the one with the softness of the other; or, as the poet hath better said, she was at that period of life- "Where the brook and river meet, Womanhood and childhood fleet." 2     26       HELEN CO URTENAY. As her father saw her approaching, he mentally considered what might be in store for her, little imagining how entirely he would be the means of shaping her destiny. "Queen-like in action and form," he said to himself, "hers should never be the position or sphere of a queen, for power and unlimited prosperity would make a tyrant of her; nor should misfortune and utter poverty be her lot, for to crush her would make her madness or her death." No; the only path that Allan Courtenay in his wisdom judged to be the fitting one for his child, was the common every-day lot of woman, varied with joy, and sorrow, and trial, and compensation for trial, where the affections would serve as a balance to keep in order the wilful and erratic part of her disposition. In his wisdom he indeed judged thus; in his selfishness he decreed otherwise, for the bark which he should have moored into a quiet harbor, he guided recklessly upon a rocky and dangerous cliff. Helen's parting words aroused him from his reverie; and as she rode off, her black plumes floating on the air, her well proportioned form, in its careless, easy grace, disappear- ing from view, he smiled and sighed, while a vague feeling of unrest took possession of his heart and brought a cloud to his brow. Perchance, even then, he was framing in his mind how best he could ask of her the sacrifice which his sense of honor demanded. But Helen departed in search of her absent cousin, all unconscious that life was anything but a holiday, her home a Paradise, and her father the ministering angel of her heaven. It was an easy matter for her to find Frank, for he had designated their trvsting-place, a fall in the heart of the woods, where a torrent of foaming water, which they had playfully named their Niagara, rushed impetuously down a mass of broken ridges, while a few planks had been thrown across for foot passengers, though an equestrian seldom ventured, even when the flow was calmest, to cross the romantic but insecure structure. Helen discovered, when she had reached the bridge, that Frank was on the opposite side of the stream; and in answer to her question, inquiring in what way he had gained his   HELEN COURTENA Y.         27 position, he replied, that finding the torrent so swollen, in fact impassable, he had taken a circuitous path through the field, advising her to do likewise. Nor was Frank's advice to be spurned; for recent rains had so increased the volume of the stream, that the water no longer dashed under the planks, but over them, shaking the frail fabric toc its foun- dations, and threatening each moment to demolish the whole edifice. "Stop, stop, for heaven's sake!" cried Frank, as he saw helen about to descend the declivity which led to the bridge; "do not attempt to cross, Helen, above all on horseback; if one of us must cross, I will come over to you, if you will wait an instant. You do not know how dan- gerous it is." "So much the more exciting then will it be," said Helen, urging on her steed; "and whether you decide to come over or not, Frank, I must cross that bridge to-day. I shall feel like another Caesar when I stand where you are, and look back on my glorious achievement." But it was not so practicable a matter as Helen imagined, for her horse stood motionless, as though he knew by instinct of the peril; but this resistance only fixed her determina- tion more firmly. Giving him a quick blow with her rid- ing-whip, he made a plunge forward, and then was as still as before, the margin of the stream laving his feet as he stood. Helen did not again resort to violence; to be suc- cessful required tact rather than force or anger; she had as stubborn a nature as her own to oppose her, and she knew that a stern, unflinching will was her best weapon and surety of success, accompanied wilh an entire mastery over herself. Bending forward, and laying her hand firmly yet kindly upon the glossy neck of her steed, she spoke a few words close to his ear, but in a tone which he seemed fully to comprehend, and to have heard before; there was no tremor in her-voice, but every syllable, like the short yet imperative utterances of a leader of an army, was a note of command. The charm worked so well that when, a moment later, and after a brief silence as signi- ficant as speech, Helen gathered up the reins more firm- ly in her hand, and said,. "Come, I am ready now," the     28       HELEN CO URTENA Y. well trained creature, without more resistance, advanced upon the dreaded path of terror. No cries nor remonstrances from Frank could avail to bend her from her purpose; when he regarded her with pleading or commanding or angry glance, he only encoun- tered a look which meant, "Silence, I am resolved;" and finding how useless all such demonstrations were, he breathlessly awaited the result. The little bridge shook beneath the unusual weight which it upheld, but this did not take away Helen's self- possession, for she steadily watched each step which car- ried her onward, fully alive to the danger which threatened her, and in low but emphatic tones spoke encouragingly to the noble animal that bore her. Meantime, the torrent came leaping and foaming, and making wild music as it dashed along, while a sudden gust of wind gave violence to its onward flow, changing the rippling waters into swelling, angry waves. At this moment but half of the bridge was crossed, and even Helen for an instant grew pale; but there was no retracing her way, had such a thought occurred to her; there was no alternative-on- wards or deathwards she must go. She had need of turn- ing white, Frank thought, as he stood gazing with horror at the scene, for the faithful steed showed signs of fear in his starting eye-balls and quivering flesh. In his trepida- tion, the animal instinct of danger, lay the safety of both; for terror lent swiftness to his feet, and with one desperate leap he crossed the remaining space. In an instant after a crash was heard, a creaking and giving way of timbers, and a wilder dashing of the waves, while Helen and her companion beheld the bridge, over which she had so lately passed, floating away with the boiling current. Frank, faint-hearted, uttered a groan of dismay; but Helen, after a "Bravo, good Bertram," to her horse, calmly said: "I told you that I would cross it, Frank, and you Qee that I have kept my word." "Yes," he answered, coldly, " your perseverance-I have given it its mildest name, Hclen-will one day work out some one's ruin."   HELEN COUR TENA Y        29 "Or some one's salvation, Frank," she answered quickly. Nor were her father's strictures upon her conduct less severe when he heard of her almost foolhardy feat, and he reasoned with her most eloquently as to how she had erred and why. Helen listened tearfully, for she longed to please him in all things. Her repentance was as sincere as her act had been rash. "What urges you on," he "asked, as they were about to part for the night, "to these acts of daring and reckless- ness, where nothing seems strong enough to curb your spirit of adventure?" "It is my nature, father, she answered, "just as it is the eagle's nature to fly." "You must ehange your nature, then," he replied. I will try, father," was the humble answer; and from that day she began in good earnest to check that free proud, aspiring will which so often broke the chains of cus- tom, and brought upon her the displeasure of those whom she loved. In Helen's fourteenth year Mrs. Stoddard died, and Mr. Courenay turned his whole attention towards giving his daughter and nephew every advantage in education that wealth could procure. In Helen he found a willing recipi- ent of his views, for she applied herself with extraordinary industry to her new avocations, her ambition being excited, independently of the love which urged her on to gratify her father. But while he aimed at making her a linguist by patient study, and a musician by constant practice, she passed much of her time in the simple pursuit df pleasure. Luxury surrounded her on every side, and her love of the beautiful if art and nature was fostered in every possible way, while the very air that she breathed was made to minister to her enjoyment. Thus her home became a cen- tral point of attraction to her young friends, who came, as to a perpetual gala, to partake of Mr. Courtenay's hospi- tality, and to join in the pastimes which he provided with so tasteful and lavish a hand. With untiring kindness he planned schemes for their entertainment, and his reward came to him in a new and fresh way, inasmuch as he, who had ever lived selfishy to be ministered to, found gra- 4     :0       IIELEN COURTEA Y. tification in ministering to the pleasure of others; added to this, their admiration of his fertile genius was secured, and their gratitude gained, while to him was afforded recreation and amusement of no ordinary kind. He encouraged in his daughter and her friends a love of dramatic representations, and induced Helen, especially, to make a study of the finest scenes from the best dramatic writers, giving her as a daily exercise passages to commit to memory from the most celebrated productions of Shak- speare, holding to the opinion that, apart from the glitter and excitement of a theatre, the drama tended to refine. and purify the mind, and was a school which taught many a lesson of permanent benefit. In this way the leading characters of the great masters of the stage became to Helen like people who had lived and thought, realities whose words she echoed, whose costumes she adopted, when her companions and herself performed those plays selected by her father for the entertainment of a few chosen guests in his genial home. It was no marvel, then, that she admired and appreciated literature of this description, or looked with a feeling akin to pride on a picture of herself, which her father had caused to be painted by a great artist of the time, where she was repre- sented as Ophelia crowned with fantastic straws, and decked with flowers, a perfect embodiment of the idea of the author's almost inspired conception. It was on the night before Frank's departure on his life- mission, namely, a place in the navy, that Mr. Courtenay gave a fete in honor of his nephew, which made a lasting impression on the minds of those -who participated in it, and colored the destiny of those of this tale in whom we are most interested. Avoiding the hackneyed pageant of a fancy ball, where correctness of costume is so often sacri- ficed to variety and love of show, he arranged a series of His- torical Tableaux, thus blending for the youth who engaged in the performance, amusement and instruction. He super- intended the dresses and attitudes of each and all, and chose the scenes for representation, such as The Death-bed of Queen Elizabeth; a picture from the life of Mary, Queen of Scotland; Richard the Lim's Camp in the East; the   HELEN CO URTENAY.         31 Cornelia of Rome, and a quaint passage in Cromwell's career; these, and many more representations less familiar and trite, delighted the company and the performers, and refreshed their memories or fixed some authentic transac- tion upon their minds; but as it is only Helen's develop- ment that interests us especially, it is upon her alone that our attention must dwell. In the scene of the Rescue of Captain Smith, she had impersonated the noble Pocahontas; her brunette complex- ion, long black hair, slender form, and quick movements, being singularly appropriate to the part which she sus- tained. Her calm, every-day look had been exchanged for an expression of Indian caution, mixed with a slight touch of subtlety, as though it were something hereditary from an ancestral chieftain of Powhatan's, which did not for an instant mar the harmony of her expression, but seemed to make her an equal match for the king, her father, who held his captive's doom in his hands. The captive himself lay bound, awaiting his death-stroke; Powhatan stood stern and statue-like, pointing with a signal-gesture to the pros- trate figure of his prisoner, whose head rested on a lowly pillow of stone. Two warriors, with uplifted but arrested clubs, seemed about to obey their chief's significant motion; while the young Indian princess, decked in all the brilliant colors of her tribe and position, with her arms wound around the captive's head, and her face upraised to her father's, knelt between the doomed one and his destruction. The look not only asked, but required the sparing of his life; it was tenderness linked with command, all that is gentlest and best in woman mingled with her woodland birthright, the inheritance of courage, worthy the daughter of a forest king. This was the closing tableau, and this also was the impersonation which remained longest in the memories of the spectators; others were machines, and performed their parts mechanically and well; it was the soul of genius which gave to Helen's representation its impress of reality, and made the beautiful life-picture a brilliant and crowning suc- cess. The guests had all departed, and a William Tell and a     32        HELEN C O URTENA Y. Queen of Sheba, a Joan of Are linked arm-in-arm with King Arthur, and a Cleopatra escorted by a New England Puritan, had bade their hostess farewell, leaving her alone to muse over the events of the evening. Instead of reclining on forest leaves with warriors and implements of death around her, and the blue arch of heaven a canopy overhead, the representative of Pocahontas was seated in a spacious arm- chair, her head drooping backwards in an attitude of quiet thought, her quiver of arrows slung carelessly upon her shoulder, her bow held loosely in her hand, her myriad beads of anklets, wristlets, and necklace, glittering in the light, and her slender feet, in their embroidered moccasins, glancing like birds of bright plumage from beneath her forest kirtle. At seventeen a reverie is a delicious thing; life is gold- tinted, all the winds that blow are zephyrs; all the rains that fall but make the earth fruitful; frowns are smiles in disguise; earth is Paradise: and as Helen mused, each thought was brighter than the last, existence in itself a joy, the past a happy dream, and the future a mine of untold pleasure. Helen's reverie was unceremoniously interrupted, not by Captain Smith uttering thanks for his unlooked-for rescue, nor yet by Powhatan, half frowning, half smiling at her temerity, but a cavalier in silken hose and doublet bent over her until his white plume mingled in her raven tresses, and his jewelled hand sought and clasped her own. "Helen, I have come to say farewell; before your eyes are unclosed to-morrow morning I shall be far away." She looked up as if just awaked from sleep; she knew that the parting hour must come, but did not expect it so soon; in fact, could not realize it. She was aware that the occupation that her cousin had chosen was peculiarly suited to his tastes; but now that the time had really ar- rived for him to leave her, her heart sank within her at the prospect. And it was natural to her to feel sorrow, for Frank had been the sharer of her childish joys and sorrows, bearing the blame of many faults, when she alone had been in the wrong. She could not contemplate her com- panionless state with any degree of patience, and the me-   WEEL EN C OUR TENA Y.      33 mory of his kindnesses and forbearance came visibly before her now. "Shall vou ever miss me, Helen?" he asked, in a sor- rowful tone. "Always, dear Frank,"' she answered, while tears sprang to her eves, and her voice quivered as she spoke. "Then, Helen," said the youth, emboldened by her ready sympathy, and with eyes as tearful as her own, "I must tell you now, before I go, that I love you better than any one in the world. I shall never forget you, for the thought of you will keep me from everything that is unworthy, and I shall study for your sake so ardently, that when I return from my three years' voyage men shall speak well of me, and when I hear their praise I shall know that you have been my inspiration." "Three years!" said Helen, with bowed head, and now fairly overcome with tears; "what a- long and dreary time to look forward to; life will seem so objectless without you; my lessons so difficult, my pleasures so common- place. Oh, Frank! I wish after all that you were not obliged to go." "The path that I have chosen," said the cavalier, proudly drawing himself up to his full height, "I must follow, even though those I love bid me stay; but, Helen," and his head bent lower as he whispered in 'her ear, and his hand trembled as his heart beat more quickly, " there is. some- thing that will make this absence shorter and less dreary; will you try ever to love me as you do now, and will you give me the hope that some day in the fiuture you will be my wife, and that you will keep your smiles and your heart for'me until I return?" The Indian's eyes were straightway raised to his; there was a sound as -of the soft clashing of a thousand beads, and she stood upright before him, with nothing indeed lilke love-light in her earnest gaze, but a world of interest and cousinly affection therein. '; As if I could love any one else," she said reproachfully; ' no one could ever make me so happy as you, Frank; no one understands my ways so well; no one gives up so en- tirely to my whims and foolish fancies as yourself. Ah, yes,     3 4       HELEN' COUP, TEMA Y. when you return, if you have been brave and noble, I shall feel proud to think that through all scenes and changes you will come back to me unchanged." As Helen -.id these words, and as Frank looked down upon her upraised face, a third person, who had stood for a while unperceived at the door, gazing admiringly upon the pretty and unpremeditated tableau, advanced towards them. It was Helen's father, and Frank met him with a beam- ing smile. ( Uncle," he said, with that charm of frankness which was wonderfully attractive to all who knew him, "Helen has just told me that one of these days, when I have proved myself worthy, and when added years have given dignity to my pretensions, she will be my wife. We love each other, and shall love each other for ever." Oh, blissful anticipations of youth; oh, morning clouds, beautiful at dawn, but fading away at evening! Some such ejaculation as this was uttered by Allan Courte- nav. He deemed their morning cloud unreal and visionary, but was on the whole pleased with their unsolicited confidence; there was nothing clandestine about the matter; his daugh- ter's healt was entirely open to his view, and he loved them all the better for their faith in each other and trust in him- self. With this change of thought a different expression appeared upon his face, the almost mocking smile departed, and he viewed the circumstances which had been placed before him in another light. They loved each other-then what better fate could await them than a marriage, based upon affection? Who could understand his child so well as one who had been her companion for years; and where could a truer heart, a more generous spirit, and a nobler nature be found in the world than Frank's? He would not crush their hopes, nor would he bid them check the thought of love for each other; but regarding them affectionately, he addressed them with great kindness. "Make no rash promises, my children," said he, "but wait; then, if in the future you truly care for each other, God grant that your maturer years may be as happy as those of your youth have been."   HELEN COUR TENA Y.        35 And the next day Frank departed on his voyage, while Helen mourned him most sincerely, believing in her inmost mind that she loved him entirely. But she was mistaken; it was simply the love of a heart that knew not its own capacities or possibilities, nor woman's most imperative need-the joy of leaning on a stronger nature, of reaching upwards rather than bending downwards in the one life- long affection which takes the place of all others upon earth. Woman may love a child because it is weak and dependent; a brother or sister, because they are objects of sympathy or pity; her parents, because the tie, however unworthy they may be, at once presupposes a state of affection; but for none of these things can she, or dare she, love her hus- band; the very causeswhich nurture these blood-ties are the death of the other. She must be able to say to him with her whole soul: "Lead thou the way: I will follow." But could Helen argue thus   No, it was a common case; she was bound to another by circumstances and pro- pinquity, not by that strong necessity which God has made a part of our nature of loving, and moreover of seeking to find our twin-soul in this wilderness around us, where the false is so often substituted for the fitting and the. true. And here closes this- chapter of our heroine's life ; and now that we know something of her virtues and her faults, her temptations and her needs, we can follow her and sym- pathize with her in her loneliness, for not long after this parting scene her father breathed his last in his beloved woodland home, and is for ever dead to us i but to Helen, and in view of what she has to do, he is almost the all of life that stirs the pulses of her being. CHAPTER IV. HELEN  COURTENAY had many friends; their. name was legion; but she had no relations, no one who could presume by the right of blood to give her advice, or to. obtrude     36       HELEN COURTENA Y. into the still and darkened house where she sat brooding, ever brooding over her future, with a dogged perseverance which left her but little time for natural outhursts of sorrow. Her door was besieged by the curious and the interested, but to all she returned the same message of denial; they would have sympathized with her in the past, they would have condoled with the rich heiress of lands and gold, but how could they be expected to understand her poverty, or without an explanation to approve her future course, the reasons for which must for ever remain a mystery to all save herself. Thus a week passed, and yet another, until they who at first wondered at her total seclusion, grew cold and estranged, and soon found other objects to engage their attention; while a few, more faithful, were content to await her pleasure, feeling certain that she would in the course of time return with all the ardor of youth to her accustomed pleasures. Fortunately, Helen was not entirely alone in the solemn grandeur of her home; there was one with her-the nurse of her childhood, who, though she could not fathom the character and motives of the orphan girl, wept with her when she mourned, and was her counsellor as far as she would permit her to be, and between whom and Helen there was no common bond of affection. She was a white servant, who had devoted herself to the fortunes of the Courtenay family, and who loved her young mistress with a blind worship, which, though not wise, was at least comforting to Helen, who knew it to be sincere, and in her every thought of the future included her devoted attendant as her com- panion and friend. It was after several days of seclusion that Helen roused herself from her selfish and unavailing musings, and from her passive indifference to externals, to act. She had robed herself most willingly in the dress of mourning prepared for her, which seemed to her a most fitting habiliment, a type not only of her lonely state, but of the change that everything by which she was surrounded must likewise undergo; and she pressed the sable garments to her lips with reverential feelings, grateful that they secured her from the gaze of a curious world. They were like a veil   HELEN1 COURTENAA Y        3 which the young novice, already weary of the world, dons as she enters the sheltering convent gate. If anything could have assured Helen of the reality of her position, it would have been her reflected image as seen in the gorgeous mirrors that had so lately given back to her gaze a bright, laughing girl, clothed in garments as tasteful and as fanciful as fashion could devise, but now revealing her to herself as one whose sable-clad figure, bent head, and thoughtful face, had no place amid the brightness which surrounded her; it was as if among a gorgeous bank of sunset tints, when the skies were all aflame with the beauty of gold, and purple, and blue, a black cloud had suddenly appeared, floating over and around the brilliant pageant. After carefully reading the papers which her father had designated as being "private and important," her determi- nation was formed. There could be no shrinking from her duty, and what appeared to her to be that duty will be better revealed in her own soliloquy than in any second- hand report of another. Her judgment had matured; her power of thinking wisely had been forced into being by necessity and the outward pressure of circumstances, very much after the manner of the artificial growth of a hot- house plant; left alone in the wilds, beneath the -skies, and acted upon by natural rains and sunshine, it would have arrived at maturity in due time; but housed, warmed, and cultured, the germ had budded, leafed, and blossomed in a premature birth. "I must leave this house, it is clear," she said, with white face and blanched lips, while she pressed back the tears with trembling fingers; "I have wept enoughI have no right even to weep, since it helps to deter me from doing justice to another. I muatgiye up luxury, perhaps even comfort, from this time henceforth. I must dispose of books, pictures, furniture, and home. I must work, not only for my own maintenance, but to furnish the support of one who must never know the source whence it comes, because for him to know it would be almost to reveal my secret. Now that I have arrived at the age when my grandfather's bequest becomes strictly my own, I must have i     38       HELEN COURTENA Y. it invested iu such a way that it may yield more than in its  present unprofitable state. I must not even consider it as mine, but devote it all to one object-namely, to the accu- mulation of a certain amount, to be paid at a certain time to him whom I have helped, though most unconsciously, to defraud. I fear that my ideas upon the subject are not  yet all clear, but by patience and hope I expect to gain much. Of one thing I am convinced; I must find some one to advise me, some one with a clear head and a good judgment, to whom I can impart a portion, but not all, of my plans and difficulties. This seems to me of the highest .: importance, because it was one of my father's last thoughts, and while he was clothing it in words, his death-struggle came, thus depriving me of his own selection in the choice of a business friend. What makes this choice so difficult to me is, that I must be careful, even wh9n I am least reserved in my confidences, to keep pure the reputation of my erring but beloved parent." So thinking, so reasoning, Helen became more com- posed; the task seemed to her easier than at first, because she had brought the crude, tangled materials with which she had to work into something like order, at least in her own estimation, and with a lighter heart than she had borne since those death-struck eyes had looked upon her, she entered upon her life-mission. Simply informing her faithful and humble companion that during her father's lifetime they had exceeded their income by their extravagant style of living, land that it i devolved upon her now to support herself-- perhaps in a foreign land-she gave her the choice of remaining with her or leaving her; and Mary, with many tears and protes- tations of fidelity, accepted poverty with her young mistress in preference to plenty in the service of a wealthy employer. "And so," thought Helen, with something like a smile on her face, like sunshine on a barren and wintry moor, " after a all, I am not quite alone." Poor comfort for our petted  and pampered heroine; but we enjoy and suffer by contrast, and what yesterday may have been a-matter of indifference to us, becomes to-day a positive joy. The hungry man, in prosperity and plenty, scorns the crust which, shipwrecked ^sA:^^^^^^^^               i.   HELEN CG URTENA Y.        39 d on a desolate island, he accepts as the daintiest morsel, ver offered to mortal lips. Helen's next step was to search for the wise friend that he imaged to herself as coming to her assistance-one to whom she could tell something, yet not everything-a seer, et an automaton-a man of silence, yet a man of action- listener, yet not a questioner; and where could such a ombination of attributes be found? Then came bitter self- eproach that she had not employed those last pJcious ours in asking advice from her father; that she iad not iquired of him whom to trust. He evidently had some ne in his mind to fill the important place, and she had Ilowed him, by her own remissness, to delay a communi- ation so needed to the last, and then it was too late. tim, in her love, she readily excused; he knel he had blt brief hour to live; he had said all that the fleeting mo- nents allowed; he had had time only for retrospection, not or advice as to future conduct. She knew that there must we nice points about the matter, where some one skilled in he law would be her best adviser. -* Yes, that was clear; hen why not employ a lawyer; why not still retain that ndemonstrative, quiet personage who knew already more bout her father's affairs than any one, and who could nlighten her on many points about which she felt lament- bly ignorant? That was decided; she would send for im. And Helen could not have made a betterchoice. Stephen -erald, besides attending to all questions of litigation in the ]ourtenay family, on account of a slight service rendered to im by Helen's father in the early part of his career, took general interest in his employer's concerns, paying and eceiving money for him, while his wife attendell to those umerous commissions which those living in a city have it n their power to transact for their country friends. To describe Stephen Gerald's individuality would be imply to call him a conscientious lawyer, but our duty to lelen requires a few more' words; we must paint the man, nd give to his picture a frame, hanging it up in view in ather a prominent place upon the walls of our heroine's Louse of life.     40   v    HELEN COURTENA Y. He was a man of strict honesty, but so wrapt up in his profession that one might say in it .he only lived and breathed. It is true that he had a home where he eat, drank, and slept, and a wife; but the last he had taken unto himself because it was customary to marry, and, mar- riage was strictly a legal institution. It gave him a com- fortable refuge when he emerged at nightfall from his dingy business den; so comfortable, that he had nothing to do, no care to engage him, but the thought of those com- plicated cases which the morning hours were all too short to arrange, class, and settle. The aspect of. his house was as cheerful and pleasant as the wife whom he had chosen could make it; for her Quaker-like tastes admitted no orna- ments, no table with books and pretty trifles, but a rigid cleanliness pervaded the whole. Nor was it brightened by the faces of happy childhood. Had children come to him from his marriage, Stephen Gerald would have regarded them as so many weeds in the garden of existence; they interested him simply as heirs, issue, property-holders, and he cared for no relations with them except as being the guardian of their estates, or as his wards, whose interests had been committed to him in trust. And thus he and his placid-faced partner grew old and grey together, satisfied with themselves and each other, and contented in the thought that they were doing their duty in the sphere in which they had been placed by Providence. Helen's lawyer was a man of few words and fewer idle fancies; and when he came at her bidding and found himself seated opposite to her, he thought not of the impression which his keen grey eyes, erect position, and abrupt business manners had upon her, nor that they chilled her through and through at first like the sudden inlet of a gust of east wind. Nor did he think of the brilliant surroundings, except that they were the effects of a man lately dead, and that in all probability he had been sent for from New Orleans to arrange some transfer in the property, words the lawyer is accustomed to hear often, for in his vocation he daily sees the change from prosperity to adversity, and the reverse; he sees smiles in the morning in a newly enriched house- hold-in the evening a gloom of night over others, whom   HELEN JO URTENA Z        41 some peculiar Will-wording has bereft of their all.' What to him was that grand mansion, those rare pictures upon which it was a privilege of the connoisseur to look, tke dam- ask hangings, the curiosities from every land, the refine- ments ofwealth? Nothing; he was only a machine which the young heiress, Helen Courtenay, spinster, had thought fit to employ to do her work, in accordance he supposed with her late father's wishes, and because he held certain papers relating to the fortune of which she had just come into possession. "Thank you for your prompt attention to my wishes," said Helen, at length breaking the painful silence, and with a forced effort to be cheerful; "thank you, Mr. Gerald, I am glad to call you my friend; you were my father's friend," she added, with quivering lips and moistened eyes. "I trust," said the machine man, unmoved and .stolid, "that Mr. Courtenay ever found me punctual and exact in his business affairs, and that his daughter will find me the same."                    m Helen looked up suddenly into his face and brushed away her tears. On the whole she was glad that she found no sympathy there; it would have been as out of place as roses springing from the trunk of a decayed tree. He had come to advise, not to condole; and as she glanced again at his steel-cold eyes she felt that tears therein, and tears for her, would have been as strange as water gushing from a rock of flint. Unconsciously she assumed something of his attitude, sat erect, raised her regal head proudly, banished emotion, put away her girlhood from her, and tried to look what she felt that she ought then to be, the worldly woman. Ceasing to be natural, she acted a part, and was successful; a fact which she remembered well, and which in a great measure shaped her future course. Nor was this self-con- trol lost upon her companion. From the moment that he met her eye so composed, and felt the influence of her changed manner so possessed, he respected his client. "She suits me," he said to himself; " she understands what busi- ness is. She will let no weak tear-drops fall upon a last deed and testament; I like to dealtwith such as she." Scarcely had he time to arrive at this conclusion, when     42       HELEN COURTENA Y Helen spoke. Strange to say, she began where she thought to have ended il her planned programme, the result of sleepless nights; nor could she have commenced more effectually. It gave her confidence, it brought strength to her position. Her remark was a question. "In your vocation, per- haps you have often met with persons called, from certain peculiarities, eccentric?" "Such is not an unusual occurrence," he replied, be- trayed out of his stolidity of manner by a slight look of curiosity, and a gleam of light on his passionless face. "You see such a person before you," she continued, with as much calmness as though they, the asker and giver of advice, had changed places; "and this I tell you at the starting-point. Having read my grandfather's and father's papers with the earnest care and attention which they de- serve, I find that what I have always been taught to believe is an indisputable fact, namely, that I am heir to a con- siderable property which became mine on my eighteenth birthday, to give, to spend, or to will, as I think proper. I propose, if you feel so disposed, to have you continue in the daughter's as you lhave been in the father's employ, and to give you the management of my fortune for a time, with the usual percentage in such cases; feeling assured that I shall always be satisfied with the selection which I have made in a counsellor and a legal friend." Stephen Gerald acknowledged the compliment with something approaching to a bow; it was involuntary; a tribute to an individual sitting before him, whom in his mind he had confounded with his ideas of a crowned queen seated on her throne. "Before I proceed, however," said Helen, with a slight tremor in her tone, not more perceptible to the ear than the motion of a leaf touched by a zephyr to the eye, "I wish you to be kind enough to tell me if my father is in- debted to you for services in the past; also, whether he has left any other property about which it is my duty to inquire; or any debts which it would be best for me to pay prior to the formal announcement before the public, com- mon under such circumstances."   HE TLE COURTENAY.        43 Of Helen's three questions, only one was of vital im- portance to her; she had asked the others but to aid her to ask that; she longed, yet dreaded to hear, how much was known about her father's affairs. "Mr. Courtenay never allowed himself to acquire liabili- ties," was the answer; " he is in nothing indebted to my- self, and is, as far as I know, free from debt elsewhere. You, perhaps, are not aware that I have been intrusted with the collection of the interest and business relating to your property only; of course he has had other resources, for his expenditures must have far exceeded his income from your fortune; but with that fact I have nothing to do. He was scrupulously exact and just, and no doubt has a sche- dule of his property and means of support most system- atically drawn up for your inspection." Helen breathed more freely; she felt a delicious sense of relief; for not even did this mai of business have the slightest knowledge of her fathers delinquency, but he had called him exact and just. "Granting, for the sake of argument," she rettirned carelessly, " that your supposition is correct, and that my father had resources beyond the interest of my property, these resources must have failed him some time since. This house and what is contained therein constitute all the property which he has left, and in accordance with his will becomes mine. Now, though my income from my grandfather's estate will be far, far beyond my support, mark the first signs of my eccentricity; I propose to sell the house, grounds, furniture, and pictures, to the best ad- vantage; to give up all my servants, save one, and reside elsewhere-in what place or direction I have not as yet determined, but of that you shall in due time be advised." "Miss Courtenay must allow me to say," said Mr. Gerald, with increased gravity of manner, "that it would be best for her to find a home with one of her many friends, and to procure advice as to ahy further steps she may feel in- clined to take; this is the usual course adopted by orphan heiresses." "The usual course I shall not follow," said Helen de- cidedly, and with a slight degree of haughtiness and im-     "       HELEN CO URTEINA Y. patience; then desiring to end an interview which was *peculiarly trying to her, she continued, "I shall proceed to tell you briefly my plans. It is my wish that you invest my grandfather's property to the very best advantage, using every fair means to increase it, as I understand by reference to certain papers it lies almost idle in the hands of a manu- facturing company, where it has lain for years. Is it not possible, nay certain, by judicious management, investment, or even speculation, to double or treble the present divi- dends?" The lawyer's eyes brightened; though not exactly in his province, here Was an undertaking requiring judgment, skill, and tact. To engage in it, and with success, would repay the daughter the never-forgotten obligation owed to the father for his lindness to a once obscure and struggling practitioner. "Such a result were not impossible, but practicable," he answered, with slow deliberation. "Then," said Helen, eagerly, "I intrust the whole to you; bear the fact ever in mind, that I have no desire on earth so great as the increase of this inheritance. As for myself, by the sale which I mentioned to you, I expect not only to realize enough for my present wants but also to furnish you with the amount you are in the habit of forwarding yearly to an agent in Mobile, subject to the order of one-  " Helen drew a long breath, caught the outcom- ing syllables and held them, as it were, against the closed ivory portal whence they were issuing, dashing over her face a look of assurance, as an artist by a touch of his brash gives a desired expression to a portrait, then, gazing full into Stephen Gerald's eye, freed the imprisoned words, ' Edward Lee." "I was about to mention this very subject," answered the lawyer, with his usual calm utterance, quite unconscious of the fierce turmoil raging under the'placid exterior of his companion; "for I was aware, from what your father has told me, and from the punctuality with which he has ordered the sum to be forwarded to Mobile, that he did not like to omit this charity or trust, or whatever it may be, and that he had in some way bound himself andl!li heirs to be   HELEN COURTENAY.        45 responsible for the amount to young Lee until his twenty- eighth year; in fact, I have his written words upon the subject." "You are right," answered Helen, her pulse as calm now as an infant's; "the amount must be as regularly transmit- ted as ever; this you will be kind enough to attend to as well as to the arrangements for the sale, which I desire may be as private as possible. And now tell me," she asked, " is this all clear to you, Mr. Gerald? Being but lit- tle acquainted with business affairs, if I have failed to make myself understood, tell me so candidly, and I shall endeavor to be more explicit." "Nothing remains now," he answered, " but your signa- ture, empowering me to act for you; it will require but a short time to draw up a paper which, in a day or two, I will bring for you and your vouchers to sign. Our business for the present being concluded, I bid you good-morning." Helen extended her hand, and looked the thanks she did not know how to speak being uncertain how they would be received. In her soft yielding palm she felt his hand like a loose, hard wedge of iron, with not the slightest inclination of a pressure on his part. It chilled her; but she warmed again when thinking of the kind, honest heart with which it was connected. She had known a hand rose-lined and softer than Stephen Gerald's, with polished nail and fair exterior, as white almost as a woman's. It had caressed her and had been laid fondly on her head; she had pressed her lips upon it, and had often fallen asleep shielded by its protecting care, as though it had been a guardian angel. But the heart of him to whom the hand belonged! Ah! the thought was like a pang of physical pain: she was glad to be left once more alone. -  0- CHAPTER V. STEPHEN GERALD had departed, and Helen felt for a moment the weight upon her youth less heavy, because her     "       HELEN CO URTENA Y. responsibilities were, in a measure, shared with another. One step, and that an important one, had been achieved, and as she looked back upon it, its difficulties, once so imposing, dwindled into proportions of minor dimensions; she flattered herself that it had not cost her much of an effort, because it was simply a matter of words and an act of will; what remained was more difficult, and related to the affections; the parting with the servants who loved her so well; the giving up of the home which had so long sheltered her; the rupture of so many pleasant associa- tions; the severing of ties binding her to faithful friends. Then, too, the books she had read and marked must be sacrificed, and she must part with the pictures which had become companions to her, and the few exquisite and rare marble groups adorning their home; these and many other costly and cherished mementoes brought from foreign lands and woven into her life like a part of it, she must relinquish. True, they were hers, gifts from a parent to a child; she had a right to them, but, alas! they had been purchased with the wealth of another, and to that other, though in a different shape, they must be returned. Helen was fast losing her self-command; she felt unutter- ably lonely and forsaken; the pictured faces around seemed, too, to look sorrowfully down upon her; her brain was reeling; a mental burden was pressing upon her greater than she could bear. Every object seemed to speak to her regretfully; opposite to her hung a picture, an especial favorite of hers. It was a Spanish scene of gorgeous color- ing-evening skies all aglow with sunset hues; a cavalier reclined at the feet of his lady-love, a laughing beauty toy- ing with a guitar, and seemingly conscious of her power. The tints were superb, the figures almost like life; and Helen, in ller excited state, thought that she heard a low and musical laugh of scorn from the lips of the beautiful girl, while her handsome attendant whispered tauntingly: "We are not such favorites after all." Seeking to disen- chant herself from the cruel spell with which they had bound her, it was something like a relief to turn to a weep- ing Magdalen, into whose air and figure the artist, with ex- quisite skill, had thrown an expression of overwhelming grief.   HELEN COURTENAY.         47 "She will pity me," whispered Helen to herself; "she knows that I love her, that beautiful, sorrowing, and con- trite woman; " but even as she gazed the eyes of the figure seemed lifted to hers, and such a look of reproaph shone from beneath the long lashes, that Helen cowered among the cushions of a couch, and burst into a passion of tears. Her nerves were unstrung, she felt physically and mentally weak; a shape seemed to stand beside, her, tempting her to release herself by a strong effort from the bond which held her. "Of what use," it asked, "is this suffering,-this giving up of friends and household pleasures You are young, and fair, and wealthy; enjoy life; retrace your steps; use your wealth in your own behalf, and hoard it not for a stranger whom you have never seefi, and who has been defrauded of his rights by a course of action in which you have had no part. You are bound to no one living by a vow; what care you for the unconscious dead . " But Helen's only answerwas a continued fit of weeping which, in reality, was a benefit to her, for she had wept but little since her father's death; and Mary, in her search for her young mistress, found her with her flushed cheek upon the cushions, and the tears still streaming from her eyes. Had she a prophetic feeling that the young girl before her would not always have so soft and secure a resting- place, that she looked with such pitying eyes upon her? Perchance it might have been so, for the look of affection sees deeper into the heart than that of indifference, and sometimes reads the hidden secrets of 'futurity in the loved one's destiny. Unfortunately, though morality had been inculcated, the religious sentiment had never been developed in Helen. Had it been, she might have looked higher for comfort. She simply trusted to time, and habit, and new scenes, to blunt her present anguish, without a single thought of an overruling Providence. Nor is this to be wondered at when we reflect that her life had been all sunshine; that no misfortune had ever come to place itself. in contrast with her continued prosperity; and that she had received the pleasures, gifts, and happiness of her lot as a bird receives,     48       HELEN COURTENA Y. unconsciously, its food and shelter. She had prayed, but not with her soul; had attended church, but it was a me- chanical routine. Nor was it her fault that her heart had never owned a feeling of dependence upon the true source; the fault lay in her educators; they had been content, while the sunshine lasted, to let her bask in it unmindful of any coming storm. Helen's thoughts sometimes, but not often, turned to her cousin Frank Stoddard, now far away upon unknown seas. Our heroine in vain searched her heart for the deep emo- tion of love she knew she ought to entertain for one who, at some future day, would claim her as his wife-and why this was she could not herself determine. A higher law than that which bound her to him, she imagined, claimed her; a deeper sentiment than that of an indefinable emo- tion when thinking of him. Did she love him, or did she not? Alone in the world, Helen felt that she clung to him and his memory with a tenacity which was nearer affection than she had ever felt for any human being. Had he been close to her she could have wept in his arms and have looked for pity and sympathy from him ; it would have been a luxury to have cried herself to sleep, like a tired child, hushed by the sound of his soothing voice; but could she have asked counsel of him? No; that one crowning attri- bute of perfect love was wanting; she cared not to show him the secret depths of her heart. And yet she could not, dared not, shut him out for ever from her world. Alas, in this indecision, so common to the early years of woman, lie her ruth and ruin. Let her beware when she finds herself weighing and considering whether she loves him who woos her well enough to make it tolerable to spend her life with him; to be his in sickness and health, in pov- erty and riches; let her ask herself whether he could be to her the light of the home circle, the guide and exemplar of those whom a good God might send to brighten that charmed circle with their fresh and innocent love. Let-her think of him in the future, when his youth and hope shall be past and world-worn, grey'and anxious with many cares; he will have changed almost his identity. Will she love him then as now? Well may she pause at the momentous   HELEN 00CUTT  NA Y.       49 question, when looking around her at the fearful conse- quences of ill-assorted marriages, dawning seemingly b but over which at mid-day brods the dreary cloud of an incomplete passion. Let her love and trust fully and entirely, or love and trust not at 11. If her heart go not out to him at once, without any reserve, as a bird flies from the nest to its native air, let her pause and end the conflict of thought, nor force herself to an unnatural con- clusion. If she doubts, let her shut her eyes upon his fas- cinations, his wealth, his beauty; she had better live alone through the long years than experiment upon a thing so vital; she had better, with one strong, last effort, free her- self, than be cheated with that fatal wordperhaps. First, let her know and feel that he suits her in position, person, heart, mind, and soul, and then let her fearlessly give into his keeping the whole of her trusting self It was somewhat after this fashion that our heroine, like other mortals, fluctuated. She had a dread of wounding one who loved her so well by'entirely discarding him. Sometimes his absence was a relief, and the thought of her ever meeting him again, in the relation in which they stood, brought a sense of pain. Then came a revulsion of feeling; perhaps, in after years, when he returned and found her departed or occupying an obscure position, and no longer the heiress he had left her, he, in his turn, might desire that the tender passage enacted in their youth could be for ever forgotten. The thought stung her; it would be hu- miliating to be thus ignored. That reflection having passed away, a new train came; she felt rejoiced that she was not bound, but that their agreement, thanks to her father, was only conditional. Lastly, she drew with flushed cheek a glowing picture of his return, loaded with honors, high in position and fame, improved in appearance and character the very impersonation of manliness, far above her in men- tal strength, worthy the love of an empress, and seeking her, her alone, as his mate and peer. She was thrilled for an instant at the thought. But even in that case, what right would she have, she asked herself, to love him, to link her fate with his She was bound in another wav, the living to the dead; ghe would temporize, she would draw 3     50       HELEr C O URTENA Y. ideal pictures no more; she must blot out from her book of life the very name of love. Oh, the dreary, companion- less years before her! Oh, the toil, the anxiety, the self- abnegation, the nights of thought, the days of action, with no one near her to whom to whisper, "I am weary; " and to hear the sweet answer: "Trust and hope." These con- solations were not for her; she must bear her secret in patience and alone. Still another task remained for Helen, and it was no easy one for her to execute, but it clearly seemed her duty. It was to write a letter to Frank Stoddard, for Mr. Gerald to deliver to him, should he ever return to seek her. The letter was worded thus: "DEAR FRANK: "Since you and I parted, a terrible calamity has befallen me; my father has passed away. You have often called me in our sports a ' lawless child,' and I find that now, upon arriving at woman's estate, I deserve the epithet still. At first you will be surprised to hear that I have left my home and friends, but after you have thought well about the matter, you will conclude that there is truly nothing too eccentric for me to undertake. But trust me, Frank, my standard of right is very high, and I shall not stoop to do anything beneath it. When you left us, you said that you loved me; perhaps if we ever meet again that feeling will have died out, and given place to another of a different character. Perhaps you will love some one else. You are not bound to me, Frank, nor I to you; we are both free. I could never have made you happy; I am sure that you can find some one who will. God bless you, and farewell. "IIELEN." For many days Helen busied herself with preparations for her departure, and in the sale of her house and house- hold goods. In Stephen Gerald she found an ever-ready helper whose judgment was never at fault. Her personal friends, whom she now admitted to her presence, used every endeavor to persuade her to remain with them; but she pleaded, and without any untruth, a desire to visit   -HELEN COURTRE VA.         51 other scenes, and to be removed from associations which were most painful to her.      /           C Nor were there other friends of   different character wanting to induce her to remain in the home where she was loved so well. The young heiress had attractions too great to be allowed to pass away without an effort to retain them; and two admirers--the one of her fortune, the other of the fascinating child who had suddenly developed into a thoughtful and earnest woman-offered their hands and hearts to the young orphan. But Helen classed the one with the other; though they were both men of worth and standing, she scarcely gave them a thought; the idea of love seemed foreign to her when that of duty was so far above it, and she turned away bearing aloft "Her banner with a strange device," invisible to all save herself, and planted her foot firmly in the path which led upwards towards dreary and snow-clad heights. After all was over- the sale; the desecration of objects she loved bythe gaze of a common crowd; the valuation in dollars and cents of what was to her above all value; the parting with her books, those quiet but dear friends of solitude; the easy-chair by the sunset window, where, hidden like a hermit, she had dreamed happy   dreams, or read, or watched the shadows of the departing day, or the beauties of Ahe star-lit night; where she had been mirthful with gay friends, or sorrowful with sorrowing  ones; when she had, said "good-by"  to those faithful domestics who had served her so zealously, to whom she had been a queen, but a gracious one, enthroned above them, yet looking ever kindly upon their attempts to do her bidding; when she had wept passionate tears of regret at the severance of the ties of friendship, never more strong than in the heart of sunny girlhood; when through falling tears she saw how much love she was forsaking, and when a monitor whispered warningly to her, as she for a moment faltered in the way, "Do you count it more than the honor of your father?" she meekly took her staff and departed to find another asylum upon distant shores, while the sighing of the winds and the restless beat of the ocean waves seemed to murmur in their unrest for ever and for ever to the pilgrim child: " Whither, whither at last?"     52       HELEN COURTENA Y. 1;   CCHAPTER VI. ALLAN COURTENAY spoke the truth on his death-bed when he said that his neglected ward was employing his time to advantage. He had entered college after careful prepara- tion, and having completed his academic course with honor, had commenced the stndy of law in the city of New Orleans, an occupation not particularly suited to his talents, but agreeing best with his literary tastes. His passion was for scientific pursuits; but knowing the expense of a laboratory and a chemist's requirements, he relin- quished for the present his favorite idea, and realizing that he must depend upon his own exertions for a support, applied himself to the arduous work of studying his pro- fession with an earnest desire to gain both a fortune and fame at some future time. He knew little or nothing of his father, who had died in his childhood; the only link binding them together was a letter written to his son im- mediately before his death, which Edward had ever kept in his possession as a precious legacy of affection. The language of this missive was chaste and beautiful, the love ardent, and the interest expressed in his son's integrity and success in life intense. After pages of affectionate advice, which Edward knew by heart, he concluded by telling him of the stated sum which would be paid him until his twenty-eighth year; after that time, he added, he should like the same sum devoted to charity, to some struggling student or penniless widow; and that the person who had charge of the principal would hand it over to him then. This arrangemcnt was made, he wrote, presupposing that his s n had realized enough for his own support at the specified period, or had a prospect of so doing. Edward Lee had come from his college shelter into a crowded city without friends; but letters from the pro- fessors, who appreciated his brilliant intellect and rare energy of character, soon secured for him occupation and a home; and Mr. Woodburn, his employer, congratulated himself upon so valuable an acquisition to his office. The young law student did not at once see that the   HELEN CO URTEVA Y.       53 jurist under whose roof he was domiciled was narrow- minded and calculating, not being aware of the value of his own services, and for some time he rejoiced that he was allowed so many opportunities for advancement in the profession to which he was devoting himself; but before a long time elapsed a chain of circumstances enlightened him as to the character of the lawyer. Mr. Woodburn soon found that his was no ordinary mind, and that the young man who so faithfully did his bidding would sooner or later rise to eminence. He saw that points which required from the other students close application, were comprehended by Lee at a glance, and he found himself unconsciously asking his opiiqion in regard to difficult positions in law cases, or requiring Edward to write statements of his own convictions, which he often appropriated as originating from himself. Mingled with this feeling of Lee's supremacy was one of jealousy, which had taken possession of his mind be- cause he perceived that the circle gathered in his. office were cognizant of the state of the case. Edward's situa- tion, therefore, was by no means a comfortable one; blit, friendless and in a strange place, he knew not to whom to appeal for counsel, and concluded not to change his con- dition until he had gained a position by perseverance 'and study, deeming it best to endure, at least for a time, those evils which he could not cure; and thus he decided to re- main passive. Allan Courtenay, as the reader is partially aware, had never showed any interest in his friend's son, or an appeal to him would have remedied his disagreeable position; the regularly transmitted sum, sent through an agent, who was drawn upon for all of Edward Lee's bills, had been all the bond between them; nor did Edward ever have the curiosity to inquire who held the principal of his little income, the payment of it having been such a mere form from his earliest childhood. As the matter stood, Courte- nay himself was most desirous to keep in the background, having no anxiety whatever to be upon terms of friend- ship or intimacy with one upon whom he had committed so great a fraud.     54        HELENV COURTENA Y. Mr. Woodburn's chief characteristic was suspicion. He suspected even those who were bound to him by ties of love, perhaps coloring their characters with the darker shades of his own, and judging others by himself. He suspected his friends of hypocrisy, his family of mean motives, his fellow-lawyers of deception. That there could be so fair a thing as a true and honest man did not enter into his imagination; and though he, after all, was the worst sufferer by this miserable state of feeling, he caused much misery in consequence to others, and most effectually decided Edward Lee's destiny. One afternoon, Mr. Woodburn having received a consider- able sum of money, was suddenly called from the office, leaving a roll of bills upon his desk. He was unavoidably absent for some time, and upon his return the money was nowhere to be found.  Disappointed and enraged, with his old habit of suspicion strong upon him, in an unguarded moment he charged Edward Lee, who was alone in the apartment when he reentered, with the theft. Thus accused, the young man, stung to the soul by the cruel charge, knew for the first time in his life the might of genuine anger; the purple veins swelled upon his brow, and his clenched hand burned to strike a blow which would still that lying voice for ever; but his better nature pre- vailed, the look that he gave his accuser establishing his innocence more surely than a death-stroke would have done. It was not scorn, nor was it pity; an observer would not have said that it meant abuse of another in a phrase like this, "You see that vile, mistaken wretch, accusing me of dishonesty;" nor could the interpretation have been: "Poor fool, he thinks to soil the whiteness of my soul." There was simply a sublime seal of innocence upon his face and upon his whole bearing, having no dual meaning in a reference to another, but only concerning himself. He would have scorned exculpation; that would have been to stoop; and yet the internal conflict was crowned with per- fect success, the success of silence, but leaving its life- mark upon his soul. He spoke no word, because he feared that the uttering of a single syllable might be a curse on that grey head; he kept his clenched hand resolutely by   HELEN CO URTENA .         55 his side, dreading that a revengeful thought might have acted upon it as a touch upon the trigger of a deadly weapon; he walked the floor with heavy tramp, feeling that some counteraction was required to keep'the hot blood tame; the pulsations of his heart were doubled, and his breath came like a hiss through his closed lips. The words, "You have appropriated that money," seemed echoed and reechoed until they reached the skies; the waves of sound, to his excited mind, spread them world-wide, and not a creature breathed but had heard the stigma--thief: and yet those white locks were spared the desecration of a blow; the heart that conceived so foul a thought still beat with life; but the man's soul was humiliated, his power over Edward Lee had departed, and the youthful student stood before the experienced practitioner and worldly-wise lawyer, the master mind. Let us thank God for the privilege of silence. Men pray for the gift of speech; let us rather pray for that other, for speech is silver, but silence is golden: "Even were it true, why say it? What will be the end, the gain? Waves may murmur, thunders roll, Silence is the only answer of a self-collected soul." Mr. Woodburn, with cringing attitude and averted eyes which dared not encounter his companion's fearless, inno- cent look, was about to apologize; to take back his foul words, to say (most pitiful compensation for a slander such as that) that he was sorry for what had occurred, when his brother entered all unconscious of the storm he had helped to  raise. He had come to say that seeing a roll of money left carelessly upon the desk, he had taken it upon himself to place it away securely, and now desired to re- store it to its owner. That the money had been lost and found   again, did not in the least affect Edward Lee; it was the degradation that his soul felt. He longed for the fresh air of heaven, some- thing purer   than the poisoned atmosphere in which he found it difficult to exist; and leaving the apartment, he sought the cooling breath of evening.     56       HELEN COUR TENA Y. It was twilight, that season of all others when the spell of quiet is upon the earth; when a lull comes between the sounds of daylight and the sounds of night. It was that hour which, in the home circle, is given to contemplation, and busy memories of the dead and absent take the place of speech, and make the air around holy with silence; when the children's little hands are folded and their prattle stilled, because they have learned the trick of thought from their elders, recognising the uplifted finger and softly- breathed " hush!" as symbols meaning that they must be mute until the lamplight comes to break the mystic though invisible thread stretching from the sun's last rays to the drooping of the curtain of night. It is the time when the smith leaves his anvil, the merchant his ledger, the printer his press, and the reader his book, looking skyward to catch a glimpse of the first tremulous star in the heavens, the legible writing of the Creator's hand; when in the fields the cattle are housed, the sound of the scythe is hushed, the earth is shadowless, while the very breeze has died into stillness, and Nature herself seems asleep. It was at this period, so calm and consecrated, the sab- bath of the day, that Edward Lee found himself in the lately busy streets of a great city, quiet only by comparison with what the meridian had been; for though the crowd were hurrying on, the spell of twilight was upon them, their eyes looked homeward, and in their hearts there was a foretaste of rest. To Edward Lee the mechanical act of walking and of meeting others of his kind was annoying; he longed for wings to fly on, on, anywhere beyond the region of thought; and in this feverish state of mind, scarcely heeding dis- tances and not caring whither he went, he found that he had traversed a considerable space beyond the usual thorough- fares of the city, while he noticed that the night had set in with clouds and unusual darkness. He soon became conscious, by the increased freshness of the wind, that he was approaching the water, and concluded that he must be in the neighborhood of the wharves, then destitute of the life and activity now characterizing them. He was refreshed with the cool stream of air that blew upon his heated brow,   I1ELEN CO UR TELVNA       5 and folding his arms and leaning against a gateway, which was recessed from observation had there been any one to notice him, resigned himself to whatever mood of thought might come to him, somewhat as a shipwrecked man de- spairingly gives himself up to the power of the waves. The night was superb in its wild grandeur; dark, heavy clouds, fringed with a line of light, hurried by as though bent on some gloomy message of woe; the winds moaned like human creatures in agony, and the waves dashed drearily against their restraining boundaries. Yet, though heaven and earth teemed with melancholy influeAces, the self-banished youth in his sheltered resting-place felt not in its true force the dread gloom of the hour. True, he was homeless, friendless, and with no prospect of a future sup- port, for he realized in his inmost soul that he never could return to his late employer's roof; and yet he was happier- than he had ever been while there. His first thought was one of bitterness as he recalled the events of the past few hours, the conviction forcing itself upon him for an instant that he was an outcast, but it was only for an instant; his manhood asserted itself, and with the world before him, hre rejoiced in his freedom and in his integrity. A chilling blast sweeping by somewhat lowered the high- flown tone of thought in which he was indulging, and urged upon him the necessity of seeking a shelter for the night. But where? He turned to examine the character of the place in which he had found a temporary refuge; but hearing voices near, and not caring to intrude upon any one or to be intruded upon, withdrew more completely into the shadow. The first words which he heard arrested his attention. They were these: "But what if it were to end in murder?" "Then let it be so," said another voice; "the shedding of blood should not stand in the way of gold. Come' Our way is clear; the vessel beating into port all day proves to be a merchant bark from Brazil. That sort of craft always brings home adventurers with coffers filled with diamonds mostly, the better for us; for what is most con- venient for them in the shape of wealth, will be most con- venient for us to take away. Our next step will be to mark 3*     5 8       IELE. COURTENA! Y. our game among the passengers-some old anxious-looking man; you know the signs." There was some show of remonstrance in the words of the other party; and then as if all objections were overruled, two men walked hurriedly by Edward, while he followed as near as he could without exposing himself to detection, hoping to be able to trace and identify them. What they contemplated doing must be prevented, but it was not yet clear to him how it could be done, so great an uncertainty enveloped the whole matter. Unfortunately there were no police within call, and he felt that it would be madness, without weapons of any kind, to confront two unknown an- tagonists upon so vague a charge as he could institute against them. While he was meditating upon the best course for their arrest, they quickly turned a corner of the street, and upon following them he found himself in a crowd which was gathered around a vessel that had just reached her moorings. As he had no interest in the new arrival, and had lost sight of those whom he was following, he related to a policeman the conversation he had heard, warning him to be on his guard, as there was evidently a deed of blood to be committed that night. Unfortunately Edward could not describe the appearance of the suspected assassins, for the night was so dark that he had only seen the outline of their figures as they moved away, and had noticed that they avoided as much as possible the street lamps in their path. After hearing that the vessel was really from the diamond coast, and watching for a moment the curious assemblage of uncouth-looking people who emerged from the deck, he turned his steps away, determining to repair to the nearest hotel presenting itself, and defer any plans for his future until the next morning. The way which he unconsciously chose was a lane rather than a frequented street, and so silent and undisturbed was it, that the tramp of his own footsteps was all the sound that he heard. But before many minutes he distinctly recognised the noise of wheels not far distant; then a sudden cessation of the motion, and a stifled cry for help. Quickly retracing his steps, he soon reached the spot whence the   HELEN .CO UR TENA Y.      59 sound had proceeded. His eye took in the whole scene at a glance and read its meaning. A lad, probably an accomplice of the ruffians, sat trembling upon the box of a carriage, seemingly without any other disposition or pur- pose than to govern the horses which he had been ordered to stop. Upon the pavement stood a man with great diffi- culty trying to lift two huge packages upon his shoulders, cursing, yet exulting, over their weight. But Edward judged rightly when he concluded that from him could not have come that heart-piercing cry for help; and without a moment's hesitation, and with a prolonged call for assist- ance, he rushed towards the door of the coach with the gene- rous impulse, even at the risk of his own life, to save the life of another. There was no time for thought, however, but only for action, when he found himself breast to breast with an experienced ruffian in a contest for life or death; while quite insensible upon the seat of the carriage, lay an old, grey- headed man. Edward would soon have been overpowered in the strug- gle, which was fierce and furious on both sides, but in which his antagonist, from superior strength and practice, evidently had the advantage; when, in an effort of the rob- ber to draw a pistol from his breast, it was'accidentally dis- charged, the contents lodging in his own right shoulder. With a cry of madness he flung himself upon his opponent, but it was too late for victory; for his strength suddenly failed him and he fainted, only to be transferred into the hands of the police who now gathered in numbers to the spot, while his companion, hearing approaching steps, pru- dently absconded without the coveted booty, for which he had risked so much. Theirs was a bold plan, and would no doubt have succeeded but for Edward's timely interference, for they had beguiled a solitary and unwary traveller into a coach of their own ; the driver was leagued with them; the treasure hady been almost secured, when the frantic cry of the struggling old man about to be murdered materially changed the fate of all concerned in the drama of the night. The poor voyager was soon aroused to consciousness, but     60       HELEN COURTEN AYU  in the struggle he had sustained a severe blow upon his head, which made him feel incapable of acting or thinking; and Edward, who now felt some responsibility for the fiu- ture welfare of one whose life he had saved, found himself called upon to act for his almost helpless charge. With many soothing words he acquainted the wounded man with his desire to serve him; and accompanying him to a hotel, sent at once for a physician, and constituted himself watch- er and nurse for the remainder of the night. There was a singular mixture of reserve and confidence in the stranger, a mingling of child-like simplicity and trust with a leaven of caution, which interested Edward in spite of himself, and drew him nearer to study the cha- racter so singularly placed open to his inspection; while, as the cloud of pain and fright gradually rolled away from the brain of the patient, he found that he was an intellig'ent and educated man. The night was spent, on the invalid's part, in intervals of conversation and sleep, Edward sitting by his side, or at- tending to his wants with unwearied patience that was received with grateful courtesy. At length the morning dawned, and a warm friendship, born of good offices and kind words, had already sprung up between the two men whose meeting had been so eventful and unexpected. But the new day brought Edward Lee's hour of departure, for he felt that he could not afford to be idle; and his friendless condition impressed him in its full force, when he reflected that he had but little money at command, his invest- ment in law books being something of an item in his in- come. In that lonely night-watch he had drawn an outline of his plans; and it was his intention, after securing the comfort of Mr. Drayton, his new friend, to go in quest of employment. But an unforeseen difficulty arose; the latter appeared unwilling to part with him, and the effect of his last night's adventure had so shaken his strong frame, that the physi- cian informed him his chief need was cheerful companion- ship, and that he must on no aceoint be left alone. Beingr thus hard pressed, Edward was forced to tell him his story, and ended by asking him if he blamed him for desiring to   HELE N CO URTENA E        61 exert himself to gain a livelihood, and to earn the bread upon which his very existence depended. His bright truthful face, his earnest words, his proud look of perfect integrity were not lost upon one who had studied human nature in its myriad phases; and after his touching and graphic picture, the stranger fell to musing, and was silent so long that Edward became impatient to end his reverie and to bid him farewell. At last, however, Mr. Drayton spoke; neither his manner nor his appearance was entirely polished; they resembled rather those of a man who has seen better days, and with whom some of the graces of prosperity and society yet re- mained. Nor was his dress calculated to lend elegance to his appearance, for it was simple and coarse in the extreme. And yet this man had about him, in Edward's eyes, an air of conscious strength; and he felt that, even in his quaint garb, he must command entire respect in any situation in life. "You have told me your story, young man," he said, "and now you must patiently listen to mine. We are both solitary; but here the similarity of our cases ends. You are poor, I am rich. I left these shores some ten years ago, impoverished in purse by a course of reckless extra- vagance which had wasted a fair patrimony, to endeavor to rebuild my fortunes. I had, besides a brother and his family, but one tie in the world, my little son-a precious legacy from his dying mother. Upon this child I centred all my hopes; him I took with me on my long pilgrimage; for his sake I exiled myself from my ftiends and my native land, relinquishing all the refinements of life and the charms of society that a man of cultivated tastes appre- ciates so truly. Certainly my hardships were great, but my rewards abundant; for I garnered enough wealth to make me the envy of my neighbors, who. wondered -at my luck; but who did not reflect that, after all, perseverance and unre- mitting toil were the chief agents in my success. You can easily imagine that my time was fully occupied, when I tell you that, added to my life of labor, I was the sole instruc- tor of my boy." The narrator paused so long at this point in his story,     62       HELEN COURTENVA Y that Edward feared a revival of the faintness which had attacked him several times during the night; but as he was about to offer him a restorative, Mr. Drayton con- tinued: "Just as I was about to return to this country, and in the prime of his early manhood, my son died-my son died. Tlose three words relate to you a fact, and you hear it, naturally, with aboit the same degree of emotion with which you would hear of the death of any other stranger; but to me, young man, the bare thought is like a knife cut- ting at my heart, wounding, lacerating, probing until I seem to have no other sensation left but a sense of acute suffering. DeathI O God, it is a fearful thing; the physi- cal pain of the dying, the farewell, the beautiful form stiff and inanimate; the eyes, those wonderful intelligences through which the spirit shines, closed for ever with marble lids and looking love no more; the lips, once smiling so be- nignly and uttering tones of affection that change this dreary life-road into a paradise, portals through which pass words of comfort and hope, making men better and braver for the hearing, hushed; those clasped hands,.once so ready to give pressure for pressure to beloved ones, ice-cold; then the stillness that falls upon the spirit like the tangible weight of a heavy hand upon your heart; the craving want of something lost for ever and for ever; the cheating hope that, after all, it may only be a dream; the discordant mirth of those who know not or cannot sympathize with your bereavement; the restless nights, with that strange dizzy awaking to a reality which you cannot make true, until you go through a certain minute process of reasoning with mathematical precision, recalling the very act of death which you have seen, and which you long, beyond expres- sion, to forget; then the dreary day, when the sunshine is so bright and joyous upon the new-made grave that it seems sent to mock you with its unusual radiance, or the rain coming down hard, cold, and pitiless, upon the freshy heaped mound; next, that hardest, hardest part of all, the learning to live without one who has been the all of your world, for which you have cared to exist; the change of your train of thought, substituting for 'Us' a miserable,   IIELEN COURTEYAZ  .       603 s lfish 'me;' the foolish fancy that you hear his voice call- ing upon you, or that you detect his footsteps coming to meet you; the sight of those things that personally be- longed to the lost one, which to keep in sight is a continual reopening of your wound, and yet to give or to put away for ever, a trial almost beyond your strengthin in a word to sum up all, the terrific blank in life that affrights you with its horrible meaning and its eternal wail, beating on your heart with the mournful murmur of waves upon a lonely strand. No more, no more.-- My young friendcmy son died.;. He fell a sacrifice to the fearful fever that rages with great violence at certain seasons of the year in those treacherous climes. It was at the time when the sunshine was most brilliant, the fields a living green, and what we call exotics here blooming like flowers of the wild; when the nights were like the nights of a dream, and the moon shed floods of silver on the beautiful earth and lit up plain and river as with a glow from fairy-land. But to breathe the air of those enchanted nights is to antedate one's death; there is a fatal power beneath its bluest skies that steals away health and strength and life; like the kiss of a frail but beautiful woman, it poisons while it thrills. The fever caught and wrestled with my child like an invisible antago- nist; sometimes almost conquering its foe, sometimes seem- ingly being conquered. Strange to say, I often found my- self watching the case with the curiosity of a philosopher, reasoning about origin, causes, decay; or I seemed to my- self to be a spectator at some ancient gladiatorial show, where human life was a kind of plaything; sometimes I likened the progress of the malady to the growth of a flower, and wondered if the same God planned them both. The fever lasted long, ah, cruelly long, I thought; and I was subjected during its continuance to alternate hope and despair, for it ebbed and flowed like a tide, or brightened - and paled like a- sunset; sometimes he seemed gone for ever, shadowy and wan, and then he flushed as it were back into life. I spare you the details of the precise mo- ment and manner of his dissolution, when the triumphant gladiator, after his fiercely contested fight, forced the death- rattle from the throat of his antagonist, who seemed so loath     "       HELEV  CO URZTENA Y to relinquish his life, which, as it were, had but just begun; when the bud fell, with a worm at the heart of its tender, crimson leaves; when the tide ebbed to flow not again, and the sunset faded never more to brighten my desolate world. His sufferings were terrible for him to bear and for me to witness, nor have I the courage or inclination to recall them; should I do so, you would witness regret so fierce in its character, sorrow so deep, and rebellion to God's will so unchristian, that I fear I should lose in your eyes just what I most desire to retain-your esteem. It is enough to say that when he was wrenched from life by the strong hand of fate, he was noble, manly, and talented, my pride and my joy. I had amassed wealth, but what was life with- out lis smile of affection? Positively nothing. I could willingly have lain by his side, quite content with the ex- change from a burdensome existence; but God decreed other- wise. Perhaps He has mercifully spared me that I may en- courage a better frame of mind; but with that dogged indiffer- ence to life, you can imagine with what feelings I looked for- ward to a return home, a thought that had heretofore been like a blessed land of promise to a wearied pilgrim. My work was finished-my double work; I had gained what I had toiled for, and had made my loved one's grave, with the eter- nal stars his monument, flowers for his headstone, flowers at his feet; and leaving him in the golden land where he fell, as a soldier is buried where he dies, I mechanically went on board the vessel which was to convey us-no, I forget, to convey me home. During the voyage I was affected with a fearful kind of stupor that deprived me of memory and hope; and when at the wharf, upon our arrival here, some one kindly offered to take charge of me and my boxes, upon which, however, knowing them to be valuable, with the mere force of old habit I kept my eyes; without ques- tion I accepted the offer, and did as I was directed by a man who procured a carriage for me, and who gave his own directions to the coachman. You know the rest bet- ter than I do; you remember, but for your timely inter- ference in exposing your life for mine I should have been cruelly murdered; you know with what kind feelings you conducted a friendless old man hither, passing your night   HELEN COUR TEVA Y.        65 in watching him, although he, too, was watching you with- out your being aware of it. And in that close scrutiny of his he saw upon your face marks of recent trouble, like the agitation of the waves after the storm has lulled; he knew that there was not entire peace within, but as certain was he that it was not the unrest of a troubled conscience; then, by that peculiar bopd which attracts suffering man to man, knitting their hearts insensibly together, he felt that in some such manner, they-the old life-worn traveller and the fresh, brave soul-were bound together. Young man, we part not thus. Call me strange, fanciful, if you will-I am both, I confess it; for so long a residence in a land almost without law has made me so. Occupy the place of my lost child; bear my name .as he did; take care of me; teach me the ways of this new world, so different from the one that I have left; bear with me a little while-ah, yes, only a little while, I trust; and when I depart to join him who will thank you for your care of his old father, take the fortune which was to have been his and use it as nobly as I am sure he would have done." Tears were streaming down the furrowed cheeks of the bereaved parent; his arms were extended as though asking for help; his voice had the beseeching tone of prayer. It was a mnoment of intense interest to both. Iomeless, friendless, what remained for Edward Lee but to accept so kind and generous an offer, and one seemingly sent espe- cially to him in the darkest hour of his life? And yet he felt its great responsibilities, and was silent after the utter- ance of so touching an appeal. What was his duty?  That, after all, was the grand question to be answered. That very hour would shape his whole future. The conviction made him pale and trem- bling. He became literally a coward, afraid to lean one way or the other; he thought that his judgment had for- saken him, and pressing his hand over his eyes, tried to shut out everything external, and to force his thoughts into subjection. He prayed for guidance, he yearned for second sight to lift the curtain from the hidden years; one voice seemed to say: "Help thyself; owe thy fortune to no other man." Another voice uttered as loudly: "Disdain     "       HELEN COURTENA . not to be helped." His brain was in a strange whirl; seconds, minutes were passing rapidly, when at last a faint sigh from the patient old man who was awaiting the result of his reverie decided his fate. There is an acknowledged might in the machinery of words, the whisper of love, the trumpet-sound of command, the orator's persuasive accents; but can they surpass the eloquence of signs? A woman's most potent weapon is a tear; the upraised arm of a warrior pointing onward has led whole legions to victory or death; a monarch's frown is ofttimes the signal for a subject's fall; the bended knee is in itself a prayer; a smile, a poet tells us, is "worth a world;" and yet another of sainted memory, when writing of the influence of a sigh, a smile, and a tear, has set his beautiful thoughts to the music of rhythm, in the following exquisite stanza: Who did not understand and love her, With meaning thus o'erfraught; Though silent as the sky above her, Like that, she kindled thought." Hamlet's ghost beckoning with uplifted finger is a picture that clings to the memory with peculiar tenacity; the cross displayed to a dying man, assures him of a pardoning love; and above all other signs, how solemn, how heart-searching was the look bestowed upon the guilty disciple of the Saviour, sinking deeper into his soul than a torrent of accusing speech. There was a striking significance in Mr. Drayton's sigh; it told of suffering and weariness, and asked for sympathy and pity in return, thus changing the whole current of Edward Lee's thoughts. Was there any reason why he should not accept that kind offer? His conscience showed him none. Then what a life of freedom wa. open to him! Wealth would be at his command; he would no longer be thwarted in his pecu- liar tastes, but at liberty to seek a path to distinction in his own way. lie would no longer be trammelled with the curse of poverty; but work, and rest from working, with proper relaxation 1 his bodily frame. Then, again, his   HELEN COURTENA.. 6A7 reasons for accepting that bright fate need not be entirely selfish; here was a man to whom he could supply a loss, smoothing his path to the grave, while he leant in weakness upon his strong, young arm; he would be of some use in the world, where so many were drones and useless. How sweet the privilege of doing good! He had resolved- there was no parade in the contract attending the new life- league; his upraised eyes met with a bright, clear look of confidence, the searching gaze that had never been taken from him. "You will come to cheer an old man's last days " said Mr. Drayton. "I will come," was the quiet answer. Then two hands pressed each other in a cordial grasp- the one firm with the pulse of youth, the other trembling with the decay of age. The tears a while ago glistening in the old man's eyes were dried, and a smile like a bow of promise circled around his lips. Edward smoothed his pillow with a woman's tenderness, while his silvered head sank upon it, and he heard him murmur shftly: "I thought I had forgotten how to smile. Ah, well, well!" So say- ing, the weary life-traveller, with a heart more full of con- tent than he had known for many, many days, fell serenely into a child-like sleep. CHAPTER VII. WHEN Mr. Drayton awoke from his calm untroubled sleep, his brain was clear, his judgment good, while he entered into the formalities of certain business relations with exact- ness and recision. First he stipulated that the contract just entered into should assume that he was the parent of Edward l]ee in authority; secondly, that Edward should always ad ress him by the appellation of father; thirdly, that he was not to discourage the idea that he was Mr. Drayton's     68       IIELEY COURTENAY  son, although he should not violate the truth in so doing, with the understanding, however, that at the death of his adopted parent he was absolved from all obligations of the kind. Then, with characteristic promptness, he drew up a will, attested with proper signatures, in which he made Edward, or as we shall now call him, Herbert Drayton, his sole heir. This being accomplished, as Herbert was now provided for, he advised him not to draw upon his Mobile agent until their return from Europe, where he expected to go in a few days to join his brother, who was travelling with his family; they, of course, were to be informed of his son's death, and his adoption of one who would take tlhe place of his lost child. Next he sent to the lawyer, Mr. Woodburn, for his late clerk's little stock of posses- sions, without any reference to his change of name or des- tination, and this completed their arrangements. It was with a beating heart, and strange, dream-like sen- sations, that our hero, for such he is, found himself in the early part of the present century, and not long after the events recorded above, with a new name and under new relations, the ocean beneath him and the blue heavens over- !lead, journieying towards another and distant land-a la/nd which, even in his wildest aspirations, he had scarcely hoped ever to reach. With his exquisite tastes and high appreciation of what was beautiful in nature and art, he felt that to have the Old World open to his view would be to enjoy life in its fullest sense. The thought gave a new de- light and meaning to hope, the realization of which would enrich memory a thousandfold. The vessel, for it w-as before the days of steam, was crowded with passengers; a motley ship's company of all names and nations, with interests as varied as their names. A blue sky, fair winds, and brilliant sunshine attended them as they left port; but like many another morning vision, the morrow found it clouded and dark. More than midway upon their ocean path a terrible storm overtook them, and fear and a common danger, which so soon unite strangers, in many cases broke down the barrier of reserve. Numbers of the passengers were too ill to take an interest in the fear- ful progress of the storm; some displayed an apathy which.   "ELEN COURTEA Y.        69 standing as they were on the brink of destruction, was frightful to behold; some were engaged in games of chance; while others, with benevolent care, gave their attention to those who needed it, and endeavored, though hopeless them- selves, with hopeful words to lighten the gloom that hung around. A few, either from illness or desire for retirement, had not left their state-rooms during the whole voyage. Among the latter class were a young girl and her attendant, who had been placed under the fatherly care of the captain by a quiet and respectable old gentleman. One night near a dangerous locality, and in the midst of that fierce conflict of the elements, there was a comparative lull. It was a deceitful pause, however; for like wild beasts of prey they toyed with their victims ere they made the final effort to destroy. The passengers were mostly in their state-rooms or the cabin, employed according to their taste or inclinations. Many were on their knees in prayer; some so deeply engaged in cards, that one would have thought that life or death hung upon the issue of the game; while others were sleeping as securely as though they were infants cradled in a quiet home. In this pause of the storm, the captain descended the stairs of the cabin, looked for a moment around, and then towards the door where his young charge and her compa- nion were domiciled. For some time he had been unable to do aught for her comfort or cheer, and he had come for the purpose of saying a few words of encourage nt to the unprotected girl. She was standing at the half-open door of her state-room, and her eyes, peering into the dimly- lighted room as she heard the voice of the captain, flung athwart the twilight gloom such an earnest look of entreaty, that their glance, so imploring, made him hasten to her side.  "I can spare a moment, but a mnment," he said, approach- ing, "to see how my young charge weathers this fearful storm. I must greet you and say 'good-by' in the same breath. In any event you must try to be self-possessed and calmhn." "Does it rain." she asked, without heeding his kind words. -     70       IIELENV COURTENVA Y. "No," he answered, "not just now; but it will come down in torrents before many hours." "Then, since it does not rain now," she said, "you must take me with you, if but for an instant, to look upon the night. I am weary with this close, confined air; I pine for the fresh breath of heaven." "That is impossible," he said, decidedly; "the deck to- night is scarcely a place for a courageous man, far less for a timid, frightened woman." "See," she answered, holding out both her hands, "I am not trembling, neither am I timid or frightened; only take me for a little while." He turned away with a negative on his lips; but as he turned, she laid her delicate hand on his roughly clad arm and detained him. "You know you promised to be kind to me as well as careful. Is this kindness, captain?" she asked. She raised her eyes to his with the action of a spoiled child. His thoughts wandered to his far off home, and he remembered his own dear ones there; he remembered his daughter, like Helen, just budding into womanhood. He was tender-hearted, though so brave. He had forbidden her to come; she had heard it, but that did not deter her from her purpose. She saw that he was relenting, and thanking him before he had granted her request, stood by his side with shawl, scarf, and hood, ready to accompany him. With an ex- clamation of impatience, and a few words not very compli- mentary concerning the obstinacy of her sex, he suffered Helen to cling to his arm for a support, and so ascended to the deck. The place to which he led her was comparatively secure; a recess formed by a projection of the upper deck, which was supported by slight columns. The free, fresh air re- vived her, and made her feel, in contrast with the close confinement of the past, as though a new life had com- menced for her, filled with indomitable energy and hope. She spoke not of herself, but of the kind captain's wife, of his fireside and little ones, of his partings and meetings, and the responsibilities, so little appreciated, of the seaman's   HELEN COURTENA. -        71 checkered life. Then she touched, especially, upon his individual cares; how many lives he held, as it were, in his hands; how many hopes were centred in his skill; how many tears would follow any mismanagement on his part; what wrecks of joy would ensue if the ship that he guided so carefully were itself to become a wreck. Then she, talked of his loneliness, and next of his long desired welcome in his happy home; until, for a moment, the sailor forgot himself in the parent and husband; and as he looked mechanically up to the heavens to discover the signs of the night, he found his eyes strangely dim with fast-coming tears. He had already stayed from his post too long, and sooth- ing and pleasant as were the conversation and presence of his companion, he told her that she must return at once to her now dreaded and close prison below. But whether she prattled like an infant, or reasoned like a woman, or com- manded like a queen, or ordered like a tyrant, he knew not; he only knew that in obedience to her desires in some way expressed, and in no way to be resisted, he bound her slight form with her scarf to one of the columns, for even he with difficulty kept his footing, as the huge waves rocked his vessel like a cradle; and promising to return for her in a short space of time, left her in darkness to her solitary thoughts. There was no beauty in the scene, yet it was beyond expression grand; it was night without the accompani- ments of stars or moon-a thick gloomy mass of lowering clouds. The wind, which during the day had shrieked through the cordage with one continuous sound, as of pain and torture, never lulling, never abating, and against which it was hopeless to battle, came now only at intervals; and, as if weary with wailing and moaning, sobbed in discordant agony. The waves that had dashed in their fury upon the deck now burst athwart the sides of the vessel with a sul- len noise, as though some chained giant were beating against his prison doors. And yet in the face of all this chaos Helen felt no fear; her faith in at last reaching her destination was entire; others might be lost, she thought, but in some miraculous     72       HELEN C URTENTA Y way she would be saved. Had an idea of death come to her, she would have been reckless or terrified like the rest. True, she felt that there was danger, but not for herself, for others. Hers was a strange state of mind, and she grew calmer every moment while becoming gradually accustomed to the darkness. It did not occur to her that there was anything peculiar in her situation; all seemed natural enough; nor did she shrink with affright from some one whose step she heard approaching her, and who at length grasped the same support to which she was clinging. She even speculated about the personality of the intruder. He was a man, evidently, shethougit, for no woman save herself would have dared to venture there; not the cap- tain, for he would have spoken, and yet none of the crew; that was no place for them. She could not refrain from speaking; this unconscious, silent interloper appeared to re- quire it from her. What she said took the form of an apology. I trust that I have not usurped any one's rights by coming here to this sheltered nook?" she asked. The person so addressed was startled by hearing a voice in such close proximity, and vague thoughts of mermaids and spirits of the air flitted through his mind; but conclud- ing that neither had human voices, and being a little ashamed of having been startled by a supposed apparition, he replied: "Not at all; I kneiv that there was a recess just in this spot, and came to seek it. If you will bear with my pre- sence for a few minutes until this gust of wind is past, I will repair to the corresponding place on the other side." "That will not be necessary," she answered; "the cap- tain will return for me in a little while, and then you can have my vacated position. I grew tired of the cabin, that dreary under-world; and he kindly brought me, in compli- ance with my earnest desire, to watch the changes of this terrible night." "As to you, so there is to me, a strange fascination in the wildness of this fearful storm," was the reply. "But are you a stranger to fear, that unlike the rest of your sex you come to brave the fury of the elements; or has this deceitful calm given you courage?"   H ELEN O URTENAY.        73 "I am not afraid," she answered; "I have faith." "And that may be, too," replied the other. "4If you mean faith in God, He is the God of the dying as well as of the living; and death just now threatens us on every side. In either case are you prepared to live or to die, as He pleases; to be as calm when the portal to the unknown and untried is open, as you are at this moment?" There was something about this unseen stranger that drew Helen mentally near him, apart from the license which the scene and the circumstances warranted. She believed in the theory of spheres of sympathy, of attrac- tion and repulsion, interest and indifference towards certain people and certain minds. Even in her childhood it needed but a few minutes' intercourse with new acquaintance to determine their position respecting herself. As one in a garden walk gathers only such flowers as suit his taste, and wears them lovingly upon his breast, or holds them with close clasp in his hand, rejecting others, though their beauty or sweet perfume may be unquestioned; so Helen selected her friends, living in a world of sympathies of her own creating. She cared not to be popular with the many; she only desired to attract those who attracted her: and experiencing this mesmeric affinity in the present instance, she impulsively and without forethought as to the antece- dents of the stranger, continued a conversation that had opened with so much interest to herself. "I have not thought much of death," she returned; "that was not my meaning when I spoke. It is this: I have a feeling within me, as strong as a Christian's faith in life eternal, that not yet is my life temporal to be ended; in due time we shall be safe in port." But these words so quietly uttered, though they struck her listener as almost sublime in their recklessness, did not convince him of the safety of the ship. Whoever she was, it was but right, he thought, that she should at least have an idea of her danger; perhaps to converse further with her upon the subject would help to awaken her from her dream of security. "It would seem by your voice and by your venturesome spirit that you are young," he continued; "and it is hard 4     74       HELEN COURTENA . for youth to give up life. It is sad to see anything fresh- born and comparatively new to earth, be it a bird, a flower, or something higher in the list of creation, die. To us it is unnatural, and the hardest to understand of the dispensa- tions of the All-merciful Maker. To create and to destroy are to mortals utterly antagonistic, though one can look without any great shock of the feelings upon a gradual decay. But to raise questions upon so veiled ahd myste- rious a subject is almost to doubt, and that I did not mean to do. I merely referred to it as a prelude, for I myself can speak of this love of life with experience. Not long ago, when a sudden danger menaced me, it seemed very sweet to live, and most appalling to leave this beautiful earth, and at the instant of my extremest peril I drew two pic- tures in my mind: one, death and an uncertain future; the other a long, happy life, the affections satisfied, ambition gratified, a cheerful home, with its accompaniments of vir- tue and religion; and I uttered a prayer, wise or unwise I know not, for the future alone can tell me, a prayer heard only in heaven: 'God, if it please Thee, let me live.'" "Hush," she replied, in a tone as sad as the wailing wind, while the breath of a sigh fluttered from her lips and played upon his face, as he bent to listen to her; "do not mock me with pictures of happiness, or joyous firesides, or the sweet delights of home. Speak only of the strug- gles of existence-its weariness; compare it to a battle- field, not a garden of Paradise." "Forgive me," he answered, "if I have unwittingly touched upon a jarring chord. I meant not to mock you, not even to intrude upon you; but since fate has so strange- ly thrown us together, and feeling on my part that some bond of sympathy must exist between two who for the same purpose had sought the same scene, I remained when perhaps I should not, to know more of one who, not unlike myself, dared to look face to face upon the terrors of a storm at sea. Moreover, there was something in your first words, and in the tone of your voice, that assured me ours would be no idle, careless talk. Oh, no; God forbid that, on the brink, perhaps, of a fearful death." "Death!" she exclaimed, impressed with the solemnity   HELEN COUR O TEA Y.       75 of his manner, and suddenly awakening to a sense of dan- ger; "I must not, cannot die; at least not yet." "Is life, then, so sweet to you too " he asked. "Sweet!"The word dropped from her lips like molten metal, and had she said no more the listener would have understood her; but she continued sadly, and with an im- pulsiveness foreign to her usual manner: 'No; but I have an object in living, a task to perform; something which must not be left undone, and in which no mortal hand can help me." Strange infatuation! She yearned, she burned to tell him her secret. Shared with another, it would be so light!- And why not tell him? He seemed sent in that myste- rious hour for some definite purpose. True, she had never seen him, might never behold him, but the idea that some one would understand, pity, and think of her, would be an inexpressible relief to her overcharged heart. "There is no grief like the grief which does not speak." r But her secret was untold. Let him who would a cuse Woman of a betrayal of trust pause ere he utter the accusa- tion. Her temptations, her need for sympathy, her long- ing for converse upon a forbidden theme, are great, but her integrity is greater; and she would sooner part with life or limb than betray what is intrusted to her keeping. The grave of a secret is a true woman's heart. Her companion paused for a moment ere he replied, but before he spoke some one was heard advancing, and Helen recognised the footsteps of the captain. Proceeding to un- loose the fastening which secured her, she said, with the gaiety which the young can never wholly forget, however deep a sorrow surrounds them: "You see, or you do not see, that I am bound like some shipwrecked maiden to this pillar with my scarf. The time allotted me for my stay has expired; the captain comes, I must obey him; let me resign my place to you." "We can continue to share it together," he answered; "is there not room for both " "No," she replied mournfully, "that may not be. I told you that it was my mission on earth to give up my best pleasures for the good of others. Forget me, and farewell."     76       HELEN COURTENAY. There was something in the sad cadence of her tone that touched his very soul; and though he held out his arms in the darkness as if to arrest the shape that glided by him, he knew by the silence that she had gone-gone from his presence, but not from his memory: for ever and anon the music of her voice haunted him, and her sorrow and her loneliness, and the midnight scene, seemed to him like a vision of dreamland, and not what he sometimes doubted it to be, a real experience. During the night a fiercer storm broke over the devoted vessel, and it seemed a miracle that she stood against the war of winds, while the angel of death hovered above her ready to pronounce the doom of shipwreck; but the mor- row brought the daylight and the sunlight; and passing the distant view of rock-bound Ireland, and catching a nearer glimpse of the checkered and fertile mountain sides from St. George's Channel, she glided amid a forest of masts into the safe anchorage of the wished-for harbor of Liver- pool. Helen, from choice, and by the advice of the captain, still continued in seclusion until the cares incident upon his arrival in port allowed him to give her his attention. The passengers were landed and proceeded to their differ- ent destinations; nor did Herbert Drayton dream that she who had watched with him in that fearful storm, whose face and form he had not seen, but whose presence lin- gered about him like some far-off memory, and whom he in vain tried to discover and designate in that motley crowd, was giving up her youth, her home, friendship, love, hope, her life's best pleasures even, for him. CHAPTER VIII. HELEN COURTENAY had crossed the ocean. Afar off in her own home, she had looked upon that achievement as abso- lutely stupendous; but she now realized that, stormy as the   'TELEN COURTENAY.        " waters had been, they were calm compared with that other voyage-the voyage of life-that stretched before her. Her journey ended not with her leaving the vessel which had borne her to Liverpool; her contemplated home, for some time to come, being London. She made the captain her friend, and cheerfully placing her in the care of a pro- per escort, he gave her a direction where, with her attend- ant, she could find a pleasant and comfortable lodging. Once there, in that beating heart of the world, whose pulsations are-heard and felt from ocean to ocean, and from pole to pole-what could our heroine find to do? What had brought her there-a mite in creation of less conse- quence than the smallest grain of dust in Westminster Abbey, or the faintest shade of coloring on the great cathe- dral walls? Helen had come to be an actress! This decision she had arrived at after a long period of patient thought, and in answer to a question ever and ever repeated to herself in the dead watches of the night, and entirely utilitarian in all its bearings: "In what way can I save or make the greatest amount of money? Her answer mentally was the following: "I know that I am equal to something great; I feel it in me to conceive, to dare, to execute. Others have amassed enormous sums of money-so can I. What cau I do? Others have been successful, urged on simply by love of gain or by a desire to exhibit certain talents. I am actuated by a principle, a promise. I must return to one who has been defrauded his just rights. Come, let there be no self-depreciation, no self-exaltation. Let me see just what I am intellectually and in a working point worth. What are the resources open to women for gain? Would patient needle-work during a whole course of years help me? No; I should die at my post of inaction, and faint under the miserable labor from the small returns of my toil. Can I write and make books that would interest the world, and so be well paid for my pathos or wit? No, that path lies not open to me. I have not ideality enough to create: authorship is higher than I can soar. Can I paint, and satisfy men and women with     78       IIELEN COURTENA Y. pictured reflections of themselves, so that they would give gold for their portraits; or can I imitate nature so well in landscape, that princes would entertain me at their palaces, and buy my paintings for the sake of my genius? Alas, no. I am ready, it is true, with my pencil; but by no means gifted with so extraordinary a development of artis- tic talent. Can I teach 2 Yes, perhaps so; but who would trust an unknown adventuress with the management of a school, for my work must be far away from all old associa- tions of friendship; and even if I were to be an instructress, should I be content with the yearly pittance given to a neophyte in the art of teaching t True, I might be a governess-an office more to my mind than any other, for it has its pleasures in spite of its pains, and allows one some retirement and privacy; but then I must have letters of recommendation, and must be able to display the accom- plishments of a goddess in order to astonish some moneyed ignoramus, that I might be paid anything of an adequate salary. Is there nothing else Heaven keep me, what can I do?  Then came a picture of her past life, its duties and plea- sures; and brighter and more luminous than all stood the memory of a talent for which she had been praised by men and women who, she knew, were good judges-her power of impersonating different characters, and of imitating others-in short, her wonderful gift of acting. She re- membered with especial pleasure that her father, who had enjoyed opportunities of seeing the best histrionic genius in the world, had encouraged her with words and looks of praise. In their little world she had been called a star, and she felt equal to sustain the position awarded her; for her memory never failed, and her correct delineation of character called forth bursts of applause from an admiring audience. Robed as a queen in Macbeth, she felt a queen, and gathered her gorgeous drapery around her like one born to royalty; or, in the character of the poor, crushed Desdemona, she knew that she could play upon the hearts of those around her as upon an instrument of music, and hold them awe-struck with wonder or melted in pitying tears.   HELEN COURTENA Y.        79 "I will be an actress," she said to herself decidedly; "I will go to London and study the art faithfully as a profes- sion. I will lay aside timidity and personal misgivings, repressing all womanly fear and diffidence. I will be doubly an actress, performing a p $1i the stage and in my every-day life, because with t e influence of nights so artificial as those passed upon the boards of a theatre, I should never feel quite like myself in the morning hours of a retired home. Everything must yield to my one life- object; and I will so exert myself, bringing every resource within me to bear upon my work, that laurels will be showered upon my head. Foi any merit which I espe- cially may display?-ah! no, not for myself will I seek a crown of fame, but only as an end, to preserve in its purity the fair name of my father." And in London we have caught a glimpse of her, with its Thames and its ships; its hurrying crowds, and its po- verty and wealth; its paintings and statuary; its Babel of sounds, its vice and its virtue; its buildings great and mean; the darkness hanging over its damp, smoky streets; the enlightenment of its aristocracy, the ignorance of the common mind-but of all these she thought not. As she had said, life had for her but one idea, and this was follow- ed out conscientiously with her faithful Mary by her side, as she went the morning after her arrival to lay a train for her future path of toil. The same kind friend under whose charge she had been placed by the captain before leaving her, gave her the names of the managers of the leading theatres, and where they were to be found; and though she had conned over the name of the first upon the list until it sounded to her almost as familiar as her own, still when a servant appeared at the door in answer to her summons, she trembled as she asked in timid tone for him she had come to seek, and who certainly held no frightful cognomen, that of Mr. Gage. It was not the thought of her novel position alone which alarmed her, it was the strange sights and sounds; the new world of customs that bewildered and took away from her that quiet self-possession which was almost our heroine's birthright.     80       HELEN COURTENVA Y With a pompous air, the lackey introduced her into an apartment where Mr. Gage held his court, and requested her to be seated until some business then on hand was dis- missed. The business alluded to was not of a nature to inspire Helen with confidence; for standing before him, and reading with a trembling voice, stood a pale, sickly-looking, but pretty young girl, who had evidently come upon the same errand as herself-namely, as a candidate for the stage. "Too low, too high," said the manager, as her voice fell or rose in reading; "too little expression, too much; ah, young lady, you must try your powers upon something of less importance than the stage-that educator of mankind. And yet," he continued, musing, " so pretty and delicate a face might take, and bring down some applause. My advice to you is, that you study the best dramatists for a year or two longer-throw more soul into your recitations-look less wretchedly sad-and you may succeed, in time." Helen saw the poor girl flush, then grow pale, and as the rejected candidate tied on her simple bonnet and tried to hide her face, she noticed that tears were streaming down her white cheeks. "O God of mercy!" she said to her- self as she looked pityingly upon the disappointed aspirant, "perhaps her daily bread depends upon the success of this day's application; perhaps she has starving brothers and sisters at home!"She was so lost in thought as to her com- panion's antecedents, that a question twice addressed to her by Mr. Gage seemed like a voice heard in a dream. "Your name, young lady?" Helen was awakened most effectually from her reverie; for in all the thoughts that she had expended upon her probable adventures, successes, or failures, the idea had not occurred that she would be called upon so suddenly and unceremoniously for her name. To give her own was out of the question; as an actress, with that appendage of her old life attached to her, and the possessor of great wealth, her friends would come and, accusing her of insanity, drag her from the stage, thus defeating her only hope of success. All this added to her confusion; and when, after several attempts to pronounce some syllables which might serve as   IIELET COT URTENA Y.       81 an answer to his question, the words Ida Clayborne, the ro- inantic appellation of a favorite doll of her childhood, came from her trembling lips, she felt almost supernaturally sup- ported in being supplied in her need with so far off a mem- ory. The effort, however, to regain her self-possession was almost beyond her strength. "Be seated,' Miss Ida Clayborne," said Mr. Gage, with a condescending wave iof the hand, " and be kind enough to command yourself sufficiently to give correct answers to my questions." Helen did as he desired, but felt as if the day of the inquisition had returned, andc that tortures, many and cruel, were in store for her. "It is your desire, I suppose by your presence here, to become an actress?" said Mr. Gage. The trembling applicant simply bowed. "Be kind enough, then," said the Grand Inquisitor, " to inform me in what peculiar line your talents have deve- loped themselves? There is a wide range from a prima-donna of the opera to a ballet dancer; in what branch do you excel?" "You can best judge," faltered poor Helen; "though you can spare yourself the trouble of thinking any more of two of the departments of art mentioned on the list; I cannot dance, and my voice in singing is not fitted for the stage." "What! not. know where to locate yourself?" he re- turned  "On the broad ground of the drama not know where you belong? Not know if you can do Tragedy, High Comedy, Low Comedy, or Farce; Melodrama, Tra- vcstie, Vaudeville, or Miracle Plays?" At this point in the interview the stage-manager saw something in Helen's eye and manner that put an end to his sarcasm, and warned him from the position which- he had taken, as a gesture warns an intruder from forbidden ground. Somewhat cowed, he said, with an attempt at an apology: "We critics are so bored, Miss Clayborne must excuse a little impatience in tone and. manner; and she will be kind enough to give us a display of her powers of elo- cution by reading something in her line." 4*     82        HELENX CO UR TENA Y. Thereupon a book was placed in the candidate's hand, containing some fine selections from Beaumont and Fletcher, with which unfortunately she was unacquainted. Oh, for her own Shakspeare, she thought, or for any of the favorite plays of the day; but an emphatic "Read," left her no choice. The reading was almost a failure, of course; those stern eyes bent upon her, that dictatorial air of superiority proved almost too much for the new aspirant; and yet, with all her trembling and hoarseness, her wrong accentuation, her mistakes, the man using his power so cruelly, the judge, saw a gleam of genius in her far above any which had ever shone in his benighted mind, and which it was seldom his privilege to behold; and his eyes brightened when he thought what a magnet, under proper training, she might become to the play-loving world. Helen stopped for breath; she knew that she was read- ing too rapidly; there was no room for the lofty pauses of passion in her rendering; the words appeared to blend one with another, and she seemed to herself to be making a v senseless jargon of the whole. "Proceed," said Mr. Gage, more kindly than before, and with a condescending deference in his manner; but Helen's stock of fortitude was exhausted, and she burst into a pas- sion of tears. Then she felt a hand of encouragement laid on her shoulder; but it was too late. Come to-morrow," said Mr. Gage; "under favorable auspices, with your fine voice, your well shaped head, your wonderfully bright eyes, and your graceful figure, you may become a good, perchance a great actress. It would give me pleasure to see more of you; yes, come again to-morrow." But Helen turned away indignant; she had a contempt for the man who knew how to speak so kindly, and had neglected to encourage her at first; and echoing his words, though in a negative sense, she found herself saying like a spoiled child as she left the house: "( Mary, I hate him; I love to hate him; no, I shall not come to-morrow." Our heroine was no angel; her faults were legion, and self-will her predominant characteristic.   HELEN 'COURITENA Y.       83 The second person upon her list was Mr. Bland. Whether Helen argued gentler things from his name, or had become courageous from: her late experience she could not deter- mine; but it wa with a prouder step that she entered his domicile, and stated her wishes and what she thought were her claims to his notice. She merely desired to know from him whether by great attention she could attain eminence in the profession to which she had somewhat turned her thoughts; and in such a case, if he were willing to secure her services upon the stage of which he was director. She was herself once more; there was power in her speech and bearing; the look of trouble and dependence which she had worn a while ago had left her; those few r scalding tears that she had shed had eased her heart of a weight of woe, and had flushed her cheek with an unusual glow. Mr. Bland looked at her curiously; she was a study, evi- dently something not to be seen in the every-day walks of life. Helen did not wait to be invited to a seat; one was -at hand and she took it, feeling perfectly self-sustained while undergoing Mr. Bland's not impolite scrutiny. "Every life has its history," he said at last; "if the young lady is not averse to it, will she be kind enough to tell me something of her past experiences and her future aims?" "I am an American," replied Helen obediently, because the questioner was most respectful in his tone and manner; "and I am an orphan. I have assumed the name of Ida Clayborne, because just now I would rather not bear my own, and it is incumbent on me to support myself. I speak in confidence; -it suits me to concealthe former circum- stances of my life; and should you engage me, it will be to your interest to aid me to remain incognito. Believing that I have talents peculiarly adapted to the stage, I desire to become an actress. I was directed hither by a gentleman who knows something of the machinery of theatrical life, and your commendation or encouragement will help to decide my future course." "Your voice is good," replied Mr. Bland, in return; "clear, sonorous, artistic; and a correct enunciation is Ithe     84       HELEN COURTENAY. first requisite for the stage, and its chief ornament. The beauty of an angel, unaccompanied by this quality, avails no- thing; in fact, I have seen a young debfitante, the loveliest creature I ever beheld, all grace and radiance, actually hissed from the boards for the want of voice; while, on the con- trary, a huge, red-faced, material-looking artiste, with a large- soul, and a tongue and lungs to give it proper expression, was crowned, applauded, and rewarded with gardens of bouquets, jewels, tears, and smiles; nor did she receive more than she deserved. It is the voice that sways the pas- sions of the fickle public heart. Do you read as well as you speak?" Helen almost smiled at this business-like way of proceed- ing, and on the whole felt very much at home with Mr. Bland; whose manner, though somewhat brusque, was cal- culated to give her encouragement. She took the volume which he extended to her and longed to clasp it'to her heart, for it was one with which she had been familiar for years: The Acting Plays of Shak- speare, the exact copy of a book that belonged to her, and from her earliest childhood had been her constant com- panion. It had lain under her pillow at night; it had accom- panied her in her boating, riding, and driving excursions; she had taken it with her into the mellow autumn woods, and when the tender spring opened still her hands turned its enchanted pages; she had never felt entirely alone in the loneliest nooks while bending over its leaves, and by patient rtindy had memorized entire plays. Her eyes beamed with a strange lighit as she beheld her favorite in the director's hands; Mr. Bland himself became a cipher, certainly not of as much consequence as a wood- squirrel leaping from branch to bough; the sunshine no longer streamed through glass panes into the room, but flickered in among greenest foliage; the soft air of the pri- meval forest blew upon her face; a chorus of bird-voices mingled with her own; bending trees were her audience; she was far away in her pebble-lined grotto, and she read, her soul in the words and music in her soul. Unconsciously she arose and closed the book, which 'at length slipped nnperceived from her hands while standing 'a one in-   HELEN COURTENAY.         85 spired; page after page was declaimed, her voice softening in tenderness, or exultant, or scornful, or trumpet-toned, as the different characters or passages required. At last there came a pause, for the play that she had chosen was ended; and Helen awoke to the consciousness of her surroundings and who her listener was, by a voice wrung from no paid claqueur, but genuine as deserved merit could make it, crying: "Bravo, bravo!" and she knew that she had done well, for it was a word of admiration given by an experienced judge, and its significance thrilled her with a sudden joy. She felt dizzy, faint, weary, and yet there was a sense of power and triumph over all. She had not crossed' the ocean in vain. The manager's voice addressing her recalled her to her- self. He spoke in a serious tone, like one who has an im- portant theme to discuss, and closed the door as though she might pass outward like a spirit into her native air. "I cannot speak in terms high enough of your powers of elocution," he said; "the word star is indelibly written upon your brow. It requires only a few months' study and ac- quaintance with stage forms to make you what, in your highest aspirations, you have desired to become. You will consider yourself engaged to appear under my auspices, and upon terms most liberal to yourself. It only remains now for me to learn your address, and to introduce you to a professor who will aid you in your future career." Helen's reading proved to be only a prelude to long in- terviews held between Mr. Bland and herself. She told him that she was quite willing and anxious to be regularly in- structed for the stage, not caring to commence her work without a certainty of success; that she should like to take lodgings with some respectable family who were connected with the theatre; and was willing, when pronounced com- petent and ready, and as soon as she felt confidence in her- self, to make her first appearance--and s6 the matter was settled. So well satisfied was the manager with the worth of his new prize, that he was careful not to lose sight of her; and after diligent inquiry, found just the home for her that she desired. Then Helen and her good Mary, with their small stock of possessions, were removed from their     86       HELEN COUR TENA Y. temporary lodgings to another abode, while Mr. Bland whispered in select circles certain prophetic words concern- ing a new luminary inll the theatrical world-words not lost upon those interested in the pleasure and satisfaction attend- ing the advent of a young, new, and brilliant actress. ---- CHAPTER IX. DECIDEDLY humble and poverty-stricken was the little family with whose fortunes our heroine now connected her- self, and whose members regarded her almost as an angel visitant; for the addition to their income brought by her was like a gleam of light in the darkness of their toil and penury. A theatrical life was an hereditary one in their household; the old, bed-ridden father, who lay helpless and infirm, having many a tale to tell of the successive rise of stars in his day, when he was promoted from a call-boy to a prompter, or played the part of one of a grand army, or of a chorus; while the mother still blushed with pride at the memory of an encore that she had received in the long ago of her youth, when her mother, then the " duenna," had gravely told her that she was as fine an actress as had ever appeared on any stage. The family, besides these, consisted of a daughter-a young girl rosy with health, in love with life, and with a dis- position as cheerful and a heart as kind as any beneath the heavens. Not many days had elapsed before a strong friendship sprang up between Annie Lovell and the new-comer to her parents' humble abode; and Helen soon found how dreary the hours would have been without her companionship. Sometimes in our pilgrimage through life we meet with those whose souls, hearts, and minds suit our own; whose conversation is a perpetual feast; whose ideas and thoughts so cllime in with ours, that we wonderingly ask ourselves how, in the long years of the past. we have lived without   HELEN COURTENA Y.         87 "ur new friends. It was thus with Helen at this period of her career, when she thought of Annie; her very presence was joy-inspiring; her coming filled the low portal with a radiant light, and her departing darkened the homestead with a solemn gloom; no glad laughter, no cheerful con- verse, no voice of song remained when she had left. Such sweet good-nature, such endless smiles, notwithstanding the burdenii laid upon her, made continual sunshine around, and Helen was grateful in her heart of hearts for intercourse so happy and inspiriting. Annie seemed never out of place; under any circumstances. Everything became her equally well;--reading with Helen at her father's bedside; relating to him the events of the outer world, from which he was excluded; assisting her mother in some menial household duty; or robed at night (for Annie was an actress too) for a village lassie, a grand lady's soubrette, or a May-day queen. Luckily, in the midst of temptations such as would assail a girl of Annie Lovell's attractions, and in the publicity of a theatrical life, she had a safeguard which kept her pure in thought, word, and deed; and Helen soon discovered why she preferred the pleasures of home to every other charm. The sunny side of the humble domicile-for even in smoky London a few gleams of golden light blessed their home- was decorated with pet plants and birds that required her care in every moment of unoccupied time; and one morning when thus attending them, Annie confessed to Helen that they were the gifts of her betrothed, the handsome young mechanic -whom Helen had so often seen in her company. Love then was the- talisman guarding the life and heart of the young actress. Helen had likewise noticed that Annie's admirer was most deferential in his bearing to the father and mother; not forgetting, even though his eyes followed his betrothed in all her movements, after the fashion of lovers, that it was his duty to have a care for their welfare and comfort. It was further revealed to her that he was only awaiting a rise in his business to unite his and Annie's earnings, enabling him to give her a home she could call her own; thus relin- quishing the arduous profession of an actress for those     88       HELEN COUR TENA Y. retired and sweeter scenes of domestic life he loved to pic- ture in glowing colors as their future happy portion. It was a pleasant task to Helen to watch their daily in- creasing attachment, their trust in each other, and the charming contrast of his manly beauty and her feminine graces. Every evening brought him punctually to their door to accompany her to the theatre, and conduct her home after her performances for the night. Sometimes under their loving escort, and they felt proud of their charge, Helen accompanied them, and remained in the green-room during the acting, in order to accustom herself as much as possible to the motley crowd and varied scenes behind the curtain, so peculiarly belonging to that department; and Annie and Hermann soon entertained a feeling of admiration in addition to that of affection for one whom the manager always received with such pointed at- tentions, and who, Annie well knew, would far eclipse her in celebrity. Moreover, the young stranger completed the conquest of Annie's heart by adding a few rare exotics to her conservatory, and bringing new songsters to the porch, where they spent many an hour together, twining the clus- tering vines in graceful festoons, and gathering sweet bou- quets to gladden the eyes of the invalid father. Besides these, Helen surprised and delighted her friend by the in- troduction of a sweet-toned piano into the little parlor; for music was a necessity in the life of the former, and Annie listened with most appreciating ear to the melody of her touch and voice. It had been Helen's plan to live with the most scrupu- lous economy; but her board was so far short of the sum which she, in her ignorance, had calculated upon, that the little luxuries in which she indulged did not at all trench upon her purse, and the amount set aside to cover her daily expenses. Besides this, with commendable forethought, she had brought from her American home a sufficient out- lay to cover her instruction by a professor of elocution, and to defray the expenses required for the wardrobe of a-pro- minent actress; added to this, she received an occasional remittance from Stephen Gerald, who was ever watchful of her, even though lie considered her self-exile as a tempo   HELEN COURTENA Y         89 rary matter and a part of her eccentric character, expecting her to return in every new arrival to take possession of her inheritance, which now, under proper management, was daily and hourly increasing in value. In devoted study, and in the indulgence of those little home pleasures which have been mentioned, Helen passed her time. Each day she felt more conscious of strength to sustain the part that she had chosen, and not only did her internal convictions assure her that she was equal to the work, but Annie, whose taste was not to be questioned, having seen the brightest stars of the stage, and being her- self perfect in her own casts of character, was most enthusi- astic in her friend's favor; while Mr. Bland, who never lost sight of the prize he had found, continued to bestow upon her his unqualified approbation. But what she valued more than each and all were the encouraging words of the profes- sor, who assured her that hers was a peculiar gift, and that in- struction from him was almost superfluous; because she was fortunate enough to possess that rare qualification, original- ity. le advised her, however, to persevere in her studies with as much assiduity as was exhibited by an ambitious danseuse who, he assured her, in perfecting herself in her branch of art, would stand for hours and days in one par- ticular posture in order to give strength and pliancy to her limbs. Many months had passed, and the manager to whom Helen was pledged was most anxious for her appearance; but still the fateful hour was delayed. It was one thing to hear his approving "Bravo," and to meet Annie's smile of admiration at the recitation of striking passages; and ano- ther thing to face a crowded audience, standing unmoved before their myriad eyes, hearing perhaps disparaging criti- cisms, and worst of all, braving the presence of some Ameri- can who might whisper around that she was an heiress who had forsaken the retirement of a comfortable home for a public life of adventure. No; she was not yet quite equal to all these possibilities; she required still more time; and in the meanwhile the mysterious whispers continued, and Mr. Bland's new pro- t6gee was talked of as much as he could desire, and was     90       HELEN CO URTENA Y. likely, since he was most just and conscientious, to reap a full harvest for her performances. During this interval there occurred in Helen's lowly home an event which helped to form her own character, re- vealing her in the light of a Mentor, a position in which she most unexpectedly found herself. The incidents of this time, with their opposite traits, bright and dark, their strength and weakness, virtue and vice, she ever regarded as one of the marked passages in her book of existence, leaving a never-dying memory of a strange combination of circumstances, in which she herself held no unimportant part. Annie Lovell numbered among her friends a neighbor, who was her promised bridesmaid, a maiden bearing the pretty cognomen of Belle Burton; and so great was the contrast between the two, that Helen often playfully desig- nated them by the names of Blanche and Brunette. Annie loved the dark-eyed beauty for her attention and devoted- ness to herself, knowing nothing more of her personally, as she was comparatively a new-comer in their vicinity; but others whispered that Belle was not perfection, love of ad- miration being her besetting sin; Belle sacrificing to it everything in her nature that was good and praiseworthy. In the humble capacity of seamstress, as she took home her weekly package of work to the houses of the great, she had often been told that she was charming, and far too pretty to be wasting her life in the inglorious occupation of needle- woman, and the poor child soon learned to expect compli- ments-decking herself to the best advantage that she might receive them. If this had been all; if the careful mother, who watched with jealous eyes over the conduct of her child, had been able to arrest Belle's love of conquest at this point, it would have been well for her and others; but her vanity, had it not been for a most unforeseen inter- vention, came nigh working not only her own ruin, but the wretchedness of one whom she professed to love. Annie Lovell's marriage-day had at length been decided upon; her little trousseau, so grand in Belle's eyes, was all completed; her muslin dress, exquisitely simple, lay ready for the wearer; the white kid gloves, the satin slippers, the   HELEN COURTENA Y.        91 wreath of orange blossoms, were admired again and again by the bridesmaid expectant; and if there were two happy hearts in the whole wide range of creation, they were most certainly beating in the bosoms of that youth and maiden who were so soon to join their hands in the indissoluble bonds of-love and eternal constancy. The last night of her public performances had arrived, and Annie appeared all ready equipped for her character in the parlor of the homestead, with something added to her usual moonlight loveliness-a timid maidenly air that was most bewitching, a conscious purity, mingled with an almost proud look of triumph, not entirely for herself, but for him who stood beside-her, half worshipping her as a vision of light and beauty. -Report had told the usual play-goers of the theatre in which she- performed of her coming m( riage, and appreciating her gentleness, lady-like propriety, and the perfect memorizing of the parts assigned her, they had expressed their desire that Mr. Bland should give the bride- elect a benefit, so that the result would be something tangi- ble wherewith to begin her new vocation of housekeeping. A simple silver service, too, the gift of the other actors, was to be bestowed upon Annie when she was called out after the performance, and this was to be kept secret from Her- mann and herself until the moment of presentation. The news of this pretty by-play, interlinked with the drama that had been chosen for her, gathered a full house, and the flush on her cheek deepened for a moment when her betrothed brought the intelligence of an unusual sale of tickets to greet her last appearance. The play was simple enough, an afterpiece following the grand performance of a distinguished artist, who kindly lent' his talents to grace the festal night; but this did not take away Annie's impor- tance in the eyes of those loving ones who blessed her as she left the home circle for the theatre. Her father laid his trembling hands upon her head, and called her the best and most dutiful daughter that had ever brightened an old man's departing years; her aged mother, with fond pride, likened her to the brilliant actresses of all ages and nations that had ever been applauded by the public voice; while Helen wrapped her cloak more securely around her, and     92       HELEN COURTENA Y. imprinted upon her pure brow a kiss, as a parting benedic- tion of love. At midnight she returned, and according to her direc- tions so softly, fearful that she would awake her sleeping parents, that they knew not for some time, and until all was completed that could have been done for her welfare, that a terrible calamity had befallen their child. A feverish anxiety had possessed Helen (perhaps linking Annie's triumph or failure somewhat with her own expe- riences) to know the result of her friend's benefit, and she did not retire, but sat studying and awaiting her arrival. A little after the expected time, a carriage stopped at the door, and Helen, smiling at so unusual a piece of extrava- gance on the part of the economical lovers, who were always saving for the promised wedded-life home, concluded that a most brilliant house had warranted the expenditure; but her smiles quickly disappeared, to be followed by anxious solicitude, when she heard a confused murmur of voices, not ringing in the joyous tones of an epithalamium, but suppressed and solemn; and then what alarmed her more was the consciousness that the attempt to hush the tones to whispers was succeeded by an ominous silence. Quiclly descending the little stairway to discover the meaning of the sound of so many footsteps in that unseasonable hour, a frightful procession met her view, chilling her blood, and making her dizzy with horror; but a deprecatory look and gesture from a gentleman who appeared to be followed and obeyed by the others, prevented her from weeping and wailing, and forced her to preserve her self-possession, while she gazed sorrowfully upon the mournful train. Annie Lovell, in the white, gauzy dress that she had worn on parting with her, lay quite still and motionless in her lover's arms, while near them walked a grave-looking individual, whose look, in imposing silence upon Helen, had said so much and had so effectually restrained her outhurst of grief. Behind them came the stage manager, and yet a little in the rear a danseuse with her tissue and stockinet only half covered with a faded shawl, though a world of tenderness and sympathy shone in her painted face. Annie's sweet countenance, from the brow so lovingly kissed by   HELEN aCOURTENAY.        93 Helen, to the softly rounded chin, was bound on one side with a bandage, upon which appeared spots of blood, while over her white dress were marks of clotted gore; in addi- tion to the wound on her face, Helen perceived that she had sustained an injury upon her foot or ankle. No word was uttered, and the sad retinue moved onward to Annie's apartment, while Helen thought that she saw Hermann draw his light burden more closely to his breast as he beheld its simple decorations, its flower vases and engravings, his gifts to his affianced bride. When the suffering girl had been placed carefully upon the bed, and when the stranger, who proved to be a physi- cian, and who seemed acquainted with the localities of the Lovells' house, and by his intense interest in Annie to be more to them than a chance medical man, had examined the bandage which covered her cheek, and had artistically bound up her sprained ankle, he departed, recommending qdet for his patient. It was then that Helen concluded, and rightly, that he, the kind practitioner, was the physician- friend so frequently alluded to by the Lovells. Annie especially had often spoken to Helen of him in glowing ternms, in fact in so exaggerated a manner that Helen accused her of raving, and giving to a mortal attributes belonging to a higher order of beings. But when Helen remembered what she had heard of his history, how he had once been poor and obscure like the Lovells themselves, winning a place among the great, a name and fame, with the privilege of choosing his patients even among the titled of the land, and yet still insisting upon attending his old friends the Lovells whenever sickness threw its gloomy pall upon the household, refusing all remuneration for his services, she too shared their admiration, now that she had seen his veritable self, and watched his departing form with an interest she did not usually feel for strangers, as he disap- peared from the apartment. As soon as he had left, and when the most repulsive marks of her accident, the bloody garments, had been laid away out of sight, Annie asked Helen' to acquaint her parents as gently as she could with her state. This was something for which Helen was not quite prepared; she had trials enough of her own to bear, and     "      HELEN COURTENA Y. stood irresolute. When the exclamation from Annie, in a most piteous tone, "Oh, if mother were only here!" reached her, she hastened with as much fortitude as she could to tell the distressing tale that had been related to herself. Annie's acting had been most successful; flowers and garlands had been liberally showered upon her; plaudits came prolonged and hearty from her admirers; she had more than done her part. The play was nearly at an end and the fair girl was crossing a bridge, a narrow plank in a mountain gorge, when the accident occurred. About mid- way in her passage across it, with an irrresistible impulse she stopped for a moment, and, turning her sweet face to- wards the audience, with a look of gratitude and eyes brimful of tears, waved her hand and bowed a farewell to those who had so kindly patronized her on this the last night of her appearance. The unexpected recognition of their presence, in the midst of the finale of the play, caused a perfect furor of enthusiasm. Annie was very lovely as she stood in her white robe, poised in mid-air, with an angelic smile upon her lips, half joyful, half sorrowful. The pretty alli- teration, Pet of the Playhouse, became her well; she was the smallest thing in creation to recognise as a woman that had left off being a child; her figure was exquisitely pro- portioned, her hands and feet being the very perfection of symmetry; her brown hair waved in short, loose curls upon her neck; her eyes were of the brightest blue, while her red lips had that tremulous motion we sometimes see upon the lips of little children. Thus she stood, the impersona- tion of loveliness, but in another instant the whole scene changed; her pretty form, with its light muslin drapery and her flower-crowned head, lay upon the stage below bathed in fast-flowing blood. Turning to pursue her way over the narrow bridge that had no protection on either side, and which would have been safe enough had she not faced the audience, she lost her footing; and, in falling, had struck her face against a sharp projection of wood, likewise sprain- ing her ankle so severely as not to be able to place her foot upon the ground. And thus it was that an almost intolerable weight of sorrow lay upon the Lovells' hitherto happy abode. The intelli-   HELEN COURTENA-Y.        95 gence of the accident and its results nearly ended the life of the poor bed-ridden father, and brought to the mother a feeling of despair, which was entirely at variance with her usual resigned submission to misfortunes and trials; while to Hermann, who was the first to lift Annie as she fell, aild whose heart harbored curses against the careless hand that -had raised a structure so insecure, came a stupor so deep that not even the sweet voice of his betrothed, uttering words of consolation, could exorcise the gloomy spell that seemed to crush him to the earth. It was then that Helen found herself the chief actor in the troubled household. Her words spoke of hope to the father; she comforted the mother; she shamed Hermann from his weakness and helplessness; while to the poor sufferer she was father, mother, lover- all. Then, too, it was that Mary's virtues as nurse and watcher shone out conspicuously; and many a delicacy found its way to the sick-room, supplied from Helen's purse, and concocted into a tempting viand by the hands of her kind attendant. After a careful examination, Dr. Percival decided that the injury done to Annie's foot was only temporary, and that in a few weeks she would be able to walk once more; but alas! that the deep gash upon her face must for ever remain as a mark of the accident, marring its symmetry, and giving to it an expression quite foreign to its calm loveliness. In fine, it became the physician's painful task to announce to her friends that her beauty had for ever departed, and that no skill of his could avail to restore it. This he did in the kindest, gentlest manner, feeling that to say it, so truly was he interested in his patient, was as. great a trial almost as to hear it. Though the shock was great to her parents, who loved to look upon their beautiful child, yet it did not affect them so painfully as it did the despairing lover. They remembered that it was not her lovely face only that had brightened their lives, but the willing hands and the cheerful heart, and these remained to theri still; but Her- mann, who had been at first fascinated by her external self, even while he felt the worth of her virtues, worshipped the beauty which made him her willing slave. But now, mer- ciful heaven! he dared not look upon her; his pride in her     96       HELEN CO R TENAY. had vanished; nor did he, in his headstrong selfishness, think what she mentally must suffer, lying there so uncom- plaining and outwardly serene, not only from his heartless conduct but from her own reflections upon the loss of those attractions which had made her so fair in his eyes. If that terrible gash had been a felon's brand the mortification of it could scarcely have affected Hermann more deeply, or more effectually have wounded his undisciplined heart. His parents and sisters had never seen the beautiful be- trothed, and his letters to them had ever described her charms in minute details, from the brown-golden crown to the tiny foot; but now her beauty was something that belonged to the past, and men and women beholding her would taunt him with, "It might have been;" or, She would be lovely if it were not for that." Weeks wore on, and still Annie remained a prisoner in her room; while Hermann's gloom, though he. came daily to see her, grew deeper, nor did he appear anxious to con- ceal the scowl that was now seldom lifted from his brow. Perhaps if his handsome face was ever clothed with its old accustomed smile it was when Annie's bright-eyed neighbor, Belle Burton, fresh as a dew-washed flower and as rosy as day-dawn, looked in upon the melancholy group and laughed away their sadness. Helen did not remark then, but subsequently, that her visits were usually timed when Hermann was paying his customary evening call; her witty repartee making a marked contrast to Annie's lan- guid and abstracted manner, for a burden heavier than an outward deformity lay upon the young girl's innocent life. Then at the parting hour, it was but natural that Her- mann should offer to escort Belle to her home, even though it took but a few steps to reach it; and as Annie beheld them departing together, both so gifted by nature with external ornament, she sighed softly, and folding her hands, lay silent as if her heart were in prayer. These signs did not escape Helen's notice; she pondered over them, and felt a premonition that a sad era in her friend's life was near at hand, while a weight hung over her own spirit against which it was useless to struggle; and she, too, could only fold her hands like Annie, and wait.   HELEN CO URTENA Y.       97 The estrangement between the lovers, if so it could be called, each day grew more marked. But few words were exchanged between them, Hermann usually sitting moodily with his head bent down upon his hands, while Annie's at- tempts at conversation generally merged into utter silence. Then came an unmistakable appearance upon Hermann's part of weariness in the invalid's room, next impatience and irritability; and in truth it was a very sad place to all who entered therein. Belle Burton alone brightened it; but a deeper gloom than ever overshadowed it when, one day, she laughingly told Annie that Hermann had become one of her most constant visitors; and that he had as- sured her he came to her for consolation under his trials. One afternoon not long after this, Annie, with the aid of a crutch, walked towards the little mirror that so often had reflected her loveliness, and taking the bandage from her wounded face, looked long and searchingly at herself. The physician had told her that on that day it might be removed, and thus the deep scar, though -healed, was ex- posed in all its deformity. Frightened, but resolved, Annie determined never to hide it again, and since it must be, to try to accustom herself and her friends to the sight of it. The wretched girl wept passionately for a few minutes- half in self-pity, half for what Hermann had lost-with an abandonment of grief that in its paroxysms seemed strong enough to rend and destroy her slight frame; while from her lips escaped fierce and bitter regrets that she had not died in childhood, or on that fatal night; then giving one more look at the new strange face which she was thenceforth to call her own, she breathed a sigh so deep that one hearing it would have thought that the principle of life must have gonei out of her at the moment. After a pause-a solemn stillness, a mournful self-communing-she pressed her hands hard upon her breast, as though to keep down all emotion in her rebellious heart; then looking upwards, like one asking for guidance and a- blessing upon some inward resolve, calmly returned to her seat and her occupation. When Helen reentered the room after a brief absence, she 5     98       HELEN COURTENAY. saw that a change had come over her friend deeper than that outward change; an alteration for the worse as mark- ed as the signs we see on the faces of sick persons for whom we fear the next variation-death! Her eyes followed Helen with a troubled wistful gaze, and an expression of deepest love, as if she were bound to her with tenderer chords than ever; and from that earnest, sad look that said so plainly, "Care for me; for I need your care," Helen was glad to escape to her own apartment to hide her gather- ing tears. As she leaned against the window overlooking the court that separated the Burtons' house from theirs, with moist eyes watching the twilight sky, and thinking sadly that that very evening had been set apart for Annie's bridal. she heard a murmur of voices, a most unusual sound at the hour of dusk, ascending from the court below. It was seldom, if ever, used! as an entrance-way; and, curious to know who the intruders were, she cautiously looked down. The lingering daylight revealed to her two forms-that of a man and woman seated upon the low rustic bench made and placed there by Hermann for ornament rather than use, as the narrowness and darkness of the passage rendered it always gloomy and damp. The man was seated more in the shadow than the other; but in her, around whom his arm was closely entwined, whose face rested lov- ingly upon his breast, while with bent head he returned her upward gaze, Helen recognised Annie Lovell's friend, beautiful Belle Burton. The recognition did not astonish her as much as she expected-but the man, who was he?  With a terrible sinking of the heart she felt that it must be Hermann; and she stood transfixed with horror at his seeming perfidy. Her brain was in a strange whirl of perplexity, fearing that she was accusing him unjustly; weak she thought he might be, but not so wicked as that. Then with in- creased bitterness, convinced of his guilt, she charged him with breaking his vow; and, in imagination, beheld him as the murderer of her sweet friend. At length, becoming less excited, and reasoning with herself, she determined to go to Annie's room to see if she sat there, still calm and   HELEN CO URTENAY.        99 subdued, with that dumb-beast expression of patience and resignation in her eyes,-even while her lover was clasping another to his breast. 'I Could he be so false," she asked herself; "and one who loved him as Ahnie did, not know it by internal conviction'? Of course, affection so absorb- ing would discover by intuition that it was not returned." And Helen, full of pity, expected to find her friend in need of sympathy, melting in tears of agony, and wringing her hands in despair. Quickly traversing the little entry, our heroine entered the invalid's apartment without the ceremony of knocking; and there, seated near Annie, she beheld with a heart-throb of joy the much-wronged lover, Hermann White. --o-- CHAPTER X. HELEN haid become like one of the household; her ready help in time of need, her self-reliance, her evident superiority of birth and education, had led the Lovells to look up to her as a being far above themselves, with a right to act for herself and to direct others. When, there- fore, she opened Annie's door and stood upon the thresh- old, the latter deemed it no intrusion, but in her usual sweet-toned voice begged her to enter. Under the same circumstances, at any other time, Helen would have closed the door and retired; but now she felt confused and repent- ant, in fact almost wished to make some restitution to Hermann for her harsh judgment of him, or to show by her manner, at least, that he was worthy of her entire respect. Nor did thl fact that they were seated with clasped hands, though very sorrowful, deter her from her purpose. "Come in, dear Miss Clayborne," said Annie; "Her- mann and I are only having a little talk about our future, and you seem so like one of us that it would not be out of place to have you as witness of all that we say. You have     100       HELEN COUR TENA Y. been a comfort to me so long-you must be a comfort to me still." With a strange foreboding of ill, and an equally inex- plicable feeling that it was in her power to avert the com- ing evil, whatever it might be, from falling too heavily upon Annie, Helen took a seat at a window quite apart from the lovers, so shaded by the curtains that if it had depended upon her being seen to be remembered, she must soon have been forgotten; while, attracted by some incomprehensible fascination, she listened to what passed as though it vitally concerned herself. "I was saying to you, Hermann," said Annie softly, "what a glorious thing beauty in reality is; and oh, how noble, how splendid you are, dearest, with your soft wavy curls, your grand dark eyes, your perfect- mouth; and then, too, you have a strong, clear judgment, which we women, so frail, so weak ourselves, prize so much. You said once that you loved to look on beauty and hated de- formity; no wonder, with the thought of what you are, you should hate that which is repulsive." Her lover sat at her feet; one hand, meanwhile, was twined amid the locks which she had so justly praised, the other clasped his; while her eyes, that nothing could de- prive of their sky-borrowed azure, looked with their heaven of blue, deep, deep into his own. "Are you listening to me, Hermann dear?" she asked gently, while he rather turned away and shrank from her truthful gaze; "tell me if you hear every word that I say, and take in its entire meaning?" "I am listening to you, certainly," he answered; " though your theme is so flattering to myself that I think I should shut my ears, for the proverb says: 'Listen not to the voice of the charmer, charm she never so wisely. " "And do you remember how pretty I once was, dar- ling," she continued, " before this terrible gash came, which made you shudder so when you first saw it this eveningS Do you remember how the old apple-woman used to say on Sunday: ' There go my handsome couple; it is right for beauty to mate with beauty.' Those were sweet, bright days, Hermann, were they not?"   HELEN CO URTENA Y.       101 "Ah, yess he sighed, not conscious how he was probing and lacerating her heart-wound, and too self-absorbed to notice the flush of pain upon her face, "I was proud of you then, Annie. You have recalled a beautiful memory." "Yes, Hermann, only a memory," she said, tremblingly; "and do you not remember, too, what you said laughingly at the time; you said-perhaps you were not in earnest though--I believe that I love your beauty, Annie, more than you,' meaning the spiritual, soul part of me. Do you remember ." "I had forgotten," he said, evasively, withdrawing his hand from hers. "But I have not, Hermann; I remember every word you have ever said to me in your life; and I love you so well, my best beloved," she continued, with passionate em- phasis, " that I am going to do something for your good. Look at me, Hermann; ; am I handsome now? Tell the truth, turn your eyes -this way and answer me. I must have the truth." The truth! he could not tell it, and was silent. "'You know, Hermann," she continued, changing her tone of command to one of most loving entreaty, "that this evening I was to have been your wife. Think of it, dear love, your wife-a place, more to be coveted than to be a queen near the heart of a king. Oh, for the sake of what I might have been, answer me only one word, yes or no; am I lovely in your eyes now . " She stood straight before him; he could not escape the scrutiny of the child-woman, stronger in her helplessness than he was in the (might of his perfect manhood; some- thing must be said, but he hoped to gloss it over by subse- quent softening words. "No, Annie; but--" "Belle Burton is," she said quickly, interrupting him; "we both know it, you and I, Hermann." Standing before him still, with her tender eyes bent searchingly upon him, she could see the red blood flush his face, and that he cowered and trembled beneath her look. "Yes, she is beautiful, Hermann," she continued in a     102       HELEN COUR1TEWA Y. dreamy tone, as though repeating in words what had often been her thought; "her hair, with its raven tint, parted smoothly over her brow; her lustrous black eyes; her dimpled cheeks; her rosy lips; her graceful, rounded fig- ure; her soft, tapering hand; her arched, pretty foot-I think you love her, Hermann; I think you love her beauty well!" "Annie! Annie " he cried impatiently, "your words take the shape of an insult almost; to what does all this lead? Why so needlessly torment yourself and me?" "And she loves you, too, Hermann dear," she added, not heeding his interruption; "I have seen it long; I saw it when she first came to this neighborhood soon after our troth was plighted, and she looked upon your glorious beauty; daily since then has the knowledge of it been forced upon me; but I have said triumphantly, ' He is not yours, he is mine, my own;' but- later, in this darkened sick-room, when I beheld her eyes so lovingly turned upon you, and yours not able to meet unmoved the tender glances; when I have witnessed the glad look that you bent upon her as the hour for departure came, preluding the little form of taking her home-you could not help it, Hermann, darling; it was natural, of course-then in my loneliness I have said yes, the old apple-woman is right- beautv should mate with beauty; you and Belle belong only to each other." The young man's head had been gradually drooping lower, until at length his face was hidden in his hands. He was convicted, and dared not deceive the truth-loving girl, to whom he could not utter the words " not guilty." It was true; Belle Burton had woven a spell over him with her fascinations which could not be dignified by the name of love, but which, together with the knowledge gained from her that she was passionately attached to him, brought his every sense under her siren-like control. "And now, Hermann," said Annie, her voice growing softer as the knife entered deeper into her soul, "I want to know one thing more. Look upon me as your sister, vour friend; for you know, dear, that what I am quite separates me from what I have been-this frightful wound   'HELEN CGOURTENA Y.       103 severing us two for ever. Did Belle ever say that she loved you? Has the language of her eyes ever found voice upon her lips? Beneath the stars, in her homeward walks, has she ever laid her hand trustingly in yours, and said': 'If Annie were not what she is, your promised wife, then would I take her place and be all, everything to youP' Answer me, Hermann; I ask from no idle curiosity, only for your good. Oh, dearest, by the memory of our past blissful hours, by the thought of what we might have been, by my soul's future peace, answer me." Thus appealed to, Hermann, with face still downcast, answered, "Belle loves me, Annie; she has told me so; but I am'still bound to you. You must be my wife; you have promised it." "Annie Lovell, the beauty, promised it,", was the reply, "not Annie Lovell disfigured by a scar which has altered the expression of her face and made quite another person of her." Then a cunning smile played about her lips, like the smile of the insane; and who can say that the tried and weary girl was not wandering in mind under her trials as she added: "So you see I have proved to you clearly that you belong to me no more. You are Belle Burton's; she must be your wife." The knife went deeper and deeper, cutting away every obstacle-nearer and nearer the life-seat of that devoted heart; deeper and nearer, because a glow of delight he could not hide from  the eyes that for so long a time read him  so well, flushed the face of her affianced hus- band. "And so you discard me," he said at last, in a tone not devoid of reproach; "you deliberately send me off to find comfort with another. You are cruel, Annie, and only one supposition can sanction your conduct: from some cause you have ceased to love me. You are very glad of an excuse to be rid of me, now and for ever. Confess it; is it tot so?" The girl thus addressed grew as pale as death, for which she would gladly have exchanged her painful life; her eyes closed, her hands had a convulsive motion, every pulsation of her heart was a throb of agony; but Hermann, with his '. I  '     104       HELEN COURTENA Y. head still bent downwards, and full of his own thoughts, neither saw nor heard what was passing. He was, however, aroused from his position by a laugh. It was a strange sound then and there. That, certainly, was no hour for mirth; but mirth it unmistakably was. "I always gave you credit for great penetration, Her- mann," said Annie, after her unseasonable burst of merri- ment had subsided; "but you have surpassed yourself to-night, and come nearer the truth than ever. How deli- cately you have spared me from those last parting words attending a ruptured engagement! From what a world of anguish you have saved me! Now I shall not be obliged to utter that dreaded sentence, 'I love you no more,' be- cause you have said it for me. And then how happy it will make me to think that one whom I esteem so much will be blessed in a congenial marriage. Then opportu- nities will be afforded me of returning Belle's many good offices. You must let her know, now that I have no further use for it, that my trousseau is at her service; and, Hermann dear, you must bind the same wreath you gave me-how gloriously she will grace it-around her beautiful brow; then upon her breast I will fasten my orange love- knot, and upon her head my bridal veil. Lastly, though my name is engraved upon it, and I cannot part with it as a gift, you must use my pretty silver service, and some time when you are brightest and happiest, set a chair for me at the little table it will adorn. Have I not arranged a most brilliant programme, Hermann?" "Are you in earnest, Annie?" said her companion, at length aroused and confronting her. "Is it your wish to break our engagement?" "Certainly," she answeRed, with unusual solemnity of tone and manner; "but, Hermann, you must not remain here another minute. I feel so weary, so strangely, stu- pidly weary, while everything in the room is assuming curious proportions, and the air grows terribly close and heavy. Good-by, Hermann. Here, take my hand and bid me farewell in that old lingering way of yours. No, do not stoop to kiss me; my face is scarred, you know Good-by. Stay, Miss Clayborne-"   T HELEN CO URTENA Y.       105 But Helen stayed not; for, following Hermann from the room, she arrested his attention with an imperative ges- ture in the little entry, and grasping his arm, led him without the utterance of a single word to her own apart- ment. Listening a moment, she heard the same murmur of words that had before attracted her, and glancing out, saw a repetition of the same scene which she had awhile ago beheld. "Look, young man," she said, " at your future bride." Hermann leaned from the window, and there was that beautiful face beaming with love for other eyes; those hands clasping other hands; that tapering waist encircled by another's arm. He seemed to be in a dream, gazing long, long, incredulously; but, convinced at last, then he tottered back from the window and met Helen's rebuking gaze. "Hermann," she said solemnly, "you have made your choice. There is your bride, beautiful exceedingly, with every outward adornment that your heart could desire, but deformed within by deceit, coquetry, lies; for, with her vows to you still fresh upon her lips, she finds a refuge in another's arms. And what have you relinquished for her? God of heaven, what  The purest, most devoted, most loving heart in His giving; a love which is worship, be- cause it has sacrificed its own welfare for yours-even stooping to deception that you may be happy. Ah, Her- mann, you have left an angel for a breath of vanity-a poor deceitful and deceiving woman, whose beauty is her most potent charm, and who has lowered herself almost as deep as her sex can without positive crime. The one will lead you to heaven; the other-but you have made your choice. Go, and be happy." If Hermann cowered beneath that piercing gaze, it was but for a moment; his nobleness had not entirely forsaken him, and though passion had swayed him, he was fast re- turning to his lost uprightness, and he met her angry look with a lofty brow, though his cheek glowed with conscious shame. "Heaven bless you, Miss Clayborne," he exclaimed, " for your timely aid; I am saved, and by your intervention. 5*     106    t   IELEN C O URTEAS I'. Spare not your words; curse me if you will, but take to your heart the comfort of having saved a fellow-mortal from a terrible sin." "And Annie!" said Helen, with a thought for her poor suffering friend. "If she would receive me," he answered eagerly, " if she would take me back, I would return to her now and ask lier forgiveness. I love her, I swear it, more than ever; the blight upon her beauty fades into nothingness by the lus- trous brightness of her pure soul. Oh, that I could gain her pardon and be restored to her favor once more!" "Come, then," said Helen, impulsively; "let us seek lier." She led the way, and Hermann blindly followed that imperative will until they reached Annie's door. It was partly ajar, and she was in prayer. 'They saw that she was kneeling, with her face bowed in her hands. "I thank thee, Father," she said, " that he is happy; I would have given my life and all that is mine to make him so." Hermann could resist no longer; he broke from Helen, who, fearing the reaction for Annie, tried to detain him, and approached the kneeling girl. She saw him raise her up and encircle her with a strong protecting arm. "I have come back to you, darling," he said, " never to leave you again. I love but you in the whole wide world- my own, my bride, my wife!" A strange look of amazement flitted over Annie's face, succeeded by an expression luminous with the tenderest love. "And do you indeed love me, Hermann?" she asked, in an incredulous tone. "Have you forgotten this?" No, he had not, for he bent down and kissed the offend- ing mark. "Ah, dearest," he murmured, "I love you, yourself and your noble heart, better than all the beauty that was once my boast. Have you entirely forgiven me, Annie?" The scarred face was laid softly against his breast, and Helen knew by the glad look interchanged between them that there was peace in those loving hearts. Peace I She turned away with tearful eyes to her lonely   HELEN COURTELNA Y.        107 apartment, and looked deep down into, her own unquiet heart, in which, alas! there was no peace; none-for a stormy life lay before her, and even on the threshold there were clouds and adverse winds. But Helen's work for that eventful evening was not yet over. As she reached her room, she heard the entrance door open, and Belle Burton stood before her with a smiling face and a song upon her lips. She was later than usual, she said; some extra embroidery had detained her. Her dark hair was freshy smoothed over her beautiful brow, while a white rosebud hung pendent from its green stem on her bosom. Among her locks she had entwined a few bright green leaves; her lips and cheeks were coral-red, and Helen almost lost forgetfulness of her deceit in the lovely vision. She was passing on to her friend's door when the young actress confronted her, and bent a look upon' her from which she could not escape. "Belle Burton," she said, "follow me." Belle did not for a moment think of resisting her tone of command, and with the song hushed upon her lips and her eyes down-drooped, followed our heroine to her own- apartment.                     r Closing the door, the two stood before each other. Haw different they were; the one in her sable robes, pale, solemn, and collected-the judge; the other in her kaleidoscope beauty, varying every instant, flushed and confused, giving furtive glances from beneath her dark lashes, and tearing apart the leaves of her white rosebud-.the judged. The painful silen'ce lasted a few seconds and 'tthen Helen spoke: "Are you happy, Belle " she said; ' you look so ; but are you really so-? I mean, have you a clear conscience to-night? If your Creator called you now this instant to His presence, could you say: ' I am ready, because I could go to Him with the thought of being free from sin V " A bright blush was Belle's only answer, crowriing her beauty as heat lightning flushes anew a gorgeous sky. "You were seen in the alley-way this evening by other eyes than God's, Belle," said Helen, pointing to the win- dow.     108       HELEN COURTENA Y. The spell of silence was over, and the frightened girl threw herself on her knees before Helen. "Oh, Miss Clayborne," she said in accents of despair, "then you know all about it; I forgot that window; for heaven's sake keep it secret from my mother, from Annie, from Hermann." I shall promise you nothing, Belle," answered Helen; "but you must promise me everything, and answer my questions, or, as there is a higher tribunal than an earthly one, your name shall be a by-word for deceit. That man- does he love you? Do you love him? Are you going to be his wife?" "No," faltered the kneeling girl, " he is too proud, too high in life to choose a sewing-girl for a wife." "Then it was simply your fatal love of admiration that led you to meet him there," said'the monitress sternly, "to do what you did, to lower yourself in his, your own, and other eyes; oh, Belle, Belle, I have not seen much of the world, and I am as young as you are, but I feel in my soul that what you have dcne is in itself culpable beyond measure, and that it may lead to a grievous sin." Helen spoke in a solemn and warning tone, and lower and lower drooped the head of weak Belle Burton. "Is this his first visit to you " she asked again. "Yes," was the scarcely audible reply. "Is he coming again, Belle?" Helen was answered by her companion's silence; but the former had decided that his first visit must be his last. Placing pen, ink, and paper before Belle, she bade her sit down and write at her dictation. "Come no more; it will be useless. I am sorry that I met you at all; I do not desire to see you again." Then, bidding Belle sign, direct, and seal the note, and somewhat mistrusting the weak girl's constancy of purpose, told her that she would see herself to its safe delivery. Helen glanced once, twice, thrice at the name inscribed upon the envelope. She had never seen it before, nor did it interest her at the time; yet this mechanical and unconscious study of it so impressed it upon her mind, that when later she saw it signed in bold characters beneath a document ad   HELEN COURTENA Y.       109 dressed to herself, with a coronet for a seal, and a liveried lackey bearing the note to which it was attached, she shuddered and remembered well where, how, and when she had seen it before. "And now, Belle," she continued, when the missive was all ready to be delivered, " what about Hermann? Are you not proud of your conquest there, and of trying, by your mean arts of coquetry, to win him from your friend Con- fess it; was it'not a glorious achievement? I cannot let you go before I give you proof that your hopes in that direction are vain. Even at this moment Annie and he are together making plans for their wedding-day. Poor deluded girl, see what you have gained, for Hermann has discovered your duplicity. The word failure is written upon your plot from beginning to end." A fresh burst of tears almost prevented Belle's utterance. "How you have gained your knowledge I do not know," she sobbed; " but you read me through and through. I am sorry for what I have done, and will strive in future to be more and more like dear Annie Lovell." "Write again," said Helen, not yet relaxing from her unnaturally harsh tone, while Belle mechanically obeyed. "DEAR ANNIE: "I have tried to ruiljyour happiness, but I have not suc- ceeded. Believe me, now in the hour of repentance, I am glad that I have failed. Take me back as your friend and I will strive ever to deserve a privilege so great. "Yours, in sorrow and penitence,  "' BELLE." This Helen deemed but right in order to restore things to their old harmonious footing; and ii after years, far away from her humble London home, her thoughts often wander- ed to that little life-drama in which she bore so conspicuous a part-Annie's terrible accident; Belle Burton's-faMal beauty, her Weakness and remorse; Hermann's -slirt-lived apostasy from one whom he loved so well; Annie's self- abnegation and reward; and lastly the happy, happy bridal. Not long before the wedding-day the kind physician     "O       HELEN COURTENA Y. came to pay his last visit to his young charge. That he was kind was plain to each and all; for though he had been unremitting in his attentions, he refused any compensation for his services, alleging that his attendance ought of neces- sity to be considered in the light of mere courtesy, since he had not been called in as a physician, but had obtruded his services helping to lift Annie after her fall, and unsolicited had borne her home, continuing his visits up to the present time. Besides, if they did not consider his reasons as valid, he begged them to accept his professional calls in the light of a marriage gift, which no one had a right to dispute; and so, in a pleasant way, peculiar to himself, he convinced the thankful family of his sincerity, generosity, and desire to serve them. Sometimes when visiting his patient, Helen would be seated with Annie, book in hand, studying her parts for the theatre, as the hour for her debu6t was near at hand; or, when Dr. Percival lingered longer than usual, and the con- versation turned, as it often did, upon the stage, closing tho volume and giving her whole attention to a subject of so. much interest to herself, she graduaily advanced her opinions freely and fully on the topic under discussion. Often, too, in passing through the little conservatory leading from Annie's room, he saw Helen busied among the plants or with her friend's feathered pets, and stopped for a moment, to admire the graceful attitude which she unconsciously assum- ed, or to listen to the low murmuring song coming almost insensibly from her lips; for the voice of the birds, the many-hued flowers, and the grateful shrubbery, brought to her a memory of her happy childhood's home, and glad- dened her otherwise saddened spirit. And they had always a cordial recognition for each other or a few words in passing, he appearing to feel as if further conversation would be obtrusive to one so quiet and retiring, and she concluding that one so high in life as a wealthy and success- ful physician, could have but little in common with a poor struggling actress who had not yet won even a name. But on the day when he came to say that his attendance was no longer required, the barrier of reserve between them was somewhat broken by a little circumstance in which Annie   \ , IIELEN COUR TEiNA .      1" u iconsciously played the most prominent part. Her room had no longer the appearance of belonging to an invalid, for as she had been forbidden to walk more than chuld be avoided until her ankle had regained its entire strength, by certain adornments of the friends it had assumed the aspect of a cheerful parlor. The white curtains were newly loop- ed with bright blue ribbon, and the mantel was decked with gayest flowers. Upon a table, in the centre of the roomn Helen had placed a bouquet of peculiar beauty, using allhIer skill and taste to combine and contrast the various colors, and in placing it there she had called it playfully her last offering to free Annie Lovell. The physician entered as gravely as usual, but a smile lighted up his face as he looked around upon the bright aspect of the apartment. Helen was deep in a volume at her favorite window, and after greeting the phy- sician, bent over its pages again. "I have not come as much to visit you professionally," he said to Annie, " as to bid you good-by, for soon-why blush?-you will be a good man's wife; in all :probability I shall lose sight of you in your new home and avocations; you will then court forgetfulness of him who, in twisting and untwisting your poor ankle, has given you so much pain." "I shall never forget you," responded Annie with feel- ing, her eyes filling with tears as she thought how devoted he had been, and how constant in his attentions. "I was saying so to Miss Clayborne just before you came in, and she too remarked that she would remember your generosity and kindness for ever." Helen, deep in her book, hearing her name mentioned, came forward and asked Annie if she desired anything. No; she was only telling Dr. Percival that Hermann and herself would always consider him their friend; and that she, Miss Clayborne, had said that she thought him one of the best and kindest beings in the world. Helen thus drawn from her retirement, face to face with a stranger, and unable to plead "Not guilty" to the charge of havirg called him "the best and kindest being in the world," was somewhat taken by surprise in the novel posi- tion. But she had said it, and would not, if she could,     "2       HELEN C0 URTENAY. recall it; for in her heart of hearts she felt it to be true. She was silent then, betraying her embarrassment only by a blush, painful in its intensity, that flitted over her pale face like a glow of torchght over snow. "That was a delicious word you uttered just now," said Dr. Percival, turning to Annie, with an evident effort to assist Helen to recover her calmness, "that word friend." He seemed to love to say it-it lingered like a sweet morsel on his lips-" it is all, everything. Sometimes I think that God made friendship after he had made love, improving upon his creation; for there is nothing on earth which my soul appreciates so fully as a friend. Love charms, fasci- nates, engrosses for good or evil; friendship ennobles, puri- fies, counsels: we are never blind in that as we are in love, and can tell the true from the false, the dross from the pure gold. God be thanked that I have friends, and that I can be friendly myself." Helen sighed unconsciously; he had drawn a picture from which, now that Annie was departing to a new home and new ties, she felt that she was excluded. Where could she, playing a part abroad and at home, look for such kind sympathy again? Annie heard the sigh and felt its mean- ing. "I shall not entirely forsake you, dear Miss Clayborne," she said, with a beaming look of affection; "Hermann and I will ever take an interest in your welfare; and others, I am sure, will see that you are not overtasked or wronged. You will be a friend to her, will you not, Dr. Percival " "Hush, you forget," said Helen, deprecatingly; "Dr. Percival has other employments besides befriending un- known actresses." But Annie felt that to serve Ida Clayborne would have ennobled a king; and she looked towards the physician for an answer. "I  ." It was all that he said then; what he meant to say, called upon so abruptly-whether to remonstrate, to promise, or to be indignant-they could not tell; neither did his face betray, for he drew his hand partly over it, shading his brow and eyes. It was a desperate moment, as awk- ward as a pause upon the stage when the prompter, through   HELEN COZURTENA Y.       113 sleepiness or laziness forgets his part; so Helen thought; but she was a good actress even then. Casting a look of reproach upon Annie ere that desolate "!" could be con- nected with a sustaining sentence, she diverted the conver- sation from the channel Which it had taken, by saying something about thq peculiar beauty of their favorite bouquet. "I was just thinking," said Annie, "of giving it to Dr. Percival as a parting gift, and a pretty offering for his wife's boudoir. Does she love flowers?" she asked ad- dressing herself to him. "Who? What?" he answered, looking up, "I have no wife; I mourn her, nevertheless, although she never had an existence, as one dead; for I see my life passing away, my hair growing grey and my face becoming graver, with scarcely an inclination to better my condition as they call it; and so I play, as the children say, that there has been such a person, and worship her as though she were living and breathing now. Ah! it would he hard to find a reality typifying my ideal consort. But I will take the flow- ers, since they are your arranging, and present them in form to the imaginary shape -sitting by my lonely fireside." "It was Miss Clayborne, not I, who arranged them; she is always doing kind things," answered Annie; "Dr. Perci- val can have the flowers, can he not, Miss Clayborne or stay, I will gather some equally as pretty, if she does not want me to part with them." Her light form passed from the room, and Helen and the physician were left alone. Almost as soon as Annie disap- peared he spoke: "Will you not add another kind thing to your life of kindnesses, and give me that bouquet?" he said. "Certainly, you can have the flowers," she answered, gravely; "Annie is so impulsive." "But I prefer to receive them from yourself," he replied; "will you be kind enough to take them within your hands, and to put them into mine, saying: 'Will my friend take these?"        . "I cannot, I have no right," she answered, " though not my enemy, you are scarcely my friend; friendship presup-     "4       HELEN   C0 URTENA Y. poses a nearer acquaintance than ours; you know nothing of me nor I of you." "Is there any one to interfere with my title to that office as I defined it just now?" he asked. ("' Friend '--another word for purity in thought and act, for counsellor, brother, almost-is there anv one to stand between you and me and say it shall not be . " "No one." "Then give me the bouquet and accept my friendship," he returned; "I do not ask you for yours until I have proved myself worthy to be its recipient. Stay; the simDle act of unclosing your fingers, gathering up the flowers, and placing them in my hand will be enough, without words, to make me know that you trust me." He might prove what? A friend, a foe, thought Helen. At another time that simple act would mean nothing; now it meant everything. She took up the fragrant blossoms one by one, deep, deep in thought, held them, and stood irresolute. He, meantime, was looking rather at the action of her hands than at her, while slowly and deliberately she lifted her eves to his face and prayed earnestly for power to read him through and through, carefully studying each feature as though she were reading a book, while his look was still bent down upon the flowers. At last a bright, natural blush suffused his countenance, the first since the long ago days of his boyhood-not of guilt, but of em- barrassment. Those intense orbs that he felt rather than saw gazing upon him with the earnestness of prayer and artless innocence, with something almost beyond mortality in their depths, affected him strangely, and, though he did not shrink from their scrutiny, he was conscious that they had passed the barrier of the outward senses and were looking down into his soul. Suddenly, and as if in self-defence against so powerful an agent in heart searching, he returned her earnest gaze. It was then that he truly felt the spell cast over him by her eyes, and he likened them to a beam from the light-fountain of truth. It was a moment of intense interest to both. Setting aside the mere external office of that part of man called   HELEN COUR TENA Y.        115 his " organs of vision," he felt that it was character that she was seeking after, and- the traits of that were to be deter- mined by a single glance of a single moment. On this slight examination she was to trust or distrust him. She decided upon the first-that war of looks ending in a dearly bought peace. "Feeble creature," he said, though not in words, " how dare you doubt me; why not accept my pledge as a guer- don of faith?" Said the other, in like manner, "Alone, defenceless, I dared to judge for myself." "Are you satisfied?" he asked, with questioning glance. "I  am  satisfied,"  was the voiceless answer, while Helen's eyes returned to their natural, every-day expres- sion. "Then give me the flowers," he said, in audible speech. And she gave them. Just then Annie returned, laden with her floral, offering. They are not so pretty as Miss Clayborne'sl but---" "Thank you, I am  supplied," said the physician.  " (GQd bless and keep you both.  Farewell." So saying, with his gift of flowers, his pledge of friend- ship, he departed. CHAPTER XI. A   DEBUTANTE? Envy her not, though she be young, fair, attractive, and brilliant. Even the world-renowned Rachel, educated for the stage, with power written upon her brow, and the light of success in her wonderful eyes, experienced a terrible. sinking of spirit on the trying night of her first performance; nor did the veil of terror lift itself until she felt assured that hers would be a victorious career. Nay, why cite her, when one .nearer to us, Anna Cora Mowatt, with a shield of beauty, talent, innocence, and the triumph of many nights to give her confidence, records the trials of     "6       HELEE  COURTEVA Y. a fateful hour when her brave heart grew faint, even though knowing that her audience were more ready to applaud than condemn. It was a gala week in London, and Mr. Bland, in ad- dition to his usual brilliant programme, had trumpeted far and wide the attractions of a new and mysterious star. Helen was quite prepared for her parts, and there was no reason for further delay; besides, even if her path lay through fire, she had deliberately chosen it, and it was too late to dream of retracing her steps. Two plays had been selected from her repertoire for her debuzt, an arrangement quite contrary to custom, but into which she had entered because the manager had offered her an additional sum for so doing; and as the poor child's desire for accumulating money had now become almost morbid, she readily con- sented to the innovation. Moreover, Mr. Bland had assured her that a contrast of characters would, with certainty, add to her fame for the coming season, stamping her at once with the seal of genius and originality. Helen, too, was not averse to trying to please and conciliate the autocrat of the green-room, since, by Annie's advice, she proposed to act for Mr. Bland for two nights on his own terms-the first for a trial, the second for the result; and after that, if her playing was a success, to require arrangements more favorable to herself, particularly if she drew brilliant houses and became popular with the public. She had completed the preparatory rehearsals with ex- emplary patience, bearing the mistakes and awkwardness of the subordinates like a stoic: not, indeed, deserving great commendation for this, because, as a novice, there was a certain degree of excitement to herself attending her appearance even in private upon the boards of the theatre, which is far from being the case when the reputation of an actor is established, the only pleasurable emotions then being the applause that crowns the night exhibitions. But to Helen the whole was fresh and peculiar. The eventful morning at length dawned, but no sun struggled through the London mist, and when our heroine arose and repaired to her curtained window, it was only to see that a frightful storm was raging, with not the slightest   HELEN COURTENAY.        117 sign of abating for hours, perhaps for days. One steady, unbroken sheet of rain poured from the heavens, and a shrill, searching wind blew wildly about the building. It was not, after the fashion of some breezes, a merry boister- ous breeze, daring her to come out and face it, and ight her way onward step by step, glad in hei heart for a hal- lenge of strength; but a cold dismal wind, that VGept in gusts through the crevices, and followed her about mys- teriously as she moved, lifting the hair from her brow, fanning her cheek, and whispering unmeaning secrets in her ears. That driving, pitiless rain, beating relentlessly against the house, shutting out the neighboring buildings from her view, denying her even a glimpse of the heavens, and that weird gust with its gnome-like mutterings, were by no means calculated to give her any bright hopes for the coming night, or to raise her spirits to battle against her natural fears. She longed to frame some excuse-sudden illness, an entire inability to play her part-anything that would serve to absolve her from her engagement until the stars shone once more to guide her on her dubious way; but a most attractive advertisement, upon which the mana- ger had expended all his talents in bill-making, met her view, as it lay upon the table;-and her own assumed name, Ida Clayborne, in characters larger than the rest, proclaimed to her and to the world that the bond could not be can- celled, that she was no longer her own mistress, but the slave of an exacting and fickle public. And still the rain poured in torrents, increasing instead of decreasing towards nightfall, at which time, unattended save by her faithful Mary-for Annie had gone upon her bridal visit to her new relations-Helen proceeded to the theatre, the scene of her future triumph or failure. Driven through the darkness in a close London coach, with a flood of water above and around her, an impatient coachman in attendance who was half blinded by the rain, urging on his horses almost beyond their speed, our heroine felt so utterly forlorn and helpless, that not even the drenched and miserable newsboy who offered the programme of her expected conquests for sale, could he have seen her shrinking and frightened in a corner     "8       HELEN CO URTENA Y of the vehicle which bore her onward, would have envied her, or thought of calling a being so insignificant a star. But at length there came a pause, and drawing her cloak more closely around her, she took shelter under a friendly umybella offered to her by Mr. Bland, who tried, but failed to say an encouraging word about the weather, while he lifted rather than led her in. Most of the actors, who were already assembled behind the scenes, disencumbered of their uncouth rain-protecting garments, were inclined to smile when the slight figure with wrappings came in among them; but their smiles quickly changed to looks of deep interest as Helen's coverings fell, and she stood before them with her mysterious air of command, bowing with grave salutation to the company. Her almost solemn manner, joined to her youthful appearance, the perfect arrangement of her stage costume, her willow-like and symmetrical form, her eyes literally burning with excitement; their quick, restless action, compared with the immobility of her other features, made curiosity their leading thought, for they longed to know how the self-sustained girl, alone and friend- less, would comport herself before a critical audience, whose minds were raised to the highest pitch of expectation. If they imagined that her self-possessed exterior beto- kened a like calmness within, they found that they were mistaken; for the first step that she took towards the " star dressing-room" to make some slight additions to her cos- tume, showed them the contrary. A faintness, a near approach to that well known ailment-a "stage fright," overcame her, and her arms were mechanically stretched out for support. She was conscious that assistance was offered to her promptly by many who surrounded her; likewise that her hands were held with a gentle and firm support by one to whom the rest gave precedence, while a voice, most kind in its intonations, addressed her as she was led aside: "Are you equal to it?" The tone and the presence of him who spoke gave her confidence, for in the interlocutor she recognised Annie's physician, Dr. Percival. "Almost, yes; or I shall be directly," was the answer;   HELENO CO URTENA Y       119  ' but even while speaking, she shivered from head to feet not with cold, for her cheeks wer burning, but with a chill of fear. "It is a more trying ordeal than 1 imagined, and you must think me very weak, even imbecile, but I cannot cannot help it; struggle as I will, something stronger than I gains the mastery." "Stay,' said Dr. Percival gently, detaining her as she reached the door of the apartment; "listen to me for a moment. If you think that it will overcome you-and truly the end is not worth this unnatural effort, this warring of mind and body, this forcing one's nerves to do something beyond their capability, it is not too late to retract. ]Em- power me to say the word, and I will tell Mr. Bland that you are too ill to act-utterly unfit for the exertion, and that he must substitute some one in your stead. Once more, it is not too late." tHelen-almost yielded to his persuasive words; she felt then that she could not, would not be an actress, a target set up for a crowd to shoot at, arrows often poisoned and heart-piercing. Her limbs were stiffening; she grew icy cold, then almost stifled with heat, looking with a helpless stare into her companion's face, while hearing the dreaded appeal of an audience impatient for the uprising of the curtain, sounding to her in her excited state like the crash of doom. "Trust me," he said softly and almost tenderly. "I would encourage you, but I see that your state is beyond that of encouragement, and any confidence that you are to feel must come from yourself-an internaf recognition of your own powers of endurance-not from others. Were I to say: Be calm; there is not much to dread; be courage- ous; it would avail nothing: such phrases would fall upon your ears like a dead weight of unmeaning words; but when I say trust me, if you feel that it is beyond your strength, give me leave to put a stop to this; to speak for you as a friend, a brother, a father--" That was the last word of his unfinished but kindly meant sentence; for, with a force which in his eyes seemed almost supernatural, she broke from him, and closing the door, emerged, a few minutes after, a changed being.     120       HELEN COURTErA Y. "I am ready now," she said, meeting Dr. Percival's as- tonished and inquiring glance; and in her voice and bear- ing were power, endurance, determination; her limbs seemed nerved with fresh vitality, her head was upraised, while her step was the footfall of a conquering empress. The weak, corpse-like girl who had stood before him a while ago a subject for sympathy and pity, he beheld now in the very perfection of life, the jewels on her breast flash- ing not more brightly than her proud and glorious eyes. The physician looked and mused; he had met no parallel case in his extensive practice, and his far-seeing judgment and lifelong experience were valueless to him then. But could he have known her history from her birth to that hour, he would have recognised the touch that had given life to the marble; the spark that had fired the statue; the key to the mystery of the transformation; the word that shaped her destiny. "Lady Macbeth, you are wanted," said the call-boy. "I am ready," she said again, and the debUtante went forward to meet her judges. Though every seat in the theatre had been taken, Helen's uplifted eyes did not meet the brilliant array she antici- pated. There were many who cared not, even for the pro- mised treat, to brave the fury of the elements on such a night; the audience, therefore, was mostly composed of theatre-loving men, habitues or hard-featured critics, of which there were two classes-one who went to recognise talent, should there be any display of it; another, if there were anything to condemn, to do it loudly and without any mercy, deeming it a duty to put down false pretensions of all kinds in order to preserve the purity of the drama; considering it their mission to guard with vigilance the enchanted ground. They could not be deceived or imposed upon-assuredly not; potentates in their peculiar sphere, Mr. Bland ever stood in dread of their frowns, nor did he dare to brave their sneers and disapprobation by introduc- ing upon his boards any actor who was not above medi- ocrity-and these were to stand umpire upon the merits or demerits of the manager's new luminary, who, according to his own account, was to blaze athwart the London sky with   HELE  COURTENAY.       121 a brilliaitcy almost before unknown. Thus our heroine was denied the sympathy of many of her own sex, whom the severe inclemency of the weather kept at home, and who might have encouraged her by their approbation, excusing her failures for the sake of her youth; also the support of the herd of fashionable young men by whom they were always surrounded, praising only what was commended by their fair companions, whether worthy or not of admiration. She was greeted, as a debutante always is, with applause, in- creasing or growing less in proportion as the acting is suc- cessful or otherwise. Those dreaded theatre accompani- ments, opera-glasses, were raised, and Helen was inspected from head to foot; she heard a murmur of words, but neither knew nor. cared what their significance might be, simply doing and looking her best for the sake of that word which had so transformed her, sounding in her ears far above the din of the deafening applause that greeted her after a pause in her first stage utterances. She felt that she was an actress, and for what? That she might redeem a death-bed promise. Then to impersonate the thing she aimed to be, those eyes bent upon her to praise or condemn were forgotten; the theatre walls became a palace; she was Helen Courtenay no more, but a cruel, blood-thirsty woman, while her identity was lost in the character she portrayed, making what was fiction in the play blend int happy union with its historical truth-clothing the per- formance with graces and cunning devices unthought of before; so that the ideal became to the spectators a terrible reality, and Mr. Bland triumphed in the success of his won- derful protegee. The critics spoke but to praise; mere lovers of physical beauty as developed in the new favorite, looked but to admire, and the curtain fell for the' last time on the brilliant afterpiece, notwithstanding the compara- tively small audience, amid such a- unanimous burst of approbation, that Helen was half frightened at the storm she had helped to raise. An hour later and she was at home, sleepless and excited. That was won for which she had been so long toiling-a name and fame; but she was not satisfied, praying for Annie Lovell's calm temperament, her fitness to go quietly upon a 6     122       HELEN COURTENA Y. round of duties, her placid soul; forgetting that they were not made in the same mould any more than were the light- ning and the soft west wind. And so the dreary night brightened into morning that found her still in an unnatu- ral state of unrest. The day seemed longer to her than the hours of darkness; she could busy herself about no occupa- tion, longing for, yet dreading her second appearance before the public; everything compared with that was tame; her existence was vague and shadowy, time a torment, since the hours passed so slowly away. Then when her heart weighed within her bosom so heavily that it seemed too great a trial to bear it along with her, and her temples throbbed, and her hands, dry and feverish, trembled like those of old age, she forced herself to sit down calmly to thought and reason. It was too late, too late for the conclu- sion to which she came, but which any one with judgment could have predicted. "Alas!" she said to herself, " this life might suit some natures, but not mine. Constitutionally I am unfit for it. Mtany there have been dignifying the name of actress whose private lives have exhibited a round of usefulness and charity, and who have been good wives, mothers, friends; but for me, these days of idle thought and nights of bewil- dering excitement, leading to no sweet, calm self-commun- ing; this wearing out of the spirit in expectation, is not the right thing, the best thing; and yet, to my clouded mind, it is all that I can do-and I will do it;" and she added fiercely, with a wilder light in her eyes, "I am a fool to quarrel with my own choice; it was I who made the path I am following; alas, was it I?" Helen's next performance was a repetition of the same plays enacted upon her first; and the day, as if in contrast with the preceding one, was brilliant even for foggy Lon- don, boasting an unusual display of sunlight, while the night was all that Mr. Bland, in his most exacting requisi- tions, could desire. In the meantime, Helen's fame had spread through the city, and had the manager been able to gratify all applicants for admission his boxes would have been thrice filled. An imposing assemblage met to witness that rare phe-   HELE  CO URTENRA .123 kIi   nomenon, a perfect actress. Bouquets were in requisition from every florist; beautiful women shone resplendent with jewels, themselves a parterre of living flowers; and the dense crowd awaited with eager curiosity the appearing of the young dd6btante. Thus there was no drawhack to helen's success if her acting deserved it. The residue of the dramatic corps was unexceptionable, and, with the prestige of her former triumphs, she pmade her second appearance. In selecting the play of Macbeth, many who had not been present on the former occasion were inclined to think that the new aspirant for public favor had been too ambi- tious in her choice; for of all dramatic impersonations ever undertaken, that of the chief female character in this play requires most patient study in voice, gesture, gait, and, as has been observed, in the management of one's very eyebrows. Helen was cognizant of the difficulties with which she had to contend, but having a just estimation ofher powers, felt equal to the part to be sustained. To some minds there is a certain fascination in taking a low position and gradually rising above it. Helen's t eory was different: her standard' was the highest--her aim, never to fall below it; and thus it was that she had fixed upon the grandest creation of the grandest master of profane literature in the world. Her life upon the stage did not giveher the least concern; the trial once over, she knew that she would meet her own expectations and those of her audience; but the trouble was in the reaction--her life away from it. The reader will remember that Lady Macbeth does not make her appearance until the fifth scene of the first t, and then enters reading a letter.        act, What seemed to strike the audience at first was the extreme youth of Helen, who, nevertheless, enteredwith entire self-possession, scarcely replying to their hearty ap- plause, in fact almost indifferent to it, and entirely bent upon doing justice to the character she was personifying; they soon, however, lost sight of her seeming inexperience and unfitness for her great part as she read the missive in a clear, commanding, and melodious tone. This, added to the grave, womanly air assumed by her, the look of fore- thought and superior judgment, and her scorn when speak-     124        HELEN C01URTENAY. ing of her absent husband's nature, "too full o' the milk of human kindness," the imperative uttering of what she has planned for him to accomplish, left scarcely any doubt on the minds of those who listened to her that she appre- ciated and understood her role. Or if there were a linger- ing suspicion even then of her ability to sustain herself, it completely vanished while she spoke the terrible soliloquy following the letter, where she seems to be goading herself on to the fiendish plot. The actress shook off her youth as though it had been a garment, and stood before the au- dience a realization of their best conceptions of a Lady Macbeth, nor was there one within the compass of her voice that thrilled not with fear and horror as she invoked the aid of the supernatural in her murderous design. "Come, come, you spirits That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here; And fill me from the crown to the toe, top-full Of direst cruelty I Make thick my blood, Stop up the access and passage to remorse, That no compunctious visitinigs of nature Slhake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between The effect and it I Come to my woman's breasts And take my milk for gall, you murd'ring ministers, Wherever in your sightless substances You wait on nature's mischief Come, thick night, And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell I That my keen knife see not the wound it makes; Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark, To cry, Hold, hold!" Next, from the purely tragic and horrible, she made a graceful transition to the scene where, half in tenderness, half in triumph, she greets her lord, revealing that she is a woman to be loved as well as obeyed, a fact that the audience did not lose sight of throughout the entire play, feeling that the " dearest love" applied to her by Macbeth is a token that his heart is hers, even while he executes her terrible will. She is the wife of his choice as well as a hellish instrument awaking the worst passions of his na- ture, and in this combination lies the secret of the queen's power. Had he loved her less he would not have obeyed her so implicitly ; there is something besides ambition mov-   HELEN CO URTENA Y        125 ung him to murder; it is a desire to retain the affections of his cruel but beloved consort. Lady Macbeth is generally represented on the stage as out of the province of love, but Helen conceived the cha- racter differently, and the affectionate, caressing, and most' persuasive tone with which she ended the dialogue with the words, Only look up, clear" to her vacillating and doubt- ing lord, was in itself a masterpiece of acting. In scene sixth, act first, Helen preserved this idea with complete suc- cess, showing herself to be a wife of whom even a king might be proud, exhibiting the qualities of an elegant and self- possessed hostess, a finished woman of the world, who could royally receive royalty; and in this mood she orna- mented herself with a thousand nameless refinements of manner, that gave to her fresh fascinations, as the breeze, lifting the pliant leaves, gives additional grace and beauty to the tree; and this phase continued in the chameleon-like actress until she is led out by the unconscious Duncan, her doomed and deceived guest. When the curtain rose again, Helen's whole identity seemed changed; the woman has become the demon. Thirst for power has made her greedy for blood; putting her wife- nature far away from her, she is simply a fiend urging on her weak partner to a cruel deed, until in trembling tones, afraid of the sound of his own voice, he says, "If we should fail!" In her answer," We fail I " in the utterance of those two words alone, Helen proved her genius, the energy, the power of her will. If roses at her feet were a type that she deserved more than words of praise for her performance heretofore, a crown would have become her then. Thunders of applause shook the house. Once, twice, thrice, she es- sayed to finish the sentence, but was interrupted with a continued display of entire admiration. Her fortune might have been gained by her emphasis on those two syllables alone. Once again, in the next scene, she appeared with a new expression upon her face, one of cunning, and the thought of a purpose artfully achieved. "That which hath made them drunk, hath made me bold,"     126       HELEN COURTENAY. Lady Macbeth says in low, triumphant tones; and in the continuation of this stage-picture, Helen again won golden opinions in her efforts to shame Macbeth's trembling and cowardice, from the commencement of the dialogue until the words that show so unmistakably her master-mind: "Infirm of purpose! Give me the dagger." But the crowning gem of Helen's portraiture of her favorite character was reserved for the supper scene, where she has the double part to sustain-the lady-like hostess, careful of the comfort of her guests-and the watchful wife, upon whom it devolves to shield the strange behavior of her husband from their view: LADY MACBETH. Sit, worthy friends; my lord is often thus, And hath been from his youth: pray you keep seat; The fit is momentary; upon a thought He will again be well If much you note him, You shall offend him, and extend his passion; Feed and regard him not." This, with a sudden change from well-bred politeness to a low, indignant, warning " aside" to her husband: "Are you a man?" and then her excuses for him, showing her infinite tact once more in explaining his unaccountable behavior: "You lack the season of all natures, sleep ;" completely disarmed the critics of their venom, and won them to herself. In act fifth, scene first, there was a stillness among the audience almost painful in its intensity. The gifted actress swayed them  at will; every passion was asleep among them; every sense dormant except those of hearing and seeing, as though each had a personal interest in the opi- nion of the medical attendant, who comes in at the call of the gentlewoman to prescribe for her mistress's malady. She was beyond expression striking in her white vesture, a dream of troubled moonlight, and deserved acclamations from the spectators, if only for her graceful bearing; but not a hand was raised for fear of breaking that magic spell   HELEN COURTENAY.         127 of sleep-walking. One felt sympathy, mingled with horror, at beholding her fear, her anger, the hollow lines about her face of care and sleepless fights, the petulant, trembling tone in which she deprecates the blood-spot on her hand; the caution, even in her unconsciousness, against discovery; her disgust that the odor of blood will never, never cease; and at last, her half-human, half-elfish, crazed, heartrending cry, ending in a howl of self-pity that all the perfumes in Arabia are powerless to sweeten her "little hand." And still the silence deepened.  Lady Macbeth is a character to be feared, hated, scorned, but in this last scene she deserves our pity, at least so Helen conceived it; and scarcely an eye was dry as, holding her taper, she dis- appears with measured tread; and our heroine felt in her inmost soul, while leaving the stage, that the greatest tribute of approbation yet received was the stillness of that vast concourse of people, their rapt attention, and their awe. It is remembered that the leading character does not appear again in the play, and Helen was most glad of the interval of rest for her overtasked powers; most grateful, too, was she to the manager, who, after that painful lull had been succeeded by repeated calls for her reappearance at the end of Macbeth, represented to them that she begged their indulgence, as the after-piece was soon to follow. In)the space of time between the plays Helen desired to remain entirely undisturbed, and telling Mary when she would need her presence for her fresh toilet, retired to the dressing-room, and in the brief time allotted her while a favorite danseuse was exhibiting her gymnastic powers, her tired body and mind found respite and refreshment in the sweetest sleep she had known since childhood, weary nature asserting her outraged rights and demanding rest. It was therefore with a buoyant step and lighter heart, after that delicious repose, that she prepared for her new efforts. The play of the Honeymoon, Helen's next,selection, scene second, act first, opens with a conversation between Balthazar and Volante concerning the approaching nup-     12 8       HELEN COURTENiA Y. tials, in the midst of which Juliana, the bride elect, enters in her wedding-dress. Turning to Balthazar, she says: L "Well, sir, what think you? Do I to the life Appear a duchess, or will people say She does but poorly play a part which nature Never designed her for? But-where's the duke?" Helen's proud, imperial air, a worldly-wise Lady Macbeth no more, but a capricious girl, using her power in a way peculiarly fascinating; her simple look of wonder that the expected duke was not already there to meet her-brought forth a unanimous shout of welcome from the audience. It was a glad, cheerful sound, and even the countenances of the spectators seemed changed; there was no longer the deep, painful interest of the preceding play, but they wore a happy look of pure enjoyment, as if the sun had suddenly shone in among them, scarcely understanding where or how she had left or put away that terrible woman's frown, or how to account for the fresh radiant face of the charming maiden before them. In her first performance she had been a cold and haughty queen even to them, scarcely recognising their homage, but now contrived to enlist them in her cause, so that each was indignant, in common with her, at the in- sult she was receiving by the non-arrival of her lord. The pret. ty by-play, a wheel within a wheel, was eminently successful. Balthazar curtly answers in reply to her question, "Not come yet." "Jul. How? not come? The duke not come? Vol. Patience, sweet sister; oft without a murmur It has been his delight to wait for you. Jul. It was his duty. Man was born to wait On woman, and attend her sovereign pleasure I This tardiness upon his wedding-day Is but a sorry sample of obedience. Bal. Obedience, girlI Jul. Aye, sir, obedience I *   *   *   *   * Bal. He comes. Vol. Smoothe your brow, sister. Jul For a man I He must be one not made of mortal clay, then."   HELEN CO UR TENA Y.        129 The careless air of indifference with which Juliana meets her promised husband, and the confidence Helen had established between herself and the audience, was as effective as though in an " aside" she had asked them to bear witness of her. wrongs, leading them to look for rare acting in the continuation of the comedy. Nor did their expectations fall short in the next scene, where the duke introduces her to her future home, a miserable cottage, instead of the pro- mised-palace. The dialogue thus commences between the happy couple: "Duke. (Bringing forward a chair and sitting down.) You are welcome home. Jul. Home I! You are merry; this retired spot Would be a palace for an owl." After the enunciation of the word home and a glance at her elegant bridal attire, the young actress broke forth into a peal of laughter so gleeful and natural that no one could resist the contagion of her mirth; but ere the smile died away from  their fades, the deep scorn of her succeeding words enlisted a new set of feelings for the insulted bride, and when at the end of the scene Juliana, though entirely in fault herself, in a headstrong passionate way declares her intention to rebel against her husband, every heart went with her in the declaration as though she had not promised to love, honor, and obey. "You shall know me For a right woman, full of her own sex, Who when she suffers wrong, will speak her anger: Who feels her own prerogative, and scorns, By the proud reason of superior man, To be taught patience, when her swelling heart Cries out revenge!" Every one is cognizant of the fact that one of the chief attractions to the popular mind   in theatrical representa- tions lies in the different costumes worn by performers; and that Rachel, the modern muse of tragedy, wedded as she was to the severe simplicity of classic plays, whenever she desired to stoop to gain the applause of the people, 6*     130       IEL ENV CO URTENA . chose from her repertoire those characters in which a fresh interest was excited by a change of dress. The vulgar taste is fed by variety, color, action, and this may be the key to the enthusiasm greeting Helen when she appeared in the wonderfully becoming peasant's guise in the cottage scene of the Honeymoon, with her altered mood and supposed compliance to her husband's will. Her feet, hands, and arms, of faultless proportions, were seen to great advan- tage ; and her softened and tender manner to her tyrant lord, beneath which lurks an artful scheme for procuring her liberty, touched many other hearts besides that of her jailor, who consents, even though he distrusts her, to re- lease her, saying: "You are free, But use your freedom wisely." In the next act Juliana is announced to the mock duke, her husband in disguise, as having come for her wrongs to be redressed; still in her peasant's kirtle, she enters and relates her sad story with the air of a dethroned queen; yet bearing marks of her rapid flight from her persecutor-her bosom heaving, her eyes now turned anxiously towards the door, as though fearing pursuit; then gazing around with a proud glance, secure of sympathy in the righteousness of her cause; and at length resting them with the full light of their surpassing brilliancy, with a look of entreaty, mingled with command, upon the duke her judge: "I come, great duke, for justice." Then follows the recital of her wrongs, detailed by Helen in an earnest child-like way; next her indignation when slie is told that she must continue to live with the tyrant; and lastly her sullen compliance with the terms proposed. These quick changes from pride to the assumption of a humi- lity that she does not feel, and then to that angry mood of forced obedience, were worthy the genius of a practised actress whose home, so to speak, is on the stage; while Helen's greatest charm was her naturalness, and the glimps-   HELEN COURTENA Y.         131 es she gave, even through the most intricate parts, of her individuality, her own fascinating self. There is a passage in this play, in one. of the cottage scenes, that conveyed the idea mentioned before, of Helen's making a study of single words, and thus rendering them as effective as long sentences. It occurs after she has learned to love the guiding hand that has so long re- strained her. Her lord says, hardly confident of being obeyed: "I should like to see you in the dress I last presented you. Jul.-The blue one, sir'?" The manner in which Helen uttered those simple, almost unmeaning words, was like music to the ear, as with eyes cast down and submissive air she defers to her husband's will in the minutest particular; and once again, where tell- ing him -penitently and lovingly that she thinks of her promised rank no more, except "Sometimes in my dreams." Then came the finale where the plot is intricate; but Helen felt quite at home in the difficult task, that of con- vincing the incredulous father to whom she has complained of her unhappiness, of her now devoted love for her hus- band, as well as to assure her once despised lord of her dread and repugnance at parting with him, even for a mo- ment; her surprise and bewilderment at finding in the judge the duke; her astonishment at discovering his high rank, and finally her entire subjugation to his will. All this was so well counterfeited, and won for her so en- tirely the favor of all classes among her audience, that they could scarcely await with patience the conclusion of the scene where a dialogue between the minor characters ends the play, to applaud with increasing furor the young and interesting girl who had made them forget their personal cares and sorrows in spending a happy evening, made so simply by herself. The pageant being ended, Helen, with her constant     132       II3EL CO 0UR ITNA Y. Mary, attended by Mr. Bland, sought her carriage; but here, something not anticipated by the former arrested their homeward progress. The young and most enthusi- astic part of her audience, determining to pay continued homage to the star of the season, had taken the horses from her carriage, themselves intending to draw her vehicle through the streets. This Helen, anxious and annoyed, wished if possible to avoid; and taming to Mr. Bland, re- quested him to signify to them that they would honor her most by allowing her to depart as she had come; but the manager was too proud of her popularity, and too well pleased with the idea of the striking paragraph such a pro- ceeding would make in the morning prints, to exert himself much to interfere. Helen then looked around in vain for her friend Dr. Percival; but he had been called away just before the closing scene, and with tearful eyes she renewed her prayers to Mr. Bland to use his influence over her too officious admirers. He either would not or could not arrest their purpose; and Helen was giving up in despair, when a gentleman who had followed her closely from the green-room offered to assist her in her present emergency. He was apparently a man accustomed to command and to be obeyed; for mounting the box of the coach in order better to be heard, he stated to the crowd gathered below that he was empowered by Miss Clayborne to say to them that she was most grateful for their evident wish to do her honor, but begged leave to decline so public a display of their approbation; and desired them to leave her to the quiet she so much craved. This had the intended effect; and because it was her wish, and not because of him through whom she had expressed it, Helen heard them say they yielded; after which she had the inexpressible satisfac- tion of seeing them disperse from the neighborhood of the theatre. Helen's advocate then conducted her to the car- riage, and before she could arrest his intention told her, in order to be sure of her being unmolested, he would take a seat with the coachman and see that she reached her home in safety. When they arrived at Helen's humble abode, he stood ready at the door of the carriage to conduct her in, but   HELEN COURTENA.     .    133 there was something in his manner, in hiS patronizing, almost affectionate air, from which she shrank as from a poisonous atmosphere. Nor did the few words spoken by him reassure her; bold words, expressing admiration of the woman apart from the actress; a remonstrance against her occupying so miserable an abode, when far more elegant ones were at her service, and the assertion that life would be unbearable until he met her again. To all this Helen answered nothing; she knew not what to say, and took refuge in dignified silence; then, at last, thinking it might be the custom of men of-a certain stamp to exaggerate their meaning, blaming herself for her pru- dery, and half indignant at her own coldness when she remembered that he had been of use to her, and that she had accepted his interference in her behalf, her manner became less distant, while blandly inquiring to whbmp she was indebted for a kindness that she was powerless to return. The name that he gave was that of a nobleman near to royalty; but the man's rank and influence were as nothing to Helen, for they brought up memories filling her with trembling and alarm, and with scarcely a " good-night " to her escort, she hurried from his presence as the dove flies away from the swoop of the descending hawk. Then came another night of restlessness; the door of slumber was shut for her and she knocked at it in vain. Again and again the conviction was forced upon her that the life of an actress was entirely unsuited to one of her temperament. Nervous and excitable, she lay longing for, yet dreading the dawn.  Always, in former times, her watch, a gift from her father, had been a pleasant companion to her, acting upon her like a lullaby with its monotonous tick; but now the unoffending tone assumed the propor- tions of a giant's voice, mocking her with strange, fearful words; every noise made her heart beat with an intensity unknown before; the tramp of a horse-foot in the street caused her to cover her eyes as though she were about to behold a fearful apparition; her nerves were completely unstrung, and never more, she felt assured, if that artificial life was continued, could they boast of the same healthy     ] 34       HEL E   CO UR TEA Y. condition that had been theirs in her happy country home. There was, however, one luminous spot in her mind pre- servinog her finom utter despair-the thought of the interval between that night and her next performance; and in her heart of hearts she blessed Annie Lovell for the respite. On the morrow, Saturday, Mr. Bland would come to make new arrangements for the ensuing week, and between this and then lav a Sabbath day. And in the watches of that night Helen thought of the Christian's privilege as she had never thought of it before. Heretofore it had been a good day; a pleasant day, and a day for the meeting of friends around her father's hospita- ble board; but now it was to her, as she looked forward to it, a day of rest. Its significance came to her vividly in the sleepless hours. She likened it to all bright and happy things; to the pause in a storm at sea; to a lucid interval in anl attack of insanity; to a sick child's sleep on its mother's breast; to the memory in a life filled with sin of some holy act of charity and virtue. She gathered in imagination all the Sabbaths of her past, so carelessly spent- gifts from God's hand recklessly thrown away. Then, from regarding it only as a time of rest, in itself most useful to mankind after a week of toil, her mind wandered on in its meditations to the true meaning-a season for prayer and praise; a landmark towards which the Divine hand was ever pointing, while a voice, heard alone in the soul, uttered through all the week-day hours words sounding above all other words: Remember that thou keep it holy I Thus it came to pass that Helen's first religious experience grew out of the wild exciting vigils of those weary hours of watch- ing and despair. At length in the day-dawning, when others were arising, with the great city-voice murmuring in her ears, her wake- fulness was conquered, and sleep came to her tired brain; but even in her dreams she was tormented with unwelcome fancies-some fiendish power changing her to a struggling vessel out at sea, against which the waves were dashing and the winds battling, tearing away mast and rigging in their fury, when, quite unseaworthy and abandoned by all, the   IIELEN CO UR TENA Y.       135 waves parting engulphed her, while sinking, sinking for ever downwards, she found no resting-place, even in the- waste of water below. "The dream and the reality are not unlike," said Helen Courtenay with a sigh, as she awoke from her troubled slumbers. CHAPTER XII. AFTER a refreshing toilet, and when the excitement and nervousness of the preceding night had passed away, Helen found'her heart lighter than it had been for some days. She did not look forward .to the future, but was content with the security of the present, enjoying inexpres- sibly the thought of freedom for herself, her hands, her feet, her heart, her mind. Since Annie's departure she had surrounded herself with many little home cares, which from their very simplicity were a source of pleasure to her. After her morning repast, repairing to the so-called conser- vatory with her usual song of the olden time, she -arranged the flowers and cared for the birds, talking to them the while in glad whispers, forgetting for the time that she was a great actress, who had caused the pulse of the fastidious public to beat with a quicker throb, and that every morning journal detailed in trumpet tones her popularity and her triumphs. She was not,/ however, left long alone, for according to the agreement planned by Annie's forethought, Mr. Bland's agent called to make the " little arrangement," so he termed it, about the proceeds of her two performances, and Helen found herself in possession of what seemed to her an enor- mous sum of mi ney to have been earned by her individual exertions. The agent also informed her that Mr. Bland! desired him to present his congratulations to her upon suc- cess so extraordinary, and that he would call himself in the afternoon to rriake new terms, which he hoped would entirely satisfy iMiss Clayborne, and to plan programmes l     ' I     -'     13       H EL EN COUR TENA Y. for the ensuing week; and the man of business departed. Then Helen fell to musing over the money so mysteriously her own by the discipline and study of a few months. She had often anticipated that hour, but the reality was deli- ciously fascinating. Out of herself-her brain-had ema- nated the power to create gold. The coin assumed fresh importance in her eyes; her own importance was enhanced; she did not weary of counting and recounting the precious hoard. And who will deny the glorious excitement attend ing the first proceeds of industry! The worldly lawyer, enriched by a thousand fees, reading the faces of men like pages in a book, acquainted with all the motives of crime, half doubting if there be such a thing as virtue in the world or the self-satisfaction of a generous impulse, still smiles when he recalls the fresh delight that stirred his pulses as he gazed upon the well deserved remuneration of his maiden speech. The busy merchant, a millionaire by self-denial and toil, though in his palace-home, still remembers his first speculation, and that the gold gained thereby glittered more than the countless sums that have since been his own. The grey headed physician, in elegant ease, after a life of toilsome practice, will tell you with a satisfied air, as he counts his honest gains, that none of his treasure is so attractive as that which was the result of his first medical call. So, likewise, the author cherishes in some remote hiding-place the veritable dollars sent him as a return for his first poem, tale, or essay, and shows it with the old romance clinging to it-to his children's children. And so on through life, the delightful thought of those early earn- ings, when existence is fresh and hope and strength new, is a memory that one carries with him even to the grave. Not long after the door had closed upon her obsequious visitor, a letter was handed to Helen from her old friend, Stephen Gerald, that served to raise her spirits to a still greater height. He informed her that her affairs were in a most prosperous condition; the new investment of her property being more advantageous even than he had antici- pated, and he concluded by urging her, with the warmth of a privileged friend, to return and enjoy the fortune so rapidly accumulating. Instead of this, however, Helen,   i  EiHELEN COURTENAY.       137 with her usu impulsiveness, immediately wrote an answer to his commnication, forwarding to him, through her banker in London, the amount she had just received from Mr. Bland to be added to the funds in his hands. Thus our heroine had no cause to despair, as she mused over her business affairs; the thought that her property was increasing in value, that she would be able to restore to her father's ward his fortune; that she was quite able to support herself, furnish the income of the defrauded heir, besides adding occasionally to the principal of her inheri- tance, thereby the sooner gaining the desired amount, made her for the moment as buoyant and joyful as a careless child. The world appeared better and brighter to the young actress; even that dreaded life of excitement, now that she was for the present relieved from it, seemed of minor consequence, and she gave herself up to a delicious reverie, which was sweet because she was in a mood to think only of the happy circumstances of her lot. Helen did not belong to the "always occupied, always happy" school, but was content at-times to enjoy an indolent, oyster- like existence rather than that of the busy bee, the bughear of the nursery, who so faithfully employs " each shining hour." She had rebelled in her childhood against a law so stringent, nor could she yoke herself to it now. The morn- ing wore on to noon, and still in the Lovells' humble parlor the queen of the hour reclined, dreaming day dreams, with nothing more arduous before her than to enjoy to the full the luxury of idleness. The moments went unheeded by, and she cared not for the lapse of time; no tame rehearsal was awaiting her, no anxiety as to how she would be re- ceived by her judges made her restless and impatient for the ordeal to be at an end. With her hands clasped above her head in a position of perfect comfort, with her feet rest- ing upon a cushion of down, she lay curled in a ponderous arm-chair, a picture of rest after toil, well earned quietude of mind and body. How intoxicating was the idea of being favorably thought of by those dreaded critics whose uplifted hand alone could make or mar the reputation of an actress; how satisfactory the conviction that she understood the thoughts of the great authors whose characters she personi-     138       HELEN COURTE AY. fled; how delightful the assurance of being listened to with breathless interest by crowds of intelligent auditors; and lastly, how the mysteries of atstage toilet, from the slipper of a peasant to the crown of a queen, assumed new dignity in her eyes as being accessories to success; in short, how sweet it was simply to live! The door bell ringing imperatively aroused the dreamer, when Mary appeared bearing in her hands a package, with a direction in conspicuous characters to Miss Ida Clayborne. Her curiosity fully awakened, Helen unfolded the nume- rous wrappings of tissue paper, and discovered a box con- taining the most exquisite ornament that she had ever seen; it was a network of pearls held together by a multitude of small diamonds set in rings of silver, and the whole was so unique that Helen uttered a glad cry of delight, and with the glee of a child gazing upon a new toy, approach- ing a mirror, fitted the elegant coiffure upon her head. It suited her style so well, its glittering links showing to such peculiar advantage upon her dark hair, that it was impossi- ble for her not to look with something like admiration at the image reflected in the glass. In a moment after, how- ever, ashamed of her vanity, and heartily repentant at her remissness in ignoring the donor, she was about to summon Mary to ask the history of the wondrous gift, when a note, lying at the bottom of the box, attracted her attention. Helen ran her eye over the words thereon written, and though there appeared a signature in bold characters at the end, it needed not such testimony to tell her that they had been penned by her escort of the previous night, by pretty Belle Burton's twilight visitor. She had awaked in the morning with a soft flush upon her usually pale face, but as she read the missive it died away to ashen whiteness; her eyes looked vacantly around with an almost idiotic stare, her hands trembled, and not even as Lady Macbeth had horror been so surely the language of her countenance and mien. Just in proportion as her dream awhile ago had been satisfactory and placid, the reality now was fearful, terrible. "Is it reality?" she asked herself; "no, surely not, only a rehearsal of next week's performance." Then she murmured words, of which the following are an echo:   HELEN COURTENA. .        139 "O shame, shame, shame! that you, a nobleman, Should be so little noble in your thought As to send jewels here to win my love." But the truth came to her at last, as the paper, loose in her nerveless hands, fluttered to the floor. She saw it; she felt it; it was there; she could not evade the fact or the insult. She had thought herself ready for any exigency, but not for this; and she might have stood there indefinitely if her attend- ant had not reappeared to say that the liveried lackey who had brought the package was awaiting an answer. An answer! Ah, yes; Helen remembered that among other things the writer had inquired if he might follow his gift to her presence. It was imperative that something should be done; it was idiocy for her to stand like one turned to stone, in- active, in one of the most fearful crises in her life; and yet who could point out the way? Was there any rule in such extraordinary cases If there were one, she did not know it, and had only to follow the dictates of her own sense of propriety. Thrusting back the admired ornament into the box which had contained it, and replacing the note that had accompanied the gift, she wrote a few hurried words in reply: "I wish for no more of your protection than that which you gave me in my need last night; neither do I desire your gifts or your love. All that I ask from you is your respect; and to deserve that, I must respect myself.  This, together with the package, Mary delivered to the servant, and Helen was once more left alone. "Did I do right, did I do wrong?" she muttered over and over again as the door closed and reflection came. "Would not scorn have been better, ,ignoring the whole transaction; or did not that note warrant that the man who conceived it be tracked and silenced for ever by a stroke of death " She had had no guide or counsellor, only acting as it seemed best to her at the time, and her thoughts vibrated like a pendulum from one idea to another until 'she was almost wild; now feeling contempt of herself for     "O       HELEN COURTENAY. tracing a single line, and longing to recall what she had written; again regretting that she had not transcribed sen- tences that, like a ghost of evil, would have haunted him the remainder of his days. "Was it right, was it wrong?" she kept repeating, until, utterly wretched, she wished that the power of thought could be taken from her; then cross- ing her arms upon the table, she laid her weary head upon them, sobbing bitterly in her loneliness and woe. This, together with the excitement of the past few days, made her tired even of breathing; and, unaccustomed to the relief obtained by prayer, for she scarcely knew its lan- guage, she longed to lie down then and there in the quiet of the sleep of death. One thing, however, sustained her in her deepest despair, and that was the consciousness of hei innocence in word, deed, or thought; but the convic- tion forced itself upon her that a bad man had taken ad- vantage of her position to address her in terms which he would never have dared to use to her in the sanctity of private life. An actress! Thrice she repeated the word, and then all that was repulsive in the profession returned to her in full force. She forgot that the stage had often been a teacher instead of a destroyer of morality, good men and women adorning it with lustrous virtues; and tried anew to conjure up some fresh occupation to which she might turn as a last resort. While in this despairing mood the door opened softly, and Dr. Percival stood before her. As Annie's medical attendant he had always been at home in the little parlor, and now entered with the same freedom, forgetting for the instant that his patient no longer awaited him. Something in his face-pity, concern, interest, friendship-Helen thought, made her spring to meet him as he approached her. "Who has dared to say or do aught to offend or annoy you?" he said, half playfully, half angrily, as he saw the traces of weeping upon her face. "You are the very person I most wished to see," was her answer, looking with tearful eyes trustingly into his face; help me; tell me what else there is for me to do, for I cannot, will not act again. You, so calm, so sure, so true, can and must help me and find some other work for me."    HELEEN COURTErNAY.      141 A pleading child she seemed, trying to read the mean- ing of his tender, pitying look. What else can I do?" she asked again. Why he commiserated her he knew not; why his look was tender, that he well knew: he loved her, he had loved her long. "What do you want to do?" he asked, replying to her childlike look rather than to her emphatic womanly words. "( What are your necessities? Why do you work?" "Ah, yes," she answered thoughtfully, " it is but right that you should know why; I must earn money for myself and another." '"Another!" he said, with quivering lips. "Yes, another," she replied, in an emphatic tone; "I can do it; I have done it; there are other modes besides a theatrical life, I am sure, if you, with your large experience, would only point out the way." "Are you toiling for a father or a mother, a sister or a brother?".he questioned anxiously. "No." Then he left her standing where she was and looked away from her, with pained expression, through the parted curtains into the cheerless street; once or twice he turned to interrogate her, but the words died unuttered upon his lips. '"Speak to me," she said, following him; " let me hope that by thinking the matter over, something may occur to you. Mr. Bland will be here before many hours to arrange next week's programme, but I will not act again-I wil' kill myself first." She said it; she meant it. Her companion turned and looked upon her, the pleading child no more; the reso- lute, stern woman. "Miss Clayborne," he said, with more deference than he had ever used towards any human being, " will you tell me who this other is; can you tell me?" "No, leave me my secret sacred." Then there was a secret; he did not reflect that it was base to wring it from her; how could he, when the happi- ness or misery of his future life hung upon the result, and he ventured, with trembling lips and a wildly beating     "2       HELEN COURTENAY. heart, to ask another question, indifference in his tone, but the life or death of his first passionate, truly loving emo- tion awaiting its doom in his breast. "Perchance you are toiling for an absent husband whom you love with your whole soul, proving yourself a true helpmate indeed. Happy husband, noble wife!" "No such tie binds me," she answered, gravely; "is there nothing, nothing that I can do?" She was more eager than he desired to recur to the lead- ing subject of their conversation. Then he conned over a sentence to himself as though it were a task, and when he had memorized it, repeated it aloud. "Neither mother, father, sister, nor brother? What then? A lover-one affianced, to whose income, like Annie Lovell, you hope to add your own." At last he thought that he had lifted the veil of mystery. "No, no," she replied, almost angrily, " let such thoughts rest; only help me; time flies; decide for me now." Still he was silent. There was one other tie, sometimes dearer than all these to a woman's heart, he reasoned in- wardlly-but she was so young, so seemingly pure, he felt ashamed to ask concerning it, ashamed to think of it; and yet some demon thrust the notion into his brain and held it there fast, immovable. Is this devotion a mother's strong, intense love for her child? Such a thing were possible, and he remembered that he had met, in his long years of practice, parallel cases of youthful crime and duplicity. And if this were indeed so, then he bade fare- well to the brightest, best dream of his life-the dream of the vacant seat by his fireside occupied; the roses faded, but appropriated; the once empty place in his heart filled to that heart's entire content. This stranger, whose past was to him all unknown, had moved him to no visionary affection, no cold fancy which men sometimes call love, but to a fierce, undying, ennobling emotion, a union of earth's strongest passions with a purifying breath from heaven. And she, unconscious girl, waiting long for the forth- coming answer with eager eyes and parted lips, thought   HELEN COURTENA Y        143 that he, in his superior wisdom, during that long silence, was planning some work for her, and in patience still looked into his face, being sure that the result of his musings, whatever they were, would be what she most desired; while he, in his turn, felt like a man enduring a trial that would end in a joyful reprieve or a frightful death. The case demanded it-demanded that her soul be laid bare to his view, at least so he concluded, cheating himself with the idea that he was setting aside all other considerations, and acting as he would have done pro- fessionally, by first finding out the disease before he could venture to prescribe a remedy.      / Another I It was a simple word enough, but it had the power of swift lightning to slay. Standing before her and towering high above her, he gazed lovingly, hoping yet dreading, upon her, intending to probe her to the quick by a final interrogation which she would be forced to answer. But as he looked into her steadfast eyes, tranquil as two cloudless moons, and at her calm, unblushing face, the worldly-wise man was foiled, and the thought to which he intended to give expression skulked back as if ashamed of itself into the hiding-place where it had its birth. He felt that she was pure, nor did he need a single word to assure him of the fact. He cared not who that other might be-aye, more, he knew that her cause was a righteous one, righteous enough to make it his own, and to work with her for its advancement. The idea was inexpressibly sweet-that of laboring with her for some good end. He was aware that she was not per- fection, seeing her faults too plainly to give her the attri- butes of an angel; but he believed that hand in hand, if they could walk life's journey together, they could aid each other in the steep, perilous ascent marked out for mortals, and leaning upon each other, so strive for a better home. She suited him; he desired her companionship here and hereafter. Then, as the blessed thought filled his heart, and brain, and being with beatific visions of joy, a glad smile played about his lips, which Helen regarded as a happy omen for herself, and thanked him, before he spoke, for saving her     "4       HELEN CO URTEN AY from a life so unsuited to her temperament, and from which she was only too glad to escape. "Yes, I will save you if you consent, mysterious, fasci- nating child," he answered, gathering her hands in his own. "Keep your secret; it is no wrong thing. When I left my home I was quite as earnest to say then what I am about to say now: Leave the praise of many for the praise of one, and come to a fireside that needs you more than the world does; come and be my wife." Very solemn were the kind physician's words; very clear and audible; and to Helen they sounded like the grand melodious tone of a cathedral organ-rich, sonorous, soul- subtduing. "Yes, come and be my wife." Answer to words so benign, so heartfelt, she had not; it seemed that her own voice, in contrast to his, would have sounded like a shrill note of discord, and her reply was simply silence, a bent head, a closer pressure, denoting respectful gratitude, of his hands clasped with hers. She felt his nobility-deemed him worthy of her homage. He was a good man; God creates nothing so near Heaven as that. Then something beyond the name of joy stirred the innermost depths of his heart, and he sought to fold her in his embrace, and to call her his own, when her gentle strength severed him from her and kept her distant from his extended arms. "tHappy, happy at last," was the language of his eyes. "My search is over. The place in my home will be filled by a beloved presence. I have found rest." But Helen, regarding him gravely and anxiously, ventured timidly to tell him that she could never be to him what he desired; first, because she was pledged to accomplish a duty nearer to her; and even if that were finished she could not be his wife, because she could never love him as he deserved. To give him only a part of her heart would content him, he said; and breaking forth in eloquent language, he told her how she had won him months past; how he had watched her in retirement and in public, unspoiled by the breath of fame-his ideal of a helpmeet and life   HELEN COUl RTEN2A Y.      145 companion. As he spoke those words of passion, he was to Helen a changed man; the look of thought and care habitually his entirely vanished; the cold, haughty bear- ing he wore among men was laid aside, and he stood before her, and her alone, unmasked, or perchance only lighted externally by the flame of hope burning so brilliantly within. Now and then, in a lifetime, we unmask ourselves. Now and then we are to another what we are when alone: not as we appear in the home, except to a beloved husband or wife; for dearly as we love those who are bound to us by ties of blood, they seldom know us thoroughly. Only under peculiar circumstances does the veil fall from us, leaving our hearts naked, and only at such times can it be truly said that we live. And when two thus meet in friend- ship or in love, then is felt true friendship or true love, and then alone. But seldom does this perfect union of natures occur; nor did it now. Helen felt theglow of her companion's fire for an instant, as the iceberg reflects the light of a burning ship passing on its way; then she stood cold and impassive as before. "Listen to me," she said, sighing that she could not return affection so absorbing, "and be calm while I speak, because what I have to tell you will show you better than any protestations of mine why we must live apart. I have a cousin; in youth we were constantly together, and we loved, or thought we loved, each other. His heart was very near to mine, but his life, his intellect,- his judgment were, pardon me for my vanity, below my level. To love I must respect; we were unequal, therefore our marriage never could have been blest." "I know that you are above me," said her listener, mournfully; "there was no need for you to assure me of the fact." "No, I am not that," returned Helen frankly, truth beam- ing from her eyes; " nor did I mean you to infer it. The case with you is just the reverse of my cousin's. While I sympathize with you intellectually, I feel that our hearts are severed wide by the difference in our years and our ex- periences; neither could my marriage with you be blest." 7     "6       HELEN COURTENA Y. "We could find the same level, I am sure," he replied, grasping at the least comforting thought. "You, with a little effort, could reach up to my added years and larger experience, and I would bend down to meet you on the way; then our lives would blend with perfect harmony into one." "No, they would not," she answered, ready for his every argument; " and I will tell you why, so that you may fully understand my meaning. Suppose a case. Fancy that a day or hour found me in a great strait, needing counsel and help, and, while so wanting advice, praying for the aid I coveted. Fancy, in answer to my prayer, power bestowed upon me to call up a shape, a mind, a heart, and a head, gifted with all the qualities I most desired, that would tell me how to mould my actions in my necessity. Having such power, it seems plain to me that when I had invoked my ideal of a mentor I should find him your very self; and falling at the feet of the image I had created, I should say with perfect faith, not 'I love you, I love you!' but ' Help me, my friend 1'" He understood her at length, the light dying away from his face while he sat down, his hands covering his eyes partly that she might not see the foolish unmanly tears wrung from a crushed hope, and partly to endeavor in brief self-commune to dissipate by strong effort the charm that she had lent to his life. And thus it is that men naturally are more crushed than women when they love and are not beloved in return; they lay plans, they hope, they paint pictures in imagination which seem to them like truth, and then ask for what they have pictured; if denied, the shock is as great as a bereave- ment by death, for they, as it were, have tasted possession, their hopes taking the form of certainty; while a. woman who loves simply loves without hope, and if she cannot inspire affection has but to outlive one feeling; she has painted no pictures, nor has she dared to dream, but waits for the reality; and if that never comes, calmly lives on, with a sigh for the past, it is true, but not with the soul- sickness, the utter loathing, for a time of existence, that makes shipwreck often of the happiness of the other sex.   HELE1N COURTENAY.        147 When, however, there is at-engagement or marriage, and the first is broken or the last interrupted by death, nS the  woman who suffers most keenly; everything in the home: reminds her of the loved and lost; she cannot escape thought if she would, while men go abroad into the world and in excitement and change find what they seek-forget- fulness. As with bowed head and sorrowful attitude her compa- nion sat a little apart from Helen, she could not fathom the depth of the emotion that had taken such hold on him who had told her of his love. At best, it was but to her the kind prompting of a generous nature to rescue her from a painful position, a large kind heart offering her a refuge from the storms and trials of earth; and though pained at his evident disappointment, she was too full of her own troubles to dwell long upon his. The day was wearing away, and feeling the need of some decisive step, therefore, as he sat speechless, his eyes covered, his lips quivering with an inward struggle, the effort to rise above the passion meeting with no return, she echoed the words of the ima- ginary scene she had depicted: "Help me, my friend." He could not bear it, but held up his hand deprecatingly as if to ask her pity, and shrank from a repetition of the :   words conveying to him the death of hope. He was ashamed to be so weak, so powerless, thinking heretofore that he had thoroughly understood himself; in fact, self- knowledge had been his boast.  But now he felt that he knew nothing, for, conquered by an emotion, he was unable to rise above it. So likewise are others overtaken, when ,least expecting it, by the same experience. Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall; words as applica- ble next year as the last, to-morrow as to-day. Only with God's help may man say, "I can, I will." I know and trust myself, are words only to be written on shifting sands. Thus as the once strong man felt the new sensation of self-distrust overcoming him, he did not look up, but rather retired deeper into himself as he listened to her words. He loved her; Heaven could bear witness to the fact, and yet, strange, terrible infatuation, he feared that if he gazed into her face and met only calm friend hip answering to his     "8       HELEN CO URTENA Y. burning glances, he might have been tempted to strike her whom he so cherished dead at his feet with a fatal blow, so that the time might never come when for another she would feel the same passion that was consuming him. "Leave me for a while," he said at last with an effort; "I cannot, must not, have you near me; go out into the light among your birds and flowers; sing your happy songs, be gay and mirthful, forget that I am here; then when I bid you return I shall have determined what is best for vou; only just now speak not, breathe not near me. I be- seech you go." He pointed with imperative gesture to the door; and Helen, wondering at his mood, left him alone. Alone! literally alone; bereft of the joy of living, the sweet consolation of hope; alone to plot, to plan, to con- trive something for her welfare. And who but he could judge what her welfare really was? A cunning smile, for the first time in that good man's life, played over his face like the light from some infernal abode, and the tempter took possession of his heart. "She slall be mine," he said, rising and looking towards the door through which she had departed; " that beautiful enchantress has given herseif into my keeping because she knows that my judgment is good. London is a wide, a secret-keeping place, and well am I acquainted with its haunts, its homes, its hidden abodes. It were an easy thing to put her away in silence far from the tongues of men, to force her to love me, to win her by storm, or fail- ing in that, to lay siege to her heart by years of patient devotion, keeping her away from others, that she may be all in all to me." It was a bright idea, worthy of a fallen angel; his stature seemed to increase as he proudly trod the floor; his eyes glistened as in thought he pressed her to his breast and showered loving kisses upon her lips. Yes, she was his own, and in imagination he decked his home with the graces of household love; children gathered around him making it a paradise; the woman he so adored was near him day and night, night and day, a solace in sickness, a companion in health. She did not now return his affection,.   HELEN COURTENA Y.        149 it was true, but by arts and stratagems which men to his knowledge had used he could bend her as he chose to his will. Then he called her with a strange smile still upon his lips-the fiendish smile of sinful purpose. She came at his bidding and stood in the doorway, the green shrubbery behind her; the light striking full on her lithe, beautiful form; her hands clasped around a cluster of fragrant flow- ers, so fair, so fresh, that the picture was imprinted an eternal image on his memory. Long he gazed at her and ardently, with a dangerous glare in his fire-lit eyes, while she waited expectantly for his words. Still the demon look was there-lightning, ready with fatal aim to destroy. "Nearer," he said, beckoning. She advanced a step, the better to hear him, when a pant- ing, frightened bird, freed from a cage, the door of which Helen had inadvertently left open, flew from its perch into the room.  As it beat against the window-panes they watched it in wonder and curiosity, when, at Helen at- tempted to secure it, with impetuous flight it sped across the room, taking refuge with trembling wings and throb- bing heart in the bosom of her companion. "We, the bird and I, are alike," said Helen, earnestly, as she took it from his hands. "How? You fly from  me; the bird nestles in my breast," he answered, moodily. "We both trust you," she replied, softly; "God has taught us that by instinct." "Put your bird in its cage," he answered; "you re- turned too soon; I will call you again when I need you." Alone once more,! Not proud, defiant, and demon-like, but on bended knees asking for strength against tempta- tion; wrestling with prayer; battling breast to breast with a thought of wrong, like gladiator in bloody fight. The combat was fierce; the enemy all but conquering; the struggling man faint; but the victory, aided by a weak woman's holy trust in his integrity, all his own. When she returned again, he was standing grave and erect as usual, but the hope-light of his life had left him';     150       HELEN COURTENAY. his face was as the sky without the stars, the earth without the adorning hues of flowers ; and as he told her of his plans for her welfare, Helen felt as though she were in the pre- sence of a stranger whom she had never met before. "Am I right," he questioned, "in understanding that it is your intention to sacrifice now and for ever the brilliant career you have just begun; the golden pathway on which your feet rest-admiration, appreciation, fame 2 I require a definite answer, Miss Clayborne." "( If you mean in plain language to ask me whether it is my intention to cease being an actress, I answer as plainly, yes." "And yet, so you have told me, it is imperative that you receive a large income from your personal exertions." "Such is my need," she replied. "I trust, then, that it is in my power to aid you," he returned; "for, almost providentially, I remembered a while since a letter, received a few days ago, from an old and valued but eccentric friend. He is wealthy and liberal, and writes desiring me to endeavor to obtain for his two motherless children an accomplished governess as well as an every-day companion. To effect this object he offers an ample compensation to her who will conscientiously under- take the charge. Years ago his wife died, and he indulged in the Utopian idea of educating his daughters himself; but though he is a good and worthy man he lacks judg- ment, and while storing their minds with the classics and masculine studies, has sacrificed heart-culture for brain- training; and thus they stand sadly in need of a preceptress to modernize them, as it were, and to soften and mould them to the standard of what society requires in a woman of the present day. In a word, they are rather too inde- pendent of forms and customs. One of his plans was to cultivate their minds by constant travel. At present they are living in a castle not very far from London, which, as is sometimes the custom, he has rented from the nobleman to whom it belongs, who is making a tour-with his family on the Continent. Very quiet but very grand are they in their retirement, and if you think that the calm of such a life would be bearable after the extraordinary excitement   HELEN COURTENAY.        151 through which you have so lately passed, tell me candidly; and by writing a few lines to Mr. Drayton, I am sure that he would receive you at once." "And what could you say of me   How could you recommend met? We are comparative strangers to each other. 'What is this woman? What has she been 8' your friend will say." "As far as your talents are concerned," he answered, in the same calm tone, "I can vouch for your worthiness to fill the situation; a linguist, a musician, a scholar, would certainly find acceptance in his eyes; for the rest, I shall simply say to him if I had been so fortunate as to win you, instead of being his governess you would have been my wife." "Dear, dear friend," said Helen, springing to his side, "how can I thank you enough for your kind interest; but spare yourself the writing of those words. Say anything but that." "And yet it is the truth," he answered, with something like bitterness; " the terrible, naked truth. God bless you for those sweet monosyllables, even though they are a pre- fix to so cold a name. You would love me if you could, I know," he continued, in a tone that he tried to make gen- tle, yet with flashing eyes, the roll of distant thunder show- ing that though the storm had abated it was not quite overpast; "but since you cannot, keep far away from me lest some demon within me tempt me to crush in a first and last embrace that which I covet yet cannot possess. In your distance, just now, lies your safety. Stand yo there." With extended hand he pointed to the plae where he desired her to await his further words, und trembling at his stormy and changed mood, she obeyed his will. "I know," he resumed again, calmly, after a pause, "that Mr. Drayton will accept the woman who, of all other wo- men, I would have chosen for my wife; therefore, if you care to occupy the situation of which I have told you, pre- pare for it at once." "They may be prejudiced against an actress," answered- Helen, "and yet I could scarcely bear, if they are, to be ,^   , '  *c. -A R.'     152       HELEN CO URTENA Y pointed at as one who has followed a profession which they scorn. Thus you see I would be candid with my employ- ers, and still I should dread to be." "I have already considered that," he replied, "and am not astonished at your desiring to be true to your sense of right. The letter I intend to send to Mr. Drayton will be private; to him I shall reveal all I know of you; the knowledge must extend no further, and you will be saved from the thought that you are in a false position by the fact that you have made a confidant of the head of the family, and that he does not condemn you, for I can judge of my friend as though he were myself. Will this satisfy your scruples? if not, I will try to think of something else." "You always do just what is right," she answered; "how can I ever thank you enough for all your thoughtful care!" "In the meantime," he continued, interrupting her in her heartfelt burst of gratitude, " you must leave this house. You are bound to no one here. Mr. Bland's engagement with you expired on the second night of your performance; he will be here, you say, this afternoon, and you could scarcely bear the storm of invective he might hurl upon you for his disappointment. In a note, left for him, you can make your excuses as you think best. Another note to your banker must acquaint him that you are about to change your residence, and that you will let him know soon in what direction, so that you may regularly receive your letters from America. Then Mrs. Lovell must be told of your intention of leaving her roof; and to Annie, your good, faithful friend, it would be best to write a few lines of kind wishes and a farewell. Lastly, I will send a con- veyance for Mary and your wardrobe at the earliest possi- ble time, and you must be prepared to go with me to your new home when I return for you two hours hence." He had thought, with provident care, of everything; all that he left for her to do was to follow his directions. "Can you trust me?" he said, after a short pause, look- ing away from her; "you know I could easily take advan- tage of your loneliness, your youth, your inexperience, and   HELEN CO UR TENA Y.       153 spirit you away in this wide city, where you would never be heard of more." "Yes," she answered serenely, "I said it once, I say it again." Something like a sad smile played about his lips, but another thought quickly effacing it, his tone .was sarcastic and cold. "Oh, of course, you. will trust your ideal of a friend." Then he continued, more kindly: "And now farewell for a brief time. Mr. Bland will rave to no pur- pose when he finds that you have departed; the London world, quite used to sevent days' wonders, will soon find compensation in other stars, and you, like the rest, will be forgotten." Reaching the door, he turned and said sadly: "Do you pray often, Miss Clayborne; does solitude ever find you on bended knees asking Heaven to grant you a desired petition? If such be the case, pray this day that by some wondrous miracle the wound in my heart, my life, my soul's life, deeper than an ever-fresh sword thrust, may be healed; pray, that until I see you safe out of my path, I may keep, with God's help, my sacred trust." CHAPTER XIII. IT was not love, and yet love not more blindly follows the beloved object than Helen followed Dr. Percival's will. It was not love, and yet her strong, passionate nature was willing to be implicitly guided by his. She respected hini; she feared to offend him; his praise and appreciation were dear to her: and yet-- What is love? Who can define a passion so rarely felt; something almost a myth; the creation of a novelist or the romance of the past, for the, men and women of to- day are content to go through life without thrilling to the divine emotion, substituting a shadow for the reality. Upon the mortal whp can say in the wide acceptation of the word, "I love," a brighter light falls than upon the rest 7*     154       HELEN CO URTENA Y. of human kind. Life is enriched, the'common every-day walks of existence are smoother, the air is redolent with joy, the heart beats with fuller throb, because it has found that which is unknown to others-the gold in the mine, the flower in the arid desert, the star hiding behind the clouds. Envy not those whose lives are passed in luxurious case, breathing perfumes and lulled by Utopian delights, nor yet those upon whose brows intellect shines like an encircling halo; but envy those who, even if bereft of all else, can utter with truth those words, fit for the song of angels--"I love and am beloved." Thus, though in the young girl's visions, for youth is full of hopes, wishes, and aspirations, she had often beheld a picture afar off; radiant, ecstatic, to which she gave its pro- per name, the name of Love, not yet had she looked upon it face to face; and with the bearing of a sister following the counsels of an elder brother, she seated herself by her kind guide in the carriage which he had brought to convey her away. On their way to Helen's new temporary abode, he in- formed her that he had dispatched a letter to Mr. Drayton, and as the time for receiving an answer was quite uncertain, had made arrangements with a lady whose daughter was a patient of his, to receive her and her attendant until her plans were matured. Once in the long and almost silent drive, the wistful look that he had so prayerfully tried to conquer came back to Helen's companion. "Do you know of what I was thinking?" he asked, a faint smile illuminating his grave face; "I was thinking that the disappearance of so bright a star would leave me, far more than others, in darkness more gloomy than mid- night." There was a tremulous tenderness in his manly voice that brought tears to Helen's eyes, but she said nothing; what could be said to one beyond soothing-beyond com- fort? As well might she have spoken consolation to him who had just buried his beloved-dead; there is no conso- lation then, and silent sympathy is best; the sufferer feels it to be so, and is grateful for the forbearance. So likewise, Dr. Percival was grateful to Helen; for words from her   HELEN COURTENAY.        155 would have been but mocking, while her unshed tears soothed the wound they could not entirely heal. The home chosen for his young charge was at length reached. Mrs. Dearing, who had been apprised of their coming, greeted them with marked cordiality, and Helen found in bier almost motherly reception a happy respite from the ,eight that had fallen upon her spirits. She soon discovered that Dr. Percival's visits were gratuitous; and that his name in their household was ever spoken with reverence, while his coming was looked for as the brightest hour of the day. Subsequently, she learned that though the widow and her child had once been in affluent circum. stances, misfortune had pursued them since the death of Mr. Dearing. He had been a warm friend of the? physi- cian, and since his loss they would have been destitute and friendless, had it not been for Dr. Percivals. steady and untiring attentions. After commending Helen again and again to the care of his friends, and promising to see her soon, Dr:, Percival left; and Mrs. Dearing led the way to her daughter's room to introduce their new inmate to her invalid child. Julia Dearing had never known health since her infancy. A spinal complaint, with a complication of other diseases, had early marked her with the! doom of a perpetual valeti- dinarian, and she had become, from4 weakness and constant suffering entirely confined to her own apartment. With a mixture of curiosity and admiration, Helen found herself by the side of the patient girl, who, though full of earthly sympathies, looked with longing heart to a release from a world where she had enjoyed so little and endured so much. "I am glad to see you," she said, extending her thin, bloodless hand to Helen; " the more, because Dr. Percival has brought you. It will be delightful to have so much youth, health, and energy in ouy quiet home." Helen acknowledged her welcome gracefully, while look- ilg earnestly at the- face, and shrouded figure before her- so slight, so frail was she, though tall in stature, that our heroine thought it would be an easy thing to cradle the invalid like a child in her arms. Though perfect beauty     156       HELEN COURTENA Y was not her leading characteristic, the sight of her affected Helen with emotions that attribute could never have called forth. Her complexion was of surpassing fairness; her eyes large, brown, and luminous; her hair a rich aubur so luxuriant, that in its classic golden coil it seemed too great a weight for the spnall well shaped head that bore it. In health she would have been radiant; now with pale lips and paler cheeks, she was only chaste and fair, with a stamp upon her through which perfect beauty never shines-the seal of constant pain. It was seen in her blue-veined, trembling hands; it hung over her often drooping lids, or flashed from beneath them in the restless, fevered glance of her eyes; its presence was known by the white teeth pressed convulsively on her bloodless lips, in the sudden start and repressed moan, as though a nerve were probed with some sharp instrument of torture; in the red flush passing like a meteor over her passionless, calm face, leav- ing it whiter than before. While Helen looked with sympathizing eyes upon Julia Dearing, the latter was busy reading one whose gifts had called forth the homage of a fastidious public; and no greater contrast could have been offered to her fragile, weak self, than was displayed in her who now stood before her in all the pride of youth and strength. The one was an embodiment of health, not robust, rosy, -Hebe-like, but strong, agile, firm; her whole appearance betokening life, energy, will-of the earth earthy-quick, impulsive, with unregulated thoughts. A creature striving to do well; but often falling far short of her endeavors, realizing but in a small degree the overruling of a kind Providence; and yet with a sense of right akin to a sense of religion, learning life's lessons patiently with an earnest desire to be good and to do good, without precisely under- standing the full meaning of that broad mandate-the key unlocking the door to repentance: "Go and sin no more." The other had seemingly done with the world's struggles, as she lay serenely awaiting the termination of her sojourn on earth. One has said that the always healthy will find it as difficult to enter heaven as the man made callous by   HELEN C 0URTENA .        157 riches; and that pain and suffering are a nece disci- pline of life. If this be so, then had Julia De ri been purified, for her spirit no more answered to the breath of time and sense, than does the mirror held above he lips of the dead;, and as Helen gazed upon her, it Seemed as though she saw her soul. "I think that we shall be friends," said Jula, after a brief silence; " sit down, and let us begin our acc uaintance by talking of ourselves. I must tell you first, what we know of you through Dr. Percivals note, and from our own convictions, preluding what I have to say )y stating that we are entirely bound to secresy as regards your an- tecedents and surroundings. We know that you are the actress who has so lately carried our London world by storm; that from some cause you have become disgusted with the stage; that Dr. Percival, always kind qnd noble, is desiring to serve you because he sees and acknowledges your nobleness of character, and has applied to some friends to employ you as governess; that you have been Ida Clay- borne heretofore, or at least during your London life, and that if you do not still care to be recognised by a name of celebrity so wide, you are henceforth to be to us--" The young girl looked away from Helen's face, and turn- ing over the pages of a book, paused intentionally to give her companion full time for an answer. It was impossible to resist the cordial frankness of her tone and manner, and the charm of refinement that appeared to belong to her as perfume belongs to the rose. Helen understood her with that freemasonry with which some souls recognise each other, and half smiled at her tact and the delicate way in which she had displayed it. Poor Helen! She had ihdeed taken upon herself a life of vicissitude when pledging herself to be true to a death- bed promise. She dared not take her own name again, feeling certain that it would involve her in awkwardness at some future time, and, as had been hinted, that of her stage life had acquired a notoriety it was her earnest desire to avoid. She longed for some inspiration to aid her, as she felt sure was the case when questioned by the rough stage-manager; but' it did not come, and she felt utterly at     158       HELEN CO URTENA Y. a loss what to say or do. Then a yearning desire to be called by her own Christian name by one so disposed to give her a sister's regard determined her, and she delibe- rately arranged a cognomen with little effort, knowing that Julia Dearing understood and appreciated her position. "You may call me Helen-Helen Tracy," she said with a glad smile while uttering the almost forgotten word. "Then let us be Helen and Julia until we part," replied the latter, with something of solemnity in her tone. "The changes of an eventful life will sever you from me; but death, for which I have looked, and longed, and expected for years, perchance may call me away first. In the mean- time," she added more cheerfully, " let us enjoy each other until the summons for either comes. You, basking so long in the sunlight, will, I trust, not find the shade wearisome, and I in my darkened world shall only be too glad to dwell awhile in the light." The cold, wasted fingers of the sick girl clasped the warm, rosy palm of her new friend; then for a moment, and as though a deep shadow had passed over both, they stood mute and thoughtful; but soon, with the indomitable hope of girlhood, the sombre mood passed away, sunshine returned, and the hours sped rapidly as they conversed, after the fashion of other maidens, truly of almost every- thing under the sun. Woman's talk! how often has it been mentioned with scathing sarcasm, ridicule, and contempt, and how basely has it been calumniated! It is not always of folly and fashion, for deeper things than these lie beneath the sur- face. These may be the earth-crust above the whole for- mation-the loose sand covering the precious ore that lies imbedded beneath. Question a right-minded woman how such communion ranks among the gifts bestowed by God upon his creatures, and she will answer you in words some- thing like these: "It is sweet, it is pleasant to hold converse with those of my own sex. When deprived of the privilege long, I feel the want of it like the want of fresh air, and if it be not near me I go to seek it; when found, and of a choice quality, my soul is satisfied, I draw a long breath of content, and feel as if I had achieved a   HELEN COURTENAY.        159 g )od and healthy thing. To me the simple fact of sitting face to face with a friend, of holding her hand in mine in sorrow or joy, in fine of conversing with her, is a soothing antidote for trouble and care such as the adulation, the sympathy, or the passionate love of men seldom bring. The scorner may rest content in his false judgment, so that he take not from me the charming solace of woman's talk." With some such thoughts as these in Helen's mind, those daily hours of communion were most delightful to her; the presence of the pure spirit in which she suddenly found herself, acting upon her as one would imagine a mis- sionary's teachings would fall on a heart thirsting for truth and grace. She listened to and obeyed Julia Dearing with the docility of a child, watching her every motion, and striving to do nothing which would jar upon her sensitive organization. The secret of Dr. Percival's influence over Helen was his strength of character, while the other guided her simply by gentleness, lending to her something of her own tender nature. On the other hand, the light that the young actress brought with her she shed abroad in the household, and a happier, more cheerful atmosphere seemed to fill it than before. Mrs. Dearing, whose cares were made less by Mary's coming, was no longer worn out by house- hold duties and her unending attendance upon her daughter; while the sick-room, ceasing to be one of gloom, had be- come a busy, happy place, where reading, conversation, and even sewing assumed immense importance as the day was varied by each. It is something to have the gift of a happy tempera- ment, and another to shed it, as God sheds his sunlight, upon others. The world in itself is a wilderness-the moral light thereof not coming from the inanimate and stationary, but from the people walking on its surface; therefore to them it belongs to make their habitation a pleasant place to themselves and those around them-to scatter their ligh4 for they know not what corners of darkness it will pierce and illuminate, or what sorrowing hearts it will cheer. There is no calculating the power of a smile, a kind word, or a sympathizing tear; and who, planting a little seed, can     160       HELEN COURTENA Y.  tell what beautiful flowers may crown so small an effort! A smile-it may be recalled in the dreariness of midnight, making sweet the hour as an hour in Paradise; an .unfor- gotten word-it may cheer one through a lifetime as it did at the moment it was spoken; a tear shed for pity-it may imprison the light showing the way to a life of virtue. And Helen thus smiled, and spoke, and wept, and won her way to each heart within that stricken household. The invalid's room had become so attractive, that the physician lingered there long after his professional visit was paid; and though often moodily silent himself, enjoyed the conversation and reading of the friends. Julia generally selected works of a religious nature, and it was a rare treat to listen to Helen's finished elocution, uttering the sublime songs of the Psalmist of old, or tenderly enunciating the precious promises of One who invited the weary and heavy- laden to come to him for rest. Trained as her voice had been by close study, and under the teachings of an accom- plished professor, with a perfect appreciation of the beauties of every style of composition, and with an interpreter near her to whom every syllable was familiar, the books of sacred lore assumed a new meaning in her eyes, and her voice revelled as it were in the fresh pleasure, like a freed bird singing its sweetest songs in the delicious atmosphere in which it found itself. It is a picture on which to dwell. The white-robed invalid, passive, attentive, with closed eyes and clasped hands listening to the reader, her lips some- times moving in prayer or echoing the well known words- the reader herself swayed like a tree with the breezes by the new emotions she experienced, sometimes flushing with delight at a fine figure or choice language, and simply enjoying as a critic, but often trembling as a truth or a warning spoke its solemn language to her heart. A second listener not unfrequently sat somewhat apart, striving, but in vain, to resist the spell binding him to that little apartment, which kept him for the first time in his life neglectful of his other duties; but with the pertinacity of the moth and the candle in the worn-out simile-worn out, but entirely applicable to his case-he could not, if he would, have shunned the attractive flame. Each day   HELEN COUR TENA Y.        161 Helen's character unfolded to him in a more alluring light than the last; he saw how surely- the Christian graces were softening those little asperities he had sometimes noticed.; she was more subdued and less restless, forgetting the fevered past in the present, where there were no anxieties, and in Julia Dearing's presence feeling brave to meet life's coming storms. The dependence of the friends upon each other, though equal, was of a different nature; the blighted vine and vigorous plant growing together in perfect har- mony. Sometimes a glad thrill found its way to Helen's heart while thinking that she saw signs of recovery in her companion, signs as delusive as they were false; for though the patient girl had never longed so earnestly to live, yet never, when the agonizing hour of pain came to her, had she prayed so fervently to depart; for fiercer tortures assailed her, and she knew that soon she must bend pros- trate beneath their overpowering weight. But in all her terrible struggles, three angels always waited by the sick one's couch-Patience, Hope, and Trust; and when, in her paroxysms of distress, Helen beheld her kept in check by these, and outwardly tranquil, she took the lesson home to herself, wishing that a like guardianship might be hers through life. Her own troubles vanished like mist; self- abnegation, the giving up of wealth, seemed nothing in comparison with so much bodily suffering, and her strength' to endure was increased by the example of her cheerful but unfortunate friend. Sometimes in her hours of deepest agony, when the frail house of clay seemed too slight to bear the racking pains that were inflicted upon it, like blows upon some fragile structure, and when Helen wept at the sight of her heroic forbearance, Julia's voice, flute-like and tender, spoke words of comfort to others when needing them most herself; and often when her pangs were most unbearable, wreathed her face in smiles, a pardonable deception, as her mother ap- proached, fearing to anticipate some of the grief she knew would be hers when the dreaded hour at last arrived. But the time at length came when all her innocent arts were of no avail-the parting night and hour. She had been freer from pain in Dr. Percival's morning visit, more hopeful,     162       HELEN COURTENA Y. more childishy gay than they had known her for some time; but when he came again at night, an expression of surprise, as he looked at his patient, would have betrayed, had any one been observing him, that some new and unfore- seen change had taken place. And yet that blanched cheek of his was not because the alteration in her appearance presaged death for the weary invalid; he knew that to her it would be a happy release, but for another-for Helen. He had not counted upon this; he had not dreamed that between his charge and his patient so strong a tie would have grown to full maturity in that brief time, or that it would so soon have been ruptured. He hated the very idea of bodily or mental pain for Helen, though he was willing himself to live or die for her good; and he longed to bear her far away, to steep her senses in oblivion, to cause her to forget that he had brought her to that abode, since she might plainly trace her grief and the misery of the parting to him. His patient was lying in a species of stupor, bearing a resemblance to placid sleep; her mother, unconscious of any change, had retired for needed rest, while Helen, quite as ignorant, was seated apart busied with her own thoughts, and it devolved upon him to break to each and all who loved her that human aid was powerless to save. For himself, he knew that he would miss her gentle companion- ship and his daily visits; and now looking upon her, as he realized for the last time, he felt the saddest emotions at the thought of her departure, as she lay pallid, but heaven- touched and almost glorified by the purity of her soul. Through her woman's nature shone the spirit, the innocence of a little child. Few emotions had been hers in life; to fear she was a stranger, nor did she know the meaning of jealousy except as depicted in books; anger had never flushed her serene brow, because she had been always guarded by an ever-present ministration of affection; nor had she been tormented by those petty sins that make the lives of others unhappy. Love, as a passion, had never quickened her pulses nor thrilled lher with ecstatic bliss; no tie had held her to the world but a parent's love, and she had lived as much with reference to another sphere   HELEN COURTENAY.        163 of being as for this, her only temptation having been to repine against her afflictions, and these she had learned to bear. There was a fascination to. Dr. Percival in Julia Dear- ing's expression and her unearthly beauty as he thus thought of her. The golden tint in her luxuriant hair gleamed like a halo; her long lashes swept her cheek in a line of perfect grace; the pure oval of her face was like carved -marble; the constant presence of pain had, seemingly departed, and her wax-like hands, motionless as sculpture, were clasped upon her breast. "She will die, she will die," he murmured to himself; "she will float serenely on angelic wings to her native home, and Helen, Helen will be the sufferer." Impressed with this idea, he left the couch and went to- wards Helen with a view of telling her as gently as possi- ble what must inevitably be known at last, when a more sad- dened expression on her face than she usually wore arrested him, and'fearing to add another thought of sorrow to her apparent mood of grief, he stood gazing at her for a mo- ment uncertain what course to pursue. The moon was shining brightly, as it had shone upon Helen once before in her life. She was watching it, op- pressed and mournful with a vague unrest, as though encom- passed by some hidden ill. Though gifted with a strong mind, she was not free from superstition; sometimes it took the form of poetry and hallowed the every-day common- places of life with a rich glow of romance, lending beautyv to the place upon which it fell, but as often it bore hieavily upon trifles and magnified them into gigantic meaning. It would have been an easy thing to conquer this disease of the imagination, as some have designated it, but Helen did not think it injurious; and had she given it up, while dis- carding what was repulsive in its features, she would have been obliged to relinquish its beautids and pleasures. Thus, while beholding the same moon shining above her, with the same almost human expression upon its disc, as though it were overlooking earthly affairs, and reading especially the secrets of her heart, she was carried back in memory to that solemn night of death and self-dedication to a life- purpose, to finding her father other than she had deemed     164      EILEN CO URTENA EY him, and to the fact that she was left alone. Connecting that night with this, she waited with beating heart for some development of evil, some new trouble in her path, while tears gathered to her eyes and mournful thoughts thrilled her like an unseen touch upon discordant harp strings. She felt, though she did not see, her companion's searching look while leaning against the casement, and that long, earnest gaze of his helped to oppress her still more. Grow- ing impatient under it, and feeling nervously vexed at being the object of his scrutiny, she broke the painful spell of silence in a voice which was quick, impatient, and impera- tive in its tone, though not loud enough to have reached the ears of Julia Dearing. "What have I done," she asked, flashing upon him sud- denly the almost angry glance of her eyes, " that you haunt me for ever like a ghost of evil with a look as though some terrible doom hung over my life? Night and day, asleep or awake, for ever and for ever, it is the same still; I see nothing, nothing but the sad vision of your sorrowful face." "I love you, I love you," he answered. " O God, I love you, and you love me not. I would die for you, Helen. I would suffer torture that you might know happiness; I would endure fierce bodily and mental suffering to know that you were free from pain. Ah, would to heaven that I could exchange places with that shadowy form yonder, upon whom God's benediction of 'rest' must soon fall; or better," he continued, with increasing excitement, " that you and I, you and I," he dwelt lingeringly upon the coupled words, "were lying dead, coffined together, heart to heart, in one sheltering grave." He had evidently forgotten himself, and a whispered "hush" from Helen recalled him from his frenzied mood. Like one aroused from insensibility, he passed his hand over his brow and begged her humbly to forgive him. "Love," he -said softly, " has made me mad, and the same potent cause can make me sane again. See, I am calm once more." They both were silent then, lost in deep musings; he thinking, as he ever thought, of her; she thinking, as she had never thought before, of him. O   HELEN COURITEA Y.        165 Love, she had heard of it, read, of it, but could not conceive of it as stronger than his. Was it not, she asked herself, with the weird moon flooding her with its mystic light, a gift which it were wrong for her to cast away? Would not God hold her responsible for that man's soul, white now, but if neglected by her perhaps blackened with sin? Was it not clearly her duty as his wife to accept his generous devotion, his help in her life dedication, to tell him all; to share her heavy secret with him--to rest; for, doubtless, in time she would find rest on his faithful heart, to try to love him? Yes; it was clearly her duty. She raised her eyes skyward; if a look could have given coun- sel it was expressed in the round intelligent face of the watching orb, that said plainly in echo to her own conclu- sions, "Yes; it is thy duty." He, the object of her thoughts, had seated himself near her, his bowed head leaning on his hand, his face hidden. She knew that she was urged on by something clearly not her own will, but no more could she have resisted it than the flow of the ocean tide. A moment more and she.'was standing by his side, and drawing his hand away from his eyes, that he might realize what she knew he could scarcely believe, said calmly, almost mechanically: "See, I have come to you; take me with all my faults; do not separate me from yourself any more in thought, life, or destiny.  Then in a more hurried tone she added: "Say some word to me now, at once, quickly, that will bind me to you for ever." He stared wildly upon her like - one suddenly awakened from sleep, then said with a beating heart: "Is this real? Do you love me? Can you love me? Will you be my wife?- I am bewildered, Helen, darling; forgive me if I have said aught to offend you, only tell me if it be true or merely the mockery of a dream?" "Do not ask me to love you yet," she answered, slowly and deliberately; " wait for that hour to come; but if your solitary heart and home need me; if I can make you hap- py; 'if your life is incomplete without me, then take me; I am yours." He looked at her fixedly for a moment as with his hands clasped by hers, her head bent towards him, her breath    166       HELEN COURTENA Y upon his face, she consecrated herself to his service, promis- ing to be his wife--the realization of the brightest destiny that ever fell to the lot of man. Better than ever he loved her then; not perchance as passionately as he sometimes did, but with a holy, chastened affection, such as men feel for those dear to them who have been rescued from some great peril, and with a rapturous delight, a sense of security which could be interpreted to mean, "mine, mine spite of fate." The strong impulse of his heart was, now that she was all his own, to seal the compact with a first kiss, which from its intensity she would remember through a lifetime, and with his encircling arm to draw her in a close embrace, an earnest that so he would shield her through all coming time, while his lips murmured inaudible words of tender- ness, drawn from a well of affection deeper than is often known by mortal man. "Merciful heaven, how he loved her, not only because he desired to be her support, her stay, her guide, but with the selfishness of an all-absorbing passion he longed, with inexpressible yearning, to rest his world-weary head upon her breast, and to enshrine her within his home. It was a sweet thought, a pearl imbedded amid unsightly rocks; he stooped as though to gather it, then closed his eyes, and resolutely went upon his way. "Do what is best for her," said the clarion voice of his conscience; "remember how plainly she made it known that she could never return your love; there may be some- thing better in store for her than a life spent with you; take not advantage of a sudden impulse; put her away from you gently but firmly, yet I counsel you to put her away." So reasoning, a sudden faintness overtook him; for an instant he was dead to memory and hope, but by a strong effort of will recovered himself, and spoke calmly to her once more. "Heaven bless you, Helen, my best beloved, my own now and for ever. You have done what you thought to be your duty, well. God grant that I may do mine as unflinch- ingly. You must let the words which pity has led you to utter, be for ever blotted from your memory, or if you must   HELEN COUR0TENAY.       167 remember them, think of them as uttered in a dream. I shall not take advantage of the frame of mind in which you found yoursel for I love you too well to wrong you- better, far better than life, since, thirsting unto death, I have put the offered draught from my lips untasted. Leave me as you purpose, in your youth and beauty; seek for the love which is' our ideal; live to be happy, to enjoy: but if you find t not, or if found it should disappoint you; if there should ever be a time when the way is weary; should you be lonely, desolate-dearest, come to me even then, and if not death's, you will find me unchanged and unchanging, yours." One more look he gave her, that old wistful look of affection, one more word of tender endearment, and with- out awaiting her answer, reluctant to trust himself for an instant longer, lest he might exact from her that from which he had just released her, he drew her towards the couch where her friend lay, and bidding her call Mrs. Dearing, whispered a few sad words that turned her thoughts from herself and him, and told her all. And so, digging a grave, he buried therein his heart and earthly hopes. Men may shout in triumph over a heroic death, wreath- ing the tomb of the departed one with laurels, and hymn- ing paeans in his honor; but angels raise a mightier song in praise of one struggling, self-denying life, and chronicle its history in heaven.  Julia Dearing awoke from her trance-like slumber with the consciousness that the change for which she had so long looked had at last arrived. It was not made known to her by any word from others, but she felt it in the fresh agony she experienced, and an internal conviction that it was to be her last. If there had been any doubt on hei part, those sorrowful faces bent over her, and that groan of anguish from a parent about to be bereft of her only child, would have told her the-truth. Still through it all she was the comforter, the soother, saying, "Blessed are ye that mourn;" and in the solemn stillness her voice fell upon the listeners' ears like dew upon the parched earth, a mar- tyr's strength of endurance animating her to the end.     168       HELEN COURTEMA Y. "Let me not sleep, Helen," she said, as her friend feared to move, lest some nerve of the sufferer should feel the very air jarring upon her sensitive frame; "I would die awake, fully sensible of my great privilege. You would not enter, after a long wearisome pilgrimage, into a beau- tiful country with closed eyes; neither would I lose my consciousness so near my journey's end. Speak to me; let not this lethargy overcome me; speak to me, dear Helen, even if it be the beginning of a long farewell." But Helen spoke not, she could not; her fast-flowing tears stopped her utterance. Then the dying girl's voice, clear, and as if tuned to music, rebuked them gently as they stood weeping around her. "Why mourn?" she said reproachfully; " will you not trust me to One who has said 'I go to prepare a place for you?' Think of the ten- der meaning of the words, and who uttered them, who is making ready a home such as my soul needs. Think of it, Helen; ponder over it; take it to yourself. A kind friend, seeing you in trouble, prepared a place for you, a home, a rest. In your distress, and trusting him blindly, you came to it, and found what you desired, quiet and sympathy. If your heart be not cold and dead, you must love the friend who did all that he knew how to matke your happi- ness." Losing sight of Julia's deeper meaning, Helen thought only of herself, and uplifting her face with a look of appeal to Dr. Percival, he heard, through her sobs, words meant only for him. "Yes, I love him, I think I love him," she said; but he, without looking towards her, answered her only with a mournful but decisive negative motion of his head, and two words that Helen remembered long, not believing them in the excitement of the moment, but ever afterwards realizing that he knew her better than she knew herself. "Self-deceived," he said; "self-deceived." "Then," continued Julia, pursuing her own train of thought, and unconscious that-any other interpretation had been put upon it, " how ungrateful should I be not to rely entirely upon the Master's words and his heavenly prepa- ration." Then came those last precious moments of consciousness   TELEN CO URTENA Y        169 and life, and while they passed quickly away she bade fare- well separately to all standing around her. First fromn her mother she asked forgiveness for all her fancied sins of child- hood and of maturer years, calmly telling her not to weep, for the lengthened shadows of her life pointed heavenward where she would meet her soon. Then to Dr. Percival, the untiring friend, the noble benefactor, she spoke words com- pensating him for all his care; and putting out her hand as was her custom in their daily parting, she told him " good- by" without the usual addition, "come again to-morrow." But from Helen she seemed loath to part; a mysterious bond, all unseen by mortal eyes, had linked them together, and drawing her to her side she pressed her bloodless lips in lingering fondness upon. her face, then held her hands fast clasped in hers and thanked her for so sweetly smooth- ing her parting hours. Next she prayed that God would lead her to the truth; and while so praying, and as the morning sun told that the darkness of the night was past, her pure spirit took its flight from earth to its heavenly home. Then to Helen followed in quick, dreamlike succession the stunning thought that her friend was no more; the blessed thought that she had left her benediction even upon her, and her own conviction that in its highest sense that short but happy communion would aid her to live a better life. Immediately succeeding this event Helen received a summons from Mr. Drayton, who sent his carriage to convey her to the country-seat where he dwelt, and leaving Mary with Mrs. Dearing, she took her departure. Dr. Percival cared for her with -brotherly kindness to the last, calmly bidding her God-speed, while she, losing all self-command, wept passionately at the thought of her untried future and the secure have;i from which she was going. "God for ever bless you; farewell," was all that he said as she sobbed out her parting words. To him, so seemingly serene, it was a death-knell of happiness; to her, over whose cheeks flowed plenteous tears, it was as thistle-down wafted away by the wind and forgotten. True is it that the stormiest grief is soonest ended, or, as the poet hath said: "Feeling is deep and still." 8  170       HELEN CO URTENA Y. CHAPTER XIV. GREENWOOD Seat, Helen's destination, was pleasant to be- hold under every variation of sky, dark or bright, shadowy or sunny; and although she had passed through much checkered scenery, lovely, striking, and picturesque, when the huge symmetrical pile appeared in the distance in all its grandeur, with its embrasures, turrets, and imposing towers, a glad sense of joy thrilled her at the reflection that at least for a season she might call that beautiful home her own. When looking upon it, romance and reality were so blended in her mind that it was hard for the gentle wan- derer to separate them. It seemed not more visionary to her to deem herself the daughter of a long line of nobles than a lonely exile from her own country, flying from an almost princely fortune, and seeking as a governess a sup- port for herself and another whom she had not seen. She had but to draw vividly upon her imagination to change her identity entirely, as the castle towered up in bolder relief against the clouds-and why blame her for the bril- liant ideal, when the real was quite as marvellous and pecu- liar? She took upon herself in her reverie a titled name; old Norman blood flowed in her veins; her ancestors had fought valiantly by the side of the conquering William, re- tiring within those very walls, so impregnable against Saxon prowess, to enjoy their well earned repose. Following this train of thought, she pictured their boasted security until the fierce wars of the contending Roses laid them almost in ruins, to rise again in more peaceful times to beauty and preeminence in the land. It was her forefathers, so said the spirit of her dream, who remodelled the building after the Restoration, embellishing its walls, adorning its grounds, and erecting its outworks of defence and castellated towers. Along those terraced walks her grandams had roamed, or amid the yew and fir plantations had inhaled the vigor- ous air or ridden over the wavy downs. Then who but they had been the almoners in the beautiful village smiling in the distance, or in the pomp and pride of noble descent   :.-:          H'ELE N COURTENAY.        71 had attended the rustic church whose spire rose against the western sky. The bright side of the picture was the only one to which the fancy of our heroine turned. She gave not-a thought to the inner life of those who had inhabited the castle-home; to the present aristocratic -and proud but impoverished owners who, though boasting the blood of princes, and averse to parting with a single heirloom or relic of gran- deur, were content to leave their property for a few years, that they might revel for a while in the freedom and luxury of continental travel. Nor did Helen think of the strangers who had taken their place, or that she was to be a paid dependant, sub- ject to the whims and caprices of those who had engaged her services as their governess, but with the most catholic and comprehensive spirit appropriated to herself the lordly edifice as she did the blue sky, the verdant park, the aged trees, and the graceful deer bounding unchecked through the extensive woods. But the consciousness that the coach was motionless and her journey over, banished her visionary mood and made her realize that she was now being conducted by a servant in livery through a long spacious court into a passage leading to a dining-hall of magnificent dimensions, a relic of those bygone ages when, instead of its now vacant recesses and frescoed ceilings, it was filled with guests and retainers, and hung with armor interlaced upon its walls. .. Her attendant here disappearing, his place was supplied by others, who offered her refreshments and signified that she would be conducted at her pleasure to her own apart- ment, adding also that Mr. Drayton desired, after she had rested herself, to have an interview with her in the library. Although no master'of the house appeared to welcome her, still the thought that she was expected and cared for was a source of inexpressible comfort to Helen in the midst of scenes so new and strange. Fdllowing her guide across the entrance hall, and ascending a stone staircase lighted by windows of painted glass, she found herself at last in a room the counterpart of which she had known only in books. Was she acting a part with all the illusions of the dj ':,'-     172       HELEN COURTENA Y, stage about her? she asked herself, gazing around with a dreamlike feeling. Was that quaint, canopied bed really the one upon which she was to sleep  That heavy pol- ished furniture, that curious stucco-work, to be temporarily her own? Were those pictures, undoubted originals, so perfect in design and execution, hers to feast her eyes upon when she chose? Truly Mr. Drayton, thanks to Dr. Per- cival, had been thoughtful of the comfort of his governess, treating her rather as a noble guest than as a subordinate. It was an English twilight still, and as Helen dismissed the attentive soubrette who offered to serve her and drew aside the rich damask window-hangings, a joyous exclama- tion of pleased surprise escaped her lips at the exquisite scene meeting her view: the fading light of the evening glancing upon the tree-tops, the long vista of the deer- park, the undulating hillocks and dales, with clumps of ancient forest-trees dotting the landscape; beyond, the orchard demesne; further off still, a view of waters like a silver thread, with the yet more distant prospect of pictu- resque appendages, downs and shady copses, mountains and changing skies. It was with difficulty that she prevailed upon herself to leave the enchanting picture, but the lengthening shadows and the thought of the interview in the library warned her that time was passing; then with emotions something like those she had fancied experienced by the prince in the fairy tale who was mysteriously and by unseen hands con- ducted hither and thither, robed and disrobed in the en- chanted palace, she proceeded to make her toilet. It was tasteful, because she ever felt in her inmost heart that order, fitness, elegance, were laws of nature and the inani- mate from which mortals were not exempt, and the colors she chose were harmonious both in contrast and unison, and became as much a part of her as the gloss of her raven hair. After these little arrangements were made she stood still for a moment, smiling at a conceit that came to her mind, as the mirror reflected her face and form.!"I am ready for the call-boy when my turn comes in the play," she said, echoing aloud the thought. Then a look of sadness   A',:,       jEHrELEY COURTENAY.       173 took the place of the smile, for from the stage-boards her thoughts wandered to Dr. Percival, then to her departed friend, and clasping her hands, Helen prayed as she had taught her, for strength and guidance, recognising God's mercy that had followed her through all her wanderings, from childhood, in her little woodland harbor, whose dome was the sky, to that very moment while standing beneath the frescoed walls of a stranger's home. As her attendant had pointed out the library to her on the way to her own apartment, Helen found no difficulty in retracing the steps leading to it. Her eye, as she entered the room, took in at a glance the strange though not inap- propriate mingling of times departed and modern luxuries, -old barbarous grandeur and later inventions of comfort. The spaces unoccupied by bookcases were exquisitely painted with designs from the antique, while the books were the rarest and choicest of every language. This was what attracted Helen of the inanimate; for the rest, a white-haired man, large, portly, and dignified, arose to meet her. That because he had a right to them he enjoyed, the good things of life was plain; that he appreciated the power of gold was plain also, because it surrounded him with luxuries to which none but the very wealthy have access. Nor was there any ostentation in his manner; on the contrary, this conscious independence of the world was toned down to refinement, and he simply appeared to be what in reality he was, a rich man, book learned, a linguist, travelling- for enjoyment, and appropriating in his own peculiar fashion many things that others did not or could not estimate as he did. Add to this a vein of eccentricity which belonged to his family from past generations, a soft- ening as it were of a far-off case of insanity, a flaw in the blood of his otherwise pure-blooded ancestors, and this description is all that he needs. "You are welcome, Miss Tracy," he said, blandly; "will-you give me your company before we adjourn to the sitting-room for coffee, and allow me to become acquainted with my friend. Percival's friend? Were you quite con- tent to come? Did he, tell you that this is not London, and that we are very retired here ."  174       HELEN CO URTENA Y "I am very glad of the retirement," she answered; " that is what I need, and I shall be most grateful for it." "Ah yes, I remember; Percival gave me some such idea in what he wrote. My friend, Miss Tracy, is a natural nobleman, royal without an outward badge to designate him; most lordly, though no star shines upon his breast. His letter at once insures to you from my hands con- sideration and kindness." "I thank you, I thank him," she said warmly. "I meant to convey to you," he continued, " that he is made in a finer mould than every-day men; in a picture, he would be the prominent object, they the subordinate acces- sories. I count him, proud of the honor, myfriend, for he has shown himself to be such; and moreover, in a desperate case of illness, I believe from my soul that his skill saved my life: and yet you, you rejected a heart as pure as a pure woman's, and a hand as stainless as his heart." Helen half rose from her seat, blushed scarlet, and then said with dignity : "I pray you, sir, spare me your regrets. If Dr. Percival has seen fit to give you his confidence in the most sacred relations of life, excuse me from the recapitula- tion of his experiences, and let the matter rest for ever." "Presently, presently," returned Mr. Drayton in a dogged, persevering manner; "we shall understand each other soon. It seems to me more than strange that you, that any woman, should cast away so fair and happy a lot. What are you, what is your appearance, blonde or brunette, of angel or earth-beauty, grand or petite, strong-minded or timid, that you feel yourself so far above God's best creation as to turn away from him with indifference?" He, this strange compound of candor and kindness, had been walking to and fro across the room, his hands clasped behind him, his eyes bent on the floor, when suddenly ap- proaching Helen, he regarded her with scrutinizing gaze. It was impossible to sit calmly under this searching investi- gation ; and our heroine, so callous before a great audience, found herself trembling in every limb, and rising, she stood before him like a lily before a stormy blast, awaiting the result. Then he looked long and fixedly at her glossy hair, its simple, classic arrangement, her low, Dian-like brow, her   HELEN CO URTENA .        15Y clear brunette coloring, her interlaced, trembling fingers, and her reed-like symmetrical figure. Had he laid his great hand in wrath upon her shoulder he might have shaken her as the wind shakes a slender plant, or have crushed her in his giant grasp. What was she, he thought, that she dared refuse to be guided by a soul so far above her, an arm so fit to sustain her as that of his pure and noble friend, whose suit she had spurned? What? He did not say it, but intuitively she felt that his reflections were not all to her advantage; she grew tired of his scru- tiny; her old sense of power asserted its claims, and shaking off her temporary cowardice, with something of a defiant air she stood erect before him. "Let this end," she said calmly, looking straight into his eyes, and in a tone that could not be misunderstood; "be kind enough to turn to another subject, namely, what you require of me as the governess of your children." His book knowledge availed him nothing then; he was only conscious of reading a living volume, and of looking down into the deeps of Helen's strong nature, feeling not rebuked, for he was aware of no breach of etiquette on his part, but satisfied that he should never again ask her the why and wherefore of her actions, or doubt her motives more. This was his conclusion then; little did he think that the time would come when his views would be altered, or that any combination of circumstances would lead him to distrust her who was in a measure under his protecting care. He had intended to ask her about her career as an actress; now he felt it to be a sealed book; in a single instant she had defined his position and hers, and in accordance with her desire he turned the conversation upon his children. Helen, relieved from the extraordinary examination of the minute before, reseated herself, awaiting what would follow next. Her host sat apart from her, and in the gloom of evening his voice had a mournful sound, impressing her more sensibly than it would have done had the sunlight shone upon him as he spoke. "Early after my marriage," he said, "I lost my wife, who lert me with two little girls. I turned the dark page     176       HELENY C OURTENA Y. in my life with new and strict notions of duty. I thought to educate these children myself, to make them my com- panions; to teach them what I knew of classic lore. It is astonishing to see what, with careful training, can be done for the minds of the young.' Science became a plaything with them; the dead languages like their mother tongue; but, alas! while storing their heads I forgot their hearts; and when it was too late, discovered my mistake. That I had made a mistake I did not realize until age had some- what taken from me my energy, usefulness, and strong native will; when my step was not as firm as in youth, my eyes dim, and my hands trembling. Then I looked around for something upon which to lean, and found nothing; nothing but pride of intellect, selfishness, and indifference to the old man who, once green and hale, now lies across their path a dead, useless tree. If I had a trumpet-tongue, Miss Tracy, so that the fathers and mothers of the land might hear me, I would say: Parents, educate your chil- dren for your old age, not for your prime; teach them pity, forbearance, love, long before and long after aught else, that perchance the seed you sow may bear the golden fruit you need. Too late-too late I have attempted to scatter grain so precious; for the ground is rocky and will not receive it. Thus you can imagine why, failing myself, I have ventured to try the experiment of having one of their own sex to bring them back to childhood once more; an arduous experiment, I forewarn you, for her who would undertake it; but even should she fail, she will have earned my entire respect; should she achieve the work of reform, no gratitude or gold would be too great in my estimation for her reward. In view of this, you see I required no ordinary woman to perform the task; and though I stated some of the requirements I desired to my friend Percival, I withheld many more vital ones. He, perhaps, looking only on the bright side of the picture, thought you all-suffi- cielt for the situation. Do you think that you can fill it? Will you try? As regards the footing you will occupy in my family, I will tell you, beforehand, that save in your province of teacher and your stated income, you are to be one of us. The last-mentioned item you will yourself de-   HELEN COURTENA Y.        17 cide upon; naming for your services and devotion to your work what would be a more than abundant compensation; you must allow me to use my own discretion and pleasure in adding to this sum. Finally, I trust that you will instruct your pupils in all those gentler accomplishments that I have so neglected; music, poetry, the modern languages, light literature, and all the graces that ornament a home. Perhaps you may wonder," he continued, after a brief pause, '6 why, feeling the need of a more refining influence in my house- hold, I have never married a second time; for there are many who, spite of my frosted hair, would sacrifice themselves for a lot so brilliant as I could offer them, making at the same time conscientious and agreeable companions; but to be brief- "Iiving, I loved my wife; dead, I love her still, and shall for ever love her." He spoke as if to put the last subject at rest, and as though to quiet speculation; placing, as it were, a seal upon a closed missive. "I have but little more to say," he continued; " your work is before you; perhaps you may find it a pastime; God grant that it be so; I may have exaggerated my troubles; I may have misjudged them, my children; would to heaven that it may prove so; but my daughters are- strange, Miss Tracy; my daughters are strange." Helen and Mr. Drayton sat awhile silent, he with his head bent upon his hands, occasionally sighing deeply, and she wondering, with not the bravest heart in the world, at the new position into which her destiny had led her. At length he roused himself from his reverie, and leading the way, conducted Helen to his daughters' presence in the saloon, where the family gathered nightly for reading, games, or conversation, as best suited their several inclinations. Leaving the basement floor, they ascended the imposing stairway; and though Helen would fain have linfgered to admire the perfect proportions of the vestibule with its unique columns, Mr. Drayton, not divining her unspoken wishes, ushered her at once into the family circle. With a quick-sightedness fostered by her stage educa- tion, Helen soon discovered how strikingly in taste and keeping were the appointments of the apartment, how 8*     178       HELEN CO URTENAY. well suited it was for cheerful evenings, how suggestive of all that was beautiful in art, how luxurious the arrangement of its minutest details-the silken hangings, the massive oak furniture, the pictures adorning the walls, a Guido, a Claude, a Murillo, giving brightness to the room, as sun- shine brightens a landscape. The inmates of the apartment were Mr. Drayton's daugh- ters, Cornelia and May, his brother and his brother's son, all of whom recognised the new-comer with a greeting cor- dial or indifferent as they felt an interest in her, or could afford to be interrupted in the various occupations engaging their attention. The ceremony of an introduction being over, ifso in- formal a thing could have been called by that name, Helen took a seat somewhat apart from the rest, trusting to time and observation to discover just what they expected her position to be, and the level that each, individually, thought her entitled to occupy. They were a silent group; but the silence did not seem unnatural, since there was no appearance of any unusual weight upon their spirits, nor did any one make an exer- tion to be entertaining. Mr. Drayton sometimes read, but oftener sat deep in thought, perchance with his life of the past, or with the great authors who, dying, had left him enriched with their works; his two daughters, rapt, scarcely breathing, were intent over a game of chess; his brother, somewhat older than himself, still hale in body but failing in mind, seemed struggling in vain to keep awake, but was from the infirmities of age physically unable to do so; while the son of the latter was bending with knitted brows over a volume whose language seemed to baffle his patient and earnest endeavors to conquer its mysteries. All these Helen knew were to be her companions in the present act of her life-drama, and when wearied of contem- plating them, she had but to glance opposite where she sat to find interest of a different character-still life, too, but strikingly suggestive-in an exquisite design of a Hebe and a Ganymede, as perfect as sculpture could make them, and represented as drawing aside white marble curtains from the aperture admitting the fireplace, and filling the   HELEN COURTENA Y.        179 room with an all-pervading presence of beauty. Helen, left to herself, found for a time in the paintings and these marbles entertainment for her eyes and thoughts-the lat- ter wandering to other hearth-stones, imaginary and real, in palace or hovel, and she felt how truly the fireside was a magnet drawing absentees home; how a father, weary with brain or hand labor, looked forward to the evening hour spent in the magic atmosphere surrounding it; how a brother, with other attractions awaiting him abroad, still lingered around its genial warmth, the meek mother smil- ing with pride at the complete circle, the daughters with their busy needles, the schoolboy with his morrow's task, the little children gazing solemnly into the ascending flame. This domestic dream, however, was not calculated to soothe our heroine, being totally excluded from any resembling it, while deep within her soul was the dreary consciousness of being a stranger in a strange land, shut out from those other beating hearts around her, apart from their world, with many a rampart to scale, many a defence to demolish, before she could venture within their guarded citadel. No one looked towards her, no one addressed her; she grew weary even of the paintings and statuary; thinking of her- self provoked her, since it had become monotonous and wearisome, and the conclusion followed that she had never been so entirely alone. Looking out of herself for enter- tainment her eyes wandered to the game of chess, in which she soon became deeply interested, the position of the board being favorable for an observation of the pieces and the antagonists. The younger sister, May, who was playing her game with a reckless daring that sometimes achieves more than systematic study, had a good-natured expression, though a cunning light shone from her bright blue eyes whenever an opportunity occurred of surprising or overreaching her sister. She was below the medium height, round and fair, and had it not been for the unfeminine and independent training that had developed the intellectual above the pure womanly qualities, giving her face hard lines of premature maturity, her countenance would have pleased with" its sweetness as would a waxen doll's made human; but there     180       HELEN   C0 URTENA . was so great a mixture of strength and weakness that the union was far less agreeable than either separately would have been with just her set of features. Now and then, indeed, Helen judged her to be what the world in common parlance calls " very pretty," if rosy lips, pearly teeth, and pink and white complexion commingled are a standard; and she hoped some day in the future, when better acquainted with her, to find her new pupil more attractive. The other, Cornelia, had an air of serious interest, far too serious for pastime. Her dark, heavy brows almost met in her intensity of thought; her slender, well shaped hand was constantly pressed to her forehead as though to concentrate the power of her will, or hovered with nervous, fluttering fingers over the board like a bird of prey over a miniature battle-field, while her eyes glared with almost lurid light upon her opponent. Her features, in Helen's judgment, were elegant-she could find no other'word that so defined their peculiar style-a straight, Grecian nose, with finely cut nostrils; thin, firm lips; pale, oval cheeks; a low, broad brow, like the antique models of a Juno. Nor did the rest of her person fail to interest Helen; her long yet not ungraceful arms, her very tall stature, her short black hair waving rather than curling around her face, her striking figure about which her apparel hung like the drapery of a statue, her quick restless glances, never meeting fully the eyes of others, but always furtively peering around, as though afraid of being detected in the act of looking at another. Thus, though the elder sister attracted as a study, no one would have called her beautiful; though possessing every requisite for beauty; she inspired fear, rather-repugnance; and Helen wished the hour might never arrive when those long tapering fingers would clasp hers, even in a pressure of love. The young governess discovered further, that when Cor- nelia's fire-lit eyes could be spared from the development of the game of chess, they ever wandered with the same furtive glance towards the student, bending oblivious to aught else over his volume, although she was satisfied that he was unconscious of Cornelia's scrutiny, for her glance was too quick and guarded for him to be aware of her espionage.   HELEN C O URTENAY.        181 If Helen had previously entertained the idea that her future pupils were little children, she was now -completely undeceived. The elder was at least two years her senior- May her own age; their opinions formed, their minds well stored with far more book knowledge than she could boast, though of a different nature. While they had been walking among the graves of the past, unburying the dead, and familiar with their fossil bones, her steps had only led hUr among modern gardens, plucking therefrom- garlands of beautiful thought, and treasuring them up as delightful memories; and though she scarcely knew the old Greek philosophers by name, with Cornelia and May they were household words. Then too while Helen could only quote the songs of the poets whose lives were still fresh in the memory of men, her future pupils revelled in the epics of the ancients, or hung entranced over the elaborate paeans of the poet-musician of Thebes. But to return individually to our heroine; her thoughts and speculations were put to flight by an occurrence reveal- ing to her far better than the study of countenances the want of domestic harmony in that household; it was the sad note of discord in their lives, enlisting all of Helen's sympathies ill Mr. Drayton's behalf. A sound between a cry for help and a groan attracted her attention, and upon looking towards the place whence it had proceeded, she discovered that her host was leaning back in his chair with closed eyes and ashen face, his whole attitude being one of helplessness. Whether fainting or in a fit, Helen could not determine; but her impulse was to spring forward and support his drooping head upon her arm. Almost at the same instant as herself, the student arose quickly and rushed to the assistance of Mr. Drayton.           I "Is he often thus!" whispered Helen as they stood to- gether watching the death-like countenance. "Is there danger in his state?. Does he suffer?" "Yes," returned the other, answering her questions in the order in which they were asked; "I am sorry to say that he is subject to these ill turns; sometimes they are very severe, sometimes slight. There is no present danger e1     1 82       HELEN C O URTENA Y. attending them, however, nor does he appear to suffer much physical pain." In the meantime the game of chess continued; but few words were said by the players concerning their father's condition, only an interchange of sentences, when Helen sprang to his assistance, in a language she did not under- stand-a low mocking laugh, a shrugging of shoulders, and then a deeper interest in the warfare; while his brother roused himself with effort from his comatose state, glanced around sleepily, saw that Herbert was near Mr. Drayton, said softly in a voice of pity, "Poor Arthur," and then closed his eves in slumber once more. The fainting-fit, or whatever it might have been, was not of long continuance-Mr. Drayton slowly recovering his consciousness. A sweet smile played about his lips as he pillowed his head more securely upon its gentle resting- place, while some reminiscence of his old life seemed to be awakened in his breast, for he spoke, and Helen caught the meaning of his words. "Thank you, dear Louise," he said; "how good, how kind you are; how precious are your love and care,- sweet wife!" Helen raised her eyes inquiringly to his who ministered with her at the lonely man's side. "It is always thus," he answered to her questioning glance; "memory goes back with him at these times to other, happier hours; he will entirely recover himself soon; let me relieve you now." w She returned to her seat busy with thought bearing upon the strange circumstances around her; the father's preca- rious state and need of close attention; the apathy of his daughters; the unavailing pity of his aged brother; and lastly, an inexplicable feeling, a memory mysterious yet fascinating, vague yet distinct, like a dream within a dream, and yet tangible and real as though that very scene, -or something like it, had been enacted before in her life. But when and where? In another existence or in this . In a trance or in her wide-awake hours t Beneath the solemn starlight or under laughing and sunny skies I Most prominent in her memory-   HELEN C O URTENA Y.       183 picture stood Herbert Drayton, with his tall, commanding figure and his deep-toned voice, uttering words of sympa- thy. But her impressions were not a certainty any more than a child's conceit of the murmuring sea through a shell is the sea itself, or a ray from -a distant star is the star it- self; yet she found herself gazing upon his face and form as with anxious solicitude he bent inquiringly over Mr. Drayton, so that when he uplifted himself from his leaning posture, he met her searching yet not bold scrutiny. Before many minutes had elapsed, the same order of things as before was restored: the game progressed with unabated ardor; the old man slept with a peaceful smile upon his lips; Mr. Drayton, as if unconscious of any unu- sual occurrence, but with a deep sigh as though striving to rid himself of some heart-burden, took up the book he had been perusing; the student was again absorbed in the page which so baffled his best endeavors to understand it; and Helen gazed once more at the living forms around her-the sculptured beauty of the hearth images, the delicious color- ing of the pictures, while, like a single note amid a myriad of instruments, sounded in her brain that mystic question: When and where? The players drew nearer and yet nearer together; it was evidently a game of no common interest; the pieces had assumed unusual positions, while May, in a cool, taunt- ing manner, was smiling at her superior chance of suc- cess. "Take care, take care," she said at length, holding up her finger warningly beneath her sister's eyes, " you are in danger; you make your knight a recreant if he forsakes his queen." Her white teeth glistened between her parted lips, the light of triumph beamed from her eyes. "How dare you tell me to be careful," returned the other, darting a look at May, which, had it been a poniard, would have had the power to slay. "I have sworn to win this game, I swear it still, spite of your loving ' take-care '-your 1 affectionate admonitions. -As if I were in need of being tutored by one whom I have taught!" "You are a bold tactician, Cornelia," answered May, in nowise ruffled by the storm she had helped to raise, " and I     184       HELEN CO URTENAY. an unpractised tiro; still, Miss Drayton, Miss Cornelia Drayton, I bid you again take care." Then her antagonist saw her danger; it had escaped her notice before, and now it was almost too late to remedy the evil. To May and Helen, May's next move, notwith- standing the warning she had given, would have check- mated Cornelia, but the quick restless eyes of the latter gloated over the board until they fastened on a bishop, the piece with which she intended to manoeuvre. Had the chessmen been written words she could not have read them more easily than she now did the carved ivory. At first her face grew gloomily angry, the blue veins in her forehead swelled-and it was truly a bad face to look upon; then a fiendish joy seemed to possess her; her hand was warily, slowly extended, and by a wonderful counterplot the nearly vanquished became the nearly victorious. How systematic was her playing! How like slow poison was her revenge! The great clock ticked audibly; the heavy breathing of the sleeper made the stillness more profound; the rustle of a leaf turned by the reader was a formidable noise in that quiet hour while those fierce passions so surely did their work. "It is easy to see who will be victor now," said Helen to herself, as Cornelia in her turn laughed at her unlooked- for success. It was not a laugh like May's, but something different and hard to be described. It was not mirth, nor the careless outpouring of a happy heart, but a terribly hol-  low sound, as though it veiled a bitter, cruel meaning. The laugh, or something more annoying still in the diffi- cult passage before him, jarred upon the student's patience, and he half rose, then sat, looked with a troubled gaze around, closed the book, reopened it, and puzzled over its pages once more. "I wish I understood German," he said at length, in a quick, vexed tone; "I need it now far more than Greek, Latin, Spanish, or French, for here I am at a stand until I can unravel a sentence, a key to the whole chapter, that baffles, cheats, and taunts me, saying: 'Here you must stop; across this flood you cannot go-you cannot float across, nor swim, nor wade the stream, neither can you   HELEN COURTENAY.        185 turn it from its course; close your laboratory, bid adieu to science, stop investigating, stop thinking, for it is useless!' Yes, verily, I must learn German." He half smiled as he spoke, though his brow showed signs of real distress. Science was his life, his breath; young as he was, his name was already made famous by new chemical discoveries; and now to leave his work un- done, simply because a language was unknown to him that he might have acquired so easily in his collegiate days, was a stumbling-block he could not but regard with annoyance. "Yes, I will go or send for a master," he continued; "Iearn the language with the patience of a martyr, and not be thwarted thus I " So saying his eyes wandered again to the page, and referring to a dictionary he endeavored to bring new light from the chaos of words. "We cannot help you, Herbert," said May, looking up, after a masterly move; " we would, you know, if we could." "And the reason that we cannot," said Cornelia, with frowning brow, "is because of our false education; truly, our talents are like the languages we know-dead and buried!" Mr. Drayton glanced towards Helen without speaking, but his look was as prolific of meaning as many words. "You see," it said, "what my reward is for my pains and anxious care." "And besides," said Cornelia, her long, slender finger resting for an instant upon her queen, "perhaps even if we did know German, you would not let us help you; would you, Herbert?" For'one moment her eyes were quite steady, lifted to his face, and looking towards him with a ray which, to Helen, seemed strangely out of place in their glowing flame- something tenderer than tenderness-love! He either did not or would not hear her; but closing the book wearily, clasped his hands above his head student- fashion, and breathed a quick, short, impatient sigh. Whether Cornelia noticed that her question was unan- swered or took new interest in the game, Helen could not determine; but with an air of certain victory she moved a -pawn not previously of much use, and uttered an emphatic     186       HELEN COURTENA Y "check" Nothing could now apparently save May, who seemed doomed to defeat. But still as Cornelia had rescued herself from as perilous a position, there was at least a hope that by close attention she, too, might make a brilliant retaliation. Every motion of her eye was watched by the elder sister, who seemed endowed with power like a mesmerist to know her antagonist's mind. The silence was breathless; like two athletie at the games of the an- cients striving to reach a desired goal, every sinew was strained for victory. The one seemed to say, "You cannot outrun me;". the other, "I will!" And so the game progressed until the final move. Suddenly a form like a dark shadow flitted across the room to Herbert Drayton's side. "I understand German," he heard some one say; "I will help you." "You " The interrogative sign is after the word, but it was scarcely a question that he asked; it was something be- sides a simple query-wonder mixed with incredulity at the thought that she could make his mystery plain. "Yes, I." In reply to a gesture and look, for she said no more words, he resigned his seat to her, opened the book, point- ed to the offending passage, and awaited with folded arms the result. The clear, pure light of the waxen candles fell upon Helen's bent head and glossy hair, so rich in its simple yet classic arrangement; her down-dropped lids, with their long, jet lashes, curtained her eyes; she was quite motionless, and as though the sentient part of her being had left its habitation, while the body simply was waiting its return. It was not an easy passage; there were many scientific terms therein, being an explanation of what had preceded, so that it was not the work of a minute to make it plain, but of several minutes' undivided attention. As Helen sat there in Herbert Drayton's chair before his table, bend- ing over his book graceful beyond expression, her educa-   HELEN COURTENA .        187 tion for the stage leading her to be careful of her attitudes even in her most unguarded moments, the student's thoughts wandered for a while from his studies to her. She became to him a study-a mystery to unravel--so quiet, so self-possessed, so daring, yet so modest and fasci- nating; assuming to interpret what he could not, and si- lently asserting her power over his. Meanwhle at the chess- board, while May was pondering over a chance of escape, Cornelia for once forgot the game in watching with almost painful interest the presumptuous girl who had dared in- trude herself into Herbert Drayton's charmed circle; and him, so curiously regarding the stranger. She waited to see how entire the disgrace of the latter would be, she longed for the moment to come when, rising, Miss Tracy would say: "It is too deep for me, far beyond my ken;" then satisfied, she would have turned once more to the board to make her final conquering move; but no such words were heard, and May, glad of the delay and her sis- ter's brief inattention, planned and plotted with new life and zest. "It is clear now," said Helen, at length, "but was quite difficult to solve at first, because the subject and scientific terms were entirely new to me. Shall I read it to you, or pencil a free translation? The German is a language in which I shave been well drilled, and one wherein I feel entirely at home." "Read it," he said, with an incredulous smile; and as she complied with his request, the young man's face literally beamed with joy like a glad child's discovering the mecha- nism of a favorite toy; all his doubts were over, the hard problem solved. "Are there any other passages where my help will avail?" she asked; "if there are, -either now or at any other time, call upon me; I am so glad to be useful." "Thank you," he answered, with a serious look of grati- tude upon his face, " you tempt me to ask you to do a troublesome thing. I may request your daily aid; but I promise you to be a faithful scholar, docile and obedient." At that moment as they stood there together, for Helen had risen to return to her former seat, a sudden crash was     188       HELEN CO URTENAY. heard, and Cornelia appeared beside them. The victory    l she had sworn to achieve was forgotten; by an impulsive and reckless movement she had overturned the slight table upon which the board rested; and while May taunted her   ?  with making a new manoeuvre unheard of in the annals of   ( chess-playing--a plot to cover cowardice-unmindful of the  charge, she turned from her to Herbert and Helen. "Miss Tracy is our teacher, not yours, Herbert," she said in smothered tones of anger; "to teach you German was not in the compact; my father told me 'of no such  arrangement."'                      . Her breath came quickly; she tried to assume a bland and polite manner, but her words trembled as though the very depths of her being were stirred by some irrepressible  assionate emotion. A storm hung lowering over their  heads-lowering, but not breaking-for by a timely interpo- ! sition it ended only in low muttering thunder, and was kept perchance in reserve for other days. "Speak to her, speak to her, brother," said her uncle in the shrill piping voice of old age, and suddenly aroused  from his slumbers. "It is not quite clear, but somehow it seems to me that Cornelia is interfering with Herbert.  She must not interfere with him."  Mr. Drayton, thus appealed to, assumed a calm determi-  nation of manner evidently quite foreign to him, for it had  the effect, from its rarity, of quieting his daughter's stormy mood.  "Cornelia, you forget yourself," he said. "Miss Tracy is at liberty to do what she pleases in our household when  it does not clash with her duties to you and May, which  she clearly understands, having conversed with me upon  the subject. For my own part I shall only be too glad if she can be of use to Herbert. in his path to distinction; and  if his want of knowledge of German is his only clog, then for Heaven's sake let her take it speedily out of his way."  "Yes, yes," muttered the old man, still beclouded, and  having no positive idea of what was occurring except that his son was in some manner being wronged, "if Herbert wants help let him have it by all means, no matter what the cost may be." 3I   HELEN C 0URTENA Y.        189 [urning away somewhat abashed, but not humbled, Cor- ia stooped to assist May in gathering up the scattered ,ssmen at the other end of the room, while Mr. Drayton I his brother left the apartment together. Elelen, bewildered and weary, longed for retirement to ke off a sense of some personal trouble that assailed her ;he presence of the sisters. Moreover, she hoped by fur- r reasoning and self-commune to divest herself of the am-like feeling that had taken such deep hold of her alties in spite of all efforts of hers to resist it-a tanta- ng consciousness, beforementioned, of a repetition of a -one but forgotten hour. So complete was the delu- i, that it appeared to her as if she could foretell what uld next happen in that strange household. Bidding rbert good-night, she turned to say a parting word to- others. 'Stay a moment," he said, raising his hand to his brow an attitude of thought; "tell me, before you go, if we re ever met before, and if we have, under what circum-. ices. Your voice is familiar to me; the atmosphere rounding you, psychologically speaking, is not entirely V to me. Have we met before?" 'Then it must be the case," said Helen to herself. "If too, shares my impression, there certainly must be some ndation for our mutual train of ideas." With a power of will our heroine seldom summoned to aid, she called on memory to assist her; beginning Lost from her infancy to recall all the marked hours of life, until, like one self-mesmorized, she brought up tures of past events and held them before her view. t nowhere could she fix his presence, while standing s with his earnest eyes bent anxiously upon her to catch faintest shadow of an expression upon her countenance ing him that they had met before, As thus she stood was singularly attractive-arrested at his bidding, ded by a thought of him, him only, her face changing mentarily like an April sky as her recollections carried through scenes of merriment or sadness, her exquisitely delled figure, her position of perfect grace, her fingers sped loosely together, her uplifted eyes looking far away     190       HELEN COURTENA Y. from the present, almost speaking in the intensity of their expression, her whole air one of patient waiting the return of a wandering memory. "No, it cannot be," said her companion within himself; "after all, I must be mistaken; for to have seen her once, to have beheld those wondrous eyes, the rounded symme- try of her pliant form, had she but flitted like a bird across my path, would have been to me a day and hour never to be forgotten in the annals of my life." So reasoning, he advanced one step nearer where she stood to tell her how useless any further effort of memory would be, when her upraised hand warned him to be silent. "Hush," she said softly. "The mist is fading away; soon all will be clear. It is a recollection almost tangible, yet eluding me like a shadow. It does not belong to my country home, where as a little child I played in the wood- lands, nor yet is it coupled with music and a crowd, neither does it savor of mirth and revelry; far otherwise. It is linked to me with a chain of sorrow, of danger, of wailing winds, the wild fury of the elements, a struggling vessel; yes! a fearful ocean storm! Do you not remember?" He remembered all. "Good-night," she said. "Good-night," he answered dreamily, recalling in thought their brief heart-converse, her fearlessness, the darkness yet grandeur of those terrible hours; and leaving him as she had left him once before, Helen departed. --o-- CHAPTER XV. OUR heroine's sleep was dreamless. Being exhausted phy- sically and mentally, as her head rested upon her friendly pillow she fell into a deep slumber that continued until the morning was far advanced. Drawing aside the window curtains, she beheld the same scene that had met her admir-   "HELEN COURTENA .         191 ing eyes the evening before, save that its twilight beauty had brightened into sunshine--sunshine everywhere gilding tree-top and stream, church-spire and forest gloom. As the different members of the household met at break- fast, Helen thought that there was a marked contrast in r their demeanor to the night previous, perchance because all the elements around them were harmonious, or, more probably, because the bright and beautiful morning had breathed upon them a benediction of peace, calminag down their troubled spirits to quietude. Even Cornelia was like other mortals, and did the honors of the table with digni- fied urbanity, while May's face was as placid and passion- less as a summer lake. Nor did the good genius of the hour fail to visit the elder Mr. Drayton, for he ventured upon a few remarks, to which all listened, as an embodi- ment of good sense and benignity. Although Mr. Drayton had given Helen no suggestion as to the division of time for study and recreation, her own good sense naturally suggested that as soon as possible some order should be established in her province of instruc- tress; feeling the need of this, she gladly assented to a proposition from her host to accompany his daughters in a garden walk, that she might see the flowers in their fresh morning glory, trusting to the opportunity thus offered to arrange her plans with their help and concurrence. May sauntered by her side, Cornelia somewhat in the rear, the trio walking for awhile in silence. Simply to live and breathe under those superb skies was a delight to Helen, who dreaded to say one word that might interrupt the harmony of nature and the cadence in her own soul. Her whole being was filled as with a foun- tain of exquisite music, from which, had she been a great composer, she could have improvised melody worthy the hearing of angels. Perchance the sisters were -speechless too, because they felt something of the glad thrill of heart- joy animating her; but at length the charmed spell was broken by Cornelia's declaring her intention of returning to the castle, and of giving up the office of cicerone to her sister May. "Stay one moment, Miss Drayton," said Helen; "I     192       HELEN C O URTENA Y. have something to discuss with you-our future plans for study." There was something in Helen's tone that arrested Cor- nelia's intention of just then ending her walk-it was a command more than a request; she was a teacher enforcing a law, not a companion asking a favor; and though her future pupil's brow lowered, and her foot restlessly tapped the gravelled walk, while she hummed a tune, evidently desiring to show her disregard of Helen's authority, still, though with an ill grace, she remained. As she stood thus, sullen and forbidding, Helen, forget- ting the sweet Christian teachings of her friend, whose newly-made grave was not yet green, almost hated her, comparing her mentally to the Gorgon head, her short crisp hair to the snaky locks, her eyes to those terrible eyes that turned the rash gazer to stone. "I propose," said Helen, trembling, yet trying to be calm and brave, " after a short walk for health, to devote the early hours of the morning to study; later in the day I will give my attention to music, upon which your father lays so much stress as a desirable accomplishment; if you have the usual requisites, time, tune, and industry, iyou will soon make progress." Helen paused for a moment, expecting to be informed if they indeed possessed the vital foundation for a musical education, but their lips moved not in reply. Having tried the power of a dignified manner upon her future scholars, and failing signally, with politic aim she ventured upon a lively, and, for her, almost jocose strain. "In drawing," she said, "I fain would interest you, having always had a most fervent admiration for the hero- ines in novels ornamented with gipsy hats, who go into the woods armed with pencils and sketch books, translat- ing Nature with a fidelity surpassing herself to their port- folios." But, alas! Helen's new effort was not any more suc- cessful than the first; May only smiling at her pleasantry, while Cornelia's brow grew darker than before. Then, when she met with no word of encouragement from the former, no look of sympathy from the latter, but dogged   HELEN COURTENA . ,.        193 indifference rather, as though they were not in the compact at all, the hot blood mounted to the face of the young governess, and anger stirred her so lately tranquil-beating heart.         ,  "Your German lesson, I repeat," she said emphatically, "will commence in half an hour, at the expiration of which time I shall expect you in the apartment designated by your father as the study-room. As I do not profess to teach or achieve anything except with the entire obedience of my pupils, I insist upon that, as the beginning and end of success; then, setting aside all formality on my part, and commencing upon the footing on which we are to continue, I shall call you by your Christian names, Cornelia and May. Do we understand each other fully 2 Shall I expect you at the hour named?" "If May chooses to be bound by rules," said the elder sister, "(and she looks, standing quiescent there, as if she were really going to enter the bonds of slavery my father has so benignly forged for us; if she is willing to forego her morning ride, her freedom, for the petty tyranny of the schoolroom-thank Heaven, my will is yet my own. May, you surely will not submit to this p" Strange as it may appear, the strong tie binding Cornelia and her sister to each other was love, jealous, exacting love; they had slept together since childhood, formed leagues offensive and defensive with one heart; they had learned the same tasks, Cornelia assisting May, May lean- ing on Cornelia as a superior being who took, as far as she was able, the place of a mother. The link uniting them was not unlike that holding together the fiercest animals of the same species, at war often among themselves, yet when attacked by a ,common foe, dying, if it need be, in defending each other's lives. Sometimes a loving caress between the sisters would be followed by angry words of contention, often, for days, they refrained from addressing to each other a single word, but underneath their anger or their icy coldness, like the slumbering fires beneath a sleeping mountain, burneIca love, bright, fierce, unquench- able, in each estranged or seemingly indifferent heart. When Cornelia made her appeal to May, Helen was glad 9     194       HELEN  O URTENA Y. to turn from the stormy face of the former, her frowns and cutting words, to the placid countenance of her sister-too placid to show that she took much interest in the discus- sion, but still not repulsive in its calm, unmeaning expression. "We at least shall be friends," she said, before May had an opportunity of answering her sister. "I shall expect you surely, your father desires it, and, setting aside every other consideration, your first duty belongs to. him. Your sister, strong, youthful, blessed with health, will naturally remain by your side for years, but his every foot-fall is onward, graveward; he cannot in the course of nature have very long to live." "Ah!' The ejaculation was spoken in a tone that seemed to say that May was hearing something new; it was not contemp- tuous and discouraging to the speaker, but came from the home of newly-awakened thought. Helen, seeing the ad- vantage she had gained, continued: ( "Therefore, endeavor to strew flowers instead of thorns in his pathway. Will you come? And besides this I cannot express to you how much pleasure you will find in German if you study it faithfully, and what a glorious field of literature it will open to you. See with what a feverish thirst your cousin, who is only acquainted with the rudiments of the language, longs for a better knowledge of it. It is true that you cannot go along with him, because his other avocations will prevent his taking regular lessons, but by system and daily instruction you will overtake and then keep pace. with him; then think how delightful we can make our evenings (stormy evenings when the curtains are drawn and the gloomy night shut out) by gems of German song, or by reading, in their own language, extracts from Goethe or Schiller, or the secrets of the mys- tic Wieland's heart." "That certainly will be a pleasure," said May good- naturedly. "What Miss Tracy says is very charming, Cor- nelia; is it not? Then we have so few pleasures here, our lives are spent so stupidly compared with our busy travel- ling days; we have so little occupation that I, for one, am willing to enter the school-room again if she promises not to draw the bowstring too tight."   HELEN GOURTENA I         195 "I may expect you, then?" "Well-yes." "And you too, Cornelia?" asked Helen, turning towards her again. Her voice was tender and pleading enough to have melted a heart of stone; so winnling, so softly musical. Her anger hav- ing departed, she did what she had never done to mortal man or woman; the proud girl unbent to her haughty pupil, not indeed on account of any sudden feeling of affection for her, but for the sake of the neglected father's appeal, and some- thing yet higher and beyond thig, her own parent's memory and her death-bed vow. But she might have spared herself the unusual effort; Cornelia deigned to give her no answer, and after waiting a few seconds Helen retraced her steps, leaving the sisters to their own reflections,. Could we have followed her to the castle we should have seen that her steps were slow, her limbs weak, her eyes tearful, while in their depths we might have read that she was lonely, homesick, heartsick, doubtful of her 'own strength and powers of endurance for the task before her. Could we have invaded the sanctity of her own apartment, we should have seen a young girl nervously trembling, gazing for a moment with wistful look up into the blue heavens, then despairingly covering her face, bowing her head, and kneeling like one bereft of all earthly sympathy with an agonized cry for help in an hour of her extremest need;- only this. Could we have looked with curious gaze still deeper, whence came the cry for help, we should have seen cow- ardice at last taking possession of a brave soul, while the body to which it belonged, self-scourged, was taunting it for being so vacillating, so childishy weak, as to fear women's souls fashioned like itself, and their power to wound by hard words or blight by cold looks;- only this. We should have seen a fierce war between inclination and judgment-inclination to fly from the struggle that very instant to any refuge in the wide world ; judgment bidding her imperatively stay and fight inch by inch for victory over her shrinking self. We should have seen a strong spasm of the body which held that timid soul, a few big     196       tELEV  COURTENAY. tears easily counted as they dropped through her fingers; we should have heard a sigh deeper than common sighs, and have beheld her feet turned at length where her duty lay ;--only this. The end of the stated time found Helen in the study- room, and there to her great surprise the two sisters were awaiting her, eager to begin their promised lesson. Then it was that, witnessing the inconsistency of Cornelia, and re- membering the conduct of May and herself on the previous evening, she recalled their father's mournfully spoken words wrung from the depths of a suffering heart: "Miss Tracy, my daughters are strange." To minds so well drilled in the acquisition of languages of a far more difficult character, that in which Helen now undertook to instruct her pupils was almost like pastime, and she regarded with wonder and admiration the ease with which they memorized all that to her as a beginner had been hedged around with numerous difficulties. It was therefore no drudgery, but a continual pleasure to be able to guide learners so intelligent, who scarcely needed the usual routine of explanations, but intuitively applied the rules without aid from her. As their ambition was now excited, and but one leading thought in their minds-the acquisition of knowledge-their peculiar mannerisms, petty quarrels, indifference, and haughtiness, all vanished, and they were for the time, only what they appeared to be, rapt students, drinking from a delicious fountain, the key of which they held in their own hands. Nor did it escape Relen's notice that Cornelia more thanl once alluded to those pleasant evenings in the future, when Herbert, weaned from his solitary studies, would join them in their readings, X concluding, and rightly too, that no desire to please her had brought the elder sister so submissively to her teach- ings, but the thought of a nearer companionship with one in whom she seemed so interested. The family at Greenwood Seat, before Helen had become an inmate of the castle, had been visited by a few of the neighboring gentry, who had been drawn thither for various reasons, the chief of which were the reputed wealth of the Draytons, enabling them on a far more extensive scale than   HELEN COURTENA Y.         197 the owners of the estate to sustain the style of the old regime, and the society of the bright and intelligent daugh- ters, sole heirs of his princely fortune. And notwithstand- ing the impression made by the latter upon Helen, it must not be denied that when they were desirous of pleasing they lacked not good breeding and refinement of manner, having received every advantage from society and travel, and eminently possessing the charm, when they so willed it, of being agreeable companions. Added to these attractions at Greenwood Seat (for where there is aristocracy of talent it is always respected by the right-minded), Herbert, with the prestige of his early won fame, and as a man of practi- cal science, had acquired many sympathizers among his own, and admirers among the other sex, who felt proud to be numbered among his friends. Most prominent among these social neighbors, because connected with the development of this narrative, was the family of Lady Rosemay, consisting of herself, her two' daughters, and a son, the absent heir of the broad estates upon which she lived. The mother, weak in body and in mind, seldom stirred from her home, being content to play the part of the great lady and invalid provided no one doubted for a moment that she was a sufferer, or dared tA congratulate her upon looking better or well. To be con- sidered of delicate constitution and an object of pity and commiseration was the height of her ambition. An exist- ence at once calm, secluded, and objectless, can scarcely deserve so lively or stirring a name as that of life; and as her ideal of comfort was freedom from excitement and utter stagnation, wth this brief sketch we shall leave her to the retirement so congenial to her character. Her eldest daughter, whose unending occupation con- sisted in attending to her weak mother's wants and caring for her younger sister, was, without any desire to have the world in ignorance of the state to which she had arrived, with due reverence be it written, an old maid. That there are and must be many such in the higher walks of English life, where elder sons only are prized as being suitable matches for the daughters of the nobility, is a well known fact. Some of course remain single from preference, but     198       IIELEN COURTENAY. many a maiden, in her pride of birth, finds that she is of necessity unmated, unless in the great matrimonial mart she be chosen for wealth or personal beauty. How often an intense interest gathers around these lonely lives, these so-called Old Maids, in what land soever fate has cast them! How useful the part they in their wide charity, with but a few exceptions, play in the world! Let the mystery shrouding their solitary hearts be respected. Let the time be recalled with tenderness when they were young and full of hope, with those aspirations for happi- ness, with that desire for one to love beyond all the rest, and the legitimate yearning for the companionship of chil- dren of their own implanted by God in every human breast. Once they revelled, rosy-lipped, rosy-cheeked, dancing on the threshold of existence, music around them, fragrance in the air, beauty in the skies, until, learning their lesson of disappointment, the bounding step changed to a heavy, listless tread. Death came, perchance taking their loved one at the very altar of marriage, or poverty inter- vened with frightful hands extended wide, severing the united far apart, and crying with cheating voice for ever and for ever: "Wait." Or perhaps among the many some have discovered that fair promises prove false; that the arm once dedicated to protect them has stolen lovingly around another's form; the lips once swearing fealty whis- pering in other ears. Or perchance, in the long army 6F the unwedded there are some who, though asked in mar- riage, have irever met with the ideal of their early dreams; preferring a life of celibacv to a union of hands without a heart; and others, but few, un-Eought, unwonr r;"-These secrets, and many more of their veiled lives, give them a title to sympathy and respect, for, be sure, suffering in some sort has made them what they are. From the first mo- ment that the young bestow upon them their stereotyped name, and when, finding that they cannot escape their des- tiny, they meekly meet their fate; when their music is classed with the things gone by, their manners plainly out of vogue, their dress antiquated, their very talk savoring, to heartless youth, of departed things; when, uncertain what their sphere rightly is, wavering between a seat with the   HELEN COURTENA Y.        199 gay and noisy debUtantes in society or the staid matrons in their sombre silks; when, with a step half girlish, half wo- manly, and a blush of surprise that it has come at last, they take their places with the mothers in their quiet garb, let those whose lives have been blessed by domestic loves 'hold them by the hand. Let a corner be given to them cheerfully by the fireside, and the children be taught to welcome their coming; with gentle hands let their silver- streaked locks, that tell of departing youth in lines as plain as written words, be smoothed and caressed, and their fail- ing steps, which, had another destiny been theirs, might have been upheld by their own little ones, be kindly led; let them be cared for in sickness as they have cared for others through the long night-watches of pain and anxiety; and when death takes them, and their heart-throbs are stilled, let them be arrayed (for they have performed many a kindred office for strangers and friends) in snow-white garments befitting their purity and worth, and breathing a loving prayer over them, let them be left, solitary no more, to a better companionship than that of man. Alice Bentham had not been beautiful in her youth; nay, in middle age she attracted the eye far more than in the other hours of her fresh life. She was a patient-looking woman with the crown of trouble upon her head, streaks of shining grey, eyes not unused to tears, and a heart- though now beating regularly after the conquest over Self was won-not free in days gone by from stormiest sighs. Early in life she was beloved by a young curate, loving him in return, and though in every respect worthy to be a good woman's choice, her admirer was too slenderly endowed with this-world's goods, too lowly in name, to make a fitting match for Lord Rosemay's daughter, who had been brought up with every luxury that wealth or rank could procure. It was an easy thing for the proud father to forbid their marriage; a mere matter of words to break hei young heart in a single sentence; but it was not so easy to stop their constant meetings by the bedsides of the parish poor; to'keep them from administering to their wants to- gether; to prevent their eyes looking love, though their lips spoke it not. Days, weeks, months, and years thus '       ^X     2)O       HELEN CO URTENA Y. passed away, and the unsatisfied longing for her constant companionship, with a weak, overtasked frame, told their story in plain marks upon his face and form, the only saving thing being that which was denied him-the com- panionship of his beloved. Bred to implicit obedience, Alice Bentham dared not transgress her father's command, and win his curse by flying to her lover's arms and poverty; and in a desperate appeal, once more and for the last time asking his mercy, she was explicitly refused. Then came the final blow-a gradual decline of the young curate, and the silence of the grave; then came that death in life to her, an accusing monument to her stony-hearted parent, the sorrowful look, the world-weary tone of disappointment, the constant sigh, the meek air of resignation, and the joy- less smile of despair. Alas, for poor humanity! let us ask God's pity upon loving ones kept separate by fate. To have seen and known such is to have a sad memory for ever: two young, throb- bing hearts that should have beat in unison, entombed apart; two hands stretched to clasp each other, falling at last, helpless and hopeless; two lives that fain would have flowed together, severed by rocks and barriers, because Time gives no relief and offers no assistance. For those thus parted by destiny, until comes death, a forced or false marriage with another, or forgetfulness in sin,methinks the angels shed the bitterest tears that can be wrung from their sorrowful eyes at sight of mortal woe. Only once in Alice Bentham's life had she been known since her lover's death to be moved with any feeling deeper than sympathy for her suffering poor, or a watchful guar- dianship of her little sister, and this was when her father, calling her to him in his last moments, asked her forgive- ness for her blighted life and broken heart. Then seizing his hand, and throwing herself on her knees before him, she told him that the past would be forgotten if, in return, he granted her one imperative prayer. It was not for her- self, but another; and she held him fast, as it were, from the grasp of death, until her supplication was granted, It was no gigantic favor, no demand for gold or gain; simply as a compensation for all he had made her suffer, to give   HELEN COURTENAY.        201 Lilla, her young charge the right to dispose of her affec- tions where their object was morally worthy, without re- spect to wealth or rank; and with glazed and fast-closing eyes, in hearing of his wife and children, the dying father acceded to her petition. After this, Alice became more strict than ever in the guardianship of the child, the very latitude she had gained for her, where her affections were concerned, increasing her responsibility, and thus she became the object of so strict a surveillance and such constant questionings, that Lilla consequently became reserved towards the very being to whom she should have been most communicative. Like a tombstone whereon no record remains, passionless, earth- freed, the young girl saw in her sister everything to respect, but nothing warming or attractive; she shed no tears upon her bosom, nor gave vent to any joyous gushing laughter when she was near, but rather endeavored to hide all natu- ral outpourings of youthful exuberance, at the same time striving tocopy her as a model of propriety; striving, but signally failing in her endeavor. After ascertaining that neither of the two brothers at Greenwood Seat, from their advanced age, was likely to fascinate Lilla, and imagining that Herbert, devoted to scientific pursuits, would see but little of the child, she allowed her to be a constant visitor at the castle, seeing no evil in the future from such an association, but on the con- trary, good results from the example held out to Lilla by the studious habits of the sisters. Granting, even-so ehe reasoned, and carefully considering the matter at evlty point-granting, even, that Herbert should be attracted by Lilla, and she by him, what disadvantage would accrue from their mutual liking? None; but rather a most desi- rable union, if passionate attachment was the foundation. True he was a commoner, but his talents and reputation rendered him a fitting match even for Lord Rosemay's lovely daughter, that is, if they loved each other-her ever-  repeated, uppermost thought-her mania almost; since she had loved and lost, everything in life was secondary. Thus it came to pass that much of Lilla's time was spent with Cornelia and May, who admired her pretty ways and 9*     202       HELEN COUIrE NA . had awakened in her mind by their acquisitions higher aims than those for which she had heretofore shown a pre- ference; and with a groom who had grown grey in the service of their family, she often cantered over to Green- wood Seat on her favorite steed, and without the ceremony of a formal announcement, sought her friends in garden or hall. Lilla Bentham; but let her speak for herself. A sudden shadow at the entrance of the study-room caused Helen to look up, and an apparition of loveliness met her gaze. Belle Burton, the type of a bright village lassie ; Annie Lovell, somewhat higher in the scale of refinement; Julia Dearing, most fair in her angelic purity-were but steps ascending in beauty on the topmost platform of which stood a young girl framed like a picture in the surrounding doorway. Her hair of pale gold, drooped in loose curls about her face; her complexion was lily-white, save where a deep tint of rose crimsoned her cheeks, in which the color seemed not fixed, but changed with each changing emotion of her mind; her eyes were of that bright, steady blue we sometimes see in early morning skies; while her rich, ripe lips were moulded in the very curve of antique rule. Nor while nature was painting a face so rare, did she leave the form unmoulded by lines of grace, stamping upon all the signet of high birth, not obtrusively displaying it- self, but felt like a balmy breeze. Nor did the possessor of this aristocracy of blood appear to have any conscious- ness of superiority, wearing it as the queen wears her crown; it was no more a defect (to descend somewhat in the scale of creation) than is the proud bearing of a noble steed, who seems made for daintier uses than the rest of his kind. As she stood in the doorway, her riding-dress grasped loosely in her hand, the outline of her symmetrical figure in bold relief; a black plume mingling with her fair tresses, her young face expressing wonder at the new occupation of her friends, Helen longed that'the living image might change to marble and so become imperishable. The statue-spell was soont broken, however, by Lilla's walking, as it were, from her pedestal to mingle with the   I    HELEN COUR TET NA Y       203 mortals around her. She was a spoiled child, seldom re- buked by her mother, idolized by her sister, with many things yet to learn of the conventionalities of society. "Come, all," she said; " the sun is mounting higher and higher; soon it will be too late to see the quaint play of. its light that I told you of in thebeechrcopse." "Lilla," said May, rising, "this is Miss Tracy, our gover- ness; we are just in the midst of our German lesson." The bright, lovely apparition bowed as gracefully as a breeze-touched flower, smiling the while with benign gra- ciousness upon the group. "How I wish that I, too, could learn German," she ex- claimed; " from morning until night it is nothing but French at home, as though I were destined to live and die under Parisian skies." "We have just begun to-day," replied May; "what a pleasant arrangement it would be were you to take lessons with us." The blue of Lilla's eyes shone with fresh brilliancy. "Come with me now, now," she said impatiently; "it is but a short canter to Balthorp, and the thing can be decid- ed, yes or no." "Yes, come," said Cornelia starting up, and scattering the text-books far and wide. "You. forget," said Heleny gravely, your lesson is not yet finished; there must be no interruptions inhudy hours." She heard one answer, May's eternal laughl, she saw another, Cornelia's lowering scowl, as with trembling hands she gathered the books, reopening them where they had left off. "There are no locks or bars at Greenwood nowadays, I believe," said Cornelia, as -she saw Helen's preparations for a renewal of study; " farewell to tasks for a while; welcome the fresh air and free, delightful woods. Why sit you there wavering, May? Little Saxon-faced sister, come!" May arose irresolute, weak, and wise, her will leading her in one direction, her judgment in another. These were not children with whom Helen had to deal; and yet their actions were those of thoughtless youth. She remembered the requisition was to educate their hearts     204       HELEN COURTENA Y. as well as their heads, but at that moment felt unequal to either undertaking. If she could possibly, by enforcing her authority, compel them to remain, what a prospect would be before her; if they departed spite of her wishes to the contrary, what a signal failure she would encounter on this her first day of trial-a failure from which there was no hope of recovery. These conflicting courses of action were very trying, and our heroine was quite misera- ble between the two stormy and undecided points; her thoughts wandering back to the once dreaded boards of the theatre, where, admired and appreciated, she could sway a whole audience at will; and she felt like gladly exchang- ing her present life for that, since here as there, alike were troubles, trials, and mortifications. This mood, however, did not continue very long; certain reminiscences deciding her, before returning to the dreaded ordeal of a life upon the stage, to bear and forbear to the whole extent of her powers of endurance. For a moment she stood undecided; had the enemy pressed her then, they would have come off conquerors. Were it only May with whom she had to deal, her task, she knew, would be comparatively easy; but Cornelia, with that frown upon her brow, was a sad stumbling-block in her way; and it seemed to her not improbable, if roused to great vexation, the elder sister might return blows for words. She confessed to herself fear of her, not in argu- ment, but in physical force. Besides, they had disposed of her time as if it had been their own, in offering to have Lilla join their class; so that mingled with perplexity, there was a feeling of indignation on her part, causing the blood to rush in quicker pulsations through her heart, and color- ing her pale face with a kindling glow. But knowing that to give vent to her resentment in words would be the worst possible policy, just then, in assisting her to gain her point, she desired not to play upon the feelings of the tempted, but the temptress; and addressing Lilla, began her tactics like a practised general, hoping for victory because risking all. "I confess I should like myself to see this sunlight in the copse," she said, turning towards her; " how far have you to go "   HELEN COURTENA Y.        205 "Just four miles through the shrubbery, one over the meadow, one in the river road, on through the by-path, and turning to the left we are there." "t Then after your canter home, I suppose your plan is to take just this route this very morning " "If there is time; yes." "Wait for another day, and then be my guide to the spot?" "But will Cornelia and May wait?" "They were quite wiping to finish their lesson until you came, like a fairy tempter, to beguile them into the sun- shine. Besides," and Helen drew herself up with a haughty air, "you express a wish, to which they agreed, to join our German class. Now unless I consent to the plan, your desire and theirs are powerless, and no one, even on bended knees, could move me. For love I care not, for hate I care still less; but obedience to my rules, as long- as I remain here, I must have. I count myself as queen within these four walls, though beyond them I am nothing. Allow the lesson to be completed and I shall hold forth my sceptre of peace; set my wishes at naught, and Greenwood Seat holds me not another day. Accept my conditions, and I have it in my power to add much to your happiness, to tell you things which will interest you, to make the time you com- plain of as bearing so heavily upon you, less tedious. For you, Cornelia, I can sometimes drive away those unhappy frowns that have deeper root, I know, than upon your brow; for you, May, I can lift the burden of ennui which you complain oppresses you so sorely; and for you, bright, beautiful child, I can weave a garland of unfading flowers. This is the question to be answered: from henceforth obe- dience or rebellion? Happy hours at Greenwood Seat (and I confess that I should not like to go just yet), or the silent folding of-my Arab-tent and a departure from this place on the morrow's dawn." Helen spoke with strange power; on the stage her man- ner would have made her fortune; she was not her every- day self, but the actress who had moved a London world, fascinating her little audience with her sudden changes of demeanor, her queen-like bearing and gracious condescen-                      +     206       HELEN. COT7RTENA Y. sion. The trio stood silent for awhile, Cornelia and May regarding her with wondering gaze, Lilla, with eyes cast downwards, musing about many things; the sunlight in the copse, the promised German lessons, and most of all, the attractive stranger, so unlike every one she had ever seen, so very different from her staid sister Alice. She had laid aside her riding-cap and taken a seat at Helen's feet, while a mass of beautiful hair, escaping from confinement, hung about her lovely face. The impulse was irresistible to Helen to pass her hand gently over the thick cluster of curls, as unconquerable as to press a nestling infant closer to one's breast. The action, one of love and tenderness, was not lost upon Lilla, being quite unaccustomed to any demonstration of affection from her invalid mother and reserved sister, who gave her kind words many and often, but seldom a nearer evidence of devotion-hlle one being too much wrapt up in her real and imaginary ills, the other having given her first and last caress to one whom she had loved better than Lilla, caring not, while the memory of the passionate pressing of her lips on his emaciated hand remained, to let another take its place. Lilla's arm stole impulsively round Helen's waist, and laying her head lovingly for a moment upon her bosom, like a child who determines to be good, promised to do what Miss Tracy desired. May's careless laugh broke the silence. "A case of desertion from the ranks," she said, "punishable with death." "And as soldiers almost always desert in pairs," returned Cornelia, "I suppose that you too, May, will go over to the enemy?" "I think I shall," answered May; "and though I love my old commander, Captain Cornelia Drayton, better than any one in the wide world, when I think that she has enlisted in a bad cause, I hold it no treason to forsake her." "Do you love me, May, dearly, dearly?" asked Cornelia, with a sudden change in her manner from scorn to tender- ness. "Take me with you wherever you go, will you not, darling For sometimes I have strange misgivings here," pointing to her forehead, ' doubts of myself and you, and   HELEN CO URTENA Y        207 ail the world; fierce hates and fiercer loves ; bolder thoughts than ever mortal had on earth, and yet timorous heart- faintings unworthy even a child. The bridge of life seems tottering as I cross it; should you see me falling, falling, while I am treading upon it, will 'you promise to hold out to me your helping hand, little sister May?" "My daughters are strange." It needed not the father's confirmation to assure Helen of this. It was evident to the new governess, too, that May did not understand Cornelia; there was something there under- t neath those wild, mournfuil words, her shallow thought could not penetrate, for her answer was naught save the old laugh, as ill-timed as a song of mirth over a corpse, while she drew her sister caressingly towards the table, unresisting, after which they applied themselves with new diligence to the neglected task. And thus it came to pass that the spirit of peace brooded for a time over the vexed elements, Helen being most elated at her success in bringing about a compromise, while the day wore on into the time for that most pleasant of all meals, an English country lunch. It is the season of all others that brings the truant members of a family toge- ther, unrestrained by form; still in morning costume, with- out the stiff accompaniments of full dress, the talk is easy, the adventures of the morning related with spirit, the appetite keen, because of a healthy walk, a shooting excur- sion, or. a brisk canter over the moors. Helen and her pupil* were busily discussing the dainty viands provided for them, when they were joined by H;er- bert, who added to the geniality of the hour by recounting his experiences in obtaining a new specimen for his geolo- gical department; and when the repast was concluded, Lilla, reminding him of a promise he had made of showing her a certain experiment in his laboratory as wonderful as a juggler's legerdemain, the whole party proceeded thither. As the apartment devoted to this purpose was on the basement-floor adjoining that occupied by Herbert, Helen now had full opportunity to examine the exquisite proportibns of the pillars in the long corridor, the beauty of the stained-glass win- dows, and to hear from him the history of the castle, vary-     208       HELEN COUR TEfA Y. ing in many particulars from her own romantic ideal, toge- ther with sketches of the character of those who had dwelt there from an early period to the present owners of Green- wood Seat. Arrived at length at the laboratory, whose mysteries were to her entirely untrodden ground, our heroine had a realizing sense of Herbert's occupations. Heretofore she had known and understood as little of such things as one who looks only at the glowing coal that warms him knows of the mines from which it is dug. The names of what she saw therein were only a vague memory of her school-days, and now she regarded with wonder the practical uses of in- struments for weighing gases, poisonous and harmless, me- chanical powers, galvanic batteries, and many another appa- ratus whose uses were explained to her by their owner, together with fossil shells and rocks, and everything that was prominent in the world of science to which he belonged. She had often seen his name in London journals as marked out for eminence, while he was mentioned as one who by his discoveries had already been a benefit to mankind; now so singularly introduced into his very presence, the home of his thoughts, she understood something of what his ex- istence must be, his patient endurance, his sleepless nights of labor, and she classed him with the working spirits of the world-those who plough unknown seas of ice, dying with their wondrous story but half told, or those who have endured prison restraints, suffering for the truth for the good of their kind; or with men who dig the earth that others may have its precious ore, or till the land, that idlers may enjoy its fruits. Thinking thus, the ground upon which she stood assum- ed new importance in her eyes; it became a shrine to which pilgrims in after times might turn their steps to honor the memory of a great and good man. While Helen was thus musing and listening, Lilla lost her childishness, affecting a grave womanly air that ren- dered her doubly fascinating, while endeavoring to benefit herself by Herbert's explanations, and lift herself to the level of his mind. On the other hand, he evidently regard Ad her as a simple child, beautiful exceedingly--so beautidl   HELEN COURTENA .         209 that it were pardonable to let his eyes iest upon her as upon the light of Italy's skies. Below him in understanding and years, but above him in her sphere and destiny, her pre- sence was something to enjoy, like the flash of a meteor or a brilliant bird in its airy flight-worthy of all admiration, but not a part of his very life. As such he held her, no- thing less or more. And for the waster spirit of that spot,: consecrated to labor and truth, the hours were winged, inasmuch as he had anew listener; not Cornelia with her imperious, impetuous man- ner, nor May with her vacillating attention, nor Lilla with her abortive attempts at a clear understanding of his words, but an appreciative mind acquiring new ideas, a stranger, it is true, in his domicile, but far from being out of place there; one who had a soul to grasp, if not the deepest truths, to sym- pathize with him and enjoy what he thought fit to impart. Cornelia understood something of this-something of the position that Helen was assuming not only there but in their household. It was a rare pleasure to hear Herbert talk as he was then conversing; he was social, kind, gentle even to her, more so than ever before; and though she felt that Helen was his inspiration, her manner was so unassuming, so courteous, and yet so distant to him, that all idea ofjealousy was put to flight. The presence of the new governess had in it more the genial influence of sunshine than anything else to which Cornelia could compare it, resting upon all alike and partial to none. Then when she recalled her lucid teachings of a new language, her fine elocution in incidentally reading a few lines of poetry, her gift of music, her knowledge of chess-a passion with Cornelia-and her entire enjoyment of all that was beautiful in nature and art at Greenwood Seat, she took her as it were to herself, something in which she had a right, like a new book or ornament; thus it was not strange that when Helen an- nounced it was time to return to their duties she meekly and in a polite frame of mind obeyed the peremptory call. Then when his fair visitors had departed, Herbert felt that darkness had fallen on his spirit; perchance because his gentle guests had vanished, perchance because one among them had shed a brighter light upon im than all the rest.     210       HELEN COURTENAY. CHAPTER XVI. MANY morrows dawned at Greenwood Seat upon the self- exiled heiress, the days being varied by new successes and failures, hope and despair. May she had drawn somewhat nearer to her heart, having acquired over her that certain control which strong natures must ever exercise over the weak; but of her influence over Cornelia she was far less certain, for the latter followed her rules only when it was to her interest to do so. In her proud, self-sustained life, de- fiant of natural ties, eccentric and imperious, she seemed unwilling that any should enter to guide or sympathize save May, who, in certain moods, led her as though she had cast away her title to full-grown womanhood, and had assumed the tottering step and irresponsible mind of a little child. Still they were a happier household than when Helen first arrived, for the cheerful evenings foretold by her had come to them. Mr. Drayton recognised the young stranger, of whose antecedents he knew but two things, and neither of those in her favor; as one who had taken much bitterness firom his existence by her judicious management, and thanked her often and warmly for her persevering efforts in his daughters' behalf. Every day he thought less and less about the secret in his keeping of her actress life, since it had not spoiled her for better things; every day he was more ready to forgive her indifference towards his friend, since it secured to his home an inmate so cheerful, genial, and ac- complished. His brother, too, shook off his lethargic slumber at even-time, and like some ancient ruin over which the sunlight flickers, brightened and smiled when the others smiled at the pleasant jest, the spirited repartee, and Helen's inimitable powers of entertaining, or when she enlivened the group by music of song or instrument, kept time with head and hands to some remembered melody of his youth. There had come a change over all-a beneficial change, revealing itself more plainly in Herbert than the rest. He was no longer a rapt, selfish student, moody at times, and unsocial, but a pleasant and warm-hearted companion,   HELEN COURTENA Y.         2" charming with his bland manners and conversation, and his interest in the every-day events of life. The mysterious in- fluence breathed abroad, like the subtle spell of the unseen breeze, touched even him, arousing his best impulses, and -brightening his whole being with beauty, as surely as the dew silvers the thirsty fields. He did not yield at once to the new sense of pleasure that had taken possession of him, nor did he give it a name; it came so softly and gradually, and stole so gently into his heart, that he could not trace its first coming to any point of time. Like some voluptuary of the East, upon whom a narcotic drug is taking effect, he waited for its close approach, not rushing to meet it with wide-spread arms, but scarcely conscious of a more quickly beating pulse, while with fixed eyes seeing it afar, then nearer and more near, he likened it to an angel visitant borne towards him from cloud-land on an errand of hope, and peace. In his walks he felt its sweet guardianship, and it gave a glow to his being, and quickened his pace like the step of boyhood; in delicious reveries it steeped his soul with a flood of heavel-born light, bringing to his eyes a new expression as of a secret joy; it filled his lonely hours with companionship, and Whispered to him in the night:watches; i -it awoke every dormant'emotion of nobleness in his nature, opening his hand and sympathies to the poor, naking him kI inder to little children, and more watchful of qld age; for the sake of it, he forgave the rich and proud their faults; it taught him to be patient with the hasty, forbearing witu the stony-hearted worldling, and nerved his arm to strike a stronger blow for the right, while it lent to his ambition swift wings to soar onwards and upwards; above all, it brought him nearer than he had ever been to his Maker, God-this angel visitant, borne towards him from cloud- land on an errand of hope and peace. And to another had Helen's coming been as a new creation of buds and blossoms in the spring-time of hei sweet maidenhood.  Alice Bentham, yielding to Lilla's solicitations, had paid a visit to the fascinating stranger, and consented to trust her precious charge to her care so implicitly that it resulted in the almost daily companionship of the new friends. Helen had loved but little; parental,     212       HELEN COURTENA Y. friendly, passional affection seemed to have been denied hei For her father, for whom in childhood she had entertained  blind devotion, she had no longer a healthy regard; there was some alloy, even if it were ever so little, in her memory of him. Annie Lovell did not quite fill the empty place in her heart, and though she had clung in her loneliness to he: humble friend, she knew that another dwelt far deeper ii the emotional life of the young girl than she did; anothel had taken her away from parents and home and herself t( be merged altogether in him; her she could never expect tc behold again, and even if the chances and changes of life brought them once more together, the course of their lives running in channels so wide apart, could never mingle as ir the retired home which was so safe and quiet a refuge After Annie, Julia Dearing had come on her list of passions but the sentiment she inspired was more spiritual than temporal; with upraised eyes she had stood beside her with a mixture of awe and devotion; and though it was sweet tc Helen to exchange high thoughts with the invalid girl, she knew that she could approach no nearer, because their hearts would never have throbbed in perfect unison-the one being ripe for heaven, the other earth-bound still. Perhaps above these in her regard came Dr. Percival; but the feeling she experienced for this kind friend was far from being that of love; he was not the end that her soul desired, only a bright light held out to a traveller on his pilgrimage, who, though he is conscious that a far more brilliant abode lies in the distance, accepts the invitation extended to him, and is willing to abide where he will find a temporary rest-a refuge, not a certain home. When therefore the beautiful and bewitching child came as by magic into her presence, winning her heart by a caress and a lowly seat at her feet, Helen was drawn to her by an indescribable sympathy. She would not for the world have trusted her with what she cared to conceal; and yet to know that Lilla was near, to have her arms about her, or her fair head resting upon her bosom, to feel her sweet, infant-like breath upon her face, were to Helen a new and precious delight Then our heroine loved to stoop from books and her high position of teacher to listen to Lilla's almost child-   HELEN CO URTENA Y        213 ish prattle, and to watch her beautiful play of features as she unfolded her heart-secrets, momentous in her own esti- mation but trivial enough to others, while the bond between them strengthened every hour, Lilla finding in Helen's friendship, sowarm and attractive, a marked contrast to her sister's reserve and prudential manner, and Helen revelling in the fresh youth and unstained purity of the lovely child. Life was now a busy thing at Greenwood Seat; whether in study or in recreation Helen permitted no listless hours; and yet her pupils were not overtasked. Even Herbert spared daily from his self-inflicted hours of toil a por- tion of time for his German lesson and for a drive, ride, or walk in the companionship of Helen and her scholars. Sometimes the former wondered at his patience and docility when she saw him coming statedly with his books to the room set apart for study, and now considered peculiarly her own, for it was there that she had crowned herself queen, declaring her intention, according to the homage paid her, of holding out a screptre of- peace or making an open de- claration of war. And in those hours they, Hel iand Her- bert, learned to know each other well, not from many words, independent of the lesson, for seldom were they entirely alone, but from discovering that their tastes were alike, that their eyes kindled at the same thought, and that they looked to each other and not to the rest for sympathy, when the theme of their studies was one of interest or beauty. Then, too, Helen found that, lowly and modest as Herbert seemed, beneath the surface lay a will more gigantic than her own and an intellect by the side of which hers was but a shadow, while upon his features and form she saw a stampof power, a seal of strength, that crown of superiority which woman loves so well to recognise in her protector- man. In his turn Herbert's thoughts often wandered from his books to Helen, while he mused upon her great patience, the low murmuring cadence of her voice that never rose above a certain tone, her pure womanly nature shrinking and retiringi even when knowing that she could impart knowledge to others. Place her where he would in hia imagination, in what niche soever he chose to build her     214       HELENV COURTENA Y a shrine, in lordly halls or isolated from the world, in the hut of the poor giving comfort, or in the quiet of home with little children around her, she seemed not out of place, least of all in the last-and that, like every thinking man in his pictures of domestic happiness, he valued as woman's fitting sphere. It is the thought of that, the Home, which never quite forsakes him in all the successes or failures of exist- ence, whispering through the hours like the breezes through the leaves, and with beckoning hand and sweet invitation saying: "Art thou troubled? Come home; here are con- solation and sympathy. Art thou sick and life-weary  Here is strength for thy fainting soul. Hast thou been successful? Here wilt thou find smiles answering to thine own, and a hand and heart dedicated to thee alone." Then the faint pulse beats with a fuller throb of joy, and to the downcast spirit comes a ray of hope; for luminous afar in the gloaming, stands out a picture which the worker loves to call to mind-the cheerful hearth, the look of glad- ness, the warm welcome, and the fond caress. At first, when married life is new, the home shines like a friendly light in the distance; it is a fresh pleasure, and his own, shared with only one other dearer to him than all the world besides. A bounding form rushes to meet him on the threshold, a dear voice relates to him with a grand air of importance the simple events of the day ; a sweet face looks smiling or fearful, and sure of sympathy, up into his own, even amid the details of her wondrous cares sparing many a word of endearment to her attentive auditor. Later in life man prizes the roof where he abides f(r its associations; his children gather there; the wife of his affections more subdued than of yore, faded and careworn with the signet of nights of watching and days of mental and bodily toil upon her face and form, toil for him and his, meets him with a graver smile, a more sedate caress, and though deep lines are upon her brow, his coming half Smoothes it to youth again, while from his eye is banished the perplexed look of the day, and he calls her still with deep tenderness in his voice, that name beyond which woman's aspirations need care to mount no higher, the Angel of his Home! It is a beautiful idea that of this guiding-star to man's devi-   HELEN COURTENAY.        215 -ous steps; it is something besides desire for comfort-it is instinct; and wives, mothers, and sisters, knowing that it is theirs to make the flame on the domestic altar brilliant and attractive, or to smoulder it in gloom, should cherish the privilege ,pf kindling the blessed light and make it a pro- minent thought through all the hours and days of life. Lilla had never forgotten the promised visit to the beech- copse, nor had Helen ceased to remember it, for the former had fairly won a holiday by persevering attention to her studies, and a day was fixed upon for their excursion. They decided to take it on horseback; Herbert was to be of the party, and Lilla to act as guide. An imposing array was presented as they set off from Greenwood Seat, radiant with joy, the bluest skies above them, and the hope-light of youth their own. Helen was entirely in her element. The freedom of her old country home seemed hers once more; she had spent many hours of her life in equestrian exercise, and it was natural to her to feel herself borne along by h powerful and spirited steed. It must be confessed, how- ever, with due reverence to the heroine elect of our tale, that her appearance was far less imposing than Cornelia's, whose tall commanding figure was as immovable as though the rider and her horse were one, her habit fitting closely to her elegant form, her tall hat adding to her dignity, her clear chiselled profile fully defined against the bright morn- ing sky. One would have judged, and rightly, that, a master had trained her to guide the animal jupon which she rode according to written rules, to sit in a certain statue- like attitude, to bend her wrist and. gather her reins with unerring precision. But with Helen it was far different; she followed no rules; her light figure swayed to and fro as gracefully as a lily on the wave; her eyes anywhere but in military style, straightforward, were as restless as her flut- tering heart, now looking sky-ward, now towards the right or the left, now bent upon the grass beneath her, while frodm her lips flowed an endless streami of words and laugh- ter. The others, May and Lilla, were as fhey ever appeared; the first pretty, gentle, cheerful; the other lovely beyond expression-a thing for the sunlight to rest upon, or for the moon to kiss with loving beams.     216       HELEN COURTENAY. Herbert kept close to Helen; he could not, would not, remove himself from the genial atmosphere surrounding her -his angel floated near him upon that day of sunlight, al- most touching him with her radiant wings. Cornelia some- times lingered near, but oftener left them to make wider excursions through the woods, and rejoining them at inter- vals; while May and Lilla, the pioneers, rode side by side, the latter, proud of her offce of guide, looking hack from time to time for a word of sympathy or a smile. Their way for some time lay along the margin of a wooded stream, through scenes of quiet beauty, where the beech and fir cast their shadows across the water; sometimes, through an unexpected vista a line of blue hills rose in the distance, blending in harmony with the glowing skies, or there appeared meadows dotted with grazing kine, while sheets of gorse and furze occasionally stretched before them, upon which the shade and sunshine played, giving a semblance of life to the otlerwise inanimate stillness of the noonday landscape. "How different," said Herbert to Helen, as with slow pace they followed the winding of the quiet stream, " is this thread of silver from the boiling, furious mass of waves that dashed around us on the night when first we met?" "And yet we ourselves were as calm as now," she re- plied. "I know not, when I look back, wherein the source of my strength lay. Certainly from no deep religious trust, for it is but lately that I have learned the full significance of prayer. You, as a man, had long ago, even in boyhood, buckled on your armor of endurance, and were ready for the storms of life and other storms, but H-I was ready for neither, and yet I stood as impassive as the figure-head of the ship, feeling unmoved the very spray of the waves upon my face." "You aaid," answered Herbert, "if I remember aright, something which may explain the secret of your fortitude- that you were not yet ready for death, which seemed to me to mean you thought death not ready for you. You said, too, that you were bound to life by one great purpose, cir- cumstances forcing you to labor for another's welfare, and that you must live to accomplish your task. Is this as true now as then?"   HELEN* COURTENA Y.       217 She mused awhile upon his words, and that he had remem- bered her own so well; then sighing deeply, her answer was an echo to his closing sentence: "Yes, it is as true now as then." "Can no one help you? Man was made for man. May not friendship's brave heart and strong arm assist you; or can you not, unaided, cast the burden away, and free your- self from its heajy weight ." "No," she said, thinking of her father's' unworthiness, "I must bear it with me to the grave." "What is it?" he asked abruptly; " tell one who would serve you if he could." "I cannot," she replied; "do not tempt me more. I am showing you deeper ipto my heart than I ought to show you or any mortal; and yet-and yet your sympathy is so welcome, I feel so surely that you would understand me, be sorry for and befriend me, if you could, that I forgive my- self, the only being to whom I am accountable on earth, for telling you what I have.'t "Tell me more, tell me all," he said, forgetting that it was a secret in his interest for her.  Looking up to him with her eyes brimful of unshed tears, she shook her head sadly, and checking her pace to a walk, spoke earnest words of gratitude to him who was so ready to help her. "I thank you for your kind interest in me," she replied; " a stranger, whose very existence has been a blank to you until now. Believe me, I am not ungrateful for your proffered aid; but even though armed giants were to spring up in my cause, I must still bear the burden alone. Only this can I say for all your kindness-God grant that through all the years of your life you may never have the uplifting and bearing of a cross as heavy as mine." Saying this, her eyes wandered with dreary glance from the skies earthward; then, as if striving to forget, to shut up the avenue to memory and thought, she urged her horse to a brisk canter, and as they cleared the space over a gentle acclivity, she saw the rest of the party at a little distance, apparently motionless in the road. ' See," she exclaimed, turning to Herbert and pointing to the group, "they beckon us on;. they appear to have dismounted, and yet we cannot have reached Lilla's beech-copse yet! 10     218       HELEN COURTENA Y. With rapid pace they passed over the intervening ground between themselves and the rest; but on reaching them, found Lilla lying upon the ground, and moaning with pain at every effort to rise. In answer to their inquiries, they were told that her horse had unexpectedly started at an object in the wood, and losing her balance, she had been thrown off, the consequence of which was a sprained ankle that prevented her from remounting. It was plain that she could not walk, nor could she ride home; all that remained for her was to be borne to a neighboring cottage until the groom could be sent for a carriage to convey her back. Herbert approached a step nearer in order to lift and bear Lilla away in his arms, when Cornelia, who had been silent heretofore, declared, in no measured terms, that he could not, must not do this, and that it was a mad and foolish scheme. "And yet, mad and foolish as it may appear," answered Herbert, "to me it is the only way. Can you suggest, Cornelia, one more calculated to give Miss Bentham ease, or can you say why you object to this?" The blood rushed to Cornelia's face, but she was silent, daring not to give the reason-burning with destructive flame within her breast; but she acted as her feelings prompted, and stood between Herbert and Lilla, defiant and gloomy, the others being spectators to her strange de- meanor. Meantime poor Lilla, caring little for what was passing, only prayed with tearful eyes for something to be done to ease her of the agony she was suffering. "Stand aside, Cornelia," said Herbert kindly; " the poor child is unhappy, and in pain." "Pain is a common thing," she answered moodily; "it floats about in the air; it lights at will upon its victims; its home is the human heart. Think not that only Lilla Bentham knows what it is to feel pain." "Will you stand aside " he asked kindly again. "No, I will not," she answered, in a quick angry tone. "Then I must force you gently, very gently from my path, Cornelia. Humanity alone should make you chari- table." He extended his hand to draw her from his way, but   HELEN COUR TENA Y.       219 she sprang from him fiercely, and stood panting with fury like a lioness at bay, watched him for an instant as he en- circled Lilla's form with his arm and raised her, while her head, with its profusion of golden ringlets, lay close against his breast; then turning away from the group, and mutter- ing a few words to Helen, who was nearest, cursing the day that brought them to that spot, she sprang on-her horse without assistance, and rode away as rapidly as his fleet feet could carry her. May's first impulse was to follow and overtake her sister; but considering the speed at which she had ridden off, and her own want of knowledge of the wood paths, she was in- duced to remain quietly with the rest, while they assured her that it was reasonable to suppose Cornelia would rejoin them on their homeward way. In the meantime the little procession passed onwards towards the cottage, Herbert being most tender and careful of his precious charge; but the more considerate he became, and the more she required his care, did Helen feel a sharp, subtle pang, scarcely understood, but which, bringing a long line of evils in its train, is so well known by the name of jealousy. She felt as though that fair-haired girl had no right to lie so passively within Herbert Drayton's encircling arms; as though, after all, it would have been best to have left her on the sward alone and unattended. She hated to look upon them, and yet a strange fascination made her watchful of their every word and gesture. She knew that she was wrong to indulge in such unchristian thoughts, but deep in her heart, notwithstanding this, she could not help responding to Cornelia's words: "It is not Lilla alone who feels pain." It was a dull, gnawing sensation of unrest that she experienced, as though her life would never more be free from sorrow; a sense of being shut out from happiness and light; a longing to be alone, that she might be rid of the tears pressing so heavily upon her eyelids; a knowledge that her hands were clenched as though to strikeIa blow for some personal injury done to her, though what and how she could not determine; a cruel idea that Lilla's sprained ankle was a pretence; a fiercer wish than all the rest that courage might be given her to tear one so false from her     220      HELEN COUR TENA Y. resting-place, leaving her to any fate awaiting her-scorch- ing suns, or tramp of horses' feet, or midnight dews, or pitiless cold. But lo! in an instant after, the clouds passed away from her mind, the sunshine became more golden, and nature more beautiful than ever. Arrived at the cottage door, a kind woman had relieved Herbert of Lilia's slight weight, placing her carefully upon the best couch afforded by her simple home, while Herbert turned with beaming eyes, and as though be had done a good action, to meet Helen as she approached the house. "She is so grateful, so lovely in her gratitude," said he, "for my poor aid, that, like a miser craving yet more gold, I long to win the gratitude of others. Ah, Miss Tracy, if yon had not positively forbidden me to urge the matter, I might grow eloquent in telling you how light the burden was, how strong are my arms and my heart; how, if you would but lay the life-trouble that so oppresses you upon another, it would be but a feather's weight." Cautious with all else, Helen was strangely incautious where this Herbert Drayton, the companion of that night of storms, was concerned. He swayed her as the wind moves a reed; she trembled if he frowned, she grew bold if he approved. Words cannot express her longing to tell him all; not because prompted by duty, as in Dr. Percival's case, but with a yearning desire to showAhim every secret of her heart. As her mind was framing what she desired to say, he looked at her eagerly, so eagerly, with such a desire to serve her in his eyes, that his very earnestness brought back her self-command. "I was imprudent, wrong," she said hastily; "I should have been silent in that hour of danger; I had no excuse, even in the thought that we should never meet again, to lift up so much as a corner of the veil covering my mystery. Since we have met, since fate has so strangely thrown us together, from this time forward let it be a sealed book between us; for believe me, there is no help for me-none." With an imperative gesture of silence she left him, and hastening to Lilla, embraced her with a love from which all jealousy had departed, while by her cheerful and pleasant   HELEN COURTENAY.         221 converse, she made her half forget her pain until the car- riage came to bear them home. In the meantime Cornelia, with frantic haste, had ridden on, a tumult as of hell in her heart and brain, towards the river's brink. Where the waters swept around in a whirling eddy, and the inclosing, over-reaching trees made a pro- found solitude, she dismounted from her steed, and looked wistfully at the dark and rapid floods Twice she raised her arms as though to spring from the bank and end her turbu- lent, passion-tossed existence in oblivion; then a better thought came to her, and kneeling with uncovered head, she uttered a single prayer taught her in childhood by a watchful mother; ere it was concluded, however, a wilder, fiercer wave of feeling rushed over her as memory recalled the imaoge of Herbert Drayton bearing Lilla in his arms, and she pressed her hands to her eyes as if to crush the reality of the vision that had entered there. At length from that crouching attitude of despair she arose slowly to her full height, smiling at some thought that seemed pleasant for her to dwell upon. "There is something better than that, " she said aloud, pointing to the waters; " something far sweeter than forgetful- ness-revenge." Then remounting her horse, she rode rapidly homewards, reaching the castle just as they had concluded that she had lost her way, and were making plans to go in pursuit of her. It would have been quite unnecessary, she said, the beauty of the day having tempted her to prolong her ride; she had enjoyed the solitude inexpressibly. This was all the explanation she chose to give, no one doubting her or imagining that only a single chance thought had in- tervened between her living, breathing self and the river- bed as her place of sepulchre. During Cornelia's protracted absence, for the party had arrived at Greenwood Seat some time before she made her appearance, Helen had an opportunity of testing her in- fluence, and then, if ever, thought it needful to exercise it. Mr. Drayton, becoming seriously alarmed at Cornelia's non- appearance, exhibited his concern in a restless bearing of impatience, bordering upon anger. To reason with him was out of the question; to excuse Cornelia as useless; some-     222       HELEN COURTENAY. thing deeper and stronger than mere argument was required to calm him. While he was pacing his library, deliberating upon the best measures for him to pursue, whether to send or go in search of the absent one, or to wait patiently her return, May was standing upon the terrace anxiously watching the way she knew her sister must come; her usually placid face wearing an expression of deep trouble, her eyes tearful, her merry laugh gone. Helen thought by these signs, as she approached her, that beneath her ever-smiling, meaningless countenance there must be some soul, and prayed for power to sound its depths that she might teach her the duty due to her father in his present agitated state of mind. May sprang to meet her, questioning whether there were any tidings of her sister. Helen shook her head, and throwing her arms around her companion's waist, an action as rare as it was condescending on the part of the proud governess, told her there was some one within the castle needing her far more than Cornelia, who was probably en- joying her lengthened ride, and would return soon. "I know whom you mean," said May; "I suppose that he has one of his old nervous attacks; Cornelia calls them comet vagaries, for they appear to have no law and obey no grand harmonious movement in the order of nature." "Merciful heavens! May," exclaimed Helen, "do you speak of your father thus; him to whom you owe everything on earth, whose happiness is bound up in yours, who would be entirely alone bereft of you and Cornelia! Do you for- get how sacred your charge is-no less sacred than his was when he watched you in infancy Tell me, do you forget?" Helen, drawing her arm from May's waist, looked upon her with a gaze that she could not meet. "What would you have me do, Miss Tracy?" asked the latter; "I never offend him; I have moulded myself to the height of his ambition into a classical scholar; I never disobey him. What more would you have of me?" "If you have no sins of commission where your father is concerned, have you none of omission? Does it never occur to you that some day in the future you may have children of your own? Fancy them slighting your grey   HELEN  CO URTENA Y.      223 hairs, ridiculing your sufferings, avoiding your society. Oh, May, pause for a moment, and think of it! A lonely youth is fearful enough; but a lonely old age, when one has outlived the cheating hopes of life, when even death, which you and I look upon with such horror, is welcomed as a friend; when one shrinks away into himself, fearing lest he may intrude upon the province and pleasures of youth- then, May, should you not like the loving arms of your children to twine around you, smoothing your sure pathway to the grave?" "You frighten me, you always frighten me, Miss Tracy, when you talk about my father; old age, death, are terrible things; tell me what I can do to make them less so to him . And yet our lives have always been so apart, except where he has directed my studies, that I doubt if at this late day he would accept my sympathy." At all events you can but try, and so feel conscious rectitude in doing your duty. Go. this instant, May, and give him what comfort you can." " ow?" Converse with him, soothe him, caress him, if you can do it without hypocrisy; be to him what God meant you to be-a daughter, a support." "You have a strange way, Miss Trcay, of compelling people to obey you; come with me and I. will do your bidding; but remember, if my father does not accept the new demonstration, I shall tell him that you alone are to blame." They went, the counselled and the counsellor, to the library, where, restlessly walking to and fro, Mr. Drayton awaited the return of his daughter. It is woman's natural gift to console. Winding her arm within his, May said what words she could, feeling what she expressed, for a hasty glance revealed to her that his hair was whiter and his step more trembling than not many weeks before; then recollecting what Miss Tracy had told her, that death, the inevitable, hovered closely over such, she drew nearer to him and impulsively asked his forgiveness for yers of coldness and neglect. Helen's work was over; the two, once so estranged, needed no interpreter, and, considering herself an intrider,     224       HELEN COURTENA Y she hastened away, not, however, before hearing May say: "It was Miss Tracy who led me to you; it was she who said what I feel to be true-that we should both be happier for this in the future." It was a sweet thought to the young governess that their hands were clasped lovingly, the father's face literally beam- ing with joy; nor did she fail to recognise upon his coun- tenance, when they met again, a look full of kindness directed especially to her, and reconciling her to al the dis- comforts of her sojourn at Greenwood Seat. Very soon after May's interview with her father, Cornelia returned, and the sun went down upon a rejoicing and, in outward appearance, a united family. CHAPTER XVIL THE space of about a fortnight brought Lilla once more back to Greenwood Seat, the sprain from which she had suf- fered, though painful at first, soon yielding to remedies and patience; but even in that short time she had become more womanly in her demeanor, graver in her speech, and more reserved to Herbert, while she showed an increase of affec- tion for the young governess. It was a privilege to her to wander with Helen on the lonely terraces around the castle, or in the more solitary woods, and to pour forth her soul in words of love and tenderness, leaving the inmost recesses of her child-woman's heart to her friend's inspection. Some- times the latter checked this unbounded confidence as not by right her own; but any refusal to listen to her juvenile grievances, her trials and aspirations, disheartened Lilla so much that Helen, more through indulgence than interest, turned a willing ear to what she had to impart. Occasion- ally her invalid and faulty mother was the theme, or her cold but "perfect" sister, or her noble brother, who came at intervals to his castle home from his gayer life abroad. Often Cornelia and May, so kind, yet so hard to understand, were her topics of conversation, and oftener still, Herbert   HELEN COURTENA Y.       225 Drayton, who stood as upon a pedestal in her thought, while she knelt in worship at his feet. When speaking of him, his kindness upon the day of her accident, his gentleness and care, her cheek glowed, her eyes brightened, and she was touched as with a new radiance, while Helenj gazed upon her as the most beautiful creation it had ever bien her privilege to look upon. But there came an hour when her words defied all the bounds of prudence, and when Helen saw the imperative necessity of putting an end to her confidence and unregu- lated fancies.. Could she, also,'have known all the conse- quences of Lilla's imprudence, she would have been even the more alarmed at the license of her words. Having returned from a noonday walk together, Lilla proposed, before taking her departure, to repair to Herbert's laboratory in search of some fossils which he told her she could obtain at any time convenient to herself. Helen ever avoided intruding upon him without a special invitation, but sometimes when she and her pupils knew that he was absent they repaired there to examine a new mineral in his collection, or some curious plant freshy-gathered. On the present occasion she was quite willing to accompany Lilla, the latter having assured her that there was not the least probability of interrupting Mr. Drayton, as she had certainly seen him cross the field and walk in the direction of the woods. Lilla was, however, mistaken in her supposition. Herbert's own apartment joined his laboratory, and in this, unknown to his visitors, he was sitting. He was in a dreamy, indolent mood, enjoying the genial sunshine and an idle hour, an almost unknown luxury to the indefatigable student. In his heart were vague thoughts of future happi- ness, a realization of the dreams of his early manhood, where one dear companion, one beloved woman, stood be- side him, pure, beautiful, sympathizing, a mortal, yet a ministering angel. Never before had the vision taken a decided shape; but now it was almost tangible, as with a great heart-throb of joy he breathed the loved one's name, and wandered in thought with her through earth's scenes of interest, amidst the busy byways of the city's mart, or  in the more quiet walks of nature, beholding the lofty 10*     226       HELEN COURTENA Y mountain, the slumbering valley, the blue of heaven's skies. In these and humbler senses, the pleasures of a rural life, the busy hay-time, the children in the cottage porch, the shady wood, the murmuring rivulet, he met her answering smiles. Seated there, wide awake, he dreamed the dreams of youth-hopeful, gorgeous, colored by hues from his own thought, mingled with memories of one who had uncon- sciously stolen away his heart, and in whose keeping it would remain then and for ever. Suddenly his day-dream vanished, the stillness being broken by approaching footsteps. Conjecturing the truth that his little friend Lilla had come on her errand as he had directed, and supposing, after taking his gifts of fossils, she would at .once depart, he remained quietly in the ante- room, longing for silence again that he might renew his in- terrupted musings. But on a nearer approach of the visitors so unceremoniously entering, he detected the footsteps of two persons, and became busy in speculating upon their purpose and identity. The door between the rooms being open, he had no 'other choice than to hear a conversation that quickened his pulses, depriving him for a time of the power of determining how to act under the peculiar circum- stances in which he found himself placed. He knew from the sound of the footsteps that they had made a circuit of the room, then that the guests appeared to be departing as quietly as they had come; but on the very threshold he was conscious they had paused, while a voice he knew to be Lilla's, guarded but clear, trembling but earnest, spoke words causing his heart to pulsate as it had scarcely ever done before, and the hot blood to mount in impetuous flow to his brow. Again it seemed to him from what followed that she must have made a slow survey of the apartment and all its belongings, and then with an impulse not to be repressed, had given utterance to the thoughts uppermost in her mind. "Miss Tracy," she said with passionate intonation, "I could almost worship the man to whom all this belongs; not as a child, but as a full-grown woman, for affection is not ruled by the sluggish measure of years. It is sweet to love him; it is my existence, the very inspiration of my breath.   HELEN CO URTENAY.        227  To look at anything upon which his eyes have rested, to lay my hand on anything which he has touched, is a joy to my inmost heart, which you, in your cold, prudential life, could scarcely understand-no, never." These words were poured forth in guch a rapid stream of untaught eloquence, that Helen, taken by surprise, and filled with consternation, could scarcely command herself to check and rebuke the imprudent speaker; tut when she paused to take breath, gravely, almost sternly, she told her upon what dangerous ground she was treading, and that the very walls might reveal her secret to other ears. And to Herbert, in full hearing of that frantic confession, honor called loudly that he should let them know of his presence, but he took the ground against its promptings, arguing that the words he had accidentally overheard left such a course of action impossible. How could he confront one who had spoken such burning sentences of passion without bringing the blush of' shame to her cheeks? Though his indecision as to what course of conduct to pursue was but momentary, it amounted to mental agony, until his better judgment usurped its rightful place, convincing him that it would never answer to betray to Lilla Bentham the'whole extent of her rashness. Moreover, he argued it were best to let her depart un- conscious of his proximity, for-even should she renew the subject then and there, she could utter nothing stronger or more reckless than that which had been revealed to him. But again honor whispered: "Presupposing that more may be spoken, now is your duty, since you can reason and temporize, to close your ears resolutely, aye, to cut off your right hand, or to pluck out your right eye in the spirit of the bible, before you are so false as to listen to another syllable, since what you have heard was accident, what you may hear design. -But Herbert Drayton was neither faultless nor a martyr, something stronger than curiosity triumphing; and he deli- berately waited for what might follow, quieting his con- science with the problematical idea that Helen's counsel to Lilla, whatever it might be, would help him in his great strait, and point out a way for him to act. It was 'an un- usual position for poor, weak human nature to occupy; if     228       HELEN COURTENAY other casual words had come first, Herbert's duty would have been plain and easily accomplished; for, seeking their presence, he would have revealed to them his near neigh- borhood; but from the very nature of Lilla's confession it was impossible now to appear before them. "Lilla, Lilla, beware," answered Helen; "your words are far too strong for your years. Even to me, you must not utter such things. Consider what you are, what he is-you a child, he a man-the companion of men in age and in un- derstanding. You high-born, exclusive; he, though boast- ing the aristocracy of nature-God's aristocracy-a com- moiler, one of the class which your long line of ancestors would scorn to mate you with. Lilla Bentham, beware what you say; guard with jealous care even what you think." "1 know what I am saying; I know what I am thinking," returned Lilla, recklessly. "I say, I think that of all God's creations, he is the wisest, noblest, best. If he would only look upon me as the sun looks upon the lowly flower, I would brighten beneath his gaze. It may have been wrong, wicked, perhaps you will say; but resting upon his breast, and near his beating heart, when his kindness prompted him to aid me, I envied not the angels, and as for a life spent with him as his wife, being a descent to the Benthams' proud blood, it would instead elevate them and me heaven- high. Or, if it be within the limits of possibility for him to desire the companionship of such a one as I, to ask me to become his bride, think you that any power on eairth could come between me and his wish No, I should be doubly armed; first with my own constancy, next with the death- bed words of my father: ' So that you love worthily, love and wed whom you choose.' And as for his worthiness, Miss Tracy, confess it, is he not the bravest, gentlest, strongest, noblest being upon earth Can you, even you, with your stern notions of goodness, see any fault in Herbert Drayton?" The listener waited in vain for an answer to her question, holding his breath lest he should lose a syllable of the ex- pected reply; instead of it, he heard the governess almost angrily bid Lilla cease her wild ravings; then came a plea from the latter to be 'alowed to remain but for one moment   HELEN COURTENA Y.        229 longer in the air hallowed by his breath; then a departing step, which he knew to be Helen's, passing from the room; next a few passionate words of love spoken by Lilla to the inanimate objects around; a quick, light tread following Helen's, and at last an unbroken silence. Thus the knowledge came to Herbert Drayton that he was loved with more fondness, more desperation, than he ever imagined he could have inspired, by one who was above all other women in beauty, who could be trained by careful culture to be his sympathizer and companion, whose rank alone made her a desirable choice. What more need he desire? No obstacle could be raised between them; she herself had plainly said as much; and the very notoriety of such a union would advance him -in his darling pursuits to the consideration and fame he coveted. He looked down into the deeps of his heart to measure with nicest exactness its wants and capacities, and to see what impress was left there by those strong words of a lovely and loving woman; but no glowing, living characters of answering affection could he find; it throbbed not, nor thrilled with the know- ledge of her great passion; he took all her words, her beauty, influence, rank, and placed them as it were in one scale; in another Helen's expected utterance, the softest sigh struggling up from her bosom, the shadow of a hope that she might in some sort acknowledge his worthiness, and the latter far outweighed all the rest. Then the purpose grew strong within him that some day not far distant, God willing, he would say to her in words something resembling Lilla's questioning: "Anz I good enough, gentle and strong enough, to win so great a boon as thy love " So thinking, the future. stretched oat before him as a pathway strewed with flowers; the air was redo- lent with whispers of happiness; there came to him aspira- tions for goodness and greatness which his soul had never felt before, because of the idea of their separate lives min- gling and flowing on in one unbroken current through earth's devious paths, and at length amid the blissful bowers of Paradise. Hope colored his fancies, hope assured him if her heart were free, she could not, would not, reject a love so mighty and all-absorbing as his own.     230       HELEN COURTENA Y. Heavy rains keeping Lilla from Greenwood Seat for many days, the struggle which Herbert thought he would be obliged to make to preserve his manner towards her the same, that she might not for a moment imagine her secret was known, was comparatively easy when next they met. His first surprised feeling had passed away, and he had gradually schooled himself to believe that he was laboring under the delusion of a dream, or that her ravings were those of a spoiled child, having not the deep meaning which he had given them on the day they were spoken. In addition to this, an event occurred leaving but little thought for aught else than its desolating sorrow, causing him to shun the society of those who loved him so well, and turning the sparkling current of his life into a turbid and darksome stream. It was mail day at Greenwood Seat. After an interval of sunshine, heavy rain had set in again. The inmates of the castle were busy with their several avocations; Cornelia and May practising their music, in which they became daily more interested, and Herbert and Helen in the study-room -alone.  Blessed thought for him, alone; no other voice, save hers, to break the stillness; no presence to jar upon the harmony of the charmed moments; not another breath to disturb the delicious atmosphere surrounding them like a halo. Precious hours are these to loving hearts-those hours belonging exclusively to two! Affection shrines them in memory for years, as gems are hidden in a casket from common eyes. Sometimes their possessor looks over them with blinding tears, sometimes with heart-thrills of joy; often they help to illuminate a dreary, lonely life; often, though others know itnjot, they are worn as unseen amulets upon the breast, charming away evils, sorrow, and discon- tent, making earth's weary burdens lighter upon the wearer's bosom. Thank God for thought and memory-the world can never be altogether dark with these friendly lamps hung out to cheer and guide the pilgrim on his way! What mattered it to Herbert Drayton whether the skies were gloomy and the rain descendingin torrents, when the flame within his breast burned with a clear, brilliant glow;   HELEN COURTENAY.        231 or that the heavens frowned, when Helen made a heaven with her smile!  There was a short pause in the lesson, each endeavoring to remember a passage they had met with some days before, teach hanging over the same book trying to recall and find the forgotten words. With one hand Helen turned the pages of the volump; the other lay with upturned palm and careless grace upon the table at which they were sitting. With as sure an instinct as the newly fledged water-fowl seeks the wave; with as great an impossibility to resist that instinct as for a man dying of thirst to put away a saving draught from his lips; and with the purpose then and there of asking her to be his wife-Herbert laid his hand upon Helen's, and in the full thrill of joy which the action brought, the thought that even those weak, slender fingrs could guide him in his strength to a noble and useful life, he was silent for a minute's duration. For a minute, too, whose bewildering emotion she could not comprehend, her hand lay trembling beneath his, but for that time only. Starting from her seat, she rose and looked down upon him with flushed face and tearful yet proud eyes. A memory had come to her even then, a common, every- day story, told her by a friend across the ocean, whose life and hopes had been wrecked by just such an occurrence as that. One had gained her love by weeks of devoted atten- tion, acting as if she were his every thought as she waited patiently and in vain for the words from him which would sanction their affection before all the world, clasping her hand in his the while, and whispering low syllables in her willing ear. She was wrong, so sobbed this friend of Helen's, with tears of bitter contrition, to allow so close an intimacy; but her faith was entire until the sickening day when her dream was dissolved by hearing of his engagement to another. His attentions to her had meant nothing, he said; he was, only amusing himself with a harmless flirtation. "Meant nothing  A harmless flirtation " and yet it broke her heart. Because Helen felt that Herbert's intercourse with her might be of this very character, and because she had pro- mised her friend to take warning by her experience and not \.     232       HELEN C 0URTENA Y to jeopardize her happiness by indulging in a pleasure so brief but unsatisfactory, she turned the full light of her mournful eyes upon her companion and said with a dignity which he had never before seen her assume: "Is this right? Is it kind?" "Yes, right, upon my soul," he answered. "Listen to me, Helen." "No," she replied, interrupting him, "you have done me a grievous wrong. You forget our position; you forget that I am a paid governess in your household, with a cha- racter for stability to sustain which I must not forfeit by look, word, or deed. What you have done, what I have done by permitting it, never would have taken place had others been present. It was wrong, then, was it not? And yet, merciful Heaven teach me what is right; it could scarcely have been culpable, since it was his act." So saying, and with an upward glance as of prayer, the scorn slowly left her eyes; the next expression that they wore, as Herbert gazed upon her, was one of the saddest he had ever beheld-looks down-drooped, while the hot tears, which she in vain tried to repress, came welling from be- neath her lids. With his great, all-pervading love, he rose to say to her words which, to make them worthy of her hearing, he had conned over as a lesson, whispering them beneath the mid- night stars, in the sunlight, at home and abroad. Now he felt truly that he could add not only was her hand sacred in his eyes, but likewise were her heart, her hopes, her whole self, body and soul. Ere he spoke, however, Helen had turned away from him, wretched and forlorn, to seek her own apartment, with a wounded spirit which she felt would require days and weeks of circumspect conduct on the part of Herbert Drayton to heal. She was leaving him more in mournfulness than anger, feeling confident that this, his first fault, would surely be his last, when his inten- tion of speaking to her then and there, and her own departure were arrested by the sound of footsteps, both simultaneously awaiting the entrance of him who was approaching the study-room. It was mail day, and the footsteps proved to be only   IELE COURTENAY.       233 those of a servant bringing Helen a letter. Mechanically breaking the seal, she read it where she stood. It was a business letter, nothing more, and yet with a stupid, help- less stare she looked at her companion, grasped a chair to prevent herself from falling; grew pale, then flushed ; tried to take a step forward to leave the room, but failing, sat down despairingly, waiting for her strength to return. That he loved her was Herbert Drayton's only thought; that the contents of that letter annoyed and pained her was  his excuse for being over-bold in offering his aid; not indeed bolder than a man should be, whose hopes tell him that he may be working for the welfare of his future wife. And who that wooes is without hope? "Something annoys you," he said gently; "some one has dared to pain you," he added, glancing at the missive. Helen only looked up to him-without venturing to reply. "You may deem me rude, intrusive, Miss Tracy; I care not; if it is not of a private nature give me that letter, and allow me to help you in your need. Let my larger expe- rience and man's judgment assist you--will you not " Only one word was vouchsafed him in answer, a mono- syllabic "No." "No? Yes, rather," he answered, growing valiant in her cause against an imaginary enemy. "Let me see the con- tents of that offending epistle; that is," he added more gently, " if you are quite willing." "I cannot," she said, shuddering with fear lest she might yield and he so gain a clud to her secret, "When you say, that you cannot," he returned reproach- fully, " you mean that you will not; some danger threatens you, I am sure, but it shall not-shall not fall upon you. I dare command you to place that letter in my hand." Crouching there, frightened, before him, Helen felt in her inmost heart that the man uttering those bold, imperative words was the only one under the wide heavens whom blindly she would have obeyed, and who stood revealed to her as her master and superior; and yet, strange paradox, the thought was sweet. How weak and foolish, then, it was to combat with him in words! She could not, dared not; but crushing the paper in her hand,. hoped that he would     234       HELEN COURTEN. understand the simple pantomime as a conclusive negative, and allow her to pass without further delay from the room. "Then, since I must not see the letter," he continued persistently, " be kind enough to answer me a few questions." His words were pleading, his manner that of a king to his subject. "Does this communication concern you much " "Yes." "Does it make you unhappy?" "No, not exactly; yes." "Does it concern another besides yourself?" "Yes." "Some one whom you love? Some man?" She was silent, deep in thought, the blood rushing to her face and covering it with a radiant blush that felt almost like a thrill of pain. "Some one whom you love?" he repeated again, im- patiently. "Must I answer?" she asked. "I wish it, I require it," he returned in a tone of com- mand. "Yes, or no?" "Yes, yes," she said, shrinking and trembling 'His face grew darker, sterner, his heart forgetting such a thing as pity; he had forgotten even her; himself only he remembered, and the life or death of his cherished hope. "Some one with whom you could be happy for a life- time? I am curious to know." Calmly he spoke, like a man gathering his best energies 'for a final throw in a game of chance; this was at least the outward seeming; beneath lay a vision of ruin, bankruptcy, despair. "Some one by whom you would be glad, above all others, to be called by the dear, sacred name of wife?" Raising her eyes beseechingly to his, she regarded him for a moment as a child might look upon one in whose pre- sence he is helpless, and who with a murderous purpose holds aloft a descending knife ready to strike a vital part; a dumb animal, powerless, pitiful expression; then dropping them suddenly again she extended her arms as though for mercy, and turning towards the door, resolutely prepared for flight.   HELEN CO URTENA Y        235 "Tell me," he said sternly, interpreting her purpose, and planting himself before her, moved by desperate passion, and fear that the word for which he waited might separate her from him for ever, " do you love this man eVen thus?" "Will you take your cruel eyes away from me," she whispered, hiding her face in her hands; " if I tell you,  will you free me from the spell with which you bind me captive here; will you leave me when I say the word?" "Yes; I promise you this." Closer and closer he bent over her, fearing to lose her slightest tone. "One word; only one word. I shall hear it if you but breathe it," he said.  His throbbing heart-beats might have been counted many times ere she answered, but still he waited patiently, gazing upon her with selfish scrutiny, as her marble-white lips, from which the blood had flowed away, framed themselves to reply. Y"Yes," she gaspe4 at last. Then he turned from her and departed, i trembler in his  turn, with a face which seemed death-struck, while she, ' hearing his distant footsteps along the corridor, raised her , head and darted away as though pursued by invisible foes,'  nor rested nor paused until she reached her own room be- K- wildered and faint, and crushing the letter that had so  moved her with a vise-like grasp within her hand. While her eyes are closed, and her head drooping, as though some calamity had befallen her, let us gently, gently force the missive from her, for she needs tenderness, and see, before we condemn her weakness, the contents of the mysterious sheet. They were simply these. After alludingto the prosper- ous state of her property and its steady increase, Stephen Gerald had written: "In accordance with your directions, I forwarded your late remittance to Mobile, in care of the agent who receives the yearly sum. He writes that there is no longer any such individual, to his knowledge, as Edward Lee, that per on having changed his name; in fiture he will receive the stipend under his new cognomen. He is at present in England with the gentleman who has adopted him as his son, both bearing the same name-that of Herbert Drayton."     236       HELEN COURTENA  CHAPTER XVIII. COMMUNITIES, like individuals, are forgetful, and London had ceased to remember the brilliant actress who, not many months in the past, had flashed like a meteor across the theatrical sky and then disappeared. The Strand continued to be as busy a scene as ever; not abating for an instant in its mighty tide of human beings, who paused not to specu- late upon what eccentric orbit she might have described. St. Paul's loomed up in its shadowy grandeur the same as in the hour when her fame was the theme of every tongue, nor cleared away one whit its mist and the dust of ages to gaze with clearer view in search of the missing star. The chil- dren in the parks, living butterflies, stopped not in their sports to bewail a lost plaything of the public, and the aris- tocrats of the West End scarcely sighed before they greeted a new wonder with a smile. Not only had our heroine been forgotten-erased from memory, but her place in the universal heart had been usurped by a songstress, whose witching harmonies, half human, half divine, floated like the perfume of delicious flowers upon the surrounding air. The advent of a celebrity so unrivalled, spread, even across a dividing ocean, from city to city; and the inmates of Greenwood Seat, not free from the common mania of desiring to judge for themselves of the powers of the cantatrice, followed their impulses, and like many another pilgrim to the glittering shrine, found them- selves drawn by the attractive magnet to London. It was Mr. Drayton's wish that Helen should accompany them on their pleasure excursion, for he too fully felt her value in their little circle to desire to lose sight of her, and she was in no way reluctant to accept his kind and cordial invitation. It was true she had the choice of remaining at Greenwood Seat, with every luxury and comfort; but the prospect of lonely hours and days, with no companionship but that of her host's almost imbecile brother, was anything but agreeable to contemplate. Moreover, she felt the need of a change, even if it were not for the better, desiring to be taken away from herself and her almost constant and morbid   HELEN COURTENA Y.        237 retrospection of the incidents of the past few days; for, though calm outwardly, she lived internally an unnatural life of excitement, the leading causes of which may be briefly enumerated. First, the wonderful course of events that had brought Edward Lee and herself under the same roof; his change of name and evident inclination to ignore or conceal the one by wich he had formerly been known; the longing she experienced to question him and others concerning that upon. which they were so silent and uncommunicative; the fear lest in so questioning she might betray her own secret; his sudden alteration of demeanor from friendliness to a liberty she dared not excuse, and, since that day, a distance of manner checking all social intercourse between them, and creating a discordant note in their little circle, which their genial bearing to each other had formerly helped to make so pleasant; and lastly, the confession he had wrung from her, word by word, the memory of which frightened and made her ashamed, fearing he might have seen below the surface, deep down into her heart, and beheld with disgust and dismay her love for him unsought, and his image pictured there. All these considerations preyed upon her with something of the depressing influence of slow fever; most gladly then did she welcome the thought of new scenes that promised to give her a fresh'train of ideas, and, though on a more simple scale than the rest, made her preparations for the journey as if for some important undertaking. But not with the same identity as before could she ex- pect to enter London; a new Sensation had been added to her life-the happy, yet troublesome sense of loving-the source of unutterable joy, yet the fountain of unutterable woe. Not for one moment did Helen imagine that Herbert Drayton would turn from his brilliant pathway to stoop to raise her, an unknown governess, to his level-most assur- edly not, when such a woman as Lilla Bentham thought him worthy of her sphere; and in imagination she ever pictured them as fulfilling together the same bright destiny, feeling that Lilla's heart-worship must at length find an outlet in the glance of her eyes, and that Herbert would some day understand how much he was beloved by the impulsive girl. i        238       HELEN CO URTENA Y. Nor did this view into the future take away from the purity and sanctity of her own emotions; at the present moment, at least, Herbert was free; no one was wronged by the sen- timents with which she regarded him, and to our heroine they were as delicious as they were sacred and rare. "A single glance of genuine affection," so whispered her com- forting conscience, " illumes a lifetime; and though like one wrecked on a desolate island, I stand afar off and see the white sheets of a distant sail, beautiful in the sunlight, bear- ing on its course, approaching not my extended armns, and regardless of my despairing cries praying for its nearer coming, yet for the momentary joy that its transient appear- ance bestows, the rainbow light of hope, let me be thankful, though it passed away from my sight for ever, unconscious of my loneliness and sorrow." Then in that first coming to London she was working as it were in the dark for one whom she had never seen, and in whom she was no wise interested; now, a new impulse was given to her intentions, a fresh resolve to shield her father's memory from obloquy, and to assist another to gain his just deserts. Helen rejoiced, too, that no vulgar spend- thrift, but one so worthy, was to be the holder of her wealth, and she vowed more religiously than ever to keep the secret of her parent's lawless breach of trust from one so keenly alive to what was honorable among mtn. Added to this was the idea, almost ludicrous when viewed in one light, of how little he stood in need of help, and of the necessity of personal economy on her part to meet the yearly required sum; but on the other hand, the young governess found something like fascination in the thought of the mystery that had brought her face to face with the unconscious recipient of her bounty. Only about two years remained before his twenty-eighth year, the period fixed by his father's will for him to receive his inheritance-until then Helen had concluded to continue, if desired, in Mr. Dray- ton's family, where, besides having an ample income, she felt the happy consciousness of being useful; and then, after transferring the property, with Stephen Gerald's assistance, plan other associations in a new sphere of duty. These, and minor points, occupied her thoughts in turn with the   HELEN COURTEA Y.        239 arrangements attendant on her visit to the city; once on the route, she put away from her everything that could mar her 4 perfect enjoyment of the delicious and inspiriting drive. Mr. Drayton and May occupied one carriage; Cornelia, Herbert, and Helen another. It was late spring-time, the wheat-fields spreading like a green carpet over the country; the fruit-trees full leaved, and every acre of ground present- ing a picture of thrift, not unaccompanied by ornament; a union of the useful and beautiful, that in some sense assures the beholder that the plan of the Creator is being fulfilled by the industry of his creatures. At least, so Helen thought, as her eyes wandered over the checkered landscape through the beautiful and cultivated scenes of English husbandry, linking the great metropolis with its unrest, its busy heart-throbs, its ceaseless murmur of voices, with gur- glinghrooks, the song of birds, and Nature's harmonious chorus of sounds. She never remembered so fully to have felt the luxury of pure animal life as upon that day. Memory had been locked away, hope was forgotten; her existence for the moment resembling'more that of the breeze- rocked flower or fluttering bee than a mortal's with a heri- tage of care and disappointment. Every heart has in its keeping thoughts of certain by- gone hours in harmony with existence, running through it like a golden thread through a warp, and never entirely lost sight of; not seasons of active employment, a part played in a brilliant pageant, something striking that we have accom- plished, or what another has done for us, but moments of tranquil pleasure experienced in viewing a certain sunset, a beauteous landscape, a day brighter than other days, a twilight time of pensive retrospection, a midnight vigil of serene trust and hope. Perhaps, on the whole, the outward may have but little agency in the peculiar emotions expe- rienced in such moments, our inward mood giving coloring to our surroundings; and this might have been the reason why Helen remembered that day through a long life of clanges as one on which Nature had whispered secrets into her ear unknown to others, when her soul seemed unbound from some icy thraldom; and when, had she been gifted with wings, she would have soared upwards with a glad sense of     240      HELEN COURTENAY. freedom, following the flight of the birds, who, like herself, were revelling in the beauty of that sunny morn. If there were any check to her full sense of delight, it was in the fact that when turning for sympathy to her com- panions in the exuberance of her spirit, she met Herbert's - eyes gravely, almost reproachfully, fixed upon her; or if he smiled in recognition of some bright sparkle of wit to which she gave utterance, it was not hearty and heartfelt, but as  though he were divesting himself with reluctance of a sad  train of thought, astonished at beholding the gaiety of another when his own soul was shaded with gloom. His uncongeniality, however, did not permanently affect Helen; for her the minutes were winged, everything appearing to her in tune with the voice of Nature. Mr. Drayton treated her with an almost reverential manner, as one to whom he owed the new-found pearl of domestic peace, seeming re- juvenated, and enjoying existence with the heart of youth; May's increasing devotion somewhat repaying him for years of solitariness, and opening to him a vista of a declining life of happiness, while an occasional kind word from Cornelia surprised him into feeling an emotion of positive pleasure. Added to this encouraging state of affairs, which Helen could so surely trace to herself, Cornelia and May were most gracious to their young governess, partly because she had won a claim to their consideration by her strength of cha- racter and invaluable instructions, but chiefly because they, too, after months of seclusion, were about to partake once more of the excitements of a city life. Arrived at their destination, and in the luxurious hotel in which Mr. Drayton installed them, Helen, when she found herself alone, could not refrain from musing awhile upon the chances and changes of human life, especially those con- nected with herself, comparing the Lovells' lowly home with the almost regal pile now her abode, and doubting, so dif- ferent were her present circumstances, whether she had really breathed that veritable London air before. The retrospec- tion carried her back to her once friendless self, soon finding friends in Annie Lovell and kind Mr. Bland. Of these and other things she thought briefly-Belle Burton's misguided conduct, the happy bridal, her bewildering theatrical expe-   HELEN CO URTEENA Y       241 rience, the hateful reminiscence clinging around a certain network of pearls, her sudden flight, her refuge with Julia Dearing, and the solemn and impressive death of her friend. These occurrences clung to her like the shadowy scenes of a dream, while far above each and all a deep-toned bell, pealing out from a myriad of minor chimes, vibrated the voice of the noble and constant physician, uttering words of impassioned love, and offering her a refuge, safe and sure, from the storms and cheating hopes of life. Once she had been willing to accept his offer, telling him so in plainest terms; but reading her better than she read herself, he had generously put the proffered gift away. Would, she be willing to make the same sacrifice now? asked the watchful monitor in her soul. The blood mounted in a turbulent flow up to her very brow. "No," said every thinking and reasoning principle within her. "And why?" Deeper and redder the hot tide flowed; more quickly pulsated her fast-beating heart. There was a reason; could it be outspoken? Never! Her duty was to keep guard over her bosom, where it lay locked from view, so that others might not detect how quietly and at home it nestled there, influencing her words and acts, and coloring every thought of every day. Twice this mysterious power had overcome her-twice gained the mastery, once in the study- room at Greenwood Seat, and now again. Asleep, it was harmless; known only to herself. it was a mentor urging her to all noble achievements, this new passion, this secret joy. But did not the vigilant guard required to keep it in subjection prove it to be dangerous? Ought she-to allow it to enchain her as at present? Under some circumstances would it not be to sin? Then the naked truth flashed upon her-she was loving, unloved, some one who might love another, some one who did not love her; a thing innocent in itself, but how long would it continue so? Might she not be laying the foundation of her own future misery, perhaps that of others? It was sweet, but was it wise? Helen boasted an iron resolution-: "No; I must live it down," she said aloud, in concluding her reverie; "I must free my- self from this delicious yet tyrant thrall-- will." r .  "     242       HELEN C O URTENAY. So have others resolved with as unsuccessful results; so will human nature plan and fail until the end of time, at least in regard to determinations where the affections are implicated. To make and keep a vow where principle simply is concerned is comparatively easy, but let passion intrude, with its almost resistless force, and the effort is nearly superhuman--the victory worthy of an angel. When Helen took upon hesclf the fulfilment of her dying father's desires, duty and parental regard alone were her incentives to right action; to combat against the emotion of love, ex- perienced in its full strength in such a nature as hers, was a task the length and breadth of which she had not calculated. Rejoiningl her companions, she heard with a sense of relief from Mr. Drayton that Dr. Percival was absent from London, for she dreaded to meet his questioning glances, and feared that his profound knowledge of human nature would enable him to detect the new secret she bore in her breast, and from which, when he had last seen her, she was free. And yet, at times, she could not but regret his departure, as only through him, knowing what he did of her past life, could an opportunity be offered of visiting her old homes-her faith- ful Mary and her friend Annie once more. These regrets, however, were soon lost sight of in the excitement of the great metropolis, every day having its hours devoted to sight-seeing, leaving but little room in our heroine's mind for any thought save her. new experiences, and the kind friends to whom she was indebted for entertainment so' rich and varied.  As it had been impossible for Mr. Drayton to obtain seats at the opera house until the last night of the canta- trice's appearance, the party from Greenwood Seat remained for a longer period of time than was at first anticipated in London, much to the satisfaction of all it included, and especially so to our young heroine, who, besides beholding what could not fail to interest a mind so cultivated as her own, had the additional satisfaction of possessing the entire sympathy, that chief requisite in the enjoyment of life, of at least one of her companions. She dared not acknowledge even to herself the blank created by the occasional absence of Herbert Drayton; in his presence what was beautiful in   HELEN COURTENA         243 art or nature appeared doubly attractive, historic associa- tions more vivid a4d! interesting, while even paintings seemed hung in more favorable lights when he was near with his unerring taste to point out their beauties. There was also to Herbert an inexplicable fascination in the thought that Helen always appealed to his judgment, or asked for instruction from him upon the loftiest or most triviaub- jects; and though, when alone i the silence of the niht, he grieved over his infatuation, making a resolve to avoid the cheating light which could not but allure him onward into the precincts of a dangerous morass, still when the morning came he was ready and eager as ever to follow her bidding, and to be beguiled by that bewitching smile--that smile, which she had told him in language as plain as speech could  make it, belonged to one to whom her whole heart belonged. Many of Herrbert's hours were necessarily spent in the society of his scientific friends, who were most urgent in their claims upon him, the busy tongue of rumor at once proclaiming his presence in the city; while calls, iuvitations, and attentions from men of rank and position demanded a large portion of his time. But all these could not, and would not, be allowed by him to interfere with that other pleasure, predri far more in his estimation--the companion- ship of Helen Tracy. With her he sought the creations of the immortal artists of the past, sauntered amid the laby- rinths of the Tower of London, admired the grand propor- tions of St. Paul's Cathedral, or walked his companion by his side and in his heart, amid the beauties of the tree- dotted parks, that gleamed in the midst of the busy, noisy metropolis like patches of bright blue sky among the clouds of the stormy heavens. Then, together they visited the hallowed ground of West- minster Abbey, filled alike with the same reverential thoughts of the silent inhabitants beneath, while they needed no medium  of speech to te that they understood eah other, or depended upon w9rds as a means of communica.. tion from soul to soul. T ether they sought the monu- ments of the great of past as, thrilling in unison at some remembered word of fire breathed by lips now hushed; or wandered to the records of the high-born. t place of     244       HELENS CO URTENAY. sepulture of Scotland's Mary, where they mused on her mysterious career; then to the tomb of the virgin Queen, God and man-favored in life, yet wretched and lonely in death; or, within the sombre shade of Edward the Confes- sor's chapel, silently asked in its solemn, prayer-inspiring precincts for faith and trust. Next, when weary of reading the achievements of men of war, heroes whose epitaphs are not alone written upon marble or granite, but upon the hearts of the people, and in the mystic volume of tradition, while Mr. Drayton and his daughters lingered among the proud tombs of such as these, Herbert and Helen turned with a common impulse towards the shaded resting-place of the genius-crowned dead. Here Herbert found a voice; here he needed something more than his companion's silent sympathy as a remembrance of that sad yet joyous, mournful yet delicious day spent in her charmed presence. He talked with her of Milton's grand numbers, notes struck from a lyre whose solemn tones would reverberate through the ages; of Spenser and his gentle Una, and of all women he had ever seen, Helen, he said, most resembled her, walking alone and unharmed through the world, the armor of purity and truth her only defence, until at length they paused before the monument of a mightier genius than each and all-Helen's well-beloved Shakspeare. Gazing upon it, her eyes filled with the light of gratitude as she thought of the pleasant hours he had given her, of his com- panionship in solitude, of the holiday-time passed with him in childhood, of her better appreciation of him in woman- hood; and thus thinking, thus grateful, forgetful of the presence of another, her self-commune clothed itself in his own imperishable words, while in low tones of impassioned enunciation she uttered them: "The cloud capped towers, the gorgeous palaces, The solemn temples, the great globe itself, Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve, And, like this unsubstantial pageant faded, Leave not a rack behind." "Yes," she continued in the same impressive accents, " all   HELEN COURTENAY.        245 this shall be. Until then, until memory itself shall be no more, will reverence and homage and affection be laid upon the shrine."          r When Helen first began her apostrophe to one whose genius she so prized, Herbert listened with rapt attention to her perfect elocution, which he could have heard with un- tiring patience for hours, so musical was her voice; but soon a feeling of jealousy, as unaccountable as it was unreason- able, superseded all other feelings, and impulsively turning towards her, he gave utterance to his thoughts in a quick and impatient questioning. "If you place-himn so high in your estimation," he said, pointing to the poet's tomb, "where do you class your loves? Above or below your laurel-crowned bard?" A bright blush flitted over Helen's pale face, and she turned away without answering; but Herbert's repetition of the inquiry left her no choice but to reply. "I have no loves," she' answered, her lustrous eyes veiled with their jetty fringe, clouds curtaining the brilliant sun- light; so thought Herbert, daring to gaze upon her down- drooped lids. "Your love then, rather," he answered, with some fierce- ness in his tone; "you acknowledged not long since that you did love truly, passionately; in short, you confessed to a life-affection fixed, unchanging." "You must forget that day, that hour," she answered quickly. "Can you not, will you not?" "Oh, of course," he replied sarcastically, ' nothing in the world could be more easy; or, if you choose, you can take your words back, unsay them, forget them yourself; worn are privileged, Janus-faced, Janus-hearted, turning to e- holders the side most politic to display. You are fortunate, Miss Tracy, in having such wonderful self-control as to cease to remember when it is convenient for you to do so." "I did not mean that," said Helen solemnly, and raising her truthful eyes for a moment to his; "believe me, it is not so easy to forget; but if prayers and hopes, and a con- tinual watch over self-will, serve the purpose of enabling me to live down an emotion, which, in a weak moment, I con- fessed to you was the paramount feeling of my being, some-'     246       HELEN CO URTENA Y. thing neither wise nor right, something which, even if I struggle for months or years, I must and will conquer, then will I pray and hope untiringly until the end." To Herbert -this new confession was not less wild and strange than the first he had so cruelly forced from her, but with this difference: then, in the other, she had left him without hope; now'her words gave him a dawn of en- couracement, though scarcely perceptible in the far future; and with the Utopian resolve of-- awaiting so problematic a result as she had foretold, with a blind confidence he rocked his doubts and fears to sleep. The unknown rival once forgotten, his image and influence discarded, could he not with delicacy urge upon her his claims to her favor, his enduring love, his constancy througfh time and eternity? With the fervor of a first, all only, a lasting passion, he answered in his own mind the question he had proposed to himself. "Yes, 1 will patiently await the end of the struggle of months or years, and ask then for what it will be hers to give-her heart, herself." With far more gentleness in his accents than when he had last spoken, and with a more worthy motive than mere curi- osity, he again questioned Helen, though in a different form from his first interrogatory: "When a true woman loves, where does she place him whom she loves?" The answer required, being no longer personal, but ab- stract, caused Helen one momlllet's concentrated thought; then losing sight of the present, and of the companionship in which she stood, inainining only a possible case of loving and being beloved in full mneasure, her cheek glowed as she r ied in earnest accents that carried conviction with them, and brought a yearning desire in the breast of her listener to be the object of affection so devoted: "Shle would not kneel to him in adoration, that only be- longs to the Creator; nor would she stand afar off as in the presence of this great master-mind, and reverentially look upo I him as her poet-kinrg; but she would give her whole bein-r into his keeping, including her duty to the Deity and lier admiration for the genius that he has made; and while her heart beat alone for him, taking naught away from God or from God's creation, she would expect him, having her   HELEN COURTENA Y.        247 whole self in trust, to have a care that she worships Heavenr not too feebly, or bestows upon the things of earth reverence due only to her Maker and her Judge." "In other words," said Herbert, breaking the brief silence that succeeded, and pointing to the effigy of Milton's calm and angelic countenance, where the fire of poesy contended with a divine faith, " you would have woman repeat his sub- lime stereotyped utterance:  X      / "' He for God only, she for God in him.' '"  "How provoking to have forgotten that; I -might have remembered it with a little forethought," she answered. "How much my poor words must have marred his noble utterance when you compared them. After all, theI only things mankind can now write or speak must be a repetition of what has gone before--the writings and sayings of other men. Truly there is nothing new under the sun; our best thoughts are not original, but borrowed, and mutilated in the expression. Why did you not interrupt me with quoting that line which expresses so much more than my many words? Yes, truly, it is my ideal of the place intended to be occupied by man and woman: ' "He for God only, she for God in him.'" Helen's countenance, while she echoed these words, was turned towards Herbert, all beaming with the picture she had painted of domestic love and truth; in beholding her, a realization of his best and brightest dream of happiness, Herbert could not resist the temptation of letting his eyes rest upon her for an instant in a glance of passionate a ffec- tion. The look so intense, so natural, a reflex of what was passing in his heart, could not fail to arrest Helen's atten- tion, who questioned herself as to what it meant, and from what fountain it had its flow. With a sense of delight, an emotion of joy unknown,- unfelt before, she recognised in it a spark of the same fire burning in her own breast; earth could give her nothing better, nothing more to be desired- she was full satisfied; without a spoken syllable she knew that she was beloved.  Had a hundred eyes been upon her, she would have cared to fathom the meaning of his alone. Then no longer did she chide herself for cherishing an un- -     248      UHELEN COURTENA Y. returned passion. Life, the present and future, were gold- tinted, and she basked in the blessed light. But even while revelling in the new-found bliss, and treading the pathway to an opening heaven, the prospect darkened, the shadows came thick and fast, the vision faded into nothingness; and quenching the answering torchght which she felt flushing her face with a radiant glow, stood passive and motionless, listening mechanically to her companion's words, and hug- ging her secret closer and closer within her breast. "And sometimes how unworthily," said Herbert, recover- ing his momentarily lost self-command, and replying in some sort to Helen's last remark, "are these grand thoughts of great men repeated; I mean from what unworthy lips they often proceed. Think what corrupt portals open at times that they may issue forth; for instance, your idol Shakspeare's wondrous wisdom, spoken as lessons by men and women, all unfit for the office they undertake-actors, whose lives are often notoriously immoral; actresses, whose very existence taints the atmosphere they breathe. Let vice hide itself, like all dark, poisonous things; it is mockery to hear pure truths coming from painted lips and blackened hearts, to see such as these set up before the people as moral- ists and educators. Cover the life of an actress, as the stage now stands, with flowers, crown her with laurel leaves, let her whose profession it is be as pure as new-fallen snow, the fever-spot is upon her notwithstanding all; she is one in the great School for Scandalthe theatre represents; the diamond is marred by the rubbish surrounding it. She cannot select her fellow-performers; the embrace of a dissipated Romeo takes away something of the guilelessness of an innocent Juliet; her affectionate and devoted nurse may be sullied by a hundred vices; a Lady Macbeth, knowing nothing of the bad passions of the world except through her own imper- sonations, looks with tenderest gaze upon her lord, whose answering glance may have its origin in an unholy thought, quite foreign to the part he plays. Yes, let that green cur- tain drop between a pure woman and the sanctity of her home, and she loses a part of her purity. Take her from the stage, immure her in the walls of a convent, veil her form and heart with the dress of a novice, she is the actress   HELEN COU0RTENA .        249 still. My words are strong, Miss Tracy, too strong, per- haps, for your ears; I may be over-fastidious; I must be, since so many take a different ground from myself; but to me the profession tells of two lives-a dual intermixture of seeming and being, a day life and a night life, something . upon which the full light of God's favor can never shine. Let a woman but once tread the boards of a theatre and she separates herself from my world, as far as Hades from heaven. Such is my estimation of an actress." "Ah!" It was all that she said in answer, softly and mournfully, a sigh rather than a word; pressing her hand, the while, upon her heart, where the arrow had fallen quivering, prob- ing and lacerating the wounded part. In the early morning of that day, Herbert had bestowed upon Helen and the sisters a gift of flowers. Selecting a single cluster from those which had fallen to the share of the former, he had retained it through the day, now holding it caressingly and inhaling its delicate perfume, or admiring its exquisite leaves with the eye of a botanist who discovers more beauty in God's handiwork than a common observer. Helen had noticed this gentle treatment of the Oconscious blossom; but alas! she saw also that in uttering that last word, the thing he so despised, he seemed to invest the fragrant bloom with some of the qualities of that which he condemned, and Impulsively casting it from him, as they walked onward, trampled it under his feet. Then she shud- dered like a sensitive plant shrinkingofrom a rude touch, grew pallid and cold, experiencing a dreary sense of being quite forsaken, a stupid recognition of his words with no power to argue, or combat with him, or to try to change his cruel opinion; and while feeling thus utterly desolate, they joined the rest and took their homeward way. For him the skies were brighter, the air more balmy, while he entertained a deep, increasing love for one who in his imagination seemed to answer responsively to all his needs, his modes of thinking, his aspirations; in whose presence he could set aside conventionalisms and converse freely and without blame; in a word, who understood him, as if God had sent her to fill up the whole of an individual existence "*     2o0       HTELENr COURTEnMA Y. whose half he himself represented; for her, the blackness of darkness, a gloomy sky, the doom of silence, the chance ar- row that he had sped still rankling in her throbbing breast. The Maker was merciful when He planned the seat of our deepest pains to be invisible; no canker-sore points to the place, no welling blood tells of a wound. We draw a gorgeous curtain over the plague spot, our brilliant smiles; we hang a silver veil over the festering flesh, our merry speech; and the world looks upon us, and recks not of the ruin beneath. CHAPTER XIX. IT was with a mysterious and dream-like feeling that Helen found herself in the evening at the opera-house, a spectator, when, in a scene so similar, she had been an actor. Though her eyes saw, and her ears heard, all was vague, unreal, unsubstantial: and it was not until she was addressed by a familiar voice that the spirit-spell was broken, and her seemingly lost senses returned in full power. Called to the present scenes by those well remembered tones, she no longer appeared to herself to be floating midway in the air; one hand resting upon the other, no more seemed to be a dead weight; her footing became firm again; the memory of who and what she was returned to her; while she awoke with a start from the world of dreams, and experienced the strong pulsations of breathing, active life. "Are you well, are you happy?" said the voice close to her ear; " are you contented .?" Holding out her hand, Helen greeted the new-comer with honest gladness; he had been her friend in the past; in his earnest questioning she read that he would befriend her still; and she was rejoiced to see him, forgetting the embarrassing circumstances that had once marked their intercourse, and feeling entirely at her ease in his society, because know- ing in her inmost soul that he, unlike others, would not shrink from her as one unworthy of a place in his regard. "Three questions to be answered in a breath," she re- plied, smiling a welcome, and in a tone as low as his own.   HrELEN COCUR TENAY.       2S51 ("-I will begin with the last. I am contented; they are so kind, and I thank you for choosing so wisely for me. It was hard at first, but it is easy now. Am I happy? Yes; no. This is the only manner in which mortals can answer such a query, for neither happiness nor misery is abiding; nothing lasts; time, like a gulf, sweeps away in turn sorrow and joy. As for being well, look at me, and take my answer from my outward self. Appearing well is almost being well. Let the hospitalities of Greenwood Seat speak for them- selves. Am I looking well " Though the interrogation was made without the slight- est shade of coquetry, and as carelessly as if addressed to a brother after a long parting, it was a dangerous one, nevertheless, and Helen soon found it to be so. Thus chal- lenged, Dr. Percival raised his eyes deliberately to her face and surveyed, her curiously, fixedly, until the hot blood mounted to her brow; while, with downcast eyes, she im- patiently awaited his decision, not imagining that he would have taken her words so literally. And when, at last, he did reply, her blushes grew deeper as he spoke. "As well, as strangely fascinating, as lovable," he said, "as when I first and last beheld you, only with this differ- ence: then you were like a caged bird, beating against the bars of a prison; in other words, battling with circum- stances in a life foreign to you. Now, though the same bird, you are infinitely more brilliant, revelling in your freedom, with your heart, I know, bounding with healthier action. God forbid," he added, betrayed by her unguarded ques- tion into words he had neither expected to say nor she to hear, "that I should hold you prisoner against your will; but were you to surrender yourself captive, as once you did, I am afraid that I should never, never let you go. Could you, would you, now as then?" "Hush," she said softly, her expression changing from that of joy to trouble; "you forget your promise. You wound me when you speak thus; you cease to befriend me-and, truly, I have no real friend but you." "God bless, you for the word," he answered; "forgive me for this, and I will not offend -you again. I have spoken to you my last syllable of love."     252       HELEN COURTENAY lAK For an instant he bowed his head, perchance strengthen- ing his vow by prayer; then, shaking off his sad mood, discoursed with Helen, between the acts, upon ordinary topics of conversation, and the merit of the performance; while she, feeling entirely at home with him when he ap- peared only as a friend, became unusually animated in look and speech. In answer to her inquiries concerning her old friends, he informed her that Miss Dearing and Mary formed a part of his household; and, though he seldom saw them, their united efforts resulted in bringing to him more comfort in his bachelor establishment than he had ever had there before, and that it would be best, since Helen took her de- parture on the morrow, not to enlighten Mary as to her visit to London. Of Annie Lovell, he informed her he had entirely lost all knowledge, since her removal into the coun- try for'a permanent residence. Lastly, with'a grave look of interest, such as a father might bestow upon a child, the certain evidence of a hard struggle and its reward, self- conquest, Dr. Percival again renewed his offer of assistance to Helen; his counsel, should she be in want of it; his home, should she ever find herself homeless and deserted. In the meantime, though their conversation could not be overheard, Helen and Dr. Percival, unconsciously to them- selves, were watched by others. Among these were Mr. Drayton, who augured from Helen's apparent pleasure in his friend's society, a dawn of hope for the disappointed suitor; and, secondly, by Herbert, who, in moody silence, furtively regarded them, fearing that the man whose pre- sence flushed the cheek of his companion with a glow so brilliant, whose society seemed to give her so much satis- faction, and whose nobility of appearance he could not deny, was he from whose influence she found it so hard to free herself; and who, spite of all her efforts to the contra- ry, might retain her love. This feeling of unrest was aug- mented, too, when he reflected that in the few hours inter- vening between that time and their morning walk,. Helen had studiously avoided him, giving brief answers to his questions, and making some trivial excuse, which denied him the privilege of a seat next her at the opera; but, on the whole, he blamed himself for harboring so unpleasant   HELEN COURTENAY.        253 a reflection, attributing her apparent coldness to accident, and thanking God that his surmise about Dr. Percival was only problematic. Still, he could not behold this warmly- welcomed acquaintance, with his face close to hers, whis- pering in her ear, his eyes bent earnestly upon her, and an unmistakable look of love beaming from them, without a fierce pang of jealousy, an almost irrepressible impulse to tear her from his side. It was to him a terrible hour of suffering, greater than any bodily pain he had before expe- rienced, deeper than any mental struggle that had ever come to him; and, though he tried to dismiss the thought of agony, like a revolving wheel, it turned again and again, renewing in endless circles the same ever-abiding torment. And yet other eyes were upon our heroine, though so busily engaged that she saw them not. A gentleman, an old friend of the Draytons, having joined their party, was in conversation with Cornelia, but while so engaged, was staring-it could be called by no milder name-at Helen, ,apparently making a study of her face and. form. "She is very quiet in her demeanor," he remarked to Cornelia, after asking her name, and learning her position in the Drayton family; "and there is an inborn refinement in her every movement. How faultless is her profile, how classic the arrangement of her glossy hair; and then, from a glimpse I obtained, of them, what glorious eyes she has, beaming with soul and intelligence,' with that mournful expression which is the crown of perfect beauty. I have never seen but one pair resembling them in my life, and they linger in my memory like the vivid dream of a tropi- cal night. I saw them but twice, when, unconsciously to themselves, they laid siege to my heart-and not only to mine, but to a host of other worshippers at the shrine of one who possessed so powerful a magnet of attraction. We were quite ready to kneel at her feet and offer her our allegiance, whenhe abruptly took flight, and we lost her for ever." "You excite my curiosity in a great degree," said Corne- lia. "If the eyes have a history, do let me hear it, and if they are linked with a mystery, so much the better; that, you know, is the chief point of attraction in story-telling."     254       HELEN COUR TE A Y.  "Then, most assuredly," he returned, " mine will interest you, for it is all a mystery. Some months ago a young    1 girl made her debut at one of the leading theatres in London. To say that youth and age appreciated her talents, and that she turned all hearts towards her, would be faint praise and  tame words where Ida Clayborne is concerned. In the imper- sonation of Lady Macbeth, that most difficult of stage con- ceptions, she was unrivalled, managing air, gait, voice, and  expression, as though the character she represented was a reality, not a mere puppet created by a genius to entertain  the public; and in the playful comedy of the Honeymoon,  the most rigid critic could desire no better portraiture of  the versatile Juliana. I mention these characters because  they were all that she undertook. Only two nights did she appear, and then, as I have told you, unaccountably dis- appeared. The manager stormed and secretly explored the city to no purpose; but after vain attempts to discover her retreat, concluded that she had left London, and consoled himself and a fickle public by advertising a new star, wisely concluding that it was most politic to keep his failure as  quiet as possible, which will account for the whole affair not being known to you at Greenwood Seat."  "I remember seeing notices of a coming prodigy of that name in the papers," interrupted Cornelia; "but concluded,  as no further mention was made of this Ida Clayborne, that  I her talents had been over-estimated by the too sanguine  manager." "On the contrary," returned her companion, " if any- thing, they were under-estimated. The young actress was perfection. But to continue my story; numerous specula- tions were rife concerning the bewitching debutante, the majority of which were not all to her credit, being mixed up with the name of a nobleman of high rank, one who pro- tected her from the rather boisterous demonstrations of her admirers, and whom she allowed to escort her home when they would have dragged her carriage in triumph through the streets. To these tales, however, I, for one, never gave the slightest credence, preferring to have the whole thing deliciously savoring of the marvellous, especially since purity seemed to be the birthright of this beautiful queen of the   HELEN COURTENA Y        255 drama. By heavens!" he exclaimed suddenly, in a whisper to Cornelia, as Helen innocently turned her full face towards them, "she is our veritable Star; I could swear it; our fascinating, lost actress."  "Hush, hush," said Cornelia impressively, and with a shade of anxiety in her manner; "promise me that you will not mention your conviction or your surmises to any one, for, of course, they must be but surmises, and I will promise you in return to do all I can to discover Miss Tracy's ante- cedents prior to our employing her at Greenwood Seat. If desirous of obscurity, and she evidently seems to prefer it by remaining so quietly with us, it would be unkind of you if she has been an actress, to bruit about her identity and whereabouts." Cornelia spoke so earnestly that the promise was given. The curtain rose once more, and each and all were absorbed in the performance. The brilliant prima-donna played her part, bowed and smiled amid showers of bouquets, and then the drop-scene said that the pageant was over. Miss Dray- ton s companion left her to join other friends, and' our party, including Dr. Percival, who had constituted himself Helen's escort, proceeded at once to find their carriages. While waiting near the entrance until the crowd should disperse, Helen heard I Drayton make an exclamation of pleased surprise at the recognition of an individual passing out with the rest, and who at once hurried to the spot where they stood, which was somewhat apart from the throng. fMeeting this new-comer evidently gave great pleasure to Cornelia, May, and Mr. Drayton; but Helen it filled with alarm and trembling. Drawing her hood more closely about her face to avoid being observed, and cautiously glancing towards him to be sure that he was indeed one whom she dreaded to see, her worst fears were confirmed by a closer inspection, together with the tones of his voice, while he answered Mr. Drayton's numerous questions as to his fortune since last they had met. He had improved much since Helen, almost his affianced bride, parted with him; having grown taller, broader, browner; his curling locks were of a darker hue, but his     256       HELEN CO URTENAY. blue eyes shone with the same almost womanly tenderness as they did in the days of the long-ago when melting in pity at some tale of sadness and wrong. Yes, it was but too true; standing before her in the pride of manhood was her once boy-lover--Helen's Cousin Frank.  Our heroine found herself listening with intense interest to his communications, as indeed they all did; there was something so fresh, genial, and attractive in his manner, that his most simple word was clothed with a value far beyond its real worth. "Yes, I am bound homeward, after a tedious cruise," he said, in answer to Mr. Drayton. "For the sake of a slight service, a very slight service," he continued, blushing like a girl, "they have granted me leave of absence, after the ex- piration of which, I think I shall bid 'good-by' to the navy. I wish that I had known of your presence at the opera to-night; what a delightful evening I should have passed-a repetition of certain charming hours spent in Paris before I joined my ship in the Mediterranean, and shrined for ever in my heart of hearts!" "We all remember them," returned Cornelia; "father, May, and I. Were we not happy there? One lives in Paris. Grand as it is to be at the castle-home we told you of, in its quiet splendor, the mind stagnates-only the body grows. Miss Tracy alone keeps us alive." This informal mention of her name gave Helen new cause for uneasiness, fearing that an introduction would fol- low Cornelia's somewhat flattering notice of her governess; but she might have spared herself all anxiety, for Frank, full of himself and his new-found friends, scarcely noticed the mention of one who was an entire stranger. "Have not you forgotten them-has not she?" he asked, eagerly, and with a lingering glance at May. "Oh, that time were like books or jewelry-something tangible, that we could put away and then take out to enjoy again! What a paradise life would be! Then we should not have to mourn over pleasures for ever departed!" "Why say for ever departed?" asked Mr. Drayton. "Are we never to see you again? Is the homeward voyage to end your life "   HELEN- COURTENA I Y.      25' "In a measure, yes," he said, with a sigh; "at least, my life of freedom. I have heard casually of the death of my uncle, since I came to London. A duty awaits me in America; and I go, like a good and obedient boy, to per-  form it."    -  "Perhaps our young friend contemplates a death matri-?- menial," said Mr. Draytdn. "I protest that I have given you no reason for coming to that conclusion," he answered, laughing, yet looking un- easily towards May.; "but I am keeping you and your party," he added, glancing around the little circle, while Helen bent still lower, and hung more heavily upon Dr. Percival's arm. "Good-night and good-by!" Holding out his hand to Mr. Drayton, his imanly voice trembled, and something like a tear glistened in his eyes. "And I protest against this," answered Mr. Drayton. "We must not, will not say good-by, here. To-morrow, unfortunately, our plans are arranged for a return to Green- wood Seat; but, on the whole, it is most fortunate. Come with us, and let us have a week of your cheerful, cheering company, before we lose you for ever. Will you come?" Irresolutely gazing upon oneLand then another of his friends, Frank's inclination said, "Go," while duty, his better judgment, and the memory 6f a certain vow, made in other lands, said, "Go not." During that brief time of indecision, Helen's heart was beating in almost audible throbs, while she awaited the issue, as though life or death depended upon the next spoken word; and, though shrouding herself still more completely from view, her ear was ready to catch the faint- est sound of a refusal or acceptance of the invitation ex- tended. "Shall I go or stay?" he asked, helpless to decide for himself, and looking at Cornelia and May. "Go," said Cornelia; "go with us to Greenwood Seat." "Go," echoed May, in a whisper, almost inarticulate, but which struck upon the questioner's ear like a clarion-note of joy. As he heard it, his eyes grew brighter, his pulse throbbed with a quick bound of pleasure, and he promised, not that he would accompany them, because he had to     258       HELEN COUR TENA Y. arrange some business matters in London that could not be delayed, but that he would "join them in a few days, with some such anticipations of delight," he added, laugh- ingly, "as Adam experienced when he thought of regain- ing Eden." "Am I forgotten so soon!" thought Helen, as she looked upon his joyous face, and heard his merry laugh; that laugh which was as contagious as it was musical, and which, in unison with May's, made a duet of glad sounds. For a moment she felt a pang of jealousy; for he was some one to be proud of, as he stood there, tall, manly, and striking- ly handsome; but even at the very instant, as her glance wandered from him to Herbert, though the latter and her- self were severed by his own words, as far as "Hades from Heaven," still she experienced a sense of relief that Frank had ceased to remember her, and that they were not bound by an indissoluble bond. To be obliged to dwell for ever in the companionship of the one was, to her mind, like an eternal sunshine, almost blinding with excess of light, when she panted and longed for the calm shade, the still retreat, the lulling sound of forest streams. Was the other, Herbert, a type of these'last? Crushing the suggestion, as one would quench a forbidden thought, she mechanically bowed to Frank's parting salutation, as he left the Draytons, with the reiterated promise of seeing them soon again. And so they parted; he with a joyful dream of coming delight, and Mr. Drayton with a happy thought of promise of his genial society; for, by that unaccountable proclivity we sometimes have to like our opposites, he was attracted to Frank, finding a refreshment in his yielding, mirthful na- ture that he rarely experienced, because so seldom unbending from his own reserve. Herbert, likewise, looked forward with pleasurable emotions to an occasional hour passed with the warm-hearted stranger, who had won his regard at this, their first meeting; while Cornelia was satisfied at securing for Greenwood Seat a guest so companionable. And lastly, May was thrilled with a secret joy at the idea of those future days, spent with one whom, as she confessed to herself, to have seen once was to remember always. But to Helen, Frank Stoddard's coming brought nothing   HELEYN COlRTtA r-'       259 but a sense of pain, a new source of anxiety added to her weight of troubles. Now, by turns, she laid some plan to avoid him, or to pretend ignorance of his identity, or medi- tated, in a cowardly spirit, a sudden flight, until a sleepless night broke into day-dawning. Still undecided, with a be- wildered mind and restless spirit, she found herself on the road to Greenwood Seat, the wound inflicted by Herbert throbbing with fresh agony, and a shadow deeper than when she had taken that route before hanging over her soul, because unequal to the exigence which her cousin's appearance had so suddenly created, and which rose like' a mountain in her path. ---'-- - CHAPTER XX. THE summer days were glorious at the Draytons' castle home. Could peace have been bought anywhere beneath the sun, a power invoked for outward influences best calcu- lated to act beneficially upon al disturbed mind, it must have been there, where skies, trees, fields, and flowers made a harmony of sights, lulling enough to have hushed the sorrowful, or tried, or tempted soul to rest. But vainly did Helen court the sweet scenes of nature ; it appeared not to be her destiny to enjoy the security of a life of unbroken calm; and pleadingfor counsel from earth, air, and heaven, in her new and unforeseen trial, was equally futile. At best, all the results accruing from her labored thinking were simply suggestions, rejected as soon as they were presented to her. To tell a part of the truth to Frank Stoddard, would have been almost like telling him the whole, for, as her only relative, he would have had a right to weigh her motives, to inquire into her actions, to endeavor to trace back the reasons for those actions to their very root. To have ignored all knowledge of him would have brought upon herself, perchance, unwelcome and awkward moments of scrutiny, ending in a recognition of her iden- tity, with a long train of inconveniences and forced explana-     260       HELEN COURTENA Y tions. Sometimes she thought of feigning sickness, and keeping her own apartment during his stay, but this in- volved deceit and the penance of confinement, hard for her to contemplate with patience during those golden hours. Moreover, it was not extravagant to imagine that her cousin's contemplated visit of a few days might be inter- minably lengthened among his appreciated and appreciating friends, and in that case her imaginary illness, from the want of fresh air, would terminate in real indisposition. Or, granting that this self-immolation were practicable, this assumption of disease, when her blood never coursed with healthier action nor tingled with such a sense of life in her veins, would it not, she argued, be impossible to de- ceive Cornelia and May, whom she would be obliged to admit to her presence as kind nurses or sympathizing friends, or to refuse the attendance of a physician! True it was, that in the last extremity she might break the en- gagement entered into with Mr. Drayton, and fly the con- flict awaiting her-but whither? And would he consent to receive her back again, after a season of absence, should she be inclined to return? Her reason plainly answered, no. What could be done then, what ought to be done? Helen grew restless and impatient under this vacillating state of mind, so foreign to her usual decision of character. Nature no longer ministered to her as a comforter, and she stretched out her appealing hands for help, in vain. The attitude of everything inanimate was that of taunting her with inconstancy of purpose; the broad oaks, under which she now took her solitary evening walks, to her excited imagi- nation, spread their branches towards her as though pointing her out as fickle and weak; the sombre yews, in their turn, closed their boughs around her, as if to screen one so changeable from human sight; the solemn arcades of an- cient firs, amid whose shade she once wandered with light heart and tripping feet, reminded her that their gloomy retreat was but typical of the darkness reigning within her own beclouded soul. Once Helen's favorite seat in her own apartment, had been at a window overlooking an artificial lake that lay close to Herbert's laboratory. This, perchance, she had sought, remembering that he, too, watched the   HELEN COURTENA Y.        261 evening shadows stealing over the earth, and the rooks trooping homeward at twilight to their nests, and cawing in almost intelligible language the result of their day's jour- ney; now, the shadows fell not only on the placid waters, but upon her desponding heart, and, the social cry of the busy birds sounded like weird and accusing voices of anger and reproach. Unfortunately, there were not many outward circum- stances to take Helen, as it were, from herself, the usual routine of teaching affording,but little variety, Herbert be- ing absent on a visit to some friends, while Lilla no longer cantered over to Greenwood Seat at mid-day, to join the German recitation. The young heir having returned with a host of gay companions, noble lordsaand titled ladies, she was kept at home to entertain them; and though soon after the return of the Draytons from London, she had invited them to take lunch at Balthorp, and to accompany her and her guests on an equestrian expedition, a rain-storm had in- terrupted the promised pleasure. Had they gone as antici- pated, perhaps without much trouble, they would have dis- covered why Lilla, launched on the sea of society, petted, caressed, and admired, had ceased to be interested in the once attractive purlieus of the study-room; though to Helen, her absence was easily accounted for in the fact that Lilla knew of Herbert's temporary visit to other friends. The increasing devotion of May to our heroine might have afforded some solace under her difficulties, had she been at all congenial in mind or temper; but so wide apart, were her pupil's simple converse, the strength of the teacher, and the weakness of the scholar, that Helen felt more at ease out of her presence than in it. There was, perhaps, one thing in those hours of painful expectancy during which Helen awaited the advent of that dreaded visitor, with somewhat such a sensation as one would await the descent of an upraised sword, or the sure approach of the invisible bolt of a pestilence, that diverted her at intervals from the contemplation of her own inward struggles. Nor yet did even this arouse herfully, because of her preoccupation, or elicit the attention which, under other circumstances, it ought to have called forth. This ,'     262       HELEN COU1RTEENAY.  distraction from her one abiding thought, if distraction it were, was a marked and curious change in Cornelia's de- portment towards her father and herself. For the former, she had suddenly felt or feigned an affection so absorbing, that any one but a blind and delighted parent would have detected the new demonstration as not entirely genuine, but something covering a deeply-laid plan; not spontaneous,  but the growth of a purpose. What that purpose was, it was not easy to determine; and Helen, in her speculations, arrived at no satisfactory conclusion, calling herself cruel and unjust, when she likened those thin, white, nervous  arms, around Mr. Drayton's neck, to a serpent's coil,-those short, wavy curls, clustering on his breast, to a nest of vipers, which, if they could, would have stung the bosom against which they lay. In so acting, in this new phase of conduct, this lawless girl was to Helen most unattractive; there was no feminine softness in her manner, no true womanly graces of endear- ment; hard, cold, passionless, one naturally divested her of the delicious privileges of her sex as helpmeet or comforter, nor could the widest stretch of imagination fancy a child as drawing life from her breast, or her voice as hushing it with a soft lullaby to sleep. But even while indulging in this feeling towards Corne- lia, Helen, as has been mentioned, showed herself no mercy for her mistrust and harsh judgment, trying to convince herself that she was most uncharitable in her surmises; that she might, must be entirely wrong; that possibly her pupil's conduct was the result of a newly-awakened love for her hitherto neglected parent; a note struck from a string that never, until now, had been touched; a star shining forth from the heavens which- ere this time had been cov- ered with impenetrable clouds. Yes, what could it be, but a strong, new, daughterly affection? Granting, however, that she could so solve this problem, Cornelia's changed demeanor towards Mr. Drayton, not for a single instant could Helen imagine her bearing towards herself as springing from the same fount-tenderness. It were as easy to imagine an eye burningwith murderous intent to be the window of a pure soul.   HELEN COURTENA Y.        263 Those were terrible moments to the young governess, or they should have been, had she read them rightly, when suddenly looking towards Cornelia, she would find hergaze fixed upon her with an expression of cunning, a malignant leer of defiance, a look as though she held an invisible key, which, if she willed and dared, could pierce into Helen's bosom, unlocking every secret of her life. And again; when Helen, with blanched cheek, and an assumed expres- sion of security, almost afraid to remain alone with ode so deeply scrutinizing her trembling self, left her presence for relief, she would hear a low, mocking-laugh following her that quickened her pulses with a sudden terror and thrilled her as if breathed upon by a demon in mortal shape. Sometimes Cornelia's placid bearing was almost child-like in loveliness and simplicity; again, a sullen gloom kept her distant and cold. To-day, she gave no echo to her sister's ready laugh; to-morrow, dwelt apart in a world of her own, from which, emerging once more to the child-mood, the harmony of a happy family circle returned. These demonstrations, however, were not continuous, but only occasional, and even while our heroine pondered upon their meaning, they passed away, Cornelia's kindness of manner returning, while Helen concluded that they were a fantasy of her own brain, or explained them to herself by those ever-recurring words: "Miss Tracy, my daughters are strange." As she watched and wondered, in the midst of her perplexities, and quite causing her to forget them, Frank Stoddard, gentle, gentlemanly, and radiant with manly beauty, a strange combination for an object of dread, came to Greenwood Seat. A new arrival! The intelligence spread widely over the household, reaching Helen as well as others; but what flushed the rest with a keen sense of delight, drove every drop of blood from her face, and clouded her eyes with the most anxious and careworn expression they had ever borne. The time for action had come; long delayed but impe- rative, and haunting her for so many days as a phantom, now it had taken bodily shape, and she was powerless to resist it. Yea, when her hands trembled, her heart sank, and her voice falteringly asked for guidance-now, at the     264       IIELEN COURTENAY. last moment, when a sense of impending evil brooded over her like the spirit of darkness, she must act. Advice, counsel, assistance, are sweet to every child of humanity, even though each be imperfect,-and that is truly a dreary life which must be lived in unsympathizing silence. Hast thou a sorrow, and hearest thou a voice audible to thee only, whispering: "Share it, lay somewhat of thy burden upon another; divide the weight, it will be lighter thus cut in twain;" accept the proffered aid. Man's best prerogative is this mutual dependence, this sharing of pain; and soul-trouble divided, in the end may come to be no trouble at all. But no such voice was heard by Helen in that noonday darkness. With fleet steps she sought her own apartment, and realizing that no sentient being could aid her, looked from her window skyward and earthward, for some sign to guide her in her blindness-alas! finding not what she sought. Then were her thoughts all introverted; trusting to her- self alone, and seizing a pen, she wrote briefly and rapidly, a few lines, meant only for her cousin's eyes. "I am here, dear Frank, beneath this very roof; why, you must not know, except that it is my choice. I am the Draytons' paid governess, and under an assumed name, though I have done nothing to make me ashamed of my own. If you care for me at all, my welfare or my peace, seek to know no more. Meet me as if for the first time, and when you leave Greenwood Seat, forget me. My past is my secret-I trust it in your keeping. By the memory of our happy childhood, you will do what I ask, Frank, for the sake of your cousin Helen." Drawing a long breath of relief, as if she had achieved a wonderful thing, the poor child seemed very wise in her own conceit; then, without premeditation or reflection, im- pressing the note with the first seal that met her eyes, she crossed the corridor with haste, and rushing to the dining saloon, rang the bell, with what she thought dignified em- phasis; not furiously, in keeping with her own heart-beating- not timidly, in accord with her coward soul; but naturally,   HELEN COURTENA Y        265 as another might have done, for a servant by whom to send  her missive to its destination. It mattered not that the person who answered the cal was. almost a stranger in the house; one whom Mr. Drayton had brought with him from London on his last visit, or, if the fact were of importance, which it proved eventually to be, what she had to say was a sentence so simple, a direc- tion so unmistakable, that it was impossible for any one to err in understanding it: "Take this note to the gentleman who has just come." The words admitted no other inter- pretation than just what was expressed. In the meanwhile, another vehicle brought a second arrival, and he who sprang from it had a step so light, a face so redolent of joyous anticipations, a smile so beaming, that like the sun,' he brightened everything upon which his eyes rested. He was not what the world, in general, calls handsome; for strength, mental and physical, rather than beauty, were his prominent characteristics, each being de- veloped in perfection in his frame and countenance. One saw the first, the mental might; in his broad brow, his firm, determined mouth, and something within his eyes 'that wore a deeper meaning than intelligence, namely, the power to use rightly the God-sent gift; and the last, the physical might, in his commanding form, his strong sinewy ar, broad, open breast, and a certain air over all, plainly betokening, that place him wheresoever destiny would, his would be the foremost step, his the mind to lead and to command. And yet the weak frail cord that bound him externally and internally, and moved him like a fate, was the thought of a greeting he anticipated at Greenwood Seat from a slight, dependent maiden, who was even then trembling like a frightened dove, and dreading the developments of each succeeding hour. Entering the portal of the castle, he was just in time to receive a note, handed him by a servant, who simply said, with a respectful bow, that it was sent by Miss Tracy. The seal was uppermost, and he to whom it had been given, not desiring the domestic to observe the flush of joy that rushed from his heart to his face, bent over it, as if to examine the device. It was a woman's tiny, finely-cut hand, as perfect 12      266       HELEN COURTENAY. as lithographic impression could be, but the fairy thing was in itself nothing; what it expressed, everything. A hand, it might be the tenderest symbol of passionate affection, or a figure typical of the simplest expression of interest from friend to friend, or an emblem of the broadest benevo- lence, or merely a sign of welcome. He saw in it only the last interpretation, as according best with Helen's natural reserve, but even this entirely contented him; it was enough to know that the mute but speaking figure meant so much. Desiring to retain the pretty treasure, instead of breaking it rudely, he told the servant that an answer would be re- turned immediately, and was hurrying to his own apartment, where he intended to open the note with care, when, in- advertently turning it, he saw with dismay that the super- scription was not his own. Not his own, yet plainly in Ielen's hand-writing; and while his glad smile died away, mergel in a half-defiant scowl which the messenger read as anrer for his carelessness, he informed him of his mistake, and directed him to the guest chamber, where he would probably find Mr. Stoddard, the real proprietor of the mis- sive. And thus it was that Herbert Drayton was suddenly and rudely awakened from a sweet dream which had deluded him, for a while, with its rapture and bright promises. Away from Helen, he had measured her every look and word. Certain tones of voice she had used when address- ing him, thrilled him, even in memory, with a strange power; or her unforgotten glance, resting upon him for a moment with serious earnestness and then timidly with- drawn, said more forcibly than words, that upon him she had gazed, as she gazed not upon others, more fondly, more lingeringly, unconsciously to herself. Then he recalled her parting with Dr. Percival as being too calm and collect- ed for one in whose bosom burnt the fierce flame of love; and so musing, he indulged in the idea that the conquest that she had spoken of was already completed, and himself substituted in the place of the past, dead love-a wild, barely possible supposition, but one that clung to him with ever- recurring persistency, spite of all his attempts to fly from   HELEN COURTENA Y.       267 it. The bare shadow of such a thought was enough to arm him with giant purpose; it made him strong to plan entering into her very presence, to cast aside all conven- tionalities, to throw his arms about her, to hold her to his heart, and with gentle force to make her confess the truth- a truth girt about and tinged with light from the inner heaven. The day was almost divine, his drive homeward seeming to him a swift transition though fields of Eden; on the checkered skies, purple and golden, were written messages of hope; the morning air, scented with the perfume of wild thyme, whispered the harmonious word, and each rivulet that flowed along his pathway in audible voice, bade him hope, hope, hope. Soon, top soon, came the dissipation of his radiant vision, the fading of the rainbow he had conjured up. That note written by Helen's own hand, and directed not to him, but to a stranger-the mystery of the thing, setting aside the impropriety; the deceit-just heaven! deceit in her-if she were acquainted with Mr. Stoddard, and yet had ignored him in London at the opera-house; the thought of these inexplicable circumstances crushed him to the earth, and shook his faith-his blind, delicious faith-which had once been so sweet and satisfactory. Then seeking solitude as a friend, a comforter, his late joy a ruin, a miserable wreck, scattered and past gathering more, with his head upon his breast in deep humility, he almost cursed himself for doubting her for a single instant; and though, the double plot grew darker and darker, and the hateful thread of mistrust coiled and twisted in inex- tricable tangles, he was almost afraid even to try to un- wind it, since his successful efforts might lead to her condemnation. And so it came to pass that with the tenderest, wisest, best motives, he resolved to suspend even the shadow of judgment against her, and to wait. That is a good word, wait. It cools the heat of temper, makes the mind clear, perfects plans; it is the motto of the Creator Himself, displayed in, the germ, the bud, the blos- som; it goes hand in hand with hope; brings peace and health, or desired death; a slow worker, but a sure; it is a a,     268       HELEN COURTENAY. beacon pointing the Christian to the tomb; it is a torch relighted at heaven's portal. "I will wait," said Herbert Drayton with a sigh, and there was deeper consolation in the thought than man or angels could have given. Helen, in order to defer as long as possible the trying ordeal of meeting her cousin, on the plea of a headache (no invention on her part), desired to be excused from taking dinner with the family, a long and ceremonious meal at Greenwo d Seat, and only appeared in the parlor after the candles were lighted. It was the room where she bad first seen the Drayton family; and though agitated then, in consequence of her novel position, she had entered it with far less tremor on that than on the present occasion. The party there assembled were less cheerful than had been anticipated by its various members, so anxiously awaiting Frank's arrival; and even the guest himself, who expected to realize the delight of another Paradise, must have had strange notions of perfect happiness, if his ab- stracted air and troubled brow were types of the enjoy- ment and satisfaction which he was experiencing. Ill at ease, grave, silent, momentarily looking towards the door, as though fearing the entrance of a gnome or elf, his reticent mood cast a shadow over every individual in his presence; while, unconsciously to himself and others, his every movement was watched by another, who hoped to read, as one studies out the plot in a pantomime, the mystery which deepened, and grew darker in the deepen- ing. Sometimes Herbert thought of seeking Helen, and revealing just what accident had betrayed to him-namely, that a note had been in his possession, written by her, and meant for Mr. Stoddard; but a fear of annoying her, of forcing himself into her confidence, of discovering, per- chance, precisely that which she meant to conceal, deter- mined him to guard from her and all the knowledge he had gained. The watcher and the watched, however, no longer wait- ed in vainl. The door swung open, and gliding in, with scarcely a rustle of her silken garments, came the object of their thoughts.. Helen was no actress then; not being   HELEN COURTENAY.        269 able, just at that moment- to be quite composed, she could not entirely conceal her deadly pallor, nor hide -from the merciless gaze of Herbert Drayton the hollow look about her brilliant eyes, or their unrest, as they retained not for an instant their every-day serenity, but flashed fearfully bright upon the assembled group. Immediately upon her entrance, an introduction took place between the governess and guest. Surely, words so commonplace and simple as their names Mr. Drayton had never uttered, and yet, though unperceived by the rest, Herbertr marked the embarrassed look of the one, and on the par of the other-the gay, dashing visitor-a tremor in his tones en he spoke, not belonging to them, a flush on his face, "betokening what," he asked himself, impa- tiently; "love, surprise, indignation, joy? What?" "Wait,'" again said the monitor of the mbrning, and he could but obey; for, wrapt in a triple fold of mist was the denouement which he had expected their meeting to dis- close. If looks could be always interpreted, if the meaning of Helen's careworn expression, and her one long, searching gaze at the stranger could have been solved, Herbert would have understood the unspoken question which they asked: "You will do what I desire, Frank?" Likewise, the reply to Frank's voiceless answer, as it wreathed her face in smiles, would have been plain: "Oh, thank you; thank you!" But all remained blank, vague, and uncertain, after the brief look of intelligence exchanged between them; nor could Herbert's curious eyes pierce the veil covering her rapid thought, that sped in retrospection to the days of the long ago, and the happy, cousinly intercourse of their childhood; their hours spent by the murmuring brooks, where they joined their songs with the rippling cur- rent; the flowers to which they had affixed a language of their own, and twined by Frank in tasteful garlands around her rustic hat; their bold expeditions of discovery into thick, untrodden woods; their rides and drives. Nor were their maturer years unremembered, when their sports were changed to dignified enjoyments, and the pleasures     270       HELEN CO URTENA Y and pains of the student's life engrossed their time, each prominent link completing the story of their past, until she reached the hour of their parting, when he had uttered words like these: "Love me, and for thy sake men shall recognise in me greatness; and I shall return to thy side famous, and foremost in all good things, holding myself ever wedded to thee, thee only." While Helen thus waked memory from   its slumber, Frank thought not of the past, but of the living, real pre- sent, where, prominent in the picture, appeared his first passion, the fancy of his boyhood, a laughing girl no long- er, but a serious woman, with a depth within her won- drous eyes which he could no more fathom than he could gaze beyond and behind the stars. Did he love her as she stood there, self-sustained, a mystery, with something about her that made him feel as though he were in the presence of one whom, if he would reach, he must either lower from an imaginary pedestal, or to whom he must climb upwards? Had he loved her in those bygone days? Yes; in that brief self-examination he felt that he loved her now as then, with reverence. He would have rushed to her for counsel, or in grief, but not for sympathy. No; and his eves wandered away from her until they rested for an in- stant on another. At Helen's feet he could have sat, listen- ing to her as to a sage; but May he could have drawn to his breast, smiling or weeping with her in turn. Helen, like a splendid garden-flower, attracted him to admiration; AMay was a perfumed forest-blossom, to be worn and che- rished near the heart. And, alas! to the first, and not the other, he was bound by vows which it would be unmanly and dishonorable to break, notwithstanding her note bid- ding him forget-her; indeed, it was more imperative than ever that he should regard these vows, since she appeared to be alone, neglected, and in need of friends. While the mind of each, so long- parted, was invisibly and actively at work, Herbert continued to look for some index that would lnoint to the hidden machinery; but no more could he follow its unseen movements than discover the mechanism of the heavens, every supposition baffling him anew. Least of all could he understand the stranger's   THELEN CO UR TENA Y       271 inquisitive look of interest, as though he had a right to gaze unrebuked upon Helen; while, strangely at variance with his apparent curiosity, was the distant and guarded bow with which he had/recognised her entrance and Mr. Drayton's mention of her name. But at length it became needful for Herbert to put an end to his varied surmises, and to come forward, after his absence from Greenwood Seat, and address Helen; to offer his hand to her as one of the same household, to utter a few unmeaning, conventional phrases of every-day life: it was needful, the forms of society called for it; and yet his manner, when he approached, filled her with a sudden sink- ing of heart; his hand barely touched her own, his lips were unsmiling, frost lay upon the face beaming last upon her with the genial warmth of spring, and in the cold greet- ing it appeared to her as though the sharp, piercing blast of an Arctic winter had suddenly filled the room. Chilled and white, she felt akin to the marble images on the mantel but without their grace-unapproachable and rigid as a frozen pillar. Had he heard of her stage life? Was he afraid to ven- ture into the poisoned atmosphere surrounding her?. Was there bane in the glance of her eye, pestilence in the touch of her hand, a moral taint in her breath, that he thus looked and spoke? Self-tortured with these questionings, Helen for a moment gave way to bitter despondency. Every element in the circle was inharmonious, and the promised pleasure of the visitor's advent a myth. It was like many another pros- pect, beautiful in the distance, a display of finely-grouped rocks dotted with picturesque shrubbery; but on nearer view a shapeless mass of earth and stone, guiltless of any adorn- ing but bare and withered trees. And all because of her I She knew it; it pressed upon her like a terrible nightmare, robbing her of peace and joy. Something of the spirit of her days of acting, a remedy for,a desperate case, suggested that she owed it to the rest to thaw the ice in which they were so imbedded, and to instil something like life into their darkened midst. So thinking, and buckling on for the work a more weighty armor than many a mailed war-     272 7HELEN CO UR TENA4 I rior wears, because the heart which it covered was in itself so heavy, she employed those powers of fascination that had so long lain dormant and unsuspected beneath her quiet exterior, and fought a battle where cheerfulness and mirth entered the contest against gloom and discontent, and the dead weight of what is dreaded in society more than an actual shape of horror-stiffness. On her grave brow she bound, as it were, a glittering diadem; from a secret hiding- place took a cluster of sparkling diamonds and placed them on her breast; about her arms wound circlets of gems and gold, and stood transformed in sight of all, from the timid and retiring girl into the brilliant and entertaining woman of the world-in this guise charming each, individually, in a thousand ways. She sent away the frown from Cornelia's face, invoking in its place a shower of smiles; she, who knew him so well, brought out Frank's happiest mood, and with a touch of her hand upon his heart-strings, called forth harmonies that surprised even himself; she turned May's insipid words to keenest wit, exquisitely enjoyed, because pointed with a shaft of good-nature; she drew Mr. Drayton, with the nicest tact, from his nightly routine of papers and books to join their merry group; and even over the aged brother's quiet recess, so often dedicated to the god of slumber, shed the contagious light of her joyous presence, luring him to forget his evening sleep, while his treble laugh was heard mingling with the youthful voices. And still from one other, from the doubting, suspecting Herbert Drayton, Helen exorcised the spirit of distrust, until he ceased to remember that she was other than the beautiful enchantress who had stolen his heart away. From the storehouse of her youthful days, when her father had invented from his fertile brain amusements for hix only child, Helen brought out some of the intellectual games, which were both interesting and instructive, for the entcrtainment of the circle now assembled at Greenwood Scat. In one case, as a penalty to comply with the rules, forfeits were deposited, to be redeemed by the recitation of poetry. It fell first to Cornelia's lot to pay the fine in- curred, and she recited with admirable emphasis a choice )pa ssage, a translation from one of her favorite Greek poets,   HELEN COURTENA Y.        273 delighting her father and the others, who could not but applaud and admire her taste and selection. Helen's turn came next; naturally her thoughts reverted to the drama, where she felt so entirely at home, but she dared not trust herself, in her present excited mood, to declaiming from any portions of the plays familiar to her, lest she might for- get the tone suited to the drawing-room, an- emphasize her words in a manner more adapted to the stage. She there- fore chose an old ballad, quaint, stately, harmonious, and measured. The theme was not without passion, and it was impossible for her, notwithstanding her caution, not to enter into the spirit of the author, and to throw her whole soul into the recitation. Now the listeners heard a bird-like carol, now a note of war thunder, and again a human voice gifted with the grace of melody, and cultivated to the highest point of refinement. The ballad itself created an interest far beyond Helen's expectations or desire; in fact, it had been her aim simply to do her part in the most quiet way. Having committed it to memory in the long ago, before she had learned or un- derstood her own powers of elocution, she was not prepared for the effect it now produced. As she spoke the final stanza, and comprehending for the first time the beauty of the poem--a tale of love and high emprise-she was recalled to herself by the voice of the elder Mr. Drayton exclaiming: "Encore, encore." Bewildered and astonished at this extra- ordinary demonstration from such an unlooked-for source, and fearing that she had overacted in her recitation, Helen looked uneasily and anxiously around to judge of the im- pression produced upon the rest. May and Frank had an attitude of deep interest; Mr. Drayton likewise was absorbed and attentive; Herbert thoughtful, rapt; while over Corne- lia's face flitted a succession of expressions, plainly revealing jealousy, anger, and hate. Trembling at the storm she had helped to raise, Helen, immediately upon concluding the ballad, sought a retired seat; while Herbert, drawn spite of himself to her side, followed her. "Your gift of elocution is wonderful, admirable," he said, seating himself by her; "you hold the key unlocking our 12* 'j     2 7 4      HELEN C0 UR TEVA E. smiles, our tears. Many an aspirant to histrionic fame would give worlds for your extraordinary powers." "That was just what May was saying," said Cornelia, swiftly crossing the room, and confronting Helen for once steadily with her restless eyes; " she observed that what you said and did were worthy of a finished actress-a finished actress, Miss Tracy. Would the reputation alarm or annoy you? Speak!" Thus authoritatively addressed, Helen turned pale and red by turns, dreading a discussion with Cornelia, and fearing that her own next word might lead to a betrayal of that which she most desired to hide. Then, as ever, she was afraid of her interlocutor; moreover our heroine read, or imagined she did, beneath the simple question, something deeper than a mere passing inquisitiveness: but in vain was her refuge in silence; Cornelia was not to be put off. "Speak, I say," she urged again, with increasing excite- ment of manner. "Was my question impolite or impolitic? Most courteously was it asked, and I expect a courteous answer. Is there anything rude in my questioning, Herbert?" she continued, appealing to him, and for the first time appearing to notice his neighborhood. "Not rude, Cornelia; but abrupt, sudden. Sometimes you frighten one with your well-meant but impulsive way." "Ah, then, Miss Tracy needs smoother phrases, more lengthened periods; she shall have them. We were speak- ing of actresses," she continued, raising her voice that all might hear, " and I simply inquired whether----" "Whether Miss Tracy would like to be one," interrupted Mr. Drayton, understanding something of Helen's embarrass- ment, and renembering his promise to Dr. Percival about keeping her secret. "Certainly not; let me answer for her  the stage would be no place for one of her temperament; the quiet of a country home, such as ours, being far preferable. And now, Cornelia, since your question is answered, let us change the subject and turn to music; we have the elements of quite an imposing concert among us. Come!" The last word was uttered in a tone so peremptory, that Cornelia could not refuse to obey the summons. "So be it," she said, lowering her voice that none might hear   HELEN  O COURTENAY.   ,   275 but Helen, and glaring down upon her with wrathful eyes, "nevertheless, you have not answered me; and remember, /   some day I shall ask it of you again." Herbert having defined their position in their conversa- tion at Westminster Abbey (the distance between himself and a performer on the stage), Helen had determined what course to pursue-namely, though living under the same roof, to allow him to have no interest in common with her, and to avoid his companionship as far as lay in her power. It would have been an easy matter to confess to him that she had been an actress, and to disarm him of his prejudices against the profession; if that were all, her way was clear; but she knew that questionings must follow; her past history be searched into; her own name dragged to the light; perhaps her secret, in all its enormity, be unveiled to view. Dreading the exposure of her father's shame, more to him whom he had defrauded than to any one else, naught remained in her mind but the one paramount idea of doing what she eemed her duty. In order, then, to avoid Herbert, she left him, and sought, while they were arranging the music, the presence of the elder Mr. Drayton, who welcomed her with a glad smile to his retreat, and made her forget that terrible look of Cor- nelia, which was hateful even in memory. There had ever been a certain kind of sympathy between these two-the maiden, fresh, buoyant, and on the thresh- old of life, and the old world-weary man; it was the in- visible link connecting the last hour of the spent year and the first of the new. The oft-repeated tales of his youth wearied her-not; and while trying to choose those topics of conversa- tion most interesting to him, so pure and artless did he seem to Helen, that it was almost like awaking the mind of a little child to intelligence. Besides,- Helen found refresh- ment in his society; here laying aside for awhile the mask which her position had forced her to put on, nor dreading each moment the discovery of her disguise, but passively assuming many of the old characteristics of her former self. "I am glad that you have spared me a moment," said the old man, holding her velvet hand between his shrivelled palms. "You warm my stagnant blood into something like     27 d      HELEN CO URTENA Y enjoyment of existence. She is like the Spring, is she not, Herbert, life-giving, joy-giving?" Unconsciously to herself, Herbert was standing by her side; and Helen's low, musical laugh was checked when she discovered his presence. "You may compliment me as much as you choose, Mr. Drayton," she replied, in answer to the kind words that had been spoken to her, "but I cannot consent that you should force others, for the sake of being polite, to echo your praise." "I was hoping, Herbert," continued Mr. Drayton, still clasping Helen's hand; "I was hoping, if you should ever marry, that you would select one like her. She suits me; she is not, like Cornelia and May, regardless of their aged uncle's comfort and welfare, but a good-hearted little girl, kindly-affectioned and gentle. You will think of this, my son; she, not they, would brighten a cottage or shine like a queen in a palace. You will think of this, Herbert Drayton." It had been his thought for months--that, and naught else. It had been his only thought upon that day until noon, when his bright hopes faded into darkness and de- spair, and a death of hope had become between him and it. Meanwhile, Helen was softly trying to extricate her im- prisoned hand from the friendly grasp which held it, the conversation becoming so personal as to be painfully em- barrassing. "Are you tired of me already!" asked Mr. Drayton, in a petulant voice. "'Then go-but I should like to have you hear something about a certain event of my life; your truthful eyes seem to require the truth: He," pointing to Herbert, "assumes before the world, with my desire, that he is my son. To others let him be that; but to you, who have wound yourself so closely about my heart, in whose face I see the beautifuil light of sympathy, whose actions all seem to spring from a sense of rectitude, I would say more -that he is not my son; but, having lost my own che- rished one in a distant land, I have adopted him instead; chance, and a heroic act, leading him to me. I owe to him my life and the saving of my property. Need I say that   HELE N COURTENA Y        2" he has been all I could wish in his devotion and indulgence of an old man's whims, displaying almost womanly tender- ness towards a decayed trunk, waiting for the axeman's blow. Stay, Herbert," he continued, as the object of his panegyric was moving away; "I am telling her nothing new; she knows that you have good qualities; she likes you; I see it, for I watch her often and carefully." "Does she?" returned Herbert, in a tone not free from a touch of sarcasm; "then I, with a host of favorites, am honored by Miss Tracy's preference. Me she may like, but there are others more appreciated than myself." "Ah, well; is it so?" said Mr. Drayton mournfully, and quite fatigued with his unusually long conversational effort. "I had hoped-however, Herbert, we will not bind her to us without her will; but I doubt if, in the whole world, she could find another like yourself."  X Herbert glanced. towards Helen; he was not selfishy enjoying Mr. Drayton's praise, but looked to see if he could discover by her countenance the faintest echo of the commendation she had heard. Her eyes meeting his, their expression thrilled him with a sudden joy; in them were admiration, and something that, joined to it, makes up the whole of heaven-love! Alas! that he should so soon have interpreted that very look as the perfection of female coquetry. Had one brief moment been granted after Helen's uncon- scious expression of what was hidden in her heart, he would have spoken words then and there, assuring her of his un- dying passion, and have influenced her, in some sort, into a betrayal of her own feelings; for, though the estimate of duty may be high, there are some moments in life when human nature proves too weak to keep strict guard, and this, to Helen, was one of these; but, Cornelia approach- ing them smilingly (such was the language of her outward self), turned to poison their short-lived dream of bliss. "itss Tracy," she said blandly, " we have just discovered that Mr. Stoddard is a musical genius; and it so happens that many of his songs are yours. I have come to petition you to sing with him." Perhaps Mr. Stoddard prefers singing alone," returned     '2 7 8      HEL EN COURTENA Y. Helen, venturing upon a remark that might serve to excuse her altogether. "On the contrary, he says that he sings best when his voice is, as it were, under the shadow of another voice; will you come?" Helen concluded that it was more wise to comply at once than to seek for excuses that would be easily over- ruled; and yet the old memories that came when she found herself seated at the piano, with Frank near her, joining in the lays of lang syne, were such as to make her tremble with emotion. She dared not glance towards him, even with a look of rebuke, though knowing that his eyes were upon her in silent questionings that sooner or later must be given and answered in speech. To an indifferent observer, to all save Herbert, their demeanor towards each other was unmarked by anything unusual; but with Argus eyes he watched their every look, and with attentive ears listened for every word falling from their lips. After a brief prelude, so incoherent and indifferently per- formed that it was scarcely intelligible, Helen's pride asserted itself, the usual fascination which music had for her returned in full power, and the two voices in perfect unison, taught by the same master, emphasizing the same words, and with the same expression, filled the room with a melody that was perfect of its kind; the one-the manly voice, imposing, grand, and graceful in movement, a cloud floating over a summer sky-the other, Helen's flute-like treble, its image reflected in a glassy sea. And thus these two long-parted and loving each other so well, with an affection born in childhood, and now con- demned to silence, found a strange pleasure in this accord of voices; while the evening wore on, the listeners became en- tranced, the singers themselves absorbed in old reminis- cences, and speaking to each other, not indeed to any pur- pose, but with kind accents through the medium of sweet sounds. It was not easy to put an end to an experience so rare and delightful; but Helen, warned by the unusual lateness of the hour, felt the necessity of declining to accompany Frank any longer. Ere she arose from the instrument,   HELEN CO URTENA Y.       2 7 9 however, she changed the measure from their last brilliant song to a grand and artistic nocturne, that stole into the hearts of those who heard her like a solemn " good-night," and shed within her own breast the peace which such a style of composition brings to one who comprehends the soothing power of melody. The vocal entertainment having been concluded, Cornelia, May, and their father, had wandered off to the-quiet twilight of the other end of the apartment, Herbert was seated at a table not far from the piano, and behind it, his attention apparently being divided between an exquisite engraving and the music, while Frank still stood by Helen's side, as her fingers wandered over the keys, invoking therefrom the lulling theme. "Do you remember the name we gave it," said he, in a guarded tone, and bending down towards Helen; " a name linking our names together?" "Hush, you forget," she answered, sweeping the keys with an emphasis uncalled for at the moment. "And yet I have the right; you know it, Helen. Say one kind word." "Hush, hush; not here; not now." "Then when?" The music Sying away almost in a single chord, made her answer distinctly audible, though the rest of the conversa- tion, save a murmur of words, had been unheard by Herbert. "If I can, I will see- you alone." Rising from the instrument, and conscious for the first time of his near neighborhood, she turned, and met his eyes fixed upon her with an expression of scorn, while glad to escape from its blighting influence, she bade the circle adieu. If there was one thing above another prized by Herbert Drayton, it was the truth. He' forgave many things- faults, inconsistencies, short-comings, for the sake of con- scientiousness. In fact, with him " principle was a passion for truth," and it was easy for him to detect the presence or absence of it in those with whom he associated, because he investigated character'with the' same minuteness required in- his scientific researches. When, therefore, the fact dawned upon his incredulous mind that Helen was wanting in this     280       HELEN COURTENA Y. grand corner-stone of morality, he felt the contempt for her that shone from his eyes, though it was soon succeeded by self-accusation for allowing his judgment so completely to have been blinded by his passion. In like manner did he pity Dr. Percival for being the dupe of a trifling woman, who, even if she had only pledged him her friendship, was unworthy his trust. Again: "Were Mr. Stoddard," he argued, "he whom she said so expressly she was trying to forget, did her conduct upon that evening, her evident pleasure in his society, her promise to meet him alone, wear the aspect of an endeavor on her part to quench any affec- tion she might feel for him? Was not her manner, on the contrary, calculated rather to encourage than to repel him? Or, if he were not that object was she not deceiving him as well as others?" But with all his harsh judgment, Herbert found some slight comfort in the idea that Helen and Frank had met before; he could not, would not, believe that the note sent to him was written in mere wantonness of spirit; and though this rather lenient view of the case took away something of her culpability, still, in his eyes, the white, new-fallen snow was tainted, the unbroken silence of the forest glade no longer sacred to the charm of solitude. Waking from his reverie, he arose just in time to open tile door for Helen as she made her exit. She saw him bow low with a forced air of politeness, far more exaggerated than the occasion required, and she felt the mocking smile with which lie regarded her, and which was harder to bear than a cruel, cutting word. What had been heard of the conversation between Frank and herself, or if any of it had been audible to Herbert, Helen did not know; all was problematic. She only expe- rienced a bitter sense of loss, -though of what she could scarcely tell; a loneliness that made the world a desert. "Oh! this is frightful, horrible," she exclaimed, pressing her hands to her throbbing brow in the quiet of her own apartment. "Merciful heaven! is there no relief? And yet," she added with a sigh that had its being in the very home of despair, " better for him is his hate than his love. Alas! yes, it is best so."   HtELEN COURTENA Y.       281 CHAPTER XXI. HELEN had not miscalculated the force of the attractions at Greenwood Seat, and their effect upon hercousin, Frank Stoddard. Hours glided into days, days into weeks, and still, like' one charmed by a subtle spell, he remained, the happiest, brightest, most joyous spirit in existence, save at intervals, when a certain unwelcome thought, like a sharp instrument of steel, drove its point into his breast, making him pause and reflect for a moment in his dream of joy, to recognise in the intruding idea the pang of an awakened, though not exactly a guilty conscience. If it depended on Helen's presence to disturb the smooth current of his now blissful life, she did not give him much cause of annoyance in that particular, for, save at meals, and when her absence would necessarily be remarked, she now seldom joined the family circle, solitude being more congenial to her than a forced mood of gaiety; besides, she feared that some impru- dence of Frank, akin to that of the first night of his arrival, would attract the notice of the Drayton family. Cornelia's present phase led her into the woods on lonely excursions, while Herbert only appeared at intervals at the castle, spending most of his time, for reasons best known to himself, at the Benthams' Seat. If, after an absence of a day, and sometimes a night, Cornelia moodily, or May in a play- ful way, inquired how his intervening time had been em- ployed, the answer invariably had reference to Balthorp- that he had been on an excursion with the young Lord Rosemay, that Lady Rosemay desired an explanation of cer- tain theories in a new book, that Miss Bentham had insisted upon his looking in upon her charity-school, or that Lilla had enlisted him to group a cluster of pressed wild flowers, or to train a vine in her pet garden. Balthorp, always Balthorp. Thus Frank and May were continually thrown together in companionship, it needing but this constant intercourse to fan the slumbering flame in the bosom of the former to a living fire, and to kindle to noon-day fervor the glimmer- ing light in May's. Mr. Drayton, too, seemed entirely satisfied with the grow-     282       HELEN CO URTENA Y. ing interest between his child and guest, and looked forward with secret satisfaction towards the probable result of their intimacy, Frank's character being just the very ele- ment he most desired in his household-a cheerful landscape lighting up a sombre background. Nor was he unaware of the fact that the young midshipman had but few monetary resources, Frank's open disposition soon acquainting him with his affairs; a fact that did not disturb the fond parent, as his own fortune was ample enough to bestow upon his daughters a more than adequate support. Had Helen regarded Frank with any other than cousinly feelings, his devotion to May would have been most trying, but heart-free as regarded himself, she was rather interested and gratified at the existing state of things. Of May, she was really becoming fond; her character improved every dav, and Helen knew that her pupil was calculated to make the happiness of one like Frank; her pliant disposition, constant good-nature, and air of dependence when in his presence, being an attraction to her admirer, who felt elated in knowing himself to be a tower of strength for her weak- ness to repose upon. It was about this time that the young people at Green- wood Seat were bidden by those at Balthorp to a grand entertainment, a dejeuner in the open air, where the ar- rangements were all so made as to resemble a rural scene in Arcadia, rather than a formal, fashionable f6te. As usual, Helen declined to go; not for her were pleasure and pomp; but the others, full of joyous anticipations, eagerly accepted the tempting invitation. The dav was glorious, the fete an entire success; there were bowers, arches, flowers every- where, music and dances; shady copses with tempting seats for a tete-a-tete; retired walks; all moods and tastes appa- rently having been suited by those who had planned the agreeable pastime. When the sisters returned home Helen did not fail to observe an unusual cloud upon the brow of the elder, while May was overflowing with delight, recounting the experi- ences of the day. "The pageant was perfect," she replied, in answer to Helen's interested inquiries "and all due to Herbert's un-   HTELEN CO URTENA .        283 erring taste. It was he who, in conjunction with Lord Rosemnay, contrived everything. In requisition everywhere, he was one moment by Lady Rosemlay's side, to whom, humoring her various caprices, he seemned indispensable; another, aiding Miss Bentham in attending to the enter- tainment of the guests; another, called on by Lord Rosemay to be introduced to some of his titled friends desiring his acquaintance; sometimes engaged with the young Duke of Avondale in planning a visit to his country-seat; but often- est near Lilla, petting her, as everyone does, granting some extravagant wish, giving her a choice bouquet, or walking gravely by her side, and forcing her to put away for a while her restless mood for'sensible conversation. Once, during the day (I wish you could have seen the pretty by-play, Miss Tracy), Herbert led her to her mother, beseeching the latter to forbid her taking ice immediately after a contra- dance. It was delightful to Witness her charming pleading, so childlike and trivial, yet so graceful, as she stated her case to Lady Rosemay, who was seated under a canopy, in invalid state, sipping her coffee like some eastern queen. How lovely Lilla looked, in her sylvan dress, her blue eyes smiling from  beneath her gipsy hat; and how  bewitch- ingly, when Herbert, in a mock-heroic tone, defended his position, did Lilla put her little hand trustingly in his, owning herself vanquished, and declaring that in future she should be guided by wisdom so wondrous, without an ap- peal to any other power. You know, Cornelia, we have always likened Herbert, in appearance and bearing, to a king; well, to-day,/Miss Tracy, he was the king still, but discrowned, and without losing one jot of his royalty, mingling with gracious condescension among his subjects." If Helen Courtenay entertained the idea that she was so schooled as to be indifferent to everything, good or evil, concerning Herbert Drayton, she now discovered her entire self-deception. It is true, that in communing with her own heart, she could think of his death with perfect calmness; it would have been a relief, if in God's providence he had been taken away from a world, which to the happiest is a -state of turmoil, and translated to one of promised rest; but now, at the bare possible surmise of his loving  another,     284       HELEN COI 7RTENA Y. as conveyed in May's minute detail, and. the probable sequence, his marriage, the sharp agony of mental pain ex- perienced by her was too intense to be borne with fortitude. Most impatiently did she listen to Mav's recital, and never had she been so near losing the equilibrium of her temper, and commanding her in harsh terms to be silent, desiring, yet fearing, with strange contradiction, to hear her to the end. In this miserable conflict of feeling, which she felt, if allowed to master her, would terminate in the destruction of every noble and generous emotion, some distraction from her own personal state of mind was given by Cornelia, whose forbidding scowl grew deeper and deeper as May proceeded in her description. When it was concluded, Cornelia rising suddenly from her seat, approached Helen, and coiling her long, slender fingers around her arm, in a grasp so vise-like that the governess shrank from her with pain, addressed her: "Wehaze a common cause, I see," she said, leaning towards Helen, and looking with wild eyes into hers. "I have long suspected this, but let us not despond; at least, while there is a remedy at hand." Words so mysterious, linking them, as it were, together, made Helen once more mistress of herself. Drawing her arm haughtily away from Cornelia's grasp, she answered coldly: "I am at a loss to understand you; you speak in enigmas. Let us proceed with our lesson; we have been trifling too long." "Shall I explain what you do not understand?" returned Cornelia, a sinister smile, more sickening to Helen than a frown, disfiguring her face. "No." So abrupt, emphatic, and angry a monosyllable, from the lips of their usually placid governess, had the effect of making May, with something of the air of a frightened child, bend with diligence over her book; while even Cornelia, after staring at Helen for one moment with astonished eyes, followed her sister's example, and forgot, or seemed to forget, that there was anything in the world besides the beauties of Goethe and Schiller.   HELEN C0 UR TENA Y        285 Alas, for our heroine! A new and unforeseen experience was hers, on that and many succeeding days; a nervous irritability that it was- almost impossible to keep hidden from external gaze. All sweet, soothing ideas forsook her; she seemed to herself to be possessed of "envy, hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness;" and had it not been for a painful and ever-guarded self-control, her thoughts woulI have taken the form of vituperative words. The poor child's nights, too, wpre sleepless and tearful, the hours appearing to multiply interminably as she longed for dawn, longed for and yet hated the light that brought the miserable routine of another day. Whence the source of all this misery  Whence this dull, gnawing sense of unrest, her heavy swollen eyes, her bloodless cheeks?- Was it disease taking a mystic shape, and sapping away the springs of ex- istence? Or was it some unseen influence of evil, that, like a vampire, sucked the life-blood of her heart? These questions telen constantly asked herself, as a species of diversion-something to lead her away from the truth. The truth, what was it? It was useless to disguise it; like the comnpass needle, force it, distort it which way she would, in the end, regaining its correct position, it turned with sure index to a single point, and that point was Herbert Drayton, his devotion to Lilla, his departure from her world, his making the whole of another's happiness and the wreck of hers, the loss of him for ever and for ever. It was this, shame upon her to be so moved, uprooted, cast down by what concerned him who was nothing to her, could be nothing, save a memory. A day or two after the Benthams' fete, while this mood of misery was strong upon her, Helen, seated at her western window, was watching the calm   loveliness of the sunset  C scene, and wishing that there might reign in her own heart some portion of its peace. She was roused from her reverie by a slight knock at the door, and before she could reply to it, Lilla stood before her. She was like, and yet unlike, the Lilla of their first meeting.  A similar riding-habit draped, yet did not conceal her symmetrical form; the same plume shaded her perfect eyes; yet now, the light of her loveli- ness seemed to come from her internal self, as through     286       HELEN CO UR TEA Y. globes of alabaster, soft and exquisite in themselves, yet, when illuminated from within, displaying beauties un- thought of before. The fair girl, approaching Helen, knelt before her, em- bracing her tenderly. "I hope, dear Miss Tracy," she said, in loving tones, "that I have not, in these long days of absence, seemed cold or neglectful; but since you have refused so often to come to me, despairing of seeing you, I have snatched a moment from Balthorp to come to you." Helen rather repulsed than welcomed the affectionate caress bestowed by Lilla, endeavoring to free herself from her entwining arms; but Lilla refused to be put away, and like a little child, drew still closer to her friend, hiding her face when next she spoke. "I did not come here alone," she said abruptly, and then paused as if awaiting some question from Helen; but the latter remained obstinately silent, the old, impatient feeling pulling at her heart-strings, while dreading, abhorring to ear that which Lilla might next communicate-her engage- ment to Herbert Drayton. Wondering at her friend's silence, Lilla's next act was to draw her glove from her tiny hand, and holding it beneath Helen's eyes, displayed a magnificent circlet of diamonds glittering on her finger. The parting rays of the sun re- flected on the prisms, suddenly painted upon the walls a thousand gaudy rainbow hues. Had each been a written word of triumph for Lilla, Helen would not have under- stood their meaning better. "It has a history, this heirloom of a spotless race," con- tinued Lilla, glancing at the ring, " and you, of all others, dear Miss Tracy, must know it, you to whom it seems natural to tell everything. Last night," she whispered, averting her eyes, "it happened-our troth-plight I mean; he spoke to me first, and then taking me to my mother, asked her for her child. When she alluded to my youth, inexperience, and giddiness, he only smiled, and said that every hour would mend these defects; and when at last, wearied with his pleading, she consented, he drew me towards him and sealed the compact with a kiss upon my brow, so fervent,   HELEN COURTENA Y.        287 so grateful, so burnt in to my very being with its promise of love, tenderness, and protection, that I feel it still; and it seems to me as if you, Miss Tracy, and all who care for me, must plainly see the blessed impress of faithfulness. And oh, you cannot imagine," continued Lilla, growing eloquent in the praises of her beloved, ".how noble, pure, and good he is; how constantly he says that in me, faulty, wayward me, he has found all that he desires; and surely in findinog him, I want no more. But you do not smile, dear friend; you do not congratulate me as others do-my mother, brother, and sister; they -tell me that even my father, were he living, with all his fastidiousness, would approve. You are silent; something has saddened you; you are lonely, perhaps, or, now I see it, ill, flushed with fever. If you need companionship, only tell me so, and I will share your solitude the rest of this evening, and will try and amuse you with my foolish prattle." How lovely, how generous she was in her willingness to leave her newly-found happiness to minister to Helen in' her misery! The thought brought a blush of shame to the cheek of the latter as she compared her own selfish morose- ness to the beautiful spirit of the'freshy-betrothed, and making an effort, she at last spoke a few measured words of gratulation. "Thank you, dear child," she said, " for your confidence and tenderness; I do wish you a long life of happiness. But, Lilla," she continued, with earnestness, impressed with the solemnity of the bond and the priceless worth of him to whom she would be united, " are you sure that you love him as he deserves? Will you care for him in sickness and in health? Should his wealth take wings and depart, as wealth sometimes will, could you stand by his side unmurmuring, and share his poverty, perhaps in some remote village in America?" No sooner had these words left Helen's lips, than Lilla started up from her kneeling posture, and stood before her companion, astonishment upon her face, and her attitude worthy of a tragic queen. "The Duke of Avondale poor! Condemned to obscurity I Oh, never, never!" she exclaimed.     2 88      HEL EN C 0URTENA Y. "I thought," faltered Helen, apologetically, while a thrill of delight pervaded her whole being," I thought--  Very grand, very worldly-wise looked Lilla, the future duchess; then unbending once more to her humble govern- ess-friend, she said in return: "Ah, yes, I know what you thought; but you must for- get those wild, foolish words of mine in the laboratory. Mr. Drayton and I are the best friends in the world; nothing more. It was only a passing fancy of mine; a childish passion; girls, you know, will have such. I am wiser now, and besides that was quite out of the question, first on account of Mr. Drayton's age; next, because we Benthams," she added, with a slight curl of her rosebud lips, " only mate with nobles; and lastly, he has never breathed one word of love in my ears. Promise me to forget that silly episode. And now, good-by, unless you will let me stay to cheer you. You will not? Then, once more adieu." Throwing her arms about Helen in an affectionate embrace, which the latter now returned with more than equal fervor, the lovely creature departed. It was foolish, weak; but as the door closed, tears streamed in torrents from our hero- ine's eyes, while her heart beat with a fuller throb of happi- ness than it had done for many days; for once in her life, Helen Courtenay knew what the sensation was of weeping for joy. Lilla Bentham's marriage was not long delayed. The young Duke of Avondale pleading as men desperately in love are wont to plead, and finding most potent reasons in his favor, gained his point. Having promised his mother to meet her the very next week at the Lakes, he was obliged to leave Balthorp to fulfil his engagemant; but averring that it was impossible for him to be absent from Lilla so soon after having won her for his own, it was decided that she should accompany him as his bride, and together with most of the party then assembled at Balthorp, make the tour proposed. Though Lilla was most urgent for Helen's presence at the wedding, the latter gave her old excuse of preferring retire- ment to society; nor was the plea a fabricated one, since, fearing among the guests at Balthorp there might be some   HELEN COURTENA Y.       289 of the fashionable crowd who had witnessed her acting in London; or even, if possibly there were not, she knew too well the light in which a governess would be regarded among the proud aristocracy there, and cared not to subject herself to their coldness or disdain.  Nevertheless, Helen longed, with true woman's curiosity, to see Lilla in the new character of bride; and Mr. Drayton, her host, understanding something of her wishes and scruples, -kindly proposed to accompany her in a quiet ride on horseback to a spot where they could see a part of the pageant without mingling in it. There were few invited besides the gay party already at Balthorp, the chief portion of the jubilee being out in the open air. The day was superb: the bridal party proceeded from Balthorp at noon to the chapel in Lord Rosemay's park, the route being tastefully decorated with garlands and floral arches. Never had Helen beheld Lilla so radiantly beautiful as, when alighting from her carriage, she stood for a moment upon the green sward, clad in a cloud of gauze, draped in her gossamer veil, and crowned with orange blossoms, with the bluest sky of summer above her, smiling upon her nuptial morn. It appeared to our heroine, from her post of observation, like a lovely vision, the train of bridesmaids, the retinue of noble guests passing onwards to the chapel, and then disappearing from her view and from the interested eyes of the silent crowd. To Mr. Drayton as well as to Helen, the scene must have been most impressive in its intermixture of solemnity and joy, for many minutes elapsed before he broke the charmed silence by speech, and soon Helen perceived by a mnovement among the crowd that the ceremony was concluded. Then appeared the blushing bride, leaning upon the arm of her husband, and followed by their friends, while, as the youth- ful couple advanced, the multitude without received them with one prolonged shout of welcome. Then banners floated on the air, the workpeople in their holiday suits came forward to greet the happy pair, while the children from the schools strewed their path with flowers. Among the company issuing from the chapel, Helen's heart, looking out from her eyes, recognised Herbert, upon 13     290       HEL EN COURTENA F. whose arm leaned a fair and beautiful woman, whom he was conducting to her carriage. Whether there was something in Helen's glance or appearance that drew him to her, or whether he merely came as a form of politeness to greet Mr. Dravton and herself, as being of the same household, she could not tell, but only knew that upon his face, when he discovered their presence among the crowd, there was a pleased surprise, and that, after taking leave of his compa- nion, he joined them. "I am glad to see," he said, after his salutation, and addressing both, "that you are enjoying the air, the hour, and the moving picture around you. Was ever day so aus- picious as this bridal morn?" Then turning to Helen- "Having heard that you were not well, I was unprepared to see you here, and now I trust that you are fully restored to health." "That was only Lilla's idea," answered Helen, her manner, as she had planned, ice-cold, but her words (ah, the lesson was so hard!) breaking forth from the unnatural thraldom, playful and benign; "by contrasting the light of happiness in her own face with that of others, she imagined an indisposition when none existed. I suppose that you heard of my fancied illness from her?" "Yes," returned Herbert, "she was my informant." Then a shade like a summer cloud flitting over his face, while the momentarily forgotten memory of Helen's note and words to Frank Stoddard returned to him, he added: "but I should have remembered what a wide difference there exists between seeming and being; I should have thought of that before I spoke." So saying he bowed, and hastened away from her by whom he fain would have lin- gered in sympathetic enjoyment of the scene; and while feeling that in avoiding her, he was following his highest duty,.he departed, with the rest of the bridal party, to Bal- thorp. The day was so bright and health-giving, that Mr. Dray- ton proposed to Helen a continuation of their ride, and enjoying the sunshine and his pleasant converse, she gladly assented to his proposition. They returned, in consequence, rather later than the others to Greenwood Seat. While ap-   HELEN GCORTENA Y         291 preaching the castle entrance, Helen observed Frank rest- lessly walking before the door, and was not surprised to see him come forward and offer to assist her to dismount; Mr. Drayton, with a few pleasant words bearing upon the old saying of April and December, flowers and frost, giving up the right to his young guest. "I must see you alone, Helen," said Frank in a low tone to his cousin; "I am playing the part of a hypocrite; I hate myself cordially, and you only can give me counsel and advice. When, when can you grant me a few minutes' con- versation?" From his tone, his' excited 'manner, and his evident dis- tress, Helen knew that the interview he desired could no longer be deferred. Telling him, therefore, to meet her on the morrow, before the breakfast hour, in the library, he pressed her hand and smiled his thanks, when she left him and entered the castle. On descending to the place of appointment the next morning, Helen found Frank already awaiting her, and while they greeted each other with a long, close, cousinly clasp of hands, the mask of apathy and coldness fell from them like a garment. But a little while could they spend together, and Frank improved the time by at once entering on the subject of his doubts and difficulties. He besought Helen immediately to make their engagement known; to give him the right to protect her; to explain to the Dray- tons their exact position, and by so doing, to prevent the continuance of a course of conduct on his part, injurious to her, himself, and another. He confessed with manly-open- ness and deep: contrition his dereliction from the strict path of duty, insisting that he must that very day leave Green- wood Seat, if Helen refused compliance with his wishes. With that perfect candor which had always been so attrac- tive, he referred to May's fascinations and the power they had over him, beseeching Helen, since she had exposed him to them, to put forth her hand to save him from further self- humiliation. In reply, Helen told him that he must not forget that' their engagement had been only conditional; that time and absence had changed them both, bringing to him matured     292       HELEN CO UR TENA Y. manhood, with new views of life and new tastes, and to her- self, other and far different aims than those that had been hers when they had exchanged their youthful vows. That lie found her, whom he had once known as a wealthy heiress, under an assumed name and in a dependent situation; which mystery she thanked him for respecting, still trusting to his love and consideration for her, never to seek to un- ravel; that, in the next place, their mutual poverty pre- vented a renewal of their troth-plight, even if they had con- tinued constant to each other; that they had changed was incontrovertible, she having but one object in life, that of desiring to remain unmarried, and in obscurity, in her orphan state; and he, apparently, but one also, she added, with a smile of sympathy, love for a certain fair-haired maiden, who evidently was not his cousin Helen Courtenay. Next, with an earnestness of tone that Frank could not resist, she relinquished all claims to him then, there, and for ever, assuring him that she but esteemed him as a cousin; and while bidding him "God speed " in his suit, as he stood flushed with a sudden joy, with thanks in his heart and on his lips for her kind wishes for his happiness, she vanished from his sight. That afternoon witnessed the betrothal of Frank and May, the delight of Mr. Drayton, the satisfaction of Cornelia, and the astonishment of Herbert; the last of whom, having been absent at Balthorp during the greater part of Frank's visit, had seen but little of his devotion to Ilay. But while he regarded the arrangement with wonder, unfortunately it did not any the less make him distrust Helen, the curse of de- ceit still rendering her repulsive in his eyes. The wedding of the lovers at Greenwood Seat, however, was not to be solemnized as precipitately as that of the Duke and Duchess of Avondale, the plan being for Frank to proceed to America on his official business, which now could no longer be delayed, resign from the navy, return to England, and then be immediately married. The next day, leaving May half tearful, half smiling, he departed, with the brightest hopes for the future, from Greenwood Seat. --o--   HELEN CO7URTENA Y.        293 CHAPTER XXII. AFTER the excitement of Lilla's wedding and Frank's de- parture had subsided, there was but little, for a time, to disturb the monotony of the hours at Greenwood Seat. Cornelia's restless moods increased, rather than diminished; but as they terminated in no positive evil to herself or those interested in her, and as the old, confidential servant, whom Mr. Drayton had deputed to watch her when her wander- ings led to any distance from the castle, reported that her only object seemed solitude, and that she appeared to be well acquainted with the most intricate wood-paths, her evident desire to avoid companionship was regarded as a part of her character, and as such tolerated and allowed.  Herbert had long since discovered that to be consistent, he must shun rather than court 'Helen's society; and act- ing upon the promptings of his conscience, after a mighty inward struggle, accepted Lord Avondale's invitation to join the bridal party in their excursion to the Lakes, and was busied in arrangements for his absence, the more -impera- tive, since Helen appeared to him daily in a new and attractive light, in consequence of her attentions to his adopted father, who, accustomed to be neglected by Cor- nelia and May, was roused, as it were, to a new lease of life, by the gentle ministrations of the young governess. To be useful was one of Helen's passions, and since -Cornelia was now so often  absent from her recitations, May inattentive and occupied with thoughts of her distant lover, Herbert no longer coming to her for even occasional aid in translating a difficult German passage, and Mr. Dray- ton not requiring her in his world of books, she found some satisfaction in the idea that the eyes of one, at least, brightened at her approach, and that a not unfrequent, fer- vent, "God bless you, child," from the old man's trembling lips, told of an appreciation of her efforts tot amuse and interest him. Blessed sight, this linking of age to youth, the hoar forest-tree with the wood-violet smiling at its root! See the old song, revived again by young lips, bringing back d"     294       HEILEN COURTENA Y. long ago memories, and moistening dim eyes! See the feeble step growing quick, guided by a strong, firm arm, and the frame more erect, supported by an unbending form! Hark to the palsied tongue, almost condemned to silence, becoming eloquent because of an attentive ear, indulgently listening to its tales of yore! Witness the flush of joyful surprise on the wrinkled, passionless face, at being includ- ed in some simple pastimes, suited to the tastes of other days! Behold how the patience of the speaker is reward- ed, when, at last the dull ear comprehends a bright remark, a pithy anecdote, or the stirring or trivial news of the day and mark the smile, playing upon the colorless lip, caused by some slight attention, costing the giver nothing, but which is counted as golden ore in the heart of the grateful recipient! It is said that little things make up the sum of existence to men blessed with strength and hope; how much more true must this be of those who, in the decline of life, catch at the faintest shadow of sympathy, treasure up a kind word or a tear shed for pity, and carry the remem- brance thereof even into the grave. The day being fixed upon for the departure of the bri- dal party, HFerbert bade adieu to the family at the castle the night before, intending to set off for Balthorp by the light of a late moon, after a few hours' sleep, and join- ing his friends, whose plan was to partake of a breakfast at day-dawn, to proceed with them to London, there to make final arrangements for their journey. To Helen it was a night of dreams, weird, dismal fancies, frightful in their approximation to truth; and while she turned restlessly upon her pillow, awaked by some horrid, ideal shape, she felt willing to relinquish all the beautiful vi- sions of night, past and future, for one hour of calm repose. Thus musing, and but half aroused from her uneasy slum- bers, her ear caught the sound of her own name, quickly, imperatively called; and while undecided whether it was a night-mare, ghost, or a reality, she distinctly recognised in the unwelcome tones, Cornelia's voice. "Open your door, at once, immediately, Miss Tracy." The mandate being obeyed, Cornelia entered. Helen glanced at her to see if, without questionings, she could   HELEN COURTENAY.        295 discover her untimely errand, but found no fright or tremor in her expression or manner; she was as placid as a summer sea, all save her eyes, and they seemed to our heroine to glow as a living fire in their sockets, like two spires in flames above a calmly sleeping city,-the repose of her face. and figure, while her eyes were thus blazing, making the contrast peculiar, or, as Helen thought, awful. "So perfect a night," said the intruder, "was never meant to be wasted in sleep, Miss Tracy; concluding that it would not be disagreeable, I have come to ask for your companionship in a walk. I shall be most happy to re- maih here until you are ready to accompany me." While Cornelia deliberately sat down, as specified, to await Helen's pleasure, the latter regarded her unwelcome and unexpected guest with undisguised astonishment. "Perhaps you do not know the hour," sne returned, glancing at her watch, whose hands plainly pointed to the small hours of the night. "I have thought of that," answered Cornelia in calm tones, "but spirits like yours and mine know no difference between day and night; let meaner souls than ours sleep." "Though you see fit to elevate us so far above the 'com- mon herd,' Cornelia," answered Helen, "still, I must con- fess that the very thing, the only thing, I want just now, is rest. I pray you be sensible, return to your room, and leave me to the quiet of mine." "Then you refuse to go " "Yes, I think that it would be unwise, absurd, and be- sides, imprudent." "And yet you had best reconsider your decision," re- turned Cornelia; "you know," she continued mysteriously, "they are watching me nowadays, and as I have deter- mined to take this walk, think of your immense responsi- bility, if I should be found-well, absent, in the morning. That is the mildest word I can think of just now." Helen paused for a moment and mused. Cornelia was certainly in an unusual mood, her deportment as well as her words hinting at some catastrophe to herself; and know- ing that her wilful, determined spirit, if once resolved upon a certain course of action, could never be convinced by ar-     296       HELEY COURTENAY. gument or persuasion, and moreover feeling that Mr. Drayton would approve rather than condemn her espion- age on the present occasion, she turned to her and said: "On the whole, I will go with you, Cornelia." "I knew that you would; that was in the programme," was the quiet reply, while the flame-lit eyes burnt brighter as she spoke. "But for fifteen minutes only," said Helen; "the walk must not extend an instant over that time." "Yes, that will be all-sufficient." Then while Helen completed her toilet, Cornelia sat mo- tionless as a statue, save that she watched her every move- ment, hither and thither, with such close, piercing scrutiny, that Helen felt as though an invisible spell were being woven around her, caging her, like a doomed fly in the meshes of a spider's web. Feeling this subtle, almost un- bearable influence paralysing her every movement, she tried to remonstrate with Cornelia, endeavoring to persuade her to postpone her walk until daylight; but her efforts were of no effect, except to make Cornelia more deter mined, while our heroine had no option but to accompany her, hoping as soon as her pupil was convinced that she had gained her point, to induce her to return to her room. As soon as the door closed behind them, Cornelia twined her arm in Helen's (an unusual demonstration of affection), as if to guide her on her way, and before many seconds had elapsed, our heroine found that avoiding the grand entrance, and passing down the stairs through the long cor- ridor, they had entered the paved way leading to the labo- ratory. Here Helen remonstrated upon the route they were taking, telling Cornelia that she preferred to reach the outer air by a different path. "But the lake," answered Cornelia, "looks so inviting through the stone casement! I promised to keep you just fifteen minutes, and if you desire, will return at the expira- tion of that time; you, likewise, must be true to your word. There is no danger of our meeting any one at this time of night, and, really, you will be rewarded by the ex- quisite loveliness of the scene. Besides, if you do not ac- company me, I must go alone-alone, do you hear?. Have   HELEN COURTENAY.        297 you forgotten the day of our intended visit to the beech copse, when they moved heaven and earth to seek for me? afraid,-of what were they afraid, Miss Tracy?" So questioning, Cornelia peered close into Helen's face with her terrible, scintillant eyes, and partly through fear, partly with the thought of doing her duty, but chiefly to perform her promise, and so end her companionship with her undesirable guide, she allowed herself to be led onward to the window, where the moon poured its light in a flood of radiance over them both. For a moment Helen was lost in admiration of the view before her, so placid and inviting; the gentle wind, just a soft breeze, played upon her face and rippled the silver sheen of waters. She cared to look no further out into the night, towards the park or the dis- tant forest, or up into the skies; it was enough simply to take into eyes, heart, sense, and soul, that moonlit mirror alone, and naught else, "Yes, Cornelia, it is perfect," she said at last, with a long-drawn inspiration of delight, "I think that I shall go back and sleep soundly now. *Like some sweet strain of music, it has made a lullaby for me, and rocked my unrest to quietude. Let us go." "It is here that he, likewise, comes at times, to muse on Lilla," returned Cornelia, without regarding Helen's latter words. "The heavens remind him of her azure eyes, the lake of her dimpled cheek, the balmy zephyr of herbreath. It is here that I have brought you to nurse your legitimate revenge, our revenge, Miss Tracy; I told you it was a com- mon cause. Stay!  So saying, she seized Helen with a strength superior to her own, and held her fast, while the latter, fearing that a struggle to be free might arouse Herbert, though indignant and frightened, remained passive in her grasp. "You know," said Cornelia, hurriedly, "that he loves her, aye, even though wedded to another; his every thought is hers, and to-morrow his plan is to go with her to the Lakes. But he shall not. I have sworn it. He said," she continued after a slight pause, and with increasing excite- ment, "that he should leave his door unfastened for my father's servant to awaken him at the desired hour, not re- 13*     298      IFR LEN COURTENRA Y. tiring to his chamber to-night, but snatching a little sleep on the couch in the laboratory, ready for an early departure for Balthorp. I fancy I see him now; his white brow up- turned, his splendid eyes curtained with their long, dark lashes, his breath coming softly through his chiselled lips, his hand upon his heart, beating, oh, God, beating only for her. But never, never more shall it throb for Lilla; it shall be stilled this night, this hour, in death. This is why I brought you here, Aliss Tracy, this,-to keep watch while I hush, for ever hush, his sighs for the Duchess of Avon- dale." "Dear, dear Cornelia," said Helen, with an assumption of affection she was far from feeling, "leave this place; you are in an excited mood and know not what you say. Come with me to my room or to yours, anywhere but here, and let us seek repose of mind and body, if not in sleep, in soothing, tranquil conversationL  Let us return; the time allotted for our walk has expired." "And what is time," asked Cornelia, with a contemptuous smile, "but the ticking of aSvatch, the rising and setting of the sun, sowing and harvest?  Bold deeds know not hours; certain lives are not lived by the strokes of a pen- dulum, but by thoughts matured into acts; besides, only one thing can soothe, can calm me, Miss Tracy, and that is, to know that Herbert no longer loves Lilla.' "Then be soothed, be calm; I am sure that he does not love Lilla; it would be guilt." "Yes, it is just that," Cornelia moodily replied; "the guilt of the thing; Herbert must not sin. Here is that which will save him." Still grasping Helen with one hand, and approaching nearer to her than before, as though to prevent her escape, Cornelia drew from her bosom a small, sharp stiletto, and held it up with an air of triumph before her companion's eyes. "It has the true Toledo ring," she said, looking upon it admiringly, " and is pliant yet firm, slight yet sure. Once out of the vender's hands, every deadly weapon becomes a thing of AMemory or Hope,--Memory of some deed accom- plished, Hope of something to be done.  Now this little   HEL7EN C OUR TENA Y.       299 instrument includes both; the last is to be achieved to- night; the first is but a tame joy compared with what will be. Nevertheless, such as it was, it was bright and pleasant. And how seldom is Memory a solace!" she continued, mu- singly. "Bad remembrances are like ghosts; they sit at your table, walk by your side, lie on your pillow, come in troops-one calling another, chilling your blood in summer- time, and heating it in winter with words, or shapes, or deeds, that provoke mental pain, and uninvited stay by you; good remembrances only come when bidden, and, as you smile them a welcome, flit phantom-like away." "Now that I know the future of the little weapon, pray tell me its past?" returned Helen, with outward calmness, though her blood was chilled, and her heart beat wildly with dread and fear as she spoke. Though intensely agitated, our heroine felt the necessity of perfect self-command; and this was, indeed, difficult to preserve, when all her surroundings were so dreamy that she could not divest herself of the idea, possessing her more than once since she had come to Greenw ood Seat, that her stage life was being reenacted, she personating the leading character in a great drama, endeavoring to gain the good9- will and approbation of a critical audience. The picture- like moon, the stone casement, the lake beyond, the arches in the open passage-way ; the plot I that cruel woman stand- ing there with her glaring eyes, toying with her jewelled dagger and whispering her tale of blood; tHe unconscious sleeper near; the silence, the hour: all increasing the illu- sion, and' assisting her to imagine the reality unreal. Only for brief instants, however, was Helen so deluded; the naked truth appearing in too strong lights to admit of doubt. Then, since viewed in all its bearings, the cata- strophe seemed inevitable unless it was prevented by her- self, she resolved, at the risk of her own life, to endeavor to save Herbert Drayton's. So resolving, she breathed a short mental ejaculation that took something of its coloring from her past experiences, and betrayed the lingering idea of her still doubting the verity of the scene: "Oh, that I may play my part in this terrible hour with success!" Strengthened by the possible thought of overreaching     300       HELEN COURTENAY.  her companion, she turned to her with a winning smile upon her face and said: "Yes, relate to me the history of your dangerous pet; I am sure that it must be interesting." This demand suggested itself to Helen's ingenuity and woman's wit as a means, if it were replied to, of arresting Cornelia for awhile in her cruel purpose; a means to gain time for Mr. Drayton's servant to come and awaken Her- bert-; or for Herbert's own lackey to announce to him that all was in readiness for his departure; or for himself, won- dering at the delay, to step forth from the laboratory un- aware of his peril, calm and collected, defeating and con- founding by his appearance the intention of the murderess. Helen knew that there was another way to arrest Cornelia's purpose, namely, by some unexpected demonstration from herself, such as a scream, or loud knocking, that would arouse Herbert from his slumbers; but that very action, she reasoned, would perhaps hasten his death, for Cornelia, furious with rage at being thwarted, might rush in upon her half-conscious victim and complete her deed of revenge. "Yes," replied Cornelia, holding the stiletto lovingly in her hand, " it is an interesting reminiscence, at least to my- self, being a relic of one of a series of tableaux performed in Paris, in which I took a prominent part. They were per- fect, Miss Tracy, in artistic arrangement. I wish that you could have seen them." "Tell me about them," answered Helen, eagerly, her eyes beaming with interest, her soul almost in the attitude of a listener. "In what scene was the pretty, deadly thing em- ployed? And was it connected in any way with a repre- sentation in which you were included? If such was the case, it must have been effective and striking, and anything but a failure." How dainty was the flattery that Helen scorned, and yet, what did she not dare to save that precious life! "So they said at the time," replied Cornelia, evidently pleased with Helen's apparent appreciation. "Mr. Rand, the artist, conceived and managed the whole affair. All the scenic parts were true to nature, and he himself was the chief figure in the picture chosen for me. I dare say you have seen the engraving called ' Le Brigand en Embuscade.'"   HELEN CO URTENAY.         301 "No; pray describe it." "Well, relieved by a background of rocks, overhung by drooping forest trees, are the brigand and his wife. Rand is extremely handsome, and though entirely refined, has a dash of the corsair about him, well suited to the cast he undertook. His dress was in perfect keeping, consisting of a tall, cone-shaped hat, and large, open collar, while about his neck were strung watches and miniatures stolen from unwary tourists. His gaudy apparel was half draped with a Spanish cloak, while, with gun in hand, he leaned over the rocks watching with intense interest a party of travellers in the pass below, that night to become his prey. I, as the wife, stood a little behind him, the Albanese coiffure and arrow upon my head, long priceless pendants in my ears, my tight, well-fitting sleeve terminating in a gold band studdeal with jewels, and upon my fingers many a ring once the pride of the nobles of the land. One hand was laid in a caressing way upon the brigand's shoulders, while I looked with him upon the group below; the other was play- ing with the hilt of a dagger half concealed in my bosom, the woman in my face, the demon in my heart. Then, Miss Tracy, this," she continued, holding up the poniard, "was the plaything; now ---but time flies; watch until I return." "Stop one moment, Cornelia," said Helen, as the voice of the former, that had been sweeter than the sweetest music to her ears, ceased speaking, because it delayed the dreaded hour; "you have forgotten to tell me about May's part. She also must have looked and acted well as a Beren- garia, or some kindred blonde." "Yes, May was perfectly charming; some other time, not now, you shall hear about her." "One thing more, Cornelia," returned Helen; " you have not done entire justice to your ruby and emerald hilted favorite. There is one gem, the most prominent, that is the finest I ever beheld, seen at this distance. Will you let me examine it for myself? Will you trust it to me for a moment?" "Not for half that length of time," was the answer; "when it leaves my hands it enters yonder noble but mis- guided heart."     302       HEELEN COUR TE A Y. Then, as she moved away, Helen, in her turn, held her fast, making a last attempt at a remonstrance, and obliging her, by the very force of despair, to listen to her words. She might as well have discoursed to the winds. "Cornelia," she said solemnly, " have you reflected that you are about to commit a murder; that you may be found out; that retributive justice may reach you, and that you, in your turn, may suffer the full penalty of the law for break- ing the command, Thou shalt not kill." "Yes, I have thought of all this," was the answer, accom- panied with a weary sigh. "Death to me has only charms, not terrors; of life I am as tired as a child longing for rest on its mother's bosom. For me the thought of death, in other words of annihilation, is beyond expression delicious. There is something grand in the old philosophy of oblivion (for such, I believe, will our future be), after we have acted our little part here on earth. Then, blessed thought, there is only a blank; no one is loved in vain; no one missed; nothing but nothing I How much more sublime is this, the thought that we are quenched for ever, than that we shall live in some sort, as we do now, in the hereafter, this sad, chequered, restless, hopeless existence.".; Ere Helen could attempt to say one word in argument, or to refute her views by citing Julia Dearing's blessed hope of immortality, Cornelia dashed away the few tears that had sprung to her eyes, and with a warning gesture, and a look that forbade any more tampering or soft plead- ing, because it meant resolve, broke from Helen's hold, and stood with her hand upon the latch of the door of the laboratory. CHAPTER XXIII. As Cornelia turned from Helen towards Herbert's door, our heroine raised her eyes upwards, for an instant, as if in prayer. She thought of her own weak, frail self, compared with her pupil's strong frame and tall stature, of her probable   HEL EN CO URTENA Y.        303 lE'e, her hate finding a new object; aye, she contemplated the possibility of being crushed to death in those sinewy arms, or meeting a bloodier fate, like that intended for Herbert; but above all other considerations rose the idea of saving one beloved life, and there was no more delay in her purpose. Gliding noiselessly behind Cornelia with a quick, agile tread, often in requisition in certain scenes upon the stage, with a desperate effort of will and sleight-of-hand, Helen snatched the weapon from her companion, who, off her guard, was quite unprepared for the act, and hurled it through the open window into the lake, where, with a sullen splash, it disappeared. Then, as Helen had surmised, the hate, the fury, the hellish purpose were all directed towards herself. With the instinct of self-preservation, she tried with swift feet to escape, but was foiled by Cornelia's outstretched arms and fleeter step; while, as a last resort, she uttered a frantic cry for help, but in Htle very utterance the sound died away in silence; for Cornelia, nerved with something stronger than the might of passion, twining the fingers of one hand around Helen's wrists, and so binding them together in a firm, cruel grasp, with the other caught her throat in a vice-like clutch, having death as its object and intent. For one instant the governess looked at her with an expression asking tfor pity, and then we glad to shut out the frightful view, realizing the truth of what she had long in silence suspected, by the horrid glare of Cornelia's overhanging eyes, her distorted face, her foaming lips, her low hideous laughter, that she'dwas at the mercy of one who was, for the time, in its broadest sense, entirely mad; and resigning herself to a terrible death, mentally commended her soul to Heaven. "Hist! hark!" said Cornelia, suddenly loosening the glipe with which she held her victim, " some one approaches. You -have thwarted me, but not utterly. Now I have two to avenge myself upon, instead of one. Bide your hour; it will come." So saying, she led Helen to the casement, where the wind blew refreshingly upon her over-tasked and fainting frame, and while she leaned against the friendly support, Cornelia boldly stepped forward to meet the intruders.     304       HELEV COURTEAA Y "Why are you here in this place and at this hour?" asked a voice, in an almost angry tone, which Helen dream- ily recognised as Mr. Drayton's. "Do you not know that these precincts are sacred, at least at night, to Herbert and his friends, who have ingress and egress at all times? To see you here, Cornelia, is but in keeping with your late obstinate habit of roving, though, I must confess, it seems strangely out of season after midnight; but much I marvel to see Miss Tracy in your companionship; good sense and delicacy should have taught her that this is forbidden ground." Here Helen tried to rouse herself to answer, and make a defence, but before she could shake off the stupor be- clouding her mind, or decide what to say, Mr. Drayton continued: "Had it not been for my servant, whom I had ordered to watch my daughter's eccentric peregrinations, I might have been kept in ignorance of this indiscretion. Thank Heaven that Herbert, at least, is spared a knowledge of it, having altered his arrangements, and started last night, at a late hour, for Balthorp. Even Thomas," he continued, in a sarcastic tone, "must have thought your visit here not in accordance with his strict notions of propriety, for in returning from assisting in the preparations for departure, he saw you, unknown to yourselves, and came immediately to acquaint me with the fact of your being here. I hastened at once to beseech you both to retire, bringing May with me as one, perhaps, who would be more influential in per- suading Cornelia to return to her apartments, than myself." Still faint and weak with the struggle so lately undergone, Helen advanced to explain, as delicately as she could, her peculiar position, when Cornelia, calm and collected, with a glance of scorn at her trembling companion, replied to the scathing words of reproach just uttered by Mr. Drayton: "Never, until to-night, have I known you to be unjust, father," she said, ' never before have you imputed blame to one not deserving it; hear my excuse, and then judge if with so keen a lash you need have scourged your own child in the very presence of the real culprit. We are not entertaining an angel," she continued, with another con-   HELEN COURTENA Y.       305 temptuous glance at Helen, "but something far different, as you will soon discover. I confess to my foolish and use- less, but innocent whim, of loving to roam abroad, especially when others sleep, and feeling particularly restless, I thought that a walk in the avenue to-night might be just the thing to incline me to slumber. On approaching Miss Tracy's room, what was my astonishment to see her cautiously .open her door, pass through the entry-way, down the great stair- case, through the corridor, to this spot, where I had the curiosity to follow her. As she approached the door of the laboratory, I could not withhold from her the fact, even though you have placed her as a mentor over May and myself, that I was a witness of her proceedings, and placing my hand upon her arm as she turned the latch, she uttered a faint scream of surprise, which you probably heard on your way hither. These are the simple facts, the wonderful cause of this solemn gathering, much more resembling a theatrical representation than the real thing that it is." "Just heaven!" exclaimed Helen, now quite recovered from her stupor. "Mr. Drayton, can you, will you believe this? This false, wicked charge? I pray you, sir, let me tell the story; it may make you think less unfavorably of me. But not here, not before witnesses; I will disclose to you, in the library, all that I can understand of this com- plicated affair." "Yes, father, believe- this and more," said Cornelia authoritatively. "Let the matter be settled here. Trust me, Miss Tracy is unworthy the position she occupies. Let her reply to a few questions of mine, and then judge whether she be innocent or guilty. Upon her own admissions rests her condemnation or acquittal; the slur upon my veracity must be done away with at once," she continued, turning to Helen, "and moreover before witnesses, which you seem to dread so much." "I do not think that your father will have anything to regret in having no listeners to the communication I desire to make," said Helen calmly, endeavoring to carry her point, with the hope of sparing May, at least, the revelation she considered it her duty to make, for Herbert's future security, of Cornelia's crime or insanity. , Upon this course     306      tHELEN COURTENA Y. she had decided, although fast relinquishing the last sup- position, since if it were madness, there was so much method in it, as to make her doubt its existence. "On the contrary," replied Cornelia, haughtily, "justice to myself requires my presence; will you be kind enough to answer a few simple inquiries of mine? Can you deny that you have occupied the equivocal position of an actress?" "I cannot, and yet," added our heroine proudly, "such a position does not presuppose indiscretion in thought, word, or deed." "Assuredly not," said Mr. Drayton. "Nor does the first conception of sin presuppose an actual perpetration of a wrong act," continued Cornelia; "it is only the vestibule leading to the grand body of the whole structure. In so important a matter, let us note every step leading to it. Can you deny that you were protected one night on your way from the theatre by a nobleman, notori- ous for his intrigues, and that without any demur on your part, but evident satisfaction at the arrangement, you al- lowed him to accompany you in the face of all London to your home?" "I cannot; and yet I assure you that I was ignorant of the character of the man, nor have I ever seen him since." "That is nothing to the purpose," replied Helen's inex orable judge; "all that we need are certain facts, well authenticated, and admitted by yourself, against which there can be no argument. Let us continue. Can you deqy, that after having allowed the protection of this immaculate mar- quis, you accepted that of Dr. Percival, who secreted his prize in-a most effectual manner from prying eyes and tongues?" "For shame!" exclaimed Helen with indignation, and no longer misunderstanding the drift of Cornelia's remarks; "do you dare to call in question one single act of your father's friend? I blush for you, Cornelia, at the very thought." "And I, too, must add my remonstrances to Miss Tracy's," said Mr. Drayton, "when you impeach Dr. Percival's good faith. If your charges are not of a more serious nature than this one, I acquit the object of them at once of all indiscretion."   HELEN COURTENA .        307 "Pray spare yourself the trouble of defending your admi- rer, and reserve your blushes for yourself," answered Cornelia, addressing herself to Helen. "But one thing more remains, and perhaps when that is said, my father and May, stand- ing incredulous there, and looking pityingly upon your un- protected innocence, may change their minds and deem you only too guilty." "And unless your final accusation," returned Mr. Dray- ton, " be more conclusive, with my parental authority I must put an end to this insulting strain. You have brought forward no single item that Miss Tracy may not be able to explain away to our satisfaction. Though her position as governess may be a subordinate one, she likewise has that of a member of my family, and I feel bound to give her my countenance and support." "The last question that I would ask," continued Corne- lia, without deigning to notice her father's words, and steadily confronting Helen, who, by this time, had regained her dignity of manner, and looked the guiltless person that she was, "is this: can you deny that a few minutes after the arrival of our late guest, Mr. Stoddard, you sent a note, the common talk of the servants' hall, to his apartment? Are you blind to the shame of the thing, and his deserved coldness to you, and utter ignoring of your existence? Say, can you deny sending this note?" Fixing her basilisk eyes on Helen, Cornelia appeared to demand an answer, while May, whom this charge vitally con- cerned, tremblingly awaited her reply, and Mr. Drayton gazed for the first time with anxious solicitude upon the face of the accused. "'Nor can I deny that-the sending of a note," answered Helen, forced to reply, but with ashen lips and pallid cheeks; "and yet-"  She paused. "Proceed," said Mr. Drayton, most urgent for her excul- pation, while he could not fail to notice her changed manner, plainly revealed by the light which May carried, striking fully upon her, as being no longer that of one above suspi- cion. "And yet I aminnocent," she added, recovering in some sort her self-command; "believe me when I tell you," and     3308       tTELEN CO ZTENA Y. her voice had a tone of flute-like clearness, " that though seemingly guilty, I have done no wrong, and most- foully have I been accused. I implore you, Mr. Drayton, believe mac, and end this painful interview at once." "I would serve you if I could," he returned, his manner somewhat colder than before; "but since my daughters seem to desire it, and really, the matter when explained, I am sure, will be entirely insignificant, I must unite with them in the wish to hear the contents of your note to Mr. Stoddard. In fact, Miss Tracy, that will necessarily restore perfect harmony among us; for when Cornelia hears upon how frail a foundation she has thought fit to condemn you in this particular, she will have the grace, I am certain, to withdraw whatever other hard thoughts she may have against you, without further delay." "Yes, dear Miss Tracy," said May, with sweet good-na- ture, " simply tell us this, and prove to Cornelia that her accusations are all incorrect." Helen saw clearly what an effort it must have cost May to say this much, feeling that she had most cause to be in- dignant at the seemingly bold act of forcing a written com- munication on one upon whom, subsequently, she had a claimn; and blessing her in her heart, she for an instant for- got her painful position, and smiled benignly upon her younger pupil. "i We await your decision," said Mr. Drayton, with in- creasing hauteur, as Helen showed no disposition to make a confession. "Poor, credulous May!" chimed in Cornelia sarcastical- ly, with a leer of triumph on her face. "You see how promptly Miss Tracy vindicates herself from all blame." These taunting words restored to Helen the memory of her position, and turning one more appealing look upon Mr. Drayton, while in her inmost soul hating the hu- miliation, with clasped hands, as though praying for mercy, she besought him to confide in her integrity, and to trust her without more explanation. Before she had finished her appeal, an insulting laugh from Cornelia rang through the arches, followed by other mocking words:   "HELEN COURTENAY.         309 "Let her prove her innocence, father," she said; " insist upon it, in justice to myself." Thinking that if she could only gain- Mrr Drayton's ear, to tell him of the wild occurrences of that night, and not sur- prised at May and himself for distrusting her, since Corne- lia's perverted but plausible accounts had painted her in such a guilty light, Helen, in her desperation, asked for the last time to be allowed either in private, or, if that were de- nied her, in the presence of his daughters, to reveal the dreadful scene through which she had just passed ; after which, if Mr. Drayton was not satisfied of her devotion to his in- terests and her innocence, to be willing to be condemned as one utterly unworthy of his trust. She could not help taking the comfort to herself, that even though unable to produce the stiletto as proof, nay, though they might ac- cuse her of fabrication, her earnestness and her own con- sciousness of rectitude would give her recital such a stamp of reality, that the parent, pausing with alarm at the idea of having in the bosom of his family so dangerous an in- mate as his elder daughter, and grateful to Helen, though grieved at the revelation, would stop other investigations in regard to the imputations upon her own con0duct. But Helen had miscalculated; Mr. Drayton was inexora- ble, and, she could not but conclude, just. "No," he said emphatically; "nothing can be plainer and more direct than Cornelia's statement; prove your guiltlessness in the matter of the note first, and I will pro- tect and defend you against all hazards; refuse to do so, and. justice to my children requires that your relationship of teacher and taught be at an end/; the sooner, agreeably to your convenience, the better for all concerned." Then it had come to this; she was banished, politely, but banished nevertheless, from Greenwood Seat; her word doubted, an outcast, branded as an adventuress, her fair fame tarnished. At the thought, the impress of whole years of, suffering was seen in her face, 'as one sees a fair tree in an instant blighted with lightning, or a verdant field scorched by fire. The light of hope had left her eyes, and they had assumed that expression like a " sorrow's crown     310       HELEN COURTENA Y. of sorrow" displayed in the sad orbs of Beatrice Cenci, be- tokening a mute, solemn, and wordless despair. Unlike the experience of her poor, doomed favorite, Des- demona, whose ignorance of that with which she was charged in some sense lessened the cruelty of her fate, Helen had full knowledge of her accusation. Was there no relief, no alternative but to reveal the con- tents of that note, and thus render valueless all her work in the past, so giving them a sure index of her father's faith- lessness Would her tyrant inquisitors be satisfied with but a part of her story? Would it suffice only to tell them that Frank was her cousin? W4ould they not surely reject that assertion as a part of a chain of falsehood; or, if they did believe her, would it not be easy to trace back- wards, step by step, her identity and all that concerned her? Again; should she tell her sad story minutely, as a last re- sort, exacting secresy from those present; could she count upon Cornelia's faith, with the hate she evidently bore her? Would she not rather feel infinite satisfaction in blazing the mystery of the life of one so despised to the world? Turn where she would, Helen saw no refuge; and though perhaps her reasoning was in a degree morbid, her spirit tried, her bodily frame weary, her eyes longing for the slumber denied her in the exhausting watches, still through the darkness she found no single ray of light to guide her on her solitary way. At length a voice dispelled her reverie; it'was Mr. Dray- ton's, saying in somewhat peremptory though guarded tones, that they were waiting with impatience whatever communication Miss Tracy might have to make, the more so, as the night, so far advanced, would soon merge into daylight, and suggesting the propriety of their not being discovered in their present solemn conclave by the domes- tics, who, before long, would be astir about their usual avocations. "Grant me a few brief moments more to collect my thoughts," returned Helen, trembling and undecided. Then, interpreting this as a prelude to an explanation, May's face brightened at the idea of the clearing away of the mist from the character of her friend and governess,   HELEN COURTENA Y        3" while Cornelia, fearing that her victim might find means to escape from her meshes, busied herself with a new scheme. for shielding her own perfidy should Helen's innocence be established; and Mr. Drayton, rejoicing in the thought of the restoration of tranquillity and peace in his household, blandly encouraged the desponding girl in her supposed determination of making a full confession of her misdeeds. But they were mistaken, each and all. "I cannot sufficiently applaud your intention of render- ing all clear that is now clouded," said Mr. Drayton, be- nignly. "You know," he continued, apologetically, "I could not have acted in this matter otherwise than I have done; for to have pursued a different course, would have left the stigma of deceit upon Cornelia, whose greatest charm has ever been her adherence to the truth; and when a father loses his confidence in his child, the whole domes- tic structure of affection is overturned, and social love be- comes a wreck." As Mr. Drayton uttered these words, a marked change came over Helen. Her head was lifted, one foot a little advanced before the other, her face turned from the group in profile, her hand, with open palm, upraised, held in an attitude of one who, listening intently, discovers far off sounds unheard by other ears. "Yes," continued Mr. Drayton," a father's trust in his child is a solemn, sacred thing." How surely had he struck, unintentionally, the very key- note of her life! Then the unseen charm was complete. No longer abject and asking for pity, but erect and calm, she stood, a mys- terious power emanating from her eyes, and the martyr- spirit clothing her like a gorgeous drapery of light. Hold- ing, as it were, invisible scales in her hand, she weighed with nicest exactness her father's lost honor and her deatr- bed vow, against her own tarnished innocence yet con- scious rectitude, and with beating heart and holy purpose awaited the test. "Let me be true to him," she said, mentally, as she be- came aware of the result, " and trust the test to God." They who beheld her had seen in their world-wide wan- ', t     312       HELEN COURTENAY. derings a sunset gilding a cloudy sky with a sudden sheen of glory; and verdure bursting from a sterile soil, after an April shower; and the heart of a rose-bud blushing into bloom in the noon-day heat; and a blank canvas, beneath an artist's touch, in an instant eloquent with beauty; and a round moon silvering a hoary ruin with mystic loveli- ness; but never this-a serene joy, born so quickly of despair. Then, they, her accusers, wondering at her aspect of in- ward and outward peace, did not seek to question her more, as she passed spirit-like from the group, saying, the while, with mien of majesty, and looking back with proud eyes as she slowly left their presence: " 1 shall make no confessions, no explanations; if you believe me not when I say that I am innocent, nothing more will you believe. See, the day is breaking; a few hours will separate us for ever. With many thanks for your past kindnesses, I bid you farewell." This, for them, for the world, the outside: but for her- self, the solitude that she sought, and for heaven,-"Oh, father, father, father " Oo  - CHAPTER XXIV. HELEN'S preparations for leaving Greenwood Seat were soon completed. Considering her farewell in the basement as final, and concluding that it would save much embarrass- ment, she remained in her own apartment until her departure. Mr. Drayton communicated with her in as delicate a man- ner as possible respecting the monetary part of their agree- ment, and was just and generous in his compensation for her services, offering her, also, the use of his carriage, after it had conveyed her to London, as long as she desired it, to make plans'for her future. Having finished all the arrangements that appertained to herself, Helen penned a few lines to her host, whom, spite of his hard judgment of her, she could not but admire   HELEN COURTENAY.        313 and respect, giving a concise account of the occurrences of the night, and beseeching him to watch over Cornelia, lest some greater misfortune should come to their once happy home, leaving him, without any comment, to form his own opinions in iregard to his daughter's conduct, and adding, that though still feeling what she had written would proba- bly gain no credence from him, she felt it her duty to make a simple statement of the facts. This communication she directed to be handed to him upon her departure. This concluded, she sat down, awaiting the announcement of the vehicle that was to take her to London. She was in that restless, unsettled state, usually preceding a journey, when there is nothing more to be done, and one awaits the motion and change of scene; an objectless phase in exist- ence, and not entirely separate from a feeling of dreariness and ennui. Helen did not shed a tear in self-pity, and a spectator would have seen no signs of inward woe, save that on either cheek burned a bright crimson spot, while her hands trem- bled as though weak with age. Gazing from her window, for the last time, upon the familiar sights, the beautiful prospect in the full maturity of summer, our heroine did not hear her door open s tly, nor see that one entered, with cautious tread, as intthe presence-chamber of mourn- ing and death; nor wa she conscious of companionship, until detecting the sound of sobs, like those of a little child who had sought her, to tell her of heart-troubles and wrongs. Then turning, she discovered May close by her side weeping passionately. "They told me not to come," she said brokenly, "but I would not regard them. Oh, Miss Tracy, if you would only tell me, May, the contents of that note; only say some- thing, something that will take from you the dreadful doom of banishment, all will be well. I cannot think you guilty of improprieties; though, alas, I must, since you are so reticent, when a few words would make me believe in your innocence. Sometimes what Cornelia says, and what you keep back, forces me to think the very worst of you; then I reflect, that if you were indeed contaminated, Frank would have given us some warning, some gentle hint to "     314       HELEN C0 UR TEAAY. send you away; but then, again, it occurs to me, he is so tender-hearted, that he would not have said one word to wound any one, and perhaps purposely left your unworthi- ness to be discovered, as now, by time. Dear teacher, friend, no tongue can. tell how I hate this parting; how very, very much I love you; how, even if I never see you more, I shall love you still; how, though it may be impru- dent to utter it, though you are the thing that Cornelia says you are and your silence admits, I shall love you ever, hoping for some hour, when repenting, you will confess your fault, never, never more to swerve from the path of duty again. Once more, whether guilty or innocent, will you not tell one who loves you as I do, all? Or, even as my father asks, simply the contents of' that fatal note?" Gazing up in Helen's face, May asked the question with a beseeching look, and was so winning and attractive with the conflict of hopes and fears, the desire to believe in her beloved teacher's rectitude, and the dread that she was to blame, that her governess, smoothing back her hair, looked unblushingly and frankly into her face, and though weary of reiterating the same idea, said: "Dear May, only this can I say: trust in me; nothing that I have done, had it been done to-day, and nothing in the note to Mr. Stoddard would trouble your peace, if you had seen my every act and written word." "I seem to feel that, at times, in my inmost soul," was the answer; " and then a cloud covers my hopeful thought with gloom." "Entemtain the first impression, and reject the last," an- swered Helen, with an affectionate smile; " try to reject it, and you will succeed. And now, farewell again; the car- riage awaits me. Kiss me, darling May, for the last time. You will not? Only one kiss, for you are going to be so happy, and H--.   Only one. Do you indeed refuse it?  Oh, May!" But May drew back and turned away from Helen's em- brace. "When I last kissed you, I thought you pure," she said, "but now--" A sudden fresh flow of tears took the place of words, while Helen, the flush on her cheek a brighter crimson, and her   HELEN CO URTENA Y.        315 eyes dry and glowing like living coals, with the bitterness that one's own heart only knows, sped swiftly down the stairway, unheeding the call of her vacillating pupil implor- ing her to return, and in a moment after had entered upon her lonely journey. Once more in London; wide, dreary, unsympathizing Lon- don!  What soul-sinking, what weariness, what loneliness were Helen's.? -How her heart ached for the friendly shelter, once her own, at Greenwood Seat, while even the things inanimate that she had left behind filled her with new regrets-the shade trees, her evening seat at the lake-window, the companionable paintings. Of Herbert she dared not think, save as one as irrevocably lost to her as the dead, for even were they to meet again, with the stain upon the whiteness of her character, she knew that he would avoid rather than seek her society. Thus, as retrospection was no more attractive than anticipation, our heroine, praying that she might forget every event of her sojourn at the castle, together with each and all its inmates, and learn to live a new life with new associations, turned with a deep- drawn sigh to contemplate the position she held at her journey's end. Her plans were these: to order the coachman to drive to Dr. Percival's, and taking Mary with her, without alighting from the carriage, to seek for a humble abode until some- thing offered itself for her occupation. TTpon arriving at Dr. Percival's, Helen inquired of the servant who appeared in answer to her summons for her old attendant. There was sorrow and sympathy in his face as he informed hcrf that she had been stricken with paralysis the day before; that her life was despaired of, while with W imperfect utterance, she often called on her young mistress as though with a desire for her presence; that a letter had been dispatched for her to Greenwood Seat that very day, which having heard, the patient had seemed more tranquil. Helen waited to hear no more, but springing from the carriage, followed the servant to Mary's room. How different was this bed of death from the two she had witnessed-her father's, where mental pain was the chief characteristic, and Julia Dearing's peaceful translation;     316       HELEN COUIRTENAY. physical suffering,. or what seemed so, being the predomi- nant trait of the present one. Great was our heroine's dismay and grief at finding her- self scarcely recognised by her servant-friend; but she was welcomed warmly by Mrs. Dearing, who was in faithful attendance on the sick bed, and who expressed, in cordial terms, her gladness at beholding her once more, and the comfort it would be to Mary, should her entire consciousness return, to know that she was near. After brief self-commune, Helen decided that it was her duty to remain where she was, at least for the rest of the nearly spent day, and desiring Mrs. Dearing to direct the coachman and tired horses to be cared for, took her station at the sick bed, oblivious of everything but the agonies of her once devoted nurse. Nor did she think then of the fact of her being in the house of Dr. Percival without his know- ledge, or remember the cruel insinuations thrown out against him at Greenwood Seat, but only of her ministrations to one who had left every tie to follow her unknown fortunes in a strange land, while she blamed herself for not understanding and appreciating before that hour self-abnegation so entire. Watchful at her post, the afternoon wore into evening, the evening to night, and midnight came. With the last came Dr. Percival from his round of visits to inquire into the welfare of his humble patient. But he paused at the door at the unexpected scene, his heart throbbing with emotion as he beheld Helen, who could not possibly have arrived in answer to his summons, bending over the dying woman.  It was no hour for questioning, and coming for- ward to save her from all embarrassment, he met her as if it were the most natural thing for her to be there; nor did she feel at that moment either inclined to give an explana- tion or called upon to make it, being actuated by but one desire, to save, if possible, that fast ebbing life ; for added to the affection she bore Mary, Helen shrank from the idea of being so utterly alone, as she felt that she would be, in the event of her attendant's death. Thus, after the silent greet- ing between Dr. Percival and herself, she asked in a whis- per if there were any hope of life. No, there was none; Dr. Percival could not, would not,   HELEN COURTENA Y.        317 deceive her, and told her all that remained was to make the good woman's departing hours as peaceful as possible. But it was most trying to Helen to witness her struggles; the desire for speech when the tongue was almost silent, the pleading eyes, the labored breathing, the fearful convulsions that seemed to be tearing apart soul'from body, the thirst, the hopeless agony. Midnight brightened into dawn, and still the watchers sat waiting, andit was not until the sun had risen high in the heavens that a message of rest came to the longing spirit, preceded by a fiercer convulsion racking her tired frame, and death-gasps coming more quickly, and every breath sounding like a suppressed shriek; then followed the set teeth, and rigid limbs; a hush, and all was over. Helen real- ized the truth by the solemn stillness and the grave, sorrowful faces of the others; then, with a long look of love at the senseless companion who had cared for her in childhood as well as in her mature years, she turned to leave the room, still unweeping, but with a world of woe in her heart, to follow and confer with Mrs. Dearing upon the arrangements for the burial, and to consult her as to a temporary place of abode for herself. While taking a step towards the door, she was strangely affected by weakness and a trembling in every limb, but holding a chair for support, stood for a moment to make her acknowledgments to Dr Percival for his kind- ness, and to bid him farewell. Holding out her hand to him, she thanked him warmly for his care of Mary, and told him, as she could be of no more use, she would go home again; then, remembering that the wide world contained no such place for her, she asked him pleadingly, like a trusting child, forgetting that he was ignorant of her banishment, to direct her where to go. "Your sad dutv over, that of closing the eyes of your kind attendant," he replied, " if you think that you will be sufficiently rested in an hour or two, perhaps it would be better for you to return, to Greenwood Seat." Her only answer was a mournful negative. "Then, since you seem so weary, so fatigued, bodily and mentally, remain here," he urged, "'until you feel quite strong again. If you desire it, you shall not be annoyed by my presence; absenting myself until your departure, I will     318       IELE    GO JRTENA Y. leave you to the hospitality of Mrs. Dearing, and most grateful shall I be to know that you are using me and mine for your comfort and convenience," Helen's eyes overflowed; what unkindness had failed to achieve, a few sympathetic words readily effected. "You would not ask me to stay," she faltered, " if you knew that I had been sent from Greenwood Seat in disgrace." Dr. Percival looked at her for a moment fixedly, while the red blood mounted to his brow, and an angry shade, like the clouds of a coming storm, swept across his face. "Disgrace!" he said, in a tone of scorn and contempt; "eternal infamy, rather, to those who have done this cruel thing. Were the whole universe to condemn you, I should still say stay I " "But I cannot, must not," she replied, while a sharp sen- sation of pain in her head, and an increase of weakness in her limbs, interrupted for a moment her speech. Then, when the poignancy of the agony was a little abated, she added, drawing her hand across her eyes, like one awaking from sleep, "I must find some other home; farewell, dear friend, kind friend. I shall never forget your goodness and consideration." So saying, she made one step forward, the old, proud step, that was a part of her noble bearing, when a sudden dizziness overcoming her, her eyes closed, the world grew dark, life a blank, while slowly, slowly, slowly, as a star dis- appears in a western sky, she sank upon the ground. Dr. Percival caught her hand. ; it was burning. He felt her pulse; it was beating violently. Then, upon closer examination, he saw that her cheek was unnaturally flushed, and that a fierce fever raged in her blood. The excitement of those painful hours at Greenwood Seat, her unequal struggle with Cornelia, the loss of rest, the trying death- bed scene, and her own lonely condition, had unmistakably made their mark upon her, resulting in an entire prostration of her nervous system. At a glance Dr. Percival under- stood her case, and encircling her in his strong arms, while her head fell like a dead weight upon his shoulder, bore her to the adjoining apartment, which was that occupied by Mrs. Dearing, and laying the insensible girl upon the   HELEN CO URTBENA T.       319 bed, endeavored with the assistance of the former to bring back suspended animation to his precious charge. But the fainting-fit merged into the delirium of fever, giving the prospect of a long and perhaps fatal illness. For once, Dr. Percival, doubtful of his skill and ability in the profession to which he was devoted, would not trust himself with so valued a life; and he who was sought for in consultation for the most perilous cases, now enlisted the services of a brother physician to attend upon Helen, while he humbly took the position of watcher and nurse, counting the pulses of his patient as though each beat was in itself a doom of life or death. Then it was, too, that Mrs. Dearing's quiet virtues shone conspicuous, having been educated, as it were, for a sick- bed by her daughter's couch; and thus, all that science, affection, or attention could devise was well and promptly done for the invalid. The day after Helen's attack, Dr. Percival received a letter from Mr. Drayton, by the messengerhe had dispatched, inclosing his own summons to Miss Tracy. In this missive Mr. Drayton briefly informed his friend of the departure of the governess, adding that she had left under circumstances so painful that he did not like to dwell upon them, especial- ly as they were of a nature that could not be enlarged upon in writing; but that when they next met, he hoped to have a long, frank, and confidential conversation on the subject, when he was sure that, biassed as Dr. Percival was in favor of the young lady, he would agree with him that it was best for their intercourse to terminate. Dr. Percival's reply to this communication, after several days had elapsed, was a hurried one, and, in spite of all his efforts to the contrary, cold; telling Mr. Drayton can- didly, that though he had not the slightest knowledge of what had happened, he could not in his own mind divest himself of the idea that Miss Tracy had been cruelly wronged, and trusted to time to exonerate her from all blame, whether she remained on earth to rejoice in her ex- culpation, or left the task of a defence of her innocence to her friends. He further made known to Mr. Drayton that Helen was then at his house, and precisely by what chain     320       HELEN COURTENA Y, of events she had arrived there; that her life was despaired of, unless God in his mercy would continue an existence so precious to those interested in her. Helen's ravings were occasionally incoherent, but as often connected and clear. Sometimes she spoke of her child- hood's home, her grotto in the woods, her cousin Frank, her father coming from far lands with beautiful gifts for his child; then she would impersonate her favorite hero. ines of the drama, fascinating Dr. Percival, in spite of her dangerous situation, with the varied gravity or gaiety of her moods; while, running like a thread through every- thing she uttered, was a reference to another, one whom she loved with a passionate affection, a sad wail of sorrow for unreturned devotion, exhausting itself in the tenderest epithets or convulsive spells of weeping. Sometimes she would address Dr. Percival, as he stood by her bedside bathing her burning forehead, with words not meant for him, but for the unknown, whose very name seemed too sacred to be spoken, thrilling him with their tenderness, yet mocking him with their meaningless purport; and, though bearing his cross like a martyr, he could not but wonder who and what he was, who could turn away coldly from such a boon as Helen's love. Very hard was his task of self-control, but very nobly he achieved it, holding deep in his heart her secret, that of a seemingly hopeless passion, and vowing, since she could not be his, to serve her as faithfully, whether the hours of her existence were brief or prolonged, as if she had given him the right to care for her as his own. But at length his watchful guardianship was rewarded. One morning, after a deep and natural sleep, the hour of consciousness came, and though Helen at first was restless in her peculiar position, blushing and reserved at the ap- proach of her kind friend, he was so guarded, so consistent, and mingled the offices of brother and physician so aptly, that she soon became perfectly at ease, and awaited with patience the moment when he should pronounce her fit to attle alone with the realities of life once more. There was to Helen a certain irresistible charm in Dr. Percival's demeanor; he was so unreserved and frank, yet   HELEN COURTENA Y        321 so afraid to offend, that she could not but be grateful for his simplest attention, and glad to feel that his frantic love had changed to the calm interest of friendship. And so it came to pass, that she watched for the hour of his coming as if it were a golden sunset crowning the gloom of a dreary day, implicitly obeyed his directions, and wholly trusted to the changed relation, while she accepted his kindnesses, the rare flowers that he brought, books, engravings, and a thousand nameless and graceful contributions to herself, as though it were her right to be cared for and petted. But, though convalescing, Helen's improvement was so slow, and her frame so debilitated, as sometimes to alarm her physicians, who alternately vibrated between hope and despair as to the result, at one moment thinking that they had conquered the fever which was wasting their patient, but which returned at another again and again to cheat their buoyant hopes. At last, the conflict ending, Helen was enabled to enjoy the refreshment of a drive, being borne to the carriage in Dr. Percival's arms; then to venture languidly on a short walk; next to pass her evenings in the home-like, cosy parlor, in conversation, sewing, or reading, until it became clear to her, and alas! to another, that the time was near at hand for a final departure from her com- fortable haven of rest. Being as yet too weak for much bodily or mental exer- tion, it was an unwelcome task to Helen either to think or act with reference to her future, rejecting, as soon as presented, every plan; as being not altogether feasible. At one time, the place of an assistant in a Parisian Pensionnat seemed to be most desirable; at another, the English de- partment in a German Academy; at another, a situation in England similar to the one she had occupied in Mr. Drayton's family. But all these required letters of recom- mendation, and where were they to be obtained? Certainly not from the Draytons; and since they were friends of Dr. Percival, it would be unjust to the latter, without ac- quainting him with the special cause of her dismissal from Greenwood Seat, to ask them from him. She naturally shrank from relating to him all the particulars, because of their peculiar nature, besides feeling, that in case of re- "*     322       HELEN CO URTENA Y. vealing anything, she would be obliged to include him in Cornelia's indelicate charges; and simply to say that she believed in Cornelia's insanity, without any proofs, would have been unreasonable and futile. After these mental conflicts, poor Helen in her languid state longed that it had been her fate to be the sister of the kind physician, and pictured, in such a case, the golden hours as gliding along like those in fairy-land, she being his only care, as now, and herself contributing to his comfort and happiness by her warm welcome when he returned, wearied, to his home; while devoted to his interests, and watchful in his household, she might cause him to forget the vexations of the outer world: or, since destiny had decreed otherwise, why did not society sanction her remaining with him, with no other tie than that of the friendship they bore, one for the other, so brightening the life of each and calmly floating, as they were then, down the untroubled sea of ex- istence; or since. that, according to received notions, was impracticable, why could she not try to respond to the deep love he had expressed for her, and which she thought, by a little encouragement on her part, might be revived in his breast? Why not be his wife? The silent answer to the last interrogation was ever a beaming blush and a memory of one whose mind and heart were echoes of her own; only, like those in buildings of a certain construction, grander, nobler, more sonorous reverberations than the originating sound. In spite of prayers and vows, silent and out-spoken re. solves, how could she, being so true to a shadowy past, escape being false to another--a reality, were she to give herself into his keeping? While in this dilemma, the arrival of a long and unex- pected letter seemed sent on purpose to relieve her doubts. It was from May, and though filling Helen with sensations of pity and horror, brought to her individual self a feeling of profound gratitude that she was exonerated from all blame in the household where she had been for so long a time an inmate. The words of the letter were the following: "DEAREST M88ss TRACY: We hear that you have been ill, even unto death; and we feel that our treatment of you,   HELEiN CO RTENA Y.       3823 must, in part at least, have br6ught on your serious illness. If it were not for our own griefs, I should dwell more at length on what must have been your sufferings both in mind and body when you found yourself: so entirely deserted by those whom you had supposed to be your friends, but I confess to being selfish, and will reserve this subject for some other period, and that soon, when I trust we shall meet again, and will pass on to the sad events which have oc- curred since your departure. "Soon after you left, our dear Cornelia became reserved and taciturn to an almost painful degree, absenting herself often from home and shunning all companionship, We, at first, thought her wanderings harmless, and imagined that her walks in the quiet, beautiful woods of Greenwood Seat would soothe rather than agitate her in her peculiar moods, while we watched her as we would guard a helpless child. Of this she seemed very impatient, and eluded our espion- age by every art in her power. "In the mean time, my father grew daily more anxious, a heavy weight seeming to press upon him, while he often hinted rather than expressed his fears that Cornelia might become, if she were not already so, insane; though at other times he was disabused of the idea, my sister seemed so calm and free from any aberration of mind. "One day we were walking together in the woods, when she suddenly broke from my detaining arm, and disappeared. I sought her long and anxiously without success, and had at length to return to the castle with the sad intelligence that she could not be found.  My father frantically started out himself in pursuit, and floating upon the little stream spanned by the hawthorn bridge, he saw our darling, drowned. Oh! Miss Tracy, I shall never forget the day when they brought her home; her, my companion, my sister, my friend, my room-mate, so cold and stiff and pale, a corpse. I try to forget, but ever remember the horrible picture, and I dwell upon it now but in justice to yourself. Let me hasten to the end. "At first we hoped and thought that her death was acci- dental; but, on looking in her writing-desk, we found among her papers a letter -directed to my father, in which     324       HELEN COURTENA Y. she writes that she has long wanted to die, and to be rid of this troublous and disappointing existence, where none of her desires had been satisfied, and where everything has seemed to thwart her; that her great want has been a mother's love; and though finding in me large affection, not the highest and best that earth can give, while my father was without the sympathy for which she pined. Then she mentions another, whom she loved with the strong passion of a devoted woman's nature, but meeting only indifference where her heart and soul had been bestowed, she adds that the unknown future, to which she had decided to trust herself, was less to be dreaded than the cold, cheerless present. Concluding this sad list of woes, she continued that though the fact was hidden from others, she was sub- ject to fits of insanity, the worst feature of these being that she was conscious when under the influence of the demon of misrule. "Next follows a list of gifts, as legacies to different per- sons, in which bequests you are not forgotten; and lastly, compensation, as she calls it, to yourself, the only person whom knowingly she has wronged. My poor sister does not attempt to account for her strange mood the night be- fore you left, nor did she herself understand it, being, as she expresses it, half mad and half sane, while she led you to Herbert's door against your will, and displaying a dagger, revealed to you her intention of taking his life, which she was about to do, when you snatched it from her and threw it into the lake, at which time you were nearly crushed to death in her revengeful grasp, all of which agrees with your account left for my father's perusal. Then Cor- nelia goes on to say that the gentleman from whom the information had been obtained of your being an actress, expressed his belief in your perfect purity, and said that all concurred in the idea that you had left the stage to fly from uncongenial associates; that she had asked Mr. Stod- dard, for my sake, and to clear him, too, from any imputa- tion of wrong, for an explanation of the note sent to his apartment, and that he had indignantly defended you, aver- ring that you were above suspicion and were innocence it- self; and, that though he had a secret of yours in his keep-   HELEN COURTENAY.        325 ing, it was nothing against your fair name or fame, as per- haps in the future would be proved to our satisfaction. The other charges, she concludes, if the wicked list can be re- called, bore unmistakably upon them the impress of untruth, and were only false conclusions of her own. "I cannot express to you, dear Miss Tracy, the joy which both my father and myself felt in the midst of a sorrow so peculiarly our own, at your exculpation from all blame, re- joicing that the knowledge of our injustice and your im- plication have not extended beyond ourselves. Fortunately, we have been entirely silent towards Herbert as to the real cause of your absence, merely telling him when he returned' to Greenwood Seat, that your engagement with us was at an end. Perhaps we might have been tempted to reveal to him more, in order to clear ourselves from any suspicions in which he might have indulged as to your abrupt depar- ture, but my father seemed determined to avoid all allusion to the subject, fearing that Cornelia, whose manner was each day becoming wilder and hardetto explain, would be entangled in the matter and condemned. "During this terrible misfortune, which occurred but a few days ago, a rumor reached us, since confirmed, that the vessel in which Mr. Stoddard sailed for America has been lost, with all the passengers and crew. Imagine my double bereavement; my heart is breaking; I am of no earthly use to my father, and like two unhappy spirits, we roam about the house and grounds, having no word, of comfort for each other, for comfort there is none. We both, how- ever, have one wish, one remaining hope, and that is, that you will return to us, pardoning us for all that you have suffered. We feel that your strong, clear judgment can aid us, and bring something like order out of the disorder in our hearts and home. You will forgive us and come; will you not, dear Miss Tracy? Only say yes, and the thought will be a ray of light in our midnight darkness. Your afflicted and contrite "MAY." Yes," said Helen aloud, as she handed her companion the letter, deeming it but right that he should know the     3 26       HELEN COURTENA Y. whole, since she had so impulsively decided to return to Greenwood Seat, after having told him that she had been sent away in disgrace. "Yes, I will go to my poor, deso- late friends." Dr. Percival read the first part of the letter with absorbed interest, feeling keenly the misfortune of Mr. Drayton and May, but when he reached the story of Helen's wrongs, his noble face was disfigured with an expression so dreadful 'that she turned away her eyes from him in fear. Then, after looking over the conclusion, he returned again to the portion alluding to the governess, studying its every word once again with the same forbidding frown, while, as he completed the reperusal, he clenched his hand with pas- sionate force, and uttered through his half-closed teeth a frightful curse, the only curse of a lifetime, upon those who had made her suffer thus; and rising, with hasty strides, as was his wont when agitated, paced the room to and fro. It was painful to see one usually so placid and self-pos- sessed thus moved, Helen scarcely recognising her once tranquil friend in the troubled spirit before her. Arresting him in his hurried walk, she said to him in winning tones: "Will you not take that curse back, Dr. Percival?" But he pursued his way in moody silence, unheeding. "Will you not grant the only favor I have ever asked you?" she pleaded. "I desire to remember you all the days of my life as some one enthroned above me in nobili- ty of soul. Oh, take it back! Recall the curse, and let it not soil your lips, nor taint the surrounding air." Attracted by her earnestness and gentle force, he paused, and laying his hands caressingly upon her glossy hair, smoothed it lightly for a moment, then holding up her face to his gaze, as though it had been that of a child, looked long and seriously into her eyes, sighed, and said with in- expressible tenderness: "Yes, I recall it; anything, everything for your sake. On the whole, it is best for you to leave me, for you are fast becoming my second conscience. We-you and Hwill go to Greenwood Seat to-morrow; the fresh air may bring roses to these pallid, sunken cheeks. I will see you safely, poor weak trembler, to your journey's end."   HELEN COURTENAY.        327 CHAPTER XXV. AFTER gifts and thanks, and an affectionate adieu to kind Mrs. Dearing, Helen set out the next day, no more a lonely pilgrim, for Greenwood Seat. The drive was a silent one, her companion wisely leaving her to her own meditations, knowing that the pure free air, the lull compared with the Babel of London, and the influence of nature, were better for her than the most interesting interchange of speech. In her quiet mood Helen was not idle, but thinking deeply upon a subject near her heart-namely, a letter which she had written to Stephen Gerald, the machine-man of the law, some time before she had been dismissed from the Draytons' household, and to which' she now reasonably expected an answer. Had she said enough in it? Had shd said too little? Was it too plain, or too obscure? Weakened as she was by her severe sickness, and morbidly dwelling upon its contents, it was hard for her to decide whether the communication was worded as it should have been or not, and this the reader will determine for her, after perusing the following copy of her missive: "DEAR FRIEND (for friend I must call one who has for nearly four years so conscientiously and wisely administered to the wishes and interests of a lone orphan)-the time draws near when we, in our business relations, must part: but be- fore that hour arrives, let me give you a brief account of the reasons for admitting you but half way into my confidence heretofore, and asking you to continue, for a few months longer, your valuable aid and counsel in my behalf. "You are not aware, in addition to the yearly stipend which for so many years you have paid to Edward Lee, the person now designated under the name of Herbert Drayton, that his father bequeathed to him a large fortune, but with a few restrictions which I will name. Mr. Lee left to his' nearest and dearest friend, my father, the whole amount of his property, the interest of which was to be his own, with the exception of the above-mentioned stipend, until his son     328       HELEN COUID'TENA Y. Edward should attain the age of twenty-eight years, when, under certain conditions, the property was to revert to this,  his only child, his heirship being entirely kept from his  knowledge. In case of my father's death his heir or heiress  were to enjoy the interest of the property until the time specified for it to be returned in bulk to Edward Lee. I  will further inform you that this fortune is only to revert to young Lee in case, by his own exertions, he has placed or  can place himself in a position to be independent without additional aid. Should he be unworthy of it, or should he die before the aforesaid age, the amount is to be devoted to  some institution of charity. "I find, upon inquiry, that the said Edward Lee, now  Herbert Drayton, is in every way worthy the bequest, and  that he will attain his twenty-eighth year on the first day of the coming December.  "To go back a little. You know, dear sir, that my father's large heart and luxurious tastes, together with his residence  for so many years abroad, made him more lavish of money than perhaps it was prudent to be. Had he lived longer, no doubt he would have left ample provision for this debt of honor, but as he did not, it became incumbent on me to make good this property. Nothing then remained but to inquire into my resources, tax every nerve and energy to supply the deficiency, and so manage my own property, left me without restriction by my grandfather, as, at the appointed time, to have it equal, what now, plainly, is my debt. "This, thanks to you, I have achieved, besides paying from my own earnings the income due to the young heir. 1 would not enter into these particulars at the time of my father's death, because dreading that some one might oppose me in my scheme. I feared interference, I hated the publicity that might attend upon my actions, but now, after so long an exile from my native land, when the grief, coldness, and indignation of my friends are exchanged for indifference, when my name is almost forgotten, or, if re- membered, a matter of very little moment to me, since my self-sustained and varied life has made me less diffident; should the exposure come, I can bear the talk of the world.   HELEN COURTENA Y.        329 But of this I see no necessity, since the caution and se- cresy of a few might easily prevent it.  "Two of the witnesses of Mr. Lee's extraordinary will were living at the time of my father's death. These, by the terms of the testament, were to present themselves on the appointed day, to claim from my father or his heirs the property for which they, in a measure, are in trust, their only part of the arrangement being that they were sworn to silence, confiding in the honor of our house to fulfil the en- gagement. "Below I give you the London address of said Herbert Drayton. You will please notify him, in time, that some- thing of importance calls him to your office in New Orleans, on the first of December next. "And now, let me thank you again and again for all your kindness, forbearance, and promptness; your reticence as regards my affairs, your ready acquiescence in writing to me at different times under feigned names, and your skilful management of my funds. Our business relations, as I said before, will close at the end of this year, but friendly feel- ings will ever exist for you in the heart of your obliged and grateful          HELEN COURTENAY." Helen's welcome at Greenwood Seat was earnest but subdued, the shadow of their recent hour of gloom still hanging over its inmates. Mr. Drayton, though rejoiced to see his valued friend at first, relapsed soon after to that dull apathy that comes to the mind missing what has been an object of regard in the past, while May was so devoid of all interest in what was transpiring around her, so dejected and depressed, that she resembled one whose principle of life had departed, and who moved like an automaton with- out plan or purpose; her unnatural state, in its turn, acting most unfavorably upon her father. Though our heroine felt an inward pleasure at being entirely cleared from the smallest particle of blame; know-. ing, too, that she was needed and appreciated, it was with no triumphant spirit that she returned to the spot from whence she had been banished. Enervated by her late sickness, and wearied with the journey, Dr. Percival almost     330       tELEN COVRtEI  A Y. lifted her into the house, while the independent, springing step with which she had left it, was exchanged for the laln- glid gait characteristic of an invalid. Besides, she, too, mourned, though in secret, for Frank's unexpected loss. At first she had not believed the intelligence, and it made no greater impression upon her than the memory of a dream; but now, since in the very presence of her pupil's double grief, it came home to her in the shape of a severe shock, knowing likewise that an effort must be made to control her own sense of bereavement while trying to comfort May. Though Frank had been absent from her for so liany years, yet the pang accompanying the idea of never s eeing him more, was not the less poignant, and Helen mourned for her cousin, her last of kin, in the silence of her own heart, his generous, ardent disposition, his cheerfulness, his un- tiring kindness to herself; and appreciated fully, now -that he was beyond recall, the nature that had been willing to sacrifice this fresh, strong love for May, to the old dead bond of the past. Then how much, through her deep sympathy for the lovers, did she suffer! How short-lived had been their betrothal, that happiest of life's happy joy-time; that gala- feast, when existence is bounded with rainbow hues; when the minutes fly on swift pinions, and cares have not yet come to disappoint and annoy; when a single thought, the thought of being beloved, is enough to fill the heart, to overflowing, and the future, present, and past, have refer- ence to one, singled out from all others. When dull prose is transmuted into poetry, and the everyday sun is a kiss of fire on the lips of half opened flowers; the twilight a dream-time, as the light fades away like music, distant and more distant, or the vanishing gleam of a sail at sea; and Night, the hour when the winds whisper the loves of the stars, and evening descends like the slumberous fall of an ebon-fringed eyelid, or I As a feather is wafted downward From an eagle in its flight." Neither was Herbert's demeanor calculated to calm and soothe Helen,-she would have preferred indifference on his   -BELE' O URTENYA .        331 part to the intense and uncontrollable expression of inter- est, not unmixed with curiosity,' with which he, followed her slightest movement. Nor was he unconscious of his ab- sorption, priding himself upon the motive which inspired him, and imagining that during his absence he had schooled his heart into obedience, which enabled him to study her case in the manner of a physician, or like a physiologist, to detect causes and results in the wreck which a few weeks had made,-her shadowy figure, her solemn aspect, her helpless air, her old self etherealized, yet human still, in a strangely fascinating phase. And in truth Helen was a picture from which it was hard to withdraw one's eyes; her hair was combed back from her marble brow, whose whiteness was threaded at the temples with blue veins interlaced; her lips were without their usual peculiar redness; her hands had lost their beau- tiful proportions, and seemed spiritualized, like the hands of some fair, fasting saint, while she breathed long, unconscious sighs of weakness, pain, or hidden grief, like the sad whis- pers of the breeze in some lonely and desolated forest glade. But the chief change was in her eyes, no longer quick and intelligent with the motion of strong health, but large, luminous, and grave, expressive of the languor pervading her whole mental and physical state, and it was almost be- yond endurance to those whom she loved to have their full force turned towards them, so sad, so tender, so full of suffering was their mute regard. Dr. Percival never for a moment relaxed in his quiet attentions to Helen, and even when apparently not watch- ing her, had her welfare in his mind, gratifying some unex- pressed wish, arranging a cushion for her feet, placing her chair in a comfortable position, screening her from a blaze of light, and performing those myriad nameless attentions which are so grateful to the convalescing invalid, who has the desire but not the. strength to be independent. And Herbert regarded these attentions with observant mien, nor could he be blind to Helen's appreciation of them, or the almost loving glances of her languid eyes upon her physi- cian friend, his old surmise returning, that his was the name that had so agitated her in the study-room scene; in fact,     332      HELEN CO RTENA Y. the idea seemed to glide into certainty as every hour pro- gressed; and yet, poor deluded mortal that he felt himself to be, the old charm of her presence was winding itself once more inextricably around him, even though feeling that she was pledged irrevocably to another, besides remem- bering her duplicity and falseheartedness in endeavoring to beguile May's affianced, and to number him among her conquests. Thus after two quiet and comparatively happy days at Greenwood Seat, Dr. Percival's visit came to a termination. He had prescribed change of climate and scene for May, and was rejoiced that her father acceded so readily to his views, especially since they included Helen, to whom he knew that the bracing mountain air which he recommended would bring health, and that her body and mind would be invigorated by the scenes to which he pointed Mr. Dray- ton's steps. To the question of the latter: "We have been everywhere; where shall we go?"Dr. Percival replied: "Yes, everywhere for the cultivation of the intellect; to France for her libraries and battle-fields; to Spain for her convents and palaces; to Germany for her music and belles-lettres; to Italy for her architecture, paintings, and sculpture; and to Greece for her associations with the past. Even the far East has seen you wandering amid her pyra- mids; all, all feeding the mind; go now to seek nature, and have a care of the body; make yourself a quiet resting-place in some Alpine valley, and there for a while, face to face with what God has made, tranquillity will return to your child, who needs excitement, not the excitement of books or people, but constant exercise and a life out of herself." Never had Dr. Percival given a prescription in such lengthened terms; but a change for May being imperative, and for Helen advisable, Mr. Drayton, feeling the truth of what had been said, made arrangements at once for the journey. But to return to the physician. He was about to leave her to whom he had almost become a necessity; Helen was to be severed from that untiring, faithful friend. To part.; taking these words in their deepest acceptation, and attach- ing to them their broadest meaning, she was conscious of a   HELEN CO URTENA .        333 blank in the future in the place of a loving, breathing form; a void instead of a kind, affectionate, tone; a cessation of sympathy in earth's every-day, common things, that make up so much of the pleasure and pain of existence. To part; gone I In her heart of hearts she felt the solemn force of the fact, and experienced a sense of loneliness at the thought that gave her the forsaken sensation of a momentary despair. The appointed time was at hand, and Dr. Percival rose to say " good-by." He was not a man of many words, and the cordial grasp of his hand stood in lieu of the graceful acknowledgments so easy for others to gie, for the pleasant interlude in his busy London life, where kindest attentions, green fields, and purling brooks had refreshed his worn spirit. To each of the circle he had bidden adieu, leaving Helen for the last. His farewell to her was like that to the rest, only that, perchance, his hand lingered an instant longer in her little, wasted palm; then he turned away without a word. But as he reached the door, he-felt a light touch upon his arm, and turning, confronted his friend's governess. She had gathered her whole strength for this. "Our parting, how cold it was!" she said, tremblingly; "how could I so part from one to whom I owe prosperity, friends, health, life! I ought to have said so much, and yet uttered so little. Dearfriend," she continued, taking both his hands within her own, "forgive me; the words will not come as they should; but oh! if you could only see into my heart, you would find yourself and gratitude written there." For a moment he looked down with swimming eyes, for he was tall of stature, into her upturned face, glanced from her to the others, and then to her again, making his mean- ing, which was unmistakable, to be plainly interpreted: "She has need of your care, oh, care for her," said the appealing look; then hastily brushing away traces of feeling so unusual, he bent over Helen, murmured a parting, blessing in her ear, and returned to his duties and his unblessed, lonely home. O.     334       HELEN COURTENA Y CHAPTER XXVI.* BY rapid, but not weary stages, the party from Greenwood Seat, consisting of Mr. Drayton, May, and Helen, reached their destination, the canton of Schweitz, in the very heart of the loftiest Alps. The beautiful lakes of Zug and Lowertz lay in calm and sleeping beauty beneath them, while the mountains of Rigi and Rossberg towered grandly skywards, fleckered with an ever-changeful network of light and shade, emblems of the inconstancy of life; while the last, Rossberg, was covered, even to its summit, with greenness and fertility. Ill daily sight, too, like stars in blue heavens, in the bosom of the lake of Lowertz, shone the hermit-island of the monks of Einsideln, and the little circle of land crowned with the ruined chateau of the house of Hapsburg. Thus everything breathed of stillness and rest, until the breasts of those who sought the delicious retreat, reflected something of their surroundings, and felt the blessed benison of peace. Though other villages overlooked this scene of mirrored loveliness, Mr. Drayton determined to fix his abode in that of Lowertz, as being the most attractive for its social life, the happy and contented look of its inhabitants, for a view of the pretty church tower that rose in clear relief against the mountain background, and lastly for a woman's reason, because his daughter and her governess had taken a fancy to the enchanting panorama of the neighborhood. It was with emotions almost of satisfaction, that Helen and May gazed from the windows of their new habitation, shared with the family of a chamois-hunter, upon the pros- pect which they appropriated as peculiarly their own-the lake, dotted with its two mystic islands, the gliding to and fro of fairy boats propelled by women in picturesque garb, keeping time to the stroke of their oars in German song; the imposing front of the Rigi chain, traversed by forests of pine; the cattle, with the clang of their musical bells, * To Simond's Travels and Buckminster's Letters, the author is indebted for the facts, and in some cases the language, contained in a few of the following chapters, where the scene is laid in Switzerland   HELEN CO URTENAY.         335 grazing in the pastures, many of which were belted by lines of snow; or listened to the wild and melancholy Ranz des Vaches echoing along the mountain paths. Then lower in the valley gleamed luxuriant fields and meadows, and plea- sant homes, shaded with walnut and fig-trees, breathing of plenty and contentment. Nor were the domestic arrangements where the lot of our travellers had fallen less in contrast to their English castle home than the outer world, or less to be enjoyed and appreciated, because so different. The mistress of the house, the young chamois-hunter's wife, presented a per- petual moving picture, with her handsome face, her neat form arrayed in the costume of her country, her plaited hair fastened with an antique gilt brooch, short, brown petticoats, red socks, and stays of the same color laced coquettishy with black braid across her bosom; while her infant, the pet of the household and the admiration of May, grouped with the mother, enacted unconsciously a series of delightful tableaux for the benefit of the foreign inmates. The house itself was spacious and scrupulously clean, the first floor being built of stone ; the others, where Mr. Dray- ton, May, and Helen were domiciled, of larch, with project- ing roofs and galleries, the high, pointed gable ends being finished with windows which commanded a fine view of the surrounding country, and were overhung by the universal protection of pine shingles secured by heavy stones. When the weather proved stormy, Mr. Drayton sought the loved companionship of his books, while Helen and May made the nearer acquaintance of their pretty hostess, assisting her in her household tasks, manipulating, with white hands, the thrifty churn, or taking lessons in embroi- dery and tambour-work, surprised and delighted at the results of their industry. Thus the entire newness of her in-door and out-door life weaned May, in a measure, from the constant thought of the old griefs, or taught her to regard her troubles as a part of the discipline of life which it was best for her to bear with patience. Sometimes the chamois-hunter lent life to the quaint "interior," and, returning from some perilous excursion,     336       HELEN CO URTENA Y. cntertained the interested circle with his wondrous tales; while May congratulated herself upon her lately acquired knowledge of German, as it enabled her to follow him in his graphic descriptions given in that language, the common tongue of the peasantry around. The hunter was as remarkable for manly beauty as was his wife for prettiness, but stalwart, hardy, and accustomed to every kind of privation in the exercise of his calling, loving the peril for the peril's sake, and as much at home on the brink of a precipice as his wife was in her well ordered household. May found her apathy forsaking her, and her cheek kindling like his own, as the humble but romantic-looking hero told his experiences, and described his patiently lying in wait for game, for hours, with hoe in hand, cutting steps in the ice for a sure footing, armed with his rifle and a stick with a point of iron; while in his pouch he carried a supply of barley-cakes and brandy, his only sustenance for days, and last, but not least, his inseparable spy-glass. Or, she warmed with something of his own enthusiasm as he painted his excitement and disappoint- ment, when, after remaining with some companions motion- less in the snow for almost an entire day, and being sure of their prey, a splendid herd of chamois who were just ready, as it seemed, to fall into their hands, the creatures, catching sight and scent of the hunters, and preferring suicide to death from man, rushed down a precipice to cer- tain destruction, sometimes leaping twenty feet and poising themselves on the smallest projection of a rock, as if tempt- ing their pursuers, though far out of range of their rifles, to waste powder and shot in a useless effort to take their lives. Then, seeing May's increasinginterest in his recital, he would tell her tales of the lammergeyer that attacks the chamois for a subsistence, hurling them headlong down the steeps with its powerful wings, then descending at leisure to feed upon their flesh; or he would bring sympathizing tears to her eyes by dwelling upon the dangers incurred by the hunter, whose life hangs by a single thread, snapping without a minute's warning as he takes a false step on some jagged mountain peak. When thus recounting his adventures, the young mother's   HELEN COURTENA .         337 troubled look would silently beseech him to leave a theme so harrowing, and May longed to sketch the charming group as he sometimes bent tenderly over her, while the baby hands of the little one played caressingly with his wavy hair, the father speaking words of comfort to his gen- tle and timid wife: "Fear. not- for me, dearest; I bear a charmed life with you for my guardian angel." This blending of reality and romance, and the delicious freedom of their life, became very fascinating to the health- seeking exiles,- who soon felt at home even amid scenes so new and strange. Often with the help of a guide they rode to lofty heights on the mules of the country, that were shod in a particular manner to ascend the mountain sides, and trained for such gentle service; while May's returning strength gave to her fresh vivacity, and brought the roses once more in deeper flush upon her Saxon face. To the delight of her father, who only lived in the happiness of his child, she soon became a favorite among the guides, who entertained her with legends of the Alps, accounts of the fall of rocks carrying ruin and desolation in their course stories of travellers buried under snow-drifts, or with tales eloquent with truth, of their immortal William Tell. Now and then May would capriciously fancy a flower, blooming upon some apparently inaccessible point, and spite of the seeming impossibility of procuring it, in a few minutes it was in her possession, placed there by one of the intrepid group, who, holding on with hands, feet, or teeth, or bounding like a chamois from rock to rock, or hanging poised between heaven and earth at the peril of his life, had secured the coveted prize. On one occasion, in their mountain climbing, they en- countered one of those sudden storms that inspire the beholder with terror, admiration, or awe, acting differently upon different casts of character, as was seen exemplified in the cases of May and Helen; for, while the former' childishy clapped her hands in glee at the wild beauty of the scene, as if the elements were only sporting roughly for her amusement, Helen was moved to the very soul by its grand  sublimity. In, every direction hung- vapors wreathed and floating like cloud drapery, the mountain-tops 15     338       HELEN COURTENAY. seeming to grow darker in contrast with their pearly white; the lammergeyer flew hither and thither on errands of death; the chough's shrill, wild cries sounded like voices from another world; the thunder pealed in unending rever- berations, while the lightning played in deadly sport among the trees. This riot of nature was followed by a stillness so intense, a hush so impressively awful, that a whisper seemed loud-voiced. The guide, on the first approach of the tempest, hurried our party to seek a shelter, and in a hidden chalet in one of the rudest passes of the mountains they found the hos- pitality and security so much needed, looking down upon the storm-clouds, and above the fury of the wind and sleet. Here, too, they inscribed their names, as many another tra- veller had done; and here, as Helen turned over the pages of the record, the characters of a name, the sight of which she thought could never more stain her cheek with crimson as she beheld it, or cause her hand to tremble, made her feel conscious how deeply she was agitated by the simple incident, that hope long, pray as she would, the task of trying to forget was vain. The solemn roll of the thunder, the bare summits of gra- nite that rose around them, the snow-clad tops of the higher Alps looming up like frozen clouds, their isolation from the under world, made them long with a sense of desolateness for the chamois-hunter's roof; and when the danger was overpast, glad were they to descend once more, with this fresh leaf in their page of experience, to the valley, where awaiting them anxiously on the threshold, stood the gentle wife to give them a welcome home. Home! The sweetest word in all the vocabulary of words. A note of music in the world's discord. The prince's crown-jewel. The peasant's brightest star. The sailor's memory. The soldier's hope. The traveller's prayer. The child's bow of promise. The wife's kingdom. The hus- band's reward. The old man's rest. A shelter for the new born. A retreat for the dying. A priceless boon for all! Thus thought Helen, realizing the value of her temporary abode, while she thanked God for so cheerful a haven from the visible storms of life.   HELEN COURTENAY.        339 CHAPTER XXVII. NOT long after the events recorded in the last chapter, Helen again looked forth from her favoriteVindow upon the ever. varying pictures to be seen from thence, but the view on that occasion was not brightened by sunlight, but clouded by cheerlessness and gloom. It was early in September, and an incessant rain poured into the ruffled waters of the lake. From the Rossberg and the Rigi, the sunny and shady mountains of Zug, came tor- rents of rushing water, while the head of Mount Pilatus was encircled by a fierce coronal of angry clouds. The chamois-hunter's wife and child, together with Mr. Drayton and May, had been absent for two or three days, attending a fair at a neighboring village, leaving Helen, who preferred to remain under the roof and in the care of the kind pastor, whose house adjoined their own at Lowertz. Taking advantage of a lull in the storm, Helen had re- crossed to her late abode, intending to remain uhere until night-fall, in writing, reading, or musing, as best suited her mood. She longed for the return of Mr. Drayton and May, the bright genial housewife, and her engaging child, who had remained away a greater time than contemplated, on account of the continuous rains; and though the pastor and his family were devoted and kind to the young stranger, since denied her accustomed companionships, she desired, at least for a few hours, to be in solitude. Alone I Sweet privilege for wearied or mourning, or even joyous hearts. Who would never be alone? Never live over in mute retrospection the blessed past? Never recall in the silence a tender word? Never whisper, unheard by others, a loved one's name? Never weep tears, unseen, of pleasure-- or of pain? Never, with clasped arms, enfold some imagi- nary form? Never utter a prayer meant only to be heard by God? As Helen stood listlessly gazing from the window, she suddenly heard sounds ominous of evil, as though the moun- tain of Rossberg had been given a voice, and was uttering complainings in groans and lamentations, while stones at     340       HELEN C URTENAY.              I its base started from the ground, large fragments of rock rolled down its sides, and birds flew screaming to and fro, scared from their hiding-places and bewildered with affright. Our heroine was not alarmed by these phenomena, only awed, thinking that the unusual commotion in nature might portend some occurrence common to that latitude; but soon her apathy and enjoyment of the wild magnificence of the view were turned to dread, and personal fears for her own safety, as a huge projection of the mountain seemed torn away by the invisible hands of giants, and came crashing down towards the lake. At this moment, she heard her name called by the pas- tor's voice, and its tone of agonized entreaty told her, at once, that some terrific danger was at hand. That some- thing was to be done for self-preservation, something to be rescued from ruin, was her first thought; and as the fatal bounds of the falling mountain became at every instant more appalling, shaking the house to its foundation, and moving her like a reed in the wind, terror lent speed to her steps, while she rushed to the adjoining apartment to pos- sess herself of the portfolio containing her letters and papers of value. Downwards came the descending mass, as if an upper world had been rent in twain and was pouring its contents into the heart of the doomed village, carrying trees, rocks, houses, everything before it, with a resistless sweep, and then with one formidable leap plunging into the dimpled bosom of the lake. To Helen, the interval of suspense and mental agony seemed a cycle, but only four minutes according to the esti- mate of those near the scene elapsed, since, breaking from the mother rock, the huge mass was precipitated below. How much of bliss or woe, how much that is momen- tous, may be comprehended in that little space of time! Four minutes have ushered into life a new birth; closed for ever dying eyes; joined in one, two willing hearts; brought to the gambler fortune or bankruptcy; discovered a mine of gold; flashed into light from dark places a price- less diamond; washed ashore a pearl worth a kingdom; showed to the weary mariner a new continent; startled the   HELEN C 0URTENAY.        341 patient astronomer by the sight of a hidden planet; frosted over a fair field with untimely snows; converted the em- bryo thought into a sinful act, or made it worthy of a smile from Heaven; doubled the amount of crime in the wicked man's register of evil; hardened the impenitent; brought tears of contrition to the erring; created an angel or a demon; turned the tide of war into victory or defeat; doomed the convict or innocent to imprisonment for life; opened wide dungeon gates; given birth to an idea ema- nating from a poet's brain that will live through the ages; wiped out from the remembrance of man the intellectual labor of years; registered a deluding, lie, proclaimed an undying truth; quenched the light of reason, or restored the clouded mind to sanity; brought success or failure, tears or smiles, hope or despair; moulded a murderer; saved a man from temptation, or plunged him into the deeps of guilt; led a mortal to the very gates of heaven, or hurled him into the seething fires of hell. Helen, having secured her papers, was conscious of a shock as of an earthquake, and an intense darkness coming down like an instantaneous night. Groping to the door, she found it close shut, and refusing to be opened by all the strength she could bring to bear upon it; then feeling her way with outstretched hands, she passed on, in turn, to each window, only to discover that it was blocked up with an impenetrable barrier of earth and stones. As this for- lorn truth was made apparent, our heroine's self-possession forsook her; and in unavailing regrets for having left for a moment the shelter of the pastor's roof, in moaning, weep- ing, and screaming, trying every avenue of exit in vain, kneeling in frantic prayer, pacing to and fro within the narrow limits like a newly-caged creature of the wilds, she spent the precious moments. At length, ashamed of her helplessness, she determined, in a more womanly and less childish spirit, to try by every possible means to extricate herself from her present difficulty; but in this pause of self- commune, and as if in echo to her own piercing cries, she heard wails of pain, fierce utterings of agony, that only heightened her own despair, and recalled the fearful tales of villages buried, in that region, beneath falling masses of     342        IELEN COURTENA Y. mountain rocks; then, while her thought leaped at once to the dreadful conclusion that she, too, was thus entombed  in a living burial, a sensation of suffocation, a dizziness like that she had once before experienced overcame her, and she sank upon the floor unconscious, in blessed ignorance of her  frightful fate. CHAPTER XXVIII. IT was but a few days after Mr. Drayton's departure from Greenwood Seat that Herbert noticed a marked change in the hitherto almost torpid state of the elder brother. His lethargy fell from him as though it had been a garment, his eyes brightened, past memories came thronging upon him, and his tongue was loosened to talk of the "good old times." Heretofore Herbert had been the entertainer, now he was the entertained. His aged friend reverted inces- santly to the days of his boyhood, and became eloquent in recounting his daring feats of yore; or he pictured his sea- son of love, his voice growing tender as he told of the per-  fcctions of her who had won him, not alone for the pas- sionate season of youth, but for all after-time on earth and in eternity; or he dwelt upon the joyful birth of his boy, and his fresh, glad emotions of fatherly pride. Ig- noring all that was gloomy, he only touched upon the sunny spots of his existence, illuminated by the golden tints of happiness. To use the common, worn, but apt simile, the decaying lamp flamed out in new brilliancy once more before it was darkened for ever. Herbert watched these signs with trembling, for though he knew they were symptoms of a most happy change for his kind and pure-hearted companion, still he was loath to part with one to whom he owed so much, and who, in turn, leaned so fondly upon him in his helplessness. One night these by-gone memories seemed more busy than usual, and even after he had retired for the night, Herbert remained with him listening patiently to his oft-   HELEN COURTENA.         343 repeated tales. Presently the old man slept, and his young attendant sat silently musing upon his own individual in- terests, his morning hours of labor, Cornelia's fearful death, May's dual sorrow, and with quickened heart-beats, of Helen, whom he found it impossible to separate from him- self, but thinking of her as one thinks of the "Might have been;" that unending wail of regret which ofills daily and hourly the universal heart of poor humanity, making lives that could have been so blest, barren-a shell without its pearl, a cave riled of its glittering gems, a sky without stars, earth without its vesture of green verdure, a body without its gift of mind. ", erbert," he heard Mr. Drayton say, and in a moment he was standing by his bedside; "Herbert, are you sure that she does not love you,-Helen, I mean . h"I am sure," was the answer, with a mingled expression of sorrow and hauteur. "Ah, well," returned the old man, "I, at least, appreci- ate you; you will realize this better when I have gone; for I have kept my word, and have left you all." So saying, his eyes closed languidly and again he slept, while the young heir, in no wise congratulating himself at his enrichment at the expense of parting with so true a? friend, stood watching him earnestly. His silk-white hair waved over a lofty brow; his aspect was singularly calm and benevolent; his whole appearance like that of one who, in suffering and struggling mentally, has won the place of a moral conqueror. As Herbert tenderly looked upon him, hoping that his life of self-denial would find compensation in the "better land," a bright smile suddenly played around the beautiful but pallid lips. "I am coming," they said softly, as if in answer to some spirit-voice; then sighing deeply, he obeyed the longed-for summons. Oh, blessed, blessed death, he had passed onward to the presence of those he loved so well! It was hard to realize it, but the truth that his work was finished came to Herbert at last. No regrets of duties un- performed, of cold words or looks, or neglect, mingled with his grief; and assisted by his neighbors and friends, he bore     544       HELEN COURTENA Y. the world-weary one to his last resting-place. His brother having been made acquainted with his death by letter, and the sad rites being completed, after the reading of the will, in which, as Mr. Drayton had intimated, he was left sole heir to the property of the deceased, Herbert proceeded at once to London, where it was invested, to inquire into the condition of his inheritance. Farewell to all his dreams of independence! Farewell to the pursuit of knowledge, to the investigations of science except as a task! Farewell to many a scheme for the good of mankind, which could only be perfected by one having elegant leisure at his command! The investment, apparently so safe, had proved in the hands of speculators a losing one, which fact had been pur- posely kept from Mr. Drayton and Herbert; nor could there be any redress or compensation in the matter. Regrets on Herbert's part were unavailing, since what had occurred wes i evocable; all that remained for him was to gather up his energies, shake off all memory of his past careless exist- ence, and plod, as many another did, on the road which he hoped might lead, if not to fortune, at least to competency. While considering, with the whole world before him, in what portion of it to commence his work, a letter was handed to him superscribed in an unknown handwriting. Breaking the seal, he found that it contained a few sim- ple but imperative words from one Stephen Gerald, New Orleans, Louisiana, saying that some important valuable information would be unfolded to him at the office of the writer, at noon on the first day of the coming December, and requesting his presence there at the specified time. With no tie to bind him, as pliant as a leaf in the breeze, and somewhat careless as to his future, except in a resolve to be independent of others, Herbert determined to answer the letter in person, though with an incredulous spirit as to any benefits to be conferred on him by so singular and mys- terious a summons. But would it be right, kind, or considerate to leave the Draytons, perhaps for ever, without a personal acknowledg- ment of their many courtesies? And when this question was answered in the negative, a second arose: In seeking   ItELEN COURTENA Y.        345 to bid them farewell, should he not have the joy of behold- ing another also-the siren-spirit that, present or absent, lured him to recogniselher existence, and could not, would not be ignored? With the same recklessness which had possessed him since the revelation concerning the property, he determined to set off immediately for Lowertz, knowing the very spot, as described in Mr. Drayton's letters, where they were re- siding, remembering the chamois-hunter and his handsome betrothed, and the pastor's hospitable home, besides having experienced his kindness when on a visit to the Alpine re- gions for geological researches, a short time before Helen's first coming to Greenwood Seat. As it was but the work of a few hours to act upon his decision, the next day found him en route for Switzerland. Business obliged him to stop a short period at Paris. Not for him were the Boulevards, the theatres, the thousand at- tractive sights and sounds; he was living, just then, within a world of his own, and cared to admit into it nothing but the present duty of the hour-the thought of his' coming journey, and the farewell that would follow close upon it. Ordering a meal at a restaurant, he was listlessly await- ing its appearance, when two gentlemen entered the long salon, and seating themselves at a table near his, made the same demand upon a waiter in attendance. They appeared to have met by appointment, and to have been long-parted friends. Herbert was conscious of no breach of etiquette or intru- sion in listening to their conversation; in fact, as they were the latest comers, and had chosen seats near him, not deign- ing to notice his presence, or oblivious of it, he was even against his will an eavesdropper, not especially interested except in the leading features of what was transpiring at the time, though afterwards minutely recalling every word. "Friendship has its penalties as well as its charms," said one, after expressing his delight at the meeting; " and the terms of that Will bind us like slaves." "Yes," returned the other, " we are obliged, it is true, to be there at the specified time. The infant boy, by the by, is an adult now; and this reminds me that Time, which 15*     346       HELEN COURTENAPY. has carried him from childhood to manhood, has likewise  brought us far onward in the journey of life, and not dis- tant from the great reckoning. Being true to that includes being faithful to our friends and ourselves; we must see that the lad has his just rights." "Though I have lost sight of him," returned the other, "I have kept my eye somewhat upon his interests, even though the terms of the will required and expected nothing of us, save our names as witnesses, and our presence at the necessary hour. It was left to Courtenay's honor, you re- member, and that of his heirs, to carry out the plan. Now Courtenay, you know, died about four or five years ago, and it devolved upon his only child, a daughter, to complete the programme. This daughter," he continued, " inherited from her grandfather a large fortune. Strange to say, at her father's death, and much to the wonder and chagrin of her friends, she left her home and wealth and became an actress. Now, with my old habit of coming to just con- clusions strong upon me, I am inclined to believe the girl discovered that her father had run through the property in- trusted to him, for everybody knows that Courtenay was a fast liver, and to save his memory from the stigma of a breach of trust, she will substitute her own property in the place of that squandered by him, gaining her livelihood by her own exertions." "If this be the case," returned the second speaker, " she must be a noble woman, and worthy a better fate. How few of her sex would sacrifice for an idea the comforts of home, a fortune, position, and friends, for those fickle goddesses, Popularity and Success!" "Noble, indeed!" replied his companion, " because her exceeding great reward must only be in her own conscious- ness of well-doing. Even if my surmises are right, they are only surmises; we have nothing to do with her self- sacrifice; it must be to us as if it had not been. Our plain course is simply to see that the heir has his inheritance. Besides, to breathe any suspicion of what I think, and per- haps mistakenly, she has done, would be to mar her plot and taint the honor of her father. We cannot act too cau- tiouslv in the matter."   HELEN COURTENAY.        347 "As soon," was the answer, "as we have enjoyed Paris together a little, we will turn our faces homeward." Herbert arose, haying finished his meal, and quietly' de- parted; but a vision kept floating in his mind of a lovely maiden in gossamer robes, dancing to the measure of soft music, a smile upon her face, but a sorrow in her heart, un- seen by all the applauding crowd. Then it changed to a laughing girl, the muse of comedy, bringing down peals of laughter from a critical audience, while behind the scenes she dashed away her tears or breathed the saddest sighs, when remembering the poverty of her lonely home, and whv she was there, a plaything for the public. And again there stood before him a tragedy queen, with mournful eyes, bowing with finished grace to her admirers, but in the si- lence of midnight, when no longer playing a part, steeped in the very misery and agony she had so successfully portrayed. To which of these three ranks did the heroine of the strangers belong? Viewed by the light of duty, the soul of one so circum- stanced, seemed to Herbert crystal-clear; not in this wise had he ever considered an actress before, nor could he divest himself of the impression left upon him by the chance words that he had heard. Do what he would, it fastened upon him; and though remembering his sweeping denunciation of the whole class, he found himself echoing the very sentiment that he had heard: "A noble woman, truly." Under what skies did that generous, self-denying maiden abide? Herbert was becoming strangely interested in her, the outlines of whose shadowy picture he filled in his own imagining. High-minded, delicately reared, but true to her loftiest light, her watchword a parent's honor; where was she now?  What obscure attic narrowed in her lofty spirit? What beaten track, from her lowly abode to the scene of her mighty labors, did her patient feet follow- those willing, untiring feet once cushioned in luxurious ease? And then what conflicts must have been hers in stepping from the veiled sanctuary of home to the public boards of a theatre, the only occupation forwhich she was fitted by education and circumstances, since her white 12     dainty hands were all unused to the drudgery of menial toil i Comparing her task with his own, her disappointment her trials, with his, he felt ashamed to have yielded for a moment to despondency; nay, he eVen desired her better acquaintance, to feel the gentle dew of her sympathy shed upon him, to sit at her feet learning lessons of courage and self-abnegation; but ah, not to see her forced artificial life; to behold her smiling, when her heart was breaking--. would be to move even his stoic eyes to tears. Every young andcareworn face passing him on his way, won from him a look of interest and reverence, as he thought that each countenance, so marked, might be that of the daughterly child. Night came, and the vision took the shape of a dream, the danseuse pointing mockingly at him with her graceful, taper finger; the child of mirth laughing him to scorn; the Melpomene sweeping by him with mystic indignation; all designating him as the unfair denunciator of The Actress.  Thus in panoramic procession they passed untiring, until the waking hour, when all memory of the conversation in the restaurant and its attendant train of thought was lost (ah, how easy is it to forget!), until--- But the reader may be averse to anticipating. CHAPTER XXIX. IT was early on the day succeeding the terrible descent of the Spitzberg, the name of the projection which fell from the Rossberg, that Herbert neared the scene of desolation and ruin. Landing at the little town of Art, at the southern nxtremity of the lake of Zug, he sought, skirting along the vestern boundaries of the ruins by the side of Mount Rigi, he once smiling lake of Lowertz. And where, he anxiously asked himself, where were those of vhose household he had formed a part; where the magnet' hat had drawn him thither, unconsciously underlying his very thought, as the blue of the skies seems to surround the tam?   ILV Ui t U n i / /Iv I1.   o t  "Perhaps," was the terrible self-made answer, "they each d all are forming a part of the destruction lying before B, to be beheld in life never more." Upon this reflection, his agony rose to a pitch almost un- durable, while remembering the cruel suspicions of quetry and lightness with which he had stained the purity Helen's character. Ah, how tender we can be to the dead! How like mist le away their faults! How unblemished is the record we 'ite upon their tombs! How, in the distance, we forget concerning them except what is beautiful and true! And ho would have it otherwise? The idea is sweet to the )urner, and as sweet, in anticipation, to him who is )urned. Let us' be thankful that a network of flowers vers our earth-weeds when we lie down to our final rest. Herbert had accused our heroine of duplicity, or perhaps worse motive, in writing a note to Frank Stoddard at reenwood Seat; now his better judgment told him that ere might be some combination of circumstances whereby e mystery could be explained. More marvellous things an this had been unravelled in the wide field of romance. )th strangers to the Draytons, their past unknown, might at the tie of cousinship or brotherhood, for some cause ncealed, have sanctioned her apparent freedom with him )on the night of his arrival? He had thought her tenderer Dr. Percival than suited his strict ideas of maidenly pro- iety; but had he not saved her life by his attention and ill.? He had even, in his mad jealousy, blamed her for ring another. Had she not a right to bestow her affec- rns on whom she pleased? Was it her fault if she could At succeed in living down the passion which she had told m it was her life-effort to conquer? Oh, for one moment ce to face with her whom he had iujured; one moment to )pear before her frankly, breathe a wish for happiness, and d her a final farewell, so that by some freemasonry from ul to soul, she could at once understand his sorrow for his irsh judgment, and so ease his conscience of its weight of If-accusation. The way between him and the chamois-hunter's home emed to be cruelly extended at each onward step, while the     350       HELEN COURTENA Y. sights meeting his view on every side were not calculated to calm his fevered anxiety. Here were trees torn up by the roots; cottages in ruins; roads impassable, and new-made streams forcing their way, with a will almost human, through every obstacle. The two lovely islands in the lake of Lowertz had entirely disappeared, merged in the common mass of the fallen mountain; and so great had been the impetus of its descent, that large masses of earth and rocks had been carried half way up tie sides of the Mount Rigi. This alone would have been heart-rending, this destruc- tion of things inanimate; but to these was added the horror of the thought that hundreds of the peasants of that and the neighboring villages were buried alive beneath the ruins. Sometimes Herbert encountered sad processions bearing the new-found dead for a peaceful robing for the grave; sometimes the dying appealed to him for assistance, looking the agony they could not speak, through their fast-closing eyes; here a mother ran frantically towards him screaming for her lost children, and children clung around him beseech- ilig him to search for their missing parents. Everywhere men were seen digging in quest of bodies, dead or alive; every- where issued cries from beneath entombed cottages, while occasionally a burst of gratulation rent the air at some suc- cessful excavation disclosing an unconscious, though not yet deceased group. Sonme, at least, then were saved, was Herbert's thought; and Helen, where was she? Hope lent fresh fleetness to his footsteps as he redoubled his speed towards his destination. On his- right lay the lake of Lowertz, half filled with the earth of the mountain; on its banks all that remained of the town-its church de- molished, but the tower, miraculously standing amid the surrounding wreck, pointed heavenward, while a few build- ings yet stood firm on their stone foundations on the bor- ders of the lake. Casting his glance quickly around, Herbert recognised the curate's house, before which the mass of earth had most wonderfully stopped in its headlong course, and adjoining this, oh! sight of anguish, was the chamois-hunter's half- buried and scarcely-to-be-recognised cottage.   HELEN  OUR RTENA .      351 Then, with a beating heart, but with seeming carelessness, e besought one at work, and not far distant from the spot there he stood, to tell him something of those who dwelt herein. "We have scarcely time to breathe," answered the man; and none to think of anything beyond what we are oc- upied with at the moment, taking the houses one by one s they come, without partiality; there are few, if any, in eed of our help-at the chamois-hunter's; he himself went Ist week in search of game; his wife, child, and the stran- er gentleman, with his flaxen-haired daughter, have gone to neighboring fair; only one is left, a dark-haired lady; it is tardly worth while to labor on that house while ten lie dying r dead beneath this ruin upon which we are working." "Only one, yet alll" groaned Herbert, turning from im, and, seizing a spade from a man who was reclining tint with exhaustion from his past exertions, commenced he work of disinterment. Calling upon that beloved name, ut with no reply to his frantic appeal, he persisted in his Imost futile and wearisome efforts. The shipwrecked mariner strains every nerve of his being o save himself from a watery grave; the traveller, over- aken by a tempest in dangerous woods, has but one bought, self rescue; Herbert was toiling for something far earer than his individual life. Sometimes he wrought lone and unaided in the task; occasionally his entreaties revailed upon a passer-by, searching for a loved and missing ne, to spare a few moments to assist in the arduous employ- lent; but this was seldom, as each seemed to be bent upon he saving of some one connected especially with himself. At length, after hours of unremitting excavation, Herbert aw a gleam of hope, when discovering that he had dug away he earth so effectually that his spade struck against a dindow under the projecting eaves of the house. A divine, subtile throb of joy pervaded his frame at this rood fortune, and fresh strength came to his arm, giving him ew power to make an aperture large enough to allow him o peer into the interior of the building, while again he called pon Helen to answer, if she were within, to his appeal. But no glad, expected response came; the room in which     3.52      JHELEN  CO URTEN4 Y a he had been able to penetrate being of a twilight darkness, some time elapsed before his eyes became accustomed to the pervading gloom, until, oh-! blessed moment, he espied an object like a human form lying close by the casement e through which he was looking, and which, as it was gradually defined in the darkness, his heart as well as his sight as- sured him, was she for whom that desperate search had been made. Still more distinct grew the shadowy outline,  while the fresh air from without partially awoke the uncon- scious one from her stupor. One sigh, long and full, came  from her oppressed bosom, as if it were suddenly relieved from a heavy weight; then, with rich and passionate intona- tion, and with a childlike smile upon her lips, she uttered his name, once, twice, thrice, in accents that seemed to have stolen their tenderness from the very cradle of love, and like syllables of primeval speech, were glad to be born into a life of sound. Next followed a second sigh, more soft than the first, accompanied by a renewal of her sleep-if such that stupor could be called-and all was still again. "Herbert, Herbert, Herbert!" those words touched his soul and thrilled him, as he had never been touched and thrilled before. With almost superhuman strength he tore awav the barrier between them, bounded into the room, caught her in his arms, returned into the open air and carried his precious burden-his, his own-saved, won for himself despite the claims of any other, to the pastor's home, now deserted by its inmates, who were still searching for those of his flock who had been overtaken by the terrible calamity. There, placing her upon a couch, he waited for her restoration, using all the simple means with which he was acquainted to bring her back to consciousness. How tempting were her perfect lips, alluring, as it were, the soft pressure of his own; how white and inviting her snowy lids, upon which he longed to shower a rain of kisses that might wake them magically into life and motion; how he pined to breathe upon her some revivifying influence that would cause her to raise those curtained eyes, giving him, like the Peri before the closed gates of Paradise, a glimpse of the glory hidden within! But fierce as was the desire, the almost uncontrollable   HELEN COUR TENAY.        353 assion, to gather her into his arms and hold her slowly ilsing heart to his, with strange self-command he resisted ie promptings of his strong nature, because of a dim hope L the future (born of the loving emphasis of his name in er time of direst periD, the hope that she might yet be is own; and to have stolen then what he thought time light bring him honestly, would have been like robbing er and himself. Had he known, however, the sequel of iat day, with the agony of blighted anticipation, he would ave held her a moment against his'breast in reckless esperation; but not foreseeing the end, as a brother might ratch over a sister, he watched her pallid cheeks and waited )r their roseate bloom. As she lay thus, his hands chafing hers with an endeavor ) restore their lost circulation, she slowly opened her eyes nd fixed them wonderingly on his face. Then the dark ishes drooped again, while a blush of crimson overspread er countenance as she drew gently away from him; nd pressing her eyes, as if to bring memory to her aid, sked confusedly what had occurred, why she felt thus weakened as with months of illness, and how it happened liat they two were there, the sole inmates of the good astor's parlor. Reassured by Herbert's calm and self-possessed manner, telen listened with deep interest to what he had to relate; ow he had lost his friend and inheritance, and while un- ertain about his future course, had received a letter from Lmerica, requiring him to be at New Orleans at a certain ime; how he had felt that he could not part from the )raytons and herself, perhaps for ever, without saying farewell;" and lastly, how he had come, and finding her )uried beneath the ruins, had rescued her from death. Silent tears flowed down Helen's cheeks during this re- ital; something ought to be said, she knew, to express her Gratitude for her deliverance; but the words died unuttered )n her lips. "Forgive me for this silence," she said at length i" but it eems so poor, so meagre, to utter commonplaces in return or a gift of life." Had he been her brother, as she wished then that he had , q     354       HELEN COURTENA Y.           X' been, she would have laid her tearful face upon his bosom,  and widing her arms about him, have made action take  the place of speech, in addressing one who had saved her  from so dreary a fate. But alas! not for Herbert could 1 these things be; not even did she dare to take his hand between her own and say, "I thank you," knowing not how  such a demonstration would be received. In the first place,  his conduct towards her had ever been capricious and  unmarked by any rule; sometimes he had been kind, almost devoted; sometimes cold and neglectful, often seem-  ing purposely to avoid her; and once (she could not bear to  think of it), he had overleaped the bounds prescribed by strict etiquette, and had been guilty of a familiarity not war- ranted by their previous intercourse. All these memories deterred her from any frank expression of her feelings in word or act, and kept her from following the dictates of her im- pulses; while lastly, the gulf between Hades and Heaven he had himself marked as their dividing-line, effectually restrained her from any emotions beyond those of the most guarded kind. "I will tell you how to be grateful for your rescue," he  answered; "let me hear, once more, in the same tone, the word you spoke in the chamois-hunter's home." "In the chamois-hunter's home! When, what word?" sle questioned. "Have you so soon forgotten?" he asked reproachfully. "How can I forget what I do not remember to have said " she replied. "I must have been dreaming when I spoke it." "Then dream again," said Herbert softly, "and let me hear it before I leave you, perhaps eternally." "I would rather thank you in reality than in the weird accents of shadowy vision," returned Helen, "if I only knew how; words in sleep are unmeaning and worthless; but if you desire it, you have only to tell me what I said, and I will faithfully repeat it." "No," he replied, turning mournfully from her and ap- proaching the door; "I care not to hear it, since it meant nothing and was worthless; it were worse than folly to give ear to so idle a thing." Then a bitter thought uprose in   HELEN COURTENA Y.        355 mind, more deep-rooted than his disappointment or his row, and curling his lip scornfully, he muttered mock- ly, A finished coquette; yes, even in her dreams." At these words, whose murmur only was heard by Helen, sense being lost in the distance between them, Mr. ayton, May, the chamois-hunter's wife, and her child, tered the apartment. Joyful, yet sorrowful, was the meeting; joyful for what ?y had escaped, sorrowful for what Helen had suffered i the scenes of misery around them; whiled the young isse pressed her child more closely to her bosom as she )ught what might have been its fate, and looked mo- untly for the arrival of her husband to rejoice with her er their safety. Herbert's presence was soon explained, while letters by a last mail led to the forming of new and unexpected Ins. One of Mr. Drayton's communications was from the pro- ietor of Greenwood Seat, acquainting him that being out to leave the Continent, he desired to return to his Lglish home; while Helen recognised in a missive belong- g to herself, the superscription of Stephen Gerald. Its con- its were brief, simply saying that her business, in its 3sent aspect, could not possibly be arranged without her esence and signature; and that it was imperative for her, she desired the successful furtherance of her plans, to be New Orleans by the first of the coming December. With our heroine, the law, as such, was supreme, though e knew it had its abuses; her 'blind obedience to this wer resembling that of the old inhabitants of Aragon, 10, upon a new succession to the throne, caused a justice administer the coronation oath sitting, while the monarch, eeling and bare-headed, took upon him his vows, thus mbolizing the superiority of the Law over Prerogative. Ius, though she did not for one moment think of disputing e summons of Stephen Gerald, with great heart-sinkings e regretted the new complication of affairs, which could ,t but lead her, personally, into unforeseen difficulties.- Informing the rest of the party that a friend, whose ishes could not be ignored, had great need of her presence     356      HZELEN  COURTENA Y.  in America, Helen added that she must leave the service and kind protection of Mr. Drayton for a while, trusting, if May still desired it, to return before many months to her present occupation. Upon the reception of this intelligence, May's remon- strances were most vociferous; she could not, would not  endure the separation, for it was one of her chief solaces to converse with Helen on her bright but transient dream of happiness, finding in her sympathy alone healing for the deep-seated wound. As it was the main object of Mr. Drayton's life to pro- mote May's comfort and pleasure, he proposed that his daughter and himself should accompany Helen on her voy- age; while Herbert, only too glad of their companionship joyfully acceded to the plan of making one of the party of homeward-bound exiles. --o------- CHAPTER XXX. OUR travellers, after they had rendered what assistance they could to the unfortunate inhabitants of Lowertz; and had witnessed the joyful return of the chamois-hunter, departed on their way. Their sympathies had been most painfully enlisted in behalf of the sufferers; for not only were there mournings for the loss of life by burial beneath the huge masses of earth and rocks that had descended from the Rossberg, but also by the flood of. water, forced from the lake over the land when the mountain fell, submergino for a while whole villages by the passing swell. Sad, indeed, was the scene they were quitting, so changed from the smiling, happy land that greeted them on their arrival, for even while journeying they encountered terrible pictures of heart-rending sorrow; friends still searching for friends, tearful processions bearing along their dead, dis- figured corpses, cries of agony, homeless women and chil- dren, and poverty-stricken wretches pleading for money or bread. Having done all that lay in their power, glad   HELEN COURTENA Y.         357 were they to escape from sights so depressing to the fairer views of England's harvest fields. One bright memory, however, lingered in their minds, returning at intervals through lives varied by many experi- ences-the last glimpse of the chamois-hunter and his wife; he, bright, handsome, happy, holding aloft the child, who with its dimpled hands tossed     kisses to Helen and May; she, the lovely hostess, in her bright and coquettish attire, looking laughingly and with  pride upon her hus- band and babe, while tears glistened in her eyes at the thought of losing the companionship of her gentle guests. Only lingering long enough at Greenwood Seat to make final arrangements for leaving its lordly halls for ever, the now broken circle took passage in a vessel bound for America. The autumnal storms were over, and clear and wintry was the day when they left the shores of the mother land. The ocean seemed to have rocked itself to sleep, giving promise of one of those calm, uneventful voyages; which at certain periods of the year sometimes bless the pilgrims of the main. There were few, if any, cabin passengers, and as Mr. Drayton and May preferred the'retirement of their state- rooms to the more life-like and bustling deck, Herbert and Helen were thrown into each other's society at all hours and seasons. To some, the sea has been rightly called an affliction; but to others, the best of delights. For the last, the often meaningless etiquette of society is dispensed with; there are no household cares to interrupt or annoy; scandal is not busy; we are face to face with natureS what we say and do, is said and done naturally; we enjoy more; we suffer less; the whispering wind bids care begone; the sunlight, glancing on the waves, commands us to be cheer- ful; we give to others our best thoughts as freely as the clouds give their showers; we find ourselves speaking un- reservedly to strangers, because we make a part of the same household, and listen with, interest to old truths expressed in new wording. We live in a fresh world of pleasure, a kind of ideal existence, which ceases not until our good bark reaches her destined strand.     3o8       HELEN COURTENAY.  And it was this life that Herbert and Helen lived in that homeward voyage.  Hourly, momently together, their hearts mutually unfolded to one another like blossoms un- der the influence of a summer sun; they read, they talked together, and together sang snatches of some half-re- membered song; they grew merry in unison over a passing incident affording food for mirth, and sad when a tale of sorrow opened the fount of tears; or in the dreamy twilight repeated the pet poesy memorized in other years. And the more blessed were these moments because so fleeting-a draught of bliss before despair; a long look at summer fields to dying eyes; a lingering gaze at loved ones before a final summons to the night of the grave. Standing thus on the brink of separation, what wonder that, after the fashion of poor human nature, they forgave themselves for being so inconsistent, and for gathering forbidden flowers which they knew must perish in the culling! And so it came to pass that one night, strong in love, but weak in resolve, feeling an imperative need of Helen's sympathy, forgetting or ignoring the fact that she was linked in some mysterious way to another, softened by the influence of the sweetest starlight that ever looked down upon happy or suffering mortality, melted by the tender beauty of her glorious eyes, unwise when he should have been wisest, reckless when he had most need for self-con- trol, he told her of his love. They were leaning together over the ship's side, impressed with the solemn charm of night. There had been a rumor that day of reaching port the next, and both felt the gloom of the coming parting hour. Herbert, unconsciously drawing nearer to Helen, gazed dreamingly upon the dark waves with their fringe of phosphorescent light, as if seeking to pierce their secret depths. "Would that to-morrow would never come," he exclaimed impulsively and passionately, "and that this life could last for ever and for ever, this sweet, placid dream-time. When I think of my vague, uncertain future, tempest-tost and objectless, I cannot control the wish that I were lying in secure rest in the coral caves of these peaceful waters."   HELEN C0 URTENA Y.        359 Helen only sighed in answer, not being equal to speaking )f the hour which would so surely separate her companion md herself, and finding only an echo to his thoughts in her )wn depression of spirit. "You sigh," continued Herbert moodily, "perchance for very happiness; the cup of joy, with you, is so full that thus it overflows; connecting link with link, and using no extraordinary penetration, I actually see beneath the sur- face into your once struggling heart, at present freed from its conflicts. There appears to be no need now in 'trying to forget;' all obstacles to the indulgence of your tenderest feelings seem to be removed, since your friend, as you have told us (of course the friend), has sent an imperative sum- mons for you which you are rejoiced to obey. Nor do I wonder at your glad emotions, for what a happy prospect lies before you! Yes, something tells me that on reaching our destination you will meet him whom you love, and be- tween whom and yourself no barriers interpose. Clasped in his arms, you will forget the time that you have been severed from him, because of its insignificance compared with the delight of your reunion. In contrast, let me tell you my heart's history and its mournful sequel. I, like you, have one abiding preference; but mark the difference, mine is like a dead vine yielding nothing; yours, you know, every- thing. Love  It is a little word, but its meaning is eter- nal. She whom I love is with me, alike in my dreams and in my waking hours; every desire of my heart is towards her; every prayer I utter includes herself. We differ in many things, yet our differences give tone to our inter- course; our mutual thoughts, like the varied colors of the rainbow, mingling together in perfect harmony. Call it passion if you will, if passion be the desire of possession, yet I need her spiritual influence no less than her bodily presence. I feel that there is something in her belonging to me, mine; and yet, alas! we are severed world-wide. I long for her at the fireside and in the wilds; in crowds or in loneliness; but most I need her when thought comes to me of the mysterious future world, eternity. Wherever I am, there her companionship will be a necessity. I want her angel-life as well as her mortality."     36O       HELEN COURTENA Y. Helen listened to these words with her whole soul, but did not for a moment imagine that they pointed to herself. It is woman's province to comfort and console, nay, her natural instinct; and with her heart filled with pity for him whose affection some heartless woman had rejected, with still a deeper emotion underlying the first, that of the latent passion, which, like a hidden fire, it had been her effort to smoulder, she turned towards Herbert to give what help she could. "Who, who," she asked, "could have spurned such a devoted love as yours? Who could turn away from affec- tion so warm, so constant?" "You " The little word was uttered with an intensity of feeling that shook his whole frame, while in pronouncing it the barrier of reserve was broken down as a flood destroys an obstruction that has no power to resist its overwhelming force. "You!" Then seizing her hand, he cradled it fondly in his own, gazing on it as on some gem of priceless worth, pressed his lips passionately upon it, and then bending down, laid the open palm upon his brow, imprisoning it with both his own. This sudden change from the wide distance they had ever. preserved to that close act of intimacy, wrought upon him as upon a captive ushered from his midnight dungeon into a delicious life of beauty, waking every sense instantane- ously to its highest capacity of enjoyment; if anything, the emotion was too intense, the light too full for hitherto dark- ened eyes. Her it utterly subdued; like one overtaken by a storm against which it is impossible to battle, she was powerless bodily; while the spirit part of her, her soul, her finer self, seemed lost, merged in his own. Thus they stood for a minute, minutes, until at length he uprose erect, put her away from him as if to leave her free from any influence of his own, and spoke: "I do believe that you love me." Not one word did she vouchsafe in answer to his terribly earnest assertion, but only shrank back as if to elude his   HELEN COURTEN AY.        361 scrutiny, at the same time placing her hand upon her heart, as though the action would hide its beating from his view. "I do believe," continued he, a note of triumph in his tone, "that you have conquered the memory against which you have been battling; and having succeeded, look in kind- ness upon myself. Not indeed from any words of yours do I judge, but by the unstruggling repose of your dear hand in mine that said so much, and by its benediction upon my brow, that has ennobled me above royalty, and in so doing has spoken louder than a thousand tongues. If I am not mistaken, if you do think me worthy of so rich a trust, come to me, Helen; of your own will, come!" His voice was tuned to a tone of unutterable tenderness; and opening wide his arms, he invited her to happiness and peace. Oh, deep-desired relief; oh, resting-place above all others fitted to her weary head and heart! Alone in the world, who but he could supply the place of all lost ties of kin- dred and other loves! Taking one step forward towards him, and forgetting all in him, a blush of keen delight stole to her face; her lips were parted with a smile; her eyes dew with unshed tears; she seemed all aflame with a new-born spirit of bliss. Loved by him! that was to have attained the best earthly destiny in God's giving. Loved by him who seemed made for her, as night is made for sleep and repose, or day for labor and activity; why resist that delicious nbte of almost seraphic music, that sweet invitation sounding again in her ears  Come!" But even while stepping onward towards the desired haven of security, a night-bird, poising itself for a moment on the rigging near, uttered a harsh, discordant cry, and then fled away over the waters. Thought is quicker than lightning, and Helen thought; her chain of ideas broken, her dream of joy dispersed, the message of the bird seemed clear; a voice from spirit- land sent to remind her of her duty, and to echo loudly Herbert's fateful words spoken at Westminster Abbey: "There is something as separate from my world as Hades from Heaven." 16     362       HELEN CO URTEVNA Y Would it be right, asked that stern monitor, hMr con- science, to deceive him, keeping him in ignorance of what she had been? No, that were to soil her own soul, and to do him the worst kind of injury, striking him, as it were, in the dark. But need she let that, the concealment of her past, stand between them? Ought she to throw away his love as one throws a jewel into the sea? No, she would tell him all; and affection would find an excuse, applauding rather than condemning her for the course which she had pursued, for- giving and tolerating her, even for having been an actress, when it should be revealed to him that filial duty alone had prompted her to what he so much hated. Yes, she would tell him all. But in quick succession came another thought. Her father had said: "Only reveal my dishonor when it becomes a necessity, or to save you from untruth." Was it then a necessity to tell her parents shame for her own selfish ends t Could she not relinquish the bliss of loving and being loved for the sake of keeping his memory pure? Nor need .Her- bert's suffering be of any extraordinary kind; for men, after years or months of absence, had forgotten women to whom they had vowed to devote their lives; and the old adage, that " many a heart is caught in its rebound," had never lost, and would never lose its force. Was Herbert in any way different from the rest of the sex? Would it not be just as easy for him to forget as others? Again, once through weakness, she had nearly betrayed her secret to Dr. Percival; she was stronger now, and edu- cated to the habit of keeping her own counsel; and as the bearing of the cross was light in comparison to the uplift- ing, there was no further excuse for not guarding her sacred trust with jealous care. Had Herbert been any other than just himself, the de- frauded heir, circumstances might warrant a full confession; but would he agree, were he cognisant of it, to the sacrifice she had made? Would not the day of the settlement, so near at hand, surely come? And, above all, would not Ste- phen Gerald and the witnesses, with the might of the law, force him into accepting his rights? If he demurred, would   HELEN CO URTENA Y.       363 not the whole be made public, the world know of the breach of honor, and she be pointed at as the daughter of the man who had cheated the son of his generous friend? No, she could not, would not confess; and silence was all that remained to her. "At least," said her heart, pitifully pleading to the stern monitor conscience, " at least let me tell him that I do not love another." "No," answered the harsh judge, " that would only be an incentive to him to persevere in his efforts to win you to himself." "I am hungry and thirsty for you, Helen," she heard Her- bert say once more; " come, and satisfy my hunger; come, and slake my thirst. Let us live together for earth and heaven." Still like a statue she stood, her eyes alone betokening a sense of life; with them she gave him one look, whose world of tenderness was lost upon him in the dim light of the stars; then, turning from him oceanwards, leaned once again over the vessel's side. Wearied at length by her delay, impatient, maddened by her seeming trifling, he caught her, almost rudely, by the arm, and held her fast. "You shall answer one question," he said imperatively, "coquette, Circe, Lurleya! Despite to-night's endearing demonstrations to me, do you still cling to the memory which you said you must forget? Still remember that scene in the study-room of Greenwood Seat? That letter? That confession? Still love that man a?" In no wise moved by his harshness, but calm as a summer sea, she raised her eyes heavenward, and, as if repeating some holy creed, said slowly: "Yes, now as then, now as for ever and for ever." Then afraid to trust herself longer, she gently extricated herself from his grasp, and left him to the companionship of his bitter, bitter thoughts. -o---     364       HEL EN CO UR TENA Y. CHAPTER XXXI. IF avoiding Helen was forgetting her, then most surely did Herbert achieve his purpose. During the remainder of the voyage, which was not of many hours' continuance, he saw but little of her, and then never alone; while she, on her part, seemed equally desirous of shunning him. Even after thev reached New Orleans, Herbert, in answer to Mr. Drayton's invitation to go to the same hotel as him- self, and to share his private parlor, replied that he preferred the business localities of the city; and though obliged to Mr. Drayton for his thoughtfulness, had decided upon another place of abode. Time passed, bringing the first of December alarmingly near for our heroine, though she longed for the tranquillity which would probably follow a final settlement of her monetary affairs. Though a comparative stranger in New Orleans, only having passed through it on the occasion of her embarking for Liverpool, or paid brief visits to it in her father's lifetime, she had found her way to Mr. Gerald's office, and had threaded her path through the highways and by- ways leading to it alone, though luckily it was not far removed from the hotel chosen by Mr. Drayton for their residence. In the interview with her eccentric but faithful friend, he informed her that though he had endeavored to arrange her business without her personally appearing in the matter, he had found it impossible so to do, her presence being re- quired at the time of the transfer of property, in order that her signatures could have witnesses, and moreover to sub- stantiate the claims of Edward Lee, alias Herbert Drayton, to the inheritance. He added, however, that if she pre- ferred, the parties concerned could meet at the hotel, and there conclude the transaction; but as this necessarily would bring the whole or a part of it to the knowledge of Iayv and iMr. Drayton, Helen expressed a desire to have the matter adjusted at the lawyer's office, where Mr. Gerald's kindness and consideration made-her feel already somewhat at home.   ELELif- COURTEYAT.   .    365 This being decided- upon, her legal adviser, true to his vocation, with the advantage of his client in view, but of course not knowing all the consequences involved in the proposition, suggested that Helen, by raising a point of arbitration as regarded the heir's change of name, might, after some legislation, be absolved from the bond of pay- ment. But to this Helen entirely objected, saying, peremp- torily, that the money was hers alone, willed to her by her grandfather, and that no other disposition should be made of it except the one in view; which was, moreover, the legitimate one. After this decisive conversation, and just before taking leave of the lawyer, Helen carelessly added that he need not go through the form of an introduction between Mr. Drayton and herself, as they had some previous acquaint- ance; then, reiterating that she would return on the ap- pointed day, she left him to rejoin her friends at the hotel. It was late ia the afternoon, and when about stepping into the private entralnce, she thought she heard her name called by a voice which sounded familiar. Concluding that it was a mistake, she was hurrying up the stairway, when the same voice ia tones of entreaty uttered her name again. Turning as she stood on the step, she was somewhat alarmed at finding herself confronted by a man who appeared to be an object of charity, in the garb of a common sailor. His clothes were worn and mean; his beard unshorn; his face thin and pale, stamped with sickness and want; his hair lying in tangled masses over his brow; while as he stood he trembled with apparent weakness.- Helen was about to place a piece of money in his hand in order to be rid of him, being terrified at the stranger's informal mode of address, when a bright blush overspread his pallid countenance, accompanied with words that ar- rested her attention and filled her with astonishment.- "Oh! not that, Helen; I want your sympathy, your friendly counsel. I am your cousin, Frank Stoddard, or rather the wreck of what he once was. If you mistrust me, here is the ring you gave me long ago, and- with which I have not parted, even to satisfy the pains of hunger."     366       HELEN C0 UR TENA . "My poor Frank " and a sudden flow of tears was Helen's answer; while no longer doubtful that the object before her was the companion of her childhood, and her once gay and handsome cousin, changed by misfortunes to this shadow of his other self, she clasped his extended hand and drawing him into the reception-room at the foot of the stairs, which luckily was unoccupied, bade him be seated and relate to her what chances had befallen him whom they had so long mourned as dead, and how it came to pass that she had the good fortune to meet him then and there. "The last is almost as much a mystery to me as to your- self," he replied; " though I will tell you all, dear Helen, being assured that now, as ever, you will be my good angel, and that you will help me in my extremity." The light that flitted over the poor sailor's wan face as he said this, brought to Helen a realization of his identity; for Frank Stoddard's smile was one never to be forgotten so bright, genial, and beautiful was it, so redolent of the very spirit of joy. "You remember," he continued, "that I took passage for America in order to make some business arrangements before my marriage to one who has been my ever-present thought, though she may now have forgotten that I ever existed."  "No," replied Helen, eagerly, glad to give a ray of com- fort to one apparently so forlorn; "May still loves you and will always love you, living or dead." "Thank God!" he answered, looking up devoutly; then continued, "  the vessel, unfortunately, encountered a series of storms; one she might have weathered; but not being able to withstand so many rude shocks, midway in our voyage became an entire wreck.  Her passengers and crew taking to the life-boats, many were drowned, many died of starvation, and I at length found myself alone, without food, drifting on the wide Atlantic.' After the lapse, it seemed to me in my misery, of days and weeks of tossing over the huge billows, I was barely conscious of being rescued and lifted to the deck of a vessel outward. bound.   HELEN COURTERNA         367 "Strange faces and strange tongues were around me, but I met with a certain sort of kindness in being fed, warmed, and let alone. The ship was destined to one of the East India islands, and after a prosperous voyage reached her port. Without money, and without friends, I commenced theweary work of supporting myself by the humblest occu- pations, nor was it always that I could procure the kind of labor for which I was fitted in that country where wages are almost nominal. "When nearly worn out with homesickness and fatigue, a bark bound for New Orleans touched at the island. After entreaties and prayers, the captain agreed to take me as a common sailor before the mast, and in this way I was re- quired to pay for the privilege of a passage home. Unfor- tunately, I became ill almost at the commencement of the voyage, and instead of my promised usefulness, was of no benefit whatever, the captain ordered me from his sight, caring not whether I lived or died; in fact, I think he would have preferred the latter, in order to be rid of my unprofitable presence. "Wasted by fevers and chills, and utterly down-hearted, I found myself an hour ago at a wharf in this city, and was about to call on my uncle's old friend, Mr. Gerald, to ask him for assistance, until, with returning health and strength, I could repay him, when I saw some one in whose graceful form and gait I at once recognised yourself; and though I could not imagine why you had changed your home from England, where I had last seen you, to America, I followed you and spoke ere you disappeared from my sight within this hotel, whose portals are not for such an object as myself to enter unquestioned. Helen, my story is told." "And a sad one it is," she replied; but added, smiling through her tears, " let us not forget, Frank, the old adage, that 'It is darkest before dawn.' You must at once go and make yourself presentable, smoothe those tangled locks, and, above all, clothe your face, in the bright smile that won the love of May. You know that we have often shared our pocket-money, as we called it, in our childhood; here, dear cousin, take my purse and use its contents." Then seeing     368       HELEN  O UR TENAY. a second blush suffuse his countenance at her offer, she con- tinued with winning, irresistible grace: "You understand, Frank, I only lend you the filthy lucre (monarchs are willing to stoop to borrow), and will require payment in acts of kindness to myself, when, stricken in years, I come to be cared for by you and May in your happy home. Go, and return in the course of the evening, when vou can tell your adventures in approved romance style to your Saxon-haired lady-love, who, with her father, is in this very house. How becoming is that flush of joy, Frank. Even if May has swerved from her allegiance, such another," added Helen, archly, "would win her back." Thus urged, partly by Helen's pleasantry and wholly by her serious earnestness, Frank was departing on his mission of beautifying and self-restoration, when Helen recalled him. "I have been thinking," she said, " that your abrupt ap- pearance, since May has mourned you as one dead, might be injurious to her, as she is far from strong, and we are in the habit of avoiding everything that might serve to excite her unnaturally. Not only did your supposed death thus serve to weaken her nerves, but her sister Cornelia's sad fate, which in time you shall hear. You understand, then, the necessity of breaking the happy news of your return gently, very gently to ler; my plan being for you to ap- pear before her just as you are (she would never recognise you), and personate one who was with her betrothed in his last moments. This will lead her by degrees to what will remain for me to reveal, the actual presence of him for whom she sorrows so faithfully." Frank demurred and expostulated, and not without rea- son, teeling that perhaps if May pierced through the dis- guise of his present plight, the love and the sentiment belonging to love, so long lavished upon him, would take wings and fly away. But Helen, whose imperious will had always gained the victory in their childhood, had lost none of her power over him now. Taking no denial, the two ascended the stairs together. The door of the parlor being ajar, the heavy carpet on which they trod did not betray their coming.   HELEN COURTENA Y        369 "She is there," said Helen to Frank, as they stood for an instant on the threshold of the apartment, "occupied as she often is, for hours." He looked as Helen pointed, and draped by the heavy window curtains stood May, her profile half turned towards them, her head with its luxuriant veil of flaxen ringlets bent downwards, while she was intently regarding something held in her hand. She was thinner and paler than when her affianced had parted with her; but his heart leaped with as strong a throb of delight at sight of her then, as when she bloomed with rosy health and joy. "You see her faithfulness, Frank," said Helen in a whis- per to him. "This is her constant employment; it is your picture upon which she thus gazes." The forlorn-looking sailor, nerved with new strength and life, was about to spring forward, reckless of consequences, and clasp her in his arms, when Helen gently held him back. "Step aside," she whispered again, "for a moment; I would have a little conversation with her before you ven- ture into her presence in the character of her shipwrecked lover's companion." As Frank obeyed her, she approached May, who blushed at being detected in her fond scrutiny of the picture-face. "You remember," said Helen, glancing down at the me- dallion, "how often you have told me if you could only see some one who had seen him, hear his last words, and know that he remembered you, you would be compa- ratively content. Now I need not tell you how and where in my walks I have met with just. such a one, and I have brought him to you, May; he stands without the door." Helen beckoned to Frank, who now approached, trem- bling as much as May herself; but thanks to the gathering twilight, his emotion was unperceived. "This person," said Helen, turning aside to hide the smile which she could not prevent, "was a sailor in the vessel in which Mr. Stoddard took passage; he tells me that their spfferings and privations were beyond expression terrible." "Can -we not, cannot my. father assist you!" said May, 16*     ---- . ^ vlt jx vat sYr 1. * gazing pityingly upon the miserable object. 'We should be most happy to do anything in our power to aid you." Frank murmured his thanks, and looked his appreciation of May's kindness so tenderly, that Heleln was obliged to interrupt his silent eloquence, for fear that his'betrothed would recognise the love-glance of old. "No doubt,"she said, ', your assistance would be quite acceptable, May; you can state the case to your father. I believe," she continued, turning to the stranger, , that Mr. Stoddard gave you a message for Miss Drayton,incase you were fortunate enough to be rescued from    the wreck. "Yes," faltered the sailor, trying to deiiver the mission with wicih he was supposed to be charged, but failing ill his endeavor. "I thinkl you mnentioned," continued Helen, pertinacious- ly, "he requested you to say that his last thoughts were given to Miss Drayton." At this juncture in the interview, May, covering her face with her hands, burst into a passion of tears; while Helen glancing at Frank, saw a dangerous light in his eyes, and a forward movement which said plainly: "Stand aside; no- thing on earth can prevent me; she is mine; to me it belongs to comfort her; " when our heroine, with a sudden command- ing movement full of lofty grace, worthy of the time when she trod upon the London stager a star, stood between them, and with upraised finger and menacing look forced Frank back into silence and inaction, murmured a few words of corsolation to May, and then informed the sailor aloud, that as the interview appeared rather painful to Miss Dray- ton than otherwise, they would see him again at some not far distant period. Thus admonished, Frank obediently departed, looking forward impatiently to the hour of his return- in a guise more suited than his present one to the surroundings of his ladylove. Helen's next step was to admit Mr. Drayton into her confidence; that is, as far as Frank's return and her plan for breaking the news gently to May were concerned, and she was fully repaid by his unbounded-joy at the intelli-   HELEN CO UR TENA .   371   gence, and the almost boyish delight which he seemed tc feel at the thought of his child's happiness. Supported by Mr. Drayton's sanction, Helen then re- turned to May, and obstinately conversed about the res- cued sailor; next upon wonderful escapes from accident at sea, and the possibility of others being saved, if he was. Then she confessed that this self-same mariner had thought it probable that Frank, too, might have escaped a watery grave; and while May's cheeks glowed, and she trembled with excitement, Helen whispered to her to try to be calm while she told her the happy and wondrous news, that her lover had returned, adding that she must be prepared to see him sadly reduced by sickness and sorrow; in short, that the poor and wretched-iooking man whom she had beheld but awhile ago, in the gloom of evening, was his veritable self. Not more remarkable was the change wrought outwardly upon the lowly Cinderella by the fairy's wand, than was that which now took place externally and internally in May. At first she could not and would not believe the tidings, up- braiding Helen for so cruelly deceiving her, and then humbly asking forgiveness for having for one instant doubted her truth. Thus, by'furns smiling and tearful, May knew not whether to hope or despair, until at length, full of confidence in Helen's integrity, she rushed to her father and joyfully informed him of the unexpected and blessed intelligence, amid caresses, many and tender; while he, catching some- what the infection of her happiness, banished, for her sake, the gloom which had almost become his second nature since Cornelia's fearful death. Then, too, the very thought of Jelen's communication awoke May from the slumbers of despair to a bright, new life. The little attentions of the toilet that add so much prettiness to a pretty face, and for so long a time neglected and uncared for, were now renewed. Her flaxen curls were. smoothed with a precision that made their glossy rings once more Helen's admiration and delight, while a flush of excitement gave to her face that picture look of wax-doll innocence, that blending of red and white, which were her chief charm and attraction.     3 7 2     tELEN CO URTENA . When Helen had first seen her at Greenwood Seat, her pupils artificial acquirements seemed incongruous, linked with the character of her countenance, but touched, as she now was, by the emotion of love softened and subdued, she was very pleasant to behold, and her father's eyes fol- lowed her every movement with parental pride. Restless as a butterfly, May sometimes struck a few chords on the piano; sometimes sang snatches of merry song; now coiled her soft ringlets round her white fingers at the mir- ror; now gazed anxiously from the windows, and then, as if ashamed of her impatience, sat down demurely in the vain effort to be interested in a book. At last the time arrived when Helen thought that Frank would momently return, and embracing May, left the room, that their meeti:n, might be sacred to themselves. As she made her exit, thel expected guest stood before her. She could not lefrail from looking at him  admiringly, for something of his old self had returned, and though still weak and emaciated, this rather increased than diminished her interest in his appearance. Smilingc upon him in token of approbation, and pressing his hand warmly, she opened the door for his entrance. Helen heard the glad cry of the joyous voices: "May! Frank!"Then softly departing on her way, she left them to their heaven of happiness. Poor Helen! CHAPTER XXXII. AOrR    assuring Mr. Drayton of Frank's actual presence in the house, and being congratulated upon her tact and delicacy in the management of the meeting, Helen pro- ceeded listlessly to her own apartment, where her reflec- tions were anything but comforting. Her work, strictly as May's governess, had ceased, she being now looked upon as a friend and companion by her, and almost as a daughter by Mr. Irayton, even while he insisted upon her receiving   ELEN COURTENA Y.         373 the same salary as when her duties had been more arduous. Her employments were simply to read, at her own option, with May; to continue her lessons in music in hours of her own choosing, and to cheer the lonely girl in her be- reavement; but now, of course, since Frank had returned, she would need her no more, and Helen felt as if turned adrift again upon the wide world in search of some new occupation, and banished from what had been to her so pleasant a home. Conscious of the fact that to her influence May owed  X much, and witnessing daily her improvement in character, conduct to her father, and disposition to cure her faults, it was impossible not to feel a growing affection towards one so pliant; and to contemplate with much sorrow the severance of ties so strong. So, likewise, did the idea of bidding farewell to Mr. Drayton pain her, for it had been his aim and endeavor since her cruel exile from Greenwood Seat, to compensate her for his injustice and harshness on that occasion (though believing himself then in the path of duty), by numberless acts of attention and kindness. The first of December, Helen's day of trial, was now gear at hand; the morrow was to see her death-bed promise fully enacted, its culmination to the highest point; and she needed all the force and resolution of her strong nature to pass through the dreaded and peculiar ordeal. She knew, moreover, that Herbert would be astonished and bewildered at meeting her as Helen Courtenay at Mr. Gerald's; but what his conclusions would be, was a secondary matter, since duty was her primary thought. He could but know the fact that she was Allan Courtenay's daughter, the child of his father's friend (as the Will would inform him)--nothing more, and she resolved to do her work mechanically; then, free from the load of responsibility which had been weigh- ing upon her for years, and somewhat with the -sensations of a bird escaped from captivity, to fly away from all the associations now around her, and seek, as best she could, a new sphere and home, once more assuming her own name, as those which she had adopted had accomplished their mission in being instrumental in carrying out her father's desire and obligation.     374       HELEN CO URTENA Y. As for the deep interest entertained for one so strangely linked with her by an inexplicable chance, she knew that it would be abiding wheresoever her lot was cast; relin- quishing the idea of forgetting him as impossible, she never could, never desired to cease caring for him; but it was as the love 3f a forest rivulet for the distant moon, as fruitless and unavailing. Sometimes the thought suggested itself to her to acquaint him, since he had confessed to loving her so well, with the fact of her having been an actress, without explaining the reason why; but this would have been use- less, and would have served to bring them no nearer, since his sweeping anathema, in terms as strong as could be em- ployed, unconditionally severed them for ever. The one passion of her existence, Helen knew that no other could take its place, and she nursed it the while, as a poor prisoner cares for a dungeon plant that he knows will never be warmed with the full light of the noonday sun. In the varied scenes in which it had been her lot to be thrown; in the different characters which she had met, he, and he only, seemed to answer to the ideal of her loftiest thought; he, and he only, had the power to sway her pow- erful will; by him alone she cared to be guided and con- trolled. Thus despairing of the fruition of this hidden emotion, her affection for the unattainable became to her a memory rather than a hope, and as surely removed from her Pife as the remains of a loved one in a distant churchyard, never, never more on earth to glad her sight again. It was, then, with a chastened and subdued spirit, more than with the wild excitement demanded by the occasion, that our heroine repaired to the place of appointment a little earlier than the stated time, awaiting the coming of those who were to take part in the expected transaction. Mr. Gerald, busied with innumerable documents, red tape, and sealing-wax, only occasionally addressed her, while she sat calm and composed at his table, and as she rather shunned than courted his sympathy, was not averse to being thus ignored. Soon after her arrival, a servant brought in a card, and the lawyer reading the name Herbert Drayton aloud, dc-   HELEN COURTENAY.        835 sired that the gentleman should be admitted. Had he been less interested in the bald business details of the affair and the dignity of the law, less absorbed by events than individuals, and a greater student of human nature, he would have seen a slight trembling in the hands of his female client, and a start of astonishment in the person who entered, as he recognised the lady whom he found closeted with the barrister. Having avoided Helen most studiously since her arrival in New Orleans, to meet her then and there was food enough for wonder, without questioning himself as to what had brought her within those pre- cincts. Helen, on the contrary, after the lawyer had greeted him, bowed in a manner so self-possessed, so widely different from her mood in their last stormy interview, that for a mo- ment, doubting the evidence of his own senses, he imagined the being before him, not her to whom he had so lately made a passionate avowal of affection, but a twin sister, of whose existence he had never known until that time." Mr. Gerald, then asking him to be seated, remarked fur- ther that he should be prepared, in a short time, to proceed with the business for which Mr. Drayton had been sum- moned, resuming meanwhile his red tape and sealing occu- pations, with an occasional word to his companions. "Your cousin, Mr. Frank Stoddard," said he, among other observations, turning to Helen, "favored me with a call this morning; allow me to congratulate you upon his wonderful escape from shipwreck, and for a safe return." Your cousin, Mr. Frank Stoddard " echoed Herbert in thought. The mystery deepened; he had condemned her unheard then, *for writing to a near relation. Ah! wofully he had wronged her there. So thinking, he glanced at Helen to see if she were look- ing at him with the contempt he deserved, but instead, met the same fixed, imperturbable aspect, he had noticed when first entering, as if oblivious to himself and all her surround- ings, she was wrought up to some one course of action to which everything else was secondary, and of minor impor- tance. Mr. Gerald having finished his work, drew a chair near     376       HELEY COURITENA Y to Herbert's, facing him, while Helen Itill sat at the table, her hand shading her down-drooped eyes. "I have summoned you here," said he to Herbert, in a matter-of-fact tone, "to acquaint you with the intelligence that on this day you become possessor of a fortune (details hereafter), left by your father on certain conditions. The. trustee to whom he confided it was to appropriate the inte- rest until you attained your twenty-eighth year, provided at that time you were capable of enjoying and using, rightly, so great an inheritance, by being in mind and body fit to support yourself by your own exertions. In case of the death of the appointed trustee, the obligation extended to his heirs. As there can be no question of your soundness, physically and mentally, you have simply to prove your identity with the aforesaid Edward Lee, of which identity, I. for one, have satisfied myself completely; but there are others concerned, the witnesses, whom I expect momently. They have only to be assured of the same, and to swear to their signatures, when, Miss Courtenay," continued he, looking towards Helen, " the present holder of the property, in place of her deceased father, Mr. Allan Courtenay, will, with a few other necessary forms of law, transfer the amount at once to its rightful owner. By looking over these papers, you will find that a strict account has been kept of all monetary transactions; you will observe, also,'a list of all expenses, lawyer's charges, and so forth; for Miss Courtenay, to her honor be it said, is a most rigid and conscientious accountant, performing her part with exemplary method and exactness." Meanwhile, Herbert sat like one in a dream, taking the papers mechanically when Mr. Gerald paused, and looking, or pretending to look, over their contents. There was nothing to say, no one to thank for this property; in fact, the obligation for the use of it was all on the other side, for it was his own as certainly as his flesh or blood. To express any surprise would have been commonplace; any rejoicing, childish; to have shown to Mr. Gerald just what he felt, absurd; and to reveal to Helen, who, without the trace of an emotion, sat like an automaton, awaiting her part in what was being enacted, like endeavoring to warm one's hands in ice.   HELEN COTRT NAY.        3 7 In fact, as our hero leant over the parchment, other thoughts besides this sudden acquisition of wealth came into his mind. "Courtenay! Courtenay 1 " The name seemed entirely familiar, and forcing his think- ing powers into a given course, leaving in imagination the lawyer's office, he traversed the wide Atlantic, journeyed in England, crossed the channel into France, and sat once more within the caf6, finding the memory which he sought in the unguarded converse of strangers there. "Courtenay8 Courtenay?" "Yes, that was surely the name, the name of the dis- honorable father who had betrayed the trust of his friend. But, besides this, there was a daughter of whom they had spoken; 'a noble woman,' who had given up her fortune and her all, supporting herself as an actress to make the deficiency good." The truth flashed upon him like a gteam of lightning. The "noble woman" was before him; she who had relin- quished friends, home, retirement, to save her father's honor, and to benefit the unknown heir of the squandered property. Herbert's first impulse was to return it to her that instant as her own, something to which he had not the slightest particle of right. Even in a selfish point, he did not really need the money; for to support himself was easy enough, crowned heads having offered him employment and patron- age, and professorships having been tendered to his accept- ance. He had no anxiety about his own future. But, on second thoughts, to render back the gift, since he must furnish some reason for generosity so unparalleled to an utter stranger,(as viewed from the stand-point of Mr. Gerald and the witnesses), would involvea confession of the knowledge he had so singularly gained, and make the cause of Helen's self-abnegation transparent, when it seemed to be an object to her to hide it. This tender reverence for her motives had the effect of determining him to defer any plan of action until he could decide upon some way of delicately restoring that to which she had a right, without betraying her fearful secret. And this, he thought, perhaps was the barrier between     378       HELEN CO  TENA Y. the man whom she loved and herself; now, her work accomplished, she was free; free to give herself to one whose chain she had worn so long and faithfully; the thought was galling beyond expression. This noble woman was lost to him for ever, their connexion ending with that day. Far, far sweeter was it to think of her as she had been, toiling for him in secret, wearing out her life in distasteful occupation, so that he might be benefited. Far better would it be to see her worn, or even dead, her hands crossed meekly upon her breast in the quiet sleep of the grave, than clasped in the encircling arms of another. Then, when had she left the stage, and why? And that other? Where was he? Who was he? What magic art did lie possess to enchain her, the best and fairest woman of God's creating? Could the devotion of this unknown equal his? Would she be cherished as she deserved? Would the reality of his affection be so blended with romance that the lover would never be quite merged in the commonplace husband? Would he care for her mind as much as for the delicious fascinations of her person? Would he be her nurse in sickness; her companion in health? Would theirs be the true marriage  Al uncontrollable impulse seized him to behold this favored lover, a desire to follow Helen to the end of the world, if need be, to see for himself, him, to whom she stooped to give away her priceless heart. Next came to him another subject for speculation, namely: when, how, and where she had discovered in him the Ed- ward Lee for whom she had been toiling. Strange to say, this unspoken question was answered by Mr. Gerald, who at that moment addressed Helen. "Mr. Drayton," he said, "will, no doubt, require some data regarding the yearly income paid to his agent in Mo- bile. Be kind enough to let me have the letters received from me while you were abroad; I mentioned, you know, that they might be wanted to-day." "I am glad to see," he continued, as he looked over them, "that you have the very soul of method in your nature, systematically dating your correspondence at the time of its reception. This, you will observe," he added, taking   HELEN COURTENA F.        379 one from the package and handing it to Herbert, "will discover to you our first knowledge of your change of name." The selected epistle, unlike the rest, was crushed and crumpled as though it had been violently dealt with. Her- bert took it, looking at it with interest, because he was cu- rious to know the hour that linked in Helen's mind the name of his boyhood and that of his maturer years, but it was soon apparent that his interest was exchanged for an absorbed attention as his eye rested on her pencilled date. Meantime, when certain recollections, lost, sight of before, came to our heroine, a flush of deep crimson stole over her face, leaving it deadly white again, while it evidently re- quired a great effort to resume the tranquillity that had marked her bearing throughout the interview. What en- abled her to recover her self-mastery was the reflection that Herbert's memory, perhaps, was not as faithful as her own. But she was mistaken; for while he read and re-read the simple words, his cheeks glowed like flame, his eyes bright- ened as if new-lit from the fount of light, his breast heaved as though the joy within must have vent, and still he read and read as though earth could give him no sweeter occu- pation than just that, or as if he had discovered the long soug-lt-for secret of the alchemists of old, for in the letter he recognised that which Helen had received at Greenwood Seat, and about which she had made a confession, the only name therein, the possessor of which she acknowledged loving so entirely and devotedly, his own. As if by inspiration, the whole truth gradually unfolded to him as a flower opens to the sun, first the bud, and then the full, luxuriant bloom. Shame on his past suspicions! he felt that Helen was an embodiment of truth; her note to her cousin, but cousinly; her apparent devotion to Dr. Percival only gratitude; her unconscious calling of his name at Rossberg an index of where her affections pointed; her conduct, on the passage home, an irresistible outpour- ing of passion; her irresolute manner when he offered her his love; a struggle connected with some deep mystery un- known to him, and not, oh, not what he had cruelly named it, coquetry.     380       HELEY COURTENA . For days past he had been dead to all glad emotions; now he lived in the full sense of the word, every nerve telling of the pleasure, not the pain of existence. Although Mr. Gerald, so celebrated as a lawyer, had only arrived at deductions from arguments and proofs, without much reference to appearances, he was quite bewildered by the sudden change in Herbert's manner and the light shin- ing on his face while he perused the almost unimportant memorandum; it therefore occurred to the good man, that by some unaccountable confusion in the inheritor's mind, he had not, until that moment, recognised the fact of his enrichment, and was about to make the whole thing clearer to one seemingly so obtuse, by renewed explanations, when a servant announced that two gentlemen were below who wished to see him on business of a private nature. Asking to be excused for a few moments, and recommending to Herbert another reading of his father's behest, he closed the door unceremoniously, and left his clients alone. If some doubts disturbed Herbert's mind as to the same- ness of the letter in question with that of the study-room at Greenwood Seat, he determined to solve the doubt at once. His researches into the hidden secrets of nature as a man of science, had made him uncommonly patient and perse- vering; this persistency, together with a naturally powerful will, when bent upon achieving a certain object, had made obstacles mere shadows and mountains shifting sands. With this mood, this sense of power strong upon him, he approached Helen, and placing his chair near hers, un- folded the missive beneath her eyes upon the table, request, ing her, in a tone that had no note of pleading therein, to look upon it and to answer, truly, certain questions to which a reply was necessary. This action on his part was only replied to by Helen with an indignant exclamation and a motion of her graceful head, indicating intense disdain, while a haughty glance from her eyes asked unmistakably: "By what right do you subject me to this ordeal?" Paying no attention to the demonstration, but holding her as it were by the very force of his earnest look, he spoke once more:   HELEN aO URTEVNA Y       381 "Again I must trouble you," he said calmly, "with re- miniscences of Greenwood Seat, the study-room, the mail day. This letter," continued he, pointing with his finger to the sheet, "is pencilled with the very date of those expe- riences. Did you receive any other upon that day?" "And what authority have you," returned Helen with spirit, and rising, " to question me thus?" In the movement, her shawl fell back from her shoulders, and resting upon her chair, half draped her perfect form in graceful folds, while in an impetuous, impatient manner, she thrust away from her face the crimson-lined hood which she wore, revealing her glossy hair, and framing her countenance with a circlet resembling imprisoned flame. "Is the little freedom left to my sex all gone," she con- tinued, "that man thus commands?  Can there be no privacy of thought? Cannot one's heart be locked to one's- self; one's most sacred emotions be safe from intrusion?" Panting she stood, guarding her secret as some wild ani- mal of the forest guards its endangered young. Half Hecate, half Hebe; far too grand to be ridiculous; too much in earnest to be ignored, Herbert could not choose but admire, so splendid was she in her rage; but he dared not look long; he forgot not the object, the goal he had in view, nor stooped to gather the golden apples, but with sinews nerved for victory, pursued his onward way. Reckless of what she said, since her only motive was to veil what he most desired to know, she had allowed herself to display anger-woman's worst foe-caring little if he were disenchanted; for better this, than to draw aside the curtain revealing her naked soul. And so, as a troubled sea, her heart throbbing with its surcharged fulness, she awaited his defence. Herbert had seen her in every mood, but never thus be- fore; her face flushed with no amiable expression; her lips curled with scorn; her eyes flashing with unusual fire, while he almost quailed beneath their venomed arrows of light; almost, but not quite, he was the master still, and rising too, stolid and unmoved, he stood before her. "Mv right," said he gently, and in strange contrast to her impassioned utterance, "is the right that wepoor mor-     382       HELENf COURTENA Y tals have to seek for happiness and salvation; and though a man stood, in desperate case, on the brink of a precipice, or with only a frail plank between himself and eternity, he still has a right to make an effort for self-rescue. Thus, figuratively, I stand; deny me not a privilege in common with the lowliest soul. A faint hope-the faintest, faintest hope tells me that the name which caused the scene of that ever-to-be-remembered day at Greenwood Seat might have been mine, because it is the only one mentioned in the only letter you received; remember, I only say might have been; I have not the presumption to say it was. Some mystery hangs in ominous gloom over the whole occurrence. Men commonly are content, in such cases, with silence as an answer, if their love meets with no return. Me, it will not content. If you do not love me, say so in the plainest terms. This mystery shall be solved." Still calm, resolute, immovable he stood, like a statue endowed with speech, or a rock dashed against by fruitless waves. "It seems to me," said Helen, with quivering lip, "that you use strange language, and treat me as though I were a child or an inferior." Then, with a sudden change as if the tearful spring had merged into frigid winter, with not so much passion as with strong determination, she added, a ringing emphasis on every word: "Grant that there is a mystery, I, in my turn, deny your right to question me. It shall not be solved." Her crimson flush of indignation changed to the pallor of resolve, as with haughty step she moved towards the door to eisape his seemingly heartless persecution; but Herbert interupted her by holding her hands tightly in his own. Then she had the hardihood to smile; it was not a smile born of the marriage of joy and love, but lay upon her rosy lips like a canker on a summer blossom, and breathed of defiance and all unwomanly traits. Well was it for her own sake the hideous thing was but a mask! Well was it that Herbert was resolved to unravel its meaning, and discover its hidden spring! "Helen, Helen," he said tenderly, in a tone that made her flutter within his grasp like a frightened bird caught in the   HELEN COURTENA Y.        383 toiler's net, "in mercy stay and answer me. Say to me no, it was not myself whom you confessed to love; or yes, that it was I. If the last be the case, and you are silent, there will be such a waste of happiness, such a forfeit of human joy, that I would not be in your place to feel, as feel you will some day, the responsibility of what you have denied to a fellow-mortal." His voice, flute-like and softened, sounded like some charmed tone sent to still a tempest's fury. With subtle spell it exorcised the demon from Helen's heart, and left only the angel there; while her hands, relaxed in their stiff- ened resistance, and as placid as the old mythic pictures of the "meek-eyed morn," she stood an almost willing cap- tive, and averting her eyes answered him. It was only the ancient fable re-enacted; the Aarm, melting sun achieving more than the cutting northerolast. Woman may resist man's coldness and strength even unto death, but seldom his tender entreaties. "I Will you release me, and after this weary law business is over, promise to leave me for ever without another ques- tion if I answer the truth, yes or no? Will you never cross my path more? Will you promise?" "I promise," answered Herbert gravely, "if you still desire it, to accede to your conditions. And now-do you love me?" Next he loosened his grasp from her wrists and held them lightly, so lightly that she could easily have extri- cated them had she not known that something stronger than brute force kept her there, a mind superior, a will more powerful than her own. Then fixing his eyes upon her greedily, as one convicted fixes his eyes upon a coming messenger who brings either a condemnation to death or a reprieve, he waited patiently, patiently for her next spoken word. Presently, as twin stars uprising in beauty above the horizon, she lifted her down-drooped eyes to his, and he saw in them such a flood of tenderness, such a promise of untold bliss, that had there been no syllable to follow, their meaning would have been plain,--but still he waited trem- bling.     3 84       HELEN COURTENA Y. At last, with her eyes yet fixed on his, and a mingled cry of passion and regret, far more touching because of the conflict and the final victory of the first, the answer came: "Since it must be told, I love you; yes, I love you I " Never before had that triplet of words expressed so much, nor has it since. As a torrent of waters in the polar world breaks a way for itself through solid ice, and rifts in twain every barrier while it bursts forth in overwhelming flow, so rushed Helen's words from her long-sealed lips: and as the lightning flashes through a heavy cloud illumi- nating the darkest midnight like the day, so her look, that could not, would not be hidden, lighted up the cloud be- tween them and made it luminous as a sun. It was enough. For an instant, Herbert gathered her with a wild throb of joy to his heart; for an instant, like one who had gained the end of a painful pilgrimage, or as if she had received the baptism of an eternal peace, Helen was mute and mo- tionless; then with a strong and desperate struggle, she freed herself from his entwining arms, and stood cowering like a culprit before him, as if expecting a horrible sentence of doom from a pitiless judge. "Bu  mt I ust not love you," she said, hastily ; "nor must you love me; we must part this moment, for ever and for ever: there is a space between us as wide as 'Hades from Heaven;' those were your very words. Listen; I have been what you so utterly detest, an actress. But oh, Her- bert, not habitually; not through a long course of years; only twice, only two nights on the London stage. I left it, not because I thought acting dishonorable (I can fancy a Christian woman walking purely through a lifetime on the boards), but because it was entirely unsuited to my temper- ament. I need not have told you this; had you found it out, I might have asked forgiveness, resting on your large affection as a child upon its mother's breast; but I could not deceive you, even though the truth lost you to me for ever. Bid me farewell, and then I will depart, hiding my- self where you will never find me again." With eves filled with unshed tears, and lips quivering with emotion, she looked up expecting to find his brow   HEL E V C 0URTENA Y.      385 darkened by a frown, his eyes flashing with shafts of de- struction; but a heaven of tenderness beamed from his face, his lips were smiling a benediction, and his eyes were all love. She listened, expecting to hear maledictions deep and loud showered upon one who had deceived and misled him, but instead heard a voice which, even if it had cursed her, would have sounded like the memory of sweet music through all her coming years, repeating with a trembling cadence: "My own! my own!" So saying, his arms were once more extended, but she waved him back with a dignified gesture of her hand, while the pride, which had for a moment deserted her and which was the charm of her individual self, mixed as it was with womanly fascinations, returned once more; nor did Her- bert dare misunderstand that movement of command, say- ing plainly as it did: "Approach me not!" Then sadly she resumed speaking, as though hope had for ever departed from her life, and Herbert loved her mdre as she then appeared, than in all her previous moods. He had seen her dignified, indifferent, ice-cold; he had beheld her brief transitions from scorn to anger, and from anger to the most impassioned love. But now this quiet reserve, this inexpressible sadness affected him more than each and all. It seemed to signify that she was alone in the world, dependent upon her own strength of character, and that to herself only must she look for protectionfrom herself and others. "You see," said she, looking away from hire, as if not daring to be tempted by the loving glance of his eyes; "it was a necessity for me to tell you this; any other course would have been deceitful, and, thank God, I have never forsaken the truth. There is one thing, however, which I cannot tell you (though I have once or twice nearly revealed it to others on the score of duty), why we, loving ,each other as man and woman have seldom loved before, must part. I cannot tell you why I became an actress, and you know there must be perfect confidence between"-she hesitated, while Herbert ended the sentence for her. "Perfect confidence between husband and wife, you 17     386       HELEN COURTENA . would say: can you conceive of anything better, finer, dearer, than the home of married love? Its brief partings, almost sweet, because they point to an early reunion; its new and bewildering emotions; its common ;nterests; its lhours so dreamlike, yet so real; the prayer including two who are but one; the sympathy of mirth; the sympathy of grief; the delicious mystery of affection binding heart to heart; the perfect unreservc, yet the perfect reverence for each other. Ah! Helen," continued he, forgetting or ignoring the barrier which she had raised between them in the glow- ing picture that he had conjured up, "this realization may, nay must be ours." "I said," she answered softly, blushing beneath his ardent gaze, "that there could not be entire confidence between us, and therefore not the crowning jewels of married life. Alas! you could never trust me. The beauti- ful future that you have imagined, presupposes trust, entire trust. Every other thought I could share with you but one; every incident of my past life; some wilful acts; some foolish and many weak ones. Then, too, I could tell you how once I risked my life for yours, when, with desperate purpose, Cornelia Drayton sought your death; all my rela- tions with my cousin Frank Stoddard; the events of my life upon the stage, and everything connected with Dr. Percival. Only one spot on the mirror of my heart would be darkened were you to look at it. Oh, if it were not for this," she added with simple and childlike earnestness, "we might have been so happy!" "God bless you, Helen, for those words," he answered, "they imply a hope; we do, we will trust each other. I have my secret, too. Let the bond between us be this, and for the first and last time it can be said, that two, wedded in perfect accord, had yet one recess of their hearts and beings to which the other was a stranger. Keep your secret why you became an actress to yourself, and let me keep mine, namely, why, knowing that you have been such, I love you the better for it; love you with all the fulness that your exacting nature could desire. Forgive my seeming inconsistency, my wild words at Westminster Abbey, my sweeping denunciation of the stage; only, Helen, accept the terms and be mine."   HELENX COURTEAA Y.       387 Was she awake or dreaming i Entire happiness gained, and her father's memory still pure and intact? "Give yourself into my keeping," she heard him say once more, "oh! Helen, come." With proud consciousness that she was doing right, of her own free will, she bent her steps towards him, and was once more enfolded in his arms without a single struggle to be freed. He had won her at last, for his own. The interview between the lawyer and the witnesses was long, Mr. Gerald having found in one of the latter a com- panion of his boyhood, and when age goes back to the reminiscences of youth, the theme is apt to be attractive. Recalled however to the ;present moment, by the listener to whom their childhood's experiences were by no means as interesting as to themselves, they returned to the matter for which they were summoned.  Shall, we accompany them, as they ascend with heavy tread the stairs leading to the lawyer's den? No, let us leave them to transact the business in their own way, being satisfied with Mr. Gerald's experience and knowledge, and the zeal of the witnesses in behalf of their old friend and his son. For the worthies who had signed their names to the important document, there was but one object in view, the restitution of the property; little did they care in what manner that property was returned, or how Helen had suffered to achieve her end; nor would they have been much interested had they known with what delicate tact Herbert had guarded his knowledge of her father's fraud and her own self-abnegation, or how he had determined, with holy purpose, to devote the fortune which had now become his own, to her who had so nobly relinquished it. They had done their duty; it was all that was required of them, and congratulating the heir upon his unexpected inheritance, they departed. O-     , --     388       HELEN COI UlRTENA' Y. CHAPTER XXXIII. A WEARY passage across the ocean and our tale is done; weary, because we go alone. It was a dreary winter night in London; the storm howled without; the cold, drizzly rain fell unceasingly, but Dr. Percival, seated within his comfortable home, neither felt its depressing influence nor cared for its fury, being in a happy, dreamy mood as he sat before his fire, enveloped in a luxurious dressing-gown, with his feet encased in the most comfortable slippers ever wrought by grateful patient for skilful physician. He was leaning back, with his hands thrown above his head in an easy attitude, and his eyes half closed, while about his lips played a smile as sweet as a pleasant memory could make it. The good man was allowing himself to build castles, as we are wont to do in this matter-of-fact world, using his own colors to paint the picture of his individual drawing. Unclosing his eyes, he looked lovingly towards a little work-table and sewing-chair in a cosy niche, which he had brought to Helen in her convalescence; while fancy, that licensed cheat, beguiled him with the thought that she still graced the sacred corner with her benignant presence. "And why should it not be?" he murmured softly; "how often, even in my daily round of duty, do I see happy end- ings of sorrowful beginnings, while every romance, written or unwritten, brings to pass wonders more striking than this. She promised me in parting that she would come to me in sorrow or in any great strait, and that I should ever be her counsellor and guide. Perhaps she will come, is coming, never, never to leave me more." Opening wide his arms, he embraced the empty air as though it had been a living form, then smiled and sighed at his foolish and unusual content. His meditations were interrupted, however, by a servant, who handed him a letter, the superscription of which he recognised, with great heart-beatings, to be in Helen's hand- writing.   HELEN CO URTENAY I.       389 Then that serene, self-satisfied mood was not a foolish one; it was rather, as he reasoned to himself, a foreshadowing of what was to come. Dr. Percival did not hasten to break the seal, but simply enjoyed the privilege of examining each character of his name, wondering why it had been written, and if it had been penned in joy or sorrow. Like a sick man, allowed some delicious morsel suiting his palate, it was joy enough for a time to taste the pleasures of possession, and after- wards to partake largely of the feast. Besides, he had ever i special reverence for letters, silent converse of the soul rom friend to friend; and to restore a lost communication to give to another a missive which otherwise would not have reached him for whom it was intended, he would have walked or ridden miles. Speech means so little; what is deliberately traced in nk, so much! It is no easy matter to deceive on paper. With enhanced reverence, then, because of its antece- lents, did he regard the cherished memento in his hand, it length unclosing its delicate folds; but even as he read, he glad light died from his face, for its contents quenched he last glimmer of hope in his breast. It told of the return of Frank Stoddard; of Helen's satis- action at the event, because of their near relationship; of Vlay's proposed marriage; of the double happiness of the atter and herself, as the new tie would bring them nearer ogether still; of the resumption of her own name, which low, for the first time, she made known to Dr. Percival, md lastly, of her likewise early marriage with Herbert )rayton. Sadly enough he glanced once more at the corner of his lomestead, dedicated to what he called his " dream-wife," nd for one moment bowed his head like some tall tree mitten by the blast, then raising it again, though not ,roudly, spoke to himself the while in a low tone that soli- ude and years of self-companionship had taught him. "To-morrow," he said, " her little table and chair must se put far from my sight for ever; no thought must return o me of a cheerful fireside and the faces of happy children; he love to have been lavished upon her must be new coined     390       HELEN COURTENA l into deeds (if mercy for the suffering, help for the poor, symnpathy for the distressed, until the passionate earthly memory of her shall have glided into the purest aspirations of the spirit. Farewell to worldly happiness; God be thanked that there is something better; only if Helen - , but hush, rebellious heart, I must dream no more dreams." Thus were his long cherished hopes laid to sleep. "When she had passed, it seemed like the ceasing of ex. quisite music." THE END.
