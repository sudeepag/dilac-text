"I love old houses best for the sake of the odd closets and cupboards, and good, thick walls that don't let the wind blow in, and little out-of- the-way polyaugular rooms with great beams running across the ceil- ing-old heart of oak, that has outlasted half a score of generations."- Sorrr.

MY EARLIEST AND BEST FRIEND, WHOSE AOTBOTO W  EMPABTSF A AUET  EVEY-DA         - IPB^      I   PREFACE. SOME people have a habit of preserving everything that ever belonged to them-old letters among other relics-the more out of date, the more sacred apparently. To one whose life is a present reality, this may seem an unaccountable fancy, yet it is not without its peculiar satisfactions. Dear Miss Margarette Singleside, or, as everybody in the village called her, aunt Margarette, was a genuine devotee to old relics. In one corner of her own chamber-that room which had been her Sanctum from childhood, was a closet, or, as it used to be called in old times, " a cupboard," in which all the gifts and treasures she had accumulated in the course of her life were carefully preserved. On one shelf of this cupboard, was a curiously-carved box, itself an heirloom in the family, brought over doubtless by some of her Puritan ances- tors, in that capacious cabinet of curiosities, the Mayflower. This box was the only thing she did not like to have moved by other hands than her own. When the children of the vil- lage went to pass a Saturday afternoon with aunt Margarette, all the treasures of the odd, little triangular closet were brought out for their inspection, with the exception of this box; of which she kept the key. Some of the older girls, within whose imagination the germs of romance were just unfolding, used to joke with aunt Margarette about the love-letters which they said they knew the box contained, and declared that they had rather take a peep within it, than to see everything else in the closet. She bore their innocent raillery with great good nature, but at the same time, one acquainted with her history might have known how to interpret the flush that spread over her thin,  (v )     VI         ?EFAIE. pale cheek, as the silent depths of memory were stirred by the thoughtless badinage of the merry-hearted children. But it faded as it came, the sudden glow, and the same calm brooded over her features as before. It may be that there were letters within that sealed box, that would reveal the his- tory of her life-long fidelity to one who did not live to repay it by his manly devotion-one in whom all the hope and love of her youth culminated. But the sorrows she chose to conceal, those who loved her can do no less than respect. At my last visit to her, I found her busily employed looking over her closet, and " setting to rights," her treasures. To an outward observer, this was a very mysterious process, and comprehended the putting them wrong first. Still she found a good deal to be done, in adjusting and re-adjusting, packing and re-packing. The truth is, Margarette's life was devoid of incident, and the pleasing excitement of looking over the old reminiscences of past years, was a real gratifica- tion to her. "Here," said she, unlocking the box as she spoke, " here, I have preserved all the letters and manuscripts of our mutual friend Alice Dearbon, including a correspondence of many years-extending back to our school-girl days, and continuing with but slight interruptions, to within a short time of her death. "Of course there is much, which to our mature judgment must appear childish and frivolous in these letters; but I love to read them over even now, and although I should be very unwilling to have them fall into careless hands after my death, I cannot make up my mind to burn them. "I have had it in my thoughts for some time, to give this box into your keeping. There may be something here that you can use. Alice was not an ordinary woman, although she never accomplished in life, the destiny of which she gave early promise. No one was more painfully conscious of her short- comings than herself.   "You knew and loved her. Not as I did, for she was my bosom friend. She was true to me to the last, after most of my early companions were scattered or dead. She confided to me every thought and feeling of her heart. But you loved her well enough to appreciate these relics, and I transfer them to you now, because I feel sure that this is the last time I shall look over my papers. "If you should ever decide to make a book out of these fragments of her life and writings, I rely upon your judgment and discretion, how much it is best to unfold of her domestic history. Her friends were often obliged to be prudent for her, for indeed she had little prudence of her own. Her heart was open as the day; so free from hypocrisy, as often to be misunderstood by cautious and worldly minds. Of herself, she had nothing to conceal, for she did not wish to hide even her faults or her foibles. She desired to be known, and to pass, for what she was, and no more. Yet, few understood her as she was. Those who overrated her, were the friends who loved her best-who saw her capabilities rather than her achievements. Those who depreciated her, were people who are apt to be misled by the glare and glitter of .extraneous ac- complishments, and have not that true insight, which is a key to unlock the secrets of character. But among all those vith whom her lot was cast, she retained, if I mistake not, her freedom from affectation. It troubled her far more to feel that she was over-estimated, than to know she had not justice; while at the same time, she confessed her consciousness of a power latent within, that never had been and never could be brought into action in this world. A heavy weight of trial crushed the buoyancy of her youth, and her peculiar tempera- ment predisposed her to sadness and introspection. "But let me not speak of her in tones of regret. Life became brighter to her as she advanced. The clouds which had enveloped her youth rolled back, and the serene light of Heaven poured in upon her soul, and she found peace."     viii         PREFACE. I need not say with what real pleasure I received these re- membrances of our mutual friend; and it has been a pleasant task, to select from the letters transferred to my care, enough to form a short biography, which may be read perhaps, with real heart-interest at some quiet fireside, where her living presence would have found a welcome and a benediction. EDITOR. CINCINNATI, Oct. 26, 1855.   THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. HERE I am, perched on a hill as hard to climb as "the steep where Fame's proud temple shines afar." Put right down upon it-and the trouble is, instead of trying to gain entrance into the temple, I am all the time looking away down the sides of the hills, and off into the pleasant valleys beyond. O dear! what will become of me in this straight line marked out for me? How can I exist, shut up in this awful building called the Academy, six hours a day? How shall I learn to walk through this one straight street, with tall, white houses on one side, and a row of public buildings on the other How can I go to and return from school on these beaten paths chalked off for me, through the common? How shall I ever learn to be a very proper young woman, and so many people watching me-looking out for faults too-can you help me, Margarette? You ask me to describe the place. I cannot do it. I am always looking beyond it into the green woods, where I long to be. What am I here for? To get my education. In that great building yonder, it is locked up somewhere, and I am to find it. That sombre, lugubrious-looking man there, is to help me, and if I can't succeed, he is to (9)     10    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, crush me, and he can do it. Yet it is a pretty place out- side the houses. All the little breezes that run riot among the leaves on a summer day, are at home here; and blustering Boreas takes up his winter-quarters in the old woods, sweeping over the hills through the long nights, piling the snow in huge drifts, uprooting the trees, blow- ing off roofs and thundering above the chimneys in a manner that would affright any but " the oldest inhabi- tant." Do I like the place, you ask Pretty well; but I yearn for the green meadows of our own quiet valley, and for the freedom with which I was allowed to wander whole days among the woods and by the brooks. I don't know whether it is the old home or the dear friends I most long for, but I think if you were here, this place would seem more beautiful. They tell me this academy is one of the oldest in New England, and has fitted more of our distinguished men for college than any other institution in the country. This does not make it sublime in my eyes. You know I am not fond of study, and I have no head for figures and dates; I have not a verbal memory, and only retain what is made interesting to me. Mr. Stonecraft, the teacher, makes nothing interesting to mle. My reputation for being a wild and troublesome child, which always precedes me everywhere, I found had been received here; and I am treated accordingly. Before I discovered this fact, I thought I would set about a reform, but I soon found it was of no use trying. It is hopeless to work against prejudice. My teacher hates and despises me. If he liked me I should improve under him. Once in a while I try to do well for the sake of doing well, and for my own satisfac- tion; but the old Adam is continually being aroused   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE.  1] within me by the injustice and severity with which he treats me; and not content with making me miserable at school, he must needs excite the- indignation of my friends at home against me, that I may have joy nowhere. I sigh to think how hard it is, not to be loved. My own heart is full of love and I long to be permitted to show it. Shall I ever be able to act without restraint  But I have my consolation. I live in two worlds--one outward and compelled, the other in my own heart and imagination. All I want, to make the last perfect, is sympathy; but I am ashamed to speak of sympathy, because people ridicule me. Dear Lucy A--, you know her, she is older by many years than I am, and is dying with consumption. She loved me and had a way of showing it that went to my heart. I always liked to hear advice from her. She told me to shun the habit of day- dreaming; to read, to work, to live out of myself, to do anything but dream. But how can I live out of myself, when the very moment I make a home with others, they frown me back upon myself? -but I must speak out, I should die if I could not. I take my pen and try to ex- press myself in poetry. I think God meant me to be a poet. When I read the poetry of others, I feel so much in myself that I long to utter. I feel that I should speak if there were no human ears to hear me, because it is within me and  must come out. The trouble is it doesn't come out the same that it is within. My verses are poor and cold, but they make my heart lighter, and perhaps in time I shall learn to write better, that others may feel what I say., ok   *    ' ,*   X    * I hear so often that I am a troublesome, wilful girl, that I am half-tempted to believe it. Troublesome I may     be, and I suppose I am; but wilful I am not, unless pro- voked beyond endurance. My teacher continues his per- secutions. He looks daggers at me. Sometimes it rouses Buch an evil spirit within me, I sit and think. of the torments I should like to inflict upon him. If the wicked- ness and cruelty were not first in him, it would never be in me. Hatred and contempt look out of his eyes and ooze out of his lips when he speaks to me. I am a stupid scholar, but nobody can accomplish much, who is never  encouraged. I am not happy. My companions are friendly, but I crave something more than their com- panionship. I want to be led by a stronger nature, not driven, I am beyond my schoolmates in many things, although they are far in advance of me in book learning. You ask me about my relations. They are kind. They do all for my good, but I see they have more fear than  hope on my account. They are apprehensive that I shall never do anything or be anything, that I shall not turn out well. They are strong-minded people. They pride them- selves upon their force of character. I guess it runs in the family to have a good opinion of ourselves. They are independent, plain-spoken, sometimes too much so, in my opinion. They are not given to caresses or endear- ments, to words of tenderness or encouragement. Exter- nally they are cold and hard, but I know they have warmth within. I say I know it, but I do not feel it. Young people need the spoken word, the tender look, the fond caress, and the approving smile. I know if I had it, I should be better, and, O! much happier. Nobody ever kisses me. Nobody ever puts a loving arm around my neck, as your mother does to you. I suppose I am foolish to long for such things, but God made me so. I   -- '., ^-^ x, ( J/ iVAiKYX-DAY PEOPLE. 13    A know my relations love me as well as they can, seeing  that I am, as everybody says, a troublesome girl. To day is my fifteenth birthday. I have been away on a visit to an aunt, who lives in the most charming spot you ever saw. A friend of mine came from town to see us. She drove out with a young gentleman from B-. He seemed to take a liking to me, and said very pretty things which put me in a flutter. I am not used to it, you know. Besides that, he took a real interest in my poetical efforts, and praised me for something he had read, which Miss D---  had shown him. What a plea- sure it was to know that anybody, he particularly, liked my verses. I understand now what a stimulus to im- provement such commendation is. I am not ambitious, but when one likes my verses, I feel they understand me. In the afternoon, we sailed on the lake. Mr. Coburn, that is my new friend's name, rowed the boat along the shore. The waters were crimson with the glowing twilight; life seemed full of poetry-too full! it made me sad. I couldn't talk. I knew I could not express what I felt, and that only made me sadder. I sang after we re- turned to the house. Mr. Coburn praised my voice. Here now is somebody that likes me in spite of my being a poor scholar, and a wild girl. I was happy to know that he liked me; and my happiness must have made me look well, for he said, (I believe it will look very silly written, but you will excuse it,) I was beautiful; and when I went up-stairs, I looked in the glass, and really I never saw myself look so well. I felt a greater respect for myself than I ever had done, and resolved that I was a young lady, and wouldn't be put down any more. I hoped Mr. O -  would come out again to see us. ITe said he would. I learned after I went away, that my "-    '  -     "    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR), aunt sent a remonstrance to him through Miss D ---. She was afraid we might fall in love with each other. I must say, I don't see the harm even if we had. O! how watchful they are of me. Here I am again, but no longer a school-girl. Fifteen years old, and my education finished, as far as school is concerned. Now for learning housekeeping. I like to work well enough; cooking comes naturally to me, but I have moods of hating it. I am always finding heroes; you know, even at school I had my beaux. I cannot see any harm in it; it seems all innocent and natural to me, but my friends think otherwise, so I take very little pleasure after all, in being admired, except in the consciousness that I am so. My loves are not very deep; my heroes are disrobed of their enchantments very suddenly sometimes. I suppose when I really fall in love, it will be something different. But these make life poetical, and mine needs something to en- liven it. The actual, with me, is dull and prosy. You ask me if I am happier now than I used to be as a school-girl. No, dear, I think I am less happy. I used to have intimations of sadness then, which were not really sadness, but now, I am often really sad. Life disappoints nme; it is not what I thought it would be; I feel dissatis- fied with myself. I aspire to something better than I have yet known, but I know not how to attain it. I am not happy, and the want of some one to whom I can un- bosom myself, grows deeper and deeper.. I think if such a friend I had, who would hear all I have to say; some one older and wiser, who could help me, I might be some. thing yet. It seems to me I am a kind of isolated being. You laugh at me about Frank Duncan, and ask if he   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE.  15 is one of my heroes. No--yes-I don't know. I think he is fast becoming a hero. He says he feels the deepest in- terest in me. He is a great favorite of everybody here teachers and all; and yet, I think they overrate him. If he really likes me so much as he says he does when we are alone, why is he afraid or ashamed to let others see it  Nobody need be ashamed to like me. His non-committal- ism gets me-into difficulty sometimes with my relations. *    *     *    -*    * Life looks more and more mysterious to me every year. I am a joy to no one; I make no one's heart glad, and my own is seldom so. I am  only happy when I live in my own thoughts, or when I write, but everything I write is sad.  What can it mean? Is reality so sad a thing? Then let me live in dreams. I have read of unhealthy minds; I fear my mind is becoming unhealthy, but where is the physician that can heal it-? If I were reli- gious, should I not be happy? But what is religion, and how am I to find it? Religion should make people kind gentle, forgiving, sympathizing. I don't find that it makes people in general, all this. The prayer my mother taught me, is not enough.  It doesn't ease my heart. I sometimes think I will tell all my wants, all my griefs and joys to God; but he sees my heart and knows them without my telling. If you are religious, do help me. I take the Bible and read; I mean to do it every day, for it was my  mother's dying injunction, but sometimes I forget it. I  cannot understand it. Now and then I meet with some verse that I can understand, and feel; then my heart prays to God for more light. This is the coldest of winter nights. The ground is white with snow, and the moon is bright and full. All the folks have gone to bed, and I have been sitting by     16    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; O, the fire writing, till I am in a nervous tremor. I am afraid almost of my own shadow. A dark figure has just passed enveloped in a cloak; the only living thing awake andstirring. I know who it is; I know why he passes the widow, and he knows I see him. He knew he should see me. He has a strange influence over me, with his dark, deep-set eyes; but there is something in him I do not quite like. ile has not impulse, enthusiasm enough. By-and-by, he will act from expediency, and with aregard to what others will say. I cannot forgive him for not walking before the windows in the light of day to see me, and for allowing it to be said, that I seek him. I never sought him. le knows that he seeks me. He is not half so fiank as I am, and a great deal more worldly. He says I am too impulsive; that he fears for my future; that I shall be "like a rudderless ship in perilous seas." But he is a rock; I don't think I shall be wrecked there. Only to think of my surprise yesterday, in seeing two of my poems in print, and receiving three dollars by mail from the publisher. I knew in a moment who did it. I have never forgotten the sail on the pond, that pleasant summer evening. There was a young man who was not ashamed to be seen looking at me. I wonder if I shall ever see him again. Here I am again in my native place, no longer a child, no longer a school-girl, invited to parties and balls and rides. I suppose it is a fine thing to be a young lady. I begin to hope I shall be happy now. Miss Howard has left school too, and has just come out; she is very beautiful and much admired. I hear that some people say I am the better looking of the two, but I think she bears off the palm; and she is rich. How provoking it is to be poor.   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 17 If I had money now, wouldn't I do something? Instead of that, I must do something to make money. What can I do best? Teach music I suppose. You would be astonished if you knew how I dreaded it; I am so proud. It is false pride I know, but I can't root it out. Next week I shall begin, and you shall hear how I get along. The ordeal is past. I have three pupils who come to me. I find I must study myself, before I can teach others. Miss Howard came to pay a call while I was giving a les- son. How awkward and ashamed I felt. Poverty is hateful What a contemptible spirit I havel I must get over it. I suppose Miss Howard and perhaps some others, feel above me because they are not obliged to exert themselves. She can play the fine lady, dress tastefully, etc., etc. I must make the most of the capital I have. I have been summing up the items. First, a good-looking face, clear brunette complexion, small, but expressive eyes-at least, that is what Mr. Coburn told me-rosy cheeks and a pleasant mouth, though rather large. My figure is not very good. I am by no means a sylph, but I have seen girls more awkward. My looks are well enough, and I am satisfied, since I cannot alter them. As to the internal, I have-at least so people say-good gifts, an aptitude at versification, abundance of sentiment, and a warm heart. I feel a good-will towards everybody, and I should like to show it, but I am somewhat bashful and sheepish. I am rather diffident of myself, yet not wanting in self-esteem, as is manifest, when others withhold from me what I consider my just due. I write very foolishy, but my heart is not in it. At the bottom of all this nonsense, there lies still a feeling of discontent. I am not satisfied with my life, but I 2     10o   'itJa VlJU UVLLVJi(JDa Vu)rUjv oJCL ui v,  don't know how to make it better. Some of my young friends are very good, pious girls. They never go to balls; they think amusements sinful. I cannot agree with them. Then say that dancing is a poor preparation for death. To me, it seems an innocent amusement and natural to life; and as to a preparation for death, I don't understand what it means. I have a feeling that God meant us to enjoy the innocent pleasures which belong to youth. The young animals frisk about with an overflow- ing delight; the birds sing for joy, and even the fish in the brook glide about for nothing but gladness; and why shouldn't young people like to dance for the same reason? I may change my mind when I am older. The secret of my discontent lies deeper than this; it is because I have no definite object in life. Perhaps I am not old enough yet to have one. I suppose I never shall have, till I am married; but what if I never marry  To-day has been a sad time. Ellen Rosevelt was buried this afternoon from the church. She was just my age. She had been sick a long, long time and none of her young friends had been permitted to visit her. 1 well remember how she looked the last time I saw her in the family par- lor. Her beautiful face was whiter than alabaster, and her dark hair was combed plain and twisted in a little knot behind. She looked like a Madonna, only that there was no happiness in her face. I remember what she said: "The highest virtue we can attain in this life, is resignation." She felt so at the time, but she had not been made perfect through suffering. Afterwards, when her bodily anguish was more intense, and she knew that nothing could save her, a higher revelation of God's love came to her. She became sweetly patient and' cheerful. Her thoughts were all of others. She employed her time   iLtN i NVEIgY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 1 and strength in making garments for the poor. Long after she was confined to her bed she sewed, propped up by pillows. A few days before her death, she became a member of the Church and received the communion. The nearer she approached her home, the more bright the way became to her, and she heard with joy the Lord's invitation, "Come unto me." She went without fear. The shadows, which had hung above herspirit, cleared away, and light from heaven streamed in upon her soul. All her young friends were at the funeral. "H ow solemn it is!" said Aynette Brown to me as we left the church. Was my soul dead that I did not feel the solemnity No. I almost envied her. Human life is before me with its temptations and trials. I may fall, I may be over- whelmed, and drag out years of sorrow and regret; but she is safe. I do-not find life so rich. I say to myself often-Is this all? I have reached the age that promised so much, and where is the joy I thought to feel? . The paths that I longed to be treading, Long since have I traversed them o'er; But where is the light that shone round them, The beauty and freshness they wore? Last night I went to the weekly meeting of our Book Club. I think I have told you about this association for mutual improvement and social intercourse. Almost every family of our acquaintance belongs to it. The yearly subscription is two or three dollars -I am never accurate in dollars and cents. With the funds we buy books, which are circulated among the members and then collected to form a library. Our meetings are .for social chat, music, and to hear our own smart productions read aloud. We have every variety of literary effort; some very grand and high-sounding, others of a humbr.     ous character, and others still of a sentimental cast. Of course, mine belong to the latter class. I have no reason- ing powers, no humor; nothing but a kind of poetic sen- timent. Cold shivers ran all over me while my piece was being read, and I could hardly help choking. I suppose everybody knew it to be mine. I brought the book home containing the Articles and laid it on the parlor table. The next day father came into the sitting-room where I was, and asked me who wrote that piece of poetry called ' Early Friends. "  My heart began to beat, and I answered as well as I could: "I did,"' "gHem!" said my father and walked out of the room. Not a word of praise, not the slightest indication of liking it. How mortified I felt! I knew that was his way, and that he never would have told me he liked it under any circum- stances. I concluded that he thought me a fool. I went and read it over. It read pretty well, but did it mean anything? "Early friends!" What are all mine but early friends? and are they not mine now as much as ever? Anybody might think me fourscore, and to have outlived all my early attachments. A new light seemed to open on my mind. Have I not been feeding my- self with sickly forebodings? anticipating misfortune.? Now, thought I, I will have done with this nonsense and write in earnest and from the heart. The next evening I mustered courage to ask my step-mother if she ever heard father say what he thought of the piece. She said he liked it very much, and she thought he was proud of its being mine. I was too happy; but why could he not have praised it to me? l How much good it might have done me! Somebody had told me once that he was very proud of me! What a thrill of joy ran through me, when I heard it! but I could not help feeling it would be better in many ways, if he could show it to me. But   ..-- '  -JAx IUPE OF EVERY DAY PEOPLE.       ,f our family never show their feelings to each other. I will copy the verses for you, but remember, when you read them, I am   but sixteen, and you "must not expect one of my age," etc. I will criticise it as I go along to save you the trouble. Our early friends How warm their love Ere selfish dreams steal on, And fancy's gorgeous coloring Of future years is gone. Ere tried in sorrow's school the heart, Or learned the mournful truth That life brings many aload of care We cannot know in youth. O happy youth 1 no sordid hope Of gain attracts and binds; But all the treasure that it seeks, The trusting spirit finds-(Quory.) A free return of generous love, For love bestowed as free; And raptures, never found again, That spring from sympathy. NozT.--Preeous ttle of that rapture have I known in reality. Our early friends! a happy band! Slow, oft, in after years, They come, like angel visitonts, Amid our griefs and tears; Till we, forgetting every pang, Live only in the past, And clasp them, beautiful and young, As when we saw them last. The friends of childhood's sunny hours Are severed from our side; Distance or jarring interest The warmest hearts divide. We meet them in the busy world, In pleasure's wild career, And as we pass, almost forget That they were ever dear. Norm.-At least people ay we do, andI presume, I shall find it io to my sorrow, ough now, thank heaven I it is only an Imaginary trial.     ;D'd   GTHE OLD CONEi CU'J3SOAJt1; UJ)  Our early friends I How still their sleep Of death, where never more The softest breath of summer air Can their lost bloom restore. We linger where their feet have been, We listen for their voice, And yearn for tokens of their love- Which made us once rejoice. So must it be, as life steals on, From off our changeful track; Those early friends pass one by one, Whence none can call them back; And then we turn aside to weep, That there are left so few Of the bright forms and loving hearts We prized when life was new. Who will not cherish then the ties Of early, happy years, To soothe the heart bowed down with grief, And chase away our tears? And who, that o'er the varied past, His busy memory sends, Will not, through sorrow and regret, Still bless his early friends? I anticipate your criticism, you perceive.  I write as if I were sixty instead of sixteen; that is, the spirit belongs to one who has had a long and sorrowful life of trial and bereavement, whereas I never lost but one friend by death, and none by estrangement. The friends of childhood's sunny hours have never been severed from my side, and what reason have I to anticipate such calamities      No reason in the world. Rhyme is not reason. Somehow there is a luxury in being sad, after all, and in conjuring up calamities. You make me ashamed of my own indolence when you give an account of all you accomplish; what is the secret of your happiness?   I know you will say, constant em- ployment-persevering    industry.  Is this virtue yours   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 23 by nature or by grace How did you learn it? I accom- plish a good deal, but I do it by fits and starts. I work hard while I work, that I may get through; and when I get through, I am uneasy from the want of some new object to work for. Sometimes I think it will be sweet to have a whole day to myself, to go off into the woods and read and muse and write poetry. So I try it, and off I go, occa- sionally with a friend, but oftener alone. But I don't find the delight. I wander by the mill-stream--plunge into the wood--get my hands full of flowers-sit on the shady side of some green slope, and take out a book, a poem, or a novel, and think I shall by-and-by find myself on the summit of happiness, but, instead of that, the flies or the musquitoes, or the heat, or something else, annoy me, and scatter my fine fancies to the winds. I look down at the river and up at the sky, until I feel stupefied. Then I fancy a sleeping dream would be more welcome than a waking one; but, if I lie on the ground, the worms may crawl into my ears, or the great spiders drop down upon me from the trees. Some cows at a distance fill me with dread, and the idea of a mad dog suddenly pre- sents itself to my imagination. This being the climax of horror, I can't think of staying any longer, notwithstand- ing that by this time, the noontide blaze is hottest. So I go home, and take a long nap. In the cool of the evening I think it all over, and I see the streams and the hills through the softening light of memory, and then I feel the rapture. What I seek flies from me ever-the glory lies before me in hope, or behind me in memory. It is seldom present with me. When it is, it comes un- sought. Unfold me this riddle, and tell me if there is no reality of bliss in life? pss      and the days are tting shorter Summer has passed, and the days are getting shorter * *          it     itt    *JH1JB VJLU A ULJLJJWM m?Upr$EVMJAU J V6tt and shorter. Aunt E--  has sent me a package of books to read this winter-history and biography. She is desirous that I should know something. I fear it is a hopeless case. I care little about these old musty kings and queens that were always picking quarrels with each other, and full of all manner of mischief. I shall never  be a literary woman-I am always losing the thread of history-I am very much afraid I shall never know much. Very little book-learning adheres to my memory. We have had a round of parties this winter, which I profess to have enjoyed very much, although this terrible annoyance of small means has prevented me from dress- ing as tastefully as I should like. I have great ideas of becomingness in dress, and picture myself in divers cos- tumes that I think would set me off finely, but the reality of my apparel is very simple. I shall be glad after all when the gayety is at an end; for if others are not tired of seeing me, I am weary of myself always in the same garb. I try to vary it as much as I can by divers bows and trimmings, but to very little purpose. However, if the object of dressing up for company is what it is said to be, the being admired by gentlemen, I have nothing to complain of, although Miss Howard certainly is the "bright particular star," in our firmament. But seriously there is very little satisfaction in parties. I am convinced I was never meant to shine in society. I have no conversation--no quickness of repartee. The smart things I might have said, always come too late. What am I good for? what am I meant for? That is a question. M   thinks 1 should be good for a wife. Perhaps so, but not for him. When will the right one present himself? I have so many fancies, but they are fleeting as the dew. They come at evening and often   disappear by broad daylight. M- says I expt too much rapture, and all that sort of thing. Perhaps so; but I will expect a *hile longer befre I tae up with any- thing less. History does not progress rapidly. I read enough, but I am always losing my place, and do not discover from one day to another, except that I am no nearer the end of the volume, that I keep reading the tSame pages over and    atd ga the same pages over and over. Other pages are more attrac. tive to me. The fresh, bright page of nature, and the mysterious page of my own heart, written all over with hieroglyphics that I puzzle over and try to decipher, bnt cannot. It 's no use trying to make a learned womaa of -me, I lak the ambition. You will wonder at my many changes. Indeed I bave no abiding-place, and never had; but may I never find myself with less agreeable surroundings than at present I ought to feel light-hearted here; and today I do. Thi mountain region is charming; the air is bracing and re; the scenery varied and beautiful; but the people, afer all, that is the grand desideratum--te people are after my own heart. So cordial, so affectionate, so full of all warm sympathies, and so fiee from conventionalities I might add, so cultivated and intelleectual-,but that is a matter of course, for here I am in the midst of the most literay circle in New England, authors and, aunthoresses in the very house with me. Bless me! how much they know! I should be suffocated with the weight of this literary atmosphere, if it were not kept in perpetual and healthy motion by the affections--surrounded by books on every side. Books up-stairs and books down-stairs; books inV the halls and books in the dining-room. I feel that I must begin to read and study in earnest. Some of these learned people might expect me to joi' in their conver. 3     26     THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD ; ORB sation; but where shall I begin? Would it not be best at once to give out, I know nothing? Such frankness is rare, and who knows but it would be quite taking? Or, shall I preserve a modest silence, and, perhaps, pass for one who knows a great deal. But suppose somebody should ask me a question Well, I can feign abstraction. If the conversation is intensely learned I should not be obliged to feign it; but, if feigned, I might suddenly start up and leave the room (eccentric geniuses always go by starts) and by some fanciful idea of my own, and by my vagaries in general, perhaps I might pass for a genius. Seriously, I feel the strivings of an honorable ambition to deserve the good opinion of my friends, and what the desire for fame could never accomplish, the love of these dear people may inspire. I am convinced they overrate my capacity, but I will strive to come up to the standard of their appreciation. My poetical efforts are highly ap- plauded. A new feeling is awakened within me, to write something that may reach other hearts--to create a bond of sympathy in many minds-to send these children of my heart and brain abroad, and find them warmed and cher- ished by many a soul, ready and eager to receive them. This would be sweet; but shall I ever be able to accom- plish it I Would it not take away this feeling of loneli- ness I have, thus to be met and understood? I long to do it, but is it not beyond my power? If anything out- ward could inspire me, it would be these hills and lakes upon which I gaze at this moment from the piazza where I am writing. Sleeping in quiet beauty at my right is a little gem, named "The Mountain Mirror," where, at the first flush of morning, the green hills look down upon their veiled loveliness, and throw their cool shadow over its surface throughout the summer day. But I won't tire you with descriptions of scenery, except to copy a   THEE EVERY-DAY LIFE OC  EVERY-DAY PEOPLE.    2  fragment of verse which I scribbled the other day; but do not try to build the fair fabric of my future fame upon its merits, or think that I send it as a type of what I shall yet accomplish. Take it for what it is-the bub- bling over of a full heart that has not yet learned how to express itself. 'Tis morning and the mist hangs o'er the plain Like a cloud-woven curtain-now it Rarts, And rising slowly, emerald islands gleam From out the filmy tissue, newly born- And tremulous 'neath the smile of the young day. Ascending still, like a dissolving cloud, It melts into the deep blue of the sky; And all the meadows and the wooded hills Spread their green freshness to the noonday sun. The little flowers lift up their drooping heads, And give their incense to the silent air; And birds start up from out the shadowy-woods, And pour their hearts out in full notes of joy. I, too, am joyous, and the tide of life That dances through my veins and swells my heart, Would overflow in music full of hope,  Had I the spell -to clothe my thought in words- But I  have not, and, therefore, I end ai I began, in an aspiration--would to heaven it were an inspiration. Still you ask me, with something  too of reproach-are you not happy now?    If you had not asked, I should have said nothing about it; but if I answer at all, truth compels me   to say no-not happy--for happiness, as I  drea m of it, comprehends a great deal which I have not yet attained. I do not covet tumultuous and overwhelming joy, but deep and silent repose--yes, that is the word, rose. Of raptures, I   have my share I  presume. I  am  intensely happy   at times, but I dream  of something-higher. Peace, that is the idea. I am too restless, too unequal too subject to ups and downs.  There is a  middle state, which seems in every way more desirable-,not to lose the capacity for' ,.     the deepest and strongest emotion, but to have acquired that control over myself, that I can say to the swelling tide, "thus far and no farther." I should like to be bathed in bliss, but not drowned in it; you understand me. I still drudge on with my teaching, but never shall be forehanded, as the Yankees say. I am working now, to pay old scores; at the same time, running up new ones, to be paid hereafter. However, I find when I have no money in my purse, I never think of wanting anything. The moment it is well-filled, I cannot enumerate my ne. cessities, and never know what I can do without, till my funds are exhausted. My fellow-lodgers are numerous and varied. My dear companion on the first floor, is younger a few years than I am, and gifted like myself, with an ease of versifica- tion. We talk by the hour in rhyme, suiting the measure to the subject; now grave and stately, and again, as lighter themes suggest themselves, running glibly over the short lines, and so prodigal of rhymes, you would think we studied nothing but the rhyming dictionary. We are enough alike, to enjoy being sentimental together. She is really in advance of me, because she has a vigorous intellect, as well as a poetical temperament. She studies and thinks; I muse and sentimentalize. She has fine eyes, and when her hair is braided and wreathed around her head, in a certain fashion peculiar to her, she looks like a sibyl. We have some beaux, of course, but not of the stuff that heroes are made of. We are now working upon a large tent of unbleached cloth, to shelter us when we go out pic-nic-ing. But the greatest excitement we have at present, is in the anticipation of Mrs. Derby's arrival. What we expect to see, it would be difficult to say. A woman of great genius, great beauty, great   -   .-.'..... VA .lvx-VAY .PEOPLE. 29 eminence, and, decided eccentricities--so we are told. She is expected daily. She is to occupy the room that opens on the piazza, our trysting place and evening pro. menade; where we always go, to discuss the beauties of nature, recite our rhymes, and reveal our secrets. Will she descend from her pinnacle to speak to us?     d    *    *     The great event has taken place. She has come! I have seen her! spoken to her! I will tell you all about it. I had thrown myself on the bed to muse, and per- chance to sleep; in fact, I had fallen into a doze, from which I was awakened by such tones of music, as I never heard before; not that the voice itself was faultless but its pathos and power thrilled through and through me-" d tere's to the year that's awa'." I started up, and rushed to Mary's room. She has come, and I hear her singing, I exclaimed; and we sat listening, with ears and soul open, as if afraid of losing a note. Yes, it was she, it could be no other. Our room was no longer large enough to hold us, and we flew to the piazza, to unbur- then our hearts. The music ceased. We walked pIst the windows, and there she sat, leaning over her writing- table. Never have I seen sucha face; it is more than handsome; genius glows in every lineament. She did not see us; if she had, she might well have rebuked our impertinent curiosity. What right had we to be gazing in upon her with our wide-open eyes? We were invited to Mrs. Grey's, to meet her in the evening. What an even- ing itwas; such singing of old ballads, that made the flesh creep. Of course, we can think and talk of nothing else at present. The village is now full of strangers for it is a summer resort for city people.

Next week there is to be an excursion-an explor- ing expedition. I am invited, thanks to Mrs. Derby. Is it not flattering to be the object of her kind attention  I am going. Let me see, who will comprise the party: Mr. and Mrs. Grey, sons and daughters; the two Misses S--; Miss V--; Mr. W--, who has written a book and plays on the flute, and talks sentimentally to very young ladies; Mr. R--, who is also a genius and will write a book sometime, doubtless; Miss 0-- , a splen- did Roman-looking girl; two or three school-girls, and myself. We are to go in carriages and on horseback, and to be absent a week. What bliss in anticipation! I wonder if the reality will prove as delightful. I will tell you all about it when I return. Here I am at home again, and now I think it all over, I am convinced we had a splendid time. The heat, the dust, and the musquitoes don't trouble me now. Memory has no legs to be weary, or head to be heavy. Memory can climb the longest hill and not faint, sit under the hottest sun and not melt-Yes, we enjoyed the expedition highly. The first setting out with flying colors, horses in good condition, the fresh morning air, the beautiful scenery, the poetic associations-for we passed by the homes of two, at least, of our American poets. We rode by the side of Green River, where, "When breezes are soft and skies are fair, the poet loved to "Steal an hour from study and care, And hie him away to the woodland scene, Where wanders the stream with its waters of green; As if the bright fringe of herbs on its brink Had given their hue to the waves they drink."   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVpEY-DAY PEOPLE  31 We passed the first night in Canaan-may it not be the i   last that I set foot therein. It was a romantic night, a romantic place, a romantic hour, and we were romantic people. We strayed by moonlight to the Falls, so called probably because there was every preparation made but water to form cascades, and that, for lack of rain, was wanting. Some few silver threads wandered over the I   gray masses of rock, like straggling moonbeams, and rippled along the bed of what, in spring, may have been a stream; but now it was so dry that we seated ourselves in the very middle of it, and with the full moon shining over us, listened to Mr. W----'s flute and Mrs. Derby's singing, and also-can you believe it? to my feeble turn. ming of the strings of my guitar. I had the honor also of singing with Mrs. Derby that duett, "Drink to me only with thine eyes," which was very appropriate, as we could not have slaked any other than "The thirst that from the soul doth rise." ix IThe third day we reached the summit of the mountain we had come to visit; where a little thread of water pre- cipitates itself into a natural basin, the distance of several feet. Imagine it as high as you please, for I never could. calculate by feet, nor remember distances. It was high enough to make one giddy to look down from above, and blind to look up from below. It was an intimation of a cataract; all it needed was water; but the hill itself was magnificent. I can tell you now without the least fatigue, how we ascended, Indian file, to the summit, laid our lengths on the ground and looked down over the edge of the precipice; and when we were satisfied with that, how we retraced our steps and went -beneath the rocks and     32     THE OLD CORNER OUPBOARD; OR, looked up in the very face of a noonday sun, and then, after resting awhile, how we ate our dinner under the trees, and got into our vehicles and drove through the woods "By the side of a murmuring stream ;'- and how we got out and bathed in the cold water that the sun of summer never warms, choosing the deep gullies among the rocks, in which to plunge, and then rode on expecting to pick up those who had straggled on before; and our horror and consternation to find Mrs. Derby was missing. I don't think she lost herself on purpose'to get up a scene, and yet I in my simplicity may have been gulled. And then, when we arrived at last, dusty and tired at the village inn, how the people stared at us, wondering what sent us there. Poor country folks I they had no idea what a chase cultivated people will take for pleasure, and what inconveniences they will put up with, in the search for happiness. They gave us a good supper, and as good beds as the house afforded, and sleep was none the less sweet, from the circumstance of our being stowed away, the greater number of us, in one room. Well, we are home again, and as I have tried to believe, it was all very charming and very delightful. I want you to think so too, partly for my sake, and partly for the sen- timent of the thing. I daresay, I shall write some verses about it some day, when it has become altogether a thing of memory, and I have rested from the fatigue of the excursion. I wonder if anybody really enjoyed at the time, what he anticipated; or, if I am the only person that is always seeking and never finding. My excellent friend, Mr. P--, said to me once: "Happiness is not-found in seeking it, but in seek- ing something else." It does not lie in green fields, or   THE BVBY-DAY F LI OF WBERY-DAY PEOPLE. 38 blue skies, in waterfalls or running brooks. The eye sees all these lovely pictures, but the soul must feel them, and to excite happiness, the soul must be in harmony with nature. Let the instrument be in tune, and every ray of sunshine, every motion of the summer wind will waken sweet music from the quivering strings. But how shall we keep it in tune t I have my ideas on this point, but they are too vague to be expressed. When the heart sees God in every object in nature--feels his love in every throb of joy, as well as-sorrow; aspires towards Him in every thought; lives, moves and has its being in Him-- that is happiness. Then every object of beauty has a meaning that reaches up towards the Infinite; then there is a soul in everything. I have jested about my own incapacity to find in nature all I seek; but apart from this frivolous way of 'speaking, or rather writing, I acknowledge to you, I am angry with myself, that little annoyances, such as flies and musquitoes, lassitude and heaviness, should shut up the avenues of enjoyment to my inner being. Last night, we had a treat. I sometimes complain that I do not enjoy enough; but I cannot say I am not enough wretched when I listen to such a tale of woe as I heard last night read aloud, by Mrs. Derby. The production Was her own, founded upon actual occurrences, and de. scribed with a power and pathos, that nothing less than genius could give. I endured as long as I could, the read- in of one scene after another, of misery and remorse, and then broke down entirely. I rushed into another room, and hung out of the window, watering the ground with my tears, and making the darkness audible with my sobs. I was ashamed of myself, but I could not help it. By- and by, Mrs. Derby came to me, and putting her arm     34     THE OLD OORNER CUPBOARD; OR, around my waist, said very sweet things to cheer me. I certainly had paid her the highest compliment I was able to give, and with the most unequivocal sincerity. That night, she took me into her own apartments, where I slept on the floor, in a room adjoining hers. I wore her night-cap, but on awaking the next morning, I did not find my brain teeming with new and beautiful fancies, or vivid imaginations. Alas! could I for the wishing, have had the genius of her to whom it belonged, would I have accepted the gift? Would such a brilliant career, would the homage of multitudes, would the consciousness of power, satisfy my soul? Does it satisfy hers I No, I am not ambitious. These are not mere words. A quiet home-life, the love of friends, and the smile of Heaven, my constant companion -this is sweeter than fame; sweeter than the world's applause. So Bessie is to be married soon! That attachment, on the whole, comes nearer to my ideal of a love-match, than any I have met with in real life. I love them both-they seem to have the innocence and trust of children, with the reflection and stability of maturity. They are suited to each other, and how happy they are in each other's love I When I asked Bessie the last time I saw her, what book of poetry she was reading, she answered, "( She had no need of books of poetry. Life was all poetry." And so it is to her, now. That handsome young man, with his dark eyes and hair, wooing in true lover's fashion, with music and flowers, like the knights of olden romance. Well, some souls are born, no doubt, for each other; and is not Linnwood just the spot for lovers? and Bessie's home just the home for romance?

I can almost fancy the odor of the seringa floating past me at this moment, and I dream I am   standing, an invisible spectator at that southern window, where I have stood often with Bessie and I watch her, as her soft blue eyes gaze out upon the mountains with a dreamy delight.      She knows, as the twilight deepens, he will appear and beckon her to come down and wander with him      along the sequestered paths, where the silent stars alone can be witness of their joy. What sentiment for me! But confess it is no more than the facts of the case warrant. You   say you  like to read my verses once in a while, and, therefore, I send you this serenade, suggested by the idea of this romantic love-affair, and my recollections of Rudolf's singing: Wake, dearest, wake I for the moonbeams are glowing, In light and in beauty o'er forest and hill, The fair Susquehanna is noiselessly flowing-- When o'er the green meadows the night dews distill. The cool breath of evening shall murmur around thee, And blend with my song the sweet incense of flowers;        Then break the soft fetters of sleep which have bound thee, And joy that is sweeter than dreams shall be ours. (You see I was obliged to substitute Susquehanna for our dear Connecticut, in order to fit into that line, and for the sake of euphony.) While the light of our love no dark shadow has shrouded, Each sound that thou hearest will tell thee of joy; For the heart, whose young life is still pure and unclouded, Is a world of delight which no fears can'destroy. But if thou lov'st better the breathings of sadness, If sorrow has blighted one hope that was dear, My heart shall forget its own rapturous gladness, And whisper to thine words of comfort and cheer. Then wake, dearest, wake I 'mid the quiet of even- 'Tis hard to remember that life has its woes; This world. in its beauty, seems almost like heaven, So holy and deep is its breathless repose.     36     THE OLD COBNEB OUPBOARD; OR, Drive not from my heart the illusions that borrow Their brightness from hope, and their sweetness from love; Let our heaven be on earth for to-night-and to-morrow-- If clouds gather here, let our hopes rise above. I generally write from the memory of a by-gone emo- tion. This was a present impulse. I don't know why, but the love of these, my dear, romantic friends, seems to me very poetical and beautiful. Few people could experi- ence just such an attachment. She has grown up like a flower, in her quiet home, shielded from sorrow and temptation-unfolding in an atmosphere of affection, and just as her soul has expanded to womanhood, a new glory clothes the earth and sky, and sinks into the inmost depths of her being. Pshaw! I am going beyond my depth now in sentiment. What day are they to be mar- ried? I wish they would put it off awhile. Are they not happy enough? What a riddle is the human heart; even they are not satisfied with the present. With mar- riage come such realities; such an unmasking, such a dropping off of illusions. Eating and-out upon it!- cooking-sweeping and dusting -every-day business, every-day annoyances, that ruffle the temper; servants that won't do their duty-or homely duties to be done, and no servants-and hosts of natural evils too numerous to mention; then what becomes of moonlight walks and seren- ades! The sweet hours vanished, never come again. Others better and happier may come, but of their nature and quality, I am not prepared to speak. "Things doubtful are very uncertain." If the present is really so charming, why not cling to it? why be forever looking beyond?

I begin to look very sober and matter-of-fact. My young brothers and sisters are growing up around me. I have made one delightful and improving acquaintance, in our new home, that of the clergyman, and the only min- ister I ever dared to talk with. He has a saint-like charac- ter, but, oh! how sad a face he wears I What inward con- flicts must he have passed through to leave such deep traces of suffering! They must have been internal sorrows, for his outward life is apparently a happy. one. A lovely wife, interesting children, and a devoted flock. But the warfare, whatever it was, is past. He appears always cheerful, and sometimes mirthful. He has the most graceful and gentle humor; it becomes him well as a man and a Christian. Why should not a clergyman be play- ful? I love to hear him preach-I love better to hear him talk. I sent him some lines, which he acknowledged in a charming note. I was introduced at his house, to a Miss Pomfret, an intelligent, funny little person, who has a great fondness for cats. When I called to see her, I was introduced to a long- haired, white pussy, who had made her bed on the parlor lounge. That was Fairy. Dagon was summoned, but did not appear.

The presence of so many people, and the busy preparations going on around, confused and bewil- dered me. I really think my dear friends felt more than I did at the time, but you must remember, I had been thinking of the probable event a year or more, and had passed through many stages of feeling respecting it. Confess you were a little fearful that my constancy could not stand so protracted a test as a two years' engagement. Confess you were a little afraid I should wake up some morning to the conviction, that this was but one more of my passing fancies. You had heard me say so many times (I wonder I could ever have been so foolish as to speak out, whatever I might have thought,) "Ihavefound my ideal;" and in a little time, the illusion vanished, and the enchantment was broken, that you were every day expecting to receive the announcement that another bubble had burst, another dream of love ended. I can understand with what anxiety you awaited the arrival of my letters, expecting in each one to read the old story, "Romance dispelled; llusion gone," etc.; and when, after months of anxious suspense, you were summoned to attend my wedding, what a sense of relief you felt; and so did I, dear, I felt something of that peace for which I have always longed.

(Entre nous) my dear, I have no key, and the windows and doors of my heart are never shut; if I try to close them they don't fit tight, and so anybody can peep in. I shall set about repairs in earnest; I owe it to my husband to be less free with my other friends than I have been, for although I have no secrets of my own, I wish to be faithful to the trust he reposes in me. Besides he may like to feel he has the exclusive right to my confidence. I beseech you do not ask many questions- I might say something I ought not. Come and see whether I am happy or not, but believe this, if I were not so, i would not tell you, if I could help it. You would say, if you saw me, that if I am not happy it is my own fault. Everything that affection and kindness can do for me is mine. Ah yes! if I am not happy the fault is indeed in me. You know we begin the world with nothing but health, affection, and good prospects. The first and last may give out, but the other is a mine too rich ever to be exhausted. I never think whether we shall get along in- a worldly sense or not. I suppose we shall.

One of the dear friends of my youth lives there in opulence and splendor; our paths in life are widely separated now. I doubt if we renew the golden thread of our early friend- ship. In the world her position is widely different from mine; her friends, her associations, her outward sur- roundings, her habits, and pursuits all are different, and I feel with pain for my own sake, that we shall not meet as formerly; but my heart will ever retain sweet recollec- tions of a friendship that beautified many years of youth, and that hereafter, when nothing external stands between us, may add another to the enjoyments of a better world. I find much to amuse and interest me in this great city. I do not feel the need of society, for my time is wholly occupied. I have always thought it a wife's duty to assist her husband in his exertions for their mutual support, and am determined to do so, if circumstances ren- der it expedient. Some women have a gift of saving, and going without, and by the most rigid economy, and thrift, helping their husband's fortunes; but this gift is not mine. I have, however, a deal of energy, and a love of activity. I had rather work to earn than to save, although I can do without cheerfully, when I am com- pelled to. "Where there's a will, there's a way," as I can prove to you. We were sitting in our third-story room in a boarding- house in Leonard street-when the servant announced a gentleman down-stairs who wished to see me. On enter- ing the parlor, a stranger advanced, and introduced him- self as Mr. Briggs, publisher. He opened his business at once, saying he had been directed by Miss Grey (God bless her), to call on me, about a matter of writing. He   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 41 wished to get up a book for children, to be published in numbers. He had obtained plates from England, originally engraved for a work now out of print, and he desired to have short poems and stories adapted to the pictures, some of which he had with him and showed to me. He asked me if I would undertake it? I had learned enough of the ways of the world, to conceal the eagerness with which I contemplated his proposition, not only for the profit, but the pleasure of the undertaking. Putting on as important a bearing as I could assume, I questioned him respecting the compensation to be allowed. He asked what I should consider sufficient? Being profoundly ignorant, yet not wishing to appear so, I had foresight enough to reply, that I would take the matter into consideration, and in the meantime, I desired him to make me an offer for the work, which if I considered sufficient, I would accept and begin immediately. He took his leave and I flew, as fast as I was able, up three flights of stairs to our room, waving the pictures in triumph before my husband's face, and quite too much out of breath all at once to explain the errand of my mysterious visitor. We sat down, and looked at the prints together. "Can you do it," asked my husband?"Oh I can do anything," I replied, for I felt an energy and a joy in having an opportunity thus opened to me, that had it been a task a hundred times more difficult, I would have undertaken it with hearty good- will. "And what do you think it is worth," I asked? "I declare I dont know," said he. "We must consider awhile." After a good deal of debate we at length fixed upon a sum, that seemed sufficient compensation, but thought it wiser to ask our good friend Miss Grey's advice, before the matter were settled. The next day 4     42     THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, Mr. Briggs came for his answer. I inquired what terms he had to propose. Imagine my feelings when he men- tioned a sum just double the one we had agreed upon, as sufficient. I felt as if my fortune was made. My career as an author was begun; I saw the golden har- vest before me. I am ashamed almost to confess that my emotions were of a very mercenary character. The ambition to be an author, to write well, to earn a reputa- tion and deserve one, had little place in my mind at that moment. I thought only of the ability to help my hus- band, to relieve him of anxiety, to lighten his labors, and I was happy. Yes, dear--that moment I was happy; but then, as in all instances when my heart swells with real joy, it comes unsought-unexpectedly. I am now every day busy with my writing. I find the task more difficult than I supposed, but by no means irk- some. Circumstances render it necessary that I should prepare several numbers in advance, as we are to make some changes in our way of life soon. If I had more time, I should do the work better, but the publisher is satisfied, although I am not. I am getting to feel a little sensitive at the thought of giving my hasty and imperfect productions to the world, and wish I had a choice of subjects; but the end--that is the thing after all, that I contemplate with the most satisfaction. You remember my allusion in a former letter to my dear friend Grace Langdon! how enthusiastically 1 loved her! how beautiful and captivating I thought her! and you know also how affectionate and kind she was to me; what charming letters she wrote, and how gracefully she performed a thousand nameless acts of love, which bound my young heart closely to her in an almost passionate friendship?--And now, our homes are   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE.   43 in the same city-yet what different homes! I feel that we are more widely separated, though in the same town than years ago, when the ocean rolled between us. There's no use denying it, there is a gulf between the poor and the rich, if not spiritually, yet conventionally. They do not meet on equal grounds. Affection may be preserved amidst this inequality of station, but the pleasure of social intercourse, the satisfactions of friend- ship are painfully marred; our interests are no longer in common, we cannot mutually understand each other's lives. With us poor ones suspicion is apt to creep in, not always without foundation, but of a nature to destroy perfect freedom of intercourse. We are over-sensitive perhaps, and imagine slights where none were intended. We do not understand the difficulties of our friend's position, we only feel, that, somehow, their gain  in worldly ways, is our loss in the heart's goods; we meet infrequently, who were wont to meet daily. The intervals become- longer and  longer, until finally our visits almost cease. Whose fault is it? Our hearts yearn for the old companionship. We dwell on the past till we feel a burning sense of injustice at the change which has come over our mutual relations. Our pride aggravates the evil, and increases the distance between us. We rail against society-sneer at wealth-losing, while we do so, our genuine self-respect, although we seem to be establishing it on a firmer foundation than ever. There is no help for it; we are poor. We are in nowise distinguished, even as belonging to the class of intellectual poor. We  cannot impress our value upon anything or anybody. We will not be toadies; we hold ourselves too high for patronage. Our self-love is wounded, our heart aches also to be obliged to surrender $     "    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, a friend we have loved-but it is not our fault. We must get over it the best way we can. And we do get over it. Even I do, with all my tenacity. But it robs life of some of its rainbow hues after all. Let nobody say the change that difference of circumstances induces, owes its existence to the imagination only, or that it is the offspring of jealousy and suspicion. What the heart feels is often truer, and more real than what the head tries to reason about. Not the hardest part of the trial is the mockery of those who set it down to the low suggestions of mortified pride, and baseless suspicion. The fact is, and all the talk of all the wiseacres in Christendom cannot alter it, or take out the pang of wounded friend- ship. But if "things must be as they may," there's no use in grumbling at fate, or at friends. Thank God, 1 have the memory and the written-record of years of sweet communion, and unnumbered acts of kindness which time and change can never efface. Let me now describe my first dining out with my friend in her elegant home. What to wear was a question that did not require long deliberation, as my wardrobe, if it lacked variety, had the advantage, so lauded in works of art and taste, unity. My dress was one, and soon put on. I could have imagined many other dresses more becoming to my style of beauty, but perhaps none better suited to my circumstances. My husband was not going with me- it was a social day to which I was invited, and he was to come for me in the evening. I had learned how to use silver forks-thanks to the instructions of one member of our family, who not only had a taste for the elegancies of life but the means of gratifying it. Fortunately, this acquisition to my polite education was not to be made for the first time; but there was one dread which hung over me like a nightmare from the moment I realized   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE.  45 what it was to dine with people who lived in style, Finger-bowls-what they were-how large-what form- how and when required-I was profoundly ignorant; yet I had an intuitive conviction that, as cfinger-bows" were indispensable at fashionable tables, I must be pre- pared for the encounter with them. I knew I should not drink the contents, for I had read an account of an unlucky countryman who had been guilty of that mon- strous impropriety, in his ignorance of the use for which they were designed, but I did not know but I might be guilty of some other equally monstrous absurdity. "If I only knew how people used finger-bowls," said I to my husband, "I should go with a light heart to this dinner* As it is, they weigh upon my spirits like so much lead." "Do as you see others do," was the very sage counsel of my husband.  "But being company they will come to me first," I replied, and what shall I do to disguise my ignorance? Am I to take the bowl and put it beside my plate, or on my plate? Am I to dip the tips of my fingers in, as the servant holds it?" Alas! he could not enlighten me. I tried to get a little nap before I set out, to strengthen my nervous system for the occasion, but I saw in my disturbed visions nothing but finger-bowls. "I must meet them  as bravely as I can," said I; "the thing can't be got over now. How dearly do we buy experience in this world, and what a 'howwid-vulgar' thing it is to be poor!"I went. I sat with my friend in pleasant chat, an hour or two before din- ner. I really had quite forgotten the ordeal through which I was to pass, when the summons came that dinner was ready.  Then the terrible fact came over me with such a rush as almost to overwhelm me. The lady's hus- band was almost a stranger, and besides him, there was a young man, whom I had never met before, to witiess my     "    THE OLD OOBNE CUPBOARD; OR, awkwardness and ignorance. But it was too late to retreat. We walked through the hall to the dining-room; we entered the door. The first thing that caught my eye was a sideboard upon which was ranged a regiment of blue-glass bowls half-filled with water. I knew what they were as well as if they had been stamped, in letters of flame, finger-bowls. They did not look so very formida- ble. If one only could be genteel by instinct! I mentally ejaculated. How I wished that I felt at home, that I might just unburthen my heart and confide the whole of my stupid ignorance to my friend. But the truth was, I was anxious to appear to know all about it, and that was the source of my discomfort. I did not enjoy my dinner. The finger-bowls seemed to be grinning at me from their elevated position. What a contemptible thing poverty is! I exclaimed inwardly, cramping one in every way, and making one feel so ill at ease that even the very ser- vants chuckle at you in their sleeves! That great Irish- man, standing behind my lady's chair, knows that I never saw a finger-bowl before. I see it in his very smile, and he feels his own superiority. How I wished I was a man and wore a boot! As it was, I simpered, talked, and tried to appear "an fait" in everything. ' C' est le premier pas qui coute," said I to myself, I shall never be caught so again. I shall have learned one lesson after these protracted sufferings. I shall have passed one more barrier in the road to gen- tility. I wondered what Pelions and Ossas yet remained. But the result proved the truth of what has so often been repeated: "No evil is so terrible in reality as it is in ap- prehension." When the appointed hour came, the finger-bowls were placed beside each one. My apprehensions were thus removed: I leered out of a little corner of my eye, to see   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 47 how my friend managed, and did as nearly like her as I could. After it was over I should have been glad to begin my dinner over again and to have made a hearty meal. Everything was so nice and tempting as it took its flight; but I made up my losses at tea-time. What sport we had, my husband and I, as we walked along Broadway home! How we joked about finger-bowls! How good-natured and satisfied we were with ourselves, each other, and our homely surroundings! How we con- gratulated ourselves on our freedom! We would go where we pleased, eat our dinners with steel forks and without finger-bowls, and nobody be the wiser. Our dear little room, in the third story, never looked so bright as when the morning sun looked lovingly in the window, and hour after hour, we sat together talking, and planning, and contriving how we should make the two ends meet, and it did not trouble us to know that the pro, babilities were that we should neither of us, for many years to come, perhaps never in our lives, require the luxury of finger-bowls. ;Yt   -         * M   *  After this long silence, you may suppose I have much to communicate, that will be interesting to you. Let me open my budget, and you can decide for yourself of its importance. Yes; literally, I would open my budget, a little bundle of flannel, soft and fine. Turn down this corner that lies over my left arm, close to my heart-you stare! Why don't you say something?"What is it?" "Is this the question you ask? It is my baby--yes, mine. Take it in your kind arms; feel its soft breath on your cheek; look into its blue eyes, and don't ask me if I am happy now. Deep, deep within my heart is a joy which throbs with every pulse, and you may call it bliss. It is     48     TH1 OLD CORNER CUPBOABD; OB, bliss, such as I never even dreamed of till this new foun- tain of blessedness was unsealed within me. You had not heard of the advent of this young spirit before, because, while I was quietly staying at home, too happy to write, you were running hither and thither in search of pleasure in variety. I heard of you at Nia- gara, at Trenton, at Montreal, and Quebec, and I longed to learn of your return home, that I might tell you of the new treasure that had beenadded to my life. And it is three months since these blue eyes, that now smile upon me, opened upon this great round world. In the meantime, I have left the city, and am living in Linn- wood. I have brought my child to the home of his mother's childhood, where I too, in unconscious infancy, first learned to love a mother. How often I have thought of her since the birth of my child has given me this new revelation in lift-a mother's love. Can it be possible, that one human heart ever felt for me, what I now feel for this helpless little creature? And she died. Even a mother's love cannot triumph over the doom of mortality. She died, giving up all she held dear in life, without a murmur. Could I die thus peacefully if God should sum- mon me to leave this little one behind? Now I believe and feel for the first time, that there is no death to the affections, or God who made us is not a tender Father. A mother's love is immortal, and I am convinced that this new consciousness I feel, of my mother's spiritual presence, is a token that she is drawn nearer my heart by the bond of maternity. I go on with my writing, and my husband too is occu- pied, and we shall remain here during the summer. I have very little time for musing, although the old haunts invite me to wander as of yore, and dream amidst their *    *f    *    *    *   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 49 quiet beauty as I used to do. But I dream no longer. Life has become a reality to me, and reality satisfies me better than dreaming. Sometimes in my leisure moments, I take my little boy across the field, and sit down with him upon my knee, beside the old mill-stream. Old, I say; but no, that is as young as ever; that, and the sun* light can never grow old. It is I who am older than I was, when I used to wander along the green banks, and picture the time to come, yearning for something to fill my soul. I sit here now, with my blue-eyed boy in my lap, and while he watches the waves dancing onward and ever onward, I watch him alone. I see the sunshine and the shadows reflected in his eyes. I am afraid it is not wise. Do you think it is idolatry? I believe* I am glad that we are poor. I am convinced I should never know the value of life, if I had no need of exertion. I makes my husband and child dearer that I can give my strength and life in their behalf. --What I had no spirit to do for myself, it is sweet to do for them. And yet something whispers in my soul, it is selfishness to narrow myself within my own little home-circle. If it is, I shall live to do better. I wish I were not so anxious a mother. I feel it to be wrong. I lack something yet to establish within me that peace which I have always coveted. Do you know what it is? I will tell you. I lack the Christian's trust in God. The thought, that this little life may be snatched from me-the bare possibility of being so bereft, fills me with dread. I walked to the burying-ground yesterdays to visit the graves of those I have lost. Overgrown with moss and hardly discernible among the tangled weeds and briers, is the headstone that marks my mother's grave. So many, many years since she parted from us, her young children, from her faithful husband, from a happy home, 5     CO     TME OLD OBRNE CUPBOARD; OR, ftm the gladsome earth; and where is she now?' Is not the thought of death awful To part from those we love, to go away into darkness, it makes my heart faint. After wandering through the quiet paths some time, I came to a newly-erected monument, to the memory of a Polish exile, who came to Linnwood as a teacher, and died in a few months after his arrival. I remember well the evening he came to our door. He had a letter of in- troduction from a physician to my father. I opened the door as he rang. It was late twilight, and almost dark. A deformed little man stood before me. Such a face, such eyes, I never saw. There was a light in them that seemed unearthly; it was certainly unnatural. He deli- vered his letter, and remained awhile talking with father. We saw him often after that, and every day he seemed weaker and nearer his last hour; but he continued to teach, for he was penniless, and would not be dependent. The light in his eyes grew more and more intense, and his cheek paler and thinner. He was in every sense, a poet. A little work that he had written in his own language, had been translated by some American. It contained a history of the Revolu- tion in Poland, a few snatches of song, and a short story. Whether there was really any merit in them, or whether the sympathy his misfortunes inspired, prepared me to discover indications of genius in his productions, I cannot say. I felt an intense interest in him. He did not ap- pear to think his illness dangerous, and fully expected to recover. A pretty young girl, an orphan, whose heart was full of tenderness for the suffering everywhere, manifested the greatest sympathy for him, and inspired him with the most romantic passion. Her society beguiled many of his hours of weariness. He used to listen to her sweet songs, gaeug upon her with those strange bright eyes, from which   THE EVtRT-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE.  51 his very soul looked out. It made me sad to see them yet she made his life brighter. One day, he was missing from the school, where he had been faithful at his duties, in sunshine and storm. Days passed, and he did not ap- pear. We learned that hle was ill. Kind friends minis- tered to his necessities. The day before he died, he sent for our young friend to come and see him for the last time. She was advised not to go-people might talk. Her heart prompted her to go. She could not decide whether to obey her- heart or public opinion. While she was deliberating how to act, he died. Isn't it a hard world that thus fetters the impulses of a young, pure nature? Here he sleeps now, in peace. Some one has planted roses over his- grave. I enjoy my summer very much; my days are devoted to my writing and to the care of my little boy, but in the evening we meet our friends, hear good music, or take long walks. It is a beautiful thing to live! You have many times heard me speak of    one Of the friends of mynearly days. How disinterested, how devoted she is, living only to do good, and to make others happy. Alas I the fading roses on her cheek, and a gra- dual decline of physical strength and energy, warn us that she is " wearing awae' to the land o'- the leal." I walked with her yesterday-evening, and she told me-that she was persuaded she should live but two years. I tried to laugh her out of her presentiment. telling her I had no faith in anything of the kind; but she knows, she says, that she is slowly dying, and shall last about two years. She speaks of it with the greatest cheerfulness, and with- out the least dread. Yet how much she has to live for-- apparently. A  home of elegance and refinement; mother,     62     THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; ORB, brothers and sisters, by whom she is most tenderly beloved. How can she bear the thought of death? Home again in the city. Now here and now there, but everywhere at home, because I have always my loved ones with me: Times are hard, in a worldly point of view, and if it were not for health and hope, we should be poorly off. But it is only the actual inconveniences of small means that annoy us. The absence of luxury, the coldness of false friends, the slights, and the whole catalogue of vex- ations one meets in the world and in society, these all go by without leaving any wound except an occasional con- tusion to our pride and our self-love. These, everybody must expect in a large city, where so many are scrambling for the highest place. I cannot say but it was galling to my self-esteem, to be chalked out of the visiting list of one who, when I first came hither, was in a situation to understand fully the privations of poverty. But fortune having now placed my former friend on a higher plat- form, I find myself recognized as only an acquaintance. Then, too, it is vexatious to feel ones-self separated, cut off by conventionalities from intimate communion with a person really loved and valued, with whom are intimately associated many pleasant hours of youth. It is hard, in short, to be no longer necessary to one who once felt the need of our friendship. But I don't complain. It is one of the unavoidable results of the inequalities of society. By the way, the combination of words in this last sen- tence, suggests a topic which I wonder has not made the subject of my letters long ago. What an egotist I am, to fill these pages about myself and my little domestic affairs, in the midst of all this excitement about Reform, Fourierism-and the reorganization of Society! Do I not every Sunday go to the hall in a--y street, and   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE.   53 there listen to the most eloquent man of the age? And do I not come away every time convinced that Society is in a very bad state, and something must be done immediately to make it better? Are not my sympathies painfully excited, by tales of the misery of the poor, and do I not feel that their great wrongs cry out to -all reflecting people for redress? Have I not often left the presence of that inspired man, feeling, that henceforth no narrow, selfish aims shall find quarter in ny breast- resolved to live for my race--to work for " the brother. hood of man," and to follow the ranks of those who, wishing to begin a better order of things, intend to organize a community of interests, where equal rights and  privileges shall be secured to each? But after thinking  it over at home, my  enthusiasm  cools off. Present duties to those nearest to me, engross my time, and I decide that it is not for such as I, to be a pioneer in that reform.  There is a diversity of gifts, and mine are of a quiet, homely kind. I see that there are great evils in the world and in society, which must exist till people are Christianized. I  doubt if association and Fourierism will prove the sovereign remedy. Selfishness in some form or other, actuates many of those who come into the community, as well as those who stay out of it, like myself. All are not willing to work, and many are glad to adopt a way of life which they think will help them to live without any great personal exertion. The element of discord is in our own bosoms. It is the infernal fire of self-love which we all nurse up and try to disguise by different names. And although we cannot cheat others into the belief that our zeal is philanthropy, we can easily become dupes ourselves. Evil is in the heart of man, and will stay there until the human race is regenerated. I don't know how this agrees with your Doctrine; and per.     *54   THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, haps it sounds to you very like the old cry of Total De- pravity. "God made man upright," but that was a great while ago, and since then, he has " sought out many in- ventions." My creed would be a puzzle to theologians I imagine. It is simply this-God is infinite goodness, and wisdom, and love. He made man with capacities for the highest virtue and happiness, and placed him here in freedom. He fell, and must continue to fall into many errors and mistakes, because he is finite and imperfect. What is called the punishment of transgression, is the result of violation of laws, which, as they are perfectly adapted to promote man's highest good, cannot be vio- lated without suffering. This is retribution. Not arbi- trary, but inevitable as the law of cause and effect. This suffering is the check and restraint necessary to society and the individual. The origin of all good is God, the origin of all evil is with man. Whether the burthen is to be laid on one man or on the race, I leave to scholars to decide. The evil in the world grows out of a love of self in one form or another. The Lord came to teach love to God and the neighbor. When this is learned, we shall have no need to go into Association. The whole earth will be a com- munity of peace and good-will. We have made but slow progress in eighteen hundred years, but all great changes are slow, as our old parson W- used to say, and as the present state of civilization proves. The race, as well as the individual, must work out its own salvation. But if the principles of Love to God and the neighbor were vital in every heart, the Millennium would surely smile upon the world. Perhaps you don't believe in the Millennium. I do. Are you one of those who accept and reject, as your reason thinks best, the words of Holy Writ? or do you feel bound to receive all just as you find it in the letter? Or are you   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 5O timid about expressing your opinion since honest Judge H-- was branded an infidel for daring, in the face of a puritanical community, to avow that he did not believe an ark, of the dimensions given in the Bible, was capable of containing the immense family appointed to fill it? It went against common sense and sound philosophy. I have lately read a work on the "Internal Sense of the Word." I like it, and if-we may credit the authority of those who have made it a study, the Word of God, thus explained, forms a beautiful and consistent whole. I cannot, nor do I wish to divest my mind of that reve- rence for the Bible, with which my mother inspired me in my earliest childhood, when I was scarce able to read, and much less to understand its inspired words. The Psalms I committed to memory then are still fresh in my mind, and what was but a mere form at the time, has since been imbued with a soul. I believe that we should teach our children to reverence the Bible. The truths we impart to them from its pages are not dead, they will not die. The angels that watch over young children are always near when they read, or are taught from the word, and celestial love flows into their young hearts, which will vivify the seed thus implanted, and cause it to grow, and bear fruit in after years. The angels guard these truths and preserve them pure amid the temptations and allure- ments of the world, and they become the instruments of regeneration in mature life. Whether this be fancy or reality, it is a sweet belief, and as I have no head to reason, for which I am glad, I receive this doctrine into my heart, and as far as I am able, shall act upon it in my own spiritual education and that of my child This intellectual faith that some people require would not satisfy me. It is the heart that cries out for God- with my heart I believe in Him, but with my head I     56     THE OLD CORNEWI CUPBOARD; OR, doubt everything. I suppose my deficiency in what is called the reasoning faculty, or intellect, for which so many people run wild, and which, when they think they have found it, they bow down to and worship, accounts for the joy I feel in the contemplation of simple goodness. Whenever I find it, whether in learned or unlearned, rich or poor, high or low, it wins my highest reverence. Therefore I can love and respect common:place people, as they are called, and do not require that my friends should have great gifts and learning to satisfy my demands. Still the most gifted minds are really the most simple and true in the 'intercourse of daily life, for they are too much in earnest to think of the effect they produce. Pedantry and affectation are hateful to me. Goodness that flows forth in kind deeds and words, in warm sympathies and unselfish devotion to others, this brings down heaven to earth. I don't mean to disparage intellect, but give me the true, warm heart, rather than the keen sharp intel- lect, if I cannot have both; and as for the judgment, I would sooner trust the impulses of a good heart than the reasoning of a logical head. It is very natural that I should write so, having, as is well known to myself and my friends, no power of logic, no wit, no smartness whatever; and I ought not, I suppose, to have felt piqued when Miss Grey, who has been a little injured by flattery, pronounced me " a good sort of person, but very common- place." But we are often perfectly willing to depreciate ourselves, while we are vexed with others for doing it, perhaps on our authority. We are very pleasantly situated this winter, boarding with friends: intelligent, cultivated people. We ought to be happy in an atmosphere of poetry. Our eyes and souls have refreshment and variety, but the perplexities   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVEBY-DAY PEOPLE.  87 of life thicken, and a certain inward anxiety often closes the heart against mirth and enjoyment. Yet we are by no means -discouraged. One instance such as we met with the other day, of real generosity, disperses many a dark cloud of distrust. The rich are not always those most ready to assist, but there is one man here, living in luxury and elegance, who perhaps does not know and never may, the extent of the kindness he has rendered us. But I hope we shall all live long enough to be mutually understood; we to prove our gratitude and honesty, he to be convinced that we never can forget his kindness. Our boy grows in grace and in favor with his loving parents; but he is too fair, too frail, too like the early May buds, which a breath may destroy. His mind outgrows his tiny frame, and is too mature for his body. - If he had other playmates of his own age, it would be better for him. He is always with me, plying me with such strange questions and making such wise observations. I do not like to see such precocity, but how can I help it? When next summer comes, we will let him run wild in the coun- try, and associate with other children. I long to see him playing in the dirt, and I wish he were not so -good and so gentle. I almost wish I did not love him so well. Next summer, we shall go in the country again. I think care and anxiety are beginning to drag me down a little; perhaps it is because those feel it who are dear to me. We talk of changes-of going west; but how can I bear a separation from so many of my friends. Can I ever make new ones who will be half so dear? Fortunately we are placed in a condition at present, cheered by sympathy as well as congenial tastes and pursuits. We are all pretty much in the same worldly condition, requiring patience and hope for our constant attendants. Patience under present annoyances, and hope for better times. It is-true,     68    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, that "misery loves company," and only those in strait- ened circumstances, can understand the privations of po- verty. Sometimes I work myself up into quite a misan- thropic state of mind, and enjoy the luxury of hating the world for a while; the cold hard world, that does us so great injustice; but I cannot retain my grudge long. My world is not without, but close at hand, and why should I rail against outsiders Let them go their ways and I will go mine. A wedding-to me a sad one, for I can foresee no hap- piness in such a union. It may be under certain circum- stances, a fine thing to marry a poet, provided he is a genuine poet, and a good man. And then, if he must be poor, let the pair go off into the wilderness, and live on berries, and sing to the echoes. Don't let them at- tempt to live in the world, and in society. Let us have no aping of what worldlings do. Away with the super- fluity of houses with kitchens, where the wife must fry herself over the coals. It is not fair that the poetry of life should be all on one side. I am not angel enough to be willing to roast my mortal body over material fire to keep my husband's soul in a glow with the flame of genius. I could do it a little while, but I know I should have no heart for it long. Let those who marry genius in poverty, live on angels' food, or let them go off to the wilderness and live in a cave on' roots and herbs.' One can't enjoypoetry, or appreciate inspiration, when one's head aches and one's limbs are weary, and one's back is broken. I could not dream of nec- tar and ambrosia, when .my hands were in the wash-tub; nor could I bear to hear of Olympus and the gods, while I was on my knees, scrubbing a floor. Yet, if we live in society, all this must be done, by somebody, or else con-   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE.  59 fusion and dire disorder will drive one distracted; and if one is too poor to have it done, one must do it one's-self. But should I have patience to do it, day after day, and year after year? Illusion may last a little while, but reality will come in the end, and our poor poet's wife will not be content to be a household drudge. She will be very likely to say to her hero, '" descend from your Olympus, and cut down some of your trees to make the pot boil for dinner, and bring a bucket of water from your Hippo- crene, to wash the children's clothes, or the sooner we get out of this great working-day world the better." But our poet, what does he know whether the pot boils or not, or whether the children are clean or otherwise? What cares he for eating? Ah! he cares enough, silly woman that thou art. Your poets don't live on air; the divine spark would very soon go out, if thy kitchen-fire did not its duty. Poets must eat and drink like other men, and they are the harder to please, inasmuch as they cannot live on coarse fare like ordinary mortals, but must have something as near nectar and ambrosia as possible, which everybody knows is not to be obtained by the mere asking. To be sure, it is a sweet privilege in the abstract, to minister to these fine natures, but in reality, the every-day drudgery of life, to one not habitu- ated to it, and to one whose tastes and habits incline her, to pursuits more refined and intellectual, takes away the charm wherewith the sentiment of the thing idealized life. I cannot but feel sad at this wedding. Lizzie is a girl of a beautiful nature, but not in the least practical. She has no bodily strength for labor, and no faculty for living upon nothing. Although her father is not rich, his daughters have always lived in comparative ease and ele- gance. With the best intentions, and the most devoted     60     THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, love, I feel that she is unequal to the life she has assumed. It must end in disappointment to both. And then, I do not like the idea of Edward's thinking he can live by writing poetry. In our country it cannot be: and I think too, he would write better poetry, if he lived in the world, and mingled with his fellow-men. I like the fresh, living thought that has humanity in it. I like the genial sym- pathies that have real objects to bless; that go out amidst the dusty highways of actual life, and scatter roses along the beaten track. I have outgrown much of a certain sort of sentiment, and have learned to value the unwritten poetry which we meet often in the daily lives of those who never joined two lines together in rhyme, more than the inspirations of a genius that never went out of the narrow sphere of selfish interest. Edward may be a genius. He certainly has passed his life, thus much of it, amidst books, and with his own imaginations, but that does not fit him to appreciate the worth of a loving heart and a self-sacrificing devotion, half so much as to have lived with his fellows, would have done. His habits have made him selfish. His family, proud of what they considered his genius, has also done its share, and he will be very apt to forget, in the demand of Ris nature for sympathy, that those connected with him have also a similar necessity, although forsooth, they have not the gift of expressing it in verse. Lizzie, I know, has this want, and has always found it answered, as far as is pos- sible, by a devotedly affectionate family. However sweet it will be for her to give-and to a true woman, it is a holy privilege-yet there will be times, when her own heart will yearn to be understood, when the wants and weaknesses of her nature will cry out for sympathy, and she will feel lonely and sad. And if, added to this, she   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE.  61 is compelled to perform laborious duties, beyond her strength, and unsuited to her condition, can she be happy I I look at the facts of the case. If there were any reason- able ground to hope that the future would grow brighter, it might not be amiss that they should have a taste of the actual in life. But unless somebody leaves them a for- tune, of which there seems no probability, there will be a good deal of hard work to be done, and I fear she will be obliged to do it. However, this ends my croaking. It may be that this is the very discipline necessary for them both. You do not believe, perhaps, that every body must be born anew-born from above, through trial and conflict, before the kingdom of heaven is formed within -the soul. I am not beginning a theological discussion however. We will begin that at a more favorable moment. Lizzie and Edward have my best wishes, and their happiness, as well as ours, is in God's keeping. Perhaps she will make him less selfish and exacting; and her love for him may make her more active and industrious. But I very much fear there will be but little poetry in their actual life. How refreshing it is, to leave the "deavin, dusty town," and breathe the fresh mountain air once more! How it gladdens my heart to see my boy happy, amid green fields and flowers! I wish you could see him at this moment- his straw hat wreathed with the bright golden coreopsis and crimson poppy-childlike, choosing the gayest and gaudiest flowers to decorate himself with. I cannot tell you the swelling of the heart I feel sometimes, as I watch him at play, or fold him in my arms. I do not think we can love these little lambs too well, but we may love un- wisely. I know not where or how the strength would come, to bear his loss, for the very contemplation of the     62     THE OLD COBNEE CUPBOARD; OR, possibility of it, overwhelms me. But why should I think of it  It is by asking and appropriating wisely and thankfully our daily bread, that we are strengthened and nourished, spiritually, as well as physically. We cannot lay up for future emergency of this manna from God. If every day I remember, with a grateful heart, Him to whom I owe this treasure, and the capacity to feel such blessed- ness in its possession, day by day, and hour by hour, cherishing it as a sacred trust, to train for an eternity of happiness and virtue, can I love it too well? Oh I the strength of this natural yearning! This it is, that I need to restrain. This it is, that makes me forget the higher love, that asks only the best good of its object, whether here or there, as God wills. Mrs. Derby is here, delighting us again with her inim- itable readings from Shakspeare. What a privilege to be allowed to hear her! What a higher appreciation one has of these plays, through her magnificent render- ing! I never saw a person who impressed me more with the power of genius than she. I suppose the homage she receives is gratifying to her, but it does not make her happy. I look with sadness on these beloved hills, where I have passed many happy hours, for I feel the uncertainty of the future, as I am about passing into new and untried scenes. In a few weeks I shall bid adieu to New England-to the friends of my youth-to old and hallowed associations, and begin a new life at the West. My husband has already been several months in our new home, and gives me glowing accounts of it and of the people. Mary Truman is to go with me. She, of course, is quite curi- ous to see the New World. Not that she expects to like it. She is, by far, too strongly wedded to New England, and to that particular part of it where she was born and   THE EVESY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE.  63 brought up, to prefer any other place; for a Boston woman is the quintessence of New England bottled up and hermetically sealed. I think it will do Mary good to extend the horizon of her sympathies. Wealth appa- rently is anything but a blessing to her, and indeed to any of her family. It is sad to see one in the very matu- rity of womanhood, who, to outward appearance, has everything to make life rich in blessings, so weary of it, seeking in constant excitement what is to be found only within. She does not value money for its own sake, but she seems to want some definite purpose, to which her abundant means and advantages can be applied. She has surrounded herself with elegance and luxury. Her own room is a perfect gallery of art, and she has all her time at her own disposal. She has decidedly a literary taste, and has written some poetry that well deserves the name, but there is no youth, no hope in her lay. The great want in her writings, as in her conversation, and even in her habits of thought, is simplicity and natu- ralness. She is stilted and artificial. Her religion par- takes of the same character. It is a sort of mystified sentimentality. It is her desire to be thought intellec- tual, and the sublimated atmosphere with which she sur- rounds herself, is not suited to the emergencies of daily life, I believe she has more heart than she gives herself credit for. I wish she would not stifle its natural work- ings. She has too little of the woman in her, to inspire affection, I fear, and yet sometimes she completely fas- cinates me by her tenderness of manner. I have had many minds about her, and now I dare not trust myself to give an opinion. She certainly must possess sterling goodness, or her friends would not love her so much. She is very handsome and attractive, but she expects so much that, I venture to predict, she will never find- her I     "    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, "psychological complement," to use her own expression.  Her frankness pleases me sometimes, but even that, has ceased to be spontaneous and natural, and it is so evident that she prides herself upon uttering her bold thoughts, in defiance of the opinions and feelings of others, that her truth has lost the charm it once had, and, in my judg- ment, is less the truth than when spoken, as it used to be, in apparent unconsciousness. She is what would be called an admirable talker, and is perfectly conscious of her power. She has great command of language, and has cultivated her gift to the utmost; but the brilliancy of her wit wearies one after a while, and one cannot help wishing she would get down from her stilts, and tread the earth as if she belonged to it. I confess I was once completely fascinated by her power of language, joined to so much enthusiasm and earnestness in her utterance of what she believed to be high truths; but the light that dazzles, is not the heat that warms. After I left her I found myself no wiser. I had a confused idea that I had been listening to very fine thoughts, but when I attempted to review them, their forms were so vague and imperfect, I could not recall them; and as for the rich drapery in which they were clothed, I could as soon have brought down the shifting clouds with their varied hues and shapes to earth, as to have seized upon those airy noth- ings that, floating high up in her intellectual heaven, seem substantial and beautiful, but vanish when the mind attempts to grasp them. This gift of tongues is very beguiling. It is an art that may be learned by study and practice, if one have the command of words; but it is often very superficial and deceptive, and nothing is so wearisome for every-day life. Mary thinks she is the very child of nature, while all    THE VERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE.  6  around her, are slaves to conventionality and custom. She thinks because she has picked up from books, and from the society of cultivated minds a certain freedom of  thought, with regard to the great questions of life, that she is in fact a sort of priestess, in her way, of a new era. She talks much of association, but is the last person in the world to give up her personal ease and comfort, or, to share the labor of life, where there must be an equal di- vision of work and remuneration. She will not even lift her little finger in the daily arrangement of her own room, nor put a needle to her own clothes. She talks eloquently of thc inequalities in society, but she would talk more feelingly, if she were to wake some morning to find her servants and waiting-women too much engrossed with the culture of their intellect, to perform their morn- ing duties. It is almost, nay, it is quite ludicrous to hear her rail against the artificial wants of society, and then follow her one day. Not that she has not truth on her side, but the truth that shines forth in life, is that which has power to arrest the busy world. If she knows so much better than the rest of us, we look to see her do better. Alas! we all know better than we do, and this should make us modest and humble. We look for results from these eloquent expounders of higher truth in a self- sacrificing life. Sometimes we find it, and it is a reproach to us, but when there is only a symmetric form of beauty without the soul, we become weary of having it continu- ally held up to us. You recollect the story we read to- gether not long since, entitled the "Fool of the nineteenth century," translated from the German of Zschokke. There was a man who had the strength and courage to live what he believed to be the truth, and all the world pronounced him a madman. What of all this, do you ask, and what has all this tirade to do with Mary? Mary stands in my 6      "    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, mind now, as the type of a class of people, who talk a great deal about a high ideal, an elevated state of society, and the advantages of culture, etc., etc., but lead perfectly selfish lives. Her cousin Ellen, is a girl of a totally dif- ferent stamp. A simple, retiring, womanly woman; plain in externals, unpretending in every way, thoroughly edu- cated, but without pedantry, who, convinced that there is much that is false and unsound in society, quietly adopts a life in accordance with her principles, has independence enough to live and dress simply, in a circle of fashionable friends; and although her income is liberal, voluntarily relinquishes much that would gratify her taste and intel- lect, that she may have the means of helping those whose condition needs help, and to whom high-flown sentiment is a bitter mockery. I do not take these two characters by way of strong mental contrast, for both are equally suited to adorn society by their talent and culture; but the one leads a true life and the other only talks of what constitutes one. Which does the most good  You seem rather inclined to reprove me for what I say about Mary Truman, but you do me injustice. I write, it is true, exactly what I think; at the same time, I believe she may, and possibly will, develop a higher character and a deeper conviction of the great purposes of life. If she were to marry, provided she married for love, and if she were to have a family of children, it would make her what she is capable of being-a noble woman. So too, if in the changes of life, she were to meet with reverses which called out her energies, she would show that she had an interior conviction that " life is real, life is earn- est," and most of all, if this intellectual variety, and this religion of sentiment should give place to the child- like faith and confiding love of the heart for its Creator   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE.  67 and Father, if sorrow or affliction, or the thirst of the soul for a higher good than is to be found in an external faith, should send her to the fountain of living water; if, in shdrt, she were to receive the kingdom of God as a little child into her heart, it would make her all that anybody could desire. We must all come down from what our friend G--- calls "the pride of self-intelligence," before we can receive the true light into our souls. When I have been here longer, I will tell you what you so much wish to know-how I like my present home. One's impressions of a new place, are vague and shadowy. I feel an unnatural excitement, which bewilders my judg- ment. I may say that I am disappointed in the place itself. I thought to find it more beautiful. I thought it was clean and fresh-half city-half country. But I find myself wholly mistaken. So far too, from looking new, as I had imagined-the houses are dingy, owing, I sup- pose, to the use of the bituminous coal, which creates so much smoke and soot. But the place is of little account comparatively. After we have left the home of our child- hood and youth, than which no other spot is so full of en- chantment, we have an unsettled feeling everywhere, as if we were indeed "pilgrims and sojourners on the earth." We may be contented elsewhere, but the heart turns back to its early love, with a longing that cannot be xttered, Then comes sober reason, to tell us that the home of our youth is not, and can never be again. It is, with our youth, vanished like a dream. We can return again to neither. Though our feet tread the familiar paths, though our eyes behold again the beloved objects, "Turn wheresooeer we may, By night or day, The things which we have seen, we now can see no more.,"     68     THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, But I do not speak this wholly with sadness. Life is richer to me now, than it was years ago. It was, to adopt again the words of my favorite poet, it was a life full of "Obstinate questionings Of sense and outward things, Fallings from us, vanishings, Blank misgivings of a creature Moving about in worlds not realized." It was a yearning, an anticipation glorious with the light of hope upon it, but that has passed. As I do not quote poetry in my letters often, I think you will pardon me when I am betrayed into doing it by old reminiscences with which you are intimately asso- ciated. One word about the people. I find them, in every way, kind and hospitable; but I have a source of internal anxiety, in the illness of my little boy, which prevents my receiving and reciprocating, as I could wish to do, the hospitalities of my new friends. The brightest ray of my earthly life is quenched, and, to my sick soul, all is darkness. I have lived to taste the extremes of joy and sorrow; to welcome a heaven- sent messenger of love, "trailing clouds of glory as he came," and to see him depart, and the darkness of the grave close behind him, and shut him from my sight for- ever. All the words of comfort that can be uttered by sympathizing friends here and from home, I have listened to, and thanked, from my heart, those who felt for my grief; but the load is not lightened. Will it ever be? I do not shut myself out from society. It is harder to do it in a new place, and among strangers, than it would be at home. I drag myself from place to place, not as a relief from sorrow, for I feel tie greatest relief would be to be left alone; but I go, because I am expected to go, because   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 69 I am a stranger, who has to make her home in the hearts of the people. I know that those who have never lost a child, particularly those who never have had one, cannot, in the least, comprehend how such a bereavement should so overwhelm me. I could not have understood it years ago. I must not expect others to comprehend it. There- fore, I go from house to house, as I am invited by new acquaintances; I greet smiling faces, cheerful hearts; I see joyous children; I listen to music and mirth, and try to keep down my tears; to behappy in their happiness, and to forget that my heart and my home are now so desolate. Not desolate. I was wrong to say so. How selfish grief makes me! Not desolate-young eyes full of innocent joy look up, with strange surprise at my tear, The silent reproach sinks into my soul, and yet I weep on. I walk the streets so strange, so unfamiliar; and my eye follows every boy I meet, to try and find some life-like resemblance to him whom, I know in my daily paths, I shall meet no more. Grief goes before me, as I walk on, and on; and when I return, grief meets me at the open door, instead of the blue eyes that used to welcome my return. But I must bear it. How, God knows! I know I must live; I know how much I have to live for. By-and-by, perhaps, I shall feel it, and find strength. I am sorry to go among my new friends so like a dark shadow. The very fact that I am among strangers makes me the more sad-but I will not write. When summer opens, we shall move to the country. I long for its quiet and repose. Fortunately I shall not have leisure to sit and think. "Time brings such won-  drous healing." I may yet write to you a cheerful letter, but have patience with me. *    *    *    *         70      THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OB, It is long since I have sent you any poems of my own, for the reason that I seldom  write any.   I write nothing, not even letters.  When I work, my thoughts are diverted into other channels; when I sit down to write, they all crowd back upon my heart. I send you these lines, be- cause they will reveal to you as much as I could tell you of myself. I lead a quiet life, and it fsbest suited to me for the present. Leave me, for I would be alone; Yet, least alone, when all are fled, For nearest then, the loved ones come, Whom we are wont to call, the dead 1 But closer do our thoughts entwine, When their freed spirits meet with mine. Nor prize I living friends the less, Who give to life its holiest light; Their cheerful tones, their cheering smiles, Their eyes with fond affection bright. Though eyes so bright, and forms so dear Have vanished from my pathway here. When aches the void within my soul, And 'mid the gay and noisy crowd, My heart grows sick with bitter thoughts Of ghastly death and chilly shroud; And those I love, seem lost for aye- Leave me alone with God, to pray. It smooths the troubled waves of grief, In quiet thought to sit awhile, While one by one, the lost return, And warm me with their heavenly smile. It is no dream- how well I feel Their sacred influence round me steal. The autumn winds are sighing now; The yellow leaves are thickly strewn- Decay and death in all I see, Recall the hopes forever flown. The autumn win4- the leafless bough, Hath mournful meaning to me now.   THE EVEBI-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE.     71 But leave me, gentle friends, awhile, That I may ease my grief by tears; For still before me shines a light To guide and bless my coming years; A calmer, steadier, holier ray, Than dawned upon my life's young day. And by its light, so pure and clear, My spirit feebly strives to see Beyond the mists of selfish tears; Beyond death's gloomy mystery; And as alone, I strive and pray, I see the earth-clouds pass away. Then drinks my soul, so parched and dry, Of living streams that cannot fail, And faith awakes to newer life, And looks beyond the fleshy vail; And even the murkiest clouds of care, The hues of heavenly patience wear. I am grieved at what you write to me, of Lizzie. It would be absurd in me to say to any one else, I predicted it, but you know I did so before they were married. Nevertheless, I am just as sorry as if the failure of their schemes had taken me by surprise.   There seemed so un- substantial a foundation for their domestic happiness! What will they do? Lizzie's health failing-a little baby- that of itself, must occupy her time, and be an unceasing drag upon her feeble health-what will they do?   I have looked over the volume of Edward's poems that you sent me. Don't ask me what I think of them. They want, what he seems to me to want--human nature and human sym- pathy. If mountains and rivers, sunshine and flowers are so much more to him than the holy ties that bind the race in gentleness together, it is a great pity he did not content himself with them, and not adopt the semblance of higher things for selfish ends. I could not criticise his poems, I leave that for reviewers. To me, they are but words /     72    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, strung together, harmoniously enough, but without soul. I confess, however, that I am old-fashioned in my taste, and cling to the simplicity with which, it seems to me, true inspiration always expresses itself. But if we live long enough, we shall yet see this artificial dress of thought pass away, and the poet will sing because he must, and his soul will speak through his words to the great soul of hu- manity. Edward's style of writing seems an imitation, an effort, a straining after startling effects, yet I may be too much behind the age to venture an opinion. And is it to this end, that he proposes to devote his life and the lives of his wife and children? Does it belong to the poet soul- warmed by the god-spark to intenser love and sublimer thought-to pass his days in indolent musing, while his wife is obliged to bear the burthen and heat of the day, working beyond her strength, and with a heart weighed down with anxieties? Let him exercise his poetic art, in painting to the life the lot of such a woman, if he has heart enough to appreciate it, and then let him contem- plate the picture, till it inspire him with better aims. Let him beautifully inweave his poet-fancies among the stern realities of daily life. I have little patience with him and I will not desecrate the name of poet by coupling it with his. Let him make his daily life poetry. What better material can he have, than those sweet affections which hallow his home. A young, trusting wife-a help- less child-self-sacrificing devotion. Let him take up these themes, and see how much he knows about them, and let him carry the sphere of human love with him to the mountains and valleys whose beauties he can depict with so many fine words and phrases, and I shall like his verses much better. I anticipate a question, you are dying to ask me, at this moment. You may forget it before you write again. Do Ifind so much poetry in the   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 73 actual? In narrow means-in the necessity of physical exertion-in daily anxieties-in the common-places of daily life-irritability-bodily infirmity, etc., etc.? It is a just question, but one not easy to answer. It is too much my habit to create an ideal world, in compari- son with which, the actual is poor and unsatisfactory; and before I had gained wisdom by experience, it was my wont to withdraw from the annoyances of the actual, and take refuge in this little world of my own creation, for solace and relief. I think I have discerned a "more excellent way" than this--one hard to walk in at all times-one often made difficult by the obstructions of selfishness, and often clouded by a want of faith. The path in which we walk, is God-appointed, although, to appearance, we seem to be often the sport of circum- stances. But I believe we may walk in cheerfulness and hope, through the devious windings of earthly life, when we admit this conviction to our souls-that we are in the sphere best suited to us, if we choose so to consider it. What right have I to withdraw intethe regions of higher and purer thought alone, when the lives of others are sa closely interwoven with my own, that all our joys should be in common? Let me rather bring from that purer realm of thought, something to beautify and enrich the path we are treading together. Let me strive to be more and more human. Let every pulse of happiness enlarge the sphere of my sympathies. I once felt-I think I told you at the time, and the memory of the feeling deepens constantly-.I once felt, when a new source of happiness was opened in my soul, and the throbbings of maternal love, for the first time, revealed to me my relations to the God and Father of all, that my heart had grown so large as to embrace all in its love, to whom the good Father 7     74     THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; ORB had given this capacity for happiness. I felt that I stood in new and high relations to every mother in the world, and to the very angels in heaven. It was a deep, solemn joy. Then again-and I think I tried to tell you, at the time, what the feeling was-the current of my life was again stirred, but not as before, with happiness. My heart beat to other music-each throb was as a knell to my buried hopes. But then, as before, my heart went abroad among my kind, searching for the stricken ones who could understand my sorrow. I found them every- where. Among the high and low-the rich-the poor- everywhere, I found hearts that had ached with anguish like mine, and the bond of sympathy which united me to my kind, was strengthened by mutual suffering. I felt the truth of these words, "He fashioneth our hearts alike." The differences which divide us are external. The life which flows into us, from the Source of life, is the same. A mother's love is the same in the high-born and the lowly-and grief is a universal leveler. This widening and deepening of our sympathies, is the secret of true, heart-felt happiness. And if those natures who are gifted above their fellows, with high thoughts and aspirations-felt more deeply this common bond- and believed that that life alone is truly rich which seeks to enrich others, we should have fewer examples like our , friend, of those who are of no use to themselves, or any one else.     *    *    *    Yk     s Mary Truman is in town now; I see her occasionally. Her transcendentalism creates a sphere about her, which frightens away many of our unpretending people. I am sorry, because I fear they do not give her credit for what she deserves. She is invited to all the social gatherings,   THE EVE Y-DAY LPU  OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 7 but is looked upon as a very literary person-quite a lion in her way. The ladies seem a little timorous of ap- proaching her nearly; but she has, manifestly, a prefer- ence to gentlemen's society. It often amuses me to hear her talk. It is her delight to combat always, the com- monly received opinions and practices of society. She does it as a sort of habit; and to show her own talent al argument. She starts with the axiom, that everything that is-is wrong. Society is all wrong-the church is all wrong-religion as it is, is a sham-marriage is a popu- lar fallacy-the Bible a tissue of inconsistencies and con- tradictions-and people, in general, mere bundles of affec- tation and absurdity. She is so handsome and so brilliant that she has numerous admirers; and among them, I think, is one who would be a lover, if she would permit him. The most amusing feature in their acquaintance, is the total contrast they seem to be to each other. It is a rich treat to hear them argue, particularly, as they can get very warm without losing temper. Mr. Herbert is simple, earn- est, unaffected and plain-spoken; clear-headed and practi-  cal. Mary, you know, is high-flown-mystical-wholly  ideal and speculative-and often exceedingly obscure. It would amuse you to hear Mr. H --- bring her down from her empyrean flights, in order, as he says, that she may adapt herself to his matter-of-fact comprehension. What- ever topic they begin upon, they always end in a religious iscussion. After an animated dispute of some length, at our house the other evening, they appealed to me, to lecide whose belief was the most rational. I, you know, ould never argue, and avoid an encounter of the kind Ls I would the attack of a wild beast of the desert. The lource of all my religious faith can be traced to the want )f my heart of a God. My head grows dizzy in specu- ation. When I would reason about the existence and     '76 .   TrB OLD COREM CUPBOARD; OR, the nature of God, he vanishes, or, at best, becomes an abstraction. My heart is not satisfied with the God of the philosophers. It asks for infinite- love and infinite wisdom in a Being whom I can call My Father, and to- wards whom throughout eternity, my soul must be drawn in nearer communion. In those moments of joy, which find no language, those aspirations that cannot be uttered, I should feel painfully how imperfect life was, unless I was conscious of a Being who, having created me, knows my inmost thoughts and emotions, and not only that, but being infinite in love as well as in knowledge, cares for my happiness and for the happiness of all the crea- tures whom his love created. So, too, in those hours of sorrow and anguish, when the trials of life press heavily upon the heart, and the hopes that have shed sunshine over our path, suddenly vanish in dark and cold eclipse; in hours of temptation and inward conflict, when waves of remorse sweep over the soul, and there is no human ear to whom we dare utter, even if we had the power to do so, what is passing within us, what but the thought of a li/ing, pitying God can impart health and peace? Tell rme that I limit God by bringing him down to the level of my own conceptions-by ascribing to him human attributes. It may be so, but as long as he has created me a finite being, I must accept the limita- tions of mortality, and do the best I can with the material given me. I do not see as I should gain anything by adopting Mary's vague abstractions, or by trying to com- prehend the incomprehensible.

" Pity it is that this faith should be lost amidst the wrecks of our early -hopes and joys. The intellect may take a bolder flight, and be lost. in the vast realms of specula- tion, calling it freedom; but there comes a time sooner or later, when weary with its wanderings, unsatisfied with life and with itself, after repeated disappointment has stifled even the longing for any earthly good, the soul re- turns like the wearied dove to the ark, and feels the truth of the blessed words of Him who knew the wants of our natures: "Except ye receive the kingdom of Heaven as a little child, ye cannot enter therein." But -we must not expect this knowledge will come alike to all. We do not know what preparation each one needs. It may be joy, it may be sorrow--God knows best. Mr. Herbert and Mary are on the porch in earnest talk as usual. What will this growing intimacy lead to? It is very evident that he feels a peculiar interest in her, but her feelings are not so perceptible. I told her the other day, if she were to wake up some morning and find herself poor, it would be the best thing that could happen to her. She would thus be compelled to exert herself, and I fear she will never do it unless compelled. She bears much plain speaking from me and loves me in spite of it. I  am becoming more and  more attached to her. Mr. Herbert asked her the other day, "For what end she studied? Why she forever buried herself in books? Why she pored over German and  French literature?"He declared her artistic education had made her so hypercritical, that she only looked at every object to find out its blemishes and defects, and that for his part he wondered that her friends dared to submit themselves to- her scrutiny. Her life, he added, was quite incom- prehensible to him.     78  -   THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, "She did not wonder that, with his ideas of what woman ought to be, it was so," she replied; "but she begged to differ from him." "Might he trouble her to define his ideas of what woman ought to be?" he asked. "It is evident," she replied, " your taste is for the help- less, clinging sort, with just intellect enough to keep the house in order, and get their husband's slippers ready for him; gentle, docile creatures, willing to concede to their husbands the exquisite delight of poking the fire, and scrupulously avoiding to meddle with it, until he returns home to stretch himself on two chairs, and doze over the newspapers till bed-time.

Meek, domestic stayers at home, that the house may be always in perfect order; readers of cookery books, and works on self-discipline. I think I see the sort of woman you would choose for a wife." "Where?" asked Mr. Herbert, good-naturedly. "In my mind's eye, Horatio," replied Mary Truman. "I wish you would call her from her uncomfortable retreat, as quick as possible," said he, "for the woman of my choice cannot flourish long in such quarters." "What do you mean?" asked Mary. "I was speaking figuratively," replied Mr. Herbert, "as you were, doubtless. That mind's eye of yours must possess great power of expansion?" "Not to contain the woman of your choice," replied Mary, sarcastically. "Yes, along with so much else. For if I am not mis- taken, it takes a very wide sweep, and embraces a vast multitude of people."   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE.  T9 "That may be, and yet room enough remain for your wife, as she presents herself to my comprehension. Such women require but a very small sphere-a little nook- in fact, the smallest space imaginable." "Like the angels who could dance on the point of a needle?" added Mr. Herbert. "Yes, it would take several to make one real woman," replied Mary. "Well, since you know her so well, it is cruel to with- hold her image from me. If I were a younger man, I might prate more of magnetic attraction, and hope to find her without help; but the time is past, in which I could rationally expect to fall in love at first sight." "If I cannot show you the one, I can point you to dozens of a similar character, if character can be predi- cated of that particular genus. The wife of Mr. Smith, or Mr. Brown, or any other man, who marries one of your very proper women-your pattern wives--will serve to illustrate my position. You can see them every day l" "But that is a poor satisfaction," said Herbert, "since the wife of Mr. Smith and Mr. Brown, can be nothing, in particular, to me." "But there are plenty of other women run in the same mould. I don't consider it of the least conse- quence, which you take. You can shut your eyes and pick, or draw lots-only she must not be past a certain age--she must be pliable, docile-plastic beneath your influence, just as Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Brown were." "Suppose I were to confess I did not like very young ladies. Will you use that very keen and comprehensive organ of vision, in my behalf, to find a woman you really thought suited to me?" "I don't think I could make the effort," said -Mary,     80    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, languidly, "it would involve too much study and re- search." "But you like study and research," added Herbert. "Ofa certain kind; in books, for instance," replied Mary. "Consider me a book then, I entreat you, and peruse me attentively?" "I prefer the study of the languages." "You had better go to the foundation of all language-- the demands of the soul for sympathy?" "I prefer works of 'art." "Am I not a good model?" "I have a decided love of the antique." "Then I am sure I am worthy your inspection, being ancient enough?" "But I like best to study the works of the old masters." ' Am I not the work of the oldest of all masters?" "You are an egotist, and I can't encourage egotists," said Mary. "People don't interest me; I don't like people. Give me nature; nature with which I can com- mune in silence; nature that does not bore me with words, words, words," and Mary walked away, with such an air, down the Sycamore path! I am half inclined to think she expected Mr. Herbert would follow, but he didn't. After waiting some minutes to see what turn matters would take, whether Mary would return, or Herbert turn down the path after her, I went out into the porch, and found the gentleman sitting in the self-same spot where Mary left him, and looking, for him, rather lack-a-daisical. I never could play a part in my life, so I told him I had heard his conversation with my friend, and according to my poor judgment, they had not made much progress in their friendship of late, notwithstanding the hour, and the place, and the scene, seemed suited to awaken very kindly and pleasing emotions.   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 81 Mr. Herbert looked grave; and I fancied I heard some- thing very like a sigh. "You find Mary a strange sort of being?"I added, "but I really believe all her queer ways of talking, in fact, many of her habits of thought are external. They don't, as you say, 'reach the interiors.' I used to feel that I never could love her; but she does, sometimes, give indications of a true womanly heart." "I wish I could discover any such indications," replied Mr. Herbert, in a dry, and I thought, rather bitter manner. "1 thought with you, at first, that the kernel was sound, if one could only get at it; but I doubt whether it is worth the toil and patience. These notions of hers seem to have taken root deeper than I at first believed. She could never be happy in domestic life." "Don't judge too harshy, my good friend," said I. "I have known Mary for years, and I have come to find more in her to love, as I know her more." "Do you really think she has a heart?" asked Mr. Herbert. "I really do," I replied. "And that it is worth the seeking?" he added with earnestness. "I do," I replied, half frightened; for I felt that he was very much in earnest-but I told the truth. "I wish that I could believe it," said he, grasping my hand. "She interests me more than any woman I ever met; and yet, I cannot approve of her. I have no sym- pathy with her feelings or her opinions. They do not accord with my views of woman. I have tried to think with you, that they do not belong to her; that they are the result of a false education; that she has a loving, tender, womanly nature. Her eye indicates it; her smile too, so full of sweetness, the tones of her voice, so fem-     82     THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, inine and musical. Her beauty has taken my senses cap- tive, but it shall not master my judgment. I could not love a woman who, at heart, cherished the sentiments I have heard her utter-on the highest and holiest themes. A woman's nature must be religious to be truly womanly, must recognize a fatherly God, must feel a childlike de- pendence. All the sweet and feminine affections tend to that; the very longing of her heart for sympathy, un- seals the fountain of religious joy to her. This is her strength--that she dwells nearest the great Source of all love; that from Him, flows into her soul that beatitude of affection which man's sterner nature cannot know. The wife, the mother, whose very sphere is love--do you think she would feel the sacredness of those rela- tions 2" Unfortunately, my good memory brought to mind a conversation with Mary, on the subject of marriage, in which she had brought up some of George Sands' ideas, and I could not answer immediately. "I see you cannot confirm my hopes," said Mr. Her- bert sadly. "What a pity! what a sad pity it is, that one so lovely in person, so fitted to inspire love, should not be the one to retain it! Nature, nay, let me not say nature-God gave her the capacity to become a perfect woman. How has a false system of education perverted or destroyed it!" L"You take the matter too seriously," said I. "When have you ever rationally undertaken to talk with Mary? I am sure your conversation this evening was badinage and joking merely. What would you have her do if you adopt a light, frivolous manner, but carry on the game  For my part, I thought you were chatting as idly, and I may say as foolishy, as two great grown-up children. I should never have dreamed of any serious intention at   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 83 the bottom of all that nonsense. Indeed,' I think you jumpat conclusions too hastily. Besides, many young women have foolish and false ideas before they are in love, which vanish, and give place to something much higher and purer when their hearts are really touched. And many women too--(perhaps I ought not to confess it, but it is true,) many women, who are full of tender, womanly feeling, have a sort of false shame about it, and assume sometimes a hard, cold, and sometimes perhaps, a light and frivolous outside, to conceal from common eyes, what they deem too sacred for common observers. I have known many of that description; some, who from early disappointment, or blight fallen upon their young affections, withdrew into themselves, thinking by a cold exterior, to hide their heart-sorrows from the world. Others, from a peculiar self-consciousness, and dislike of the scrutiny of people in general, adopt a careless and light way of speech and action, to mislead those whom they feel may misunderstand them." "And to which class, think you, may your friend be- long?" asked Mr. Herbert. "To neither wholly, and to both in part, perhaps," I replied. "Has she ever had a heart-sorrow " asked Mr. Her- bert with earnestness. "I can only tell what I have heard," I replied, " for Mary never confided her past life to me. I was told by one who knew her years ago, that she was once deeply interested in a man of great intellect, but whose heart was smothered by ambition. She was dazzled by his genius, and proud of his friendship-gave herself up to ,the fascination of his society, until she found herself enslaved by it; He married another, and since then, she sneers at love, and :turns sentiment into a joke. But I do not think she ever     n iULUI CORNER OUPBOARD; OR, really loved.' You look at me as if you expected I should say more, but I shall not. If a woman's heart is worth having, it is worth taking some pains for. The field is your own. I don't know as you have any rival." "But you can advise me?" "No, I can do no such thing. I don't know what would make you happy-you are the best judge of that. I cannot look with your eyes, nor you with mine. These matters everybody must manage for themselves." "But you love Mary, you say; and she returns your affection," he added. "Yes, I love her better now than formerly. I was always interested in her; and I think she loves me, although she is not very demonstrative. I don't feel that I thoroughly understand her even now. Sometimes she seems so genuine, so confiding, so fond; then again distant and reserved. I have had many minds about her. But I will not say any more-I don't like match- makers. You confess that she is beautiful?" "Yes, but that is not enough-I must go-give her my good-night?" "Perhaps you had better seek her, and say adieu for yourself. You can take the Sycamore path to the road, and you will meet her there." Mr. Herbert seemed half-inclined-wavered a little on the door-step-and then off he went, a short cut down the hill. He was no sooner out of sight, than Mary emerged from her retreat, and came toward me. I thought she was rather piqued, because he had not followed her although she pretended to be glad that the tiresome fel- low had gone. "How you can tolerate his old-fashioned, stereotype notions of woman and matrimony, I don't see?" said Mary. "I pity his wife, whoever she may be. And   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE.  85 then his everlasting doctrines-doctrines that he thrusts at you at every turn. Swedenborg says this, and Sweden. borg says that-as if I should believe it any the more, because Swedenborg says it." "Well, he is stupid enough," said I; "and if he can take a hint, he won't show himself here again very soon." "Why, you like him!" said Mary, "and I can tolerate him for your sake, and try to find the good side of him, if he has one. But as to that, he is too good. I never could like good men. They are generally atupid bores. I wonder if he was vexed with my running off? It was rather rude, to be sure; but I can't hear him discuss woman. He has such high-sounding notions; and he looks at one so, as if he thought he could see into one's soul. No man need think he can see into my soul, an inch farther than I choose to let him." "It's a way he has of fixing his eyes on the person with whom he is talking," said I. "He ought to know  how disagreeable it is, for really, I believe he squints a very little! But I doubt if he gives us an opportunity to tell him anything very soon." "Squints!" exclaimed Mary; " why his eyes are'su-  perb! But you don't really think he is offended at my leaving him?" she asked, with earnestness.  "I think he had some reason to be," I replied, " and I doubt if he puts himself in the way of a similar rudeness again very soon." "A straw for a man so touchy as that! No man, of any real manliness, would take any notice of such a petty affront from a woman. It just confirms my opinion. A jealous, suspicious man!

Now, by the light of this moon, can you swear you speak the truth?" "By the light of this moon, I swear nothing," replied Mary. "I know that I worship truth in the abstract- that I wish to be true-and that I am true to myself, even in my vagaries. So good-night, dear; and believe, in spite of my waywardness, that I love you, and have spent the happiest moments of my life, in this sweet home of yours." "I wish you had one as sweet, or sweeter, Mary," said I; "you deserve it." "No, Alice," said Mary, turning away her face, so that the moonlight fell full upon it; "no, I do not de- serve one yet. I could not make one happy. Sometimes I feel that I am all wrong-that my life has been all wrong-all selfishness. But I can't make the lines clear yet. Good-night, dear;" and kissing me tenderly; more tenderly than she ever had done before, she went to her room. *    *    *    *    * You seem so interested in Mary, that I cannot refrain from writing more of her.

I heard that he was absent from the city, with a sister   THE EVEBY-DAY LIFE OF- EVERYDAY PEOPLE. 87 whom he loves, who is dying of consumption. I told Mary what I knew of this sister, and interested her very much. She seems to like to hear me talk of Mr. Her- bert, but says nothing herself. The autumn days are coming; and our forest leaves are changing. With these low winds sighing round me- these faded leaves scattered along the paths, or "heaped in the hollows of the grove "-come memories of the past, that throw a sadness, not unpleasing, over my spirit. So has the autumn come and gone, for years, in the home of my youth. So have the yellow leaves bestrewn the familiar paths I trod with those I loved-the early friends with whom my heart shared " its every thought and feel- ing." And over the grave of my early-lost, these chang-e ing leaves are falling; and these mournful winds seem to breathe the requiem of my blighted hopes, laid low in the dust, where lies my first-born. Can I be otherwise than sad? for oh! how my heart loved him! May I not be sad, without sin now, when all nature is filled with the tokens of decay, and every breeze sounds a dirge through Nature's desolate temple. Now, how I long for you, friend of my youth, who have known me from childhood, that I might, without restraint, unburthen my soul once more. -But I cannot here, where none know me-and none knew him-the bright bird who has left my Paradise, for the garden of God. I must not be sad, for it will distress my good husband. My sorrow is his sorrow- but we feel it differently. It is the difference between man and woman. I cannot tell you how ever-present my loss is to me. Sometimes it creates a yearning that cannot be uttered-to see him, and to clasp him in my mortal arms once more. ^        31    k *  -     88     THE OLD CORNEB CUPBOARD; OR, You ask why I say nothing about Mr. Herbert. I have had nothing to say until now. You recollect I told you of his departure from town, to visit his dying sister. He returned a week ago, and brought the little orphan girl of the departed one, home to his father's house. He looked sad; but spoke of Emily so affectionately, and so cheerfully, that we all felt it was wrong to mourn for her. Mary never appeared so well. Of course it is no time for jokes and badinage, and her manner has a serious thoughtfulness, that renders her very interesting. She is softened; and her voice is full of feeling. Can it be possible, that she is really interested in Mr. Herbert? or is it only sympathy with his sorrow Z The other evening, after he had gone, she said to me, "There is something very beautiful in Mr. Herbert's views of death; and he seems to believe them with his whole heart. I wish mine were as consoling. Death! the unsolved-the awful mystery! The skeleton at every love-feastf the heart! Death! the end of all certainty- the fearful leap into the unknown! Alice, are Herbert's convictions really anything more than pleasing fancies?" "We can only judge by their effect upon his life," I replied; and I brought out a little book he had lent me, which we read together, with great interest, till inter- rupted by my little girl, who was clamorous for atten- tion-when I left to give the children their supper- and Mary strolled out to enjoy the glorious twilight, through the old wood-her favorite resort. The sunset was gorgeous; and the harvest moon rose magnificently in the east, while the west was yet glowing. We have a late tea, for my "gude man" is always late from town; and I put my little girl to sleep, before his return. This night he was later than usual. The moon was quite high, before he arrived: and when the tea was ready,   THE EVERY-DAY LIE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE . 89 Mary was beyond the reach of our voices, for we called repeatedly, and she did not appear. I was quite alarmed, for our house is isolated, and I knew it was not prudent for her to venture very far alone, at that hour; but my husband re-assured me, by saying that he passed Herbert walking out, and probably he had found Mary in the path, or at the spring, and joined her. I was quite satis- fied with this explanation; and we sat down and took our tea alone. Somewhere about ten o'clock, the run- away appeared-whispered a few words to me, which I did not hear, and went to her room. In great bewilder- ment, I went on the porch, and there stood Mr. Herbert, leaning against the pillar, looking awfully serious, and, I fancied, very unhappy. I tried to rallyhim, and begged him to come in and take a cup of tea, but he declined, and said " he must be on his way home." I couldn't let him go, looking so disconsolate; and mustered courage to ask him what under the sun had happened? If he had been quarreling with Mary--and what she had been saying, that neither of them could take any supper. But not a word could I make him tell me, except that he would see me to-morrow-and off he went. It was such a glorious night; and I was so ex- cited that I could not go to bed; and seated myself on the porch, to use my Yankee privilege of guessing. A light tap on my shoulder, startled me. It was Mary. "Are we all alone?" said she. "Quite so," I replied. "No husbands about "  "None," I answered, "so sit down and tell me what is the cause of these strange do- ings Why you did not come home to tea? and what you said to poor Mr. Herbert, to make him look so woe- begone?" "Did he really look sad?" asked Mary. 8     W     TE OLD CORNEB CUPBOARD; OBR "Indeed, he looked," said I, " like a man whose feel- ings have been hurt; and I am provoked with you, for saying bitter things to him, just because he is a good man; and you despise good men who have feelings." There was a half smile on Mary's face, but a tear in her eye, which I could see plain enough, glistening in the moonlight, as she said, "Perhaps I have learned to like good men--and to respect feelings---since I made that silly speech." "I hope you have, Mary," said I. "Really-do you hope so, Alice 7 " she asked, eagerly. "Really," I answered. "Then I confess to you-and I tell the truth-I have learned to value goodness, and to respect feeling, in the person of that best of men. And I will confess still more, if you will listen. I have always known how to value him better than I was willing to acknowledge. I don't know how it happens. He is very unlike the ideal I had formed, to myself, of a man. He is not a genius, not a man to shine in society, not one to dazzle and fas- cinate, but he is a man to love. He is the only man that ever revealed to me my own heart. I held out a great while, against my own convictions, but now----" "You have confessed--" "No, no, no, not yet. Something prevented me. I could not quite say it to-night. I wasn't quite prepared for his avowal." "And so you let him depart in uncertainty?"I asked. "I don't think he is very much in doubt; but I wanted time to understand myself. I have tried to think I had no heart, that love and romance were all childish non- sense; but I doubt it now-they seem vastly real!" "Seem! nay Mary, they are so," I said. "You say he has no genius, and will never shine in society. True   I,     THE BEVRY-DAY LIFE OF EVEBY-DAY PEOPLE.  91 enough-but he will shine in the sphere of home and dif- :! : fuse genial warmth and light there, where most they are needed; and where your heart can best be nourished and strengthened by them." A multitude of thoughts rushed over me, and my foolish tears, always ready to flow, fell profusely. It is a holy moment, when the heart acknowl- edges the power of a deep and fervent love, and is ready to yield all-everything to its might. Mary too, began to weep; and there we sat silent till my husband put his head out the window, and asked us if the cock was crowing to " usher in the dawn?" At which signal, we parted. The next day Mary said little, but I knew she was happy. Fortunately, I thought of an errand to town in the afternoon, and drove in, just about the time Herbert generally made his appearance, having told my husband previously, to wait until I came for him. We made a few social calls to pass away the time, and rode home by !  moonlight. I saw, by the looks of my friends, who came out to meet us, that all was right between them. I took both their hands in mine, but I had nothing to say. I never have, when the occasion seems to demand it. Mr. Herbert looked so happy, and Mary so serenely beautiful, I blessed them in my heart of hearts. May God bless them.  I can write no more at present. *    *    *     *  .  You have heard me say many times, that I had great faith in first impressions, in the sort of instinct which draws us to some people, and repels us from others. I have sometimes found myself mistaken, but very rarely; and often after temporary vacillation, I return again to my first instinct. You remind me of all I have said, in past years, about Mary; and ask whether I suppose she is really metamorphosed by love, or whether I have, for     92     THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, so long, been mistaken in her? or if all the good I now find in her, waited only the magic touch of affection, to unfold it. If you will recall the first time I ever spoke of her, before I had even been introduced to her by name, you may recollect I said I had seen some one at a party, at -  place, whose face interested me more than that of any person I had ever met. I felt the strongest desire to know more of her, and was irresistibly drawn toward her. We did not meet again for some months. In the means time, I heard rumors of her being the object of admira- tion, to several gentlemen, and among others, to Mr. H--, the pet of society-admired for his intellect and cultivation, by a certain set, in which Mary reigned a " bright, particular star." When I met her again, Mr. H-- was married; and Mary, who had inherited a large fortune, by the death of her father, was living in independence, and very much courted in society. I was then, for the first time, introduced to her; and although her beauty and talent fascinated me, the peculiar charm, which at first captivated me, was gone. There was an effort to shine-to say brilliant and startling things-and a sort of defiance of the opinions of the world, that passed, with some, for truth and independence-but seemed, to me, vastly like egotism and affectation. I saw that she deceived herself even more than others. The real beauty of her character was lost. The true womanliness had vanished. It was with these impressions I wrote to you of her. They were totally at variance with my first in- tuitions, and yet, from time to time during our inter- course, glimpses of her real self shone through her assumed character, and she was always a fascinating study to me. It is true, she is changed, but the change is a return to herself; and again I feel for her that real heart-interest with which she at first inspired me. I con-   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 93 sider it a most fortunate circumstance, that she met with a man like Mr. Herbert, before those false habits of thought and expression had become a second nature and before she had passed the freshness and beauty of youth, and her heart, without objects to call forth its affections, had become soured and embittered by the loneliness of a single life. To be sure, Mr. Herbert is the last man I should have supposed Mary would fall in love with. He is eminently a good man-by no means a brilliant one. But he is sound, sensible, affectionate, and perfectly true. His heart is good and noble. Added to these sterling qualities, he has very good looks-is manly and dignified in his bearing-well educated--po- etical enough-and keenly alive to the beautiful in nature and art. With more culture, he would be more attrac- tive; but he has a reserved power-capabilities yet to be unfolded; and it will be Mary's privilege to develop this, the aesthetic part of his nature. Few of our young men have opportunity for the cultivation of their taste in the higher departments of art. Mr. Herbert is a business man. He has been compelled, from early manhood, to carve out his own fortunes. By dint of persevering in- dustry, he has amassed a very pretty property. Abund- ance of means, and abundance of opportunity, will now be opened to them; but whether they will be the happier for it, time alone will determine. I smile inwardly, to think of the sensation this engagement will excite. Mary has been much admired by gentlemen, but few have ven- tured to make love to her; and of those few, that the plain, unassuming Mr. Herbert should have been the favored one, is, indeed, extraordinary-only that matches always surprise us. The two love affairs that have interested me most, next to my own, are entirely dissimilar. One, you crecol-     "    THE OLD CONEt COUPBOARD; OB, lect, was the youthful attachment of my early friend Bes- sie, full of poetry and romance. This was the poet's elysium of love! A halo of beauty surrounded it, and the story of their lives seemed more like a fairy tale, than reality. This that interests me at present, is the mature choice of two strong hearts, with whom the first flush of romance has faded, but within whose quiet depths has grown up slowly, the conviction that their happiness could only be complete in each other. Which do I prefer, do you ask? Oh! by so much more, the latter--the real--the known-the comprehended. The first is for poetry--for day-dreaming-when we close our eyes in reverie. The other is for the battle, and conflict, and reality of life. I doubt very much if half of these matches made in early youth, prove truly a union of souls. The one I allude to, has been fortunate and happy-but for so many others--look around you, and say if the fullness of joy, springing from a union of hearts, is to be found in their homes. These aimless women--faded prematurely-broken in health--without purpose-without energy; these frivolous vanity-fair dolls, whose sole object in life, is to hang gew-gaws about' their persons, and simper and smile, in so-called society; and these haggard, care-worn faces, with their abstracted look, as if they had no hopes-these tell the story of many a young and passionate, but misplaced attach- ment. Nor is it among the wives alone, you can see the sad tokens of disappointment: but man can run away from his misery. In business, in pleasure-and if no principle restrain him, in other alliances. But the wife sits among the wrecks of her young dreams, happy, if in her fidelity to duty, or her maternal love, she can create a new altar for her crushed affections.

When I saw Mary caressing her, and looking i:!  upon her with eyes of such deep tenderness, I could hardly believe it was the strange, wayward, restless girl ,If: of last summer. Her very countenance is changed; the light in her eye is softened; and she has almost a Madon. ,   na-like beauty. That satirical expression-that scornful curl of the upper lip-is all gone. She has not lost her sprightliness, and often entertains us with playful sallies; but her ordinary manner is subdued, and rather serious. 1t  Her whole heart, and a great heart it is, is Mr. Herbert's. As for him, he seems to tread on air. Little recks he of the distance between our house and town. He comes over every afternoon. It is a sweet, sad time for lovers. The haze of the Indian summer hangs like a curtain over the leafless woods, and through its filmy tissue the outline of the distant hills melts away into cloud-land! Oh! best of friends-! why cannot the heart go out of itself at all times, and rejoice with another's joy? Why do we turn our lingering, longing souls back over the paths we     96     THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, cannot tread again, as if we had lost, by the lapse of years? What has gone from us?

Yet if it were only possible, in this world, for one heart to read another, without the need of words! The poet pours forth his soul in song. He writes because he must.

She would not be- lieve it, till I verified it; and then I could not make her believe that Mary was really in love. "However, that is of but little consequence," said she, " if they mutually respect each other." I shook my head. Such doctrines do not suit my ideas. "You may look as grave as you please," said Mrs. D'Harcourt; " it matters very little whether people are in love before they marry or not, provided they have a well- grounded esteem for each other. I know you are a great advocate for love. I have heard of your saying you used to watch to see your lover pass a certain corner of the street, and to catch even that short glimpse of him, was joy enough for one day. But I don't believe you are any happier now, than I am, who never pretended to be in love before marriage, but feel a stronger affection for my husband every year!" "That may be," I said; " but I have what you have not-the pleasant memory of that happy time when the mere presence of the beloved object was enough to fill me with joy. I have something that you have not, and never can have." "And therefore I ought to be dissatisfied, I suppose?" said Mrs. D'Harcourt. I wondered to whom I had made that silly disclosure; and for the thousandth time in my silly life. I blamed my foolish tongue, that could not keep my-own secrets. However, I still maintain that I am richer than Mrs. D'H., for my past holds a joy that hers can never yield."

How many sheets I shall fill, before I have done, I dare not think; but you are, by this time, accustomed to my missives. The other afternoon, Mary and I were, as usual, sitting on our porch. The day had been soft and balmy, although the autumn is now far advanced. We had been talking, with open hearts, of the past and future-of her past and fu- ture-not mine, for I live more in hers than my own just now, except as I find reminders of my own, in the pages she turns over. She alluded to her early attach- ment, of which I have before spoken to you. "I have told Frank," (meaning Mr. Herbert) "all about this, my only approach to being in love," said she; "and I can say with truth, looking back upon it from this dis. tance of time, that it was nothing but a fascination-a sort of infatuation." "That may be said of love, in general, may it not?"I asked, quizzically. "As people think," she replied, "but you and I know better. Mr. Dudley, my former flame, is a man of intel- lect, and great attainments, with a seasoning of vanity, and a towering ambition. With the reverence I felt, at the period of our acquaintance, for intellectual superi- ority, you will not wonder that I was fascinated by him, particularly as he manifested a decided preference for my society. To be the companion of a man of acknowledged genius and learning, seemed to me an enviable distinc- tion. To be at the head of a circle devoted to aesthetic culture, was my ambition. I was bewildered with the false glitter of the little set to which I belonged. To shine in literary circles-to talk well--to control, by my intellect and wit, was, in my stilted and conceited      100    THE OLD CORN E CUPBOARD; O, judgment, the only thing worth living for. Common. place people were my detestation. I will give you my definition of common-place people some other time. "Well, Mr. Dudley seemed very much to admire me. I was rich-well-looking-and had the reputation of be. ing a genius. We were constantly together. His society became a necessary excitement to me. But, all at once he amazed our little coterie, and myself particularly, by getting married! He disappeared from us for a few days, and returned, bringing back a wife; a simple, unso- phisticated little girl from the country. I often tried to unravel, what seemed to us all, the mystery of this singu- lar choice. I have thought, lately, it may be traced to something higher in his nature, than his ambition of intellectual distinction. I am inclined to believe he had a lurking suspicion, that the constant encounter of two shrewd wits, would make a home rather too piquant for common life; and that the quiet devotion of a simple, loving heart, would be a relief from the insatiate de- mands of society, such as ours. We predicted domestic discontent; and were quite sure that his home would be insipid to him, after a time. But justice demands of me to say, that he appeared really happy there; and, al- though justly distinguished in the literary world, he has ever seemed satisfied and happy in domestic life. The simple heart that loved him, filled the void that the homage of the world could not satisfy. There was in her no restless striving to stand upon an intellectual equality with her husband. She had a just appreciation of him, but never sought to come into competition with him. I might have called her common-place once: I should not do so now. I should say she filled her sphere, in a beautiful and graceful manner; better than I should have done, had I been his wife at that time. She makes   THE EVERY-DAY LBE OF EVERY-DATY POPL1. 010 him happy, and is far happier herself, than I could have been. "After they were married, I felt listless and unsatis. fled-not positively unhappy-but I felt the need of excite. ment, and being my own mistress, I resolved to travel in Europe, and joined a party of my friends, who were going- to reside in Florence. I enjoyed myself much in the society of gifted people, and in study; but I was restless for want of an object. Mental culture, as an end, is not enough to satisfy one's nature. I often asked myself as Frank asked me not long ago, to what purpose am I thus using my time and my energies, in constantly oramn ming- adding more and more to my acquisitions. Who am I enriching by it? Had I been compelled to turn my accomplishments to account it would have given a zest to my life. As a means to something useful--some- thing that could benefit others-my culture would have been a source of happiness to me. As it was, I felt burthened with an ever-present consciousness of being alone-of being nothing to any one. I wonder I confess it. A few months ago, I should have been too proud to acknowledge it, even to myself. "When I returned from Europe, I became interested in one of the prominent reformers of the day. To satisfy this vague longing for an object in life, I plunged head- long into the new ideas that were gaining ground in our choice circles. I became a very expert talker about equal rights, and myself lived the most luxurious and indolent of lives. Early habits of indulgence were strong as bands of iron about me; but my opinions were on the side of the dignity of labor, and an equal division of property. However, do me the justice to believe, that my heart condemned my own aimless and purposeless life, all the while, and I used to wish that something Lat     102    HE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, would deprive me of my abundant means, and the ne- cessity of earning my living, compel me to exertion. It did not then occur to me, that I should ever marry. I knew that gentlemen admired me, but I thought I never could be an object of love." "And now tell me," said I, "if it is not an impertinence in me to ask, tell me if the prospect of a single life made you ever unhappy?" "I will tell you as far as I can understand them," said Mary, with that earnest smile, which means so much, "precisely what my feelings were; I would not have told you then. I am not without intellectual vanity, as you must have discovered. That, and a sort of outside stoi- cism, helped me to deceive myself and others. But there were moments when nobody saw me, when, in contem- plating the rational happiness of domestic life, and the joy of maternal love, which I have seen in you, my heart has cried out, with a feeling of isolation. Yet, had I never loved-had I been condemned to a single life-the world-my best friends would never have seen by any out- ward manifestation, that my lot was not of my own choos- ing. I think I should have been bitter and sarcastic. But one thing would have saved me from it-that is--a true heart-religion. Yet, how could I have learned that?

I am afraid I never should have learned it so. I have been taught it by happiness. It is only in living for others, that we can taste the blessedness of life." Just at that moment, the postman arrived with letters, and inter-   THE EERY-DA LIFE OF EVERY-DAT PEOPLE.  103 rupted our conversation. Imagine'us at this point, read- ing our respective documents. After an hour, Mary and I met again on the porch- she with an open letter in her hand, and marks of strong emotion in her countenance. "Can you imagine what I have to tell you,. Alice?" said she. '"No bad news I trust?" said I. "That depends upon the way you look at it. This morning I believed myself rich in this world's goods; but now, I find myself, not quite a beggar, but quite as poor as once I wished to be. The Bank has failed where most of my property was deposited, and nothing remains but some interest in wild lands, lying off, Heaven knows where, in some unexplored region this side the Rocky mountains." "You shock me," said I. "What does it mean?" "Nothing, but that I have lost nearly all of my goodly fortune. You must know, ever since I came out west, I have been anxious to invest a part of my property in the purchase of lands here or elsewhere, having caught the fever of speculation that runs so high just now. But my very safe guardians disapproved of my running any risk, and insisted that I ought to keep on the safe side- which was to shut up my money in a Bank, from which, to be sure, I could draw all, and more than I needed, but which, as it now appears, will never yield me any more, having broke, and gone to pieces. I very much doubt, whether I have enough on hand for a wedding outfit, and now, I must go to work in earnest." "Mr. Herbert!"I exclaimed, "will he not be sur- prised a?" "He will find me, I fear, anything but a helpmate, un- less I begin betimes to put my shoulder to the wheel." "Two years ago," added Mary, after a pause, "I     104    THE OLD CORER CUPBOARD; OB, should have felt this sudden reverse of fortune a relief. Now, it comes as rather a startling reality. Now, I re. gret it, but more for the sake of others, than my own. I had formed many beautiful plans for our future. Revisit- ing Europe, with Mr. Herbert to share my enthusiasm. Pleasant pictures have floated through my imagination, and all those scenes of beauty and interest were bathed in a new light. But these dreams must be given up now. We must be economical, homespun people. I must learn housekeeping, and other practical duties. Well, well, it is all right. I am richer than I was a year ago, notwith- standing the failure of the Bank; '" for," she said smiling and putting her arm round my waist affectionately, " the best part of my fortune is safely invested in a Bank that cannot fail, and never stops payment." "There, you speak truth," said I. "You run no risk there. But what will he say?" "He will be sorry for me," said Mary. "He thinks I have been so long accustomed to luxuries, that they are necessary to my happiness. And he is partly in the right. It will no doubt be difficult for me to remember that I ought not to indulge my tastes and whims-to go and come, and do what I like. It will cost some effort to give up my selfish gratifications, and to acquire a system- atic habit of using my time and energy. I am, as you have had ample opportunity to know, a lazy, self-indul- gent person. Since I knew Frank, and have heard him talk so much about use, I have felt the strivings of a better nature within me, and resolved to do something for the sake of good to others. The good God foresaw that I should never have had strength and perseverance to overcome old habits and form new ones, with the choice still remaining in my own hands, of self-gratification or self-denial, so you see, by removing the temptation to   nI    TETH VEN Y-DAY LIFE OF O VEVY-DAY PEOPLE. 105 indolence and inefficiency, He has made it easier for me do my duty. I ought to be thankful." "But you talk of economy and exertion, as if Herbert "In comparison with what our united fortunes would have been, our present' means will be limited; but there he comes." "What Oh, I forget; there is but one man in the world." "Except your husband," added Mary. "We will shake hands on that," said I, "and pledge ourselves to affirm in the face of all the world, that hu. manity has not vanished from the earth, while they are on it. Now, I will to my own meditations, and leave you to unfold this new phase of your history to Herbert." After tea, while I was busy about my little household matters, Mr. H--, who was standing with Mary in the hall, beckoned me to join them. "I want you on my side," said he. "I am there already," I replied, taking my stand at his right. "I wish you to use your best friendly influence with Mary, on a matter of grave importance. She will tell you what it is when I am gone." Mary just then slipping into the parlor, (I suppose I had a very inquisitive look,) Frank drew my arm within his own and said, "I will tell you myself, if you have leisure to bestow upon me." "We will take a stroll down the Sycamore path," said I, and nodding to Mary we passed out together. "You have heard the intelligence contained in Mary's letter?" said he. "It will make a great change in her way of life," he continued, " and if I hadn't fill faith that what we call the accidents of life, are the good intentions of God towards us, I should say it was, for her, a sad loss     106    THE OLD OORNE OUPBOARD; OB, But she does not regret it on her own account.

The little Emily will live with them. , All I could say dies away in a heart-felt prayer for God to -bless them. How rich is life! what a holy thing is affection! I do not mean one tie merely--but all the sweet ties that "bind our race in gentleness together "--love, friendship, maternity. Is it not a blessed thing to live? My heart overflows with gratitude:to God for the beauty, the rich- ness of life, the capacities he has given. us for happiness.' His love flows into our souls--we are partakers of his nature who is love itself. Through how many channels his peace and joy pass into our lives, and through ours into the lives of those about us, linking us together in one holy communion-God's children! In my youth I sighed for happiness. I tasted joy-I was bewildered. I sought for pleasure, and yielded myself to its fascination, but happiness was still the dream of my soul, ever sought, never found, till my heart was at rest in the consciousness of God. Mary and Herbert have gone on their bridal tour! How I miss them! They have left Emily with me, and a sweet little companion she is, not only to: my children, but to     108    TEE OLD COBNEB CUPBOARD; O0B me. She is three years older than my daughter Nelly, and rather a subdued, womanly little creature, having never had the companionship of children of her own age. I am glad to see that she takes to country pleasures so naturally. She is quite the opposite of Nelly, but I think they will be of use to each other. I let them play out of doors most of the day. I am not anxious to cram' the minds of young people with book learning. They study an hour or more in the morning, and sew awhile in the afternoon. They are very eager to help fie in my house- hold duties -a desire which I encourage to the utmost. It is among their privileges to wipe the silver and china; dust the parlor, and help to make cakes and pies. They feel then that they are of importance, and that is a happy consciousness for old and young. I think you would be pleased with Nelly, albeit she is, as her mother was before her, a troublesome child. She is active and very restless, unless constantly employed, but she has a grand faculty of amusing herself. Her eager mind is ever on the alert. Her eyes discover wonders in everything. When she returns from her rambles in the woods, she brings her apron full of curiosities, odd-looking worms and insects, petrifactions, snail-shells, pebbles and plants, all of which, to her eyes, are marvels of beauty. Of these she has formed a miniature cabinet, which it is her great happiness to have admired, and there seems indeed no end to the number or variety of her treasures. I can not walk with her without having my attention directed to this and that object of interest. One of her most fascinat- ing duties is to bury dead caterpillars and insects, mark- ing the spot where they repose amid the solitude of the old forest, by many appropriate emblems. Of death she knows little except what I have told her in answer to her eager questionings. I have endeavored to give her the   TH EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 109 most healthful and cheerful views of the life beyond this, of the reality and nearness of the spiritual world, for I would not have her young life clouded by the terrible ap- prehensions which made the thought of death so fearful to me. It is so easy for a child to believe in the reality of another life-the fatherly love of God, and the happi- ness of good'spirits, particularly of little Children, whom the Lord loves to bless. Where I imbibed my first terror of death and the unseen world, I cannot now remember. Dim recollections of my youthful shrinking from the tokens of its presence-from the coffin and the shroud, come over me even now, and with them a creeping shud- der. The first time I saw a corpse, the solemn faces, the darkened room, the suppressed voices, the weeping friends, and more than all, the cold touch of the marble clay, the deep awe which crept over me as I stood transfixed, gazing on the rigid features, startled at every rustle of the mourn- ers' garments, shuddering lest the white lips should un- close, the folded hands move-ah, it was awful! Night after night the specter haunted me. Years after, when I went to my lonely little bed at night, the memory of that coffined body, gaunt, ghastly, unearthly, rose up before me; and fear, such fear as made my very heart stand still, took possession of me, combined with that oppressive feel- ing of the mystery of the hereafter which awaited me, when I too bodily, should be laid stiff, cold and insensible in my coffin, and my soul should have gone to be judged by its Creator, the awful God who had set down my every fault in his book, that book from which my sentence would be pro- nounced, banishing me perhaps to everlasting torment- shut out from heaven and the angels forever and ever. Did I love that God? And then how many times in my childhood I dreamed of that dreadful day of doom, when the earth and all its inhabitants should be destroyed.     "O    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD ; OR, How vividly I can recall one in particular of those fearful dreams. I saw rising in the west a lurid fire, stretching from one extremity to the other of the horizon-now shooting up in gleams, like the coruscations of the Au- rora Borealis, but red and flame-like, now sinking down as in a furnace seven times heated. Men, women, and children, in mortal terror, looking up to heaven, praying, horror-struck, for pardon and mercy. Did I love that Being? can a child love a God thus fearfully depicted? From whence I derived these terrific views, as I said before, I cannot now remember. It could not have been from my gentle mother. I cannot recall the source from whence I drew my earliest impressions, but they were laid deep. They haunted many a lonely hour of my childhood, in the dark nights, when I could not sleep, and no mother's soft voice came to dispel my fears, and teach me that the God so dreaded, was my Heavenly Father, whose kind care was ever over me, whose love was ever striving to lead to himself-who had made the world of beauty for his children to rejoice in-who had given his commandments, not as an arbitrary sovereign, but as a wise Father who knew what was best for his children-who was ready to forgive-ready to help- always wishing to do us good. But the evil has passed. It was a great one-it dimmed the light of my child- hood-but it has passed. It hung like a cold shadow between me and the hopes of future life, but it can never come again. There are places, around which, hang so many associa- tions of this early terror, that I do not love to visit them, albeit they are in the home of my childhood. Perhaps, had I never suffered from these vague fears, I might not have known how to choose the good, and avoid the evil in the education of my own children, in this respect.   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 1ll Certain it is, they have no dread of death; no recoiling from the grave. It was only yesterday, that I overheard Nelly and Emily talking together. They were "playing dead," and burying their doll. They had laid it in its little cradle, amid the leaves and blossoms which the frost had yet spared. "Itow sweet she looks,' said Nelly. "So shall we look some day, when we are dead. We shall be dressed in white, and flowers all about us-and then they will put our body in the ground--and our friends will plant roses and vines all over our grave-and we shall see them growing, when we are up in heaven." Yes, dear children, cherish the thought! It is not an illusion. The heart perceives its truth in childhood, although the head, in after years, by seeking to reason upon it, may lose it in vain speculations. The heart be- lieves it still. We do not die. Life is perpetual; ever- flowing from the Fount of life. Oh! receive it ever as a little child, and thou wilt find the Kingdom of Heaven. *             *    * Mary writes she will be here at Christmas. What can we do to make the day happy, and ever to be remem- bered as a holy day? I took a walk with the children over the hill, in search of an evergreen tree for the occa- sion, for Nelly is crazy to have a Christmas tree. In this part of the country, where the soil is so rich, and the forest growth so luxuriant, it is hard to find pine or hem- lock. I think we will write to Mary to send one by the boat. Yes, it is a bright idea-our tree shall come from New England! It will seem to bring with it the old, sweet, sad murmur of the pine woods. We will have it dug up by the roots-we will plant it in our new home. The associations of by-gone years shall cluster around it; it shall have tales to tell all of us-pleasant tales of our     "2    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, early years-of lovers' walks-of romance-of hope-of the union of true hearts-yes, we will write to Mary at once. We are transplanted from that rugged clime to a new home; and our household tree shall also be brought from thence. I think it will live, if we cherish it ten- derly. We will try and not kill it with kindness. I must close now, and write at once to Mary Herbert, for it will take some time for the tree to reach us. This is one of the happy thoughts that seem like an inspiration! You may not hear from me until after our festival. Not hav- ing a full purse to draw upon, our gifts for the season, must be planned and accomplished by our own ingenuity.

THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 118 Our Christmas was charming. Everybody was happy and disposed to enjoy to the utmost. Having no neigh- bors we were somewhat at a loss at first whom to invite as guests beside our own little circle. It seemed selfish to confine our happiness to so small a sphere, and yet we could not flatter ourselves that any of our city friends would take the trouble to come so far, particularly as all of them were doubtless interested in their own way with their nearer friends. Mary and Frank Herbert with their father's family, and Emily and our two little ones were not enough. Our hearts and our house were too large and full of happiness to permit us to be contented with so limited a number. Thanks to Frank Herbert for the timely suggestion of gathering in some of the little children in the neighborhood, to whom the sight of a Christmas tree would be a novelty. It seems in his walks to and fro our house, when his heart, overflowing with tenderness to one, had " grown prodigal to all," and -his newly awakened sympathies embraced everything animate and inanimate worthy to be loved, he had made acquaintance with some of the little children of the labor- ing men on the farms and gardens, scattered at intervals along the road, and also with some of the barefooted little German and Irish children belonging to the men who were quarrying the hill opposite, and lived in the shanties near by. "Let us have them all at our merry- making," said he; which resolve was carried unanimously. We left him to give the invitations while we busied our- selves in the necessary arrangements. Nelly had saved up her pennies from last Christmas until she had accu- mulated nearly two dollars. Emily also had quite a large sum in her Bank-and we proposed that, if they liked the idea, they should appropriate their funds in presents for the little children who were to be 10     "4    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; ORB their guests. The idea was received at once-it touched the right chord in their generous hearts-to help those who needed help. Nelly also had five dollars, a present from her aunt in New England, with which she was to buy something she liked for herself, something which she could value, and by which she would always be reminded of her dear relative. I saw by her manner when she spoke of it, that there was a great question going on in her mind, whether it would be doing justice to her aunt to spend the money in any other way than that suggested. I thought I would let her settle the matter her own way. The result was, that she decided she would appropriate a small part of the sum to the purchase of a memento of her aunt, and with the remainder buy some nice things for the poor children. I was the more glad to learn that such was her decision, as I knew she had long ago fixed her heart upon a large wax doll, with eyes that would open and shut, which she thought would afford her infinite satisfaction. The day before Christmas we all spent in town, making purchases. Mary and Frank also were equally busy, and our wagon was quite a curiosity-shop when we returned. Mary went in for the useful in the shape of woolen stock- ings, mittens, comforters, hoods, etc., etc., with tin horses, trumpets, whips and similar accessories thrown in promiscuously. Mr. Herbert provided things even more substantial, and quite too homely to hang upon the tree even if it would have held them. I may as well tell you of barrels of flour, bags of meal, hams, etc., which doubtless will reach the hearts of the recipients, though it may be through a very matter-of-fact way. What a time we had disposing our wares to the best advantage, and what a fine show they made I The children had gathered baskets of moss, of which, with the   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. " help of a substantial foundation, we raised a mountain behind which arose our tree lighted with innumerable little candles, and hung about with golden apples, bright oranges, gay boxes of sugar-plums, and gorgeous parti- colored toys and gew-gaws. All over the bank were scattered toys, and mysterious packages, bright scarfs and knit comforts were festooned in the back-ground---in short it was a fairy scene while it lasted, and never did festive lamps shine upon more happy, wondering faces than those which gazed upon that magic tree and its surroundings. After the gifts were dispensed, we all went into the dining-room to supper, and after supper, Frank and my husband amused the children with various pranks and tricks-themselves as joyous as boys-while Mary and I and the old people looked on with becoming pride and admiration. "You remember our compact," said Mary, "on a certain evening?"  But I was stupid, I did not remember. "Then give me your hand as you gave it then," said she. "Perhaps that will recall it." I gave the hand and she drew me to the porch. It was a stinging night, but neither of us felt the cold. The rich, warm glow in Mary's cheek told of an inward, gushing warmth that no external winter could chill. Still I was stupid, I could not remember. "I would be provoked with you if I could," said Mary, "but I see I must remind you of a certain evening, when you and I standing here together joined hands and pledged ourselves to affirm, in the face of all the world  " "Oh! yes," said I, recollecting it all, then, "'that hu- manity never could be extinct, while two such incompar- able men lived, as your husband and mine ' It all comes back to me now, and I believe it all, don't you?

Mary Truman no longer! Married! I should like to be very serious. Something comes over me, and my heart aches to express it. How joyous, how genial he is You think he is happy, don't you, Alice " "Indeed I do," I replied. And that he will continue to be happy, in spite of my waywardness, and my imperfections? But I can't say a word more. My words choke me now. Yes, I must say this. I am glad to look up to him, glad he is so much stronger and better than I am. I never knew, before I loved him, the power of goodness. One may strive and strive, and still the great, good man ever growing more and more in God's image, lifts up the woman-soul, as to something above itself. I recognize his superiority; I love to recognize it. I am willing to be led by him; he leads me imperceptibly. You may have your own way of explaining these things, which, doubtless, is a very good way, if one can understand about your interiors, and your exteriors, your wisdom of love, and love of wisdom, which, I confess, is a mazy sort of puzzle to my mind at present. But Frank is so clear-headed, he will make it all straight to my intellect, I suppose; while, at the same time, a power above his or mine, or that of any created being, will make it plain to my heart. Come, let us go back into the room. I could talk all night, now I have begun, but I might say foolish things, besides, as I am in the vein, which I am not always, it is a pity that I shouldn't say my tender things to him who can prize them better than you; and there is always a sort of spell upon me in his presence, even now. I cannot say all I feel: but I will live it all. Now let us go back."   THE EVERT-DAY LFE OFr VERY-DAY PEOPLE. 117 When we returned to the room, Herbert had stopped romping, and was looking about for something. "The husband of a few weeks cannot be easy out of her sight," thought I. "Well that is natural, I suppose. I suppose it cannot be called silly. He seems easier now, poor man, since she has come in!"Something whispered in my heart, "Why won't it always last?" But it won't. See my husband frolicking away. He didn't know I went out, and does not observe my coming in. There he goes, romping and rolicking, like a great boy. He does not know I am looking at him; he does not know I am thinking of him. What is all this talk about magnetic influence? Does it mean anything Does it belong only to courtship, and the first few weeks and months of marriage? I thought of the past years. Such a season of romance and enchantment had been mine. It seemed a great way back in the past. How much had happened since that time--joyous and sad-how very much had happened! Did we love each other the less, for all we had enjoyed and suffered togethert Did we think of each other less, in that we had other objects-of our united love I thought of a little grave, far off in the winter-woods. The blue eyes of my child shone in upon my heart, and seemed to chide me for the brief moment of misgiving-of regret that youth and romance, and illu- sion could not last forever. Christmas was here, and could I forget to be happy? I, who had so much to be happy for The shadow passed I felt how rich I was, in the faithful and tried love of years, in the lives of my children, in the memory of my child-angel, in friendship, in the capacity of enjoyment, in the ability to make others happy. My husband was busy packing the toys, for the child- ren to take home. I went to help him. "We shall     "8    THm OLD COaMm CUPBOARD; O, never forget this happy evening," said he. "It was a good thought, as all your thoughts are." How my con- science reproached me. It was not my thought; how I wished it had been. I told him it was Frank's idea, not mine. "That's all the same," said he, "it would have been yours, only he got the start of you. At any-rate, you carried it out, which is a great deal better. You have had all the trouble." "It has been nothing but a pleasure,"' said I; and he looked so kind, so loving, so tenderly at me, and said such very affectionate words, which I cannot think of repeating, that after a little need- ful penance, by way of chastizing my selfishness of a few moments past, I brightened up, and mentally resolved that the sober, subdued happiness of staid old married people was, after all, the most satisfactory. The children dispersed early, and the remainder of our guests staid all night. We had a cozy time, sitting around the wood fire, after the juveniles had gone to bed. It was midnight when we separated. Frank wishes we would live in town this winter. I think we shall remain here a year longer however. I do not care for society; I love the country even in winter. Nelly and Posey are so healthy and happy here. Besides, you have promised to pass several months with me, and I want you all to my- self. We shall not change at present.

But I dread a town life.   THE vEBY-DAY LiFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 119 The endless hurry and confusion-the unceasing din. My ears are unaccustomed to it. I have lived so long in comparative solitude, the sighing of the wind through the trees, the chirping of birds, and the hum of insects, lull- ing me to a state of repose and inward serenity, that I am in danger of being too much rouwed, by this continuous rattling of wheels over the pavements. What are you expecting, in the way of gossip? nothing of fashionable society, for we are without its pale. Very little of amuse- merts, for we cannot afford them. Of myse/,8 my family, and my particular friends, are you not weary? If you will send me that pretty niece of yours, I think my house will be attractive to young gentlemen. All unmarried gentlemen are young, you know. There is nothing an old bachelor affects so little, as his female cotemporaries. But, as successive generations of young belles make their d6but, these quaint pieces of antiquity are foremost in the train of their admirers. And they have such an intense way with them! The young things never dream they are making love under cover of this paternal interest. If you pin me down to give my impression of society, and will take it with some limitations, I will speak from my post of observation, as an outsider. One of the disagreeabili- ties, and, in my judgment, the disadvantages, is the clan- nish spirit that pervades the community. There are East, West, North, and South-enders, New Englanders, the Lit- erary clique, the Unitarians, Episcopalians, Swedenborg- ians, Methodists, etc., etc. Now, I do not like this sqnar- ing of one's sympathies by rule and compass; but it is of very little importance, except to myself, whether I like it or not, since I never expect or desire that social position which will- make my likes or dislikes a matter of general interest. There seems to me little permanency or stability to friendship here, because people have not time to form     JZuV    THE OLD CORNEB OUPBOASD,; OB deep attachments.' Friends become estranged, who have summered and wintered year after year together; and when the tie is severed, away goes the mutual confidence of years, to the winds. The heart betrays its trust, when it changes its love. Perhaps it is so all the world over, but my experience hashbappily been otherwise; neverthe- less, for genuine, open-hearted hospitality, freedom from convention, and absence of ceremony, give me western people, such as I meet in every-day life, in whose homes I am at home. People of intelligence, simplicity, refine- ment. There are no homes in New England that I love better. And the people are alive here-awake to some- thing, if it be not to the highest end of existence. But, if you wish to know for what we are the most remarkable, I will tell you-it is for entertaining lions. Each clique has its own particular standard of testing the quality of its lion. There are fashionable lions, literary lions, and wealthy lions. Let a stranger who has a reputation for talent, in- tellect or learning, come here, and the literary clique pounces on him at once. He is mounted on a pinnacle so that all can see him, and expected to roar for the grati- fication of the company. If he stay but a short time, we don't get tired of listening; but if he settles in our midst, the chances are against him. The victim of a sudden popularity, finds himself unexpectedly fallen, quite flat, probably as much below, as he was at first above, his proper level. His "short summer, in a sea of glory," is soon over, and a " winter of discontent " succeeds. There are in fact, so few genuine lions, and these never will roar when they are expected to. But you have read of a certain animal, who doffed the lion's skin. The disguise may succeed for a while, but the probability is, in some unguarded moment, the natural bray will reveal his quality. What a hard fate it must be, to be obliged to   THE PVrEa aY BVI. a E Qor Dtt  OEOPLE.

I see very many young men as I walk the street, well-looking, well-dremed, beauish; but I suppose they have their specified orbits, which could not be disturbed without affeoting the whole social system. I do not, it is true, see any vrriety in myJ own circle, and should not know where to look for any others than those I meet there. One cannot pick one's fa- vorites, and fill a drawing-room; and the beaux are con, scious of their importance. I heard of one having said, not long ago, "It is not of the slightest consequence, whether I call on Mmrs. S---. She mnet invite us to her parties.  She cannot have a party without us2" And he, was right, unfortunately for him, as well as for his hostess. It is a misfortune to a young man to feel himself of so much importance, that he can violate: the rules of polite. ness with impunity, The young girls here, go early into society.

I had rather my child were awkward and ungainly, if I must purchase grace and freedom of motion, at such a tre- mendous sacrifice of nature. I was walking out the other day, and met a pale, inter- esting young woman, who stopped me and inquired if I knew of anybody who wanted a seamstress. Being myself in need of one, and being also extremely interested in her appearance, I asked her to come and see me the next day, and she promised to do so. Punctual to her engagement, she made her appearance early the following morning, and has been with me ever since. Knowing that nothing in- terests you so much as incident, I am persuaded you will be eager to learn something of Mabel, and I shall tell you from time to time what I can learn of her. She is not more than twenty, judging by her appearance, and her face, in spite of a tinge of sadness that overshadows it, has almost. a girlish expression. She is an American. Her father, she says, moved out west from New Hamp- shire, I forget what town. She was the youngest of six children, who died before they reached maturity. So- much of her past history she told in answer to my ques- tions; but I shall learn more of her. I feel sure she is very unhappy, and perhaps I can help her. She sits and sews all the day and evening. I urge her to go out and walk, when it becomes too dark to see without a light, but I cannot persuade her to do so. She says she is a stranger, and has nowhere to go. How sad! No friends in this populous city! I cannot see her sitting at her work day after day, with that sorrowful face, and not strive to assure her that I wish to be a friend to her. She evidently belongm to that respectable claws of New England   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OFP VERY-DAY PEOPLE. 123 farmers, of which you and I must ever retain pleasant recollections. The summer we passed together among the Mountains of Vermont, will ever be a green spot in our remembrance. To-day I had been busy below, and had left my little girl in the room with Mabel for some hours. When I joined them, little Posey was asleep in Mabel's lap, and as I took her to lay her on the bed, I saw the poor girl had been weeping. I can endure it no longer, I must learn the cause of her grief, and why she is here friendless and alone. You will wish to know what knowledge I have gained of my poor sewing-girl. I will tell you. The night I found her weeping over my child, you remember, I said I was resolved to question her, if I could do so without giv- ing her pain. "Mabel," said I, as I sat beside her it was nearly dark, and we were alone together-"I think you are not well, and I am afraid you are unhappy. Something troubles you. You say you are alone here. Let me be a mother to you. I want to help you if I can. You are too young to be friendless in so large a place, and- perhaps you do not know what temptations surround you here. I wish to be of service to you. Tell me if there is any way inwhich I can assist you, and if it will not dis- tress you, tell me your trouble, and why you left a com- fortable home and kind parents to come here?"She looked at me a  moment, as if to read the feeling that prompted my inquiries, and then turning away her head, sobbed convulsively. I took her hand in mine, a small white hand, that looked as if it had never done hard work, and I  waited until the violence of her feelings had subsided, before I spoke again. Then I said, with all the tender' ness I  felt, "Mabel, you are very unhappy. You are away from your real mother, let me be a mother to you."     124    THE OLD CORNER OUPBOARD; OR, "I believe you are a true friend, Mrs. Dearbon," she replied. " 1 believe I can trust you. But how can I tell you all. I have indeed left kind parents. I love them dearly, but love another more. I left them to find him- my husband. I walked the streets day after day in hopes of meeting him, until I spent all the money I had, in paying for my nights' lodgings, and when I met you, I had nothing left-I could not go back without him, so I resolved to seek employment." t"Your husband!"I exclaimed. "Mabel, you are young to be married. Where is your husband, and why did he not send word, where to meet him, that you might have been spared this fruitless search? What is his name  Perhaps Mr. Dearbon can help you to find him, my poor child, and you shall stay with us, until we can learn where he is. But had we not better write to your parents? They must be very anxious about you, if they have not heard from you these many weeks. Mabel shook her head. "My husband's name is Lynn," she replied, "William Lynin. He is not to blame-he did not know I was coming. My father forbade my seeing him again. But I could not live without him. I would give up father, mother, all for him. We were married at farmer Jones' house. I promised William not to tell them at the time. I fear my father never will forgive me." "What was his objection to William," I asked? "Perhaps if he knew you were really married, he would forgive you both, and take you home again." Mabel shook her head. "I cannot break my promise to William. I cannot go home without him, and my father has forbidden him the house. I wish I could tell them, for--," and she buried her blushing face in her hands. "I understand you, Mabel," said I, " but take heart,   THE EVEIY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 125 my home shall be yours, if you have none other. But tell me child, why your parents objected to your marriage. Is William a poor man Has he done anything wrong? Why did not your father like him. Tell me all, Mabel." "Oh I you are so kind," said Mabel, grasping my hand. "I thought I could never tell my troubles to' anybody." "You can tell them to me, Mabel, and perhaps I can help you out of them," said I. "Now begin back to the time you first met William. Tell me all about it." "If I do not tire you," she said timidly, '"I will tell all my story.--I was the only child left, when my father moved out west. We were well off for farmers. I never was obliged to work. My mother had a girl to help her, and I was sent to school. I was a good scholar, and my father was very proud of me. But he is a stern man. He always meant I should marry Thomas Conway, our neighbor's son. I knew he meant it, but I did not love Thomas. We had grown up together-he was good and kind and well off, but I did not love him. We were young, and father, encouraged Thomas to come to our house; and kept up the hope that, by-and-by, I should marry him. Perhaps I might if I had never seen William. Thomas loved me. He would have made a kind husband. Perhaps I might have married him to please father; but after I saw William, I felt it could never be." "And who is William, Mabel," I asked, "and what is he?" "William Lynn, was a young student from the Col- lege, in the next town. A party of young men came to our place, to spend their vacation in hunting and fishing. They lived in the farmers' families around, and Mr. Lynn boarded with us. It was three years or more ago.

My father had but few books, and William gave me poems to read, and read them with me." "It was a lonely place where we lived. My father's farm was large, and there were no near neighbors. William gave up fishing and gunning. He did not seem to care for his other friends; he was always with me. I cannot tell you all-I loved him. I was very happy, and I did not think, at first, I was doing wrong. He asked me to promise to be his wife. I felt that I ought to tell my parents all he said, but I could not. Besides, he told me it was not best. He said they saw our love, and did not disap- prove, ' for see,' said he, 'how they allow us to be to- gether all the time, and they must know that we could tot help loving each other. Besides,' he said, 'it must be some time before we can be married. I have yet an- other year to go through in college, and then I must go to Europe-and then I must get settled in life-and there are a great many reasons why it is best to say nothing about marrying, to your father or mine, at present. We can love each other just as well-and possibly they might call it all childish nonsense-possibly they might think it best to separate us-and your father might insist upon your marrying Thomas Conway-and that would make me wretched.' "The thought of marrying another, made me shudder. I believed all he told me. I tried to think I was not wicked, but my heart reproached me with ingratitude to my dear mother.

I am much more troubled about my own father. He is a rich, proud man. But he cannot separate us. If he-will not help me, we can help ourselves.' "I was too happy to fear anything. I loved too well, to doubt William. He left me, but still I was happy, for I could think of him. Father and mother both spoke kindly of him. He had- not been gone many weeks, before Thomas took to visiting our house very often, and my parents made him very welcome. My mother used to praise him to me, and .say what an honest, good young man he was, and that so good a son as he was to hip old mother, would make a kind husband. I knew what it all meant. I knew Thomas loved me. His mother many a time told me I must marry him, and come and live in the old place; and within a year or two he had fixed up the house and garden, for he was well-off, and able to do what he liked; and his mother said it was all to make the cage the pret- tier for his bird. It made me very sad. I wished that I could make everybody happy-father, mother, Thomas, and all-but it could not be. I knew I was very selfish. I was ready to give up all for William. At last, Thomas asked me the plain question, would I marry him He told me how long he had loved me-how that his only hope in the world was to make me his wife. My heart ached for him, but I told him the truth. I said it as kindly as I could. He did not blame me. He turned as pale as death. 'Mabel,' said he, 'I feared it; and I know you love another. You never loved me-and I have nothing to reproach you with. I do not know William Lynn. You do not know him, Mabel.

But what is his short love, to mine.' The tears fell down my face like rain. I felt so guilty-and yet I was not to blame. 'Oh! Thomas,' said I, 'my kind, good friend, you must not think me hard-hearted. You must be happy-you must not look so wretched. I love you as a brother; but more than this, I cannot say. Do not think hard of William. I know he is, as you say, almost a stranger, but I believe he is true and good. Oh! can we not all be friends I "'Sometime-when years have passed, and our hearts are no longer young-when all hope is gone, perhaps, I can say Ham not happy; but, perhaps then, in your hap- piness, Mabel, I can forget my own misery-but not now. Don't make yourself sorrowful on my account. Try not to think of me at all. I will not come to the house any more. You will tell your father and mother how it is. They must not blame you, for indeed, Mabel, I feel you are not to blame. It is not your fault that you cannot love me. If you could have given me love for love, it would have made many hearts glad; but nobody is to blame'--and then he left me. I felt it was, and yet it was not, my fault. I prayed for him, that he might be a happy man. I could do no more. "My father just then went on a visit to New Hampshire. He had only been gone a few days, when William came, unexpectedly to all of us. He had been very ill, and needed country air, he said. He could only stay with us a day, for he was on his way home. He had left college, and was going to sail for Europe directly, and should be gone a year. "It was a sad parting. A year seemed to me a long time. Besides that, it was full of trouble to me.

I confessed all-for now that I had bound myself to William forever, I could not keep it from my parents. "My father said it should never be-that I should not marry above me-that I had thrown away my own hap- piness-that I had made an honest and good man miser- able-destroyed the hopes of both families-and given myself to an adventurer whom nobody knew, and who probably would never come back to fulfill his promises. I felt he was wrong, and tried to be patient. I saw how many were made wretched through me-but what could I do? "It seemed as if the year would never pass. Old Mrs. Conway died. The farm was sold, and Thomas went away. My mother had a shock of the palsy, and was almost helpless. I felt as if I was the cause of all, and I prayed to God to forgive me, and help me to do what was right. "I heard from William while he was gone, and this helped to keep up .my spirits. Sometimes I thought, as my father said, what if he should forget his promise, for- get me, and never see me again? But in my heart I never doubted him. "He came back at last, the same faithful, noble heart. He was a man, and so handsome-like the pictures of knights in the old romances. Father treated him coldly. He questioned him of his family and his prospects. Alas! William could only say that his own intentions were hon- orable. His father was able to help him, and perhaps might do so; but whether he did or not, would make but little difference. It would only defer our union-it never could change his feelings. "All this he said to my parents, but much more to me.     130    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; O1, I told him my father threatened to send me to New Hamp. shire. We were but a short time together. He could not stay where he felt his presence was not welcome; but be- fore he left-oh! Mrs. Dearbon, this is the only thing for which I reproach myself-before he left, we were privately married. "Our house was not far from the-village, on the borders of another state. Our farm was on the boundary line, and one of our nearest neighbors belonged to the other side. He was a friend of Williamn's. At his house we were married. There we used to meet, after my father thought he bad gone. It was wrong-I knew it then. 1 do not excuse myself; but oh! I cannot undo it. "William went away, and left me his wife, with the promise soon to come and claim me. I heard once from him. This letter was full of kindness and affection. Months passed, and I did not hear again. My situation now made it necessary that I should tell my mother of our marriage. At the same time, I resolved to go and find my husband. My mother felt for me, though she blamed me much; my father would have nothing to say to me. I came here without knowing where to look for William; but I could not rest easy at home. Oh! could you but help me! Don't suspect me of telling any- thing but the truth; and oh! do not blame him. I know he must have written, but he probably never received my letters. If I could find him, all would be right. He would protect me. I do not, I cannot doubt him. " "God grant you may not be deceived in him, Mabel," said I. "Now take heart, we will do all we can for you. I will take care of you, for you need a mother's care. But I shall write to your parents, who I know are full of anxiety about you, that you are in safe hands. Perhaps your father may not relent at once. People, particularly   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERYDAY PEOPLE. 131 men, are often too proud to relent, even if their heart prompts them to do so. I shall not blame you for what you have done, although I think you behaved like foolish children, to marry. You might have waited till William was in a situation to offer you a home. If your hearts were true to each other they would have stood the test of a longer separation. But what is done, can't be undone, we must now think what is best for you under the circum- stances. I shall write to your parents to-night. My heart aches for your poor mother. In the meantime, my hus- band and myself will do all we can, to find Mr. Lynn. If that is his real name, and he is in the city, we can find him; nevertheless, keep up a good heart. I have plenty of sewing to occupy you, as long as you are able to sew. You must not feel that you are a burden. I need your services, and if I did not, you need mine, and I cannot prove my gratitude to our Father for all I enjoy, in any better way than by befriending those who need help. And I am drawn toward you, my poor child, by the strongest of human sympathies. I have little children of my own. I know the feelings that swell your heart at this moment; they are sacred with me-neither you nor your child shall ever be thrown upon the world. But you have promised to do as I say, so fold up your sewing, and go with my little girl on the piazza, at the back of the house. I shall not permit you to bend so steadily over your work. You must care for your health, for the sake of the husband you hope soon to meet, and for the sake of your good father and mother, within whose forgiving arms, I trust, you will find joy and peace, before a long time." It would have done you good to have seen her innocent happiness, as I finished talking to her.' She is a sweet young creature, but I tremble to think, of the disappoint-     1832    TE OLD COUNER CVPBOAUD; OB, ment that may be in store for her. From all she says of William, I think he must be true to her; but what is the occasion of his long silence? and how are we to get track of him? Why need we tax our invention to weave ro- mances and poems, when all around us are realities stranger than fiction? I will write to you from time to time of my protegee; and if you can suggest any way to help us, in our search for Mr. Lynn, do so. Mary Herbert and her husband came, last evening, to pass an hour with us. Of course, our conversation was chiefly about Mabel. Mary thinks the probability is, the name of Lynn is assumed. I dont see what motive he could have had for assuming any name. Mr. Herbert, who knows almost every name in town, cannot recollect ever having heard of Mr. Lynn; thinks it may be Lynnwood, or Lynnfield, or Lynn something else. To-morrow he will look in the Directory. Suppose we find him to be a worthless, good-for-nothng man i What is to be done? He is her lawful husband, and bound to provide for her. But if he does not love her any longerl I don't know what to think. I shall cherish her as a daughter. It is impossible not to love her. The most striking thing about her is the innocent, childlike way she has. No guile has ever entered her heart. Her feelings and affections she expressed with so much simplicity-yet there is a depth of womanly love in her eye. This morning, I handed her a little parcel and told her she must sew for herself, and I would help her. I did not stay to see her open the package. When I came back, I found her in tears. She put her arms around my neck, and buried her blushing face in my bosom. "Can I ever, ever repay you," said she.   THE EYVBY-DAT  O   VAiT Y-DAX PEOPLEo. Is$ COWe will see about that some other time,' I said, and felt myself more than repaid, in the consciousness that I had helped to lighten the load on her heart. Weeks have passed, and no clue as yet to the discovery of Mabel's husband. I am almost in despair, as Mr. Herbert, who knows everybody, cannot recall any one of that name, and there is no such name in the Directory. Mr. Rochester says, he has a dim recollection of a Mr. Lynn who lived here some years ago, and went abroad. We shall continue our efforts to discover him. It would do you good, to see how delightfully our friends, the Herberts, live. They have a pretty home, in a pleasant part of the city, small, but tastefully furnished. Mary had many choice and beautiful things at home- valuable pictures, and statuary, and some rare casts, which she got abroad; she says that now, for the first time, they give her pleasure, because others are made happy by them. They do not shut themselves up, to be mutually agreeable to each other, " the world forgetting, and as a necessary consequence, "by the world forgot ;" but their genuine hospitality makes their house attractive to their friends, who always find there a cordial welcome. The happier one is, the larger the heart should become; and those have but narrow views of domestic happiness, who think to live for each other only. Those whom Heaven has so blessed, ought to prove their gratitude, by dispensing blessings to others. And what influence so holy- as that which goes out from a happy homeI Mary's gift of conversation is admirably adapted to make her an agreeable companion to old and young, and her large sympathies -enfold all who come within her sphere. They do not make the least attempt at show, or what is called style. They live well enough, but simply,     134    THE OLD COBNER CUPBOARD ; OR, and they welcome their friends to such cheer as they allow themselves. It does not require large means to be hospitable, if one will do it in a rational manner, but it does require a generous, social, and genial nature. These both Mr. Herbert and Mary possess. We know their "come any time," means just what the words imply-and every one that comes, is made to feel at home. There is no company room, no company china or silver, no extra dainties, no bustling about to make an extraordinary appearance, but all is simple, natural, and easy. I say so much of Mary, perhaps I give you the im- pression, that she is the moving spring of the domestic system. But it is not so. They are well mated. Mr. Herbert is the best, the most genial, the truest of men, and aside from my selfish prepossessions, I am bound to say, he is a living exemplification of the power of genuine religion upon the daily life. I wish he could infuse a little of that happiness, which sheds so agreeable a sphere around him, into our friend Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester is, according to the standard of some ascetic people, whom you and I know--a good man; that is, he is strictly just, as the world defines justice, and strictly moral also. He is a prominent leader in reform, and his doctrine is sound enough perhaps, but there is a want of Christian charity in his attacks upon the evils of society. The severity with which he condemns those who differ from him, showing them no quarter whatever, is a libel upon the forbearing temper of the Master in whose service he works. He thinks it a sin to enjoy the comforts which honestly acquired wealth can procure, because so many poor, so many degraded and enslaved are deprived of them. He scorns amusements of all kinds, scorns modern improvements, scorns all recreation,   THE EEVERY-DAY LIFE OFEERY-DAY PEOPLE.  135 and employs the time that is not required for the neces- sary demands of business, in pursuing his one idea, through every ramification it admits of, in reform papers and speeches, and conventions, until he seems to see no joy in God's world, anywhere. "Who can live a healthy life, that never looks above the evils that envelop humanity, with childlike trust in Him who sitteth above the clouds, and is ever working, silently but surely for- the salvation of his suffering children I And who that thus looks above, will not take hope, and sweeten toil with that- measure of happiness that life affords I and more than all, with that Christian spirit of pity and forgiveness, which embraces even the erring in its love? i' "I cannot scorn the world," said Mary to him, the other day; -" full of evil, and sorrow, and wrong though it is. God does not scorn it; no blossom of goodness is too insignificant for his eye to mark, his love to cherish, even in hearts overrun with the rank growth of sin and ignorance. How much better to strive amidst this field of tares, to find the grain, -and nourish that; than like a de- stroyer to stride iron-shod over the ground, rooting up both relentlessly, and consigning them to the flame-of a wholesale condemnation I We ought to try and enjoy the good in life. We ought to try and cultivate happiness- happiness, 'for which the human heart thirsts every- where-happiness, which springs from love to God and man. Let us try and find the beauty, the worth, the truth in the world; and if we find what is truth and beauty to us, let us impart it to those who are so unfortunate, by nature or education, as to dwell most upon the dark side of things. "I have had my day of seeing nothing but the evil," con- tinned Mary, b" when the mystery of sin and sorrow so     136    THE OLD CORNER cUPBOARD; OB, clouded my spirit, as almost to shut out the light of God's Providence; when the burden of my own and others' short-comings took away all hope and courage; but I have learned what is good for me, I will not say it is good for all, but I think so; that we do not grow stronger, more earnest, more spiritually-minded, by dwelling upon, or trying to solve the problem of the evil within and around us, by living in the past of our own consciousness, or by thinking too much of our own states of mind: on the contrary, we become morbidly conscientious. What we need is 'to forget the things that are behind,' and the memory of which drags us back, and chains us down, and pressing on, look up with faith, look around with grati. tude, that so much of our Eden is yet unspoiled, and look within with courage and hope; for inasmuch as "God reigneth let the earth rejoice." "One can do so much more good, when they are happy," I added, "not only actively, but unconsciously. The innocence of a little child is felt as a holy presence by all who come within its influence; so the sphere which flows from inward harmony, the highest of all hap- piness-from a hopeful spirit, the sweetest of all joys- comes to those within its reach, like an inspiration." Mr. Rochester then said, "It is the fault of your doc- trine, that it does not encourage reform or reformers." "You are mistaken," said Mr. Herbert, " we believe that is not reform, which is external merely, the result of arbitration or compulsion. True reform must come from within. We must convince one of sin before he can repent of it, and after repentance comes the effort at refor- mation. We may take away the power and freedom to do evil, and yet, at heart, the man remains the same; the evil is there within. With nations as with indi- viduals, we may legislate against, but that does not   THE EVERY-DAY IFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 137 destroy the root of the evil. We destroy the freedom of action, not of will. Convince the understanding first, then aid the will, which self-indulgence has enfeebled beyond the power of resistance. I do not say that these external restraints are not necessary for the peace and good order of society, but they do not reform men, or bodies of men, and may they not, if carried beyond certain limits, exasperate so as to retard progress, instead of advancing it " "Let every one," said Mary, " who feels he or she has a mission, go forth and preach, and work, and pray for its success. But I think there are too few reformers, who, clothed with meekness and humility, and the comprehensive love of Jesus Christ, address the truth to the hearts of men. Christ said to his disciples: 'If they will not receive you in one city, go to another.' He did not tell them to stay, and compel people to hear, thundering invective and denunciation and threats upon them -dashing their idols to pieces, invading their per- sonal and private freedom, and hurling anathemas against their unbelief. That was not the spirit he manifested, as he turned his weeping gaze upon Jerusalem, who would not hear, even through him, 'who spake as never man spake, the things that belonged unto its peace.' Let us seek to know the truth, and when we have found that which is truth to us, let us impart it, in love, in sympa- thy, to those who have it not; happy if we can bring back one erring child, voluntarily, and in childlike trust to his Father's house. "These wayside apostles," said Mr. Herbert, "of whom the world hears nothing, are the true reformers after all. The intellect may be awed by eloquence, the feelings melt. ed by pathos, but the understanding must be convinced by reason, the heart won by love, before the kingdom of heaven can come." je 12  #    ,    *    *     15     THE OLD aORNMR CUPBOARD; OdB You certainly did not show your accustomed good sense when you asked me, with an earnestness that seemed to be genuine, why I did not collect my random poems and sketches, and publish them in a volume. Turn author! why, best and most partial of friends, I have not the slightest ambition to come before the world in that char- acter. And yet I used to dream of a time when I should, through this medium, establish a bond of sympathy between myself and other minds. I had a consciousness of possessing a gift that way. The fire burned within me, that I thought would in due time work its way out, and become a messenger of truth and beauty to other lives. But the dream is over. Well for me perhaps that it is. The discipline of life has been of such a nature as to con- vince me, after many painful struggles, that such was not my destined mission. The intense impulses of my spirit needed to be tamed; therefore was sent to me the neces- sity of more humble and practical duties. Looking back upon the years that are past, in one view my life seems to have been a disappointment. The inward fire is not put out, but it lies buried under an accumulation of matter-of- fact realities and duties, humble and common-place enough if looked upon through the light of imagination, ennobling if viewed as divine appointments. I am not what I once aspired to be-not that of which my youth gave promise. Nor have these hopes been laid low without many pangs of sorrow. It was not I that did it. He who knew the temptations I should not have had strength to withstand, He led me through the straight and narrow, and ofttimes thorny path of vexation and trial, to find at last a more peaceful, though a humbler destiny than that my youthful enthusiasm would have chosen. By-and-by, when I shall have gained strength and wisdom for higher uses and ends, His love may revive   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE.  189 the smouldering embers, and kindle my soul to nobler themes. But it may not be here. I think it will not be here. Still-I say it with a pang-still I am unreconciled to the stern decree- "' That I must live and die unheard, With a most voiceless thought, sheathing it as a sword.' And perhaps, after all, I deceive myself. Perhaps I mistake the flame of self-love for the glow of genius. Perhaps it is only a thing of temperament. I know that other people are deceived in themselves, why not I? It is a humiliating conclusion to arrive at, and in fact I have not reached it yet. 'We cannot always judge truly of those whom we see in every-day life, and pronounce hum-drum and common-place people. No, no, do not expect that in my lifetime, I shall come before the public as an author. When I have anything to say, and ache to say it, I shall doubtless con. tinue, as I have always done, to scribble- on paper for pre- sent relief, and perhaps, if I live to be better and wiser, I may be seized with the heaven-born impulse of writing to do good; but more than this my partial friends must not expect of me. I lack that kind of ambition which stimu- lates many of the so-called literary women of the day. I am not desirous of that species of distinction, nor covetous even of their success. The two motives which would impel me to publish are entirely opposed to each other: One would be, to satisfy the thirst of my soul for communion with other minds. The other would be-but I won't tell you that-you may guess. The first is relieved by the mere act of expressing my- self on paper; because then imagination peoples an ideal world with beings of its own, with whom for a time I am in happy communion, or perhaps, (and this thought brings a vast deal of satisfaction along with it,) perhaps what I     "O    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, call, and others look upon as imaginary beings, may be real existences, with whom I am in communion, and from whom I receive real sympathy-spirits of the unseen land linked to my spirit by the strongest affinities--else why the deep joy, the inexpressible satisfaction I feel in their society? When have I written such an egotistical letter before? You must blame yourself for asking a question that touched a certain string not often touched by other hands, but which, when once pulled in earnest, continues to vibrate a long time. Beware then how you strike it again. Weeks are passing, and we do not hear anything of Mabel's husband. Many of our friends tell us that they have heard of a Mr. Lynn, who once lived here, but went abroad with his wife some years ago, she being in delicate health. He must be living at some distance in the coun- try, and there is no doubt of our being able some time to discover his place of abode. We try to keep up Mabel's spirits, but she is very sad. She thinks that she is a bur- den upon us, and she will work beyond her strength. The children are very fond of her. I know she lies awake and weeps night after night. I cannot tell her to be strong and hopeful, for I know how useless is such counsel, while she is in this agonizing suspense. It seems very cruel of her father to withhold his forgiveness. He wrote me a short letter the other day, inclosing some money to be applied for her comfort, and, as he said, to remunerate me for my trouble. I have laid the money by for her future use, and could not forbear writing again to the relentless old man. I do not think he is unfeeling, but his pride cannot suffer him to yield. He don't know how to come round with dignity. His heart will teach him how to forgive by-and-by. *    #    *     *    THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE.  l41 I have but a few moments to announce to you the ad- vent of a little stranger, in our household; Mabel has a son, now but a few days old. She is not as well as we could wish, and we feel anxious about her. I received a letter from her father in answer to mine, sent some weeks ago. It seems the poor girl wrote a letter to her mother, before leaving home, begging them to trust her a little while, and not to go in search of her. The old man up- braids her with ingratitude. Well he may-such a sud- den blasting of his hopes for his child, and she the only one, is a sad stroke for him. I trust all will be well. He did not ask her to return, and thanked me for affording shelter to his misguided child. He said her desertion of their roof had broken the heart of her poor mother. We must try and keep up Mabel's spirits and her hopes. Alas 1 is it not true that "hope deferred maketh the heart sick!" She is happy in her little one, and yet so sad. I know it is not for her husband alone, but for the dear parents, be. reft of her presence also that she weeps. Would to God we could find Mr. Lynn. If we do not, and her parents do not receive her, I shall help Mabel to maintain herself and her infant respectably, by her own exertions. I could con- tinue to give her a home, but she would not accept it. I shall watch over her with maternal care. Poor young thing! she has erred through too much love and too little knowledge of the world; but she is innocent of premedi- tated sin. Mabel is up, and walks about the house; she insists upon sewing for me when her child is asleep. I do not wish it, and only consent, to satisfy her. She is but poorly, very, very weak. The Dr. shakes his head, and looks grave, as if he was anxious about her. I think, when the spring opens, -and she can exercise in the air, she will     15X :   THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, revive. No trace yet of her husband. I tremble to think he may be false, yet I have an intuitive conviction to the contrary. The boy is beautiful. He does not look like Mabel. He has very black eyes, full and shaded by long lashes, soft dark hair, slightly curling, and exquisite pro- portions. It must be his father's face and form. Cruel father, to desert his young wife, and helpless boy! But alas I he knows not that he is a father. *    *    *     *    * Joy! joy! we have discovered Mabel's husband I Mary Herbert has seen him, has spoken with him. I can hardly write, my hand is in such a tremble, but, as I know your anxiety, I will calm myself, and go back to my story. A few days ago, Mary was at a small gathering at Mrs. Roscoe's. Several strangers were present, among them an elderly gentleman, of a proud, and somewhat impos- ing presence, by whose side sat a beautiful girl, about eighteen apparently, his daughter. Something in the appearance of the two attracted Mary, and she asked Mrs. Roscoe who they were. "That is Mr. Lynn," said Mrs. R. Mary started as if she had received a shock. "Why, do you know him " asked Mrs. Roscoe. "No, but the name is familiar," said Mary, "I have heard it before." "They have lived several miles in the country," said Mrs. Roscoe. "Mr. Lynn formerly resided here, is immensely wealthy, and as proud as Lucifer. So I have heard. I used to know his wife. She was a lovelvy, gentle, womanly woman. He is a widower now, and has but two children. This daughter has just returned from Europe, whither she went after her mother's death, to reside with Mrs. Lynn's married sister in Paris. The son, a young man, I should think about twenty-two, will be here this evening. They have lately bought a fine house in our neighborhood, of   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 143 which Rosalie is now the mistress. Come, let me introduce you to her. The young people are very unlike their father. They seem, both of them, to be simple and unpre- tending, although evidently highly educated, and accus. tomed to society. The son is one of the handsomest young men I ever met, but very reserved. The old gen- tleman is purse-proud, and tyrannical. But come-you shall judge for yourself." - So saying, she led Mary across the- room to be introduced to Miss Rosalie Lynn. She was pleased with the young lady, but disgusted with the pomposity of the old gentleman. Pretty soon, to her relief, he took himself away. While they were chatting together, a tall, dark-eyed, splendid-looking young man entered, and Miss Lynn said, "There comes William. It was to please me that he came here to-night. He de- spises fashionable society, and indeed has taken a decided disgust to city life--declares that he shall go on a farm, and live rationally. My father is very ambitious for him, being the only son, but they seem antagonistic to each other in every way. I wish indeed Papa would let him do more as he pleases. I think it really preys upon his spirits to be condemned to stay here, and to listen to all Papa's schemes. But here he comes. Let me introduce him to you, and, if you will excuse me, I will go and chat with Fanny Roscoe awhile. Of course Mary was very glad to be left alone with Mr. Lynn; for you know, when we have any special designs upon a person, we like to have the field to ourselves. Mary was determined to find out all she could of the young gentleman in question, and laid herself out to make conversation. First they talked of the weather, and from that, being quite spring-like just now, jumped to the country, and from that, to his hobby of simple country life, and his detestation of fashionable society and fashionable ladies, in particular. This was all     "4    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, favorable to our hopes, but did not lead to the point. How to bring him nearer, was a puzzle. So Mary at. tacked him on the sentimental score, and accused him of a romantic attachment to some simple country maiden, at which she thought he looked confused; as he replied, "that if indeed he could have been so happy as to win an innocent and loving heart, he should think his lot most enviable." This led to an interesting discourse on the subject of love. Mary, you know, can not only talk fast herself, but has a faculty of drawing people out, and besides, there seemed to be some affinity between them, which made them mutually pleased with each other's society. Mr. Herbert then joined them. Mary introduced him. He saw at a glance, the momentous discovery she had made, and played, as he always does, into her hand nicely. When they separated, they both asked Mr. Lynn to call and see them, and-he accepted their invitation with real cordiality, at the same time expressing a wish that they should make the acquaintance of Rosalie. Shall I stop here and reserve the rest of my budget for another letter, or shall I go on writing? In consideration of your curi- osity, I will go on, although there is "fear lest dinner cool." My maledictions on the first of womankind, who fell a victim to curiosity, and thus brought the necessity of cooked dinners "with all our woes," upon our poor sisterhood. Well, the very next day, William Lynn called on Mary. He said he felt irresistibly compelled thither, by the power of a secret attraction, and there must be some- thing in it, as he had not visited any house in the city, familiarly, since his return from Europe, or in fact, since his father came to reside west. When he was a collegian, he was too bashful to make the acquaintance of city   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 145 ladies, and after he left college, he was sent away again immediately, and this was his first d6but into society. He staid some time; Mary was delighted with him, and asked him to come again. He said he would like to come every day-that he felt the need of friendship and counsel, and he believed she was just the person to advise him. After he was gone she came to us, and we con. sulted together, whether it was best to reveal our secret to him at once, or wait till Mabel was a little stronger- who should do it, and how it should be done. My hus- band said, "do it at once, for Mabel will never get stronger, with this uneasiness and uncertainty preying upon her." So we decided that the next time he came, Mary should begin by delicate questionings, and, feeling her way gradually, at length tell the whole story. I cannot repeat to you all their conversation. Imagine what you would have said under the circumstances. She did it tenderly, feelingly, and just as it ought to be done. He was completely overcome. He said he had written Mabel repeatedly within the last few months, and won- dered why he had. received no answer. He declared his intentions from the first were honorable-that he loved her-that she was the only being he ever had loved or could love-that he had endured much in combating his father's pride and prejudice, and that he had no other wish or plan in life than to claim Mabel as his wife, as soon as he could place himself in a situation to offer her his protection. The only error for which he upbraided himself was their private marriage, to which she yielded, at his persuasion. He sees now how much better it would have been, to have left her free in her father's house, until he could show his credentials, and win their approval. But he was led to take the step, in the impet- uosity of youthful attachment, and from the fear that if he 13     "m    THE OLD CORNTE CUPBOARD; OR, should leave her, her sense of duty, and childlike sub. mission to her parents' authority, would compel her to marry one whom they had chosen as a husband suited to her. Now he had but the one wish, which was to fly to her and make what reparation he could for the past. The consequence of his acknowledging his marriage just now, would be fatal to his hopes of pecuniary assistance from his father, but he felt able to work, and for his own part, contented with little. Only for her sake had he ever desired wealth, but the dear names of wife and child, were stimulus enough to exertion, and to employ his powers for them, would be the end and aim of his life. He wished to go at once to Mabel, but this Mary forbade, telling him we must break the matter carefully to her, as she was very feeble, and any sudden agitation might prove a serious injury. We promised he should see her to-morrow, and we have told Mabel to-day. I thought joy would have killed her. I have had my heart touched by the outpourings of sorrow, but I never felt as I did, in the presence of such an excess of happiness. Oh! how she loves him, and thanks to God I he is not unworthy! But to our sober eyes the path before them is beset with difficulties. They are poor-aliens from their paternal roofs-young-inexperienced-all their wealth, all their joy, and all their hope, springs from love. Experience shows us how severe a test worldly misfortunes, heart- wearing anxieties and perplexities are to youthful attach- ment. I must stop now, for the dinner-bell has twice rung, besides I have no more facts to communicate. Whatever else I might write, would only be thinking aloud, moraliz- ing, sentimentalizing. To-morrow, and you shall hear again. #    *         X *   * My heart is so full, that it is doubtful whether my pen will move at all.

Mabel promised me she would be calm. How fool- ish of me to exact such a promise I I did not see their meeting. The presence of a third person would have been a profanation, but I heard, I could not help it, the sobs of the young wife and mother-sobs of joy. And I heard his voice, that was enough. I can not write to you. I have nothing to tell. Your heart can feel with ours-with theirs. By-and-by, I shall have facts to communicate-feelings cannot be put on paper. :*:    *    *    *    # We are somewhat sobered down now. Mr. Lynn has told his father the circumstances of the past few days, and the consequence is, as we all supposed it would be, he has disinherited and disowned him. Mr. Herbert has found a situation for him as engineer, with a small, a very small salary. I have written again to Mabel's father. There is but one drawhack, (for really their poverty is not a drawhack to their present happiness,) but Mabel's health is so very frail, I tremble when I look at her. William wishes to find cheap lodgings somewhere that they may live retired. He is full of hope, and so proud of his sweet wife and child. I think her pale face troubles him. I advise him to make no change until we hear from Mabel's father. Perhaps they will send for her to go home; and   if so, she must go; and perhaps she will find her lost roses in the country. She says she longs to be at home-to be forgiven--to go back with William and the baby. She thinks they could not be angry when they looked upon the child-could not upbraid William, her own true, loving husband. Last night Mabel had a strange attack of palpitation,     "8    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, and deathke faintness. We were very much alarmed about her. The Doctor told me this morning, her symp- toms were very unfavorable. Oh! I cannot bear to think that this dream of joy must so soon be over. I will not think so. But her pale cheek and unnaturally bright eye alarm me. William is with her every moment he can spare from his business. I see he is anxious about her, although he tries to conceal it even from himself. The baby is good, and makes his mother but little trouble that little she is hardly able to bear. As I anticipated, Mabel's father has sent for his son and daughter, and the poor thing is not able to go yet. Her mother is too feeble to come to her, Oh! my dark forebodings! Must she die and leave her new-found hap- piness? die, and leave those who love her and need her care? Must it be? Now my heart almost rebels. She is growing weaker every day. We cannot disguise the' truth. We cannot shut our eyes to it. The doctor gives us scarce a ray of hope. He says we ought to prepare her husband for the worst. She talks of the time when she shall be well and strong-says she longs to breathe the fresh air of home. Poor girl.! poor girl! It is not far distant-that blessed time. In heaven they are well and strong, and the air of Paradise is fresh and sweet, Mabel; it will bring health and peace on its wings. Yet we can not spare thee here, dear one. Thy husband, thy child, thy old parents cannot spare thee yet. Fold thy wings yet a little while, and stay in our earthly Paradise. It will be time enough to go, when the blossoms fade and fall here. *    *    *     +    # It is all over-the hopes, the fears, this beautiful dream is all over, and Mabel has gone home-gone and left her   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 149 loved ones behind. The little Willie Rno more can sleep upon her breast or be folded in her arms. God grant he may find a soft pillow for his dear young headt  The old father, whom my letter summoned, came in hopes of taking his daughter back with him. The mother was too old and infirm to undergo the fatigues of the journey. He came in time, thank God! to see his child alive, to give her his forgiveness and his blessing. She placed her husband's hand in that of the old man, and laying her own thin fingers upon them, looked up to heaven with such a mute appeal The scene was too much for me; I thought I could not remain there. She followed me with her eyes, as I went to the door, as if she would speak to me. I came back and bent over her. I could scarcely dis- tinguish her words--"I thank you, dearest, kindest of friends. My boy-"  "Yes, Mabel, we will take care of him;: he will be a sunbeam in-your early home, and make your mother's- heart glad." I thought her expression became troubled. "And your husband," I said, "we will all love him." A sweet smile overspread her fea- tures. "H am happy, happy," she murmured.' I stooped down and kissed her. I took her hand-she pressed mine gently. I laid it in- that of her husband, who was kneeling beside the bed, stunned by this- sudden- agony. She made an effort to rise, and looked around as if to find something-whispered, almost inaudibly, "Willie." The girl brought in the dear child. She smiled; her hus- band raised her head, and she leaned upon his breast. We brought the baby near; she extended her arms to clasp it. Its silky curls laid against her cheek-her lips moved, one arm enfolded the little creature, the other en- circled her husband's neck, and thus she died-without a pang-without a struggle. Her poor husband is almost heart-broken. But her     160    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOABD; OR, father!-oh! my friend it would make your heart ache to see his agony. "It was my unkindness that killed her," he repeats over and over again-"' that drove her from us. How can I go back alone to her poor mother? Would to God I could have died for her. Mabel, Mabel! my only child." "Father," said William, taking the old man's hand in both his own. "You do not go home alone; where she lived, my heart's home will ever be. Let me be a son to you." Farewell, my friend. A cloud rests on our house. I feel that I have lost a child. Mary, Mr. Herbert--all feel with me. Mr. Herbert's cheering views have done more than anything else to brighten the clouds which envelop the mourners. The poor old man listens to him, half- bewildered, yet eager to be comforted. They leave us to-morrow, the father and son, with the mortal remains of sweet Mabel. I am going with them, to take the little Willie to his grand-parents. If I had my selfish way, I would keep the boy. But no-his father might some time claim him, and how could I let him go? No, it is best as it is. Mr. Lynn is so tender, so considerate, so kind to the old man. His own grief is too deep for words or tears. But he is young. Time brings a balm for the deepest sorrow. I feel for them all, but most for the aged pair. The last of their household flowers is now gathered, and how desolate must be the lone winter of their days! I hope they can lift their dim eyes heavenward. Their journey is almost ended. I write you from Mabel's home. I wish you could see it. Nature has done all she could to make the spot lovely. I walked out last evening at twilight alone. My heart   THE }VEY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE.  151 was agitated by those questionings that sometimes arise within us, as we strive to penetrate the mysteries of God's providence. Those lines of Wordsworth's came to me, as. I walked in the stillness of the evening through the wood. "My friend I enough to sorrow you have given, The purposes of wisdom, ask no more; Be wise and cheerful; and nolonger read The forms of things with an unworthy eye. She sleeps in the calm earth, and peace is there." But these words, which convey "so still an image of tranquillity," were not what my soul needed. To "L sleep in the calm earth." That is not the thought that lifts the spirit above its sorrow for the lost. To sleep! That life, so rich -in all that makes life beautiful; to sleep. No, there is no death, no sleep to the soul. I do not know how far I might have wandered from the cottage, had I not in descending a little knoll around which a footpath had been worn, discovered William, who had come there to hold solemn communion with grief. I would have re- treated, loth to disturb him by my presence, for there are moments when the heart would be alone with its Creator, when the presence of the dearest earthly friend, is felt as an intrusion; but he saw and beckoned me. I sat down on the ground beside him. "I wish to say many things to you, my best friend," said he,!" but I cannot. Sometime I may hope to thank you for all you have done-for your kindness to her- which she felt so much - and to me who had no claim upon you. I feel it all, even in the midst of my wretched- ness. I cannot be reconciled to this loss; my dear Mrs. Dearbon. I cannot be resigned-- I shall never be--I have no wish but to die. What have I to live for--what motive to exertion-who is there to whom my life can     152    THE OLD COONER CUPBOARD; OR, prove a blessing I look upon the world in which I must take my part, with a sickness of the soul. I cannot enter it-cannot go home; for me there is no home. Nor can I stay here, where everything reminds me of the past, and of her. It would madden me. Here I first met her, here, in this very spot I first told my love; and here before God, vowed to live for her. But what did I require of her? Selfish boy that I was! Had it not been for me, she might yet have lived in her happy home. God knows I did not mean to wrong her. It was not a boyish pastime. She was my life. Had she ever received my letters, all would have been well; she would have been assured of my constancy, she would have waited in hope. Good God I to what dangers was she exposed-wandering alone, and unprotected, through thecity-late at night-watching for me!" "The innocent are protected by God, William," said I, ,' and you must not dwell on these things. Dwell rather upon her joy in meeting you." "Ah I you do not know how you torture me," said he. "It was that very joy, that reaction, after months of anxious uncertainty, that killed her." "William, my dear young friend," said I, "my heart longs to speak words of consolation to you, but it is in vain. I have known sorrow, yes, bitter anguish. I have drunk deep of the cup of affliction, and I know that words are powerless to comfort a stricken heart. But this I can say to you. Grief leaves us. We must be patient. We must bear our load; we must be willing to bear it, and this very submission to God's will, makes it lighter. I will not say now to you, for you could not believe me, that you will awake to higher and nobler purposes of life, even to happiness! and you will find that it is good to have lived and to have suffered. But trust my experience.   THE EVERY-DAY LOFE OF EVRY-DAY PEOPLE. 168 Hope will spring up like green herbage within your seared heart, for God's love never fails, and what we cannot accomplish for ourselves, he will do for us--in his own good time." We sat there and talked some time, and I think he was less wretched when we parted. To-morrow, we go toge- ther to the city. You ask- me if William has gone home? Yes, dear, he has gone to his father's house, if you can call that home. One of his greatest trials was to return there. Of course the old gentleman, although he cannot but be touched by the sight of his son's sorrow, if he has a human heart in him, is glad that a union so opposed to his ambitious wishes is dissolved. He offers to further any scheme his son may suggest for his future life; but at present every- thing is undecided. Rosalie is kind and affectionate, and I think will be a great comfort to her brother. He told Mr. Herbert that he was determined to be a working man, and by-and-by, when his mind was in a more settled state, he should consult with him on a plan of life. I think he will go again to Europe. I am glad he likes Mr. Herbert and Mary so much. They will help him to know himself: I am afraid his father will never bend him to his wishes. They have both of them strong and determined wills; but William's seems bent in the right direction. The old gen- tleman has no higher aspirations than worldly position. The two can never sympathize. Moving into a larger house is a great event in the lives of people who have had their own way to make in the world, step by step, through the different degrees of poverty, till they have arrived at that point from which the important questions, "What shall we eat and what     154    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, shall we drink, and wherewithal shall we be clothed," excite no special anxieties. I can truly, and from the bottom of my heart declare, that poverty has been of itself, and so far as I was concerned individually, the least of all my trials. Now that 1 can look with un- clouded eyes before and after, I feel very much inclined to make some reflections, for the sake of those who have the same road yet to travel. You are accustomed to my rambling meditations, and will take them for what they are worth. You have heard me exclaim many times. "Blessed be nothing!" but I must repeat it again now, with a little variation. It is a blessed thing to have had nothing, if for no other reason, than that it sharpens the enjoyment of something-ay, of little things. But an abler pen than mine has described the pleasure of new and slight acquisitions to one's worldly comfort and enjoyment, a pleasure which vanishes, when the means of gratification are increased ad libitum. When there has been no want long felt, no hope long cherished, no plan long pondered over, with the excitement of turning over and over the "dear idea" in one's mind, enjoying it in prospective, calculating upon the probable chances-remov- ing one by one the obstacles in the way of its attainment, the satisfaction of indulging ones-self in occasional luxuries, is a very common-place matter. And what a happy faculty it is to be able to remember just at the fitting time, all one's past self-denial! We have done without this and that seemingly needful indulgence, were willing to do without much that appears desirable, much that our neighbors' enjoy who are no whit better off than our- selves, and now, who shall say we are extravagant? All compromises with our conscience being settled, with what gusto we proceed to the accomplishment of our darling project.   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 15 Suppose it is a piece of new furniture, a tasteful ornament, a favorite dress, or it may be, the sweetest of all luxuries, the making some appropriate gift to a dear 'friend, or the gratification of some benevolent impulse, to- wards one who is in need of help! It matters but little what it is, only the less selfish, the more delicious and the more abiding the enjoyment. These are the incidents that mark golden periods in the life of those whose worldly means are limited: and to these, the rich are compara- tively strangers. Here as I sit in my comfortable, but in no way luxurious home, I look around upon one and another article of taste and comfort, the accumulation of years, each one telling its own quiet tale of happiness, perhaps some sweet remembrancer of friends whose love sanctified the gift, or some little God-sends of unlooked-for prosperity which made the indulgence of taste, not a sin under the cir- cumstances, and it is a relief to my heart that God, who sees the workings of its deepest emotions, knows that I am grateful. I have a joy in this new carpet to-day, that those never have, who can buy a carpet whenever they wish. The very hesitation, consultation, and calculation it involved, had a share in producing the pleasing excitement of the purchase, and the healthy reaction that succeeded, when it was done past recall; and now that it is down, why should I not enjoy it? And if a friend drops in, and says, how pretty it is, there is another sparkling drop in the cup, another source of satisfaction, that one's sur- roundings present an appearance of taste, and yet cost so little. But there is a drawhack, and one not always understood by people accustomed to elegance and luxury, but known to those who- have experienced the want, and enjoyed the     156    TH OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OBR means of supplying it. It is this, that these, the refiners and beautifiers of life, cannot be shared by all of God's children. I do not feel with our friend Mr. Rochester that because all cannot possess them I ought to deprive myself of them. As well might we put out our eyes, and not look upon the beauty of the earth, and the glory of the sky, because some are born blind, or have lost the use of sight, and cannot share with us this gift of our common Father. But when I look upon the squalor and filth, the disgusting surroundings of poor, unfortunate and degraded humanity, it tempers my selfish happiness with human sympathy. It is not by depriving myself of all that gratifies my Festhetic tastes, that I help others; but by imparting to them the love of the beautiful and true, in encouraging and aiding them in the development of their natures, that desire may stimulate to exertion, and exertion lead to the fulfillment of what is as needful to the harmonious development of their natures as mine. Oh! that I could raise them! That I knew how to do it I That I could take these little children from the gut- ters, from the debasing examples of vice and debauchery, from physical suffering, and disease, and neglect, and train them to higher uses and enjoyments I But what I cannot do, others have done, and are doing. I know of one, weak in body, a feeble, delicate woman, accustomed from her infancy to the comforts and refinements of a home, to the higher walks of literature and art, to inter.. course with the best minds of our day, who in the absence of those ties which bind a woman to a home of her own, and to quench the thirst of her soul for a higher life and holier inspiration, has given up her time and strength to this noble enterprise-gathering together the poor, de- graded children of the city where she lives, and devoting   THE IVEBY-DAY LIFE OF BVEBY-DAY PEOPLE. 17S so many hours of every day to teaching them what will fit them to become, perhaps what she is-missionaries of good-angels of comfort and help to others. With how much higher appreciation and devoted thankfulness must she return, after her labor of love to these poor children, to the enjoyment of the blessings and comforts of her own home I The highest joy of the angels is to impart their own happiness to others. Who that has ever made one human being happy in a small degree, cannot believe this? It is not in possession, but in sympathy, in bestow- ing, that spiritual joy lies; and the higher the capacity of the soul for happiness, the stronger must be the desire to impart it. You accuse me of wandering away from my subject, of the pleasures of poverty, my new house, etc. I told you to be prepared for rambling thoughts. Of course I must be discursive, and when I find myself lim- ited by the four pages of a letter, it is too late to return to the subject from which I set out. I know I began with our new house, and I will go back there with pleasure, and lead you through it, and you shall see, if I have in- dulged in any flights of fancy. The owners of some of our princely mansions might laugh at what I call luxu- ries and elegancies, but that does not make them less so to me. May I never see the time that I shall look back to despise "the day of small things." Did you ever see people in the world, of whom you thought, if you did not say so, they are too happy. Peo- ple who seem to have no cares or anxieties, but whose cup is filled to overflowing with earthly good, who in the midst of prosperity and the fruition of their hopes appear to be utterly unconscious that a change may come who are so filled with happiness, that they forget apparently, that life has many sorrows?     158    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, If you have seen this, you know the feeling it awakens, the sort of foreboding it causes in your mind, lest a storm be gathering, that will burst upon them suddenly, and scatter desolation over their earthly Paradise. I felt this the other day, when I was at the house of a dear friend, to whom the birth of a beautiful child has brought such a fullness of happiness, as made me tremble for them. I asked myself many times, Can a person be too happy? and a voice from the depths of my being replied; "The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, but the word of our God shall stand forever." Do these words convey to you the meaning they do to me? Let us look back over our lives-back to the days of youth, when the grass was green and fresh with the verdure of spring, and one by one in the maturity of summer, came forth the blossoms of hope and love. The June of our existence the perfec- tion of its beauty! How slowly yet surely the autumn drew near! In the still night, when we were lulled by happy dreams, it "scattered its hoar frost like dew;" and as we awoke, day after day, we saw and felt that some- thing had gone. The freshness and glory was not as of yore. "The grass had withered, the flower had faded," what then? Must we sink down heart-broken and disap pointed amidst these fading garlands of youth? Is this all? Is this the end of all our hopes? Is this life? Oh no! there is something more-something deeper-stronger -holier than this--"The word of our Lord shall stand forever." Truth-this is God's word, not the outward passing show of things, but the inward, living spirit- the immortal, the unchangeable, the essence of all life, of all happiness-tlhi shall stand forever. I asked myself, as I looked upon my friend, for whom the grass was now green, and the flowers blooming?-who   THE EVE Y-DAY mLIF OF -EVEY-DAY PEOPLE. 159 showing me with delight, her new born treasure, thought me almost cold that I did not fully enter into, or appear to understand her rapture, I asked myself. Was it so with thee, years, years ago, when thy heart first awoke to the deep joy of maternity? Was all bright, all cloud- less? wert thou light, and joyous and full of hope as she? or hadst thou learned before, through bewildering disap- pointment, that" the grass withereth, the flower fadeth?" Oh! this I had learned, but not the other. Like the refrain that runs through the ancient ballads-so sad, so like a wail-mingled the note of change with my heart- song of joy; but not till the cup of anguish was given me to drain-not till I looked around upon the waste that had laid my hopes in the dust-not till my heart seemed really desolate, did the words of hope and strength come to me with their full meaning: "The word of our God shall stand forever." When the soul feels this to be truth, a new life is begun. I tremble when I look upon the joy of those who have not felt the full force of these words. I tremble for myself that I cannot always feel them. This you will think is a sermon. Why do I write thus to you? Because I write to you everything. We have been young together; we are growing old together. To- gether we have seen the grass wither and the flower fade; we must needs understand each other. *     *    *    *    * [Note by the Editor.] Here follows quite an interval, in which the letters of our friend Alice became infrequent on account of ill-health; and the few there were, related to domestic details, which would be uninteresting to the general reader. They evinced also a morbid and depressed state of mind that might convey an erroneous impression of the real character of the writer. The next that follows     160    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; ORB bears a date some years later than the last, and written evidently in feeble health, breathes a cheerful spirit. We were all glad to see William Lynn again, after his travels. He looks very well, and the remembrance of his loss is robbed of some of its bitterness. His father is quite an invalid, and it is thought he cannot live much longer. He has had already two paralytic strokes, which have left him a mere wreck. Rosalie is a kind nurse and devoted daughter. She is not brilliant, but very good, sensible, and amiable, and exceedingly pretty. She re- joices in her brother's return, for she is very lonely. Her father is so afraid that somebody will address her who wants her money, that he excludes all gentlemen from the house, and really she has not the society and recrea- tion necessary to her health of body and mind. She runs over to see us occasionally, but her most frequent visits are to Mary Herbert, whose sweet little girls are a great delight to Rose. The "little Emily" is now quite a woman, and the most*charming, gentle and winning crea- ture you ever saw. They love her as if she were their own. Mary is the best of mothers and the best of wives, not narrowed down by home ties and interests. It is not my husband and my children, as if there were no other in the world. Every added happiness and comfort, every new source of enjoyment, seems only to make her heart more expansive, more sympathetic. You should see her with her babies. You would feel how truly happy she is, for happiness sur- rounds her like an atmosphere; but it is that heaven-born happiness that embraces all-that seeks to impart of itself to all. There is something almost solemn and very beautiful in the expression of her face. She says little about heself. "I am very glad," said I to her the other day, "to   THE EVERY-DAY LIF OF EVBBY-DAY PEOPLE. 161 see you so happy, for there was a time when I doubted, as you yourself did, the possibility of your finding in life what you desired to satisfy the cravings of your nature." "Yes,I did doubt," said she, "and I had reason to do so, for I was selfish and exacting. Thanks to Mr. Herbert's example, for he never preaches, I have learned that the heart only grows rich by giving. The happiness of my married life only makes me the more desirous that others may be as content, and with as good reason, and my joy in these little children, which might otherwise run into a selfish and unworthy excess, is tempered by the recollection how many mothers there are around me, with a capacity for the same happiness, who are doomed to drink the bitter waters of sorrow, and never know of what their life is de- prived. My heart goes out with such a feeling of tender- ness towards the poor children too, whom I meet in my daily paths, neglected and uncared for, save by Him who noteth the sparrow's fall, that I cannot be swallowed up in my own enjoyments, while they are left to suffer and perish, and be contaminated by the sin and ignorance, which haunt their dismal, comfortless homes." But to return to William. Forgive my desultory way of writing. My mind partakes, you perceive, of the feebleness of my body. He is still determined to make his own living, as if he had no expectations from his father. He says he shall be a Doctor, and I have no doubt he is in earnest now. He will certainly be a good one, if my opinion is correct, that a physician pro- duces more effect by his character and presence, than by his pills and potions. A sympathizing manner, a readi- ness to listen, to appear interested, even if not so, and if possible to be interested, a confidence in himself, a cheer- ful, hopeful spirit, and a gentleman-like deportment at "     162    TH OLD COONB CUPBOAD; o0, all times; these work more cures than Homeopathic or Allopathic doses. But what our young friend needs most, it seems to me, is steadiness of purpose. Mary gives him much good advice, and he bears plain speaking from her. I wish he would rouse himself to do something--for his own happi- ness as well as for the good he may accomplish in the world. But he is young, and we must have patience with him. When his father dies he will be very wealthy-as it is, he has too much money to know the value of it, orto think of the good uses to which it might be devoted. But I have faith in him-and we all love him as a son. I was sitting alone in my room the other evening, when I heard a ring at the door-bell. What should have brought an old friend to my mind at that moment? What mes- meric influence should have so affected me, that I seemed to know at once who it was? True, I had been thinking of Lizzie Cameron more or less all day. And that is another mystery. Why should I have been thinking of her that day more than any other? I will not involve you in metaphysical subtleties. It was Lizzie herself. She had come in the stage, that afternoon, and learn- ing that our house was very near the hotel where they stopped, she came at once to see me. It was Lizzie Cameron, but oh I how changed, from the bright, beautiful girl of years ago! Her face is absolutely haggard. The brilliant red and white of her complexion is gone. Her cheek is sunken and sallow-her brow contracted and care- worn-and there is an anxious, restless look in her eye, that tells of an unquiet heart. She was quite overcome at meeting me. I did not speak of her changed appearance, and tried to conceal from her the shock it gave me, but she   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVEBRY-DAY PEOPLE I 163 must have discovered, or was herself conscious, that I observed it, and spoke of the fatigue of her long journey, and the anxiety she had suffered on account of the pro. tracted illness of her little girl, her youngest child, as having worn upon her. I urged her to stay with us, but she declined. It was getting late she said, and Edward was at the hotel with the children. "You need not fear that you will not see me often enough," she continued, "for we have come here to live, and you are the only person I know at the West." I promised to go early the next morning to see her at the Graham House, where they will remain until they can find a home to suit them. I felt oppressed after she had gone. Her manner was con- strained, although affectionate. There was a look of pent- ups misery in her face. I am sure it was not my imagin- ation. It was not a foregone conclusion of mine that she was unhappy. Oh, my prophetic soul  But one may learn to bear patiently the absence of ha]ppiness, because this life is not all. Besides, she has children--and a woman who has children need not permit her affections to run to waste or to feed upon her own heart. I could not sleep from thinking of her, and was impatient for the hours to pass, that I might see for myself what their situation was. As soon as I had breakfasted I walked to the hotel. I found Edward, the three children and Lizzie in a small room in the third story- uncomfortable enough. The change in Edward was more marked than in Lizzie. He looks as if the fire of his life had burnt out--consumed him soul and body. His eyes were heavy and lustreless, his complexion livid, and his rich brown hair, so luxuriant when I saw him last,dwas thinned and dry, and hung in disorder over his pale forehead. He did not look me full in the face, and there was such a self-consciousness in his air when I addressed him. It spoke volumes. As he was     164    THE OLD OORNER OUPBOARD; OR, looking about to give me a chair, he stumbled over a carpet-bag that lay on the floor, and uttering an oath, called angrily to one of the children to clear up the room. The oldest girl, a delicate, retiring creature, stole away from her mother and began to pick up the various articles that were scattered about; and little Neddy, who had been playing with a wooden horse in one corner of the room, crept up to his mother's side, as if he expected a rebuke for being in the way. I felt ashamed to have observed Edward's irritability, and tried to turn it off, by saying something about the inconvenience of small rooms, when people were obliged to live in their trunks. But this only made the matter worse, and elicited a half grumbling remark about its always being so, and Lizzie having no perception of disorder-at which she tried to laugh; but it was forced work all round, and I was glad when he went down stairs. "Now my dear child," said I, as soon as he left, "you must not stay in this uncomfortable little place any longer. I have plenty of room, and my children would be delighted to have your little folks to make their vacation merrier. Come at once to our house and I can help you in your search for a home, and you will feel that the children are perfectly safe while you are out." She thanked me but said itwas not best. They could get along for a few days and Jeannie was a safe nurse for the younger ones. "You will wonder," continued she, "what has sent us out West to live. A great many reasons helped us to come to the decision. Edward's health in the first place. He has a shocking cough, and is half dead a great part of the time with dyspepsia. I thought a total change of climate would help him. Besides, it is hard to get along, in a worldly point of view, in New England, particularly where one has been born and brought up.   THE E  Vg3Y-PDA LXWF OF .VYBY-PAY POPLE. 165 Edward is not a business man, that you know a well as 1, and he never will be. He had an offer of a clerkship here, which will give him a moderate salary and not require very laborious service, and I thought that where everybody was busy, I too might find something to do to help him. The truth is, my dear friend, I am tired of mere saving and drudgery. I feel that I have energy which I might turn to account in some way, I don't know exactly what, but I am sure I can do something here, where there is so much to be done. You know it is not easy to strike out a new path in the midst of old sone and associations, and then one has a sort of pride among one's family and friends, of keeping up appearances. You understand me?" "Yes, dear, perfectly-and I agree with you," said I, "There is a feeling of dissatisfaction in the onsciousness of energy unexpended or misapplied. We feel that we are capable of doing something, and should be happier to be at work usefully and honorably," "And that we can do something more satisfactory than washing dishes and patching old clothes," added LIoe, "I would like some occupation that interests me-fills my mind and my heart. I find I am getting morbid and anx- ious, and I am not always a pleasant companion to my husband and children. My hands are busy enough, but I wish my mind to be busy too, and in the right way, I have thought of many things-teaching music perhaps, or drawing, or perhaps I Could open a school myself in our own house. I have no definite plans, but I must do something." "And how does Edward look upon your schemes," I asked  "Differently at different times," she replied, "'He i a man of moods. I tell you only what you knew before. He does not offer any serious opposition. If he has     166    TEE OLD CORNER CUPBOAID ; OR, objections, I think I can overrule them. I must act according to my convictions of duty-I must provide against the future-I must test my capabilities while I have the power. But the first thing is to get a house-- to make Edward comfortable, and the rest will follow in due time, for I am in earnest," and after talking over matters and things, the past and future, we parted. *    *    *    *    * When I sit down to write to you my dear friend, there are sometimes so many things I wish to say, so many thoughts struggling for utterance, that it requires no little judgment and discretion to know which to select. I am sorry to be obliged to confess such a degree of nervous weakness, as to render it necessary for me to keep down the emotional part of my nature, and deal with facts, bare, naked facts as they are, not as they affect me. Those were happy days, where we could be as sentimental as we chose! What a relief it was, to tell all we thought, felt, suffered and enjoyed. And now that every thought and feeling is intensified, now that we have attained to the consciousness of the immortality of thought, now that the demands of our nature for sympathy, for ex- pression are deeper-we, at least I, am compelled to say to the overwhelming flood of life that I would pour forth to you. "Thus far and no farther shalt thou go." And worse than this; when I am moved to unlock the very depths within me, a prophetic consciousness of the reaction upon my grosser nature which is sure to succeed any undue excitement, shakes its stern finger before me and I dare not rebel. The consequence is, I send you only the bubbles and froth upon the surface of my life. But it will not be so always. I believe that when I am gone, the intensity of my spiritual yearning for communion with the loved ones I have left behind, will make me   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 16 present to them, perhaps even to their consciousness. The trouble is however, that they will not receive my tokens as realities of my presence. People are so afraid of believing in the supernatural, as they call it, that if an angel from Heaven were visibly present, it would all be set down as an optical illusion, as the spiritual intima- tions we sometimes have of their companionship, are attributed to an excitable imagination, or a disordered physique. I warn you not to be so misled. "'Be not faith- less but believing." To return to sublunary things. I have said very little to you lately of Mr. Lynn, and yet he, in connection with the family of our friends the Herberts, has occupied my thoughts to the exclusion of many other necessary matters. It is several months since he retured from Europe, and although he calls the old place home where his sister is mistress since the death of the old gentleman, he in fact lives at Mr. Herbert's. If I tell you that his constant presence there is felt with intense interest by one member of the family, and that one, the young creature who to you and me seems but a mere child, you will not be more aston- ished than I was the first time it came home to my mind as a reality. Little Emily! and yet she is now seventeen. I remember when I scorned the idea of being called young at seventeen. I wish I could give you a picture of her just as she is, the inner with the outer. She is as transparent as crystal, too much so I fear to suit the conventional standard of society. She is the most innocent, the most childlike being, in some respects, I ever knew, and yet she has strong womanly character. She is full of delicate and refined sentiment, yet eminently practical. You would be delighted with the way she performs her various domes- tic duties, imparting to the humblest and least attractive of them so much grace and beauty, and even poetry. The     168    THE OLD OOBNEB C UPBOARD; OB, children love her next to their mother; indeed, the young. est little pet manifests so decided a preference forher society, that if the mamma were not a sensible woman, it might wound her maternal pride. Added to these nameless, indescribable charms, which are the sphere of her life, she is beautiful to the eyes, tender, dreamlike. Let your im- agination fill out the picture. You can easily believe that the familiar presence of such a being might'be dangerous to the heart of a suscep. tible young man, for William, though a widower and a father, is a young man still, and through the vista of years must look upon his brief married life as a sweet, sad dream. So indeed he does view it, if we may believe his own words. He seldom speaks of it, but we can see, in the mention of his little boy, that the links are still bright which bind him to the memory of his child's mother. With what feelings he looks upon Emily, we none of us know. If his heart cherishes any tenderer emotion than friendship, I doubt if we should be able to perceive it, for, although he is truth itself, he is on some points very reserved: besides I know he would feel that, in his present unsettled way of life, he ought not to think of marriage. His sister told Mary, it was one of her severest little trials, that she could not get at William's inmost soul. He was kind, affectionate, considerate, brotherly, but he did not reveal all of himself, nor that part of himself to which she longed most to be admitted. This is true. If anybody has ever penetrated into the inner temple it is Mary Herbert. Will Emily ever be received therea I wish I knew. We were all assembled at Mr. Herbert's the other eve- ning-my husband and myself, with Lizzie and Edward, Rosalie and William. I sat apart in a recess, my usual post of observation since I have been cut off from   THE EEY-DA-f LIP  O   i&Vdt ATz fOPLE. t^ migling in thB enjoymoelnt of conversation by tii' 4difflftlt in my throat.

Were they less prized for maiden modesty and truth, than the women of our tine, whom custom, if nothing else, forbids such decided manifestations of preference? Is there a reason in nature for the course prescribed by the world, or is it the out- growth of a false system of things? And what is to be done in the case of a simple child like Emily, to prevent her from wearing her heart outside for the censorious world to carp at, or vain man to flatter himself by? Who can advise her? Not I, surely. Her greatest beauty, in my eye, is her unconscious innocence. Is it not also her greatest security And is William one who could in any way take advantage of it He has his weaknesses like other men. He is much courted in society, and made to feel his own importance. There is not a mar- riageable young lady, or a maneuvering mother, who would not consider him a good match, and he must know it. I wish this was a more Eden-like world. I have heard it said by a fascinating woman, who was a good illustration of her position, too, that a woman of tact could make any man she chose in love with her. But some women are too transparent to use any arts. Must they learn them? Juliet, it seems, had an inkling that coquetry was not to be despised, but her knowledge came too late for use. She says, " if thou thinkest I am too quickly won, I'll frown and be perverse and say thee nay." Alas! she had committed herself beforehand, and so I fear it is with Emily. Besides, these coquettish arts would not set well on her; she could not learn them. They may do for women of the world. And it is men of the world that can best appreciate them. Real love makes a man, and a woman too, humble, distrustful of themselves, distrust- ful of their power of pleasing, modest in their estimate of their own attractions and accomplishments, sensitive   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY rEOPLE. 171 to the slightest defects in their own characters. There- fore William, if he really loved our child, might well feel in her pure presence, that he must aspire to deserve the first love of her innocent and untried soul. I don't know what Mary and her husband think about it, or if they ob- serve it. I hope all will be well with those towards whom my heart warms with tenderest affection. If ever the guardian angels of our lives are near to us, it must be in the dawning of that affection which is the type of all bless- edness if fortunate, and the source of such untold misery if otherwise. Our friends the Camerons, are comfortably settled in their-snug little home. I wish I knew they would be as happy as they are outwardly comfortable. They are so near me that I can run in and see them very often. Liz zie showed me the arrangements of her house with a look of satisfaction I have not seen upon her face for some time. "Now there is but one thing wanting," said she, " to make me contented-that is employment. I wish to be doing something now while I have strength, and energy, and hope. What can I do? I have made a little money by writing for Magazines," she continued, with some em- barrassment of manner; ' not that I am a genius, but some friends of mine tried to make me believe that I had a gift at story telling. But my scribbling days are over." "Why so?"I asked. "I can hardly explain to you. why I think so except in general terms. Don't you think there comes a time, in the life of every one, when circumstances, or perhaps individual .temperament forces the mind inward and creates a tendency to morbidness? It is a transition period in the soul's history. Perhaps it is a new birth- I call it the struggle of an inward death. To some I fear     1T     THE OtD COAdE  O*tOAM; OK, be, there comes no resurrection in this life; it is all struggl6 and suffering." I remembered the words of the Lord " whosoever loseth his life for my sake shall find it," and repeated them it her with an explanation I had heard somewhere, which threw a new light upon the dark questionings in her mind. "Yes," said she, (' I see the end of my doubts this mo- ment. How long the truth will be clear to me is uncer- tain, but I thank you for giving more meaning to those. words than I had found in them before. We must lose our own life,' the hopes, the joys, the satisfactions that centered in self, and accept the discipline, however severe, that is to teach us how to find a higher. But to go back to the point from which I set out. In that state of our being when this painful self-consciousness is going on, we ought not to write. We look at all things subjectively; we give to everything the coloring of our own thought- we impress ourselves upon every character-our morbid sickly selves. When we rise again to this other life-if we ever do-we may hope to do something which will elevate others. If we have triumphed, we can help others -but if our own guiding-star has set in darkness, we ought not to drag others down with us." "Why, Lizzie," said I, "although what you say is in some sort true, I don't like to hear you suppose an i in -the case. The star which the wise men saw in the East, went before them till it brought them to the place where the Lord lay. That guiding-star can never set in darkness- or if it does, it is the darkness which precedes the dawn of the Sun of righteousness." Just as I had finished the last word, Edward came in. I heard his voice in the dining-room-scolding the girl for not having dinner ready in time. Lizzie glanced at the clock. It wanted a few moments of the hour.

"1 have been beguiled into talking with you, hen I ought to have been hurrying my tardy Dutch girl with her dinner. You know gentlemen are always impa- tient at irregularity at meal times." I bade her good-by, and as I passed through the ball to go out, I heard Ed- ward's voice again. "He would go back without his dinner. There was no comfort-nothing but d-d lazi. ness.'* Lizzie mentioned my name-and I heard myself with another oath, consigned to a very uncomfortable place-one of which I feared this house was in part the type. Poor Lizzie! I see it all now. I see why she has come here to live-why she is so earnest about doing something-and oh I my sad heart, I see why it is she has thrown aside the pen that can record only the disappointed hopes and inward -conflict of her own experience. I see it all now. I told my husband my fears with regard to .Edward, which he confirmed, having met him but a few days ago, with flushed face and excited manner, disputing with a gentleman in the street on some trivial point. Yes, this is now added to his other sins of selfishness. He is in. temperate. He had not the courage to look upon the necessity of labor for the support of his family. He-the self indulgent, the petted child, the willful boy, the ex- acting man-was too weak to look his fate in the face, and meet it heroically, and so sought to drown his con- sciousness in this Lethe. Is it his fault or fate I Oh, the questionings which will arise within us, as we look upon the self-inflicted misery in the world. Let us not forget to be merciful. We see only the results. Infinite wisdom penetrates the causes-causes that lie hidden far back in the past-in the poisoned blood transmitted from genera-     174    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, tion to generation-in the constitution broken and shat- tered, which has come down a pitiable inheritance from a perverted ancestry-in the sin and the weakness that left its blight upon the homes that have been blotted out from the earth. Ought we not to be merciful I But the consequences, when they come home to us with such vivid reality, when they strike down those we love-- when we look upon the homes of our friends where are materials for happiness so various, so manifold-and then mark the desolation, the anguish, the untold agonies- hearts broken-young life blighted--can we say all is welll Doubtless in the ages, all will be well-even to those who are in darkness here; but it requires a higher faith than we can attain, to feel it at all times. But it is better to suffer wrong than do wrong-for out of gentle patience and unswerving trust, there grows up the tender bud of piety which hereafter shall bear the fruit of Heavenly joy. I cannot write any more about Lizzie and her family. It makes me too sad. I cannot hope-but I can pray for them. Last evening, Rosalie brought a friend with her to pass an hour or two at the Herberts-Lucille Granger, a young lady with whom she was intimate at Paris. Her father is an American, and her mother French. She is one of the most magnificent-looking girls I ever saw, and as brilliant intellectually, as she is handsome in person. (I am giving my first impressions merely.) Her conversation is rich and varied, for she has been everywhere, and seen everything. She is an only daughter and her father's idol. She has been his constant companion in his travels. She is perfectly self-possessed, and at ease--has a fund of anecdote and the greatest store of interesting experience. She is to pass three months with Rosalie. We were all   THE EVERBY-DAI,- LOF OF" -VbY-AIY; PEOPLE. 1i5 delighted with her. I tried to find fault, and to spy out some flaw or blemish, because a secret reason lay coiled up in my heart, for wishing her not to appear too perfect. In short I did not wish the dazzling sunshine of her beauty and talent, to obscure the soft beams of our bright even- ing star. You understand me. I am getting -quite too much engrossed with sublunary things, for one who will probably in a short time be summoned to another sphere of existence. But it is not as present good 'or evil that I look at events now; the consequences reach forward to that eternity where we shall all meet by-and-by. Yes, and as our pious friend Mr. -- used to say-all will be right in the ages. Will Lucille, with her fascinations, captivate Mr. Lynn? Here is a question that involves a great deal. He -is de- voted to her of course. . He could not be otherwise to his sister's guest. That is all right. We do not see him so much these last few days. Well, I shall be "takin' notes," and if I don't "prent 'ema," I will at least write them. My Nelly, who is quite an observing girl, said to me the other day, that she knew William was in love with Emily. I did not question her, because, as I desire to keep her young while she is at school, I do not encourage her to talk about such matters. I merely told her, she was not old enough to judge of such things. She went out laugh- ing, and had the last word too-for " mother I know it," she said as she closed the door. I hope the child is right. At least the advent of this stranger must hasten matters to a termination, and perhaps I may yet live to see my spring bud expanding in the kindly atmosphere of his manly heart. Mary Herbert came to see me yesterday, 1 saw there     176    ws 0w w      &wX C Do ; 02, was something on her mind, and divined what she had come to talk to me about. But I was astounded when she said, "I am going to New England next week, and shall take Emily and the children with me. I wish you would let Mr. Hqrbert take his meals with you." "Certainly," said I, "but why this sudden start A New England winter of all things I It makes me shiver to think of it! Why not wait till spring at least " "I may as well come to the point," she continued, "although I feel I am telling you only what you have guessed before. I have seen for some time that Emily is interested in William Lynn. I have tried not-to observe it for many reasons-I confess to having felt an inward satisfaction in an attachment that I hoped was, or would be mutual. I think they are suited to each other. I love them both, and desire their happiness as sincerely as if they were my own children. I have thought I would let things take their course, but I am now of a different mind. I have decided that for the future good of both, they had better be separated." "Do you imagine," said I, "that William is in love with Lucille Granger?" "I do not know. I think it not improbable, not un- natural. She is very fascinating-very brilliant, and evidently admires him. I think Rosalie desires it. He is of course very much occupied with his sister's guest. We need not enter into particulars. It is best that he should know his own mind perfectly. If he really loves Emily, his affection will stand the test of this separation, even under the full influence of Lucille's attractions. If he does not, I had rather she should suffer temporary disappointment, than the bitterness of protracted hopo, or unsatisfied affection. I, do not wish him to think Emily loves him, or to be bound to her by any other   THE XV1RY-DAY LIFE oF S2RYDuAT PEOPLE. 1" than the spontaneous devotion of a whole heart. I wish to save her pride as well as her affections, therefore I am determined to go." "Perhaps you are right," I said--at the same time I was dubious. I think it is best generally to leave these things to Providence. "Poor Emily!"Yes, poor Emily. I know it will be a deep sorrow to her, when she comes to understand her own heart, which she does not now. But she will thank me for the course I have taken, if he marries Miss Granger. I have not told William my determination, nor shall I at present. I do not wish to give him an opportunity to speak to Emily alone. Under the impulse of the moment he might be betrayed into saying more than he really felt. I think he has a deeper interest in her, than he has been willing to acknowledge, but I wish to see it put to a test. Be- sides, Emily is so young and has been so little in society that she has had no advantage of choice. I wish her to see other men. She is lovely and will be admired. First love is a very sweet thing as the poets paint it, but it is a dream from which there follows a bitter awaking some- times-I must go home now and prepare for my journey. Good-by. So she left me thinking, and the result of my medita- tions was a feeling of disappointment, and half disap. proval. Why not give William an opportunity to declare himself if he wishes it? 4       ' *     4     . Mary and the children, with Emily, are gone, and the dear home shut up. It is refreshing to see Mr. Herbert three times a day, and to have an evening chat with him, but I miss Mary. She is my best friend here; she is the only one that fills the void of your living presence. Wil. liam Lynn did not know of their intention to leave till the day before they started. I was there when it wai     178    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; O, -  announced to him. He seemed astonished, puzzled- sorry-and I thought secretly unhappy about it. I think his interest in Emily partakes of somewhat that is tender, but I know nothing about it. What if he should be fascinated with Lucille for a while? It would not be strange. Men are so dazzled by beauty and vivacity- Emily's is a quiet, home-like loveliness that grows upon one. It would not take any heart by storm, but it would hold it captive when once gained. I must do my best to entertain the young people while Mary is away-but I have lost so much of my capacity for interesting the young, that I know they will miss their sympathizing friend who seemed more like one of them. I had not seen Lizzie for nearly a week, being myself indisposed and unable to go out, when one afternoon, as I was thinking about her, wondering why she had not been to see me, and trying to summon resolution to brave this cold, damp, penetrating atmosphere, my husband came in, and asked me if I was not well enough to run in and see her a little while, for he knew she was in trouble. In reply to my questions, he told me that Edward had been at home sick for several days, and in such a condi- tion that he required a man to take care of him. Deli- rium tremens! yes, it was nothing less. Poor Lizzie has been brought to the worst now. How will she bear it? I asked, and prepared immediately to go to her. My bon- net and cloak on, and my feet upon the threshold I hesitated. The thought suggested itself, perhaps she would rather not see me-rather that I should not see her shame and her disgrace. Her shame-yes, thus a wife feels in her husband's degradation. He feels no shame-but she-her innocent children-on them the burden lies. She had not been to see me, perhaps because   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF VEBRY-DAY PEOPLE. 179 she did not wish me to know her bitter trial. I did not know for a time what it was best to do--but I decided at length to go. My husband advised it. As I walked along, I had a vision of the past-of Edward and Lizzie as they were when I first saw them. He, so haggard and care-worn now, passed before me a curly-haired blue-eyed boy, beautiful as the morning. He was small and delicately formed-lithe and graceful, the very ideal of a poet-child. How his mother idolized him! Alas! her weak indulgence was his ruin. He became selfish and exacting-his temper was ungovern- able; what he wanted, were it ever so unreasonable, if it was in the bounds of possibility, he had. His brothers and sisters always gave up to him-his mother was ruled by his whims; and he was not an affectionate child. He felt no gratitude for the sacrifices that were made for him. What pampered child ever does  He received all as a matter of course-as his indisputable right. At school he won golden opinions on account of a certain kind of talent, a readiness of acquirement, and a gift of language. His compositions were remarkable for a boy of his age. As he grew to manhood, he man- ifested a strong ambition of literary distinction. iHe was a good scholar, a great reader, and had a faculty of appropriating the thoughts and the knowledge of others in a way calculated to deceive that class of minds which, puffed up with a conceit of their intellectual discernment, are ambitious to place their own rushight in the sun- shine of another's popularity, that they may shine with reflected lustre in their own little orbit, and thereby attain an importance in the literary world which, by their own force of character, they could never secure. Such cliques and clans may be found in every place.     ISO    TH OLD CORNER CUPBOARD OBn the hangers on of popular men and women; and such a circle revolved about Edward Cameron. His brothers and sisters, compelled by very limited means to self-exertion, for. the support of the family, were the slaves of his caprice and selfishness. They loved him, they idealized him-invested him with the mantle of genius-thought every line he wrote was true poetry-wondered at his knowledge, and were only too happy to let him have his own way-to work for him-. to save for him. They felt nothing a sacrifice which was done for him. At the age of twenty one, with nothing to live on but his reputation, he was engaged to Lizzie. You know all about this; more even than myself, as I was away at the time of their marriage, and heard of it first through you. But you did not know them personally as I did, for we were brought up side by side. Lizzie was a noble girl-full of enthusiasm, full of ardent and self-denying affection-full of talent and too generous herself to suspect any one of selfishness, much /-lees one who incarnated her ideal of a poet-soul. Hers was a nature of strong contrasts-an intense, impassioned nature. If she loved at all, it must be with her whole soul, there could be no middle ground with her between like and dislike-I will not say love and hate, for hate is a strong word to apply to a woman's feelings. Few women hate. When a being once ardently loved ceases to inspire affection, the opposite feeling is not hatred, but an inward shrinking from-a dread-a loathing, more difficult to conceal and harder to endure than a sharp, decided hatred. But how much must she endurel what strivings with her old feelings of tenderness, what yearn. ingfor the sweet dreams that beguiled her, what self.   THE EVRTY-DAt   01C  EV BEoIe-DAT VOPL. 181 reproaches, what self-renunciation will she not undergo before she stands face to face with the naked, appalling fact that love is dead and buried in her heart! Has Lizzie reached that point? Oh no, I think not. I have seen her look at him with so much tenderness. "None are all evil,"-selfish, debased as he is, he must have his better moments, and then her heart returns-I know it must, again and again to the hopes, the love of the past-of her maidenhood. Delirium tremens! I said over and over to myself. And has it come to this? Fallen so low! that fine intellect, that capacity for the highest excellence! My heart was sad enough when I reached their door, but I was glad I went. I will write you again soon. I know you will be anxious to hear again from the Camerons, and I will take up the thread where I laid it down, a few days ago. I told you I was glad I went- and Lizzie was glad to see me. She was so forlorn, had suffered so much, and was so wrought up by the painful excitement she had endured, that I know nothing would relieve her so much, as to unburden her sorrow to a friendly heart-to one who would not abuse her confidence. Besides, she knew I must be aware of the facts-of her husband's present condition, and of his previous habits. "I shielded him, I hid my own sorrow from all eyes, even from my mother's as long as I could," said she, "but he has betrayed himself. I have no more hope for him-for myself-for my poor children. While I thought the world did not know it, it was easier to bear the loA l Much as I longed for sympathy, for advice, I could not-- would not ask it, for his sake. I thought, there is yet hope for him, if he does not lose his self-respect, if he does not feel that his reputation is gone. I persuaded . ,     182    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; Ol, him to come here, thinking that if our outward prospects were more favorable, it would be an encouragement to him-that he would be happier. I felt that, harassed by so many pecuniary anxieties, mortified by want of success, so many of us dependent upon him-his pride making him unwilling that I should exert myself in aid of his efforts for the support of the family-with a feeble phy- sical organization and great nervous susceptibility, it was no wonder that he should seek to drown his misery in forgetfulness. I wanted to help him. I thought I could do it here, where nobody knew us, without wound- ing his pride. My plan seemed at first to succeed. I had begun once more to be hopeful. But now-," and she wrung my hands as she spoke-" now it is all over. There is no more hope for me. Everybody knows it now. He has lost his situation. The whole world must know now, our degradation, our misery." What she said was true. What could I say to her? Everybody did know it--had known it longer than she imagined. I told her she must not dwell upon that thought-must not allow herself to be crushed-must not give up hope-must not in short look beyond the present. Bitter as it was, its bitterness was a thousand fold augmented by vague apprehensions. I told her-a trite saying to be sure, but if spoken at the right moment, one ull of comfort and strength-that no trial was so terrible in its reality as when looked upon from'a distance-and that the good God who permitted us to be afflicted, would give us strength to bear our load if we asked it in faith. Everything I said to her was common- place-an old story often repeated, but suited to our common wants-our common nature. While we were talking together the door of his chamber opened and I heard his ravings--"Let me go home!" he   THEE BVRY'DAY'fltE OF: EBVY-DAY 'PEOPLE. .13 said, in such a voice as made me shudder-"Take me home gentlemen, home!" Lizzie turned as pale as death and would haverushed to him had I not detained her. She sank back in my arms-Oh, how she has loved him  As I looked at her poor, distracted countenance so full of anguish, my heart sank within me. What could I say to her, to lift up her soul to the only Comforter The weight of her affliction seemed as if it were crushing me also-and the future seemed to me terrible in its blackness of darkness. How cold my words sounded, you can perhaps understand, for you may have been placed in a position calling for great thoughts, and inspiring hopes, when you were unable to see anything but the dark side of the picture. Yet I longed to lift her up-to help her. As the surest help I encouraged her to unbosom herself. I felt there was such a relief in speaking out one's misery. So putting my arm around her, I led her to a seat beside me: "Lizzie, dear child, you know I am your friend-trust me-I may not be able to help you, and yet I may, for I have reached a point in time, when the trials of this life fade away in comparison with the hopes of another. I know the bitterness of your sorrow. Yours is not an isolated experience. I had a dear friend years ago, whose domestic life was clouded as yours is. Long and fearful was the conflict, for her nature was proud and haughty. She loved to idolatry. The contest was for some time doubtful, but God is on the side of virtue. She learned on whom to rely-she conquered-she rose above her trials, she found peace." I saw the cloud lifted up that had shrouded Lizzie's face when I began speaking. This gleam of encouragement enabled me to go on. "Your dear little children look to you for good, Lizzie. You must be for them-wisdom and- love-father and mother.     184    TBS OW COEmEa OClfLOArn; a0, The Lord has placed you in a situation where your- present duty is plain. Do not look beyond it now. Receive your daily bread, moistened though it is by tears, and leave results to Him who appoints the lot of all his children. Accept the present, "And that so bitter!" exclaimed Lizzie, "How can I? Is there then, do you think, no ground for hope?" "There is this ground for hope always, my dear child. If we live wisely-itn the present-trueting our happines with God, we shall find peace at last." "But I cannot give him up," she gasped wildly. "I think of him as he was when I knew him first and loved him so well. I look upon hi{ children--I think of the awful possibilities of their future, and I feel that I must save him for their sakes as well as his own- that there is a way, if I only knew it, to reach his heart-to arouse his conscience-to rekindle his affections. Do you think there is no hope?" "What we cannot do ourselves for our loved ones, God can do for us," said I. "Hope in Him." "I am not a Christian," said Lizzie; "I am afraid I do not know what trust in God really means. I know what it is to be cut off from all human help-to feel alone- alone in the wide world-alone in soul-the joy of youth gone-health, energy, hope, all gone, but from these depths my soul cannot rise to what you call trust in God. I wish it could. I have suffered much," she continued after a pause, "God only knows how much. But I do not think I have been made better by it. I have tried to harden myself-tried not to feel. When my heart has been breaking, and my poor children clung tremblig th me, afraid of his violence, I have for their sakes assumed indifferencz-coldness, that their young hearts need not ach4 for my suffering.

I have reasoned with my- self, repeating over and over again, 'It is not he, but the demon that possesses him that is rooting up all our household joys.' But I cannot steel myself against my misery. Oh if you knew what maddening thoughts, what wicked, wicked thoughts I have had sometimes - but I will not repeat them. They do not last. They were wrung from me in an unguarded moment. At the bottom of my heart, I feel how much more he is to be pitied than I am, or even than his poor children. How much deeper the injuries he inflicts upon himself, than upon us. This is a terrible thought. When I think of it, I forgive him all. But I will not talk any more about myself. Perhaps I have done wrong, but I could not help it. Do not distress yourself about us. It was a relief to talk to you, and I thank you for listening." "You need not thank me," said I, "and I wish I could do you good. I will not preach patience to you now while your heart is distracted with anxiety and grief-yet she is a gentle friend, a very angel of peace to the soul, Lizzie, and does not fly from those who seek her." I will give you some advice-you will think it com- mon-place enough, but it may help you, as it has helped me in past trials. You do not believe that anything happens by chance-whether of joy or sorrow. You believe in a good God, a merciful Father. All we can do is to accept our lot, and use its trials in the best way we can. They were not sent to crush us-and we are not left to struggle alone with misfortune. Try to see the hand outstretched to save you. Be patient-be as cheerful as you can. Do not aggravate present evils by dreary apprehensions. Do not ask what you shall do by-and-by, or how you will be able to bear the evils that 16     186    T  OLD O ORMNE CUPBOARD; OR, may be stored up for you in the future. Strive only to bear those of to-day in the best way you can-and thus your strength, and patience, and trust in God will increase. Aid above all things try, for your' children's sake, to be hopeful-not only to assume cheerfulness, but to be cheerful. It will not always be striving. By-and-by it will become a reality." "Oh, if I thought so," said Lizzie sadly-" but I am not good. The dreams of youth still linger with me. How I have longed for happiness I And must I give up the vision, and strive only for resignation and patience I Is there no such thing in life as joy? Did God give me this thirst of the soul for naught? Often when I have been like one wandering in the desert, I have heard soft murmurs in the distance as of clear waters, on whose banks I hoped to find yet the happiness for which I pine. Oh, the cool brooks among my native hills! I remember the time I used to wander beside them and lie for hours on their green banks, sending my thoughts on and on toward a future, all bright and full of hope. But what is that future now? Dry, desolate, barren of verdure, and yet I still dream on-the thirst of my soul still unslaked." "There is but one fountain that quenches the soul's thirst, Lizzie," said I. "I have heard that before," she replied, "often and often-said it over and over to myself, and it is strange that I should not have found it yet. But so it is-I see others happy around me, married people who love each other-old people whose children have grown up around them gentle, good and affectionate-and my heart sinks within me. Such a home can never be mine-never- never." I could not bear to hear her go on in that way-l felt how natural her grief was. I could not blame her.   THE EVERY-DAY IE i OFr RvY-DAY MEOPI.  18s I knew the-calmer, better thoughts would succeed, and I left her with that hope. In the evening Mr. Herbert called and offered to watch with Edward. The presence of a sympathizing friend was a solace to her. She dares not even enter her hus- band's room. The sight of her, or of the children excites him so much. I do not think Edward will recover. Last evening Rosalie, Lucille and William, passed with me. They came sociably to tea. I was very glad to see them, for my heart was so heavy with thinking of my poor friends the Camerons, that I had not power to see "the forms of things with an unclouded eye." The presence of these young, hopeful and happy people drew me involuntarily out of myself. Lucille was unusually brilliant, and it was evident to me that she was not indifferent to William's opinion of her. He is so non- committal when he chooses to be, that on4 may as well be blind, as try to penetrate through his cloak of re- serve. I wondered if he was captivated, and I might have continued to wonder, for all the light he chose to give me. I do not like Lucille better on acquaintance. She is too foreign, and I may add confidentially to you, too affected. She is accomplished, but very super- ficial. She is a thoroughly external person. You cannot be in her society long without perceiving that her enthu- siasm begins and ends, and is bounded entirely by mere words. She knows how to talk about art, and nature-- uses the most appropriate phrases, manifests a deal of en- thusiasm, too intensified and toogarrulous to be ral, and has so well conned the part she is to play that a casual observer might think it all genuine. I cannot think I am deceived in her. She has not a spark of genius. She has very little depth of character, and what she might have had is     188    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; on, lost in this superficial and worldly education. (Impression No. 2.) It is evident that Rosalie admires her exceed- ingly-thinks she is all she seems to be-'and has set her heart on having her for a sister. Poor little Emily! She is worth a dozen Lucilles-she is so true, so genuine. Has not William discernment enough to perceive this, or will he be dazzled by this external glitter? And Lucille does not like America, has no sympathy with republi- canism-no hallowed association with the place of her birth-thinks there is no place like Palis. This is not surprising to be sure, as all her childhood she was sur- rounded by a foreign atmosphere. It was a great mistake, if her father intended to make America his home, to educate his children abroad. But that is not my affair. William is a true patriot. He must not marry Lucille. Only once during the evening did he speak of Emily, expressing surprise, and I thought chagrin at Mary's leaving so abruptly. He particularly regretted, he said, that they were to be absent so long, as he thought he might join an expedition to the Rocky Mountains in the spring, which several young men of his acquaintance had joined, under the command of Captain Grey of the army. I told him, that to a young man of his abundant leisure and resources, a journey to New England was no great thing, and I thought the sight of good friends might repay him for the trouble; to which he replied, he was by no means certain that a visit from him would be acceptable, as they had not admitted him into a knowledge of their plans, or intimated that it would be agreeable to them to see him. Whereupon I reproved him for want of faith in old and tried friends, and changed the subject. I don't know as William would confide in me or in any one. I think I had rather he would not; but I hope he loves Emily.   THE BVERY-DAY USE OF VEBRY-DAY PEOPLE.  189 You inquire about my health, and wonder why I never speak of my bodily condition. The answer is simple. I do not care to think of it. I know my disease is becom- ing more and more deeply seated; my cough troubles me more; my flesh is wasting, and I am losing strength- but I suffer no pain. I do not mean to give up till I am compelled to, and I trust my heavenly Father will sum- mon me home as soon as I cease to be of use here. A sudden death has something in it delightful to me. I remember when it wore a very different aspect. I cannot say that I hope to die suddenly, but it is a pleasant thought, and I feel almost a presentiment that I shall pass away suddenly at the last. It is only in fearing and dreading death that we can be said to die. I have passed through that agony, and really feel-it is not mere words-but I really feel that there is no death to those who believe in God. Yet, mortal life is sweet. The world is dear to me-my friends are very precious-and the earth is full of beauty. I love it-yes I love life-- I find in it so much that is good and great-so much poe- try-so much inspiration. Life is full of meaning--human- ity full of interest. I do not think that what we call death can destroy this union of mind with mind-spirit with spirit-this yearning of soul and sense with the beautiful and true. Last evening, fMr. Herbert came in with the intelli- gence that Edward was much worse, and he thought he could not survive the night. My husband suggested that I had better not go, fearing the effect of strong excitement upon me; but I knew my own strength, and went. I am glad that I did. Poor Edward is gone. He died about midnight. We were all with him; none but friends stood- around his bedside-the two eldest children, with their     190    WE O  a CoNB CUPBOARD; OR, mother, Mr. Herbert, my husband and myself. I was glad Lizzie was able to control herself. Poor child  How his faults faded away in the presence of death. She had loved him from her childhood with a true, fervent de- votion. He had planted thorns along the path they had trodden together, but she forgave him all at that hour,  She saw him, not as he had been through these long, weary years of suffering, but as he was when she first promised to share life's vicissitudes with him-her first and only love. And she has been faithful. I am sure, in the records of that Book of Life from which her final judg- ment is to come, she will not be found wanting. Yes, she loved him to the last. It may be that when her heart S/cwas bleeding through his unkindness, thoughts arose in her mind which her better nature could not stifle in a moment, but she cherished no resentment. And if now, in her hour of grief;, they return to haunt her, we must teach her to be charitable to herself. I wish you had been with us, and yet it was too sad. You might have sug- gested thoughts of comfort that I could not. Poor Ed. ward I what was passing in his mind no eye but God can know. A wasted life is the record he leaves with us. Powers misapplied, affections turned inward upon himself, health ruined, happiness wrecked, usefulness destroyed. God have mercy on him and on us all! Who does not feel the need of this prayer? Long after he was unable to articulate above a whisper, his eye was fixed upon Lizzie and his children. She held his hand to the last. She went with him to that boundary which the mortal could not pass, and still she clung to him. Those eyes upturned were gazing upon her with such a depth of meaning. There was no shadow of un- consciousness upon them at the last moment. The chil- dren stooped to kin his brow; great tears gathered in his   THE EVERY-DAY i-FE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 191 eyes, and rolled down his cheeks. His lips moved: we thought he asked for water, and as Lizzie bent over him, he murmured, "faithful to death." It was of Her he spoke, of his faithful, long-suffering wife. They were his last words, but the feeling that inspired them lingered still in his glazing eye. Such siletce followed-the silence of death. Her hand still clasped in his, her head bowed upon the pillow beside him, and the spirit had passed away while we were standing there, yet we, shrouded in mortality, had not heard the fluttering of its wings. I drew Lizzie from the bedside. "It is all over now," said I; c" think of your children." "Oh, had I been more faithful," said she, bitterly. "Every impatient word, every unkind thought comes back to me now. Yet I tried to do my duty. I never ceased to love him. But I dwelt so much upon my un- happiness-my disappointed hopes-of the wrong he did me and his children. Oh t I can never forgive myself." I knew she saw everything through the medium of her own excited feelings, and- that she would be calmer soon. I wish to ask you a question I have often asked myself. How much can one human being do toward saving ano- ther from sin and its consequences? Must we understand literally the stern decree that every soul must "work out its own salvation?"Can we not help one another more than we do, and how can we do it? When the conscious- ness of the love of wife and children, the endearments of home, the convictions of duty, the sight of misery which he has brought upon those whom it was his duty to pro- tect, stares him in the face, and yet the inebriate plunges deeper and- deeper in self-indulgence, what can mortal help avail I  I confess it is a form of misery and sin to me the most hopeless that can fall upon our human race. If one could     192    TEM OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, not look to the Lord in trust, from whence could strength and patience be found? I look upon it as a blessing to all his family, and to himself, that poor Edward is removed. I have felt and spoken bitterly of him, for which I reproach myself, and yet all I have said was true. Perhaps much more might have been said in palliation of his errors equally true. God knows. He is gone. That erring, tried and tempted soul was not forgotten of God. All that Infinite love and wisdom could do for him has been done and will be done for him. *    *    *    -^   * What you tell me of Emily is really distressing. Lame for life! a hopeless invalid! I am grieved beyond expres- sion. The Doctor thinks her spine is injured. But will not perfect rest and freedom from anxiety restore her  And they may be obliged to remain there a year! Well, I must see them there, then. William tells me he has written to Mary of his intention to go West. He looks wretchedly. I asked him why he did not go to New En- gland before he started on his expedition. He pleaded want of time. I am quite sure he is not in love with Lucille, although Rosalie hinted to me the other daythat she thought her friend might decide not to return to Eu- rope. They had planned a summer ramble to the Lakes, she said, accompanied by William. I mentioned it to Mr. Lynn as something delightful in prospective, to which he replied, that Rosalie always had great schemes for fu- ture enjoyment, and that he let her run on in her own fashion, without taking the trouble even to suggest any possibilities, for he thought it was as innocent a recreation as any other, and it seemed to make very little difference with her whether her plans were fulfilled or not. "But," said I, "what is to hinder you from accompa- nying the girls if they wish it?"   THE VEYItYDAY LIFE OF EBEVPRY-DA PEOPLE. 193 "A thousand things," he replied, "and one in a thou- sand might determine the matter, and that a very selfish objection. I have no taste for roaming about the country with two young ladies in search of amusement. I have played oarpet-knight long enough" "So you are going to rough it among the Indians," said I, "and perhaps you will settle dowa with some pretty squaw in the wilderness." "I don't think it unlikely," he replied; "I should in- finitely prefer it to your excessive civilization. What is more utterly weak and foolish-I ask yofu eWriouly.-what is more unsatisfactory than oue of your modern fashiona- ble young ladies I am not speaking of Rosalie-she is a good creature at heart, and too simple in her tastes to aspire to be a leader of the ton-a riodern belle. But how is it with those flocks of girls who constitute society? Splendid creature, as I heard a young man say the other day at Mrs. Bristol's ball. I confess I was so bored that I could not stay out half the evening. The truth is, Mrs. Dearbon," said he, seriously, "I have not yet found what you told me once I should find, that it was a good thing to have lived and suffered. I am destitute of ambition and energy; I have no object in life; and as to my principles, 1 have no confidence in them to withstand temptation.

These ties are very strongly rooted in my nature, and if Mabel had lived, I feel that I should have been a better man. The necessity of exertion would have made me strong. The object would have been all-sufficient, and we should have been happy. As it is, I have an unsettled feeling, and I must work or walk it off. "But why do you not seek to make a home for your affections " said I. "I may have had such dreams once, but they are dissipated," he said sadly; "I cannot be satisfied with anything short of love." "And who is more favorably situated than you are for choice?"I asked. "I think you undervalue your own advantages." "You are mistaken. Without doubt, if I seriously set about finding a wife, I might succeed. Money will buy some women. I don't mention that as an objection. I do not wonder that it should be a weighty consideration in this age of ridiculous rivalries and affectations. A woman ought to have some panacea for a marriage without heart. But you know me so well, as to know that such a marriage would not suit me. You know too that the woman of my choice, such an one as I could love, would do a very unwise thing, and one which sensible parents and guardians would have a right to object to, if she gave herself away to a man who had no steadiness of purpose-no aim or object in life-no fixedness of character-no guarantee in himself that he could make her permanently happy. My eyes are quite open, I assure you. Circumstances have held me up to my own inspec- tion, and I see, a woman would run a great risk, who married me expecting to be really happy. A man must do something, and keep his faculties alive, in exercise, or he will rust out, heart and mind. A mere idler, a   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 195 dreamer-a man of leisure and taste-is not the sort to make a rational woman happy, because he must needs be a selfish man-or generous only by instinct. My case is a hard one, and with all your good sense you cannot advise me, because I know even now, a thousandfold better than I do. My mind is made up on this expedi- tion. If I live to come back, I shall be better or worse- I shall at any-rate be something." A tormenting little spirit whispered in my ear-Do give some hint-say something, if it is only Lucille. Do find out at least what he thinks of her. No matter about Emily-that subject is too sacred-but do start some- thing. "So you leave Rosalie, and her friend, without a protector. Isn't that running away from the duty that lies nearest you," I asked, bolting the question in a very awkward way I confess. "They are fully able to protect themselves. If there is any lack, it is on Rosalie's part, and Miss Granger can easily supply that deficiency." Why would he not come to the point? Ask him at once, whispered the little spirit, at my ear. It is not impudence in an old friend, such as you are. So I yielded. ' William," said I, "I have beat about the bush long enough, and now I am coming to the point. We have thought-Mary and myself-in short all of us have thought, you were a great admirer of Lucille, and I con- fess I am rather surprised (I could not say disappointed) that you can so easily make up your mind to leave her for the Rocky Mountains, or for a moment set beside her in your imagination, a squaw of the Sioux, or Ohippewa tribe of Indians." "If you and Mrs. Herbert, and all, could so misunder- stand me, there is so much the more need of my going," said he. "I thought you knew me better. This only     196    THE OLD COtN COUPBOARD; OR, proves that what I said before is true. I must be strangely wanting in character, if the six years or more acquaint- ance you have all had with me, has left no more definite impression of myself than that. It is a mortifying con- elusion I assure you." "Now  you seem a little vexed, William," said I, "which is very unreasonable. You may as well make up your mind to bear a little catechizing sometimes from an old friend, and pardon a little curiosity in a woman. What could be more natural, than that you should be captivated by a beautiful and gifted young girl, a friend of your sister's, with whom you were daily thrown in the most familiar relation? There may be, it is true, some- thing peculiar in your character or circumstances, of which I am ignorant, which renders you proof against the usual tendencies of such juxtaposition, but you cannot expect me to be wise above what is written, or to know more than you choose to tell me. Therefore I judge you by the customary standard. Young, susceptible, affec- tionate-a lover of domestic life-keenly alive to the beautiful, and ready to surrender-" "At discretion?" added William laughing, yet looking withal a good deal annoyed. "In some respects you are right, and in others quite wrong. Young but not suscep- tible-affectionate, but not very demonstrative-a lover of domestic life, and consequently fearful of risking my all on a short acquaintance-keenly alive to beauty, and for that reason very much afraid of being dazzled by it, at the expense of my better reason." "A very Daniel come to judgment," said I. "Why, your caution amazes me." He looked quite vexed, but nothing would do. lie did not tell me what I wished to know, so I thought I would try another dodge. "If I live until next spring," said   THE EVERY-DAT LnF OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 197 I, " and am as well as I hope to be, I intend to make a visit to New England. How pleasant it would be, if you are determined not to go to the lakes, if you could induce Rosalie and Lucille to pass a few weeks in com- pany with Mary and her family, myself and mine at the sea-shore. But I suppose the Rocky Mountains have greater attractions for you. There is something firmer even than long tried friendship I " And what is hatat " he asked. "The everlasting hills," I replied, "towards which you look with so much eagerness. Now, one would think we had stronger claim upon you than the Chippewas, Sioux, or any other tribes of Indians, but if you will go West, why not determine to come back in the summer, and join our party? After a fair trial of both extremes, if you decide that a life in the woods is better than civilization, we will relinquish you without a murmur, because, joking aside, dear William, we love you too well to wish to change your purposes merely to gratify ourselves. I will not insist upon your falling in love with Lucille, or anybody else, but I do desire to have you of our party next summer." "Then I promise to join you some time in September, provided a pretty squaw does not hold me prisoner, or a blood-thirsty old chief takes a notion to have my scalp for a trophy. If I live, I will join your party. But you must promise to secure me a welcome from each indi- vidual." "I can do this unreservedly," said I. "Without a single exception 2 " "Not one," I replied. "Then you have my word, here is my hand, and fare-  well for the present; "-and the provoking fellow left me just where I was in the beginning of our interview, only     198    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, a little more persuaded in my own mind that he was not in love with Lucille. Am I glad to believe this or ought I to be? Suppose Lucille loves him-ought I not to desire her happiness as much as Emily's? But she will not be unhappy. Her pride may be wounded, her vanity mortified, but she will not long be unhappy. That she is, or fancies she is, in love with him, I do not doubt, and am not in the least surprised at it. But she could never make him happy, and he could never satisfy her worldly ambition. There- fore, as a wise looker-on, I hope such an alliance will never take place; and since he will not go to New England now, and Emily is not here, I am glad he is going to the Rocky Mountains. Rosahe was here yesterday, quite sad and out of spirits. Poor girl! William leaves next week for New Orleans, from whence the exploring party set out in the early spring. A widowed sister of her father's, with two young daughters, are to arrive in a few days. It was an arrange- ment made before Mr. Lynn's death, that when the son of this sister entered college, the mother and two girls should make their home at his house. Rosalie has never seen her aunt or any member of the family. She dreads their coming, and the additional care it will involve. But as William is not to be at home, and his father fore- saw the possibility of Rosalie being left without a pro- tector, it was I think, a wise arrangement, provided they are good and agreeable people. Rose will of course be the head of the family. It was William's departure that vexed her most. "I never have any comfort in him," said she, " though he is always kind and brotherly. He will not do as I wish to have him. Anybody would have thought it very natural that he should have fallen in love   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 199 with Lucille, and I hoped he would. It would have been so pleasant to me to have had her for a sister-and she would have made him a splendid wife, she is so hand- some and stylish, and really so good-hearted; but he is so set in his way, just for all the world like Mr. Rochester." He has never liked Lucille since a little conversation we had about the lower classes, in which she said some foolish things about God's having made them inferior on purpose to be servants and slaves to the rich; and after that he overheard her speaking very harshy to a sewing- girl about a dress she had promised to finish at a certain time, and failed to do so, because her mother had been sick and she was obliged to nurse her. I confess, I was sorry myself to hear her talk, and the poor girl shed tears. But, it is Rosalie's way, or rather the way in which she has been educated, and she would become more thoughtful under William's teaching, and with his good ex,--r-e always before her. I was so unhappy, Mrs. Dearbon, to have such a thing happen just now. William had admired Lucille before- at least when she first came he seemed quite fascinated, but this last misfortune has cut off all hope. He followed the sewing-girl to the door, and has since been to see her family. I know Lucille is ashamed of herself, and did not mean to be hard-hearted; but it is done now and can't be helped-William is determined to go. "But, my dear Rose, you would not wish your brother to marry for the sake of giving you a sister you desired, particularly if he did not affect the lady? I am sorry for your part of the disappointment, yet I don't see how we can help it." "But I really think, Lucille loves William," she con- tinued; " and if he only knew it, she could be moulded to anything by the man she loved."     200    TR OLD CODRN  CUPBOARD; OR, "But perhaps William would prefer some one whose character was already moulded I My dear, we cannot settle these matters for our friends, and it is not worth while to make ourselves uneasy about them." (Give me credit for trying to apply this good advice to my own state of feel- ing with regard to Emily. ) After all, what avails trying to make matches for our friends? Perhaps if mortals did not busy themselves so much in these matters, we might have more matches made in heaven. You are so anxious to hear more of Lizzie, that I wish I could write longer letters. I see her nearly every day, and if I could, should like to send you my spiritual diary, for I have no strength to put my meditations on paper. She interests me much, but I can do her very little good except by my sympathy. She has a strong nature, and intense feelings. I can understand how much she has suf- fered in her married life, not only from the sad habit to which her husband was addicted, but from his selfish and exacting nature. When the illusion of her blind idolatry dropped off, and the romance of youth had vanished, the stern conflict of life began. Even then, however, had he been possessed of a warm, generous heart, she might have been happy.  Doubtless she thinks now, it was her fault that she could not be so. I question whether it is possible for a true woman to love what she cannot respect. I do not speak of that divine pity which may exist in the breast of a Christian. With regard to mere natural rela- tions I ask myself, can a woman of refined taste and cul- ture-of high aspirations and longings after a better life- love what is low, groveling, unlovely? And does not the nearness of the relation make only the more painfully obvious the gulf which separates them spiritually? Yet she upbraids herself; and every impatient word she has   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVEBY-DAY PEOPLE. 201 uttered-every bitter thought she has indulged-comes back now to haunt her. She blames herself for his ruin. She thinks she might have done more to save him. By. and-by she will come to a healthier state of mind and be able to judge herself more truly. She has done all she could with the light she had. Alas! we must make our- selves more perfect, if we would elevate others, or rather, we must say, "Not my will, but thine." We must look above for the help we cannot give even to those we would die to save. Lizzie's baby is pining, and I think will soon pass away. The attention she is compelled to bestow upon it withdraws her mind from herself. Her brother has written to her to return, and he offers her a home. He is a bachelor, and well able to support her; but I think she prefers remaining independent. I approve of her desire to earn her own living, for action is neces- sary to the soul's health at all times, but particularly to the sick soul. I feel sure Lizzie will come out bright and strong, and she has yet before her the happiest part of life, As soon as she is able, I intend to ask her to teach my childrenj with her own. I have no doubt that this small beginning will be an opening for something better, when she comes to be known. The winter is passing rapidly. How swift the wheel revolves on the down hill of life! Another season of frost and snow will not find me here. I speak with the spirit of prophecy. A vision comes over me, of two graves in a village church-yard far away. There where my mother and my first-born are laid, shall this worn-out body rest also.; But before that time I shall revisit the spot with my children.  A s soon as the spring opens, I shall set my house in order, and when the summer days, with their long, bright sunny hours are come, I shall go to my old     202    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, home--to die among my old friends, and to be buried in the graveyard of my native village. I shall be buried-no! no! -you know I do not mean this-I do not feel it for an instant-I do not feel it for myself, any more than for them. They are not there-they are risen. And from the spot where their mortal remains are laid, my soul- your soul-and the souls of my beloved ones who remain behind me-forgetting all grief, which is of time, strive up- ward to the eternal. I have often wished to speak more particularly to you of my dear children. I want you to know them-to love them. I have thought I would tell you somewhat of their characters and dispositions; but I am afraid that, once upon a theme so full of interest to me, I might not know when to stop. You shall see them and judge for yourself. I know your heart inclines to love them, for the sake of their mother. I think when you come to know them, they will be dear to you for their own sake. They are neither of them geniuses. They will never te distinguished in the world. This is a source of com- fort to me. The path of an ambitious woman of genius is beset with so many temptations and dangers. They are not strikingly handsome. I confess that, to their mother's eye, they are more than well looking-particu- larly the youngest-through whose blue eyes the soul of my angel boy seems to- shine. They are affectionate, obedient, conscientious--not wanting in the gayety and sprightliness of youth-and yet capable of serious reflec- tion. They will, I think, be good and loving wives and mothers, if they fulfill their destiny. I have learned not to look upon them as mine, but as God's children. According to the natural course of events in life, they would in a few years, probably, leave mine, for another's home. They would not even then belong to   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 203 me, and my selfish love would suffer in the separation, were I here to feel it. I am not so necessary to them as my maternal instincts might tempt me to believe-at any- rate, I may safely leave themn with God, This, in my best moments, I am cheerfully resigned to do; but these best moments do not make up the sum of mortal life. My fears, my anxieties, nmy hopes-these I will tell you when we meet-I cannot write them. William comes here daily. He inquires with much ten- derness after Emily, and seems shocked and distressed at her accident. Sometimes I think he is tempted to go and bid them good-by, before he sets out on his expedition, but I fear he will not. I know' he hears from Mary often. He has shown me some of her letters. They are kind, affectionate, friendly and cheerful, but contain very little about Emily. I think he is under the impression, that although Mary is very much interested in his welfare, and attached to him personally, she does not think him worthy of Emily; and that, perceiving his growing inter- est in her, she removed her, that it might be suffered to die away. These are my conjectures, and if they are true, of course I can do nothing to make matters right, as he does not confide in me, nor give me an opportunity to offer him a word of encouragement. And perhaps this is best. Rosalie's relations have arrived. She likes them better than she expected. Her aunt is a sensible, rational, cheerful, kindly woman. The two girls pretty, and well behaved. I think, now that she has some one to matro- nize her, she will go more into society, and have more company at her own house. Gay people, music and dan- cing, with a seasoning of admiration, will soon reconcile Lucille to her disappointment, if she had any hope of securing the affections of William Lynn; andi, although   ,                   i     -- A*,U uuvmN'J   OUPBOARD; OR, Rosalie may not so soon forget it, she will easily be led to rejoice in her brother's happiness, whenever she is assured of it. But he looks so miserably dejected, it worries her and all of us. He went last week to see his little boy. The old grand-parents still live, but are quite infirm. They have a nice, motherly woman to assist them in the care of the child. I should love to have a visit from Willie; but William says, he has not the heart to take him from the old people. It will be nine years in May, since William first met Mabel, when he was a boy of eighteen at college. Six years the same month, since they were married, and five years since she died. Before leaving home he tells me he shall make his will. I wish he would not go. I have a terribly sad feeling about it- not quite amounting to a presentiment-but a forebod- ing of evil, and I wish he would not go, at any-rate not before seeing Emily once more. Mary writes me she is sweetly patient and cheerful. I am glad of it, and yet, if she loved him as well as I hoped and believed, could she be so under the circumstances! Perhaps she knows the state of his heart better than any of us. Slight things may reveal so much in certain relations. He' may have given her a token, by word or look, or the pressure of the hand. How could our grosser senses have perceived it! Unless it be so, I cannot account for her being so cheer- ful. She sits up and walks a little, with assistance. Well well! all will be right. Bless the good old soul who taught me this. "All will be right in the ages." You have learned toexpect long and frequent gaps in our correspondence, my friend, and to believe that its spirit cannot be interrupted. The winter is nearly gone, and already my longing eyes anticipate the budding beauty of the spring: although it will be the last spring which greets   THE EVRSY-DA T L  OF EBRY-DAY PEOPLE. 205 me here. I am not impatient of its delay, for I have enjoyed much this winter, of a nature more allied to heavenly blessedness than any feeling I have ever known. I suffer so little, that, except for this weakness and wasting of my frame, I should need to be reminded of the goal to which I am hastening. My children have been an inex- pressible comfort to me this winter, and in the absence of other friends, I have enjoyed all the more, communion with their fresh, young hearts. My husband is unusually occupied with business, in consequence of the absence of his partner. We both lament, inwardly, that we can be so little together; but eternity is long, and the years that will separate us, short. I have not had a sad day - you may think it strange-and perhaps it is accounted for by the nature of my disease. I have heard that consumptives were always cheerful and hopeful in their decline. The good God provides for all his children, the compensation we require. You ask, If I speak to my children of the probable termination of my disease, and try to prepare them for our separation? My dear, I say nothing about it at present, for the reason, that I have always believed it unwise and unnecessary to hold up before the mind the end of mortal life, in order to be prepared to meet it as Christians. If we learn how to live, and we only do this by living well in the present hour, we are prepared to meet death at any time. If we do not thus live, the spectre of death, constantly held up to our view, will not prepare us. For it is not death, but life to which we are destined. Let us merge, if we can, our physical shrinking from the dissolution of the body, in the certainty of immortal life. So, too, with the trials and afflictions that may await us,- we only prepare ourselves to meet them by accepting daily and hourly, and using wisely, the discipline God appoints.     206    THE OLD OORNEB CUPBOARD; ORB This is being nourished by " our daily bread." This is all we need. We cannot lay up stores for future use. We must grow strong spiritually, in the same way as we do physically,- by receiving and assimilating that portion of nourishment daily and hourly, which God suits to our needs. My children may know that I must soon be taken from them, because I have made for, and with them, many necessary arrangements, or what seem so to me; but I am very careful never to speak with sadness, even if I feel it; which I should be more than human -perhaps more than angelic-if I did not, sometimes. I have seen very little of Rosalie of late. As I predicted, they are having a gay time. Lucille is quite a belle, and being beautiful and rich, of course has many admirers. Rosalie, too, is considered more than ordinarily attractive. She is still enthusiastic in praise of her friend, and not a whit envious. Rosalie is a good girl, pliant, easily influ- enced but conscientious. I hope she will marry a strong, earnest and high-principled man. She is gentle and affectionate, but needs a stronger arm to lean upon. I shall always feel an interest in her. Mary's return will be a happy circumstance to her, for she is very fond of Mary, and willing to be directed by her. I think she looks upon mine as rather ghostly counsel. Perhaps I am too serious, but I do not wish to seem to reprove mirth and innocent gayety. Dear child! Death to her is a ghastly spectre who, with icy hand, plucks the roses of life and scatters their sweetness to the winds. She cannot see how he transplants them tenderly to the "Everlasting Gardens," where they become immortal. William wrote to me once from New Orleans. If he had spoken, before he went, in the same strain in which   THE: EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY DAY PEOPLE. 207 he writes, I think I could have said something to raise his spirits and inspire him -with hope, perhaps to have changed his determination; but now it is impossible. He was to leave in a few days on his wild and silly expedi- tion, and I do not know how a letter would reach him. But autumn is not very far distant, and then he has pro- mised to return. I rejoice that you have seen Mary and her children, and dear Emily; and so glad that you love them all, particu- larly our child -for she seems in a measure to be mine. I certainly feel a mother's tenderness for her. So her cheerfulness is a matter of wonder to both yourself and Mary. It only proves to me that love and hope seldom are divided in the young heart. Mary never questions her of her feelings towards William, you say, but takes for granted, that they are friendly and sisterly. That is all right, but I could not be so wise and cautious. If I did not ask any questions, I am quite sure I should-say something pointed enough to make an impression, and read an answer in her speaking face. I suppose, if I were to live twice my present number of years, I could never get the better of a sort of impatience to see the end of things--anticipating results in a very childish manner. And then you know, I always prided myself on a certain discriminating genius I had, a quick perception in these matters-call it intuition-and I have seldom found my- self very much at fault. I will not close without a word of Lizzie. I wrote you of the dear baby's death. It was not unexpected. It passed away like a flower. The child of sorrow and sad- ness-its mortal life was blighted, but all is sunshine in its new home. Lizzie is sad and unreconciled. She looks upon the past as a dreary waste. She does not see the fatherly hand that has led her thus far-but she will see it by-and-     208    Ta LP OOE OL CUPBOARD; O, by. The germs of a religions character are hidden under the weight of earthly care and sorrow, which has long pressed upon her, but it will struggle upwards to the light--it will not die. She is teaching a small school. Her brother insists upon paying her rent, and helps her in various ways. She will be brighter and happier soon. The heavenly plant must take strong root in good ground, before it will spring up and bring forth fruit, and it grow- eth we know not how. I thing we err in too great impa tience with our friends and ourselves. This re generation is a slow process, but no more mysterious than the growth of everything in the natural world. The same good God presides over all, and supplies to each its appropriate nourishment. This may be the last letter I shall send you from the West. Before another month, I shall see you face to face. Best of friends! with what pure satisfaction I shall look once more upon your living presence! Some natural regret I shall have, to-be-sure, in leaving this pleasant home forever, but through these years of my sojourn here, I have always, in spirit, turned back to New Eng- land, my birthplace, with yearnings that I could not sup- press or express; partly because it would not be proper or expedient to utter them; partly because it seemed ungrateful to the pleasant circle of acquaintances and the few friends I have formed here. True friendship is the rarest of all blessings. If you would prove the truth of this, go to a new place after you have reached mature life after yorr habits of thought and feeling are in a measure formed. Go among strangers. You will meet with kind. ness and courtesy-help in times of trouble, for there are kind hearts everywhere, and you will find friends accord- ing to the general acoeptation of the word-but if you   THE BVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVEY-DAY- PEOPLE. 209 hope to begin anew, friendships like those which have grown with your growth and strengthened with your strength, you will be disappointed. I am glad that I can return to the hills, to the sea shore, to the land of brooks and rivers pure as glass -yes, even to the bleak moun. tains and the rude rocks of New England, and to the friends, " whose adoption tried," I can feel are mine for- ever. The advantages of western life are many and great; but to me there is something higher and purer than temporal or social good. For me the past and future will soon meet and blend in one eternal now. Of Lizzie and her children, Rosalie and- Lucille, you will hear through Mary, when my scribbling pen is laid aside. But I must indulge in a little piece of gossip which may not be uninteresting to you, as you are acquainted with one of the parties. Mr. Rochester-the old bachelor- the reformer, is in a fair way of being reformed. He has lately taken to visiting, and makes himself quite at home in Rosalie's house. Yes, in the very midst of gayety, and fun, and visiting, there sits our demure old friend, with features relaxed and form no longer unbending, watching with manifest pleasure the quick, housewifely, energetic operations of the good-hearted widow, who has slid into her place in the household with a facility of adaptation truly admirable. I am seriously afraid for our Benedick. A widow with two pretty girls, and a son at college! Rosalie says he wears a new black coat and a black satin vest, and Lucille declares he asked her to teach him the waltz. What will be the end of it, who can guess? I have always thought his heart and his purse were closed against such vanities as pertain to women- young women in particular. What will become of philan- thropy, if he finds out he has a heart and wants of his own? 1* *       *    * * 18     210    THE OLD OOTNE OUPBOABD; O,S I think I told you in my last, that I should not write again from the West, but it has become such a fixed habit with me to devote a portion of my well days to you, that I feel lost unless I do it. Besides, I am so unusually bright and cheerful, it is a shame that I should not impart something of it to you, upon whom I inflict so much of my dullness. Nothing can exceed the beauty of the spring in this meridian. These soft, bland days, this budding verdure, this wealth of blossoming fruit trees, these hills vailed in a dreamy haze, and the smell of the teeming sod. Oh, how I love it Though longer delayed in your region, yet how gratefully we used to welcome it when we were young together, when we used to steal away, on some mild morning, and saunter in the woods and along the sunny side of the hills for hours, gathering our hands full of the blossoms of the Bloodroot and Adder's-tongue, and a little later, the perfumed Ephi- gea. Oh, how my heart swells when I think of it! The sweet, odorous Ephigeal rose-tinted, blooming amidst, snows, amidst decaying leaves, amidst the wrecks and the ruin of the old year I Next spring, when you gather it fresh, think of me. Press some of the fairest branches in your Bible, and as you open the book daily, which I know you do, think that my spirit drinks with yours from that "Well of living water." You will say, "It is well with Alice now. She has no more thirst. She dwells no more amidst shadows. All is real, substantial. In the clearer light of the spiri- tual world she reads the deep truths of life. She is happy-as happy as she can be." Yes, dear, you will say and feel this, when you open the book I gave you when we parted. You will not be sad.

SPRING, A FORESHADOWING OF HEAVEN. The Spring is here--the glad, the joyous Spring. The blue sky glows above, Like Heaven's enfolding love, And Earth, beneath its smile awakening, Hath deck'd herself with garlands of fresh flowers, As for a festival-- And with a coronal Of snowy blossoms, greets the smiling hours. The dim blue hills melt in the misty air, The quiet waters seem, As they Were in a dream; A filmy vail enwraps the branches bare; From the recesses of the lonely wood Snatches of jocund song Peal the gray boughs among, And break the spell of its deep solitude. Oh 1 if there cometh ever to the heart Visions of the blest land, Upon whose verge we stand, Before whose radiance earthly clouds depart, 'Tis when the Eternal Sun, that shines above, Awakes from mimic death The cold, damp sod beneath, And the great heart of Nature throbs with love. I wrote my last with the intention of telling you about my long walk and my visit to Rosalie, but was too tired to do so at that time.   I had not been out for weeks, owing to the damp and unpleasant walking. The morn- ing sun shone out warm and bright, the sky was blue, the whole earth smiling and full of beauty, and as soon as I had finished my breakfast I said: "   This day I will pass     212    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, in Spring street with Rosalie, her aunt, Lucille, and the girls." I had received a letter from William the day before, and knew that the same mail must have brought dis- patches to them also, which was an additional reason for going. The children accompanied me on their way to school, and I spent the day and evening with my friends. Nor am I the worse for it. On the contrary, I think I am better. In the course of the afternoon Mr. Rochester came: no unusual occurrence I was told. Of course he was invited to tea-of course he staid. Nothing of the outer man appeared as in former days, except the pepper and salt- pants, and they were brushed to a perfect nicety. The black coat and satin vest was not a myth, neither was the relaxed visage. Mrs. Mountford has been the innocent, perhaps uncon- scious cause of this happy change, thought I. She did indeed appear to be unconscious of her influence. Had she seen him a few months ago, she might have observed the great change which had taken place. From the moment the sunshine of her benevolent face shone on him ( so says Rosalie, and I believe her), it seemed to thaw him out. He has not been the same man since. His philanthropy has become more genial, more diffusive. I am not exag- gerating when I say, that even his former wrinkles have vanished. The knots and kinks into which he had forced his features, the wiry, angular motions of his tall, thin frame, all are gone. He glides in, sinks into the leather arm-chair so comfortably, looks about so complacently, feels evidently so much at home, that I cannot but think he is in his natural element now. Not that he has given up his reformatory ideas, but he has taken the sting out of his censures, and is content to co-operate with Divine provi- dence instead of trying to have everything his own way.   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 213 Yet nobody has said anything to change him. It has all been accomplished naturally, and in an orderly manner, as healthy plants unfold in the sunshine. His mistakes were of the head, and we must pardon them. He is an old bachelor. What kinks ought we not to forgive in an old bachelor! We had a social tea. My husband and little girls joined the party, and after tea we had dancing. After the quadrilles and waltzing an old fashioned country-dance was proposed, in which all but myself joined. I played the piano. Mr. Rochester and Mrs. Mountford led off- down outside-up again -join hands and down in the middle-cast off and right and left. They danced with such energy such hearty good-will and unwavering assi- duity, such determination to keep step until they reached the end, I cannot but think some amiable little spirit must have helped them. *   *    X.    *    * Now that we can meet occasionally face to face and talk together, what is the need of writing? Yet the old habit is strong upon me--a sort of uneasiness at my fingers' ends to hold a pen and to think on paper. Perhaps it is well for me that we are not always together. Surrounded by my children, Mary and Herbert, Emily and so many of my early friends, what excuse could I have for writing if you were not away  How could I steal the hour from time immemorial, consecrated to my own thoughts and meditations, and when strength would permit to writing letters or journalizing, if there were not one link wanting in the circle of loved ones about me? Those few days passed with you, how satisfying they were! I know you were pained at the change in me, but the sorrow has vanished now that my faded and worn out frame is removed from your sight. Now you can idealize me     214    THE OLD CORNER CUPBORD; OR, again. Do not let my mortal presence haunt you. Do not let it call up sad forebodings. Let the last hours of life be the best and brightest for my sake, for your sake, and for the sake of these young beings, who ought not to have the cold shadow of death thrown across their path, calling up emotions of gloom and ghostly spectres. If my complaints were not of a character to excite false hopes, I should almost believe I was getting well in my native air. The joy of my soul imparts a temporary vigor to my body.  That joy is an earnest of immortality. It springs from love, the love which is my life. Yesterday I went with my eldest daughter to the burying ground. Do you- remember the day when I went there with my first-born to visit my mother's grave? Some time after I wrote a few lines, which I will send you with this, and along with them another poem, written after my spring flower had faded from earth. You will read them and say, "Alice felt much. She had the poetic temperament, but she was not a poet." That is what you will say, if you are true to your own convictions, and you will speak the truth in part. The poetic element lies deep within my being, but it was never cultivated, harmonized, strengthened. Thus I have often felt the pains, but seldom the joys of the poet. Something was wanting. Perhaps it was the true genius perhaps only the skill, the science. I have no power to describe the want, I can only feel it. I have felt it in past years too deeply. I look back upon many states of my inner life, when my soul had an intense longing for expression, and yet the skill to clothe my thought in words was denied me. Study, industry, these are essen- tial to the outward development of the poetic nature. The god-spark lies deep in the interior life, but we must learn how to use it and manifest it to our own and others'   THE EVERY-DAY IrIFE OF EVEBY-DAY PEOPLE. 215 consciousness. I never learned. Thus, through the whole tissue of my earthly existence, may be seen a dark thread of dissatisfaction, arising from a consciousness of destiny unfulfilled, of aspirations unrealized. Yet am I sorry that it is so? If the grave were the end of life, yes; but with my belief in the eternity of progression, no. I may yet learn the poet-language, inspired by themes which -have never entered human conception, and in the anthems of worship, the outhreathings of love, and gratitude, and joy, I may yet pour forth the life of my soul. Do not believe that in this elevated state of hope I live at present. No, it only comes to me in visions occasion- ally. My heart will not cease its human longings until its human pulses are quiet. I was not ambitious in my youth, as people count ambition, yet I looked forward to a time when I should create by my spoken thought a bond of union with other hearts. I dreamed of those, whose souls would go forth to meet mine, as mine had met and mingled with those whose life, embodied in language, had been brought present to me. Why then has the hope and pro- mise been unfulfilled? Can you answer satisfactorily? Has it been through fault of mine, or was the hope a baseless illusion? Answer the everlasting ages this question--those ages which will make all clear, which here lies in obscu- rity. "The heart of a man deviseth his way, but the Lord directeth his steps." I laid out my path among pleasing illusions, but actual and homely realities claimed my thought and care. At first there was conflict. Duty and inclination clashed, but duty got the victory at last. Then began, by degrees, the inspirer of my dreams to elevate realities, and now, just as I feel a new ardor to impart a higher life and nobler purpose, yearning less to receive than to bestow, I hear the words echoing around and within me-not here! But God knows what is best for     216    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, us. These very stirrings of a holier life that animate me now, may be the effect of my nearness to the purer beings with whom I hope soon to be in communion. It may be because I am so near the shore of eternity, that these breathings from the celestial choir awaken those answer- ing chords which, in the vigor of mortal life, slumber in silence. I know what my friends will say when I am gone: "Poor Alice, she was all her life longing for some- thing that she had not yet attained, and this longing hindered her from seeing the heaven that lay around her; and just as she had learned to look within, for that which can never come to the soul from without-just as she had learned the true significance of life, she is taken away from it!"When you say this in sadness, while your heart still mourns for my absence, remember the words I write now. They come from my inmost convictions of truth. Had I lived here a hundred years, it would still have been the old story of something beyond, which would have made my life unsatisfactory-and it is best as it is. A taint of morbidness is my inheritance, and would have infected the atmosphere of my whole being in the flesh. God knew how much struggle I needed, how much I could bear, and when would be the right moment to release me. I have had much happiness. I look back and see it now, like golden light over the past, as the summer landscape is illumined by the dissolving radiance of the setting sun, and I do not care to distin- guish the shadows. *              *   . * MY MOTHER. My mother I long, long years have passed, Since half in wonder, half in dread, I looked upon thy clay-cold face, And heard the whisper-"She is dead!"   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE.       217 The memory of thine earthly form, Is dim as a remembered dream, But year by year, more close to mine Doth thy celestial spirit seem. When by the mouldering stone I stood, Which marks the spot where thou art laid, And with the daisies on the sod, My little child in gladness played, Oh! how my spirit longed to know If from the heights of heavenly joy, The love, that watched my infant years, Looked down to bless my bright-eyed boy I And when by anguish crushed and worn, I watched my bud of beauty fade, And in the cold and ghastly tomb, Beheld his lifeless body laid, And stranger eyes beheld my grief, Who in my joys had borne no part, Oh I how I thirsted then for thee To lift the load from off my heart. I know my faith is not a dream; My life from thine no power can wrest, Death's icy hand can never chill The lovs that warms a-mother's breast. And sqrely God through thee hath taught My soul submission to his will, With patient trust and child-like love, That I can suffer and be still. A LAMENT. The dreary winter had gone by, the breath Of the south-wind swept over hill and plain, Awaking from the icy spell of death, The bloom of earth again; The air, song-laden, trembled in its bliss, The clouds bent low the mountain tops to kiss, The unchained brooks, with shout and song, Hurried their pebbly beds along; The earth was fair as on creation's morn, And Hope to human hearts seemed newly-born, So beautiful, in its first blossoming, Was the overflowing gladness of the Spring. 19     218      THE OLD CORNEL CUPBOARD; OB, And with the birds and flowers, and all things fair, To our dear home there came a gift most rare- An innocent little child- Through him, God on us smiled. It seemed to bring the inmost heaven of joy Close to our souls, to look upon our boy. He was a poet from his earliest birth; The garish splendor of the sunlit stream, The dancing shadows, dappling the green earth, Lived in his souls clear depths-a pictured dream Of beauty. Ere his untaught lips could frame Language to clothe his thought, sweet voices came From wood, and stream, and mountain to his ear, Which grosser senses strove in vain to hear; For he was Nature's fair and favored child, By her pure presence still kept undefiled. Three years How short they were! Three precious years, His Heavenly Father left him in our care, And then-despite our agony and tears, Bore him to Paradise to blossom there. Oh I twice those years our sorrowing hearts have told, Since our dear lamb was gathered to the fold. Still his bright image haunts our waking hours, Still is he newly-born with early flowers, And still, when autumn-leaves bestrew the plain, We seem to bury his fair form again, And wild November winds, with hollow moan, Ask vainly for the loved one who has flown. Where, where art thou, my song-bird, tell me where? That I may plume my spirit's drooping wing And follow thee. Dost thou not need our care  Can our deep love no added rapture bring To thy enfranchised spirit? To thy home, Say, dost thou never sigh for us to come, That we may share with thee thy untold joy? Thou, who on earth wert never from our sight, Seeking our sympathy with thy delight, Hast thou no longer need of us, my boy? The little toys-the garments trim and neat- The half-worn shoes that graced thy tiny feet- The velvet cap, from whence thy golden hair Floated like sunbeams o'er thy forehead fair- We cannot part with them-our memory Clings to them, as they were a part of thee!

O bitter day I That saw this credulous faith decline and perish. Spring-time and summer o'er the earth will bloom, Covering with verdant beauty e'en thy tomb, But thou wilt come no more, with bloom and flowers, To beautify and bless this world of ours. The love that mourns thy loss, with ceaseless pain, Has not one spell to bring thee back again. Yet, if by thinking of thee as thou art- Striving to blend with thine the purer part Of our own being-brings us nearer thee, That, through thine eyes, the Father we can see, We may yet live to bless the dreary hour, That hid thee from our sight-our life's first flower. *    *     *     *     * I still continue so well that I am resolved to keep up a brisk correspondence. Your promise of coming to see me, every fortnight, might seem to do away with the ne- cessity of this medium of communication, but the truth is, I can write with less effort th an I cantalk, on account of my hoarseness and shortness of breath. As the case is otherwise with you, I shall expect to be a listener while you are with me, and be nourished by your words and your presence.  I passed nearly the whole day, yesterday, alone with Emily. Mary and her children, with my own, were off on a pic-nic excursion. Poor Emily's injury prevented her joining them, though she is well otherwise, and very cheerful. She wears an abstracted look at times, but not a dejected one.  It occurred to me to try and penetrate this little mystery, which otherwise I may not live to see unfolded; so I began talking of William and his expedition, which I pronounced a very foolish and boyish thing. No answer. "I suppose one reason of his going," I continued, "was to remove himself from    the fascinations of the beautiful Lucille, who evidently had     220    THE OLD CORNER OUPBOARD; OR, deep designs upon his peace; but that was a cowardly mode of proceeding, after all." "Perhaps it was more out of consideration for her feel- ings than any fear on his own account," said Emily, not looking up from her work. "He might have thought it best to save her future unhappiness." "So much the worse," said I, indignantly, "as it proves he has an inordinate vanity, and he ought to be above it." "But you say Lucille's feelings are evident, or, rather, her designs. If they were evident to you who saw them together but seldom, they must have been very plain to him who was with her so constantly, when she must have been under less restraint." "Still I don't see the necessity of his going a thousand miles off to escape the danger, and running into dangers a thousandfold more terrific. He might have guarded his heart from the attacks of a pretty woman more easily than he can guard his head among wolves and wild Indians. If he must run away why not come here with us? We would not have troubled him with questions, or flattered his weaknesses. He might have been as non-committal as he pleased. No, the truth is, he always runs headlong after some impulse-some phantom of his own brain-and does not care for consequences. He ought not to have left his sister and his child for such a wild-goose chase, and I don't intend to forgive him." Smile and no answer. "I wonder you can be so composed?"I continued, " as you cannot be ignorant of the dangers of such a journey." I am glad she did not look up as I said this, for she would have perceived the smile which strangely belied my words, for I was comparing, in my own mind, other dangers which might have resulted from a journey in an   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. a23 opposite direction. But then there was an object in striv. ing to overcome those, more satisfactory than in combat- ing bears and wolves.- "You know, I suppose, that he is coming here this au- tumn to see me," said I. "I made him promise. I love William as if he were a son. I could not bear to think I might never see him again; so he promised to come, and I know if he lives he will keep his word: for he is as true as steel. Yes, I love William, and the dear little boy. I wish he could come, too. In September I shall visit the sea-shore. We have soft, mild days in Septem- ber, you know, and I wish particularly to be there then, if only for a few days, to revive some asociationa -of my youth that are very interesting to remember." "What are they, dear Aunt Alice?" asked Emily, looking up with eager eyes. "I always like to hear people, who are no longer young, talk of their youth- ful days.  What happened on the sea-shore  Did Uncle .Dearbon offer himself to you there I Come, tell me, pray." I thought she'was quite as eager to change the conver- sation as to hear my story, and decided to gratify her in both particulars. So I told her of my having been sent with a good aunt, to be out of harm's way-the danger being in the shape of a wild, gay young man, who had made love to me, contrary to my parents' pleasure, and in whom I was very much interested, or, as the common phrase is, in love. "Were you ever in love before you met Uncle Dear- bon?" she asked with surprise. "I thought I was-more than once," I answered. "I cannot see how it is possible to be in love more than once,"-said Emily, "or to be in doubt about one's real feelings." O        .     22    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, "There is a very good reason for your opinion," I eaid. She looked up in amazement, as if to inquire what I meant. "My dear little girl, your eyes are blue and mine are black. That is reason enough for you. Destiny, dear, destiny. Blue eyes constant; black eyes fickle. We cannot change destiny." "What do you mean, aunty " she inquired. "Nothing-absolutely nothing," I replied. "But, as I was saying, whether true or not, I believed myself in love, I won't say how many times, before I ever saw Mr. Dear- bon; and there is no sort of use in quarreling with des- tiny. Perhaps if I had not had opportunities of com- paring my feelings at different stages of my existence, I might not have known the true love at all." "I should never wish the opportumity," said Emily. "But do go on. This wild young man-"  "Found me out even there, and, in spite of my body-guard, contrived to see me and speak with me. It was one afternoon on the beach, he told me he was going to sea before the mast. If he sowed his wild oats in the ocean, that would be the end of them. He wished me to engage myself to him before he left. I did not. I was not a very dutitl .'ghter; but I had enough respect to my father's feelings to prevent this rashness; besides, I was not prepared to say I would give up everything for him. He had many noble traits, yet I could not trust him. He left for foreign countries. The vessel came safe again to port, but it did not bring him back. He plunged into the gayety and dissipation of foreign capitals. He was wrecked, good name, fortune, everything, and he died a miserable gambler." "I should think you would hate to visit a spot calling   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 223 up such associations," said Emily; "yet you say they are what you love to remember." "You mistake my meaning, dear child," I said. "It is not the illusion of fancy that I love to recall, but the hand of Providence that led me in safety through that, and has continued to guide me through so many unseen dangers and temptations. It was an epoch in my life, when passion yielded to judgment, and I had strength given me to be firm. At that time and in that place, when he had left me, and I felt that I had acted wisely, the great conflict began-the conflict between duty and impulse--in my wayward existence.  Romance had hitherto enveloped every aspect of life. I had been, till then, a mere dreamer. I had looked upon everything through the medium of imagination. There I first awoke to the consciousness of the necessity for self-sacrifice, and there were breathed my first feeble prayers for wisdom and strength. You will never have such an experience, Emily." "And why should I not?" she asked. "(Because you do not need it, child. We all have the discipline we need. Yours is a gentler nature than mine. And, as to love, you speak truly in saying you will not doubt, when you really love. It will be once and forever. God grant you may love wisely." "A New England village," said Mary, the other day, is a problem for a philosopher." "Is that the result of your meditation for the last half hour??"I inquired. We had been sitting together in silence so long as to have become quite unconscious of each other's presence. "I have been thinking," she continued, "of this, that, and the other person I knew years ago. Alice, do you know why it is that all the finest young men in our     224    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, villages go away, and the best of our women remain single?" "Why the young men go away, is a question very easily answered," I replied, " and because they go away, is one answer to the question why the women remain. single." "That is one answer, truly," replied Mary. "The young men go where they can have a wider sphere-a larger field for activity-where there are better chances for making money, and for becoming distinguished; and it follows, as a matter of course, that the young. women are left without suitable opportunities of changing their con- dition. But what has become of romance? Is there no such thing as a youthful attachment? no such thing as constancy? no poetry of love extant? People are not half as happy in this world as they ought to be--as they might be. But the root of the evil lies too deep for me to fathom. I may be deceived in judging by appearances, but how few women look happy, positively happy. So- ciety is all wrong, I am persuaded. You know I always said so, and although I am better satisfied with my own little niche than I once was, still I say people in the world, particularly our women, are not as happy as God intended them to be." "And what are you going to do about it?"I asked. "How   provoking you are, Alice," said she. "I will send to Mr. Rochester to assist me in reforming the world." "He might dig a long time, in this hard soil, for the roots of many social evils," I added. ( But as he has found a remedy in his own case, for one, at least, of his sources of unhappiness, perhaps he may assist others, at least by proving to them the truth of the old adage- ' Better late than never.' "   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 235 "But Alice," said Mary, seriously, "it is not only a deep-rooted evil, but a fast growing one. Look now, there is scarcely a young person in. our village. How melancholy that long row of prim, white houses looks, with blinds fast closed, everything without in such precise order, and everything within so proper and respectable. You inquire about that one and the other, who were young once, and all, as our bright friend E -- says, are in 'states of mind.' Seriously now, something ought to be done about it at once, and who shall do it if not you and I? You have suggested one reason, but there are others more available for our purposes. Since we cannot persuade the enterprising and ambitious of the young men to take root at home, can we not make youthful romance and poetry more genteel or fashionable? Can we not suggest some improvements in the cold forms of society, and bring young people together more simply and naturally? Can we not persuade parents to be young again in their children, and thus win their confidence and trust? Can we not, in short, convince ourselves and others, that truth 'and nature are better than convention- ality? Can we have none of those charming heart- histories that we read about in romances-of love that grew up from childhood-of hearts that were drawn to each other from babyhood? Is there no such thing as spiritual affinity? We stand in false relations, men and women each to the other, therefore how can we expect to arrive at a thorough knowledge of each other? I wish I could read the inmost experience of some single women I know. But they will not reveal the secrets of their prison-house." "Then should we not respect their reserve, and not seek to penetrate into the innermost of their being." I asked.     226    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, "Individually I do so," replied Mary. "It is as a class that I intend to look at them now--a class becoming larger in the progress of civilization and intellectual refine- ment: and yet the culture of the intellect never can com- pensate a woman for the want of objects to fill her affec- tions. I can give you an illustration. Look at Harriette B --. You knew her when she was beautiful and young, full of talent, brilliant in conversation, and of superior intellectual endowments. You would have said, if any one had resources for happiness in herself, it was she. Yet you see how changed she is now. Pale, haggard, sarcastic, sick, and uncomfortable. She has made some great mistake in life. What is it?" '"Perhaps she made more than one," I answered. c"She would have been more than mortal if she had not made many. Nevertheless I can, without breach of confidence, speak of one, for which, if her own heart does not con- demn her, she stands reproved by the judgment of her friends. On the hill yonder you can discover, through the trees, a fine, spacious house, with an avenue of chest- nuts leading from the road to the door. In that house lives the son of a worthy mechanic, who was born and brought up in our village. They were homely people- the father and mother both-and had but this one son. He was an ambitious lad, and wanted an education; but they could not afford to give him one, so he resolved to make his own way. He worked at his trade in the day- time, and studied evenings, until he fitted himself for col- lege. In order to raise money to defray the expenses of his collegiate course, he taught a town school. At some of the village gatherings he was introduced to Harriette, and fell as desperately in love with her as he dared under the circumstances-her father being a member of Con- gress, and his own a mechanic. He was handsome and   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVEY-DAY rPEOPLE.  227 intelligent, and as well-bred as could be expected of one who had never acquired the external polish of good soci- ety. But there was no mystery, no prestige about him. Everybody knew who and what his father was, which, under certain circumstances, may be the greatest draw- back to a man's success. Nevertheless Harriette was- discriminating enough to discover his superiority to most young men of her acquaintance, and showed a decided preference for his society. His admiration for her was unbounded. In short, he became really in love. She,  could not relinquish the pleasure of his society. Her vanity was gratified by his admiration, but her pride forbade her to return his love. The affair went on for some time, finally he became emboldened to offer himself, and was refused. He graduated honorably, and went to school-keeping again, studying a profession at the same time. The next we heard of him, years after, he was married to the daughter of a wealthy merchant of -- , who has since died and left them rich, and now they live at their charming country-seat, and his widowed mother with them.  There is not a man in 'our village' more respected. No one knew better than Harriette, his capabilities, but ' a prophet has no honor in his own country.' c( A looker-on would pronounce her rejection of a true, manly heart from such unworthy motives a great mistake in Harriette's life, particularly as she was not unconscious of his worth or insensible to his admiration. But ' trifles light as air,' sometimes turn the scale of a woman's lot, and we all must reap as we sow." "That is one case, now tell me another, and vindicate our sex from the charge of worldliness and false pride," said Mary. "O! I could tell you of many a history worthy of point-     228    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, ing a moral ' or adorning a tale," I replied. "Of women who loved 'not wisely but too well.' Of some 'who never told their love;' of others who aspired too high; of others still, who were deceived. I recall one at this moment-a good old maid--the aunt Kindly of the neigh- borhood, whose heart was thrown away on one who could not estimate its value, and who repaid her fidelity by in- difference. Too cowardly to confess his inconstancy and ask for a release, he led her on year after year, trusting that her sensitive nature would receive the wound of his unkindness by slow degrees, and his own neglect gra- dually wear out her constancy. It was a slow but sure poison, and with the conviction that she was no longer the object of his affection, to whom all her youth was sac- rificed, she seemed to pass at once beyond the boundary of hope and anticipation, into a desert. It was not long after the termination of their engagement that she heard of his marriage to a young, blooming girl. What she suffered no one knew. Such sorrows have no voice. What she has achieved through the sacrifice of herself, you and I can see and lay to heart." "And is he happy with his young blooming wife?" asked Mary. "I hope not, after breaking onie woman's heart." "Wicked one!"I exclaimed. "Let me set you right on one point. Whether he is happy or not, I cannot judge. 'Leave him to Heaven and to the thorns which in his bosom lodge,' but don't say of her, that she has a broken heart. ' Whosoever will lose his life for my sake, shall find it.' God helps those who consecrate themselves to others as she has done, filling the void which human love could not fill; drawing towards himself the soul's intensest yearnings. And Mary, there is nothing in life but God's love that can fill the void. You may talk of   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY DAY- PEOPLE.  229 intellectual culture, of esthetic tastes, of this and that re- source, but it is all a mockery without this higher life, with its infinite consolation and hope and blessedness. 'Nor do those alone whose lot seems most solitary, need this bond uniting them to something purer and nobler than the present. There is not a woman that lives, mar- ried or single, gifted or humble, whatever her station, her influence, her condition, who does not feel often and bit- terly, how unsatisfying- is all that life offers, even in its fullness, to the heart that craves an infinite love, a bound- less trust, a peace in believing that no vicissitude can disturb." "And does not man need this staff also, Alice!" asked Mary. "I cannot judge for man," I replied. "Man's nature is unlike woman's, and there are many avenues through which he can work and go out of himself, and not feed upon his own sorrows." "And ought there not to be more avenues for woman also?" asked Mary. "Ought she to live so much in and through the affections? Is not her life directed too en- tirely into one channel?" "If you expect a solution of any great problem from me, Mary," said I, "you will look in vain. I always take things as they are, and my own experience guides me in my judgment of others. We see, even in childhood, that girls live in the affections. In their plays, in their love of dolls and pets, in their bosom friendships, in short, in all their manifestations, we see the feminine element developing step by step to the consummation of their destiny- marriage. However we may reason about it, scoff at it, turn away from it, we do it at our peril, for the finger of God points to that end and its results, as the highest and the most important in its consequences. How     ov    'TI'H OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, our perverted system of education has distorted this beau- tiful arrangement of the Divine Providence for the per- fection of human happiness, you know as well as I, for you, like myself, have grown into a higher knowledge, founded on experience and an earnest seeking after truth; and I trust that both of us will be able, in the bringing up of our children to present to their opening intelligence and eager questionings, the reality of what is so often set aside, or silenced by a frown of disapproval or a smile of ridicule. We cannot check the growth of this yearning- our duty is to direct it. Its manifestations are as various as the characters in which it springs, but its foundation is in the inmost of being. We may warp and distort the external life, we may set up worldly objects, worldly advantages, self-interest, or any other idol we please be- fore the young heart, and say, that is the true good, the permanent, the substantial-all this idealism, all this ro- mance that wears so beguiling an aspect, is an illusion; but we cannot kill the germ which God has implanted in the heart. It will spring up and bear fruit-it may be the bitter fruit of disappointment and anguish; it may be that in sorrow, the deceived one eats of it all the days of her life, but she cannot say, I .will not eat of it. There is no pity in the law that has been violated. Let us then seek to know these laws of our being, and live by them ourselves, and teach them to our children. Indeed I know of nothing in the ordinary mode of educating the young so full of injustice to them, as the off-hand way so many have of dismissing their little confidences and earn- est inquiries. Nature prompts them to ask a thousand questions. She has implanted in them a longing to dis- close the workings of their young hearts to some one who can understand them. And whom do they seek? Not the mother who has been young, who has trodden the   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVEBY-DAY PEOPLE. 231 same path, been lured by the same dangers and tempta- tions, been betrayed by the same impulses into the same errors; they dare not pour out their hearts to her. What they thirst for, is sympathy, and they go where they think they shall find it, or if timid and reserved of nature, they lock up their feelings in their own breasts, form an ideal world, waste their life in musing, unfit themselves for realities, and become morbid and sensitive-weak in soul and body. And all this because we will not look at truth as God has stamped it upon our human nature, and because society has set up its model men and women, that we have grown to think are a little better than God's creations, at any-rate more-genteel. Trust me, Mary, no virtue in the world is at so great a discount -as simplicity of character. It is as much as one's reputation is worth, to dare to be true and sincere, and single-minded. "But what am I talking myself into a fever for, without even the merit of an argument? I know you agree with me, that nature should have an orderly development, and that, as we cannot improve upon God's laws, the wisest thing is to try and conform to them. I don't think we should throw the blame of this great evil of celibacy on the Lord's Providence, but on a false education. If men and women led truer lives they would undoubtedly be happier; and as marriage is, a Divine appointment, and all Divine laws, if followed, would lead to the greatest- good, of course, if every soul had its mate the sum total of happiness would be greatly augmented. But I am quite sure my life will not be long enough to put all the world right. I have set my sisters a good example. If they don't choose to follow it, that is their affair."' "But you needn't feel so set up in your wisdom," said Mary. ( I am determined not to let the subject drop, and     232    THE OLD COONEB OUPBOARD; OR, some day I intend to write a book for my benighted sisters. But I shall wait till thisffuror, which pervades the feminine part of creation,- has abated, for when I write a book I wish to have it read, and it would stand a poor chance at the present time, while such ' a crop of books,' written by women, is pouring in upon us. In the mean- time, I shall be collecting facts and experiences-diving into the secret causes of things-analyzing, comparing, combining, and by-and-by you will hear the result. You perceive, my dear, that the time has come for woman to speak out in some way. The very silence to which public sentiment has condemned her for so long, has so concen- trated her life that she would consume away entirely if there was no outlet to her feelings. "I don't think I shall turn lecturer, because spoken words are but modulations of sound and soon forgotten. I shall write a book, when the propitious moment arrives, and society has need of just such a book as I, and only I can write. I shall write a book for woman. I shall try and prove that everybody ought to be happily married. Perhaps, for the sake of the argument, I shall affirmsthat even a marriage not as happy as it might be, is better than none at all, because under a positive evil, one always finds some compensation, and there is a satisfaction in having tried every promised good, even if one finds it wanting. Then I shall investigate the causes of this social error, and try to discover the remedy. Then I shall illustrate my work with little sketches of domestic happi- ness, drawn from life, and wind up with ' Confessions of an Old Maid,' and lastly, 'An Application' in the manner of old Parson W-----'s sermons." "And before you publish your book," said I, "you must make a compact with all the married people of your   THE EYVEY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 2B8 acquaintance to wear cheerful and contented faces, that no ill-disposed critic can pronounce your arguments shal- low and your facts fallacies. "A suggestion most opportune, " said -Mary; "and I will set the example. Ah, Alice would to heaven it could be as easily followedI that every woman in the world found it as easy, as I do, to be happy, and had as good cause as I have to call marriage a Divine appoint- ment! But if I begin to be egotistical, I shall end with being very foolish, so I must leave you and walk off this effervescence; only answer one question: Since so many women will stay single, in spite of all one can say or do, what is the surest way to promote their happiness in single life, and make their state actually one of ' single blessedness M ' " "If I had time to reflect upon this question," said I, "I might give you the condensation of wisdom. But I have not the time, neither have I the strength to arrange my ideas in order. The thought, most prominent in my mind at this moment, is this: Women are affectional beings. God made them so, and their highest happiness is in obedience to this- law of their nature. It is in vain to substitute other interests, or to force themselves to walk- in other paths. Their hearts are only satisfied with love. Fortunately there is no spot on this earth where human affections may not find objects to bless. The poor, the unhappy, the neglected are all around us. All around us are little children, appealing to our sympathy, looking to us for guidance and direction, asking for the love that is lavished -on unworthy objects, or wasted in pursuits that are as aimless and hollow as the hearts engrossed by them. Surely no woman -need grow cold, or harsh, or bitter, or feel she has no place in a world where the gentle ministrations of love are so much needed. It is only in 20     234    THE OLD CORNE OUPBOABD; OR, going out of her sphere, or refusing to walk in her God- appointed path, that woman's heart becomes a dry and barren desert. If she has not those objects to love which she can call )her own- let her be a co-worker with the Infinite Father and gather into the fold of her affections those who are starving for the blessing her heart aches to bestow, and she will never be alone-never unhappy. When you write your book, Mary, devote one chapter to this subject: The true sphere of woman. Although I may fail to convey to you my deep sympathy with the question that so greatly agitates you at this moment, believe me, I feel it at my heart's core, for I love my kind, I love my sisters everywhere, I suffer with them, and I long to help them. I watch with great interest the move- ments of the day-listen with an earnest desire to know the truth, to all the arguments in favor of woman's rights, and acknowledge, with bitter sorrow, the wrongs under which she groans. Still the end of all my reflections is the same. It is not liberty to vote, to speak in public, to learn this, that, and the other trade or profession, to stand on the same intellectual platform with man, and to receive the same intellectual culture. This she can do if she pleases, but this will not secure the good she is seeking, if the eternal distinctions which God has implanted in her nature are forgotten or laid aside; and it seems to me that, instead of striving to be as man, she should study rather to be more womanly if she would exert that influence in society to which she aspires. She must work through and by her affections. The constant shining of the warm sun will melt, drop by drop, the glaciers which an iron hand might wrestle with in vain. Go, now, to walk. I am tired of talking-tired of thinking. Write your book. I will help you to truer thoughts when you under- take the task, for I shall be where I can see more deeply   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 235 into the causes of things, and I will flow into your thought with an inspiration that you will feel, although you may never aeknowledge or even suspect it is mine, Bathed in an atmosphere of love-my heart throbbing in unison with the myriads of happy beings who rejoice to do their Father's will-no chains to clog-no weakness-no weari- ness--no pain to remind me of mortality--I will work with you-love with you--feel with you and rejoice with you. Go now to walk and leave me to rest; but do not, for the world, breathe a word of what I have said above a whisper, lest these trees, which screen the windows oppo- site, should only have been pretending sleep, and as soon as your back is turned, should reveal to the truant wind your secret about the book, and all our wise sayings about human and divine institutions, and somebody should be beforehand with us, in giving the results of our investiga- tions to the world. Mary promised all I wished, tied on her bonnet, and in quite too high a pitch of enthusiasm to find her gloves, (alas my friend is not altogether made up by rule) hast- ened down stairs'for a walk. I saw her from the window, hurrying as if in pursuit of something in the far distance- walking with her whole soul-swinging her arm, as Bos- ton women will always do-and there was such an energy, such determination in every attitude and motion, so much freedom and grace too, that I could not check a feeling of satisfaction as I watched her out of sight, and reflected that, whatever she put her hand to, and her heart in, she would do with all her might. I suppose we may look for her book when she prefers writing to action. In the meantime may there be many to grow wiser and happier by her example. Mary and myself have many talks about Emily, but Mary and myself have many talks about Emily, but     236    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, are, both of us, still in the dark respecting her sentiments towards William.- We differ, however, in our specula- tions. I am sure she loves him, and has some token whereby she is convinced of his love for her, which tends to keep hope alive, and accounts for her cheerfulness dur- ing their separation, and her tedious confinement. Mary thinks that, if they had remained longer together, she would, doubtless, have been in love, but being removed from his immediate presence, the sentiment has subsided into friendship; and having never received from him assurances of any stronger feelings than a brotherly inter- est, besides having observed his admiration of Lucille, she, with great good sense and womanly dignity, holds herself free, and is, in fact, heart-whole. She is quite satisfied with the course she decided upon to come here, and the good results which manifestly have followed- barring always this sad injury which, painful as it is, as Mary says, is nothing compared with the blight and sor- row which unrequited affection would have cast upon her life, Emily, love, which of us is right? I am sure you will be on my side, inasmuch as you are aware how many times I have proved myself a true prophet in such cases, in trusting to my natural romance and my sympathy with young people, which, I thank the good Father, is still warm and true, and which I feel will not expire with my natural life. Romance, however it may be opposed to the facts and actual occurrences on our earth, is a prophecy of the soul's capabilities for happiness. Poetry is the highest truth. To fall far short of our ideal, is by no means a proof that it is an illusion. Whether in the world of spirits there is making love and spiritual union, is a question I can only answer to my own satisfaction. But it forms so important a part of life here, and seems so to spring from an eternal necessity of the soul, that I   TE EVERY-DAY LIFE -OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. ant do not see how anything short of annihilation can destroy these attractions and affinities. . But I do not forget what  rebuff I met with, years ago, when I, thought I had learned a new truth and had a childish desire to. make proselytes, and, in the fullness of my own satisfaction, made very ample communications to a friend. Instead of awaken- ing sympathy and interest, I was quite put down for en- tertaining the belief that we existed in the other world as organized beings. She preferred the idea of being a thought--a floating vapor-a principle-anything but a living, feeling, organized existence in the human form. Since then I have been cautious of speaking of any peculiar doctrines to the uninitiated. To return to realities, however, and leave what may appear to you mere idle speculations, let me tell you yet more of Emily. Day after day she sits in her easy chair, with the same sweet, hopeful smile, never weary, never expressing even a longing to be out among the hills and the woods with her young companions, but to all appear. ance filled with the joy of her own thoughts. She thinks she shall recover, although she says she knows her im- provement must be very slow. She walks a little back and forth in her room, and occasionally on the piazza. The children keep her supplied with flowers. She listens to their chat, dresses their dolls, plans pleasant excur- sions for them, and makes all of us feel that she is notlonely even if alone. She amuses herself with draw- ing a good deal: has made sketches of many pretty points in the landscape which she sees from her favorite window, and she looks sometimes to me, as she sits in the rosy light of the gloaming, like an angel. I am with her a good part of the day, as I am unable to join the rural excursions of the others. I know every spot of the village by heart, and the history of almost every family     288    UTHE OLD CORNER OUPBOARD; OR, in the neighborhood: so I talk about this and that event which happened when I was young, and, like all story- tellers, figure myself largely in my narrations. She, brought up so well in the light and under the healthy influence of a genial and rational Christianity, besides being, in some respects, very differently constituted from myself, cannot comprehend the vagaries, the impetuosity, the indiscretions of a character such as mine was in youth. But it interests her to have me relate the little incidents of my early life, and it interests me to turn over the pages of memory with her. There are, however, whole days when the spell of silence is on me, and I cannot talk at all. On those days I write in my journal, read, meditate, and strive to bring into communion with my own spirit, the beings who will soon be visible to my inner sigllt, and the Almighty Father, in whose presence I must soon appear. Are not my last earthly days bright and beauti- ful? Where are the shadows? What has become of all my dread? How is it that I do not shrink more from a change that once seemed so terrible, and why do I not- feel greater anguish at the thought of separation from my beloved ones? Is not this the answer? God gives us the strength needed -for all emergencies, and mercifully affords every alleviation which can make our inevitable trials as light as possible. Letters, received to-day from-Rosalie and Lucille, have thrown a shadow over our .hitherto-bright life. Rumors of the shocking murder of Capt. Grey of the exploring expedition, together with others of the party whose names are not given, fill us with terrible apprehensions for the safety of our dear young friend. As yet, nothing official has reached us; but there is little doubt that the party is disbanded, and the leader killed. How many have   THE EVERY-DAY ..LIFE O EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 289 perished, or how many have been taken captive by the Indians, is not ascertained, nor can be, until some of the party return or send direct intelligence to their friends at home, My apprehensions were gloomy from the first. Poor William! What he may be suffering at this mo- ment, if he should indeed be alive, seems worse than death! Rosalie is nearly distracted. We must hope for the best. Poor Emily! I see her anguish in her face, from which every ray of lappiness has vanished. This state of uncertainty will retard her recovery, perhaps render it hopeless. You must come and cheer us. We try to talk as if we had hope, and for her sake, we try to be hopeful-cheerful influences are so necessary to her restoration. Mary thinks she shall remove her to the sea shore very soon. It wants some weeks yet of the time appointed for William to join us. I do not give up hope, but how suddenly our bright summer is clouded! We must try and have more faith. Even if the worst should befall him, we should remember there is no such thing as accident-nothing can take place by chance. Letters from Rosalie again. The papers give all the particulars of the terrible disaster that can be obtained. There is still hope that William is safe, as his name is not among the list of murdered. A few of the party con- trived to escape and reach St. Louis, and he may be among them. They give horrible details of the barbarity of the Indians. Calt Grey and several of his men were butchered, many others taken prisoners. Hope of Wil- liam's safety and ultimate escape does not desert me, but I can offer very little encouragement to my poor friends. Emily looks sick and wretched. She tries to be cheer- ful. She forces herself to keep busy, but there is no heart in anything she does. Her eyes are heavy with the tears     240    THE OLD OORNER CUPBOARD; OR, she cannot shed; the sweet thoughts that were mirrored in their blue depths, like a summer landscape in a still lake, are all vanished. Even the deep blue has faded. Her brow is anxious and careworn. Mary speaks with self-reproach of having been the cause of all, and fears she acted hastily. How cruelly we are prone, in seasons of sorrow, to afflict ourselves! She acted from the light she had, and with a conviction that it was her duty. This is all we can any of us do. We ought not to blame our- selves for errors in judgment, if our endeavor is to do right. Why can we not learn to leave results with the All-seeing  Lizzie also has written to me within the last week. She has several scholars, and being constantly occupied, is in a fair way to regain a healthful tone of mind. Lu- cille is engaged to a foreigner, who, it is said, has a title and is rich. Mr. Rochester still continues his visits to the widow, as her affianced husband. The last relic of the old man is put off-the old gray pants have given place to black broadcloth of the newest cut. You remember our friend A-'s definition of a philanthropist: "One who hates people and loves principles." To no one did this apply so closely as to Mr. Rochester in former times. But our advocate for freedom and equal rights is now in chains himself. I am afraid he will exclaim, in the words of the Spanish Ladye in the old ballad: "Still let me retain this dear captivitie." Mary and her children, with Emily, have been gone to the sea-shore several days. I miss them sorely. My husband is absent, just now, on business, my girls at school during the day, and I am left alone to think. I have sealed up my journal, and dedicated it to my dear children. I shall not write in it any more. When they   THE EVEBY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 241 are older, it will be pleasant to them to read it. Many little anecdotes of their childhood are recorded there. I have sketched their characters, as they present themselves to me, perhaps with a mother's partiality and fondness, but that will not make it less valuable. If I over-esti- mated their virtues, it will be a stimulus to self-examina- tion and self-improvement. In its pages also, they will read many phases of my inner experience, which may serve as a light to guide them, and through which my heart can yet speak to theirs. Dear children! I do not ask happy years for them, if by that is understood ex- emption from sorrow, and care, and anxiety, but that they may be guided through the trials of life, to the only source of comfort and strength. I know that they must suffer. If suffering is the lot of man, much more is it of woman; but all suffering, rightly viewed, reveals a deeper capacity of happiness. Before my husband left me, we took a pleasant drive along the old familiar places. It is probably the last time I shall visit them. Years ago-it matters not to enumerate them-the road through which we passed now, was a foot-path where the lovers in our village were wont to walk at twilight. Some of the old landmarks still remain. Many pleasant little associations cluster around these paths-but you know what they are, and I need not repeat them. I look forward, with real happiness, to the month you have promised to spend with me. I cannot run about with you, but you shall bring to me, in my pleasant room, tokens of the glad sunshine and the green fields. You shall go out "when the dew is on the grass," and come back with the smell of the fresh, cool earth on your gar- ments. Do you know that I am writing to you now in the very same room where I used to sit and write my first 21     2458     THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, published book, my "Poems and Essays for Children," with my subjects, in the shape of engravings, strewed all about; my husband busy also, and our golden-haired, blue-eyed boy, sitting in the midst of his playthings, building up and pulling down-eager-earnest-glad of heart-and the gladdener of our hearts? I seem to see him now!  "I cannot make him dead," although- "I know his face is hid Under the coffin lid- Closed are his eyes, cold is his forehead fair; My hand that marble felt, O'er it in prayer I knelt, Yet my heart whispers that --he is not there. "Not there I Where, then, is he? The form I used to see,      * Was but the raiment that he used to wear. The grave that now doth press Upon that cast-off dress, Is but his wardrobe locked- he is not there. "He lives I In all the past He lives; nor, to the last, Of seeing him again will I despair. In dreams I see him now: And on his angel brow I see it written-Thou shalt see me there." +     r     *     *     * I shall bid adieu to our village to-morrow, and, by easy journeys, join my friends at the Beach, stopping at L--- on my way, to see, again, one glorious sunset behind the wooded hills, and to greet the old friends there. I do not say it, but I know none the less surely, it will be for the last time. One of my pets, the daughter of a schoolmate who lives near us, brought me a fancy cap, trimmed with rosettes and loops of the most delicate pink, begging me to wear it for her sake. I think it takes away a little of the ghostly look of my face, and imparts the very slight- eat tinge of red to my cheek; so not only for her saks,   TH E BVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE, 243 but for the sake of all who see me, I shall wear it. I wish to leave as pleasant an impression as possible, particu- larly upon the minds of the young. For this reason I do not forbid my children, who assist me in dressing, to fasten my collar with a bow of ribbon, and arrange my hair according to their notions of good taste and becom- ingness. And when they press their young, fresh lips to my poor, faded cheek, I feel glad that I am not unlovely to them, and that they are not shocked when they look at me. I do not think sick people take sufficient thought to make the most of their advantages. It is so much the custom to exclude sunshine, and pleasing objects pertaining to outward life from their apartments, and in place of articles of taste and beauty, to display battalions of vials, and boxes, and potions, which could as easily be kept out of sight. All external life should be as bright and healthful as it can be made for the sick, as well as for those who have the care of them; and nurses should wear as cheerful and hopeful a look as they can, losing no opportunity of saying a word of comfort, encouragement, and hope. The vbry sphere which emanates from such a nurse and friend or physician, if it cannot call back the angel of health, will soften the approach of the messen- 4 ger of death who stands in waiting. *    Xk    +    +     * I have enjoyed a few warm days here--have even walked on the beach once or twice, but the air is growing chill, or my blood is growing poorer, and my pule feebler. I do not think I shall stay much longer. I have seen the ocean and been lulled by the music of the sleep- less tide-ebbing and flowing, resting never. The sight of it is glorious. I -have rejoiced to behold it, but I am more eager now to return to the quiet nook which I have so long called "my home." When the woods change     244    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, their mantle and the leaves fall, I had rather be there. I have had a hope all along, which grew stronger as the time of William's promised return drew near, that we should have some tidings of him. I cannot say that I have lost hope now, but it is overbalanced by fear and dread. Yet I think hle lives. I cannot explain the feeling- or account for it, but I think he is alive and sometime will return, but perhaps my eyes will never behold him. Emily is improving in health, grows stronger, and al- though very sad, evidently makes great effort to attain cheerfulness. Yesterday, when we were alone together, she alluded to the incident I related to her a few weeks ago, of my last meeting with T--  at this place. "You look back upon it as the turning point in your destiny," said she. "I wish you would tell me, if you can remember, whether you felt strong or weak to meet the future then." I told her, as well as I could recollect, my feelings. She sighed and said: "I believe I am almost wicked, but lately I have felt so weak to meet the struggle of life, that I almost long for death." "That is wrong, Emily, but not unnatural," said I. "There are periods in the lives of many young people, traceable sometimes to one cause, sometimes to another, when they believe themselves to be too unhappy to live, and think they long for death. But let us look at it rationally a moment. Let us ask ourselves, What is this death for which we sigh? We cannot escape from our- selves in this world or the other. We sigh for rest and peace, but it is a boon we must earn before we can enjoy it; and when we have learned the secret of its attainment, we shall be in heaven, whether in this world or the other. Take courage, my child, and hope. It is not in this place or in that place--it is not to the past or in the future, that we must turn for help and strength; it is in the present.   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 245 God is no nearer ius after we pass from earth, than he is here in the midst of our toils, and cares, and hopes, and fears. When we really believe this, we shall not know what it is to be alone in our struggles." *    *     o         I  We were all gladdened yesterday by the arrival of Mr, Herbert. Kind, affectionate, genial Mr. Herbert! He brought us tidings of ally our friends. Lizzie's school flourishes, and her health and spirits improve. She will succeed and be happy yet. Lucille's marriage is soon to take place. Her father sanctions the engagement, and all parties seem well pleased. Rosalie, poor child, is in the greatest distress. Hearing nothing from her brother, she fears the worst. Mr. Herbert tried to induce her to come to us for a while, and thinks she may yet do so. The little Willie's grandmother is dead, and the grandfather is so infirm, that it is thought he cannot long survive. A niece, from New Hampshire, is at present with them, and takes care of the house and the little boy. Rosalie has been to visit them, and only that she had not the heart to take the little boy away from his grandfather, she would have brought him home with her. She says he is all left to love that belonged to her dear brother. We were all strengthened and refreshed by the presence of Mr. Herbert. We had talked so much about William, dwelt so much on the uncertainty of the future, lingered in such sad communion over the past of our acquaintance- of all the happiness we had found in his society, the hopes centered in him, the love we bore him, and the visions we had painted of his future, that our daily life had become morbidly sad. Of course, Herbert can say nothing to remove our anxiety, but the presence of a good man, strong-of faith, and full of Christian love, is like wholesome medicine to a mind diseased. He is one of     246    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, those men that a woman loves to lean upon. He takes, too, such a cheerful view of things--not only able to say "all is right," but to assure us that he feels it. He says we all are a little too apt to hug our griefs and to make a merit of our sorrows. We virtually say to ourselves, it is a tribute due to those who once enjoyed life with us, that we should not enjoy it when they. are gone. But what is it to enjoy life? What is the highest enjoyment of the soul? Is it not thankfulness for blessings and for the capacity to enjoy them? Is it not to receive the love of God into our hearts and to impart it to those around us? And is his love less, when he sends us trials, than when he bestows what we call blessings? Spiritual bonds cannot be broken. Our friends are not lost, although with our mortal eyes we can see them no more. "But it is the terrible uncertainty," said Mary, " the possibilities of hardship, of suffering, of butchery, of those horrible details which we so often hear of in ac- counts of Indian massacre. These are worse than death. These are what haunt us with regard to poor William. It is not that he may be dead, but he may be, at this mo- ment, tortured by a living death, and longing for those whom he shall never meet again." "My dear Mary," said Herbert, "I understand it all. Suspense is the most wearing of all grief, if we suffer it to be so. We cannot reach that point of trust that we can rise above it wholly. But we can hinder ourselves from dwelling upon possible scenes of anguish and suffer- ing; and this is the duty we owe to God and each other." Emily was not present, and he spoke of our cares for her in this respect: She is young, untried, feeble. We must be strong and cheerful for her sake. The question then arose again, Does she love him? Of this we, none of us, have a doubt now. But did he love   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE, 2a7 her? My opinion is unchanged, and they agree with me now. How could we ever have doubted I How other. wise could we interpret the nameless, indescribable some- thing in her expression-half thoughtfulness, half dreami- ness, that is the first awakening of the young heart to love. Mary says, this sad event must throw a shadow over Emily's whole future life. "Not so, Mary," said Frank; "you wrong the dear child by such a thought. Once to have truly and purely loved, although without its fulfillment of happiness in this life, is to have enlarged the capacities of the soul for eternal hap- piness hereafter. Bitter as the disappointment may be to her, yet spiritually her life is richer, higher, holier. But why should we give up hope? -William may yet live, may yet make his escape, surmount all obstacles, and return to us. Come, let us not exclude the light of the outer or the inner world," and he drew up the curtain which we had suffered to remain closed all day, and the bright rays of the afternoon sun, shone into our pleasant parlor, and the light of a brighter sun into our souls. Emily came down at that moment. She is able to walk now without help, but the injury to her spine has produced a slight deformity, and a weakness from which I fear she will never entirely recover. Herbert greeted her with a smile, and all of us looked so much more cheerful; in short, there was so much more health, and hope, and trust in our sphere than there had been, that she seemed to imbibe its benignant influence. "Put on your thick shawl and bonnet, and we will walk," said Mr. Herbert, and she seemed glad to do so. We saw them from our window standing on the beach-he so fatherly, so strong, so tender in his love-she so full of all feminine gentle- ness and grace, leaning on his arm, and both gazing over the broad expanse of ocean, when a golden path of rays     248    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, seemed to stretch from them to the very portals of heaven. The evening we passed together-all of us together. My husband and children, Mr. Herbert, Mary and her little folks, and Emily. It was the happiest evening we had spent for some time. Although I expect to meet you in a few days, I must write of what has befallen since I sent my last letter. You know we had all been made better and more cheerful by Herbert's presence. Not that we had no more sad misgivings or painful memories, but we were lifted out of our gloom-we were elevated and felt stronger to meet, and to bear trial. The younger children had gone to bed. The rest of us had gathered around a bright, blazing wood fire. It was a blustering night with- out, and the hoarse murmur of the waves mingled with the rushing of the wind, and made us think of the poor sailors on the coast. We were just bemoaning the necessity of separating for the night, and dreading to leave the comfortable fire, as Mary rose, and going to the piano, sang that exquisite air-"Rocked in the cradle of the deep "-in which Herbert and my husband joined. Alas! I could only sing in spirit. We had decided to leave the day after to-morrow. My husband and myself to, go back to our pleasant valley with the children, and the rest to stay awhile in Boston, previous to' returning to their western home. I thought, during the singing, I heard a light tap at the door, but not being sure of it, I did not interrupt the music. Just at the closing word, as Mary rose, the tap was repeated, and Herbert went to the door. There, in her traveling dress, all in a tremor of excitement, stood Rosalie, holding by the hand little Willie. She threw herself into Mary's arms, and could not speak for weeping. None of us could say a word, we were so   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 249 startled--so taken by surprise--so overwhelmed at sight of her. Herbert took Willie in his arms, and was about to close the door, while Mary tried with trembling hands to undo the fastening of Rosalie's shawl, when she rushed past us, and the next moment William stood be- fore us. He came to me, grasped my hand as he said: "You see I have not forgotten my promise." "Nor I the conditions of its fulfillment, William," said I. "God bless you." The next moment I turned to look at Emily. I was just in time to beckon to Herbert, whose arm saved her from falling, as she must have done, overcome by sudden faintness. William, Rosalie, and little Willie! Was it a dream I No, they had arrived at that moment, had inquired for our room, and come directly thither. None of us could speak-we had so much to say--and so we voted not to ask any questions that night. To make ourselves per- fectly sure that we were all wide awake, Mary insisted that William should give his hand to each in turn. A timely draught of water and a whisper to Emily to try and recover herself, brought her into the circle, but Oh, how she trembled'! How pale she looked! I pitied her. I knew it was one of those intense moments when joy is so unreal, so bewildering, that it amounts to pain. I drew her to me and kept my arm around her. I could almost hear the beating of her heart, as it came our turn to grasp the hand of him, who to us had 1" been dead and was alive again t"It was not the grasp, when he took hers, but it was the look that accompanied it, that spoke volumes- that made her turn first crimson red, then deadly pale. He held her hand. He pressed it in both his own. I could feel how she trembled. We gathered round the fire again. We called Willie from one to another, caressing him and     250    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, asking him questions. Then we sat down and only looked at each other. "What is to become of us if we sit here all night?" said I; "for see, our last stick of wood is on the fire!" "Emily, my child, you must be the first to depart," said Mary. It was a wise suggestion. I knew how she longed to be alone. Rosalie declared it was cruel to send her away, but we insisted that we knew best. "To-morrow we can meet and talk it all over," said Mr. Herbert, putting a candle in Emily's hand and kiss- ing her good-night at the door. Springing up, my hus- band went to secure rooms for the new-comers. William followed and then Herbert, leaving us women alone. Rosalie took the little boy on her knee, and we all drew closer around the dying embers. We kissed the little fel- low. Tears came to our eyes in spite of ourselves; but they were tears of happiness. "Thank God, you are here!" said Mary. "William is safe!" "He came only last week," said Rosalie. "Oh, he has suffered so much! But it is all forgotten now. He found Willie with us. I had just brought him home. His grandfather died, and we could not think of allowing him to go with his aunt to New Hampshire. He had been with us only a few days, and we all loved him so, and felt so sad too, when we looked at him, thinking of his poor father, perhaps dead, perhaps wandering in all sorts of dangers. Don't you think he looks like William?" She did not wait to hear our answer, but ran on: "I was wretched till I took the child. Then I thought, I shall have something to live for. William's child will   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 251 be a new tie to life. My brother came in upon me just as we came upon you. We could not believe our eyes. He was overcome at seeing us. He wept so over the child. He had only been at home a day when he pro- posed going to you. He had promised, he said, the last of September to meet you. We urged him to stay a few weeks to rest and recruit, for you see he is shockingly travel-worn and broken. He will tell you of all he has suffered. It is incredible how he could have escaped. But he would not stay with us-he would come, and said I must go with him and take Willie. So here we are, and I know you are glad to see us both. I have not been so happy for many a month. But we will not talk more to- night. I must put my boy to bed, and we ought all to rest. But first, let me speak of Emily. How changed- how sick she is! how very pale!" "Yes," said I, ' but she is getting better daily." "I hope so, for William's sake," said Rosalie, tenderly. "I believe he loves her-has always loved her. I have so much to tell you, but there come the gentlemen. To- morrow seems an age away; but good-night." So say I to you, Margarette, good-night. The excitement of the evening, and the startling sur- prise that the sudden appearance of our dear young friends gave us, was a little too much for my weak nerves. I could not sleep, but wandered in imagination to that fu- ture, which, I trust, they will live to enjoy, long after my eyes are closed to earthly scenes. I felt happy for them. I did not need that any one should assure me of their mutual love. I read in that one look of William's, all I had so long believed, and more of the true state of his affections, than he could ever have told me in words. Why he had not seen fit to manifest it before-why he had     252    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, been so freaky as to absent himself for so long a time, and brave the perils of that terrible expedition, was the mys- tery that troubled my nightly meditations. This, however, is solved after a fashion now, but like many of the vagaries of lovers, seems to have had very little reason in it. As I did not go down to breakfast, Mary came to my room, and we had a quiet hour of talk, while the young people were together in the parlor. After Rosalie and myself had left last evening, William signified to Mary his desire to have a few words with her, and our consider- ate husbands left them together. The result of the inter- view, was a complete avowal of his long cherished love for Emily, which he said he had not dared to hope would receive her sanction, while, at the same time, he could not but cherish the hope, that Emily was not indifferent to him. He had never, he said, declared his affection to its object in words-partly from a consciousness of un- worthiness, partly from a conviction, that his unsettled habits of life, his apparent want of a definite purpose of action and ability to pursue any object steadily, detracted from Mary's estimation of his character as a man, and would mIke her distrustful of his power to render any womancha py. He had so often heard her say, that in order tothe highest capacity of a woman's affection, a man musthe strong, self-reliant, and everything else that was lofty, at least in aspiration ; that feeling himself but half a man in these qualifications, and conscious that his powers were wasted on mere abstractions, that in reality he did nothing, and could not even decide upon one thing that he could do better than another, he lived on from day to day, not willing to risk the possibilities of a disappointment, and yet, not being able to determine in what way to prove himself worthy, when suddenly he   THE EVBRY-DAY IFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE.  253 received the astounding intelligence, that he was to be deprived at once of the presence of his idol, and the hope of ever being, able to win her for his own. He felt sure that it was to remove her from him, that the sudden de- termination of departure from home was made. He be- lieved that Mary had observed his growing interest and disapproved it, and wished by her abrupt departure to put an end to any expectations he might hitherto have indulged. He interpreted it as a delicate, but peremptory manner of expressing her disapprobation, and accepted it accordingly. The few words he had been betrayed into saying- expressive of his interest in Emily, were not so * strong as to receive the depth of the sentiment he cherished 'for her, and he had not even dared to believe that they were thus understood by her. He saw that during the time which elapsed between the announcement of their depart- ure, and its actual occurrence, there was an evident de- sire on Mary' spart, that all opportunity for a private inter- view with Emily should be avoided. Nothing remained for him but to acquiesce-to banish her image from his heart, until he could think of her -only as a friend and sister, which months of weary separation, danger and hardship had not enabled him to do. Nor had he in all his difficulties and- distresses, lost the hope for which alone he desired life, and by which he was able to endure, to struggle, and finally to overcome the barriers that se- parated him from the object of his earnest attachment. And now he had come to ask of those who knew her worth, permission to try and gain her affections. He did not care to have the past explained. Whether his con- jectures had been right or not, he did not even ask at present. He made no promises about what he might do or become, to be worthy of her. He felt that with such a stimulus to exertion, all the good within him must be     254    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, developed, and to live for her happiness was all he asked. How Mary replied to him, she did not tell m.. She gave him her sanction and her blessing however, to which in spirit I add mine. If he had confided all this to me some months ago, you perceive, he would never have played that desperate game. The headstrong folly of a man in love, whatever course it takes, is perfectly incom- prehensible to a looker-on. If he was in doubt how his suit would be received, why did he not satisfy himself by a plain home-question, and not go a thousand miles round to return at last to the same point from which he set out? O pride, pride! how out of place it seems in our dealings with each other! Truly love must delight in obstacles, if it will go out of its way to find them-and all the while he was periling life and limb, among wild beasts of the forest, and wild Indians of the prairie, his image was cherished in the true heart that loved him alone. About dinner-time I made my appearance below in a tasteful wrapper and my new cap with pink bows. I saw from the windows a group of our own people on the beach. Herbert and Mary walking to and fro, my hus- band and the young folks bobbing up and down among the rocks, and scrambling about in a most extraordinary and venturesome manner. It was a superb morning. A sort of shadow flitted across my soul as I thought it is the last-the last time my soul shall ever look upon this glorious landscape through mortal eyes. Afterwards, I was glad the last should be so bright and glorious, and the shadow passed by. It was only a cloud between me and Heaven. I went slowly down stairs. Just as my hand was on the latch of the door, I heard low tones in the room I was about to enter. Had I been younger and stronger, I might have retreated; as it was, I was forced to enter. Two happy faces shone upon me. I was made   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 255 to feel that my presence was not unwelcome William drew my arm in his and led me to the sofa. "My dear children," said I, taking a hand of each, " what can have happened to make you both look so very satisfied I" I suppose it was a sort of awkward shyness, joined to my childish love of mischief, that made me ask the ques- tion, but it strangely belied my real feelings. But I can never grow old, and sometimes have a provoking double consciousness, which prompts me to manifest the very opposite of what I feel, possibly to prevent the exposure of emotion, which, if indulged, might go beyond bounds. But when I looked first at one and then at the other of my young friends, and felt the pressure of their thrilling hands in mine, I said to myself, "What signifies it at your age, and with one foot in the grave, to try and joke' with these happy souls!"Could anything I might say- could my sympathy with their happiness, paint the rain- bow of their hopes, with deeper tints, or add sweeter per- fume to the roses that bestrewed their path And yet, was I not nearer Paradise, nearer the Eternal Spring of life than they were? Did I not know from the Heavenly Oracle, that this prophecy of bliss now sounding in their ears, was an echo of the Divine Harmonies to which our being is attuned, and which Infinite love will sometime awaken in all their rich and endless combinations I, too, had known the rapture of such an hour, when the rose of youth bloomed on my cheek, and the pulse of health danced through every vein.. Through vicissitude and trial, and heartache-through joy and sorrow, the words of that prophecy still resounded in my soul-True love is immortal, unchangeable. Through whatever sorrows, and darkness, and adversity, it will not perish; it cannot be lost. Therefore be happy, young, ardent, trusting ones. Be happy without fear, only forget not     256    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, Him, from whose infinite love floweth this fullness of beatitude into your souls. These thoughts passed through my mind, crowding upon me so fast that I did not speak for some time. Wil- liam was the first to break the silence. "Why could you not have Spared me the ordeal I im- posed upon myself?" he asked' "One word, from you, would have been enough, and yet you withheld it." "Ungrateful boy!"I replied. "Did I not, in every way that real friendship -to say nothing of womanly curiosity-could dictate, try to gain your confidence, and you would not be persuaded to trust me? Did I not point out the folly of your joining that silly expedition, and advise you to go eastward instead and did you not refuse to be advised-headstrong, that you were-perverse, self- willed, proud, and everything else that is provoking?" "But one little word of encouragement would have changed my course at once," he continued. "And by what right do you suppose I could have spoken it?"I asked, assuming a righteous indignation. "By whose authority? What reason had I, or any one else, to suppose this little girl cared for you Surely she never spoke to me of her preferences. It was not my part to seek to penetrate her maidenly reserve. In a mat- ter that concerned your happiness so nearly, it would seem natural that you should interrogate. And how did I know you loved the child?" "You must have known it," he replied. "Mrs. Herbert must have known it, and she -Emily--ah - yes -she knew it. She never doubted. God bless her! But how much I have lost! This is the bitter drop in my cup of happiness now; the thought that all might have been mine months ago! So much bliss is lost from my life, and nobody held me back!"   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 257 "Held you back, William!"I exclaimed. "You strong, brawny, willful man Who would think of hold- ing you back, when you were determined to go?" "And yet, how little would have sufficed!" said Wil- liam, looking, at the same time, at Emily. "How little?" she repeated, scarcely as interrogatory, but rather as an echo of his own words. "One such look, one such word from you; one passing emotion of regret, at parting," said he, fondly. "But she need not reproach herself, Mrs. Dearbon. In truth, I would not have had it otherwise. I am glad that I can- not say of the bliss of this moment, 'It was'-of this assurance, so lately spoken, and which I make her repeat over and over again -' six months ago she spoke those sweet words that I cannot hear enough.' To me there is no past now. The present is enough." What malicious spirit stirred the depths within me, as he said these words, "For me there is no past A"And yet, within that dark domain she dwells to whose ear that voice was divinest music-to whom those words of love once were life-Mabel, Mabel! But I rebuked the spirit, and the vision of the "child-wife" vanished-not in dark- ness, but in glory. The light of that world where she dwells, who was thy heart's first love, William, is never dimmed by selfish longing. We cannot penetrate these mysteries of our being. Our human nature is too imper- fect. She is happy now. Be thou happy also. Yet say not there is no past. Let rather the memory of its joy, of its love, of its sorrow consecrate the present. I knew my presence was not unwelcome, and yet I felt I had staid long enough. Those words, never said too often, must be repeated over and over again-as they could not be repeated if I were by. Besides, I found myself growing serious and thoughtful, and I wanted to be alone. 22     258    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, "There is," said I, rising to go and looking at Wil- liam-" there is something firmer than the everlasting hills, and I am glad you have no further need of proof." ' He answered by a grasp of my hand. Emily blushed crimson, and hid her face on my shoulder. I pressed her dear, shrinking form to my heart. It beats yet-thanks to the kind Father!-with human sympathies. If there is an hour in mortal life, whose intensity of happiness will live as long as the soul's consciousness, it is that, when the heart that loves first feels it is be- loved. The memory of that hour in my own life, was the key which admitted me into the sacred temple of their happiness. I could only say, "God bless you both!"- and remembering that I had left my knitting up-stairs, I made a timely exit. William insisted upon giving me the support of his arm in ascending the stairs. "If anything could make me happier, than to be assured of her love, it would be your sympathy, to whom she is so dear," said he. "You have it, my friend," said I. "My heartfelt sym- pathy-my blessing on you both!" To-morrow I must leave our happy friends for a while. How glad I am that I leave them so very happy! But two days ago, it was an effort to wear even an outside cheerfulness, the habit of anxiety was so strong upon us. Why will we not learn trust even in the darkest hours  It might have been otherwise. William might not have returned; but firmer than the everlasting hills, stronger than human affection - stronger even than death is His infinite love, who is above all.

I thought it would be coming home to die. And although death seems no nearer to me, than when I first came here, to you I may confess, however, that I am growing weaker, and I have a presentiment still that I shall never leave this spot, until called to the unseen land. But if I should be able to go back in October to my western home, I shall feel that " it is well." It will be lonely for my husband and children to go home with- out me. Yes, they will feel heavy-hearted at my loss at any time; but by-and-by the Comforter will come to them. In labors of love and thoughtfulness for their father and for each other, my children will find true hap- piness. Mary and her party remained at Boston, but will pass a week or more with me before their departure for the West.- Possibly we may all return together. I miss them hourly. I should like to be an eye-witness of the bliss of my two young friends. Emily's delicate health is now William's greatest anxiety. His tenderness is beautiful. The little Willie is, of course, the pet of the family. He is a glorious little fellow. I can see something of his mother's expression in his face, although his features are more like the father's. Gentle Mabel, loving, and tenderly beloved. Is she forgotten? How like a dream must his early love seem to William now. These autumn leaves are falling over the grave of his wife, far away. I was about to say, how sad! but I was wrong. The heart of youth must have a living, present object for its love. Sad and lonely his life would be without a home. A few days ao an old fend of y mot A few days ago an old friend of my mother's called     260    ThE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, upon me.  She had met my children returning from school with her own grandchildren, and learning whose they were, was impelled to call on me, as she said, for my mother's sake. They had been young together. They were married about the same time-they had been mem- bers of the same church, and she was one of the friends who stood beside my mother's dying pillow. I was glad to see her; yet her visit left a painful impression for a time, that I could not shake off. She belongs to the rigid sect of Puritans, whose ancestors were among the first settlers of this New England town. There was a pre- cision, a formality in her manner which chilled the free expression of my feelings. She had heard that I was a consumptive and not long for this world, but evidently thought, by my manner and appearance, that I was igno- rant of my real situation, and the near approach of death. It certainly could not have been owing to any frivolity or lightness of manner; it must have been from the cheer- fulness with which I spoke of things appertaining to life. She did not mean to be obtrusive, but could not rest easy until she had obtained, by a series of close questions, my confession of faith. Now, you know, religious discussions have, from time immemorial, been distasteful to me. Not that I am unable or unwilling to give a reason for the faith that is in me. Not that I have no reason to give, as some may suppose, from my dislike of argumentation; nor is it that I am only a negative receiver of the doc- trines by which I hope to have arrived at truth. No one can love them better, rfo one can attach higher importance to them. They are, indeed, my life. On them are based my hopes of happiness here and hereafter. By them I have sought to know how to live, and in them I am wil- ling to die. It is because they lie so near my heart that I am unwilling to drag them forth for discussion, and   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 261 seek to explain them merely to satisfy the curiosity of another. I had lapsed, in her opinion, from the faith of my fathers, and was spiritually a cast-away. She wept over me-abjuring me for the sake of my mother-for the sake of the blessed Saviour who died for me, to lay hold on the faith by which alone I might hope to obtain salva- tion. She asked me if I had any objection to her offering up a prayer. Of course, I had none, and she bowed her aged limbs in my presence, and prayed the Almighty, before it was too late, to save my soul and sanctify me through the truth. There was a touching earnestness in her appeal and in her manner, which moved me to tears; but my faith is too firmly fixed to be shaken now. When she arose I thanked her, but I could say nothing more. I should have loved to talk with her about my mother's early life, her last ihours, and many things relating to her. It would have been sweet to refresh my memory with her image, and have the dim outline filled out by one who knew her so intimately. I had often been told of her spotless life and peaceful death, but I had never asked her creed. I felt that her hope and trust was mine: that she had gone before me to our common Father, and it has long been one of my sweetest anticipations that, when my spirit first enters upon its untried life, she will be near to welcome me: I shall not be alone. It is a hard faith that would destroy our trust in a good Father, and place on the throne of the universe an arbitrary-an inexorable judge. I had not the strength, even if I had felt the wish, to talk much with my aged friend. I thanked her as cheer- fully as I could, for her kind concern in my spiritual wel- fare, and told her that, what had been truth to me in life, I felt would not fail me in the hour of death, and that with a heart willing to be taught of God, and trusting in     262    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, his infinite love and wisdom, I did-not fear to rest my hopes of salvation with him. He who had guided me thus far in life, had given his promise never to forsake those who put their trust in him. Her visit was kindly meant, but I hope she will not come again.     *    *    *    *  We are all together once more. The days are soft and balmy, and the forests are gorgeous in their autumn drapery. My husband gives me a drive every afternoon. I enjoy more than I can express. We talk of the fitwre as if there were an earthly future for me as well as for him- self I say nothing to remind him that it cannot be, for I know he does it consciously. He does not, cannot dwell upon the thought that I must leave him. Nor need he. It would not help him to bear my loss, and it would take away from the joy of the present. So we speak of what is to happen, of the children, and of our hopes and fears for them, as if we were to watch their unfolding life to- gether. So I believe we shall. Mary is busy preparing her little folks for winter. Emily and William have the world to themselves: the world of reality and the world of dreams. The rose has come back to the fair cheek of our darling, and her strength improves daily. Yet we still fear she will never be vigorous and strong. The beautiful proportions of her figure are lost, but she does not seem deformed to us. She is transformed by the pure soul which shines through her whole being. They will be married as soon as Mary is settled at her own home. *    *      *       * Do you think it possible that I can be getting well? after having made up my mind that I must soon die, that I may dare to entertain a hope of recovery?

He always talked of getting well; always said he thought he was a little better. None of his friends undeceived him, and he was never brighter or more cheerful than the few days that preceded his death. I thought, when I saw him last, what a beautiful and kindly provision it is of our heavenly Father, thus to soothe with hope, the long and wearisome months of a lingering disease. You recollect how it troubled the conscientious clergyman who visited him during his illness, that he did not seem to be aware of his actual condition. But his sister, who knew him better than any one else, insisted that he should not be dis- turbed. I remember what she said. "Why should we trouble him? I know that he does not dread death, nor fear to meet it, although he loves life and enjoys it. It anybody ought to enjoy life it is he; and, indeed, for such as he, there is no death." He was not a man to talk much of his feelings, his hopes, or his fears-not even to those he loved best; but he needed not to speak in words: his life was its own interpreter. The evening before he died, he was bright and cheerful, and more tender than usual, particularly to the children, his little brothers and sisters. After an hour of delightful communion he retired to rest as usual. Early in the morning, as was her custom, his sister, his sole nurse, went in with his cup of tea which he took in bed. No hand was out- stretched to clasp hers-no voice spoke the morning wel- come. The hush of death was in the room. His spirit had passed away, all bright and warm and glowing with its purified human affections, into the bosom of the Infin- ite love. At first, as she afterwards told me, it gave her a shock to find him dead. The thought that he had died alone was painful. This, however, was but a momentary pang. As she stood gazing upon his noble features, so     264    THE OLD aORWNE CUPBOARD; OR, serene, so majestic in their calm repose, she saw in spirit a vision of angels, which seemed to say, "Why seek ye the living among the dead?"She never felt afterwards, that he had died alone. Hearing her speak thus of him and his last hours, I said within myself, How beautiful thus to die In my secret heart I prayed for just such a death, and I ahve felt an inward assurance for some time, that so gentle would be the approach of the death-angel to me. And yet I do not feel to-day, nor have I for some days past, any tokens of his coming. Can it be possible that I am getting well? that I may yet pass years in this beautiful world with my loved ones that I may watch the develop- ment of my children's characters-share with my husband his toils and joys-live to be and to do something--to find out my own capacities, and to use them to nobler purposes-live to realize some of my best dreams I Who knows  Not you-not Hbut God, the good God. He knows, and I can wait. I will at any-rate improve the time and strength I have, in your behalf. I know you love to get my letters, and to read them; and I know I love still more to write. Since you cannot be with us all the time, I will keep you informed of our doings and sayings. To return then to our domestic details, I will relate a little conversation we had, the other evening, about our friend Mr. Rochester. He is not yet married, although I predicted he would not endure a long engagement, which proves I am not always, in such affairs, a true prophet. Rosalie says he is a daily visitor at their house, and always punctual to tea. She learned the other day from an old resident, who knew him years ago when he Was a gay young man in society, some particulars of his life. Handsome, she declares, as Adonis, but so wild, so extra-   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 265 vagant-his father could do nothing with him. Of course, there is but one satisfactory solution of the problem how the change was brought about, which.,transformed him into the Mr. Rochester of our acquaintance. What makes the crusty old bachelors and unhappy old maids in the world? Crosses in love, is the reply, stereotyped ages ago. This it was, in truth, which changed the current of our reckless young hero's life, and made him what he is, or rather what he was a year ago. He didn't take the disease kindly, and it left him terribly scarred; but the scars, after all, are only skin deep. Now that he is filled with happiness in the widow's genial society, he looks a score of years younger. Happiness is the best cosmetic. Well, to go back in my story, Frederick Rochester, young, handsome, gay, and rich, fell in love with a poor, simple, uneducated little cousin of his-beautiful as an houri, but fickle as the wind. I think her name was Bertha; I shall call her so at all hazards, for Bertha sounds rather capricious. She was a distant relative, whom he had never seen, until she came with her mother to his father's house. Old Mr. Rochester, learning the misfortunes of his kinswoman, offered her a home, little thinking of the syren who was to charm away his son's reason and judgment, and finally destroy his happiness. They came. The mother, to assume the care of the house, which had been left to take care of itself since the death of Mrs. Rochester, and the daughter, to bewitch her gay, young, spendthrift cousin., How he fell in love, desperately, madly, as Rosalie says, with the beautiful Bertha-how his father stormed about it awhile, and then gave up, because he saw 'twas no use trying to dam up the swollen torrent of his impetuous affections-how she seemed to return his passion-all this you will find recorded in the chronicles of true lovers 23     WS6    THE OLD 0ORNER CUPBOARD; OR, throghout the world. How he promised to sow his wild oate and be a steady man, and swore that what he had needed heretofore, was such an angel to guide him; and how his friends were compelled to acknowledge that, after al it was the making of him, this bondage of heart and soul to the wily little god-all this you can compare with the records of your own observation, and you will appre. eliate our hero's position. But Bertha was too pretty to be unobserved - too fond of admiration to be willing to bloom in the quiet nook of a secluded country home. She went to church, to singing-school, to village parties and festivals, and a great many young men, besides Frederick Rochester, contrived to tell her by word of mouth, or sign of some kind, how pretty they thought her; and her own glass told her the same story many times a day. Still Frederick seemed to be the chosen one. Her mother impressed upon her the fact of her cousin's nice property-rich father-great expectations; and these were weighty considerations: for the truth must be told, she had no heart-she was nothing but a weak, vain, frivolous, coquettish little beauty. Affairs went on, however, smoothly and pleasantly between them, till sud- denly, by one of those mysterious turns of the wheel, which nobody expects, there came reverses to the family of old Mr. Rochester. Some business house, in which the greater part of his property was invested, failed and his large fortune was lost. He bore it like a man, for he was a man. He had made his money, and had known what it was to work hard. A small competence remained, barely sufficient to enable the family to live respectably; and Frederick was compelled to do as his father had done before hiin-seek his fortune. He went into business, through his father's influence, in one of our large cities. He had an object whereby all toil was sweetened. Bertha   THE EVEBY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE.. 26 was the pole-star of his ambition. For her he labored to be rich--labored hard, indefatigably, unremittingly, and successfully; but just as the summit of his hopes was gained, and buoyant with expectation, he was preparing the home for his fair bride elect, he received a letter from his father, that his angel had eloped with a young South- erner, and was on her way to his plantation in Georgia. Imagine the downfall of his hopes.! Imagine the shock to his pride and his affections! Nothing could be done, however. She had left him voluntarily-was the wife of another. The future was a blank to him. Nobody could offer him sympathy, for his nature was too proud to desire it. He threw up all business, and off he went on a voyage round the world. The only relief to his despair seemed to be in constant change. Storm and tempest, danger and hardship were congenial to his perturbed spirit. He was gone a long time. What he suffered, no one ever knew, but he lived through it, and came out of the con- flict stern, ascetic, joyless, as we knew him--the very antipodes of hiq early manhood. Firm as a rock, he set himself against the evils of society, the pomp and cir- cumstance which attend wealth, the abuse of power, the corruptions of party. But the one great curse of slavery was the chief point of attack. The very names of South- erner and slaveholder stirred the depths of his indigna- tion. He refused all terms of brotherhood with them. Doubtless, he thought a true feeling of philanthropy lay at the bottom of this deep aversion. Far be it from me to probe the old heart-wounds now. He had no reason to look with charity on southern institutions and influ- ence. But I honor his principles, and will not question his motives too narrowly. Few of us could stand a close scrutiny of motives. I hope, through his labors and sacrifices, the blot upon our country's escutcheon is,     268    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, dimmed, and I know many a poor fugitive may thank Mr. Rochester that he is a free man. I hope he will not relax his efforts now, or forget, as he sits in his easy-chair gazing, as I have no doubt he does, on the widow's fresh- complexioned, kindly-hearted face, that " the trail of the serpent" still lingers in Eden. Rosalie says he is really lovable, that all the young folks are won by his cheeriness. I always felt sure he had a heart, and I am glad it is thawed out. The philan- thropy of the head is like the sun in winter-light without heat-but the philanthropy of the heart will gradually melt away all evil and prejudice. But good-by, Mr. Rochester. If you had your life to live over again, with your present experience, I am sure you would not let the fickleness and caprice of a weak girl make your best years miserable. How differently trials affect us! Speaking of trials, reminds me of a letter I received, yesterday, from Lizzie-a sad letter. She feels alone with all of us gone. She shrinks from making new friends, but dreads more the thought of returning to her old ones. How long it may be before the dove of peace broods over the troubled waters of her soul! How sad is the picture of her past life! What though I tell her to look not upon it, repeating to her again and again, what I have so often been compelled to say to myself: "Let the dead bury its dead!"It still sounds in her ears like a- mockery. How can she forget, when the very effort to do so, forces her to remember? After all, how little we can help one another to bear sorrow! We hold up to our stricken friends the feeble lamp of our experience, pointing out this and that path which seemed, as we trod it, to bring us nearer to the source of peace. We point onward, where the Eter- nal sits enthroned, and say: Strive ,pward, be strong, be hopeful, be steadfast! and even while we are speaking,   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 269 our own feeble footsteps totter-the distance between us and the heights to which we aspire, grows immeasurably far off; as we gaze upon it, shadowy apprehensions of unknown dangers in wait for us, fall dark over the way, and we can only say, Let us kneel together-pilgrims as we are--let us trust to the arm that never faileth, to the love that never sleeps. Where is all our boasted self- reliance when the heart is overwhelmed? Humility is forced upon us in the hour of sorrow. It is not in rest- less striving, any more than by patient waiting, that we attain to heavenly states. I remember how goaded I was by the advice, constantly repeated and kindly meant, of a friend who, in order to rouse me from a condition of mor- bid depression, said: ' Do something--think of some- thing else-don't dwell upon your feelings." How I tried to obey! How worse than fruitless was the attempt! "Do something." Yes, do your duties, bowed and suf- fering one, mechanically. Move your arms, use your fingers, walk, work, tire yourself bodily, as thoroughly as you can. Your friends tell you not to think of yourself, but try and get up some great interest, some enthusiasm about something; take up the study of some science- some foreign language; the more practical and philan. thropic of your acquaintance say, go and visit the poor, and sick, and suffering, and you will come back grateful for all your blessings. Try these remedies, one and all, they will do no harm; but there are, believe me, many spiritual quacks abroad in the world; don't think you can be made whole at once, or by any great specific of man's invention. The best advice is that given by the old bear to his little one, who complained that he could not go alone. "C Stop thinking, and walk." Yes, it is worth every one's-while occasionally to stop thinking or trying to think. Be contented to exist day by day, and ask only     270    THE OLD CORNER OUPBOARD; OR, for your " daily bread". Your soul could not digest more god-like fare if it was offered. Take your daily bread and try to eat thankfully, though it is dry enough to choke you. You may moisten it with a tear or two sometimes, but that will not make it less nutritious, though it may not be quite so palatable. You are out of sorts, sick, un- sound, and you must be put on diet. Don't try to dis- cover whether the soul makes the body sick, or the body the soul, for this only aggravates your disorder. When you are well, it will be time enough to dive into the mys- teries of being. Be satisfied for a while, to believe that the Lord, who made you, knows all about these things. Leave yourself in his hands, and be patient. By-and-by, as God liveth, from out these wrecks, this disorder, this confusion of elements will arise a new Heaven and a new earth. Some faint ray shines through the darkest gloom from the light beyond. Follow it, steadfastly, patiently. It will guide you to the only true source of beatitude. No matter what theologians may preach, never mind the disputes of learned doctors of Divinity, follow the little light you have, step by step; walk in it, act according to it, and by-and-by, if you " do His will," you will know of the doctrine whether it be true or not. I told Mary the other day that I did not expect to wit. ness the much-talked of wedding. She hopes otherwise. A momentary pang shot through me, as is the case some- times, when I think of leaving my husband and children. I spoke in the fullness of my heart, when I said, "You will love those I leave behind, Mary?" She burst into tears. It was then my turn to be com- forter. "Do not make me weak, dearest friend," said I, "now, when I wish to be most resigned. Let us talk together of   THE EVERY-DAY LFE OF EVEBY-DAY PEOPLE. 271 our past friendship. How great a blessing it has been to both of us! How much, how very much we have en- joyed! I see you so happy in your husband and your children, in your hopes and anticipations for Emily and William, and I share with you all this happiness. Our dear children will grow up together. I am satisfied to know that you will love them, that you will comfort them and their dear father, and I believe I shall not be far from any of you. I think we are spiritually allied to each other. I hope none of you will mourn for me. I could not go in a better time. I have no anxieties, not even for my children. Nelly is so womanly, so efficient, so unself- ish, Katie will look up to her and yield to her judgment. They will be companipns for their father." "But I shall miss you, Alice," said Mary, "oh, so much!" While we were talking, the children came in. I saw  that Nelly observed Mary's eyes-yet red with weep- ing, and as I rose to go to my room, she followed me. "Mother," she asked, "had Aunt Mary been crying? Has anything 'happened to Emily and William  I thought we were all happy now." "And so we are, my child," said I, pressing her to my heart; "so we are. Sit down by me and I will tell you the cause of your Aunt Mary's tears. You are no longer a child." She laid her head upon my bosom. I kissed again and again her fair forehead. I knew that what I was about to tell her would wring her young and tender heart, and I felt that I had not courage to do it; but after a silent prayer for strength, I said to her: "Nelly, dear, I shall be with you on earth but a little while longer. I am going to our Father in heaven-to my loved ones who are already there-my mother-my little boy-'my early     272    THB OLD COW= CUPBOARD; OR, friends-and when I am gone, you must be the com- forter-the helper--the friend of your father and sister." How she wept-clinging to my neck and sobbing as if her heart would break under this, her first sorrow, I cannot tell you. But the struggle is past, and now she is calm. She does not wish to leave my side, nor do I send her afwray from me. I am able to talk cheerfully and hopefuly with her. But the buoyancy of youth has given place to the thoughtfulness of the woman. I am so glad you have made your arrangements to come to us soon. I hope nothing will detain you after the appointed day. The weather is still mild and Indian- summer like, and we cannot bear to think of moving away from here at present. Herbert is in Boston on business, and will come home (we call this home now) next week. My husband says he can, without inconve- nience, stay until later, and that if I continue as well as I am at present, I shall even then be able to travel to a milder winter. I was sitting in my own room yesterday, before dinner, quite alone, having sent Nelly to walk; I am obliged to send her from me or she would never leave my side. I try to convince her it is a sacred obligation to take care of her health, without which she must fail of the highest usefulness to others. She had been gone but a few moments when I heard a light tap at the door. It was William. "I have come purposely to have a talk with you," said he. "I have waited for an opportunity several days, but sometimes you look so pale and weary, I am afraid to press my claim on your sympathy, and sometimes I am too much engrossed with my own happiness. Yet I have much to say to you-many questions to ask that no one, can answer as well as yi L   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF- EVEBRY-DAY PEOPLE. 273 "You have chosen precisely the right moment, Wil- liam," I replied. "I am neither sick nor weary now, and my heart is always ready to sympathize with you in joy and sorrow," "I do not doubt it," he continued; " but I am not so selfish as to make too large a demand upon your time and strength. Do you remember," he asked, as he seated' himself on the sofa beside me, " the day you told me I should yet awake to the high purposes of life, and feel it was a great thing to have lived and suffered " "Yes, I remember it well,William,"' I answered. "And you believe it now. I am glad to have lived long enough to witness the dawn of this new life-to see you so happy." "I am happy, Mrs. Dearbon," he said, with feeling. ( I am very happy. I feel sometimes that I do not de- serve so much--that I am not worthy that she, who has never loved before, should love me so well. I have told her all the past, and--" he hesitated. "She loves you the more for what you have suffered," I added. "That is woman's nature." "I should not have said that," he replied; " it was not the thought I intended to express, but it is true, as you say. Woman's nature is compassionate, unselfish! I meant to have told you that I concealed nothing, not even the errors into which I was betrayed by my own headstrong passions. I wish her to know me, not only as I am, but as I have been. Above all things, I wish her to believe, that however wild, lawless, impetuous I may:have been, I was not guilty of willful unkindness or neglect. I am aware that- in some respects appearances were against me. My letters to Mabel were intercepted. Had they not been, she would never have undertaken her perilous journey in search of me."-     274    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, "We knew this, William," I answered as gently as I could, for I saw he was very much agitated. "Not one of those who know you, ever believed that you were guilty of willful neglect. All your youthful errors are long since forgiven and forgotten." "I thank you," said he, earnestly, " and most of all, I thank her, who, with a thorough knowledge of the errors of my past life, is willing to intrust her happiness to my keeping. The sufferings I have endured help me to feel the sacredness of the trust she reposes in me, and will instruct me how to guard her tender heart from every pang that human love can anticipate or avert. I do not feel that I am less worthy of Emily for having passed through a bitter experience, or, for having been taught by unavailing repentance for the past, my highest duty in the present. In the first transport of happiness, when after our long separation I returned to find a welcome so sweet-so unexpected-and to learn how fondly and faith- "fully my memory had been cherished, I remember to have said in your presence-' For me there is no past.' I saw the shadow that flitted across your spirit. It changed in a moment the expression of your face. I knew you were thinking of Mabel." "You are right, William," I replied. "I did, for a moment, almost reproach you in my inmost heart for being too much absorbed in the present-for having forgotten-" "You wronged me, my dear friend," said he. "I did not ort the past. The memory of Mabel is sacred. It was thelangers which I had escaped in my perilous adve tures to which I alluded. I saw, in a moment, you had misunderstood me. I said, within myself, ' Mrs. Dear- bon thinks I have no right to this new-found happiness."' "You do injustice to my feelings by the supposition,   THE EVRY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 275 William," I replied, seriously. "On the contrary, no one rejoices more in your joy than I do. You are young: long years of life are before you: I would not have you live without a home, without affection, without living objects to bless, without those incentives to manly exer- tion which God has appointed as the safeguard of virtue, and the sources of our highest spiritual good. You wronged me, William. Long, long before you had acknowledged your attachment to Emily, I looked for- ward to this event, as to one in every way desirable." "You do not think me heartless and false, then," he said, with emotion. "Yd believe it was not by pre- meditated unkindness, not wholly from selfishness, that my unrestrained passions beguiled Mabel's gentle heart to take that step which ended in sorrow to so many, and brought her, poor victim, to an early grave. At least you think that years of remorse and unrest may, in part, have atoned for my faults. You believe that if she had lived, the devotion of my life would have made her happy. She is not forgotten. Emily knows that she is not forgotten. My short married life seems unreal as a dream, but when I look on my boy, how can I forget his mother? Emily would not wish it possible that I could forget. She, too, loves the child for Mabel's sake, and I love her the more for thus loving him. I can talk to you in this way. I could to no one else. You have been a mother to me,and Mabel felt that she owed you every- thing." "My son," I said, tears almost choking my utterance. "My dear son, you have my heartfelt blessing. You will be happy, calmly, rationally, virtuously happy. For her sake who looks up to you, be strong, be steadfast, be a good man. Let not the sorrows through which you have passed, the faults into which you have been betrayed,     276    THE OLD CORNER OUPBOARD; OR, fail of their appointed ministrations. I have passed through many trials, seen many changes; I have lived as not every one lives among their fellows, for my heart is closely knit to humanity, and the joys and sorrows of others I cannot help making my own; but the nearer I draw to the unseen shore, while my spirit seems almost to catch some rays of its celestial brightness, and to look with a calmer gaze on human life, on God's children, the more clearly I see that there is but one path to true hap- piness. You know what I mean/ William. It is a straight and narrow path, often wearisome of ascent, hedged in by difficulties and dangers, but it leads upward to the peace we all covet.'?- I asked his permission to preach a little, which was granted. "It is not presumptuous in me now,:' I continued, " to say that, what once appeared dark and mysterious in our human relations, is revealed now in plainer characters to my mind, and I seem to myself to have come into closer spiritual communion with my kind, and to be drawn to them more tenderly by sympathy with their struggles and their sorrows. I wish, at this moment, that I had the eloquence and fire of a Seraph, that I could express what is stirring the depths of my soul as I look at you, and try to picture the future that lies before you with Emily as your wife, whom I believe you love most tenderly." "God knows how tenderly!" he said, "and I hope wisely." '"You will let me speak, I may never feel like it again," I continued, and he encouraged me to go on. I don't know how long I talked or exactly what I said, but I tried not to abuse my privilege. It chafes and ex- cites me sometimes that I am nothing but a weak woman, so hampered and fettered by want of words (notwith-   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE.  2" standing that our sex is accused of having the 'gift of tongues" by right of inheritance from our much-abused mother Eve), that after I have been talking ever so much in earnlest, I have only succeeded in puzzling my listeners without convincing their-intellects or warming their hearts. "I falter, William," -said I, " when I think of the im- mense possibilities of happiness or misery that lie before you. It may seem a light matter, if among the myriads of human hearts, whose great want cries out to their Maker and Father, two beings are wrecked in hope and happi- ness, and their lives a failure; but it is not so. God knows how sacred one human life is, and we all feel, in spite of our inflated philosophy or false theologies, that we have a right to the care and protection of the Being who made us." I found he agreed with me thus far. "I said to you a moment ago, you remember," I con- tinued, " be a good man, and I did not mean be a great man, as the world counts greatness; I did not appeal to your ambition, to your pride of intellectual or social pre- eminence. These are but servants of the Master who calls for your life's devotion. All God's gifts are but means bestowed for the attainment of the highest end of life, goodness- holiness: and if the wish, you just now expressed to make Emily happy, came from the heart, if it is indeed your earnest purpose, it will be its own fulfill- ment. No matter what the externals of life may be, if the wife whose deepest yearnings are for something to reverence, to look up to-if the true woman, to whom has been granted the keenest appreciation of the 'beauty of holiness,' can rest secure of this in the man she loves, though robbed of everything else, she will still be happy in her choice." I knew well, and I said plainly, appearances seemed     278    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, to contradict my assertion. Many women are unhappy who are united to what the world calls good men; but what the world calls good men are often, no more than negative, inoffensive, weak characters, who lack even the vim to give a zest to evil. Such are not the men I mean. Many women also are unhappy with- oat knowing why, and are always looking to externals for the root of the evil which is hidden in the human heart. Others are aching with a vague yearning for something, they know not what. They have not studied their own natures, they are restless, vacant, objectless. They say, "It is because we are defrauded of our rights, we are slaves, we are but half developed, our sphere is too limited." All this is true, and much more. The wrongs are deeper, the rights more lofty than any that have yet been disclosed, that belong to women. Granted all the privileges that so many women claim, and are they satis- fied-are they happy? Oh, no! the want lies deeper still. She has the right to expect to find somewhere, out of herself, the wisdom, the strength, the holiness that can call forth all her capacities for reverence, admiration, and love, and without this the marriage relation is no true type of spiritual union, no reflex of the Divine mar- riage of love and wisdom which is the very sphere of Heaven. This, or something like it, I tried to say to William. "I am trying to follow you, my dear friend," said he, half seriously, half playfully; " but you know I haven't got up yet so high in your divine philosophy. But don't despair of me." "No, indeed, I shall not despair of you or of the world in general," I replied. "But can you not see, even with your limited vision, how such true marriages, as I have hinted at, would transform our world into an Eden V"   THE EVERY-DAY LIE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 279 ' I can discern but dimly.," said William; " but go on, I'll follow thee."' "I hope you don't mean to insinuate that a ghost is beckoning to you, although, if-I work myself up into any great excitement, I shall be in danger of being consumed bodily by my fervor. One thing I do wish, William," said I; c; that I could live to see the end of these agita- tions which are going on in the world." "And woman triumphant, as she deserves to be," added William. "Now be serious," I added, "for I am so. Let me tell you, conservative as- you are may be, I am glad that society is stirred up, although 'things rank and gross in nature' may be brought to light. It is better that the evil should come out in all its blackness before the eyes of men. After the storm and the earthquake have done their work, those who really love truth and goodness will hear the still small voice saying, I This is the way, walk ye in it.' I see you are tired of my preaching, and I for- give you, for I know what you want." He evidently thought my feelings were hurt by his not replying to what I had been saying; but he was mistaken. I was not so unwise as to expect he would feel as I did, or if he understood me ever so well, I knew he could not quite overcome that shyness which young people, par- ticularly young men, have about talking sentiment or religion. "I have listened to every word you have said with my whole soul, Mrs. Dearbon," he added after a pause. "I feel it is all true, and I thank you for having said it." "And now you wish to hear me talk about Emily,'1 I continued, " and I will gratify you. Ask any question you choose, and I will answer it to the best of my ability.     280    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, "Talk about her, that is all I want," said he; "you cannot wear out the subject or repeat anything too often. I wish to hear all that has happened since I left you- everything she has said and done." I opened my eyes in amazement. "The history of a young maiden's life for a twelvemonth, with every parti- cular of word, look, and action, even to her dreamt, I suppose. This history to be delivered extempore to her enamored swain, with occasional interludes of sighs and exclamations, the entertainment to wind up with a grand triumphal symphony." "The 'Rogue's March,' flourish, and exit," added William. "With Bengal lights, as accessories, rose-colored and blue," I added. "The morale, a grand blow up and crash in which the fine fabric, woven of lovers' hopes, is entirely consumed; the lovers themselves, seen afterward in the common day- light, nothing different from men and women in general." "To begin then and improvise a little," I said, "please open my desk and bring me two little sketches you will find there; or if you choose to keep them you may do so, pro- vided I am not obliged to explain to your matter-of-fact comprehension what they are intended to represent." My back being turned, I did not see him look at the pictures. "Are they mine? Were they intended for me?" he inquired eagerly. "Do you recognize them?"I asked. "To-be-sure I do," he answered earnestly. "They are like and not like. The outline is capital. You have given just that turn of the head, a little to one side, and that wave of the hair is perfect, so is the curve of the shoulder. Mrs. Dearbon, you are a genuine artist, or else you were inspired by your subject. Which is it?"   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVER-DAY PEOPLE. 281 "I am a genuine artist, no doubt; and was no dotibt  inspired when I made these sketches," I answered; "but are you sufficiently en rapport with the original or with me, to comprehend them? One, you observe, bears the date of the 10th of June. She was sitting by the west window of the parlor, where you have often seen her, and been perhaps almost as near her as you were at the mo- ment this was taken." "Nearer, I trust," said William. "At least more hap- pily conscious of my propinquity." It is not personal presence that intensifies the com- munion of souls," said I. "Oh! that is as you fancy," replied William impa- tiently. "I have not reached that climax yet. I want the reality of a living presence: the eye to answer my glance, the lips to--(I spare you thus much), the warm hand to return my clasp-at least to feel it. I am not satisfied to embrace a shadow." "Away with your materialism," said I. "You have yet to learn that what you, in your ignorance, call 'fancy,' is in truth the highest philosophy. But I shall not under- take to convert you. To proceed with my explanation, and I beg of you not to interrupt me until I have finished. You see I have sketched her very imperfectly as she sat looking off into the distance, her glance apparently rest- ing on that bold sweep of hills that skirts the western horizon. For my own part, I doubt whether she saw any point in the landscape 'Her eye was with her soul, and that was far away.' Of course, I could not give the dreamy expression to the face which it actually wore, because no human artist, not even the most gifted, can paint thought, or hope, or love, or the prophecies of youth. But you can fill up the Out- line to suit yourself." 24             - to!     282    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, "It is very curious," he said musingly. "There may be some truth in your fine-spun theories. The tenth of June-I can recall the day perfectly. We had crossed the Missouri. The main body of our party was to go north, while the remaining twelve, myself among the number, were to set out the following morning in a westerly direc- tion, with an Indian guide, to obtain supplies of game, return again to the fort, and remain until the rest of the party joined us. I had a strange presentiment of evil, and felt unaccountably gloomy. I was half-tempted to turn back, but decided it would be cowardly. How vividly I can recall the picture! The magnificence of the scenery! There is nothing like it, I am persuaded; nothing so grand, so vast, so sublime in its vastness as the boundless West! The afternoon was glorious. The sun set in a flood of golden mist. I think I could almost have written poetry, but I am afraid if I had done so, it would have been too sentimental for the popular taste. My thoughts traveled to our own pleasant home. I was with you-with Mrs. Herbert, with-I may as well con- fess it-with Emily, and I should have been very glad of your faith in spiritual presence at that moment, I assure you." "It is the fault of your willful blindness if you cannot believe it," I said; " but let us turn to the other picture which bears, you see, a later date. You perceive a few lines written with a pencil on the margin. These too need an explanation to your matter-of-fact comprehension. 'Although life looks very dark to me now, I know that by-and-by it will grow bright again, not with the same, but with a holier light-more subdued, but more steady and serene.' We had been talking together-Emily and I-not of herself but of myself. I had been telling her something of my youthful experience. We were at the   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 283 sea-shore. We had heard of the terrible fate of Captain Grey's party, and feared that you were among the number of those butchered. After I had told my story, Emily fell into a silent, sad mood, and I took up my book, not to read, but to conceal what I was doing, for I was trying to sketch her face with its changed expression. We did not speak to her, at that time, of you. We had never ques- tioned her of her feelings for you. We saw she suffered, and we divined the cause. I had just finished this imper- fect outline as she looked up and said those words. I have transcribed them, not because they are in any way origi- nal or striking, but because they show the spirit of self- renunciation she manifested at an age when the yearning for happiness is strongest in the human heart." I did not watch William's face as I spoke, for I saw he was deeply moved, and I did not wish to appear to observe more than he chose to betray. "I am not worthy of such a spirit," he said, after a pause. "God grant I may become so. I look back over these years in which I have done nothing or worse than nothing, and I ask myself: How can I repair this waste of my faculties--this absolute squandering of time? I know love does not exaggerate the beauty of her charac- ter. On the contrary, I feel hardly capable of appreciat- ing her as she deserves." I smiled at his earnestness, and it vexed him. "I see you do not enter into tny feelings," he said. "You think me extravagant." "No; you are mistaken," I said. "I don't know why I smiled. You must forgive me." "I wish to make her life happy, Mrs. Dearbon," he continued. "How can I do it? How can I make my- self worthy of her confidence She is deceived in me. She has idealized me. Sometime she will awake from     284    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, her dream to find me a creature full of imperfections, inconsistencies -worse than that--full of faults. I have told her so, but she will not believe me." "I will assure her you have told nothing but the truth," I said. L Perhaps she will believe you are a monster, on my authority." "Do not joke with me now, Mrs Dearbon;" said William earnestly, " or I shall think you are tired of hearing me talk." t"Go on, my son," said I. "I love to hear you talk, but I thought I was going to cry, so I turned it off with a joke in which there was no heart at all. Go on, William, I do understand you." "Emily thinks," he continued, "( that I am a religious man. That humbles me more than all the rest, for I am not what you or she understands by a good man. I have no creed. I am of no church. I believe in no doctrines. I have no clear faith in the future. I wish to be all. you say I ought to be for her sake, because I know she looks up to me, she wishes to look up, and to be guided by me as one stronger-more self-reliant than herself. I hope she will not find herself wholly deceived. So help me God, I will strive for higher objects-I will make my mark, and she shall yet live to be satisfied with her choice-to be glad at heart while she walks by my side, and to feel her pulse beat faster when she reads on the list of those who have labored for the good of their race, her husband's name." t"God bless your resolves, William," I said; " it would not be a true and holy love that unites you, if it did not nove your religious nature to high aspirations. You will be happy-she will be happy in your affection, proud of her choice-satisfied-I am tired now, and you must go away. Do not fear to trouble me at any time if you   THE EVERY-DAY LE Ot EVBY-DAY PEOPLE.  8$ desire to talk to me, and let me see' you bothiar maci as you can, the little time you are?here." After he was gone, I could not help falling into a fit of musing. I was glad he had opened his heartAto me, for i knew it was a relief. To no other one except Emily could he speak so freely of the past. Can the heart love truly more than once, I asked myself, as I eat thinkiug of the young wife buried far away among the hills? I aIm glad the question is not left for me to decide. It is -not for me to speculate, to theorize, to compare, to judge another. I can rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those that weep, wherever they are. I know some natures require present objects to loe, yearning for the endearments of home, for wife, children and friends-they wither when alone. "God setteth tihe solitary in families,') and I do not look upon such natures as any less angelic for being so truly human. How wearied was my head with thinking, and my heart with feeling!- How little excitement I can endure! Oh glorious immortality beyond this fitful life! Wonder. ful are the depths yet unexplored- of the soul's eapacity for happiness I To give forever of the fallness of thougaht and love, and forever -to drink in new supplies from the Infinite. Once I thought, if it should be but a dream-- this hereafter! If this life were indeed all!: May God forgive me for the shadow of doubt which hid hisl good- ness from me. I believe his words now who says, ( Whosoever shall drink of the water that I shall giw him, shall thirst no more forever." My chamber is in the wing of this old-fashioned hous, and from myI window I can look directly into-asry's room. The other-day, while taking my invalid priilege of doing nothing, I sat watching my frienid, seated at htr     THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, writing table-now leaning her head upon her hand, and looking up-now writing away for dear life. I verily believe it is the book! I mentally exclaimed. She has actually begun her novel. When we met at the din- ner table, I could not resist throwing out a gentle inuendo. It was in vain she held up her finger, I felt so mischiev- ously disposed, that I pretended not to see it. "Tell me," said I, " have you written the first chapter? Is it in prose or verse, and did the divine afflatus come down through those old-fashioned mouldings on your ceiling?" I had contrived to awaken curiosity throughout our little circle by this time, and Herbert was more eager than any of us to know what it all meant. "I never can have a secret," said Mary indignantly. "Nobody ever need hope to conceal any corner of their soul from Alice, and what she thinks she knows, she always tells the whole world. Whose affair is it, if I am writing a book ? Haven't I as good a right to appear in print as any one ? Who dares to say I am not competent  Did I not pass among all my friends as a genius long ago? Were not my poems published in the most transcendental magazine in the Union, and were they not pronounced inimitable? Who, of the uninitiated, ever dared to say they were able to comprehend them ? And now have I not earned my right to be called an author? Yes, I have begun my book. I did not begin with the first chapter, I went into the very heart of the story at once-into the very center of the plot, and I intend to work it out to- wards the circumference. Herbert, that is the orderly way isn't it ? Isn't it the way to .put-boloopwarmth in it? Yes, the divine afflatus did come through the old mouldings, and filled the room where I was writing, and to punish your curiosity, Alice, ' shall not read you a word of what I have written. I intended to have paid   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE.  287 you a confidential visit this afternoon, and brought my work. Now, I shall do no such thing. I shall shut my- self up, and write all the afternoon." " You forget you are engaged for a drive this after- noon with me," said Frank, "and that reminds me, there is a button off my coat, which you said you would sew on, as I shall need the garment in the cool of the evening." "Mr. Herbert," said Mary, looking very indignant, "do you really think that I can descend from the heights of inspiration, to sew buttons upon old great coats ? or take homely drives, in a wagon, with nobody but my husband? Are you aware what it is to be inspired? Are you conscious of the honor in reserve for you ? To be the husband of Mrs. Mary Herbert, author of ' Wo- man's woes,' 'Heavings of the heart,' 'Soothings of sympathy,' and 'Martyrdom of married women ?' Will not your heart glow, when you see hung up in all the great Bookstores everywhere, a card printed in large black letters. 'The great book of the age.' 'Sixty thousand copies sold in less than three minutes.' 'Increasing demand, for the popular Novel of the day.' Can you anticipate the pride you will feel when the 'Sensation book of the season,' is in everybody's mouth, and you hear everybody asking, 'who is the author,' and you know all the time who it is-the woman who honors you with the title, ' husband '"' "See the children open their eyes," whispered William to Emily.   They can't decide whether their mother is joking, or in earnest." "Will you put us in your Novel," asked Nelly ? "You shall-go out this afternoon, to collect incidents, which is far better than gathering wild flowers, or dried leaves," said Mary. "You must find some ragamuffin      288    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, children, with gaunt faces, whom nobody claims, and who are sent into the world half-grown without any his- tories, just on purpose for authors to take up, and make up, and contrive a past and future for. Put on your bon- nets, this minute, all of you, and run up and down until you find somebody miserable enough to figure in a book; and be sure that they have great black eyes--deep set- with dark rims round them, like your uncle Herbert's shell-bowed spectacles." "I think that little Irish girl, that came here yesterday, will do," said Katie. "I met her crying in the street, and asked her what was the matter. She said her mother had given her a three-cent piece to buy soap, and she had lost it. I had ten cents in my pocket, and gave it to her. Our landlady says it is an old trick of hers to be losing three-cent pieces. It supports the family." "My dear," said Mary, " poor people, who send their children out to buy soap, will never do to figure in a modern novel. To have the least suspicion of cleanliness connected with them, puts them at once, out of the pale of our sympathies. What a momentous task is ours!" exclaimed Mary, with a groan. "To labor for such a stupid,--unappreciating world. But I will show it up. I will hold the mirror up to nature, that it may see its stolid front as it is." "What a bon-bon for critics your book will be, Mary!" said Frank. "I think it will be very much like the pill all sugared over, that a certain young Munchausen said he put in his mouth, in a fit of desperation at being refused by the lady of his love. The nature of these pills is to melt away to a certain point, (he is my authority for this statement), when they explode, and blow a person quite up out of their misery."   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE.  289 "And did your friend take one of the pills "I asked, very much interested. "To-be-sure he did," replied Mary, " and went to sleep with it in his mouth, waking just the moment before it was ready to burst, repenting and spitting it out at the same time. It exploded on the floor, and our hero is re- served for future exploits." "His heart as sound as ever," added William. "Just as sound, and I fear, no sounder," said Mary. "But come, Frank, when the horse is at the door I shall be ready to drive with you, and I will fasten your buttons on for the present at least, until I see how my efforts to elevate the world are appreciated, because if through the stupidity of the public, I am suffered to remain in obscu- rity, I do not think I shall have the persistence to fight against circumstances." When the various members of our little circle were scattered-the children for their ramble in the woods, the lovers to their cozy retreat in the west parlor, Herbert and my husband on their respective missions--Mary and myself were left vis-a-vis at the table. Mary was the first to break silence. "I am  sorry, Alice," said she, "that you joked me about my book. Although I spoke at first in joke, I have since seriously considered the matter, and I actually made a beginning this morning. I had not told Frank anything of my plan, partly from shyness, and partly because he professes not to like female writers. He says women can do much more good, and exert a better influence by living true lives, than by their written thoughts and experiences, and besides he says, when people begin to take upon them- selves the office of teacher and preacher, they are very apt to deceive themselves into the belief, that because they have a clear insight into truth, and are able to elevate 25     O0     THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, their understandings into its light, that, therefore, they are living according to its requirements. No truth is really a part of bts,' he repeats over and over again, ' that we do not make our own by living it, and one genuine truth brought into act, does more to establish our own spiritual life, and to elevate that of others, than the per- suasive eloquence of the most transcendent intellect in the world.' I admit that he is right, in part. I feel it here, in my heart, which his example has animated with, at least, a warmer love of goodness than I ever had before I knew him, and yet, I do not wholly agree with him. Our perceptions of truth and duty are often vague and shadowy to ourselves, and by the intellectual effort of clothing them in words, to make them clear to another's compre- hension, they become realities to us. Our heart warms in the contemplation of the virtue we have tried to depict-we feel a new impulse stirring within us, to strive after perfection. The glow of enthusiasm may subside, but the warmth that kindled it is not extin- guished." "How hard it is to keep 'heights which the soul is competent to gain!' "I exclaimed. "I am afraid, Mary, we sometimes mistake the nature of this enthusiasm, you speak of. Step by step, in renunciation, we must travel on, and only as self is put off, can the Divine be put on." "But would you have us plod on the weary way un- cheered by any foretaste of the glory beyond?" asked Mary. "Must we always be looking where to plant our feet, and can we never forget that we are chained to mortality?" "If we soar so high as to forget it sometimes, we are brought to acknowledge the fact so often," I replied, "that the easiest way, it seems to me, is to begin with   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 291 the acknowledgment and rise gradually and by sure degrees, toward the glory. You may call me in your heart, a clod. I know you think me uninspired at this moment; and yet I speak as I feel. We must-look on the dull earth of duty and self-sacrifice, if we would follow our Master 'in the regeneration.' We must be led like him, into the wilderness to be tempted, and if like him, we can overcome, angels will come and minister to us, as they did to him. Then we shall not need to look out of ourselves for the peace or the joy we covet. 'The kingdom of heaven will be within us.'" "Alice, I believe you," said Mary. "I know, from ex- perience, that what you say is true. I have been all my life long, trying to bring up my flagging mortality to the mount of inspiration, toward which my eyes were directed. But I was not content to get there step by step, as is ordained for us all. I wanted to make a flying leap over the heads of the groveling multitude. Sometimes I thought I had succeeded. Sometimes I really believed I had glimpses of the promised land, but the earth-mists came up cold and damp, and hid it from me, and the wings of my spirit were weighed down and would not bear me up again. Yes, it is best to keep our feet on the earth, though our head may be in the clouds sometimes." Dear Margarette, you and I know how vast is the dif, ference between aspiration and action, between assenting to, and living the truth. When the heart is warmed through with the beams of the spiritual sun, the path of duty will no longer seem difficult and stony. Out of the ground will spring forth everything beautiful and fresh; for then will open the soul's summer, warmed by the love of the good Father. "I will not finish my book just yet, Alice," said Mary. "I believe it will not be just what the world needs. I     292    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, don't think people want more light; they have enough to blind them now, and they need to learn how to use it. You have made my heart a little heavy, but I shall pluck up courage and hope by-and-by, and go on, step by step, as you say I ought to; but, thank God, I do not travel alone, I have always a great, good friend near to urge me on, and show me the way, and point upward to the Friend and Father of us all." Mary and her children are making their last prepara- tions before departing for their western home, and soon will set out on their journey. They come to me every morning with a smile like the sunshine, and ask how I feel to-day. I have not been as well for a week past, and I know they are anxious about me. Herbert cannot be absent from his business nmuch longer, still they are un- willing to think that they must leave me behind. A few days will decide for them and for me. If I do not get better I shall grow worse rapidly. If better, I shall go with them, if not, they will remain with me a while longer. I feel how it will be. I hope, for their sakes, I shall not linger long in helpless weakness. I, too, have been preparing for my journey home. The Lord forgive me if I have some natural pangs at leaving this bright world and the kind hearts so endeared to me. I have been looking over old letters, and destroying them ruthlessly, except a few which I have laid by for my children to read. I was sitting by my table, surrounded by papers, piles of letters, and rolls of manuscript stories- Alice Dearbon, the authoress -pondering in my own minid, whether I should, with "one fell swoop," hurry them into the fire, when Mary and Emily came in. "Shall I, or shall I not ." I asked, holding up a roll of foolscap, closely written and tied with a bit of red tape.   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 293 "Burn them 2. exclaimed Mary. C' Never! Give them to me--all of them. They shall be published." "Beware!"I said, " you have never read them." "But I have read you, and I know that whatever you write is an impress of your own thought. For that reason, if for no other, I will cherish and preserve them." How blind affection makes us! thought I; but to for- give is very sweet and very easy. "1 wonder, indeed," said I, " how I ever came to fill so many sheets with my own childish feelings and fancies. You -dignify these, my lucubrations, by calling them amy thoughts. I appreciate your esteem; but, my dear, I never knew how to think. Nobody ever taught me, at home or at school. I lived in a world of feeling and im- agination. I am afraid the capacity of thinking never belonged to me. Mr. S--, of unenviable memory, my cross-grained teacher at -- academy, put me in Euclid, as a mental discipline; but to this day, I have not been able to discover even my need, much less how it was to be answered by solving geometrical problems. I never got over The Bridge, which might, if crossed in triumph, have revealed intellectual wonders to me. A ' Bridge of Sighs' it was to me. I went through volumes of intellec- tual philosophy-I studied logic, I learned grammar, and parsed Young's 'Night Thoughts' successfully, went through Colburn's ' Sequel,' (but I am very sure I could not go through it again); all this I did, to learn how to think. After I got older, I read history and moral philo- sophy, reviews, and critiques, still in the hope of finding out the art of thinking. But I am persuaded, my province is not in the department of intellect. It always produces a confusion in my brain and gives me a headache even to try and think. Lately, I took up a book on the Science of-Thinking. Somebody, who had never been able to     294    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, think when he was young, I suppose, not only doubted the wisdom of all teachers and all books, but declared, modestly enough, yet with a sort of oracular persuasion, that he had discovered a new way of thinking, the only true way, and an infallible way beside. 'Now,' said I to myself, 'just as my poor mind is on its last legs, here is somebody that might have helped me to go without crutches. Nevertheless, I will see what he has to say, perhaps I can yet have time to do up a deal of thinking by this new method, and leave behind me some tokens of having had, originally, a thinking principle, which, owing to the stupidity of those who had charge of my education, was never developed.' I seized upon the book with childish eagerness. I read it. I found that, accord- ing to the author's theory, thinking was intimately con- nected with breathing. I began a series of experiments in order to bring my wind apparatus into subjection to my intellectual faculties, or vice versa, I didn't know which. I did not understand exactly how it was to be done; not having learned the art of thinking by any for- mer method, I could make no practical application of what seemed a necessary preliminary. I went on with a series of experiments, holding my breath, or tacitly breathing, that is, breathing with an internal breath, now breathing long and deep, then quick and hurried. From being an unconscious operation of my physical organiza- tion, breathing became a study. I was convinced it was a science, the science of all sciences, if one could only get the clue of it. In the very midst of my pursuit of know- ledge under difficulties, the cook, whom I had trained to know my way of doing things exactly, left me, and I was obliged to serve in her capacity, and leave my scientific investigations. I found that my thinking principle was sufficient for common-place purposes and for the essentials   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 295 of animal life, without which the breath would soon be dissipated, and as I had not, with all my assiduity, accom- plished anything for my poor head, I made up my mind that I was too old to become a strong-minded woman, and as none of my friends complained of me, I wouldn't trouble myself with any new-fangled notions about breathing or thinking, but go on in the old way, trusting to my intuitions, and by way of mental exercise, jumping at conclusions, skipping over arguments, dodging to keep out of the way of trains of reasoning, which, in this age of mental power, is as much as a poor woman, who never graduated at any female college, could be expected to do." Emily laughed while I was talking. I knew she was congratulating herself, that in this age, when women are so rabid to know everything, there was one example of a middle-aged female content with knowing nothing. She was of a nature to understand me. Yes, my little blue-eyed girl," I said, drawing her towards me (I love her as if she were my own); "yes, Emily, never mind all this fuss about culture, and intel- lect, and equality with mankind. It may do for some people better than for you and me. We were not made for it. Not that we are stupid! Far from it. There is something of more value than book-learning. Life brings it to us, experience teaches it- sympathy with our kind -fervent aspirations after goodness-love our beautiful social relations with their thousand springs of happiness-duty-self-sacrifice- faith in God-trust in goodness -delight in beauty - and deeper than all this, the alternations of a higher life with the interests, and hopes, and fears which belong to this - these are God's teachings;-to understand them is wisdom. And here," I added, opening my desk and taking from it a bible-the     296    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, one you gave me the night of my marriage--( here, dear child, is a book of exhaustless wisdom. It was givenz to me on my marriage-day. I did not value it then as I do now, for it was a sealed book to me-I could not under- stand it. I loved it for the associations of my childhood that hung around it, for the mother's love which sancti- fied it, and for the dear friend whose gift it was. I have learned its value since. Keep it for my sake-read it for your own, and may it be to you and to William a mine of wisdom which will open wider and deeper through the ages of eternity." You will not reproach me for giving away your gift, Margarette, dear. I could not take it with me. I should not need it. "Forever, O Lord, thy word is written in Heaven" -the Eternal truth-God with us. "Let us, dear Mary, pass this evening all together in my room," said I, after a pause. "Nelly shall put every- thing to rights, and make it bright and cheerful. We will have a nice warm fire of wood, I will put on my new cap, and we will celebrate our child's betrothal." A bright idea flashed through my mind at that moment. Nelly's monthly rose was in full flower with a prodigality of buds and blossoms. "Go down now and let me rest," said I. Mary looked at the manuscripts. "I will not burn them," said I; "I will pack them all in a box and send them to my old friend Margarette Singleside. She will keep them forever. So go down, and after tea come again." They obeyed me. I called after them to send Nelly to me. She was not far away and was by my side in a moment. "You must twine a rose-wreath for the betrothal, Nelly," I said. "We are to have a party in my room, at which the bride will be. In Germany, you know, they   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE.  297 call two who are engaged to be married, bride and groom, and they celebrate the engagement by a little family festi- val. I dont know exactly what they do at these fktes, and it is of no great consequence. Twine the sweetest wreath you can for our dear Emily, and make my room as pleasant as it is possible to make it, while I lie down and rest;.' The child's heart was in her work. I could see her, with my eyes half closed, flitting about from place to place. I blessed her in my inmost soul. The wings of sleep brooded over me. How sweetly over my feeble frame crept the subtle influence! Rest rest-peace. Clouds seemed floating around me, golden clouds, like the autumn sunset. I db not know even now whether I was -sleeping or awake. I dreamed I was in heaven. The green carpet, which covered my room, was transfigured to a mossy sod, sprinkled with flowers. The golden core- opsis, like the eye of day, the sweet-pea and mignionette filled the air with their fragrance, and there amid the garden, weaving a wreath of many-colored blossoms, his eye roving from one to another, was my blue eyed boy- my first-born -living- glorified -an angel amidst the bowers of paradise.  I have found thee once again, life of my life!"I exclaimed, opening my arms. He lifted his face to mine, he threw down his garlands, he flew to me, scattering blossoms as he went, he nestled in my bosom. A   thrill of new life went through my heart-a voice whispered "and there shall be no more death--sorrow and sighing shall flee away forever and forever."  Was it a dream, or was I indeed in paradise? After I awoke I seemed yet to feel his dear head pillowed on my bosom.  "The shadows of the fitful fire-light" flickered on the wall- the cheerful glow shone over the waves of Nelly's brown hair, as she sat quietly by the fire,     298    THE OLD CORNER OUPBOARD; OR, waiting for me to awake. I rose refreshed. I had bathed in the airs of paradise. My life was renewed, strength- ened. But my letter is long enough, I will finish my sketch another time. I left off writing where I ought to have begun perhaps, but you would be astonished, not without reason, if at this late day, I should forget to be egotistical. After tea my guests assembled. My easy-chair was placed in front of the fire. My husband sat at the left of the fireplace, where I could look at him, and my children stood on either side of me. Emily and William sat, side by side, opposite my husband, and the little Wilhe was on his father's knee. Mary, Herbert, and their little folks were grouped together, looking so good, so loving and happy! It was my party! What a proud hostess I was! On the mantle before me Nelly had placed some dried leaves and autumn grasses and grains, which her sister Katie had gathered, and which she had arranged in a vase of home- manufacture covered with wood-mosses. Wreaths, made of the ground-pine, sprinkled with bright, red berries, decorated the walls and the few pictures we possessed. "All these grand preparations are for you, Emily," said I. "We are all met here to celebrate your spiritual marriage-your betrothment." "I do not see why the minister should not be sent for and make the two one on the spot," said my husband; to which others of the party assented. Mary remembered, at that moment, certain legal pre- liminaries, such as posting in the " meeting-house porch"' three weeks before the marriage, to give time for all objections to be made and removed; a necessity that we were compelled to submit to. I motioned to Nelly, who brought from a little closet the crown of roses and gave   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 299 it to me. I was just rising to go to my young friends, and William put up his finger by way of remonstrance. "We will come to you," he said, and drawing Emily's arm within his, he led her towards me. How beautiful she was, as she knelt down beside him-! His strong arm was around her--her eyelids drooped as he drew her closer, closer till her head rested on his breast. "Take the wreath, my son," I said, giving him the fragrant chaplet. "It is to you the roses of her life are given. You must giye them back in blessings." He took the crown of buds and flowers, and placed it on her fair hair, rising while she knelt still beside me. "Mine, in the sight of God, mine forever!" said he, solemnly. None of us spoke. Still she knelt. He took her hand that lay upon my knee. She lifted her eyes to his face. His were gazing upon her. She read all their meaning- all the love, the deep tenderness of his manly heart was written in that glance. Her eye turned then towards Herbert and Mary. "Mother!-father!-for you are mine!" she exclaimed, and she sprang to Herbert. He clasped her to his heart, and she wept on the breast which had sheltered her so long. I did not mean to have it a solemn feast, yet I saw we were all weeping--Mary, Herbert, all of us weeping, yet foolishy trying to smile through our tears, as if we were gay. But it would not do. We were happy, which is far better. We were all happy, each in our own way and with our own reflections. The path of life stretched out far into the future for all but me. But was I less happy because the angel of death stood in mine, with his crown of asphodel for my pale brow? No. I was not less happy, but mine was a more solemn joy than theirs. I thought of meetings, when my heart was young and     300    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, fresh-of love and hope, when the world was all too small for my soaring vision. I thought of an hour, long past, when my soul was wed to another's; and then I thought of partings-one after another--how they marked the trodden way with graves--yet I was not sad. Thank God! I can say, with truth, I was not sad. Surely it was not a dream, that meeting of yesterday. I feel it yet--his dear head upon my breast. I see it yet-the garden with its clustering flowers. It was not a dream- I was in paradise. My spirit drank of the waters of eter- nal life. I know not what death means. I looked around. Herbert still stood there, Emily leaning on his shoulder, and I could see the great tears gathering in his eyes. "Let us pray," said he. It was an echo of the voice in each of our hearts, that ached for some expression for their swelling emotions. There are moments when we can only find relief in prayer. We all knelt, and he prayed from a full heart that knew well to whom it could turn. How, in after years, will our happy wedded pair look back to this even- ing and bless it! I am sorry you were obliged to defer your promised visit after the appointed time. Last night I had a strange attack. I thought-all my friends thought it was the precursor of dissolution; but it yielded to timely reme- dies, and to-day I am up again in my easy-chair, but very weak. Hasten to me, Margarette. The time we can stay together will be short enough, even if my life should be spared longer than I anticipate. I remember, when I was young, hearing of the death of a dear schoolmate from whom I had been but a short time separated. I thought, had I been with her, could I not have sent a message to   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. S301 my mothert? Was not the wish natural? Was it alto- gether childish? I confess; whether childish or not, I have often since had the same longing. Have you ever felt it? Do you feel it now? Our dear M----, whom we both loved so well. She is there-in that other coun- try where I am going-not far off, as they used to tell us, but nearer than we think. I shall see her soon. Will she not knpw me! Will she not keep " the same beloved name?"Margarette, I shall soon meet her. We will talk of you. We will be near you. Trust me. Kind, good Margarette! How faithful you have been I How strong to help me in my weakness! How true to me in all my waywardness! We have never known any coldness-any wavering of our affections. Ours has been a true friendship. I thought to find others steadfast as you. I went among strangers, eager, earnest to make friends. I made them, but none were like you, Marga- rette. Come to me, dear, as soon as you can. I know I shall never write you another letter. I leave for you my old manuscripts. Do with them what you please. You know if I had lived, I might have produced something more worthy. But progress does not-end here. Farewell, my earliest and best friend--from ALICE. These were the last: written words of Alice Dearbon. The following letter is from our mutual friend Margarette Singleside, to whom I wrote, after hearing of our friend's departure, begging her to give me an account of her last hours.-EDrroR. "Alarmed by the brevity of my friend's letter and the indications of bodily weakness it betrayed, I went to her at once. I found her much changed, although those, who had been with her constantly, did not seem to detect the progress of her disease, and evidently thought she     Oj;    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD; OR, might live weeks and even months, and perhaps return, without injury to her health, to her home in the West. One glance at her features assured me this could never be. She knew it herself, and for her own sake rejoiced She had longed to die in her early home, although for the sake of those dear to her, she would cheerfully have returned with them, for she felt it would be sad to them to go back alone. "The last week of her life we were all with her. It was a happy week to us all. Those, who like her, had passed the first vigor of maturity, and to whom the revo- lutions of years seemed swifter and swifter in their descent, were comforted under her loss, by the conviction, that it could not be long, at farthest, before they should meet her again; and those to whom life and hope were fresh and blooming, felt their happiness sanctified, not diminished, by having the thought of that hour when the cherished ties of affection must be severed-brought home to their hearts. There was grief among our circle, and many eyes were wet with tears, when alone, which in her presence wore a cheerful and hopeful light. There was grief but no gloom among us. There could be no gloom while she was so cheerful. The last hour, so dreaded, and for which we thought we were prepared, came unex- pectedly to all. "We watched her breathing through the night, Her breathing soft and low- As in her breast, the wave of life Kept heaving to and fro.

We thought her gazing upon it; but   THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF EVERY-DAY PEOPLE. 303 "She knew another morn than ours.' "I recalled at that time, as I often have since in think- ing of her, many sentiments with regard to death, which she used to express in familiar conversation with me, and in her letters. Among them was this: 'I hope I shall die in the morning, and die without apparent suffering. I know that what we call the agony of death, may be a mere convulsive action, of which the departing spirit is unconscious. Still, I hope, for the sake of those who are near me in my last hours, that I shall pass away quietly, and leave no painful impression on their minds-particu- larly on the minds of my dear children. I wish to die in the morning for another reason. Imagination: peoples the dark with spectres and a nameless dread, which cannot be defined, but I have felt it, and know what it is. A shuddering, ghostly fear. I have felt it often, as a child- a sort of consciousness of the supernatural, of spirits hovering in the gloom. And then, one feels sadness so much more oppressive in the night-particularly the young do. Oh!. what nights of loneliness and grief I have endured in childhood! Do not let my children in- dulge in gloomy imaginations. Let them be early taught there is nothing to fears if their hearts are stayed on God. Teach them to employ their faculties for others. Teach them to be happy.' "Alice Dearbon was buried in the village graveyard, beside her mother. The sweethrier, planted by her own hands, entwines itself lovingly over her last resting- place." FINALE BY THE EDITOR. I was glad to welcome back the Herberts, Emily, Wil- liam, and all. Mr. Dearbon and his two motherless little girls went to their own house. Lizzie Cameron had been busy there for several days, making everything look     804    THE OLD CORNER CUPBOARD--FINALE. home-like and cheerful. The marriage of Emily and William took place soon after their return, and it was decided by all, as Nelly was young and inexperienced, that it would be a pleasant arrangement, and one condu- cive to the comfort and cheerfulness of all parties, if the married pair would take Mr. Dearbon's house, for the winter, and as much longer as might seem desirable. Ellen and Katie are very fond of Emily; so indeed, are all the children, and her gentle influence is most beneficial to them. Poor Mr. Dearbon! He is one of those silent and re- served men, for whom there is no relief in unburthening the heart. The love and watchfulness of his children are a comfort and a joy to him. He is, outwardly, calm and cheerful, but the vacant place no one can supply. Willie is growing up noble and beautiful. Rosalie is the same amiable, kind-hearted, and affec- tionate creature as ever. She says it will not do for her to stand in the way of her pretty young cousins, who are attracting a good deal of attention in society. Therefore, she is determined to be very magnanimous and give up the field to them,'if a certain poor young man, who is just beginning the practice of law, learns how to make a good pleader. Besides, she says, it would be a shame to make her aunt the trouble of moving, when she is so nicely fixed, and Mr. Rochester has got so into the habit of com- ing there to pass his evenings. She thinks if she were to be established in another home, there would be an addi- tional motive, in the loneliness of the widow, to hasten on a certain event to which matters have long been tending. We all agree with her, that nothing is wanting to com- plete the reform of our reformer, than that he should be a married man.
