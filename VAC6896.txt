                JOHN NORTON'S CONFLICT.   CHAPTER I. A lovely capricious spring day, with glimp- ses of sunshine and blue sky flung in between clouds and soft showers So the morning had been, but the day whose promise had been so sweet darkened long before night, and grew chill with a sharp east wind. The heavy sky seemed to gather close about you and the mist that swept in from the sea was blinding and chill. New York was sullen and gloomy everywhere. The long streets up town seemed all the drearier for the sun- shine of the morning, and even away down town, the squalor and misery of street and alley were darker and heavier -for the touch of light that had come and gone. A group of women stood at the open door of a gin shop. They were a miserable, half- clad set, with whiskey-bloated faces and heavy, hopeless eyes. "Luce," called out one of them as a tall mulatto passed along. "Be ye goin to the fight to-morrow?" "'Dun no," she answered. "My ole man's got the rehumatiz, an he's awful cross. Oh Lor, it's goin to be a dreffal night," she ad- ded as a gust of wind swept up the street, and the great drops began to fall. "Wat's goin on over thar?" said another of the group, pointing to a crowd of men on the opposite side of the street. '"A fight, I spose," replied Lucy. "Tim Larkin's bin sayin ugly things about Meg Burns, and Bill Jarvis he up an knocked him down, an seein Meg warnt here to help him, he got the worst on it. Tim guv it to him   right smart, an he disservs it for trottin round arter Meg as he does." '"Wat's become of Meg? Has she gon off?" "Dun no," replied Lucy, "an wat's more I dont care. She an that boy of hern feel too grand for common folk, though I guess if wat I heard bein true, she'll come down summat!" ;"Wat is it." "He's bin took up for murder," said Lucy lowering her voice and setting down her bas- ket. "Ye see thar war a gemman killed last week, him wat got Donohue's wife, an they had a quarrel, an Donohue an Meg's boy stabbed him." "That little lame feller!" exclaimed one; '1 didnt know he'd spirit enough to kill a flea.' "He's cute I tell ye," said Lucy, "ye allers find them quiet ones cute." "Wont Meg swar like the devil wen she hears it!" exclaimed a little black-eyed wo- man. "I wouldn't like to tell her, she'd tar my eyes out." "I aint afeer'd on her; jus leif tell her as not," replied Lucy, and taking up her bas- ket she went on. "Look! there comes Meg herself;" and at this moment a tall, slight woman, wrapped in a heavy gray shawl came slowly up the street. "Hello! Meg whar ye bin, and wat yer bin doin wid yerself?" called out one of the group. "None of your business," said a quick Iroice, and she would have passed them, but one seized her by the arm. "Goin to Miss Stebbins' ball to-night?"     "Let go of me or you'll get more than you like," said Meg, jerking her arm away. "Ye nedn't be so crank, had a fortune left lately that you got independent of yer friends?" A quick, fierce oath and an angry flash of the eyes was the only answer. "Yer cant open yer mouth, but she swears at ye," said one of the women, as they turn- ed down an alley and disappeared. Meg stepped out of the way of the crowd that passed to and from the gin-shop and leaned wearily against the window. She took off her bonnet and pushed back the heavy black hair from her forehead, as though the wind and rain might cool its burning heat. It was a proud, defiant face that was turned up to the sky; a face that feared neither God nor man You saw this in the full flashing eye, and the look of scorn that curled the delicate lip and nostril. There was a g;6at scar across the left tem- ple, and a cut just below the ear, which was scarcely healed, but there were marks on that handsome, reckless face, deeper and darker than these, marks of the deadly con- flict that she waged unceasingly aagaist all that was womanly and pure. It was evi- dent she was waiting for some one. for she watched the faces niarrowly, as they were brought out by the clear light from the win- dow. At last a man came along who stop- ped short as he saw her and, with an excla- mation'of surprise, came up close beside her. "Why Meg when did ve come back? Thty tole me you was gone for good." "Bill have you seen Roby; has hel been here at all to-day," she asked 'eagerly, without heeding his remark. "No," said Bill. 'l1 haint seen him, he haint bin about here. Can't you find him?" "'No," replied Meg with a deep sigh, "if I only knew where he was; he's been gone a week-something's happened to him or he'd been back." "I wish you'd let me go arter him," said Bill- '"You, you fool: you don't know where you are yourself more than half' the time. What have you been fighting about?" sho asked suddenly. "Why, man, I'd hardly know you," and she drew him to the window. He was sadly battered and bruised, his face swollen almost out of shape, and his clothes torn and covered with mud. 'fit is'nt veiy bad. I've had wus knock- ups than this," said Bill, in' an apologetic tone. 'You was gone Meg, so you see they felkon me. an I aint good for a fight." Bill Jarvis spoke the truth when he said this. He was a weak. irresolute fellow, whom men knocked and cuffed around, nick- naming him Baby Bill and Sissy Luke, and daring him to fight by taunts and insults of all kinds whenever he came in their way. He was always worsted in these street fights pounded almost to a jelly, and then left to -the tender compassion of a police officer.   Of late Meg had interfered and taken him under her protection and woe to the man who dared molest him when she was by. She could fight like a tiger when her anger was roused- and there were very few of Bill's tor- mentors that cared for a second encounter. And the gratitude of this poor, weak man showed itself in a devotion, which would have shamed the love of many a one higher- born and higher bred. He brought her all his scanty t anings, and often went hungry and cold, that she and her boy might be fbd and warmed. "Well, Bill," she said at last, "what was the row about?" "Tim Larkins was a talking about you, and I knocked him down fur it," repliedBill with a sort of lambish fierceness. 'What did he say about me?" asked Meg sharply. "He said you was the wos woman he ever knowed, and if there was a hell and a devil you'd git wat you disserved." "Humph! I aint afraid," she replied scorn- fully, "There's hell and devil enough any- where here every day, without there being any more by and by." :'Then you don't believe wat they say lapl:ens to a 'man arter they die'." asked Bill. "No: when we die we go to sleep, and that's the end of us." "An' we never wake tip?" "No," said Meg. "Well," replied Bill after a long pause. "'we oughter have sommat good, after the hard times we've had here. an I guess sleep- in wat dont wake up is good as anythin," and he took Meg's creed contentedly. "Yer. comin home aint ye?" asked Bill as he saw her turn away. "No; I must find Roby, Bill; I shall die if hbe don't come back. Ile's all I've got," and without more words she turned down a narrow street and was soon lost to sight in the gathering .iloom. Up and down through by ways and alleys Meg strode along heed- less of the storm. She had but one thought, and that was her missing boy, for sinning and outcast though she was to human 'eyes, angels saw in this mother's love much that might redeem and sanctity even such as she. It was a long way yet before Meg could reach the place of her destination, and the storm had risen to a fury, the rain fell in tor- rents, and the wind swept fiercely up the street. Meg looked around for a shelter. The splendid stores onlBroadway-were scarce ly the place where such as she might enter, and for a moment :she stood irresolute, but the storm was too violent it drove her across the street and she gladly took refuge under the balcony which protected Goupil's grand picture saloon; and Lere, partially hidden 'y the door, she had time to look. about her. The great windows that stretched from the flagging to the second story were lined with   the richest and rarest engravings that mo- dern art could supply. There were pictures from Millais' pencil, gems from Turner and Paul de La Roche. Exquisite faces from Raphael andAry Scheffer looked with loving glances in their deeli, wonderful eyes on the crowds that gathered daily around them. These were oftenest the ones whose only pic- ture gallery was carried in their hearts, and who camne here worn with study or care, to be refreshed or strengthened. The most constant of these. during the pleasant months, was a pale, delicate looking boy, whose longing eyes and bright intelligent face had often attracted the attention of the passers. Though past sixteen he was small for his years, and his whole appearance bespoke the poverty of his surroundings. Roby Burns, though the child of an outcast mvother, was -born with an artist's love of beauty, and a hunger that made his daily life barren and wretched. It was here in the presence of these lovely, saintly fcces that he firgothis misery, and came by slow degrees into an unconscious refinement of thought and feel- ing, that made hinm very different from the boys among whom he lived. He had been taught to read, and had received a little in- struction in drawing from a gentleman who had been attracted by his constant attend- ance, at this window. He took him to his office, and supplied him with pencils and pa- per. The boy showed such rare talent that his friend was about to place him under the care of an artist, when Roby disappeared, and though his friend made repeated search- es for him he was obliged to give him up, little dreaming that during the long winter months that followed, the poor boy was tos- sing wearily on a Hospital cot. When Roby was well enough he returned to his old stand and watched eagerly through the crowds for the well-known face of his friend, but it was in vain. The gentleman had removed to another part of the city, and after weeks of sorrowful waiting Roby was obliged to give up all thoughts of seeing him again. There had been a private exhibition of La Rue's Magdalen at Goupil's this afternoon, and a few of the artist's particular friends were invited to see it before the rooms were thrown open to the public. They had all left belore the storm, with the exception of one party, and these stood near the door im- patiently awaiting their carriage. Two of them attracted Meg's notice particularly, a gentleman and lady who stood so near her she might easily have touched them. Neith er had spoken for several moments, and both appeared to watch the storm intently, while the lady restlesssly tapped the floor with her dainty parasol. The gentleman was tall, with a finely developed figure, a clear complexion, chestnut hair, and dark grey eyes, in whose changing depths there was a look of tenderness and beauty that was rare in a mdn.   Honest, true eyes were these of John Nor- ton's, that neither child nor woman might fear. The rest of the face was firm and strongly marked, the nose and mouth denot- ing a. force of will, and strength of character that would hesitate at no obstacle and in his whole manner there was an expression of conscious power of strength which if tested would not fail. There are some men who win a place in your love, whether you will it or not. John Norton was one of these, and it was a cow- ardly soul that could not give him the frank hand of fellowship. The lady's face was more of a study, and it was evident that Mr. Norton thought it quite a puzzling one,from the earnest way in which he watched it. They were old friends, and scarcely remem- bered the time when they were strangers, and now this afternoon they had met again after a separation of three years. It seemed but a few days to him since he bade goodbye to that happy-hearted girl just from school, who was all eagerness and delight at the thought of the wonderful world she was about to enter. Her uncle's family, of which she had been a member for several years, were theni just sailing for Europe. Most of their time abroad had been spent in Paris and Berlin, where Mr. Ruthven's wealth and po- sition had been a passport to the best soci- ety. *Gertrude Morrison had seen all the old world could offer of art or fashion or cul- ture, and these had left their stamp :upon her dress, her face and her manners. Mnr Norton saw this at a glance, but he could scarcely understand the metamorphosis of that frank, girlish face that flung her good- bye so merrily back to him from the steam- er, into the proud, elegant woman who e thoroughbred air of worldly indifference was utterly out of keeping with what he used jo know of her. The face was as lovely as evei; the black hair rippled as of old on the fore- head, and the beautiful eyes had lost none of their depth or softness. The same witch- ery lay in the dimples about the mouth and came and went in the rare smiles that flash- ed across the face. Perhaps she would have seemed unchanged to any but John Norton, but to find this lovely dwelling locked, the key hidden, and he himself on the outside with the rest of the world, was certainly a new experience. Had Miss Morrison and Mr. Norton never met before, they would have been friends immediately. -Strangers have no troublesome background of memory to haunt them, and if congenial, glide into each other's present thinkings withoutdoubt -or surprise, but our heart friends. grow dreamlike, idealized, as it were, by long separation, and when we meet we are disap- pointed to find the face in the actual -world so unlike that of our inner life. This was the trouble here, and the meet- ing looked forward to with such pleasure by both was painful and constrained; and after a few moments of careless conversation both     lapsed into a silence that seemed impossible to break. Miss Morrison's fwocousins,Anne and Mark Ruthven, with the artist, complet- ed the party. Mark Ruthven was an easy, graceful fellow, not far from twenty-four, with handsome features, black, curling hair and moustaches, and a certain undefinable air of elegance and reserve which made him very attractive to ladies and served as a quietus to all whose curiosity or in- terest impelled them to look beneath the sur- face. He was leaning carelessly against the ta- ble, and just now he turned so that the gas fell full upon his face. There was a pale, haggard look, and a certain restless expres- sion about the eyes and mouth quite out of keeping with the perfect self-possession of his manners. Eyes less keen than John Nor- ton's would never have noticed these things, but he found himself days after, oddly curi- ous about this manner. for he used to say be- fore Mark joined his uncle in Europe, that it would have to be a rare combination of  circumstances which could throw him offhis   e guard, or disturb that cool, easy self-assur- e ance which made him at the same time the t- most impudent and most taking he ever knew. Mark was agreat favorite with his uncle's family, and when it suited his con- r venience made it his home with them, and e by those delicate attentions which he knew I so well how to render was quite invaluable to Anne and her invalid brother, Arthur. He and Gertrude had never agreed very well, though they seldom came in collision. He had a fancy that she saw deeper than most people whether she did or not. Anne Ruthven was more attractive in face and manners than her cousin Gertrude, with a brilliancy about her that always won the at- tention of strangers, but it was only surface glitter. A cold heart and a selfish nature had not been improved by three years of training in the school of French morals and French manners. She had been mistress of her father's elegant home for several years, and her easy assurance and decided ways made her seem much older than Gertrude.   CHAPTER II. So far Meg had been unnoticed by the par- ty, but her curiosity got the better of her judgment, and before she was aware she stood in full view, so close to Gertrude that her rich silk rustled against the grey shawl. Another time Miss Morrison would have been annoyed; but she was troubled and restless herself to-night. and the longing look in the woman's eyes touched her with pity. Miss Ruthven's face on the contrary was full of scorn. "Why does not Mr. Norton send that crea- ture away, what business has she here?"was her haughty question. "Handsome, isn't she?" said Mark, and turning to the artist who stoo0 beside him, added, "La Rue, you needn't to Italy for Magdalens, there's one that Iwould rival  yours, It would only need a few saintly f touches. Convert her, I believe that's the c orthodox phrase; isn't it, Norton? you ought to know. Norton will take the job for you, i La Rue. it is in his line. Anne," he con-  tinued softly, "you can understand now e why Mr. Norton has joined the saints, and ignores us worldlings; the charm of convert- t   ing such lovely sinners and listening to their confessions is consolation enough for the loss - of other society." r John made no reply, but a flash from Ger- trude's eves plt an end to Mark's comments. She turned to Meg and asked her what she would like. "Nothing that you can give me, lady," and then followed a simple recital of Roby's disappearance and her search. "And mav be sir, you remember him," she said turning to Mr. Norton. "You were very kind to him before he was sick, and gave him some lessons at your office. He used to stand here to see the pictures." Roby Burns! Are you Roby's mother?" said John eagerly. I took a great fancy to him, why didn't he come to my office again. 1 did my best to find him." "'Oh, sir! he was- so sick; he was in the hospital all winter and he took such com- fort out of the little books and pictures you gave him." John would have asked more, but a pol- iceman made his appearance and seizing Meg's arm, bade her leave. Mr. Norton ask ed who she was. "Nothing more than she ought to be,"was the short reply. Y'he is the hardest custo-   mer we have to deal with, worse than any two men. "We know each other though," he said with a low chuckle, "and there aint much love lost when we're together." '"She is in great trouble to-night," said John, "her boy is missing," "Yes. He's taken up as an accomplice in the Morley murder. He'll hang for it, and I wish to goodness they would include the mother." With these words he went on his way. The Ruthven carriage now drove up and John who was to dine with the family took his seat beside Gertrude. It was only a short drive to reach their elegant home in Madison square and Arthur was ready with such a warm greeting, and even Mr. Ruthven was so cordial, that John could hardly realize that three years had elapsed since he had been one of their circle, for the families had always been on the most intimate terms of friendship. Mr. Ruthven, sen., was a haughty aristocrat, whose family pride and conscious family po- sition were very marked. He was a man of taste and considerable culture, proud of his daughter and niece, and anxiocs to make brilliant settlements for them, but he knew nothing of the world beyond his own circle, the rest were outcast and heathen. Dinner was announced almost immediately after their arrival home, and John found himself between Anna and Arthur, opposite to Ger- trude. The conversation around the table very soon became animated. Indeed it was diffi- cult where Anna was for it to be otherwise. She talked well herself, and had the rare grace of making others talk well too. As usual the conversation, glided on without any apparent effort, or much thought, the gay spirits of the company giving a life to it which was very entertaining. It glanced here and there on gossip, fashion, art and po itics, but it never rested long enough to touch deeply anywhere. This was Anna's tact, she always kept the stroke oar, and when the tide ran too strong in any direction, she gave the con- versation an adroit turn and set it afloat on another sparkling wave. A novice might have thought that so much sail without rud-  der or ballast would have stranded before long, but John entered into it with as much spirit as any one, and the pleasure of having ] his friends at home again gave an unusual charm to his frank, humorous conversation. 1 As the table was cleared for dessert, a ser- vant handedthe evening paper to Mr. Ruth- ren. He passed it to John, saying: "Read i the news for us."           E There was little f general interest and I the telegraph items and stock market were e soon finished.             N "Please open the paper," said Anna, "and s see if there is anything more about the c Morley murder. We feel especially inter- ested; we knew Morley abroad tho' never in- timately, but as he was one of Mark's cron-   ies we saw a good deal of him at one time. He was a charming man; his manners, his dress, his conversation were elegant in the extreme. He was always at leisure, and en- tered for the time, with a perfect abandon, into whatever wasyour whim. I have heard sad stories about him since his death and there were occasional flings at him, while we were abroad, but that was none of our concern. He suited us for the time, and we did not trouble ourselves with looking be- neath. Mr. Morley was better than the gen- eral run and is simply unfortunate now, in being brought rather too prominently before the public. The world is the same all the way through. It is tact, not principle that makes men differ;don't you think so Mr Nor- ton?" "iNo, indeed Miss Anna, I don't," he re- plied, in his honest, sincere way. "As sure as there is a God above, I believe that there is as much truth, honor and justice, in the world, as rascality; and next to my faith in Him, comes my faith in my fellow men." "It is a beautiful theory," replied Anna, and you are one of the few men whose life would make me believe it true. Gertrude made no comment, though she gave him one of her old glances of apprecia- tion and approval. Anna continued, -"you and Gerda seem to take opposite extremes. She believes the world is going to destruction-as fast as it can, and only longs for a second deluge to complete the work," "Not quite so bad as that," replied Ger- trude, "though my experience has been ra- ther unfortunate, I am sorry to say." "Unluckily," said Mark, "Gerda came in- to this new world with her eyes wide open, she should at least have had nine days of grace." Gertrude laughed. "That's a fact, Mark; ignorance certainly is bliss here." "It would have been in your case," he re- plied, "you take things in such an earnest way. If you could only be cool as Anna and I are. It don't pay to make geological sur- veys into Society, and I think the old Irish- man's motto would apply here. 'If you can't be aisy, be as aisy as you can.'" Gertrude shook her head but did not re- ply, while Anna turned to John, saying: "Now what has the Herald to say about the Morley affair." John glanced'over the paper. "It is too long to read, but the substance is this: Two persons have been arrested; one a man by the name of Donohue, the other a boy, called Burns. There is no reason giv- en for his connexion with it, except that ha was a friend of Donohue's, but uonohue had some excuse for his proceedings, if this ac- count be true." "What was it!" asked Mark. John replied: "He had a beautiful wife, a young girl,     and Morley persuaded her toleave him. He vowed vengeance, and has taken it, so it seems. Poor fellow, he loved her desper- ately. "I knew about that at the time," said Mark. "I have seen her; she is handsome as a picture and looks the lady every inch of her. Donohue was a fool though to risk his neck for her." "I justify any man for taking t!'c matter into his own hands with such a provocation" said Gertrude spiritedly; "that is one of the crimes the law don't touch. Mark, what would you have done, if she had been your wife?" "Let her go,' said he coolly. "If the man she preferred was as much my superior as Morley was Donohues I would have admir- ed her good taste. Her husband had noth- ing but poverty to offer her, and Morley could gratify every whim; a girl has plenty of these." "If I thought you were in earnest. Mark, I should be thoroughly ashamed of you. You may put whatever elegant cover on Mor- ley you choose, but the plain English of it all will read villainy of the first degree," and Gertrude's face grew so spirited and bright, that she looked more like her old self than John had yet seen her., "I pity Donohue from the bottom of my heart," she continued. "Save your pity," said Anne, "'for a more worthy object. The miserable creature is not worth it. Your second deluge would be well sent, if it could take off this lower grade of society. We sh(uld quite enjoy a world that had neither cut-throats nor beggars in it. As it is, they are constantly thrusting themselves upon us. You saw this woman to-night. " "Yes," said John, "she was the mother of this boy Burns. I should never have thought of his committing murder. He was a talent- ed little fellow, and so grateful for all the interest I took in him. I must find him to- morrow." And here the conversation which had sud- denly grown so earnest, whirled back into its old channel and John entered into a mer- ry discussion with Anne about the last novel. Dinner was soon completed and as they rose from the table Arthur said: "This is the evening of Anne's reception. We will take possession of the side parlor, and have a quiet chat while the ladies are dressing." This was alittle room opening from the main parlors by sliding doors, which were drawn aside to-night, and the entrance drap- ed with lace curtains. John and Arthur seated themselves behind these in a cozy corner, and,entered immediately into a frank animated talk, in regard to all that had transpired since their parting. They had been the dearest of friends for many years, and the renewal of their old college attach- ment was very pleasant to both. They were   so much engrossed in conversation that they were scarcely aware of the arrival of the guests till John looked up and found the par- lors nearly filled, in spite of the storm, with a gay and brilliant company. Gertrude flit- ted here and there, apparently entering in- to the enjoyment of the evening with all her spirits, but John knew from the half-amused half-scornful way in which she listened to the crowd of young exquisites that fluttered around her, she had very little in common with her admirers. The lady's polite French phrases were am- biguous, to be construed any way, and John was quite disposed to laugh at the satisfied manner in which the quiet sarcasms were appropriated. Every now and then he caught her eye, and the longing glances she cast toward the ottoman at Arthur's side, with the comical looks of resignation she gave him, were very amusing. At length there was a fresh arrival of guests, and, taking advantage of the stir, Gertrude took possession of the coveted seat and with a mischievous glance toward John dropped the lace curtains, so that she was entirely hidden from the other room. 'Isn't this pleasant"she - .d as she watch- ed the changing throng in L;.u parlors. "Do you know I am a firm believer in Mahomed- anism? It is an essential part of their creed that a woman should see and not be seen, and distance certainly lends enchantment to the view." After a few moments of careless chatting Arthur rose to go. "I suppose I shouldn't have staid here at all this evening, but the temptation was too great. If I am sick to-morrow; John, I shall send for you to nurse me. Anyway I shall keep you to-night. When you are tired of these people come to me," and bidding them good-night he disappeared at a side door. As John took possession of Arthur's va- cant seat close to'Gertrude, she looked up with an arch glance and said: "Are you tired of these people?" "It depends entirely upon how agreeable these people prove to be," he replied, "and what amends they make for past delinquen-' cies. If my memory serves me right, all that you have said since we met might eas- ily be written on half a sheet of note paper. Perhaps," he continued in a bantering tone, "you would prefer French to English. Mine is a little rusty to be sure, but with the help of a dictionary we might get along nicely." "'Oh, Mr. Norton, don't talk French to me!"Gertrude exclaimed, as he commenc- ed a very polite phrase, with an ease that showed that he was quite familiar with the language, "I like it well enough for com- pany, when one must say so much and mean so little, but to talk with you in French would make me think I was really under a spell, and had lost myself in some of our wanderings.- Indeed I am not sure more than half the time that the Gerda who went   abroad, has returned, and if you treat me as the rest of the world does I shall feel cer- tain that I've changed souls with samebo- dy."  "Look and let me see," said John mischiev- ously. The face was raised with such a childlike trusting look. It had grows very beautilul in three years, deepening and rounding, and now it seemed to him that he had never seen any one half so lovely. It flushed a lit- tle beneath his earnest look of admiration, and he said softly: "It is the same face with the same look in the eyes. I did think you were changed when we first met, but I am mistaken. This is my old friend Gerda, and if she cares to look, she will find the place that she holds in my heart as warm as ever. I have missed you very much," he added, "and I do not think any one can be hapj'ier at your return than I am." *I believe you, John," and there were no more doubts in either mind. Itseems so natural here," ,he continued that I can scarcely believe it is three years since we parted." "It seems twice three years to me," she replied. And there came such a weary, troubled look into her face. John watched her a mo- ment and then said:   "Evidently you and the world are not on the best of terms. Gerda. What is the matter; you haven't used it all up in three years have you?" "I don't know," she said sadly, "I am very tired ofall this whirl and gayety and would like to stop for a while, but I don't see any prospect of that. We have at least a dozen invitations ahead, and com- pany all the time at home.  We don't take life in homeopathic doses in this house." ' "No, I don't think you do," said John laughing. "I fancied we  should have some change when we came home, but this is Paris over again, only a little diluted. I suppose every one  feels as I do after a while, only Mark says I don't take thingscool enough, that's the trouble." The conversation glided on very pleasant- ly for a while, when John said: "Gerda, do you'lemember our pleasant talks in the library? let us go in there. The room looked very inviting as I passed it af- ter dinner." a Thank you," said she rising and taking his proffered arm. "We can talk there with- I out fear of interruption, and I have so many things to ask you."   CHAPTER III. This library was the favorite family room opening on the opposite side of the hall from the parlors, and during the first winter of Arthur's sickness, had been the daily gath- ering place of his friends. John and Ger- trude were oftenest with him, and the pleas- antest hours of their friendship had been passed'here. Itopened on one side into a little garden. and on the other into a splen- did conservatory which was now filled with lovely flowers in full bloom There was a fountain in the centre, which threw its jets of water into a mossy covered basin where gold and silver fish sparkled in the cool depths. Beautiful statuary gleamed here and there, amid tLe trailing vines, and deli- cate blossoms. Birds hung in golden cages, and orange and jessamine sowers filled the air with their perfume. At the farther end there were two large mirrors which gave the rooft the appearance of an enchanted palace,   The library itself was scarcely less attract- ive. The ruby colored carpet and furniture the rich paneling of oak and walnut, the carved bookcases filled with their rare treas- ures of science and literature, the statuary which stood in the crimson niches, were all tinted and brightened by the light of a clear coal fire. The gas had been turned down, but the blazing chandelier in the conservat- ory made the room light enough while the softened shadows gave a charm to the fire which it would have lost in a more brilliant room. "We had our last talk here the night be- fore you sailed; do you remember it Gerda," asked John. "'Yes;" replied Gertrude, "and I remem- ber too the little girl who sat on this stool and played with the apple-blossoms, while you gave her such brotherly advice."  She looked up with a roguish glance and i then added soberly, as she caught sight of herself in a long mirror:     "I wish my fairy god-mother would trans- form me, just for to-night; I would like to be a little girl again." John was silent. for the picture was so fresh. It was a sweet May evening, not quite three years before when he and Ger- trude sat together just at sunset. he in the arm chair before him, and :hce on a stool at his feet. She was dressed in a delicate mus- lin, and the cluster of apple blossoms he had brought her that afternDon from the country were trimmed among 'he rippling curls of her hair and lay in her lap. She had tossed the pink leaves about till his hair and dress were quite covered, trying meanwhile to so- ber her happy face into becoming gravity,as she listened to his earnest words of parting. Her fresh beauty, the simple child-like look and the eager interest with which she anti- cipated her visit to Europe, all came back. Beside him stood a beautiful woman, but she looked like a gay tropical bird in con- trast with the figure in the picture, the flash- ing jewels on her hair and neck, and the ru- by tint of her rich silk, made the color in that room seem pale, while the face told its own story of anticipations which had never been realized, of pleasures which had grown utterly tasteless. They seated themselves before the fire. "Now, Gerda," said John, "you must sup- ply the missing links between that evening and this. You might as well have been in the wilds of Africa, as far as I am concern- ed. Arthur's letters at best were very irreg- ular and the accounts I have had of your whereabouts from any other source were vague and uncertain." 'Where shall I begin?" she asked. "Where you left off; the story ended with 'Good-bye John don't forget me.'" Gertrude commenced in a laughind way, and gave him a rapidtand graphic sketch of their'lite abroad. She had a great fund of humor and a keen eye for anything that was absurd and comical, and the piquant dashy touches she flung into her picture of Europ- ean life were very amusing, but in all there was a bitterness, that pained her friend and made him feel that to her life had lost its freshness, and society stood before her in all it deformily and corruption. After a mo- ment's sil nee he said: "These are young eyes to see so far and so sadly too. I don't quite understand it Gertrude." '"I believe I have lost faith utterly in everything that is good and pure. I see people make such miserable failures of life that I have lost all heart and concluded to drift with the current," she continued. "It is lovely to hear you or Arthur talk of a life that is tilled with the fulness of Christ, and while I am listening I believe the dream may be real, but it is another thing to take this same life, and test it in the world. I could be good in a quiet home, where all my surroundings were religious, as much of a   saint as any body. I don't think that is any proof of piety." "Gertrude." said John so earnestly that she started. "'Religion is either everything or nothing, and true principle will stand any test. The faith that sanctifies the quiet life, is the same faith that glorifies that life amid the most fearful temptations. Christ never leaves His children, nor places them where they cannot honor Him by proving the pow- er of His grace, if they only will. Why, Gerda, I should faint and utterly fall, if I did not believe this." "And," replied Gertrude decidedly, "you don't know much about temptation. The tide has always been with you as far as I can see; the very air you breathe is religious; the most of your friends you 'used to say, were earnest christians and certainly all your surroundings are helpers in the right way. You ought to be good. you have no excuse for being anything else. But only wait till you are breasting the current with everything against you, and struggling alone for life in the waves, and tht n see what the result will be. When you have been testedJohn, and have not failed I will believe." '"Then may God help me Gerda, he re- plied solemnly, "if your hopes of salvation depend upon my success or failure, for they are dearer to me than my own" "And Gertrude's face grew very grave and both were silent. he had been standing before the fire for the past few moments, watching her as they t dked, and she now suddenly looked up with a beseeching glance and said: "Oh John! please do not think I have been so very wicked or did not care toryour kind words of parting. I did try for a long time to be good, but what was the use. One can't do it. Anna's scorn and uncle's sar- casmn were too much, so I became like the rest. We never went to church, we scarcely knew when the sabbath came, and the only wonder is, that 1 didn't make shipwreck of everythitg, and go utterly astray. I did think once that I would carry my mother's faith and principles into the world, but 1 don't see how it is to be done. The truth is, I was in a state of bewilderment all the time. The right and the wrong seemed to be so tangled up. If some one could only have helped me." "Why didn't you ask Arthur?" "I did, but he couldn't do me any good. We look at things through such diffebrent eyes. He took very little pleasure in what interested us most, and seldom went to pla- ces of amusement with us. People can't judge much of whtt they don't know any- thing about from experience. If I only could have talked with you. You know what I want by a sort of instinct, and don't bother me with questions." "Why didn't you write to me, Gerda? I should have been so glad to have heard   from you, and would have given you all the help I was able to." "You never asked me to. By the by John, why didn't you? I hadn't thought of it before." "Gerda, do you really want me to tell you? he exclaimed, suddenly seating himself upon a stool by her side, and leaning his arm up- on her chair "'It was simply because I loved you so well," he continued in a voice that trembled with emotion. "You were a child when you went away. Could I have been sure then of your love. I held myself too dear, to take advantage of your ignorance of the world, and the trust your uncle had al- ways placed in me, so I was silent. I re- solved if you came back with a free heart and the old friendship for me, I would try what my devotion could do in winning you. I did not mean to tell you this to-night, but perhaps it is just as well. I must have known before long how we stood toward each other. You have always been dearest and best, lit- tle one; I have not much to offer, but such as I have give I unto thee." "Take me John," was the soft answer, "I am not worthy of your love, I have been a very naughty girl, but you will help me to be good, wont you!" and the sweet face nest- led itself close upon his shoulder. "I don't think you need much training," he answered patting the soft cheek. "Little one," he added after a pause, "do you think you will be contented with my quiet home and quiet ways. I have but little as yet, but if God prospers me, as 1 believe he will, some day I can give you a home like this." "Don't fear John," was the quick reply, "1 never want such a home as this, never never. I don't take kindly to this sort of life and it always comes with great houses. A quiet nest anywhere with you is all I care. Some place where I can learn to be good and forget this wild troubled life," and the old look of by gone days came back into the beautiful eyes. Perhaps there is no time in a girl's life when all the possibilities of her deepest nature become so suddenly consci- ous as under the first touch of a deep manly love. Transfigured as it were, with the worldliness and the dross of her nature swept away, she stands the embodiment of all that is noblest and best in woman. It may not last long-it seldom does-for the old life is strong, but if the vision vanish forever, and the rest of her life be poor and bitter, let no woman speak bitterly or scorn- fully of such dreams. Rather let her thank God that once she caught a glimpse of what future life may reveal, a life whose highest bliss will be the consciousness that self is lost in the measureless depths of Infinite Love. All this came to Gertrude in the talk that followed. She seemed lifted into a higher atmosphere, where the old life lay misty and shadowlike beneath her, and the new life grew soft and luminous with the touches of the early dawn. She had looked up   to John from her earliest girlhood as a stand- ard for all that was manly and noble. HMi opinions and his ways of thinking had grown into her heart, and no amount of worldly training could entirely eradicate, these and at no time in the giddiest whirl of that Paris life, had she been utterly unmindful of what he might expect of her when they met. This was her safeguard; the unseen chain that had held her back from becoming utter- ly selfish and worldly. John Norton loved in the same honest fearless way that he liv- ed. He was not quick to give his faith or trust to any one, but when once given it needed a wonderful amount of evidence to pursuade him that he was deceived or dis- appointed, His love for Gertrude had grown into the very depths of his nature, but his self control had been so strong and his thoughts of her so much a matter of prin- cipie, that he scarcely knew till to-night, when she nestled beside him, a happy, pet- ted child, the force and power of his feeling. At length Gertrude said: "We must go back to the parlors. Anna will never forgive me for monopolizing you." As they left the library one of Gertrude's Paris acquaintances claimed her for a dance and John joined a party of his friends at the end of the hall. He was always a favor- ite, though his earnest piety made him so different from most of the guests he met to- night, yet his manly, frank way, and his quick sympathy with all whom he met' won the respect and, interest of even the worst of his acquaintances. Reckless as they might be they could not but admire such thorough out spoken consistency as Mr. Norton's. Mark and Gertrude were standing with John in the deep recess of a bay window as the last carriage drove away from Mr. Ruthren's. They had opened the shutters and were watching the storm which still swept fierce- ly up the street, and the wild night and dreary outlook seemed all the more wild and dreary from the solitary figure of a man, who was slowly making his way in the face of the storm. He crossed the street, and passing before the house, paused as if attract ed by the brilliancy of the window. He had a restless hurried manner quite in keep- ing with the night and the air of one who had something heavier than wind or storms to battle with. As he reached the corner he turned, retraced his steps, and stopping abruptly before the window, gave a' keen, quick glanpe, as if he recognized some one. It was but a moment that John caught a glimpse of his face, but he did not soon for- get its dark sinister look, nor the peculiar expression that flashed across it. What did it mean and who was it for? He looked at the two beside him. Mark grew suddenly pale as the man's face came out in the clear light, and Gertrude gave a quick start. "Why Mark! it is Jolibert, where'in the world has he come from? I have such a haunting dread of that man, He crosses     our track in such odd curious ways, and we have met him so many times abroad that I am almost superstitious enough to believe that he is somehow linked with my fate, and by and by will bring me to trouble." Mark was looking steadily out of the win- dow in his old careless way, but he turned to Gertrude and said quietly: What a silly chill you are. to allow a foolish prejudice against that fellow to influ- ence you in such an absurd way. Hle is ug- ly enoulh I own to be the old Nick himself. but he isn't to blame for his face. From all I have seen' he seem to be a quiet well-be- haved fellow, who minds his own business, and would be the last one to trouble you if he coulld." "Who is he?" asked John. "A Frenchman," Mark replied whom he   had often noticed in Paris and remembered from his singular face. He was travelling agent for some firm there he believed, but could not tellwhat he did. He never had any conversation with him but once, and then he appeared more intelligent than that class of men usually were. John glanced at the window again but the man had gone. "Please close the shutters Mark, and come away. Fither the storm or that man's face has made me dreadfully blue," said Ger- trude. And it seemed to John as if the shadow that crossed her vision, suddenly swept in and darkened his sunshine. Weeks after, when the vague dread of that night had become a heavy heart-breaking reality he understood it all.   CHAPTER IV. It was long past midnight when 1Meg left Donohue's to return home. So far her search for Roby had been fruitless. Dono- hue himself had disappeared, and all trace of him was lost. After repeated enquiries she turned her weary, dispirited footsteps home- ,ward. She might find her boy there. It was the last hope, but it was so vague, that the chill and darkness of night seemed only the reflex of the gloom within. The rain was over but the wind still blew wild and high. and the ragged broken clouds swept on before it like the vanguard of a routed, panic-stricken army. Once in a while the pale moon looked through the long rifts and threw a fitful uncertain light over the whole scene. Meg wasjust in that mood of mind to be painfully susceptible to outward influ- ences. A sudden calamity that opens its depth and hopelessness to us in an instant, bewilders and stuns our senses, and the whirl of life that goes on as we lay broken and helpless scarcely stirs a thought. But the oncoming of a great dread starts every ficulty into life. We read the confirmation of our wildest fears in the passing shadows and start, and shudder at the rustle of a leaf, or the flutter of a restless curtain. To one as undisciplined and untutored as Meg, there was a vividness to all surround- ing impressions that startled her in a pain- ful and indefinable way. The long street looked so solemn and weird like, with the   touches of grey moonlighton them and a stillness so deep that it might be felt. There was nothing astir away up town where Meg was; and it seemed at every step as if the whole world would vanish and leave her alone. As she neared home the signs of life became more visible. but these all wore the same phantom-ghastly look, as the fog that slowly crept in as the wind went down wrapping everything in its soft grey folds. Now and then a woman flitted by her with a pale, mist-like shadow, and policemen went by in groups of two's and three's. Meg heard the noise of a fight not far away, with plenty of cursing and swear- ing, and a woman's passionate, angry cries. At the dance-house just about where she lived, there was a loud call for "Watch! Watch!" and the sudden opening of windows as a crowd of men and women came out with half a dozen police officers. Meg's room was the third story, and the broken stairway groaned and creaked as she climbed slowly up. She opened the door and called "Roby," and a- man who lay asleep in the corner stirred uneasily and answered: "Roby must be dead, I can't find him." Meg shook the speaker fiercely, and asked what he knew about her boy, but he only half opened nis eyes. and made the same reply. "Sleep away you fool," Meg muttered to herself. "you don't know much more than a dead kitten when you are awake and have all your wits."   It was Bill Jarvis who had taken posses- S sion of the room. intending to keep watch li for Meg, but he was too weary and had fal- c len asleep. The fire which he had lighted a was almost burned away, a candle smoked M stupidly on the mantle. and this with the r feeble brands gave almost as fitful a light as fi the moon had done, so that one got but a vague idea of the long, irregular room Meg o called home. Some rich bits of faded car-  peting lay about, and odd pieces cffurniture I which had been handsome once; but the d windows were oroken, and the ceilings dim s with smoke and cobwebs.        f Meg shivered in the chill air, and untying I her wet bonnet and shawl, she tossed them 1 away. A glass of gin stood on the mantle,  anid the fragments of a supper which Bill had s carefully saved from his scanty meal. Meg 1 cared for nothing but the gin which she  drank with desperate eagerness and then E looked for more, but the bottle was empty. 1 Usually such a draught would quiet her nerves, but to-night it was like a touch of  fire to her restless, excited nature, and as she drew the brands together, and sat down  before the flickering blaze, it seemed as if her old self had suddenly waked up and the -soul that had been starving for years cried out with a cry that would not be denied. Where was her boy, the child that in some  vague, misty way was to lift her up, and make her better? Meg's redemption was to come through him, so she had always thought in her poor, blind way, for no soul is ever so dark and hopeless in this life, but longings for something beyond will come. These may be vague, they may be voiceless, but they are the stir and rustle of our immortal life. WasRoby dead? If so, all hope was gone and there was no use now of even wish- ing to be better. Who cared except Roby, who ever did care? and the woman's face grew desolate and bitter, as the prison walls of her life seemed to draw closer about her. What had she done that she deserved this? Wasn't her life dark enough anyway, and when had it ever been worth the living? The old memories came back fast. She was in London again a homele-s, forsaken girl, and there her artist lover had found her and taught her all she had ever known, and making her life tor a few months as bright as love and sunshine could. Could there be sin in anything that made one so happy? Meg tried in herblind way to un- derstand how it was, and yet the world had flung her off for this very thing, and washed its hands clean of her. There in New York when she stood friendless and alone with a dead lover, and a baby but a few months old, not a house or hand had opened to help her. Nobody but the Devil had ever cared where she went in that christian city of sab- baths and churches, and she was not slow in in learning this bitter lesson in the few at- tempts she made to gain an honest living.   She thought, poor child, thatshe was, would like to be good for her baby's sake. What could she do? There was butone dooropen and so Meg went down,-God only knows what a terrible thing the wreck ofa woman's soul is, and yet even he takes them in, and forgives to seventy times seven. The world sneers or smiles but passes by on the other side, and while it scourges the sinner it makes light of the sin. Sure Meg Burns was far from innocent when her lover died, but Meg the ignorant child, with a soul hungering for love, was very different from the flaunting woman who sauntered up Broadway in hersilk and velvets. To-night her old life with Barns came back so firsh and new the only thing that bound her to it seemed to be broken. Was there anything to lift her up and make her better now? Was there such a thing as woman's washing her. self, and making her soul white? Strange memories came drifting in of old, forgotten words, that she had found in a Bible years ago, when Burns first died, but they hud been lost in the whirl and passion of her after life, and Roby had told of a story he had heard, she well remembered how angr  it made her, of the wonderful and infinite Christ, the Christwho could forgive and save to the uttermost. It was the same Christ he loved so well. All at once the light flared up from the nearly extinguished candle, and lit up a picture just above the mantel. It was one of Robv's, a coarse en- graving of an old catholic picture, Mary Magdalen fainting beneath the cross and the Savior stretching out His hand to help her. Rough as it was, there was a power about it that struckMeg as she looked up. It seemed as if the face of Christ grew tender and loving toward her, and the open hand was ready to grasp hers. A moment more, and the light flashed out. Meg was in utter darkness. She had nev- 3 er noticed this picture before, though it had hung there many months. Did it mean ? anything? Could this Christ really help I her? and where was the way. Sho thougat of Roby and the strange power it had exert. ed over him. Was this the reason he was so i different frome very one about her, so gentle, I so patient, so fill of love for her. If he , would only come back to her, she would try, try to be good, and even if he did not return I it might be, if she tried in her poor way, to redeem the rest of her life, the sins of the -present time would be washed away and at i last, in some happier place, she would find I her boy again, and they two be together k forever. Her infidelity was all gone, for a there is nothing like the death of our belov- s ed ones, and our yearnings to be with them, p to bring a certain coasciousaess of life here- d after. - And here Meg fell asleep and did not n wake till the day began to dawn. The t- sound of voices started her from her heavy ,. sleep, and opening her eyes, she saw Lucy     the mulatto, who lived on the floor above, standing in the middle of the room with Bill who was wide awake, and trying to silence her. There was a mutual antipathy between these two women, and only on special occa- sions, did Lucy dare to venture into Meg's room. Indeed, Meg usually kept herself aloof from those about her, and this with Roby's air of refinement, made her many enemies, and none more bitter and tantaliz- ing than Lucy. Aristocracy whether in sa- tin or rags, is not one of the essential oils of human kindness, as Meg's past experience had shown. "Hello Meg, how do ye find yersel this mornin? Ye'll come down a peg or two, and wont goflauntin round, makin bleeve yer better an yer neighbors, when ye find out whar Roby is." The sound of Lucy's shrill voice, and her significant words, startled all Meg's half- aroused faculties. "Roby!" she exclaimed, "do you know where Roby is, tell me quick." "'Ye'd like to knoW, wouldn't you," re- plied Lucy tauntingly. "Mothers like to know when their boys-are in the Toombs tuk up for murder," "Shut up, you black devil; you know better, Rolty isn't there, and never will be," said Meg fiercely, and her eyes blazed in a why that would have frightened a timid wo- man. "Go an see for yersel," was the answer. "If ye don't believe, yell find him thar, an wat's more, he wont git out. My boy's not too good, but he don't set up for a gemman, an take to murder for a trade. Roby's got a nice white neck, it ul show off the rope well oh Lor, it ul be a purty sight to see him a swingin an a danglin at the end." Bill had watched her in a helpless sort of way, but the cruelty of these last words   , roused him, and he struck her a blow that I sent her spinning from the room. k  "Take that you black fool. Niggers haint got no feelins," said Bill, apologetically. The suddenness of the whole thing had - bewildered Meg. She looked to her com- 3panion for an explanation, but his eyes fell, ' and he stood twisting and hitching his trous- Lers, looking more like a culprit than a com- forter. "Bill! what do you know, you know some- thing about this, tell me." she said in an ex- F cited way. "Oh Meg! it is all so. Roby's in the Toombs, he an Donohste are tuk up for Mor- ley's murder. I saw the officers take em yesterday, but I couldn't tell ye." Meg sank back in her chair, and dropped her face in her hands. Bill's words were true. Roby in the Toombs, what an outlook for a mother's hope, and a mother's faith. Roby must be innocent she knew that, but who else would ever find it out. Such as she had no friends and the world was only too ready to have them go. Oh the bitterness of the thought, the disgrace was a thousand times worse than death. Bill went up to her, the stony look in her eyes and her ilence startled him. "Oh Meg, dont look so," he said piteous- ly. "It's better an havin him dead, and may be it aint so bad." "Shut up you fool, if you don't I'll thrash you." And Bill, who saw from her. eyes that this was no idle threat, crept softly from the rooma with the bewildered feeling of a man, who somehow had made a great blllnder. The clear, fresh sunshine came at length into the room, and touched the despairing, hopeless face, bitt the eyes saw nothing but the blankness of darkness everywhere.   CHAPTER Y. It was nearly noon before John found time to visit the Toombs in search of Roby. He passed in through the curious Egyptian en- trance, up the two flights of stairs that led to the third corridor, where checkered mar- ble floor and open coal fire were quite invit- ing. The sunshine that came through the barred windows lay on the pavement in bro-   ken squares of restless light. Yet it was real sunshine, so the pleased face of one of the prisoners seemed to say, and he held his fingers close to the window that the light might trickle through them. A grave, quiet looking Scotchman, the warden, sat at a small desk, writing. John asked for Burns and Donohue. Mr. Kimball arose and led the way to a cell at the farthest end of the hall. The inner door was open, and John   took a hasty glance at the inmates before he entered.               ! Roby held his testament in his hand and was sketching on the margin, in an absent way, singularly beautiful heads, with shad- owy wings. Meg sat on the cot, watching Roby; her face rested on her hand, and the look of dumb agony in the dark, mournful eyes appealed to John Norton most .power- fully. Donohue had shrank as far as possi- ble from the light, and sat in the farthest corner of the cell, perfectly listless. He idly twisted and untwisted a piece of cord, around his fingers and scarcely raised his eyes when John entered. He was a quiet sensitive man, not given to much demons- tration nor many words, and the broken, hopeless expression of his whole attitude, together with a certain pitiful look in the eyes strung every fibre of John's soul with indignation at a wrong so wanton and reck- less. Roby's quick look of pleasure faded, and he dropped his head for an instant at *his old friend's first greeting, but it was raised again with the old clear look. "I did not do it Mr. NorLin, I am not guilty. God knows I am not; I am sorry to have you find me here, after you were so kind. I did not stab Mr. Morley, though I wanted to. after he took her away." And the boy's face flushed with the pass- ing feeling. He was paler and thinner than John had seen him before, and looked as if he had suffered from exposure, but there was a quiet in the eyes, and a fearless look, that be the facts against him what they may, John was satisfied in his own mind that the boy was innocent. "Do you think they'll hang me?"Roby asked. "'Not unless you are guilty," said John. "Tney say it will go hard with us, but I don't see why. Donohue says he had as lief hang as inot, he has nothing to live for; but I, I've got mother, and somehow when I was sick last winter I thought I saw a way to something better for us both, but it is all up now," and Roby drew a long sigh, and dropped his face upon his hand. After a pause John said: "Now Roby tell me frankly and honestly all you know about this matter, and if you are really innocent, as I believe you are, I will give you what help I can, and will at least see jastice done you both, come what may." Roby gave him a brief account of his ac- quaintance with Donohue. They had known each other for about two years and spent many evenings together, Donohue being fond of projecting little inventions, which Roby sketched, as he knew nothing about drawing. Donohue's wife was very young and beautiful, and had always been kind to Roby, winning his heart by her kindness and  gracious manner, while the lovely face satisfied his artistic eyes as none other had ever done.   They   were all very happy till Mr. Morley came, since then Donobue had been good for no- thing. At first they were very angry and vowed vengence, but latterly they had said nothing about her. Donohue never spoke and he wouldn't--and hereRoby cast a quick glance toward the silent man who so far had taken no notice of Mr. Norton's presence. After all, Roby's story as to the real mat- ter of their connection and acquaintance with Morley was extremely unsatisfactory. There was something back that John could not touch, they might be innocent, there had been temptation enough to make them both guilty. The few attempts John made to learn anything more from Donobhue himself were unavailing. He didn't believe in gentlemen anyhow bothering themselves with other people's matters. He had had enough of gentlemen. If they wanted to hang him, what he said was no good. Rich men' did as they pleased with poor men, and the laws were all with them. He didn't care, the good of life was gone, and he went on twist- ing his bit of cord in the old, aimless way. Roby looked troubled, and Meg who had listened eagerly to every word, asked: "And do you think you can save him?" 'I hope so, I will try. God so help me." was Mr. Norton's answer. Meg's face fell. "If that's all the help you've got, you're badly off. He don't trouble Himself -about them as loves Him, else Roby wouldn't be here." "Oh mother!" exclaimed Roby, "don't say so, God does help us every where, and lIe comes into prison; Peter and Paul were there a long time anJ He sent His angel to stay with them." "He will send His angel here too if you ask Him. Roby," said Mr. Norton.' "Won't yo;i ask Him, please." And John knelt down and poured forth an earnest, simple prayer so filll of tender- ness and feeling, with such touching remem- branchs for them all, that even Donohue was moved, and the fierce look in Meg's eyes had softened. The weeks went on, Spring deepened into summer and the June days that dropped so softly with sunshine and blossoms brought Gertrude a wealth of happiness she never dreamed of before. There were higher hopes and truer aims in all her ways of thinking now, and she looked back with a sort of amaze to those bitter, reckless days. It was t so easy to be good with John for a helper, that she used to laughingly tell him, he had ex- ercised to evil spirits, and called back the t Gerda of olden days, while he grew braver r and nobler, with a freshness in his soul and I a gladness in his heart that glorified the r whole routine of daily work. Lifestretched  away into the grandest possibilities and 3 John Norton felt able to match and cope F with any foe. At first Mr. Ruthven was 4is-     posed to question the wisdom of Gertrude's choice. A young lawyerwith more brains than wealth, while he might be a most agreeable companion was rather a questionable suitor. But Gertrude showed so much spirit in the matter that her uncle had the good sense to yield without coming to any open issue, though he scarce forgave John Norton. June passed away, and July came with sultry days, and breathless nights. The Ruthvens had left for Newport the first of the month, and John found himself growing very restless and impatientof his intense and wering study and the hot dusty city. But stay he must. though his dreims throbbed with the pulses of the ocean, and every breath of air brought siren voices of witch- ery and allurement from the cool deep sea. One of the warmest days in July had just closed, when John left his office in search of an im, ortant witness in a suit then pend- ing. A member of the secret police, a man by the name of lacket, joined him as he left Broadway. He was a favorite of John's and often of great service in putting him in possession of fcts that he could reach in no other way. For keenness, sagacity, for quick insight into character, he had few equals in the city. The twilight was already fading and the hazy air seemed to give a peculiar depth to the shadows in the narrow street through which they were threading their way. As they reached the East river, two men stepped out from under a high building into the open street, and stood conversing in a low rapid tone. They both spoke French, and the night was so still that John and his com- panion could catch every tone of their voi- ces. John scarcely noticed them, and would have passed on, but Hacket motioned him to stop and both stepped close under the build- ing, while the officer listened with the air of a man whose every faculty had suddenly opened an ear. John listened too, and though his knowledge of French was too imperfect to catch the meaning of every word, still he could understand enough to make him start with a sort of wonder and amaze. He heard his own name with hints and surmises that the wildest conjecture could not unra- vel. He evidently was concerned in some- thing that interested them deeply, and from their earnest tone he was sure it was a mat- ter of the greatest importance. But how he was linked with such rough, reckless looking  men as these were, and how they should be  so conversant with his private' concerns, ] was entirely beyond his comprehension, E and there was something tantalizingly fam-  iliar about the voice and manner of one of 1 the speakers. yet the blue blouse and over- alls were strange as the owner. The per-  fect seclusion of the place, the absence of all posers, the heavy shadow of the great ware- 1 house under which they stood, the broad, y   dark river drifting past them, that must be silent whether it willed or not, made it just the spot for any deep intrigue. So it seem- ed to John Norton as he held his breath and listened. At length one of the speakers turned toward him, and he saw to his amaze the same face that had startled them all at Mr. Ruthven's window that stormy March night of Anne's reception. It was Jolibert. He had not forgotten that dark, hatefullook and here it was again. He was a short man dressed like his companion in blouse and overalls, with nothing remarkable except his singular face. He had lost one eye but the other blazed with a flash and fire that made John feel that he would be a hateful customer to meet alone, even at that time of night. The whole expression of the face was so full of cunning and treachery that John did not wonder at Gertrude Morrison's antipathy. The lips were shaded by a heavy moustache which twitched up and down, in a restless, excited way, and gave him at times a most savage uncomfortable look.  In a few moments a third person joined them, and the three walked away. When they were out of hearing II cket spoke: "Norton, what are youe ,ing that these fellows are concerned in? They are very much troubled about your proceedings. By the by. I believe I have it, and it' I've got the right key, I'll show them a dodge they don't expect. That short man I would like to serve." "Who are they and what do you know about them," asked John eagerly. "One of them is a Frenchman, answering to half a dozen nsmes, but usually known as Jolibert, a keen, sly rascal whom we have spotted times without number, but we can never get evidence enough to convict him. I have my suspicions that hbe knows more about some of the doings of the past six months than he'd care to tell." 'How does he come to know anything about my affairs, that's what confounds me" said John. '"I am sure I don't know." '"But who is the other? I must have seen him or heard him speak." "Yes, you know him, I saw him walking with you about a fortnight since, I asked you his name, his face struck me curiously. Ruthven, J think you called him," was Hack et's answer. '"Mark Ruthven!" exclaimed John in ut- ter astonishment. Why Mark is at New- port and has not been in town since that day you saw us together. You are certain- ly mistaken for what could Mark mean by such a masquerade, and though he is a wild fellow he never keeps such company as this." iPerhaps I am mistaken," replied Hacket "but there was a shrug of the shoulders and a motion of the fingers so like your friend's. Watching staggs is a part of our business you know."   John was painfully conscious of the re- semblance and for the next hour was more i troubled and more annoyed than he often t allowed himself to be, but a batch of New-  port letters and two old friends from his b home in Boston, made him quito forget his  evenings adventure, and the next day he X was so busy that not until late in the after- a noon as he was walking up Fifth Avenue, ] and spied Mark driving leisurely alung, did i it come b ack and then it passed away as a  wild fancy of Hackett's busy brain. What  could his handsome. graceful friend who had  the finest horses, and most elegant turnout on the street have in common with such a man as Jolibert. Mark invited him to a ride. "Where did you drop from!" exclaimed John. "I'm just over from Newport, I had busi- ness. I go back to-night." And then followed all the Newport news and gossip concerning those in whom John was most interested. As they reached Cen- tral Park two ladies dressed in deep mourn- ing drove past them and bowed to Mark. John asked who they were. "Morley's mother and sister, they have not been out of town I believe. Norton what possesses you to have anything to do with that Donohue affair. 1 heard at New- port that you were to appear as his defen- dant. What do you expect to make out of it." "The best I can," answered John, "but I fear it will go hard with them I can get very little that is in their favor, in fact, much against them, but I am certain of their innocence. I have the conviction, that is all." 'You had betterdrop it Norton,for whatever the decision may be you wont get any thanks from any bodyl. 'hese chvalrous ideas about defending the poor and persecl'ed, read well enough iu books but they d-)u't pay in real lite. You'll be dubbed a fool for your pains in worldly parlance. Take my advice and drop the whole concern," said Mark. "No Mark, I have gone too far and those poor people have set their hearts upon me. I cannot disappoint them. You and I, Mark, look at things from such different stand points that we cannot fairly judge of each others conduct. I must live up to my convictions of right if I suffer for it, and be- cause the public have condemned these peo- ple without a hearing,it is no reason I should throw stones." "Just as you please it is nothing to me," replied Mark indifferently, and the conver- sation turned into another channel. What John Norton bad said to Mark was his honest opinion in regard to Donohue's chances of escape. They seemed more and more hopeless and while he strove to cheer and comfort them all he-could, he never con- cealed the possibility of failure.   To Donohue it seemed a matter of perfect indifference, for John had seldom been able to rouse him from the sullen apathy that be- clouded him. He didn't eare. they might hang him. But to Meg, the hope of Roby's escape was fast becoming the great thought ofher life. She spent all the time she was allowed with Roby. It was touching to see how entirely her life was becoming absorbed in him, and as her hold on the outer world loosed, how his ways of thinking were grow- ing-into her heart. Whether the sudden consciousness of his  danger  had awakened ali the mother's nature, or the quiet of those long prison days had given time to the poor, bewildered soul to bettle itself and find its bearings one cannot tell. Certainly Meg was different, and the reckless defiant woman who flung back scorn for scorn, had grown so patient and gentle that Bill anc Lucywere in a state of wonderment. She would listen to Roby's entreaties to leave her old associates and lead a better life in a way that surprised him, and eyen John was more touched than ever by a love so enduring and earnest. Bat after all the secret and sustaining power of the woman's soul was the hope of Roby's acquittal. Let this ail her and all was lost. Meg had much to learn yet. Hu- man hands must grow utterly weary andhu- mau hearts utterly faint before the hands will grasp, or the heart receive the infinite, All-powerful Saviour. The summer days went on and Septembier was close at hand. One afternoon as John was approaching his office he overtook Meg and Bill Jarvis. Meg was talking in a ,erce passionate way about somethinig lcy had said in regard to Roby's chances Coescape. "Mr. N orton can save him"Bill eplied. "No he cant, unless be has more proof, he said so. If you were half a man you would n't lie round here'idle, you'd find what he wanted if yoh had to die lor itfc "Meg," replied Bill slowly, 'I believe I would die for ye if that could help ye, my life aint much account." "Noit aint worth 'alfas much as his,' Meg  answered  quickly and  walked awav. Bill stood for a moment wholly absorbed by some thought, and after a pause, he said slowly: "I dont care if he does kill me, I'll do it. May be she'd think I was woth somethin then," he added in an undertone and disap- peared. lNeither of them had noticed John Norton. At his office he found a telegram from New- port announcing that Arthur had been seiz- ed with a sudden and violent hemorrhage and could not live but a few hours. If John saw him alive he must come over im- mediately. That evening found him at Newport. Mr. Ruthven and Anne were perfectly crushed, and seemed so utterly hearthroken, that     John wa3 quite overcome by the meeting. Gertrude was the only one who maintained sufficient composure to be of any real ser- vice to Arthur. She had not left his bedside for a moment and not until she was alone with John, did her fortitude fail her, and then she sobbed as if every hope in life was gone. She had never known any brother but Arthur, and he was the only one in her uncle's family witlihwhom she had much in common, while he lavished upon her all the affection and tenderness his loving na- ture was capable of. When Gertrude was calmn they both re- turned to Arthur's room, and the night they spent there was not soon forgotten by eith- er. The summons that brought such dis- may and anguish to them was God's benison   of peace to him, and already the glory of the other world had entered in and transfig- ured this. Arthur's conflict had been ,end- ed long ago, and there was nothing now but words of triumph and victory, words that, days after, when the darkness lay so heavy about these who watched, came back like messages from another world. At length the morning broke, and with its first touch of' light Arthur Ruthven pass- ed away leaving those who loved him best in the anguish and desolation of this great sorrow. John went back with them to New York and after the funeral was over return- ed to his office and his work with the feel- ing of a man whose hold on life had been suddenly loosened and he was drifting, he scarce knew where.   CHAPTER VI. It was late in the afternoon a week after John Norton's return that he sat in his office busy with his papers, when Bill Jarvis en- tered. He looked around cauticusly and then closed all the doors. Evidently he had something important on his mind for he hitched and twisted himself about in a most restless sort ot way. At last he said. "Nobody can hear us." "'No;" replied John. "I've soinmthin to tell ye. It arent Done- hue and R)by wat killed Mr. Morley. liHe said he'd kill me i I totle bur I dont care; dyin's only goin to sleep, an if we dont wake up no more it aint so bad. Meg says so, and Meg oughter know. Meg was allers so good to me, an if I could save Roby I'd be woth somethin and do more dyin, as I have livin; if I was sure about the sleepin I wouldn't care," and he drew a long sigh. "What do you mean?" said John at last, "if you know anything that will help) Roby, tell me in a straightforward way." But it wasn't easy for Bill to be straight- forward. His ideas came slowly and the threat that endangered his life. seemed to quite bewilder him, while the half numbed consciousness of another life was putting out its trembling feelers in the dread of sudden death. It needed much patience on the part of John to arrive at a clear statement -of what Bill had to say, but at last he put it all   down in writing and Bill assented to every word. The night o', the Morley murder Jarvis was walking along quite out .of the city near Donohue's hoiuse, when Mr. Mor- lev whom he know well by sight came past him with two other men. Onewas Jolibert. He had often seen him and once or twice did some work ito him, the other was a gentle- man young and handsome like Mr. Morley, he wouldn't know him again. They were all very angry and just as they passed him Jolibert drew a knife and stabbed Morley, and as he fell his companion said: "We are safe enough, Donohue will hang for this, and we are free too." Bill started and ran, and the others walk- ed on, 6ut JoliDert saw him and threatened him if h1o ever. breathed a word or what he had seen lie would kill him instantly and Bill bolieved it, and his love for Meg and his terror of death had' been strug'gling to- gether all the summer long. He thought he was safe when Mr. Norton took the case, but Meg's words in the street and Roby's evident danger had brought him here. John could scarcely quiet the poor, tremb- ling fellow, or persuade him that it was not his last night on earth. "If anythin comes to me, ye'll tell Meg, and maybe she'll think better on me dyin, as she does livin."          * I- As Bill left the office Hackett entered. John told him what he had just heard. :'I suspected as much, and now that gives the key to the night talk we heard. How-   -ever we have something to corroborate this man's stry. We have known for. it long time tihatthet-e were a gang of counterfeiters in this city, whose headquarters were in Par- is, but we could never track them. Now one of them who was arrested lately for larceny had just quarrelled with Jolibert, and by confession implicated the w hole gang. Jol- ibert will be safe enough soon and half a dozen others. He told me enough to make me suspect that Jolibert was connected with that Morley affair. They were all together, Morley, Ruthven and Jolibert. They had a quarltastt spring just before the elder Ruatven came back from Europe and this ,yonug man wanted to leave the concern. 'There were high wordsthen but they did not ipart, as Morley would not release Ruthven without a bonus which he could not raise. 'Morley was deepest in the business, but he ;managed to use the others, while he pocket *ed the most of the gains, holding the threat ,of exposure over Ruthven's head all the time. He himself managed so adroitly that ,he never would have been convicted come ,what might. If you follow up this track you \will probably find that this Jarvis' story is true. and Jolibert and Ruthven are the ones ,concerned, not your clients. I suspected the 'whole thing from that talk we overheard and I have been waiting for somethihg more cer- tain. It is clear as daylight now, all you ,have to do is to go ahead." '"Is there evidence strong enough to con- vict Ruthven in this counterfeiting business'. John asked. "No, nolhing certaiu, and the chances are that his position is such that the courtf will lot him slide. Anyhow many a rascal slips out in that way. What is the matteri' Norton?" John replied it a qldick way: "This Donohue case, I can't go on with it if Mark is anyway concerned, why they are I my best friends." "Then Donohue and Burns must sufiter I 1 fear, for I know of no one but yourself who - could fe el interest enough in them to prose- c cute the case against such odds. They will i thring everything to bear to save those meni.  There is no doubt of Jolibert and Ruthven hbeing arrested for that murder. We shall t go ahead if you don't, and if you are the v man I have taken you for, you won't let the I innocent suffer. lRuthven imav not be guilty a but I have suspected him of something ever it since I asked you his name. Hie has looked s like a man tunder a sentence. Haven't you c noticed any difference?"  John said nothing, but all the little inci- n dents of the past summer rushed back. The s afternoon at Goupil's, the evening of the re- t ception, the haggard, restless look his face fi now habitually wore, except when excited d in conversation. Things he had scarcely . thought of, his talk in Central Park. all told d against him now. "I catVt do.  it, I can't do it. no! no! xQi v   NOT' and John buried his face in, his hands. Hackett arose quietly and left, while John sat in the same place stunned and be- wilde-red. What could he do? He had come to one of those bitter and cruel crises in life that chill the heart and make the very brain reel with doubt and uncertainty, while he was a man not easily daunted nor overcome, his earnest sympathic nature made him cruelly sensitive to the opposing forces that seemed to hdld possession of his soul. He could make no compromise, for the power that stood before him demanded the whole. Could he give it? It was indeed the great hour of John's life, and on the simple settlement of this question might hang his whole future. Just here many a man and woman have lost their all and been trampled down only' to rise maimed and distorted forever, for such con- flicts are one of Christ's great tests of disci- pleship, and sooner or later, every soul that chooses Him for a Captain, fights out the battle that He fought and won, years ago in the solitude and desolation of the wilderness and he is a hero indeed who comes off victor in those silent, terrible conflicts that no human eye sees, or human ear hears John was weak and weary with the grief and excitement of the past week and was illy prepared to think calmly or quietly on any subject. He needed rest and was half resolved to postpone the decision until the next day. But the battle had already com- menced, and no power he possessed could arrest it now. The two issues stood before him; on one side Gertrude and all that the world could hold for him of happiness, hon- or, wealth and position. The golden days floated by him with their glorious possibili- ties and lovely voices of allurement and promise called to him from their dreamy depths. On he other side was Meg and Ro- by, .i cuase whose success or failute seemed evenly balanced, and in either case he gain- ed only the consciousness of trying to per- form a doubtful duty, while helost all that made life worth the living. No; he could not do it and give up Ger- trude. lie knew well enough that theRuth- rvn pride would flash into fire, should that 4ew reused in any attempt to convict Mark, and though she might and did love him bet- ter than any one else in the world she would sneer and scot rn the paltry excuse of prin- ciple in a matter that struck such a blow at  the family. She must cling to them, partic- ularly since a common grief brought them so close together, and how could he break their hearts under these peculiar and pain- fil circumstances. No, some one else must do it. And then the pleading voices on the other side came in. The helplessness and: dependence of his clients, their perfec t faith in him, and then Meg's hope of reform thiaf: was to come through Robv's release and the     broken, aimless life of Donohue that was g just beginning to revive; and Roby, too, . could he leave the boy whose heart he had c won so entirely? John knew he was inno- t cent, and who could'or would do for thelm as  he might. Would a stranger care lfor them or a would there be any to place himnself in op- i position to the force that would -l arrayedi against him? It was very doubtful, and yet, , it was terrible to be brought aco to ftce a with either decision. The hours went by, twelve o'clock came, 1 and yet John was no ne:arer the point tha a: before, All that he could see were two faces Gertrude's and Meg's. One so perlfect. so  beautiful, with all its glorious pos;sibilitics  flashing from it, radiant \Nith love El:,r him and growing nobler and more earnest under his guidance and care. The other marred! and broken, only the wreck of what it ot hit. to be, with its passionate. pleading ox es, and all the mother's better nature lighting it t ip, and hinting what it might be, were ib re- deemed and sanctified. There they were. and the whole future of his life w-as linked with one or the other. Two o'clock, three o'clock. Meg's face is beginning to fade, aiid the lighit has center- ed on Gertrude. At last it vanishes entire- ly, Iohn Norton has chosen. God help you l Meg, for where will you t ir n ow? What- ever the result of his decision might bh,. :it least there was a lull in the light. and bho had time to go step by step over the ground and satisfy himself that he had chosen wisely and well. His best friends wotthl tell hitn so, and even his enemies could scarcely re- proach him under circumnstances sopecuilar. Why should he choose to set up as an exam- pie, only to be -sneered at as a tool'.' An ol- der man might run the risk; hc had a nanme and a place to make yet. and prudence and caution were the wisest guides. An, then Roby and Donohue might esc ape after all. He was not the only man w% ho had the inter- ests of the poor or unfortiunate at heart, and another could advocate their cause monure successfully, one who had nothing to hold him back. He could not have done them justice; it was better for them that lie h;itt dropped it; he knew he could pirsuade Rouby to think so. and Meg, and Donohue would understand it after a while; they wohuld 1b, be satisfied. At length he rose and opened his office door and went down into' Broad- way, and walked away with a quick step. It was almost sunrise. and, before lie e kiiew it, he was at the Staten Island Ferry. lie passed on to the boat injust as it left the wharf careless where he went if he only might for- get himself, for the old conflict was rcnew- ed again with a fier fury than ever. In- stead of finding quiet from his decision it seemed only to add to'the bitterness of the fight. Had a thousand devils waked  p': Were the taunting, mocking voices that came to him, his own fancy, or had heo beoo banded over, soul and body to Satan? .\   gate was opening that he never dreamed of before, and through its widening portals a crowd of suggestions winged theif way only to be joiutedby those that swept up from his own soul. And yet the morning lay so still about him., the early dawn was slowly creep- ing in. and the bay grew luminous beneath its touches. 'Whit,-wiiig'ed sails were tinted and rosy as they came from out the shadows and the sotl cloud:s above the city caught and held the sweet light. Then the first "ght gleaim of' sunshine shot from the East, and another, and another, till the brilliant foliage of the distaint landscape broke into ilaiec, and every window blated with the ila h of a sudden illumination. Tlhe chanvge was so quiet. not Ia ripple slirred, nt a leaf' moved, and yet the whole worldi had cotie 'fro0. darkneds into light. !ohnll,-as scarcely conscious of any outward thing till the boat ,ioplped at the Island, and then the hurry and buistle of passengers go- itry over to New York brought- hinm to his senses. he was in uno mood obr talking, so he muadle his' way to the stern of the boat and hero fouinm hiiself quite alu'e. -Not long after they starred, lihe noticed a 'woman not lar froni hun reading a little book, her face was turned away butt the voice was very taituiiar as she rea l, hall aloud.

She liad hired a stand at the IFultont t. Market and now that [ouby was.- well againt sold fruit there morninogsi spending hter afternoons with her' )oy.

She looked so haggard and worn that John knew from her face how terrible the strugrle bett ei Te 1'c-r love for her' bocy and the cray-   ing for the oldexcitement must be, At length she said: "We h'aiut seen you for a long time, Yout aint going to leave Roby are 'yolu?" 'I have been in great trouble," John re- plied. "I have lost a dear friend," and then to turn the conversation lit asked her whlat she was reading. T;Roby's testament. he says ['1l1 be :-af' when I have it; I was jtl, reading a chapter he likes, for he says it, is all aboust you. Maybe yvou'd like to listen, sir, for h wants it most every day. John assented, scarcely caring ' what he did and Meg commenced that wonderful description Christ has given of the La:st Judgemeit: "'When the Son ol' Man shall come in His glory and all the holy angels with Him, then shall he sit umpou the throne of his glory. "And before him shall be gathered ail na- tions. and-he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheepl, from the goats. ' And he shall set the sheep ota his right hand, but the goats on his left. '"Then shall the Kling say uto thema on his right hand: Come ye blessed of my Fa- ther onte' the kingdom prepared fir you from the foundation of' the world. "'For I was an hungered, and ye gave meo meat; I was thirsty and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger and yet took me in. '"I was naked and ye clothed ime: i was sick and ye visited me; I was in prison and ve came unto me.' ;'Then shall the righteous anmswer him say- ing: Lord when saw we thee an hiungered and fed thee, or thirsty and gave thee drink? '"When saw we thee a stranger and took thee in, or naked and clothed thee; or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came un- to thee? "And the King shall answer and say unto them: Verily I say unto you inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me,.'" The slow, earnest way in which Meg read this passage gave a peculiar force to the words, and when she finished .with this verse, John dropped his ,.ead and groaned alomd, Meg started. "1 am sick, leave me," he said. And as she .went to the other end of tlit boat, John hid his face in his cloak.. It seemed as if Christ had stood beforte hinm and every word fell from his lips. It did not need much thinking to follow this chap- t4'r to the close, and hear that fearfidl sei- tence:   "Depart, because ye did it not unto the least of thcse."' 'This was the test, and what had he done but turn coward and fly at the first assault. Ho who had been so brave and fearless, glorying in the thought of trials and conflicts for Christ. No wonder that Gertrude told hinm that he knew nothing of temptation, or nothing of hls weakness. The veriest child was stronger than he. Even this poor wo- man with all her undisciplined passions was far beyond him, she could check and control them for the sake of her boy, while he- for whom  Christ had aim infinite love eould make no denial of self. It was very clefar now what his duty was in this matter, and with tears and prayers of penitence and contrition didI he plead for forgivenness and strenmgth. The conflict was over and Christ had given hiin the victory. It was a pale. haggard man who stepped offt tie boat at New York; one who looked us it' be hiad been within the shadow of an- other world. lie went back to his office, and locking the door sat down quietly and reviewed his night'i work. He stood' on a dliffitent stand-point now. and the things of this wotrld seened swept away, and swallow edi up in the lifle to come. 'rile drew a little picturei of Gertrude fom - his bosom, and pressed it to his sobbing lips, and then came one of those'sudden exaltations and thrills of feeling that often follow such a crisib as this that John Norton hatd just passed.. Love and all that was worth loving grew immor- tal, life was but a moment and the glory and blessedness of that eternity,- when Churist's redeemed shall be together forever, filled his soul and swept away every other thought. As he was leaving his boarding house at noon lie caught sight of Hackett who stop- ped for hiff. He answered John's inquiring look: "'Yes, they haveboth been arrested; Jolibert has a gooddeal of bravado about him, but Rutliven is completely broken up. Are you going on with it?" "Yes," wa-s the quiet answer. Hackett added: "I can put you in the way of much you want then. I will come in this afternoon." John went back to his room and wrote Gertrude a simple, earnest statement of the whole matter and his convictions 'of dity, and left it to her to choose whether she would still be bound to him or be free. The letter overflowed with the deepest, truest love, .a love that would' think no ill of her, do what she might, He sealed it, sent it, and then went to his ofice to meet Hackett.     CHAPTEIR VII, The September morning that had witness- ed John Norton's struggle and victory came softly into Gertrude's room, but it brought no message from the outer world, save those of the sweet sunshine. She arose, dressed herself quickly, and went down into the gar- den to arrange some flowers for Arthur's grave. Every morning since the funeral she had carried these sweet remembrances there, and now that John expected to meet her at the Ferry and go with her, she had appoint- ed an early hour to suit his convenience. There was no one awake in the house, and the garden beyond lay still with the early sunshine of the morning upon it. The teats fell fast as Gertrude gathered the rosebuds and the white pansies. They were Arthur's favorite flowers and not one of them but was linked with the sweetest associations of his presence and care. It was sweet that they should rest above him now; for a life so love- ly, a death so full of peace, could have no better type than their delicate beauty and rare perfume. It was a strange, a wonder- ful experience to Gertrude, this opening of the gate into the new world of sorrow, a gate alas, that never closes again, or lets you back into the old freshness and sunlightand the eyes were deep with the questionings no human lips could answer, and the heart full of longings no human soul could satisfy. A shadow fell upon the balcony and a light step made her look up; to her surprise she saw Mark. It was the first time he had been at the house since the funeral. he was dressed for travelling, and evidently did not notice her till he was close beside her. "Why Gerda, I did not suppose there was any one up. You are an early riser." 'Yes," she answered, "for the past few mornings. I wanted these for Arthur," and she held up the basket of flowers which she had just commenced arranging. As he bent down over them, she saw how pale and weary he looked. 'Why Mark, you are sick!" she exclaimed rising and standing beside hitn. "Oh no," he answered carelessly, "it is this uncertain light. I am well, but worn out and troubled with business. I haven't been abed to-night. I don't know exactly what strange impulse brought me back here. I ought to have been away in the early train. Don't look so grave little lady, I'm not sick." "I can't help it," Gertrude answered. "It seems as if every one I loved could die so easily, now that Arthur is gone," and the tears tell unchecked. Mark was silent for a moment and lit his lips as if struggling with some strong emo- tion, but when he spoke it was as coolly and quietly as ever.   "1 shall be away for a long time, proba- bly till Spring. You will be gone from helr beibfore I return, and it may be a great while before we see each other again. Promise me one thing, Gerda, that if you think of me at all it shall be at my best, always at my best." The wondering look deepened in Gertrude's eyes, but before she had time to speak, he softly pressed his lips to her's, plucked a rosebud from the basket beside her and dis- appeared. There was something behind all this that she could not understand. Mark was in great trouble, but from whiolloure she could not. divine, and as she ha i'ty finished her work, she almost forgot her grief for-Ar- thur in her anxiety for Mark. Not that she had ever loved him as she did the rest of the famlily, :bllt he was associated with some of the pleasantest hours of her life, and then his thoughtfulness and a;tentioni to ,Arthur would have endeared him now if there was nothing besides. John did not meqet her at the Ferry as she expected, antl the long ride and solitary visit were so disappointing that she sobbed beside Arthur's gradve with a bitterness and anguish she never knew before. When Mr. Rtuthven came home to dinner that afternoon he brought a couple of old Irlendls with him, gentlemen who had trav- elled with them an 'were stopping in the city for a few days, and as Gertrude came down the broad stairway to enter the draw- ing-room, a servant handed her John's letter. She stepped back to be out of the range of the guests, and stood under a side light where she might read it unobserved. It did not take many minutes to comprehend it. The interview with Mark in the morning, and John's lailure to appear, together with the wearying task of receiving visitors all the afternoon had wrought Gertrude to the highest key. Every nerve was keen and luivering, every instinct was on the alert, and when she folded the letter and put it into her pocket it seemed as if a whole eter- nity must have passed since she opened it. She did not faint nor cry out. but after a few moments went into the drawing room as quiet and self-possessed as ever. What passed in the next few hours she never fully knew. The present, the actual, the visible had been suddenly cut away, and she watch- ed it floating farther and farther from her as one in a dream, growing all the time less and less sure of herself and her connection with it, and keeping tp this curious inward study while the outward talk went on. Fortun- ately for her all the associations with these friemlds lay abroad, and the easy, good-na- tured gentleman who escorted her to dinner, was so fond of listening to his own conversa- tion that she needed to say but little, and   there was no one who would be likely to watch ier, or comment upon her silence. At last dinner was over and as they return- ed to the drawing room, Gertrude heard a sharp ring at the door, and a low voice ask for Mr. Ruthven. He stepped into the hall, Gertrude did not hear the conversation but a quick. angry exclamation from her uncle assured her that her presentiment was cor- rect when she heard the inquiry for him. Some friend had brought the fatal news. If it troubled him he did not show it, and she envied the c3olness that could talk so care- lessly to his guests. At last they were all gone. Mr. Rulthven, Anne and Gertrude were alone. "I want to see both of you in the library," he said, leading the way to the room. When the door was closed he drew a note from his pocket and handed it to Gertrude, saying: "Do you know anything about this?" It was from Mark. Only these words: 'I am arresied for the Morley murder. John Norton is at the bottom of it." Mr. Ruthven corztinued: "Mr. Newman my lawyer brought it; Mark sent for him. fie told me more than it is well for you girls to know, but Mark might have escaped this, had Norton not de- termined"to ruin him; he always hated him. Newman says that he is none too good him- self, and if the, truth were known there would be more reason for his taking up the cause of such a profligate set than we be- lieve. If Mark has got into any scrape Newman don't think it will go hard with him, he must be saved. The boy has been a sad scamp and I'll ship him whfen this is over; but he is better than Norton; there is no hypocrite about him. It seems that there is a woman, a'most notorious wretch, mixed up with this affair, and John Norton has got to pay pretty dear for his scrapes." Mr. Ruthven was outwardly cool, but the fire was at white heat within. He always spoke in a decided way. but the words now were flung out like hot shot. Gertrude had held Mark's note, listening, but scarce comprehending all this while, till this last, cruel stab. All the woman now flashed in her pale face, as she rose and came to where her uncle stood, saying: "Uncle Ruthven you shall take back ev- ery one of those words. John Norton may be mistaken in what does, but I cannot tell. He has always been true to me..always, and you know it. God is his witness that he has never wronged me by word or thought, and never could; and if you say such a th ng again I shall leave this house!" "Ah, ah," said Anne sneeringly, "your saint isn't quite perfect. It is a dastardly thing to attack his best friends in this way. I thought better of John Norton, though I didn't believe he was so much above the rest of the world as you did. However one finds out people after a while, and Mr. Norton with his high flown notions isn't so far be-   yond ts after all. I suppose he puts this handsome piece of business on the ground of principle. "Principle!" exclaimed Mr. Ruthven, get- ting more and more excited as he walked up and down the room, "'beautiful principle. I'll ruin him principle and all. If that's the way principle acts, the less of it the better. Gertrude if you have anything to do with him you shall be shut up, and kept on bread and water. Leave the house, that is what you'd like, ard go to your saint. But you won't do it; I'll watch you and Ill ruin him if it takes all my time and every cent I've got. The hypocrite, to come into the house and turn against us In this way. Mark shall escape if it is for nothing bu to spite John Norton." He had not noticed that the face beside him grew whiter and whiter, and at last it sank perfectly colorless 'on the floor. The cord was drawn to its utmost tension. Ger- trude had fainted. They carried her to her own room, and the old nurse who had watched her in child- hood sat by her now. She did not open her eyes, nor speak for hours, and then she only asked where she was and closed them again. It was late in the forenoon before Gertrude fully came to her consciousness, and one by one the strange figures in the terrible scenes of the past night came slowly out from the mist. She asked for John's letter which was brought her, and reading and re-reading it, began to unlerstand things in their true light. John could not have done otherwise, and still been true to himself and his faith, and the conversation on the first evening that they were both together after their re- turn, was very fresh. now. He. had been tested and had not failed, thank God. Even though her tears fell like rain there was a wonderful sense of rest in the thought that John had not failed. There was some- thing above and beyond mere worldliness; not a vague shadowy dream as she once thought it, but a reality that made every- thing elseseem dim and mist-like. She could anchor her troubled and storm-tossed boat fast to the eternal rock, and though the waves hid it again and again, she was safe. What she ought to do in this matter she could not tell, but would wait, assured that- some way she would be guided aright. In the month that intervened between that eventful September morning and the trial, John Norton had too much real earnest work to allow any thought of himself: For the time the intensity of the present swept out and covered the whole past and fiuture. The day for the trial came at last and he found himself face to face with the most adroit and unscrupulous talent of the city, men that would hesitate at no means if they could on- ly win. It was a trying place for a young man, and another time John Norton might have faltered; but one who had fought the battle he had just ended, and come off victor     in that higher conflict need have no fear of mortal foes. In truth he had none, he was above and beyond them now, and it was not long before his opponents felt this, and saw for once in their lives how all the influ- ence of worldly position. the power of wealth the legerdemain and trickery of the profes- sion can he shrivelled up and swept away before God's simple truth and justice in the hands of an honest fearless man. They might plead as they would. it was all in vain, and after a week of the hardest work John Norton ever did, he had won his suit. and Jolibert and Ruthven were convicted of Morley's murder. So at last Donohue and Roby were free. Meg sobbed aloud in the wildness of her joy, and overwhelmed Bill with so much atten- tion that the poor fellow was quite distract- ed. There was great congratulation among Johns friends on his success. and no little surprise when they found he had secretly left the court room, and gone, no one knew exactly where, for the gas was unlighted in his room and the repeated knocks unanswer- ed. He had eluded Meg and Donohlue and now sat before the fire in his darkened room worn out and completely unnerved with the strain of the past few weeks. He had battled against fearful odds and won the vic- tory, but it brought him no joy. He could only think of the desolation and heart break of uhose he loved. He had never heard a word from Gertrude; he had no reason to ex- pect it, for his friends were free to tell hin of the bitterness and scorn the Ruthvens felt. There had been neither word of sympathy or help for John all these weary days, and he knew enough of the world to understand how much of the popular synmpathy and pop- ular feeling would side with wealth and po- sition even were they the blackest of sinners yet he had been pained to the heart by the utter misconception that many chose to give to his motives, and now to-night he felt so desolate he could have sobbed aloud. All the sweet days of the past came back linked together and twined about with  the thought of but one name, but one face, and had put him utterly away. He could not think, he could not pray. Itad Christ de- serted him too in this hour of pitiful need? So he almost thought as he fancied the taunt ing, mocking fiends were glorying in his weakness and misery. It was a long time before John came fully into the quiet and peace of God, but at last he was satisfied. The traces of carnage and blood on earthly battle-fields are hidden away by nature with the utmost care, but even she has to wait for sunshine and rain, spring-timne and har- vest before the freshness and Jbeauty of the landscape return. In those other conflicts, where the marks of the fight are more dead- ly, and the stains deep(r, there must be pa- tient waiting also, till the old forces have time to renew themselves, and life re-learns its early song of gladness. John's first   thought was of Meg and Roby. Donohue had shipped for California, and through the kindness of a friend he was able to find a place out of New York where Meg could comfortably support herself and her boy. Here he left them with the earnest belief that her good resolutions would not fail her. Ro- by had been her safeguard so long that now she was removed from her old associations, there was a strong probability that she might be true to the better nature just awakened. Still John knew that unless she had help firom some higher source than herself; the impression that had been inwrought by her anxiAty and suffering for Roby, would prove a poor defence against the assault of sudden temptation. In the monhs that passed Meg proved herself worthy of John's trust, thougtl he did not see her again till he was was sent for to receive Roby's last messages of gratitude and love, but it was only by her dying boy that Meg's redemption surely came, and the hope of a better life that was born with her child, the hope that had nev- er quite vanished was now realized as she saw him die. The earthly helper had fail- ed, but the infinite hand that she once drea- med stretched out to her through the dark- ness came to her in reality; and utterly help less and heart-broken she was ready to grasp it. Ever after as ia timid, trusting child,she walked where it led, redeeming the past by a lifeo1f penitence and devotion to her Sa- vior. When all Mr. Ruthven's efforts to secure Mark's pardQn failed, and it was certain that there was nothing before him but long years of prison life, his uncle resolved to go abroad. He disposed of everything that te possessed and concluded to join his brother's family who were just sailing for Europe. When John heard of this he could scarce resist the temptation to see Gertrude again. At length the day came for them to sail and John resolved to catch one more glimpse of his darling. He stood on the wharf that dark December day and watched the family alight from the carriage and go on board. Mr. Ruthven looked like a broken old man, and the ladies, of whom there were several in the paity, were robed in such deep mourn- inghe could not catch a glimpse of their fa- ces. The plank was drawn, the great en- gine heaved and puffed, they were away. Gertrude was gone forever. Oh how bitter and blank life seemed; gone forever, and not a word of pa;ting. The day was sp chill and dark, the city looked so desolate, turn where he would. lle wandered up and down for a while, and at last he resolved to go resolutely to work.- On his office lablehe fouud a little note from an old friend, a Mrs. Allen whom lie used often to visit with Ger-- trude. It was an invitation to dinner and he soon found himself tn Mrs. Allen's cosy parlor. As he seated himself to wait for his hos- tess, his eye fell upon a picture of Gertrude   taken just before she sailed for Europe three years ago. It was so life-like that . he arse and went up to it, saying: 'Oh Gerda. Gerda, my darling, come back to me," and then stood watching its loveli- ness in the fading light. . He was not conscious of the presence of any one till a soft voice sal: -'John!" And he turned only to clasp Gertrlud in a maze of bewilderment and joy, and -heardl her murmur: ,'I thought you wanted ume nlore than any one else. so I staid." And Gertrude only knewhow ujcar heart- broken he had been, by the heavy sobs that came. Then by the sweet firelight, amid the deepening shadows the past was explain- ed. Geitrude told him the whole story of her   struggle between her duty to her uncle and her love for him. She had tried, when at last she fully decided what to do; to get some word to him but he was away from town, so making Mr. and Mrs. Allen her con- idalnts, the whole matter had been arranged. ler uncle's family did not know of her plans till they were ready to sail, and then their words of scorn and bitterness had al- mnost broken her heart. It was sad to part from them this way, but she could not leave John. There was ai quiet wedding that evening at tMrs. Allon's. and the next day John Nor- ton took his wife to his Boston home for a tew weeks. The years that followed were good. true years for both. as John and Ger- trude found thetselves purer in heart, and nobler in life for his conflict and victory.
