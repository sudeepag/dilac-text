E fMEARS, STEREOTYER,   THE MONARCHST; AN HSTORICAL NOVEL. CHAPTER I. The moon pours down her streams of silver light On the hushed landscape and the slumbering sea; No voice is heard but from the bird of night, No motion seen but on the quivering tree. *   * *.  *,   * At such an hour a sudden sound; The hoof of steed in eager bound- Perchance foretells some tidings near, To waken joy, or pale with fear. *   *   *   * Away! away! with main and might,- The work must be begun to-night! IT .was just when the twilight, of evening was about to be sud- ceeded by the darkness of a summer night, that the guests of the Inn at Pungoteague, on the eastern shore of Virginia, sitting on the broad porch in front of the house, were startled by the sounds of the hoofs of a horse which seemed to be urged forward impa- tiently by the rider. Mr. Hayley, the rubicund publican, and a sinner by confession, arose, descended a step downwards, and holding his hand over his eyes, strove to recognise the features of the one approaching, that he might be able toAnnounce his name to his guests. He was not long kept in suspense. "As I'm a sinner," said Hayley (an expression he often used), ' it is our pious parson, all the sway from Hungers' parish! What can bring him hither at such a killing pace, and in August, too?" "Hunting a stray sheep, I suppose;" said Mr. Thomas Custis, a young gentleman who sat with his three-cornered beaver cocked up behind, while the front was pulled low down over his eyes. He added, as the horseman began to moderate his pace upon drawing near, "  could not find one gone further astray than you, Hayley." 1 *     /      '        (5)     6         THE MONARCHST. "When he overtakes me, Tom, you will be found in the same vicinity," replied the publican; "but I suspect he comes to be ministered to by me, rather than to lead me back into his fold." - And so it proved. Upon dismounting, the reverend gentle- man gave his horse into the charge of the old negro who had answered the bell of the landlord, and after saluting the company in the formal mode of the time, desired to be conducted to the supper-table.  But before he was permitted to withdraw within the house, he, was plied with many questions by the half dozen men surround- ing him, with all of whom he was perfectly well acquainted. Nor could their eagerness to learn the news be at all restrained at that exciting time, when rumours of rebellion and civil war were rife throughout the colonies. "Gentlemen, gentlemen," responded Mr. Hewitt, " the news will be fo4bd bad enough-and that is not new, either; for when have we had other kind since Col. Washington was prevailed on, some five years ago, to offer in the house of Burgesses, the nbn- importation resolutions, written by his neighbour Mr. George Mason? Patrick Henry, Thomas Jefferson, Dabney Carr, and such mischief-makers, might have been frowned down by the high-toned gentlemen of the country; but when the Lees, Georgge. Washington, George Mason, Richard Bland, Peyton Randolph, Nicholas, Harrison, Tyler, Pendleton and Digges, take part in an evil movement, the consequences cannot be-otherwise than bad; very bad, gentlemen!"    . "What will be the consequences, think you?" asked young Custis. "Why, instead of having their actions celebrated and ap- plauded as were those of Brutus and Cromwell, which have so much excited the admiration of Patrick Henry, thdy will be more likely to meet the fate of Jack Cade and Wat Tyler!" This was pronounced by the reverend gentleman with solemn empha- sis. He was then cordially greeted by Mrs. Hayley, who had been awaiting him at the door, and who now conducted him to the tea table, where his reverend brother in the church, Mr. MacCoskie, and his clerk, Mast4Robert Wales, had continued sitting. after the other guests had risen. Not a word of contradiction, nor a syllable of condemnation, escaped the lips of any of the party in the porch who had listened to the decisive remarks of Mr. Hewitt. The agitators in Virginia at that period were all on the western shore, which was separated from the narrow peninsula, upon which the party introduced to the reader lived, by the broad Chesapeake   THE MONARCHST.           7 Bay. Vesels were continually crossing from one side to the other, it wsftrue.; but hitherto it had so happened that the ancient counties of Accomac and Northampton boasted of no prominent champion of the rights of the colonies in opposition to the so-called aggression and tyranny of the mother country. No one had felt any of the grievances complained of; none had perceived any indications of the determination of George III. to enslave them. If tea was taxed three pence per pound, the East India company had reduced the price exactly that much; and hence the loyal inhabitants of the eastern shore had not ceased to enjoy their accustomed beverage, notwithstanding the non-importation resolutions of the refractory Burgesses. In short, the idea of separation from the mother country, and inde- pendence, had never entered the minds of any of them; it was not even suggested by the Burgesses, constituting the famous committee of safety; and since the stamp act had been repealed, and the price of tea, lead, and paper not being oppressively high, though so monstrously taxed, as it was asserted, they might have glided along the stream of time as smoothly and as loyally, per- haps, as their ancestors had done, but for the impassioned spirits in the land restless for change, and reckless of consequences, when once fully embarked in the cause which inspired them. "Tom, do you know what was the fate of Cade and Tyler?" This question was asked by Harry Parker, a relative of young Custis, and about the same age. "They lost their heads; and if I recollect right, Brutus fared no better; and Cromwell's living terror was even worse than "What the deuce, then, I should like to know," observed Hayley, "are those fiery folks over the bay making such a 8sr about? Richard Henry Lee, I know, for the Hon. Mr. Robinson told me so, was once a most dutiful subject, as he declared him- self to be in many letters, when he applied to be made one of the King's Council. You are aware he was disappointed.' That affronted him, perhaps," remarked Mr. Richard Ayres, a farmer of middle age, but with a predilection for the company of the young men of fortune and family in the county, and a constant participator in their sports. -"The Hon. John Robinson is a high-spirited gentleman, and has redeemed all the paper money his friends were accommodated with the use of, out of his own private purse. Lee thought he had him in his power, be- cause as treasurer of the government he had not destroyed all the redeemed notes. But he knew his own business, and no man will dare to doubt his honour or word. If he says Lee     8         TIE MONARCHST. wanted to be one of the Council, that is enough. Robinson's father and your father, Tom, were first cousins." "But if that disappointment offended Lee," said Custis, "what has occurred to imbitter, Col. Washington?" "That's the mystery!" responded Hayley. "Who knows," he continued, after a pause, " whether Dinwiddie, Braddock, and other high-flown gentry from beyond the broad ocean may not have affronted him? Perhaps the King ought to have made him a knight; I think he ought to have done something of the kind, for his valiant services. Others who have done less, have been rewarded by His Majesty. No notice, no thanks, even, as I have ever heard, were bestowed on him. It would be a pity to see him lose his head, and the family their splendid fortune." "Tom/' said Mr. Ayres, "you know he married the widow of your father's cousin, and got the lion's share of the Custis property by her. It would be a shame for him to have that confiscated by turning rebel." "He may lose the money he got by the widow-some 40,000, I believe-but the fifteen thousand acres of land near Williamsburg, and the Arlington estate on this side of the bay, belong to his wife's children by her first husband, and could not be forfeited, I think, by any attainder on him." "A truce to the rebels; come, gentlemen!" said Mr. Edward Wise, a young politician, who had hitherto been a silent, medi-  tative listener; " before the moon rises, let us have another" throw, and then to horse." This was agreed to nem. con., and a few minutes afterwards lights were gleaming in the bar-room, and the dice were rattled X vigorously at the table, while many hearty bursts of laughter, and an occasional violent expression, resembling an imprecation, attested the fluctuations of the game. Mr. Hayley, seeing his high-spirited young guests thus enga- ged, withdrew in quest of the parson, resolving to ascertain, if possible, more precisely what it was that caused him to ap-  proach the inn in such unusual haste. The news he had referred  to, it struck the inquisitive and curious publican, did not seem to be a sufficient explanation. But Mr. Hewitt had finished his tea, and withdrawn by a side exit, in company with Mr. MacCoskie and Master Robert Wales; and the vigilant innkeeper was under the necessity of returning disappointed to his guests in the bar-room, where, contrary to the purpose of the gamesters, and almost imperceptibly, the 6   THE MONARCHST.          9 minutes flew past, and. the hour of midnight was at hand when they finally resolved to mount their impatient steeds. The two clergymen, having in charge the spiritual welfare of the two counties of Eastern Virginia, were gentlemen of -learn ing, not without fortune, and allied to some of the great families in Scotland and England. They were both arrived at the meri- dian of life, and capable of foreseeing that any change of govern- ment, which should weaken the power of the monarch, or disa- vow the authority of the Bishops, must result in injury to the Church. They believed, most religiously, that the principles of good government necessarily embraced one supreme head, inde- pendent in tenure and action of the caprices of the people; and that this head must be in alliance with, if not a part of, the established church. Such they deemed was the economy of heaven, and designed for imitation on earth. Hence it was, that the clergymen of the Church of England, and there were but few others at that day in the southern colonies, were among the first to take the alarm, when the bold spirit of determined opposition to the real or fancied encroachments of the Crown, began to develope itself. When the two ministers withdrew by a side door from the inn they were preceded by Master Robert Wales, who led the way with. a revolving tin lantern in his hand, and pointed out the few inequalities of the path in that almost uniformly level coun- try. Not choosing to traverse the highway which passed in front of the inn, the party of three crossed one or two small fields and then entered a dense grove of pines, in the midst of which stood a venerable cruciform dark brick church.* The two clergymen walked the whole distance without uttering a word. The few. hints dropped at the table by Mr. Hewitt, seemed to afford food for the most profound meditation, and hence the features of the reverend gentlemen assumed, in the eyes of Master Robert, a most mysterious cast of seriousness. The silence was maintained until they were seated in the little vestry room on the righti; of the pulpit. When Master Robert had locked the door, closed the shutters, and placed a lighted candle on the table, Mr. Hewitt's lips were unsealed. Master Robert, said he, fixing his piercing gray eyes upon the diminutive form of the clerk, and scrutinizing his features closely, ", Master Robert Wales, can we rely upon your being an unwavering and incorruptible royalist, under any and all circum- stances?" * It stands there yet. It is said to have been erected during the reign of Charles I., and that the materials ere imported from England.     10         THE MONARCHST. "I think so, sir! My father and grandfather lost their lives in the service of the Stuarts!" "Indeed!" exclaimed both the reverend gentlemen, neither of them having heard of such a thing before. "We must learn your history at some convenient time," continued Mr. Hewitt, regarding the apparent youth with interest. "But, from your age, one might suppose the violent death of your father would be a matter of such recent occurrence, that it could hardly be unknown to any. one acquainted with you." "Ha-ha-ha! Why, you see, sir," responded Master Robert, laughing, and speaking in an affected childish voice, " people do not always conjecture rightly. No one knows whence I came, or whither I shall go,-save, finally, I hope, to heaven,-nor my age, condition-" "No levity, Master Robert-not now," said Mr. MacCoskie, with a reproving shake of the head. "Your condition is some- times that of a teacher of the sons and daughters of the gentry, of the county, and clerk of St. George's parish. Your age is not material; but it cannot exceed twenty-eight-I should not suppose it so much, had I not known you these ifteen years, and perceived so little change in you."   2 "Little change! Why, sir," continued Masr Robert, assum- ing'a deep manly voice, "I am two pounds lighter than I was fifteen years ago. I was out in the 'forty-five,' sir!" "Tush, boy!" said Mr. Hewitt, "let us have no braggart falsehoods." "Sir, I utter no falsehoods. But I perceive you are deceived by appearances, like others, and I excuse the insinuation." This was uttered in a tone of melancholy indifference. "Upon my word, Master Robert, you seem to be in earnest, and to be touchedy my doubts. If it be true you were out in that rebellion, maya ask which side you were on?" "On the' side of the rightful Prince." "It is a question who was the rightful one!" remarked Mr. MacCoskie, whose family had espoused the side of the Pre- tender. "I understand him," continued Mr. Hewitt; "he means Charles Edward, who, indeed, still lives, and still aspires, I un- derstand. But, Master Robert, may one ask why it is that you are found at this day officiating in St. George's parish, and under the authority of King George, who is the defender of our faith, and the upholder of the established church?" "I act upon the diplomatic rule, sir; I acknowledge the go- vernment de facto."   THE MONARCHST.          1 B' But you would prefer the expelled one as de jure?" "It would ill become me to say, sir. Let it suffice that I would prefer either, to the-rule of the bullying rebel-leaders in the colonies." "That is well said, Master Robert!" replied Mr. Hewitt; "and we will not hesitate to have you as an auditor, and if need be, a participator in our conference." Master Robert Wales was a dwarf of perfect proportions. His height was but little more than four feet, and his weight did not exceed seventy-five pounds. His face but slightly wrinkled; his flaxen hair arranged in a profusion of ringlets so as generally to conceal the usual serious cast of his features, when silent; his erect form, suppleness and agility of limb; and above all, his flexibility of voice, oftentimes evincing extraordinary ventriloquial powers, enabled him on occasions of necessity or humour to de- ceive any one in regard to his age. But perhaps the most re- markable trait of his physical conformation, was the one which he uniformly exhibited in moments of angry passion. In such moments, his clear eagle eyes assumed an unparalleled expression of ferocity, which never failed to terrify and awe the beholder. This was accompanied by a dark purple hue which, shooting up from his nose, spread over both his eyes, and heightened the effect of his chilling gaze. The boldest of the young gentlemen in the county had been subdued by the ferocious glance of Mas- ter Robert, when excited to fury by some unjustifiable provoca- tion. Indications of- the rising of this:ungovernable passion had been perceptible when Mr. Hewitt insinuated a doubt of the truth of the statement that he had been out in the ' forty-five.' "I have letters," said Mr. Hewitt, placing a number on the table, of great importance. They convince me, Mr. MacCos- kie, that affairs have arrived at a crisis, and that loyal men and good Christians should lose no time in taking measures for the prevention of their own. destruction, and for the welfare of this unhappy country. Here is one from Lord Dunmore, urging us to do all in our power to prevent the rebels from having any en- couragement or co-operation on this shore. He desires us to re- port to him the names of those who are most friendly to the refractory Burgesses, and will be most likely to join the insur- gents in the acts of open violence they are now confessedly meditating. In Northampton, the Kendals, Cables, Wilkinses, Smiths, Eyries, Upshurs, Parsonses, Kers, Poulsons,Yerbys, Par- kers, Strattons, and Tazewells, are among the principal characters, who have the greatest influence with the people. None of them have yet consented to serve on any of the revolutionary com-     12        - THE MONARCHST. mittees, nor do they yet evince a disposition to proceed to extre- mities with their Sovereign. But some of them do not hesitate to condemn the acts of the ministers and parliament as wrong in principle." "Wrong in prtncple!" said Mr. MacCoskie, with petulance. " What would they have? The stamp act has been repealed; the articles taxed are few, and the burden light. Would they have his Majesty defend them against the inroads of the savages, and protect them against the rest of the world, at his own charge? Would they have the colonists exempted from participation in the expense? And they will not, it seems, submit even to a declaratory act, that they are like other subjects of his Majesty, and are to be bound by his government 1" "No; the characters I have named do not go quite that far; and I hope to be able to convince them that it is both the part of duty and wisdom to remain at least as neutral spectators of the struggle which I am informed, and which indeed I see, must inevitably ensue."  It is not only bound to ensue, but the dreadful consequences to the unhappy colonists who shall take part against their sovereign, are equally apparent. In Accomac county the leading characters maintain a similar attitude to those of Northampton. The Custises are undecided,4 may say indifferent, with one or two exceptions. They are not to be ,led away by the example of Col. Washington. They have heard that Washington has quartered the three legs* on his shield, and they seem to be rather amused at it than flattered. Besides, they think the branch of the family over the bay has had too heavy a share of the property. However, Thomas Custis, whom you met at the inn, and probably the younger brother Robinson, have such ad- venturous spirits within them, that if there is danger to be found anywhere on the continent, they may be inclined to seek it, just for the enjoyment of the thing. And some of the younger Wises, like the Douglases, from whom they descended,would plunge into a water-spout on the ocean, or rush upon a park of artillery, simply for the love of danger, if once roused to action. But I have not been informed that these young gallants have expressed an intention to take up arms on either side. Their ancestors have all been true loyalists. The Robinsons, Scar- boroughs, Wests, Yeardleys, Parkers, Joyneses, Bagwells, Satchells, Finnys, Baylys, Lukers, Croppers, Seymours, Fishers, Wapleses, and the other families of most consideration, have not taken any steps, or expressed any opinions indicative of a pur- * The Custis arms.   THE MONARCHST.          13 pose to join the party against the King in the evidentl ap- proaching rebellion." "But will they continue quiet when they hear that hostilities  have actually commenced?" "I hope so; I cannot undertake to answer for them positively. I think I may safely say, however, that more than half the men will refuse to take part against their King." "And all the women," remarked Master Robert. "True; and their influence is something." "Well!" continued Mr. Hewitt, " they will be speedily tried. Lord Dunmore says in his postscript that a battle has been fought in Massachusetts Bay; and that the King's troops have suffered in a retreat from Lexington."  "Retreat?" "A retrograde movement, I presume.' Bad!" said Master Robert. "Bad for the rebels, Master Robert, as I have no doubt you will live to see, since the many years you have already dwelt upon the earth have made so little impression on your physiog- nomy. Gen. Gage is to be reinforced, and twenty ships are to be ordered over. But his lordship informs me that he feels it to be his duty to adopt some precautionary measures, in view of counteracting the turbulent spirits about Williamsburg; and he has ordered some marines, from the Magdalen, at anchor in the river, to take on board some twenty barrels of gunpowder, and some arms, this very night." "Night! Was he afraid to do it in the day time?" asked Master Robert. "Not afraid; but circumspect, Master Robert," continued Mr. Hewitt. "It would not be politic to precipitate matters, until his Majesty's armies are landed. But the main point in his Lordship's letter to me, is to ascertain if a safe place of de- posit can be found on this side of the bay for the powder and arms, until they shall be required for use." "Was there no such place in Northampton?" asked Mr. Mac Coskie. "None that I knew of; besi s/I1ave no confidants there. Doubtless there are many ofmy parishioners devoted to the cause of the king, who would willingly serve his Lordship in this matter; but it would not be seemly for the minister to be active in affairs of this kind; that is hunting depositories for arms and, ammunition." "Will not the same objection apply to me, here?" asked Mr. MacCoskie, in some haste and warmth; and as he spoke, he; 2     "        THE MONARCHST. rose and threw open the shutters of one of the windows to ad- mit the air. "Undoubtedly," replied Mr. Hewitt; but it occurred to me that the thing might be managed by some confidential friend, if you had such an one, or by your clerk, without implicating you. Master Robert's diplomatic skill, I think, might serve us and the King defacto, in this emergency." "Master Robert is his gracious Majesty's most obedient Ser- vant," replied the dwarf, rising, and making a courtly bow. "And," continued Mr. Hewitt, "the utmost promptitude of action will be required. The powder and arms may arrive to- night. They may be sent over in a barge, or a common schooner. The Governor writes that it may be known by the exhibition of certain signals, which he describes, and that other signals are to be given from the land, to apprise the master that a place of de- posit hasfbeen found. Here is his letter, Master Robert." "I see what is to be done," said Master Robert; "I must mount to-night. The old Red Mill at the head of Deep Creek, is the place. But Squire West must be prepared for it. Ha!" he exclaimed, rising, his eyes assuming their startling ferocity, and the dark blood settling on his brow. "What stirs you so frightfully, Master Robert?" demanded Mr. Hewitt, seeing him gazing out of the window. A moment after horses were heard galloping away. "'Nothing of consequence. Merely those young gallants, Parker, Wise, and Custis, peeping in upon us. They could hear Vothing." "It was merely frolicsome curiosity," said iMr. MacCoskie; "their thoughts dwell less upon the affairs of state, than the affairs of gallantry. They would be more likely to invent a tale of our being closeted at this hour with fair nymphs, than being in council upon matters touching the King's authority." "I will know more of them to-night," said Master Robert, preparing to take his leave "Master Robert, hold!" cried Mr. Hewitt, rising, and placing his hand upon Wales's shoulder; "I have forgotten to mention that young Percy will accompany the arms and ammunition. The Governor has given him instructions to land, and to remain near the deposit, without seeming to exercise any control, until further advice. He is very young, and inexperienced. Let him have the benefit of your counsel. He is merely a sort of volun- teer aid to his Lordship; but being the brother of Lord Percy, now in Massachusetts Bay, who, it is said, was a participator in j    THE MONARCHST.          15 the bloody scene recently enacted there, some circumspection aay be necessary on his part." Master Robert Wales, filled with the. importance of his mis- sion, made an extremely deferential inclination of his head, ad- justed his beaver, and withdrew. No sooner was the door closed behind him, than he glided with almost superhuman swiftness through the grove of pines, and in a brief space of time was mounted upon his fleet black horse, following in rapid pursuit of the rollicking young gentlemen whom his keen eyes 'had detected in the act of peering through the window upon the midnight conclave assembled in the vestry-room. The country, as has been intimated, was almost perfectly level. It was intersected with many roads, leading to the numerous mansions situated near the waters of the many creeks which indented the shore at short intervals. Even at that day the county of Accomac was densely populated, and hdl every appearance of antiquity and general cultivation that may at this time be observed, in the flat counties of Delaware and Pennsvlvania. There were, however, as there are at this time, many dense and dark groves of pines between the planta- tions through which the roads ran in various-directions. Robert Wales was familiar with these, and knew exactly-when to aban- don the main county road, and which direction to pursue, so as to gain the point of destination in the most direct manner, and in the least space of time. After galloping his agile steed seve- ral miles through the narrow lanes, or under the luxuriant pines he rclsed up sddeuly at a short angle f the roads the ai Lty of the beautiful village of Onancock, and listened intently a brief moment to the voices which had attracted his ear, and which proceeded from the party of youngsters whom he was desirous of overtaking. It seemed that upon emerging from the grove, and entering the lane where the angle occurred, the party of young gentlemen had fallen into a gentle pace, and were ac- tually engaged in an animated discussion of the exciting question of the day. "Ned," said Custis, in an emphatic tone and with a corres- ponding jesture, ," Dick Revel told me this morning, that he had seen John Dix (who sailed his sloop from Norfolk on Sunday), and was informed by him that Patrick Henry had proposed, at Richmond, that the militia should be trained, and the people be armed; and that the convention had adopted the proposition. War is the word   As far back as last year, Henry said we must Jofn Wise said the ame thinglast Sunday at the door "John Wise said the same thing last Sunday, at the door     16         THE MONARCHST. of St. James's church, after MacCoskie had preached against the heinous sin of privy conspiracy and rebellion." "But who will we fight, here?" asked Parker. "If we stay here, we will not fight; I suppose that is very certain, unless it be in the old way, and among ourselves, at the court-house," replied Custis. "Will any of our men leave the county to fight? That's the question," said Parker. "Captain Cropper says he is ready to go, for one," remarked young Wise; "he received a letter the other day from Major Matthews, who is rampant for a battle. Tom Custis, your bro- ther Robinson was there, and after hqaring the-letter read, hinted pretty strongly that he would go too." "I'll wager my beaver, and my horse also, that Robinson never does any such thing. His sweetheart, Fanny West, has him now, sei-rely enough. She will play him along the shore, for her amusement; but she's not going to give him line enough to cross the bay. I know her too well, and her gouty aristocratic father also, to suppose they will let Robinson take up arms against the King. Besides, he's too young-not eighteen." "Fanny is older than that, I think," remarked Parker. C A few months." "But what says your lady, Tom?" "Who?" "Don't pretend to be ignorant, Tom!" continued young Par- ker. "You, know the one I mean. Everybody knows, or at least believes, and consequently they assert, that you have the hook in the mouth of Miss Sally Luker." "A mistake. What say you, Ned?"  This was addressed to young Wise, who had begun to hum a tune with an appearance of indifference. "Oh!" continued Parker; "I recollect it is Miss Betsey Miss Sally is for Ned." "The people are very kind!" said Wise; "they could not confer on me a greater prize, I am very sure, than to give me Miss Sally. But I fancy she will insist upon having the bestowalof her own hand. Yet, if Tom. and I are to be governed by the wishes of our sweethearts, and if you have named the right ones, I am thinking we will have to shoulder our guns and away to the wars." "They are both furious rebels, sure enough," said Tom, "if approbation of the conduct of Washington, and the letters of old Franklin, be any criterion." At this juncture, the young men, who had for some time been   THE MONARCHST.         17 leisurely riding abreast, were attracted by the quickened pace of Master Robert's horse, which, after creeping noiselessly along for some minutes, had been suddenly spurred forward. "Master Bob, by the light of this meridian moon!" exclaimed young Wise, who had halted and turned towards the approaching horseman. "Where are you cantering to?" asked young Custis. (,We left you quietly seated with the parsons, in the church." "Yes, I saw you looking through the window at us," was the laconic reply. "Why did you send that devilish dark scowl at us? The church is public property, and may be visited by day or by night, on foot or on horseback; and, methinks, heavenly smiles would become its parson and his clerk something better than the de- testable frowns of Satan." e"Master Thomas, there is a distinction between catering at the door and eves-dropping at the window." "Master Bob, you are not much larger than my thumb, and it would be shameful in me to knock a tom-tit down with my fist. But, if you repeat the words you have just uttered, I will lift you from your horse and give you a switching. I cannot see your frown by moonlight; and, besides, I am no longer your pupil." "Master Thomas Custis!" said Wales, in grave manly tones; "Iet us, if possible, not be enemies. I am older than I seem, and have received favours from your family. I would not have strife with any one of your name, or kin" "That includes you and me, Ned, and one-half the people in the two counties," said young Parker. "But," continued the dwarf, sitting proudly erect, "if it should unfortunately occur, be assured, I have not the slightest -doubt that I would prove quite equal to any single antagonist, with pistol, lance, or sword." A hearty burst of laughter succeeded this speech, which was immediately followed by the tender of Custis's hand, as a 'nark of reconciliation. "But, Master Robert," said he, "it seems to me there must be some important secret connected with your meeting at such an hour in the old church. Why did Mr. Hewitt dash up to the inn in such hot haste? Why did you frown, rather than smile at us through the window? Why are you now on your horse, instead of being in your little bed?" "The times, Master Thomas, the times are out of joint, and full of dangers. In several colonies men are in arms, to oppose 2*     18         THE MONARCHST. the King. In London, it is said, a turbulent man by the name of Wilkes, with a mob at his heels, insults the royal family, and stones the houses of the nobility. Surely it is the duty of the ministers of the church to lose no time in devising measures to restore peace, and to defend the throne, upon which the church so much depends. Your family have held high offices, and reaped large advantages under all the monarchs; and I think you will not be so ungrateful as to lift a hand against the pre- sent King, when he is, as I assure you, encompassed by troubles, and threatened with the deprivation of the fairest portion of his dominions." "But why preach thus to us, Master Bob?" demanded young Wise. "Is there any likelihood that there will be rebellion or war in the counties of Accomac and Northampton?" "No; there will be no war here. His "Lordship, Governor Dunmore, is informed that nearly all the inhabitants in these counties are well affected; and the King, himself, is well aware of it, from the reports of the lamented Lord Botetourt; and particularly from the letters of the good old Governor Fauquier, who declared that the best whist players in America, or Europe, were to be found on the eastern shore of Virginia. 'Gad,' he said, 'the Hon. John Custis, his own lieutenant-governor, and Squire Scarborough, played a whole week against him and Anson, and came very near ruining him.' Some of the dowagers of the court, upon hearing it, expressed a strong desire to come over, and test the truth of the statement. But, to return. A Mr. Matthews, a self-styled major, it is said, is secretly endeavouring to raise a battalion to fight against his King; and I know he has written to this county for a portion of his men--" "The little imp knows everything, Ned," said Master Harry Parker, in an under tone.  "And seeing what it must end in," continued the dwarf, "bullet wounds, or death upon the gallows, to say nothing of the forfeiture of estates, it is not to be wondered at, I am sure, if Mr. Hewitt should gallop away to Mr. MacCoskie, to confer about the most effectual mode of averting these impending evils from the heads of their parishioners. Nor is it so wonderful that they should send me forth, even at midnight, to warn the people." "But who are you going to warn to-night?" asked Ned. "You-you three. I have warned you, and do warn you!" This was uttered in such deep and solemn tones, that the young men thought fit to make no reply to it. "Farewell, young gen tlemen," continued Master Robert, dismounting in front of the   THE MONARCHST.          19 Red Mill, at which place they had arrived. "I may see you to- morrow at Squire West's or Squire Luker's, and may have some stirring news for you concerning the rebels across the bay." The young gentlemen uttered a hasty adieu, and galloped down the road leading round the creek towards the house of the widow Custis, now some two miles distant, and where the three intended to rest the remainder of the night, and to continue their slumber as usual, perhaps, till ten o'clock the next day. A recent shower had replenished the pond, and, late as it was, the machinery of the mill was in motion. Hence it was, that old George, the negro miller, albeit white enough in his exterior, soon emerged from the door and approached Master Robert. "Is dat you, Mars' John? What upon de top of de arth is you doing out at dis time ob de night?" "It is Master Robert, George," replied the dwarf. "Lor a mercy, so it is!" exclaimed old George, retreating a step backward, for he, in common with all the negroes of the county, associated some mysterious signification with the diminu- tive form of the parish clerk. "Lor bless you, Mars' Robert, I hope you isn't 'fended, 'cause I took you for little Mars' John Custis. Your horse is edzactly like one ob de widow's." "No, no. But, George, it is too late to rouse the Squire to- ll  night; and therefore I will thank you to put my horse in a pen, and throw him a dozen ears of corn;" "I will, most sartinly, Mars' Robert. But, Mars' Robert," he continued, in hesitation, "I hab nothing to give your worship to eat but some roasted oysters." "The fat of the land, or rather the cream of the bay, Uncle George. I could desire nothing better, and nothing else." "But, Mars' Robert, dere's no bed in de mill for you to sleep im  on." I   "No matter, Uncle George; a sack of grain will do; this warm night I will require no covering, and I am not so large but I shall find plenty of room." After some further hesitation, and one or two ineffectual at- tempts to stammer out other impediments, the submissive slave proceeded to feed the horse, and afterwards to prepare the oysters for its master. I '     20         THE MONARCHST. CHAPTER II. Tle signal heard, haste to the beach, Where loyal hands and hearts may meet, And ladies fair with friendly speech The stranger-youth shall smiling greet. Alas! how soon a smile may fade! And clouds o'ercast the earth with shade! But famous deeds in every clime Survive the wrecks of death and time. AT the dawn of day Master Robert Wales was mounted on his fleet charger, both seemingly as fresh and vigorous as if they had rested the entire night in the comfortable beds to which they had been accustomed. Instead, however, of bespeaking a morning's repast at the hospitable board of Squire West, the diminutive rider set out in the direction of the bay, and rode along the coast, surveying the expanse of waters from the mouth of the Onancock up to Deep Creek. At the entrance of the latter, he was gratified on beholding the red streamer, the signal he was in quest of, flying at the mast-head of a shallop. The small ves- sel lay at anchor, seemingly awaiting some communication from the shore. After riding out on the firm sandy beach to the edge of the water, which was at low ebb, Master Robert drew up, and taking a brace of pistols from a belt which had been concealed by his long waistcoat, fired them in the air, at intervals of about a minute apart. An instant after the last pistol was discharged, the streamer disappeared from the mast-head of the shallop, and soon a yawl approached the land. In the stern sat a youth, neatly dressed, who pointed the boat towards the spot where Master Robert stood. When the prow touched the beach, Mas- ter Harry Percy, for he it was who had been sitting in the stern,. sprang out, and'after directing the men at the oars to remain where they were, without hesitation approached the one who had answered his signal according! to the instructions of Lord Dun- more. But when standing face to face with Master Robert, who had dismounted and greeted him with deference, he seemed to be rooted to the earth, and stared in astonishment at the pigmean specimen of humanity before him. "Pardon my stature, Master Henry Percy," said Master Robert, smiling, for he had been gazed at too often to be offend- ed at a new exhibition of amazement on beholding his diminu-   THE MONARCHST.          21 tive face and proportions; " it was not my fault. I am as na- ture made me; and I have cause to be thankful that such as I amn the ability has been given me to be of some service to his Majesty. I am Robert Wales, at your service, sent hither by Mr. Hewitt of Hungers' parish, Northampton county, on busi- pess of his Excellency, Lord Dunmore, the king's governor of this Ancient Dominion, first quartered as such on the arms of his Majesty Charles II., two years before the Restoration, and retained ever afterwards." "Master Robert Wales," said Percy, "I embrace you as an accredited friend. And if I was startled at beholding you, it was not, upon the word ofa gentleman, from any disagreeable sensa- tion produced by your extremely delicate dimensions; but from the difficulty I found in avoiding an identification of your fea- tures with those of one of similar stature, of whom I had heard my father often-speak." "It was not strange, Master Harry; since, however much the lapse of time may seem to deny it, I am the identical individual. Your brother, Lord Percy, would doubtless have remembered me, as I had the honour frequently of attending him in the park, when he was a mere boy. But I will not longer divert your thoughts from matters of higher importance." "Master Robert, believe me, the most pressing demand I feel at this moment, is in my stomach. We were blown about last night in one of your little gusts, as they ire called; and I assure you I suffered more from sea-sickness during the half-hour it lasted, than I have done in crossing the broad ocean. That ill- ness, as is usual, has been succeeded by the gnawing pangs of a most ferocious appetite; and if you cannot serve me, I know not how they may be allayed, for we have nothing whatever that may be eaten in the shallop." Before Master Robert had considered his answer to this de- mand, he beheld, with marks of pleasure, a small party galloping over the beach and approaching the place where he-stood. This party consisted of the Misses West, sisters, and Miss Ann Custis, accompanied by Robinson Custis and Samuel Waples, young gentlemen supposed to be affianced to two of the three damsels they were attending. Manifesting the fine spirits incident to youth and health, and which were heightened by the exhilara- tion of the beautiful morning, they came with ringing laughter and joyous tones, free and unchecked, until they perceived they were in the presence of a tall handsome youth, an entire stran- ger, whose pale smooth brow, and costly attire, added to his graceful salutations, bespoke him of gentle condition. The a     22         THE MONARCHST. young ladies instantly ceased their volubility, and even their hi- larious gallants became more reserved. "This young gentleman," said Master Robert, who advanced a few steps to where the party had halted, greeting them in his usual bonhommie manner, "complains of being extremely hun- gry. They have nothing to eat on the shallop which brought him over, and he has landed in quest of a breakfast." "Invite him to go home with us," said Miss Ann West to young Waples. "Father will be pleased if you do-" "And angry if you do not," said Ann Custis. "Who is he?" asked Waples. "Young Harry Percy; a sort of volunteer aid to his Excel- lency." "What is he doing here? Perhaps Dunmore has sent over the shallop for a cargo of negroes, or to seize some of us rebels!" This was spoken, half seriously, by Waples. "I believe you will turn rebel, Sam," said Master Robinson Custis. "But as for this young blood, I think the two Anns and Fanny can easily make a prisoner of him, without the dark looks or bright swords of us nen." The dwarf performed the ceremony of introducing the youth, who soon became as free and ay as any of the party, notwith- standing his prolonged fasting. He readily accepted the horse of Master Robert (who proposed running up the creek in the yawl with the tide, which was now setting in)%nd soon display- ed his horsemanship as he cantered along at the side of the ladies, while Waples lagged a few rods behind, with rather a grave expression on his lips,. A fine breeze sprung up with the rising ofihe sun. Master Robert, being a good sailor, as well as skilful at almost every- thing else, soon had a small sheet, which .had been brought off from the shallop,.swelling before the wind, and the little craft darted with great swiftness along the sinuosities of the creek. When passing the mansion of the widow Custis, which was in full view, and not far distant from the creek, that became quite narrow as they ascended, he directed a slave, who had been get- ting up oysters, to present his compliments to his master Thomas when he arose for breakfast. The wind, the tide, and the vigorous strokes of the hearty tars, sent the boat bounding on; and long before the equestrians had entered the eastern gate of Squire West's plantation, Master Robert was traversing the grassy lawn on the opposite side of the house, and smiling at the double row of staring young ne- groes through which he passed.   THE MONARCHST.          23 The mansion was quite unimposing in dimensions and shape. It was a long, rambling frame structure, built at different periods, as its succession of occupants had seen proper to erect additional rooms, without symmetry, and with no view to architectural beauty. It was a sharp-roofed one-story building, just affording space above for several sleeping apartments, while as many chambers below were allotted for the same purpose. It was in the midst of a square lawn of moderate dimensions, around which towered great Lombardy poplars, and which could be seen in that level country from a considerable -distance, while they entirely obscured the house from view. In the rear, some fifty paces distant, ran the shallow waters of what was then and still is called, Deep Creek. It was here not exceeding fifty feet in width at flood-tide, and only just deep enough to float a heavily laden scow. Above, some six or eight hundred yards, at the source of the creek, was situated the Red Mill. At the door of the old mansion stood the portly Squire, sup- porting himself with a strong cane, for he was periodically afflicted with severe attacks of the gout in his feet, and sometimes in his hands. And although he had been recently suffering, as he de- claredtLe tortures of the condemned in the nether regions, yet a broad smile brightened his features as he beheld Master-Robert appro ah with the lightness and celerity of a youth. "Master Bob, you are welcome hither; come in, man, or boy, whichever you may be. Some think you are the devil, himself. Nevertheless, I bid you welcome. If you take none of us away until you go hence yourself, some of us will have a long enough respite; especially those doomed to be tormented on earth by the infernal gout." The Squire had by this time become seated within, and had lifted his right foot upon an opposite chair, with a twist of the features which indicated that he felt or feared a return of one of the pangs he had been referring to. "Sit down, there.' Now, Master Bob, what is the news of the day? What is to be the end of this eternal tempest in all the American tea-pots? Hark! the young people are coming. Never mind your answer, now. We can, perhaps, discuss the matter at breakfast, which is Waiting." Wales, however, seized an opportunity of making knowt to the Squire the particulars of the meeting on the beach, and the fact that young Percy would be with them at the table with a most voracious appetite. "It was well done, Master Bob. We must strive to make Master Harry comfortable; on account of his family, and as a     24    1     THE MONARCHST. mark of respect to his Lordship at Williamsburg; but above all, because he is a stranger." When the company assembled round the hospitable board, it might have been observed-and it was remarked by Waples-- that the young ladies had bestowed some extra attentions upon their dress and hair, and in addition seemed to be somewhat more punctilious than on ordinary occasions. They were tall, hand- some young damsels; and the exercise and fresh air of the morning had imparted a slight flush to their cheeks over and above the accustomed beautiful colour ever mantling there. All were fair; the eldest of the Misses West having black hair, and sparkling eyes of the same hue; while her sister Fanny dis- played a luxuriance of glossy hair between a brown and a black, with eyes of the same medium between a black and a blue. The eyelashes of both were of unusual length; and their features were of the same mould, partaking of an equal mixture of the Saxon and Grecian. Both were gentle in their natures, confiding, and obedient to parental authority. But Miss Ann Custis, their guest and cousin, resembling them -in form and features, was supposed to be the most spirited girl in the county, and the most capable of resenting any affront; as young Waples, in particular, who was subject to unreasonable fits of jealousy, could have attested. They were dressed in the fashionable costume of the. time, which was well adapted to display to the best advantage, and without deception, their admirable forms.   I  Although so remarkably similar in features and dispositimons, there was a slight difference in the temperaments of the two sisters, which could be easily remarked by those accustomed to be much in their society. Fanny was the most yielding, and in moments of real or supposed danger, would venture the least, in the way of provocation, or sacrifice the most to produce recon- ciliation and harmony. Percy could not altogether restrain his unaffected eagerness to satisfy the cravings of hunger, although he was too well-bred not to attempt it. He was indulged as much as possible by the sympathizing Squire, who had placed him between his daughter Ann, who performed the honours of the table, and himself. "No ceremony, Master Harry," said he, while setting the ex- ample; "be supplied, or supply yourself, with whatever the table may furnish agreeable to your palate. No false modesty is tolerated at my board-as my daughters and their cousin can bear witness-when one's appetite craves a full and speedy satis- faction." "Who do you mean, father? Do you allude to us?" asked AD@.   THE MONARCHST.          25 d To be sure I do. I have seen, often-and have rejoiced to see it--unquestioned, and most unquestionable evidences of vora- city in you all, particularly after a morning's gallop on the beach." "I trust, father, we are not so very, very greedy," replied Fanny. "Not always," he admitted, smiling, and casting glances at their plates, the contents of which were not at the moment being consumed with the boldness of an unrestrained appetite. By the time the repast was finished, and during which nothing further worthy of notice was said (for all of them had greater predilections for eating than talking), and they were assembled in a more formal manner in the Squire's sitting-room, the hounds announced the approach of the young gentlemen from whom Master Robert had parted the preceding night, and who had been induced to rise at an earlier hour than usual in consequence of the slight message which Wales had sent them by one of the widow Custis's slaves. The loss of sleep had not checked their exuberance of spirits; and within five minutes from their intro- duction to young Percy, one might have supposed they had been familiar with him all their lives. And this abandonment of ceremony was promoted by the Squire with all his powers of vi- vacity and humour. He was exceedingly fond of the company of young men of sprightly dispositions; and as he was at times somewhat eccentric in his actions when transported by tran- sient fits of passion, many of his extravagant words and deeds formed the bases of a number of anecdotes and stories, at which, when related in his presence, he could laugh as heartily as any other person. On this morning, however, the Squire did not seem to encou-- rage any excessive hilarity. Recent mails had brought him ad- vices from the different colonies, and from abroad, which weiglied somewhat oppressively upon his mind. "Master Harry," said he, addressing Percy, " perhaps you can inform us precisely what the restless people intend to do on the' other side of the bay; or at least you can repeat, it may be,. what his Lordship thinks of the condition and tendency of things." "His Lordship, I believe, sir, thinks that the country is inre- bellion, and that the tendency is to bloodshed," replied P6rcy, seriously. "That is bad; very bad. But do you not think his Lordship has been hasty in his censures of the Burgesses, and ill-advised in dissolving them so often and so abruptly?" 3     26         THE MONARCHST. "I am unable to say what I should think in regard to those matters; in truth I have not thought much on the subject, be- cause I take it for granted that his Lordship has acted according to his instructions, and that there was hardly any other alterna- tive left him. His Majesty, I am informed, as well as his minis- ters, regard the requisitions and demands of the leading object- ors to their policy, as involving the question of supremacy. To grant what is demanded by Mr. Henry, Mr. Jefferson, and other leading promoters of the opposition to the government, would be to relinquish the right of control over the colonies, which can never be done without revolution and war." "I have heard," said Waples, "that the Burgesses, and the people about Williamsburg, are pleased with the Governor well enough, and might arrange everything with him to their mutual satisfaction, if he was not controlled too much by Lady Dunmore, and his favourite, Captain Foy, whose influence with Lady D. is said to be too great." "It is not a contest with the Governor," said Parker, "nor altogether about the actual grievances we suffer." "No!" said Wise. "The question is oie of principle. On one side it is contended that the right exists to tax the colonies, without their consent, for purposes of revenue; on. the other it is flatly denied." "And which side do you espouse?" asked Mr. Thomas Custis. * "When I understand the. merits of both sides more fully, I will pronounce my judgment." "Spoken like a politician!" said the Squire. "And in respectful deference to my seniors," replied Edward.  "You, sir, should be the first to instruct us boys, and to give us the benefit of your example." "That, too, is a sensible speech, Squire," remarked Master Robert. "Then let us await further developments, young gentlemen, before we irrevocably decide. We are like jurymen, called upon to pronounce in an important matter-a matter of property, and what is more, of life and death, perhaps; and it becomes us to be very circumspect and careful in arriving at a just conclusion. If we decide precipitately, and find we have gone wrong, there may be no opportunity of retracing our steps. We have too much at stake, and there are too many dependent upon us, to embark hastily in a cause which may prove to be both wrong in principle, and fatal in its consequences? "That is a lesson in wisdom, which we will do well to remem- ber," said Master Robert.   THE MONARCHST.          27 "But you are of an age to decide for yourself, Master Bob," replied young Custis. "And, brother," said Robinson Custis, "does not his opinion accord with the Squire's?" "And does not yours agree with Miss Fanny's?" retorted Thomas. This produced a pleasant sensation and a general snmile. The young lady, with colour somewhat heightened, but with an ill-concealed smile, replied, "And if it does, it is nothing; for I have formed no opinion at all. Perhaps there may be other young ladies in the neigh. bourhood, who have decided which party is in the right. I have heard there was one." "Yes, Tom, I am told she is a decided r lrebel," marked Par- ker. "I hope her sister Sally has not yet decided," he con. tinued, glancing at Master Wise. "Not yet decided?" responded Edward, who had momentarily been discussing some indifferent subject with Percy, and did not at first comprehend the meaning of the question. "He means whether to be a loyalist or a rebel," said Master Percy, who listened to everything that was said. "You are alluding to the Lukers," remarked the Squire. "But the men must not be governed by the opinions of the women. I set that example when my poor wife was living. The Misses Luker are attached to the Croppers, and I should not wonder if they unhesitatingly espoused the side that Washington is on." "Were it not for Washington," remarked Percy, " it is the belief of Lord Bute, and of his Majesty himself, as I learn from my brother at Boston, (who married Lord Bute's daughter), that the rebellion would be extinguished immediately. But he has taken the irrevocable step of accepting the post of Commander- in-chief of the rebel forces. He will not hope to be spared in the event of any reconciliation, and hence his great weight and influence will be exerted to prevent an accommodation., When Governor Dinwiddie returned to England, he found the King dis- posed to bestow special marks of royal favour upon Washington, in consideration of his services in the west, and upon the favour- able representations of Governor Fauquier. But Dinwiddie devised means to prevent his advancement, and was incited thereto by a remembrance of some disagreement with the Virginia colonel, whereby the Governor had been defeated in his purpose of appropriating to his own benefit some of the funds or property belonging to the public. If Washington had been knighted, and placed in high position in the British army, it is thought he would never have espoused the side against his sovereign."     S2     ' THE MONARCHST. "' He had reason, most certainly, to feel hurt at the npglect of ministers, after what he had done in the service of his Majesty," said the Squire. "But he was consoled by the rich widow, and by the inheritance of the Mount Vernon estate upon the death of his brother." "And then he was flattered and caressed by his own country- men, who stimulated any feelings of animosity he might enter- tain for the mother country, on account of the indifference of the court," said the insidious Master Robert Wales. "Perhaps now, you suppose," remarked Master Thomas Custis, "he aims at making himself King, or at least another Lord Protector?" "I presume he aims at winning some sort of distinction. But, Master Thomas, the kings of England have never been so neglectful of the merits of the Custises, that you should have cause to reproach them. The first of yourname in England won distinction for marching a thousand men fifty miles in one night to the aid of William the Conqueror. The King asked him if he did not have three legs. From that day the Custises have had three legs in their arms, and an eagle with wings spread out, and a star on its breast, to signify fleetness, and the famous march in the night, In every reign since then, some of the members of your family have been in the enjoyment of posts of honour and profit." "Pray, Master Bob, as you know everything, can you not tell me something of the history of my family?" asked Wise. "One Wise was hung--" "Sir!" exclaimed Edward, rising in anger, and pale with sudden emotion. "Be patient, Master Ned. It was no stain upon his escutcheon, if the notions of Henry, Lee, and Jefferson have any weight," continued the wily Wales. "It was about a hundred years ago, when Lord Culpeper was governor. In the counties of Glou- cester, Middlesex, and New Kent, the crop of tobacco was so very abundant, that the government, by what was really an arbitrary act, reduced the value of it; and as in most of the con- tracts between individuals, the article was a legal tender, and the standard value fixed at a certain rate, great injury to private interests was likely to ensue. The whole affair being primarily the work of the speculators and monopolists, the leading planters resolved to destroy a portion of their tobacco, as a remedy against the meditated high-handed oppression. This was resisted by force; and riots and bloodshed ensued. The crops were cur- tailed, but the troops of the governor succeeded in capturing   I T -    THE MONARCI ST. -29 some of the leaders of the rebellion, and among! them John Wise (who, perhaps, was no relative of your family), Richard Bayly, Henry Isman, John Hayley, John Sackler, and Thomas Ames, who were all executed. But their peighbours, and their posterity, who knew the circumstances, regarded them rather as martyrs and patriots than as traitors. They certainly had more justice on their side than our modern heroes. But the arms of the Wise family, derived from the Douglas or Selkirk source, have on the dexter, an athletic man with a huge club; on the sinister, an antelope. The crest is a salamander in flames. The motto, I Jamais arriere'-Never behind." ,t  "What are our arms?' demanded Parker, partaking of the interest excited by the ingenious dwarf. "s- Quite ancient and honourable," replied Wales. "A buck's head; crest, a dexter arm, holding a piece of coral. Indicating that your ancestors were fond of the royal sport of hbnting, and familiar with the sea. The Parkers are in the peerage, and have always been rich and noble." "You will make us all aristocrats, Master Bob," said the Squire, smiling. "Your families have been so from time immemorial. Why, Squire, no one can be ignorant that you are a lineal descendant of Thomas West, Lord Delaware, the first governor of Virginia, 4 '-who lived and died here; and that your daughters are the de- scendants, on the mother's side, of Sir George Yeardley, who came over in 1619." "It is a fact well known in England," remarked Percy, " that the heirs presumptive, and collateral branches of the most noble and powerful families, are dwelling in Virginia, Maryland, and the Carolinas." "We have the Scarboroughs," continued Wales, " whose sur- name is Lumly, a most important family in the chronicles of the court. The arms consist of three popinjays, supported by two parrots, and the crest a pelican." "Feathery and fishy," remarked Mr. Samuel Waples, ." I suppose, Master Bob, you know nothing glorious of my family." "I regret to say that I do not." "Then, I suppose I must be the founder of a noble family, ,and win glory in the war of Independence." "Independence!" repeated Percy, in surprise. "That is what Jefferson says will be the termination of the struggle." "Jefferson!" continued Wales. "Why, he acknowledges he never heard anything of his grandfather! No, sir; honours are 3*     30    K     HE MONARCHST. not bestowed, much less perpetuated, in a republic, which spe- cies of government it is understood Mr. Jefferson advocates. And it has been a practice since the era of civilization, forlthose indi- viduals who could have no pretensions to consideration from the merits of their ancestors, to rail against the distinctions claimed by men who are the descendants of virtuous and noble progeni- tors. When you hear a man ridiculing the idea of attaching im- portance to the noble blood which flows in the veins of others, you may be sure there flows none in his own.  If honours should not be perpetuated in one's family, why does Mr. Jefferson strive to win distinction? Why should he and Mr. Henry be so restless, and painfully laborious in their pursuit of fame? The glory of their families is in the prospective-they have no retro- spection. They know it must be a grievous strife to the end, even if they are successful. Say what they may, the fame they work for is designed for the participation of those to come after them, just as a parent accumulates gold for his children, rather than for his own exclusive enjoyment." "Mr. Jefferson will have the greatest number on his side, and may prove successful," said Waples, half abstractedly. "And if he does, and should succeed, just so sure as he leaves posterity, his descendants will boast of his great achievements, and exact a certain sort of homage as due to their family." "Master Robert," said Miss Fanny, " you have spoken of the great personages from whom we descended, but have said nothing of our arms. Pray can you describe them?" ' Certainly, Miss Frances Yeardley West; a rampant lion on the left, a cockatrice o the right; crest, a ducal coronet, sur- mounted by a griffin's h[ad, and motto, Jour de ma vie-day of my life."  "And what does that mean?" asked Ann. "Oh, it is an old French oath-day of my life!-by. my life!" "And that may account for the oaths the Squire utters so furi- ously sometimes," said Waples. "You are a perfect herald," said Percy, turning to Master Robert. "Heraldry has sometimes been my study, but merely for my amusement," replied Wales. "The Percy arms, one can never forget, who has once seen them. Lions all over, even to the crest. Nor can one ever forget the beautiful and glorious mot- to-Ep6rrance en Dieu-Hope in God. And, gentlemen, the an- cestors of all of you have ever been found on the side of the crown-most of them, it is true, at times rather on the side of   THE MONARnCHST.         31 the rightful owner of the diadem, than of the crown- itself. I allude to the royal Stuats, in the 'fifteen' or the ('orty five. " "And was not that rebellion?" asked Wise. -  i "It was so called, and so determined. But you Douglases have always been impetuous and turbulent, since, and even be- fore the reign of Henry IV. But yet they were never known to be in favour of annihilating the monarchy. They were too prince- ly in their blood, and glorious in their actions, to desire td behold all laudable distinctions obliterated by a mob of democrats." Thus it was that Master Robert strove to fortify the royal cause, by seekingto inflame a pride of birth in the minds of his auditors. And he desired to prepare the way to lay before the Squire the project he had conceived of making his Red Mill a j  royal magazine. He had viewed the premises the preceding night, and found a room which he thought would answer the pur- pose. He had conferred with Percy on the subject, whose views accorded with his own. Percy then sent back the sailors to the vessel for his baggage, and accepted an invitation to remain as a guest at the house of the Squire for an indefinite period. A dark cloud had been lowering in the west for several hours; and shortly after the termination of Master Robert's remarks, with which he had been entertaining the company, it had risen to the zenith, unobserved by any one in the house, and then startled them by a glaring flash of lightning, which was instantly followed by a tremendous explosion of thunder. "That struck somewhere near us," said the Squire, rising and limping to the door next the creek. "I thought so!" he con- tinued in a loud fierce voice, which drew around him the young people. "It is the third time this season that the lightning has struck that corner." "Corner of what, sir?" asked Percy. "The corner of the mill up there. Don't you see the smoke? There is old George and a troop of negroes putting the fire out. That old George is a true soldier! But the old Thunderer seems to have a spite against my mill! Why don't he try his hand against yonder gum? It is higher than the mill, and would be a mark better worth his while." "Father! forbear!" exclaimed his daughters, seeing both Percy and Wales much agitated and very pale. "Do not tempt the Great Being-who is no heathen god-to strike nearer to our home!" f Every time he strikes my mill, he strikes my home, at least my bread!" replied the Squire, in something like an angry tone. "Why don't he strike the old gum, I say?" he conti- , Z     32         THE MONARCHST. nued, in warmth. "Because, if he did, he would meet with his match " Just as these words were uttered a bolt more deafening than the first, fell upon the tree, at which all were looking, and shi- vered it into a thousand pieces! The Squire uttered not a word for many moments. Pale, and trembling, he turned and threw himself in his great chair. At length, after calling for wine, which .he drank with the eagerness of one who had been suffering from the effects of an intolerable thirst, he said, smiling, but not wholly recovered from his exces- sive agitation, "I yield, girls. About the existence of God, I never doubted, of course. None of us doubt that; and we have all been baptized, and are members of his church. But now, I am not only satisfied of his existence, but of his presence every- where, and that he is always near enough at hand to overhear our mocking words." After uttering this speech, he again re- lapsed into a musing silence. "This is not the only instance of the Squire's being rebuked by the powers above," said Waples. "It is not?" asked young Percy, still pale, for his family, for many generations, had attached important significations to phe- nomena in nature, which seemed to precede the fatal events which had happened to the race. "' Shall I tell it, Squire?" "Oh, yes; but don't embellish it too strongly;" he replied, smiling, and rapidly recovering from the unusual trepidation into which he had been thrown, and half ashamed of the exhibition he had made of what might be considered by some as a cowardly weakness. "It was not, so grave an affair as this," premised Waples. "The Squire, Robinson Custis, and I, got into the boat last week, and directed a couple of negroes to row us down to the fishing ground, about two miles distant. We had proposed taking some bay-salmon and rockfish. When about half way down a cloud came up suddenly and wet us. The Squire had the boat put about, declaring, as he had started in sunshine, he would not fish in wet clothes. It was done. With a dry suit on, we set out again. But just when we reached the same place where we en- countered the shower, another cloud came up, and drenched us again. Resolved not to be defeated in his purpose, the Squire had us rowed back once more. Just so sure as you saw the lightning strike that gum over the creek, a third cloud meius at the identical place where the others had wetted us." "Is it possible!" exclaimed Percy.   TIIE MONARCHST.         33 I  "It is true," said young Custis. "But," continued Waples, "the Squire swore it should not have the satisfaction of wetting him." "How could he avoid it?" asked Percy. "He jumped overboard; and you would have laughed to see our struggles, and those of the two negro men, in pulling him back again, and all the time he was smiling in triumph at having outwitted the cloud. But the best of the joke is to come. By the time we had him seated in the boat, the cloud had passed away, without letting fall a drop of rain, and the remainder of the day was bright aid bdautiful." The day wore away pleasantly enough.   Anecdotes, wine, cards and dice, seemed to have banished the painful incident of   the morning front the minds of all. But about sunset, the com- pany were startled by the galloping of horsemen across the country in various directions, and yet more so, by the arrival of Mr. John Drummond at the mansion. He came pale and breath- less, under whip and spur. He was known to be bitter in his denunciations of King George, and of all the Hanoverian line, and hence it was inferred he brought news of events calculated to stir up the people to a resistance of the royal authority. Drummond was connected by blood with the Lord John, who had espoused the cause of Charles Edward, and had suffered in behalf of the Stuarts.  Drummondtown, the county seat of Accomac, had been named after the family. "Sit thee down beside me, Drummond," said the Squire, "and tell us what all this scampering about the country means." '   It means that blood has been shed, and that the whole western shore is roused to the hightest pitch of fury. I came over in Captain Gibbs's vessel. We left Norfolk after breakfast to-day. It blew a hurricane behind us." "But the news on land, Mr. Drummond-what has occurred?' demanded Master Robert Wales. "The Governor," continued Drummond, " has seized in the night, and sent off most of the powder and arms in the maga- zine. They belonged to the colony, and not to King George. Colonel Nelson, President of the council, protested against it; Captain Montague, of the ship of war Fowey, at Yorktown, threatened to fire on Nelson, if he attempted to search his ship. Patrick Henry is heading the militia. Lord Dunmore, frightened at the aspect, has deposited with Mr. Robinson 350 to pay for the powder, &c. But it seems three young patriots of Wil- liamsburg, resolved to secure the rest of the arms and am- munition. They entered the magazine, and were all shot by     34         THE MONARCHST. spring-guns! Then the people swarmed like hornets around the Governor. But he fled, with Lady Dunmore and their bedizened pet, Captain Foy, to the Fowey. The Governor now calls us all rebels, and swears he will turn the negroes against us, burn our houses, and either shoot us in the field or hang us up by the neck. He is sending in all directions for the King's troops, and will soon have an army and fleet under his command." During this recital great excitement prevailed among the young gentlemen present, and some remarks were uttered in a low tone by Waples to the eldest of the Custises. These two young gentlemen had, from the first, conceived no favourable opinion of the young Percy, and now they seemed to regard him as one likely to become, in the progress of events, an open ene- my, whom they might encounter in the field of battle. Already they had received intimatioqs, indefinite it is true, that his bro- ' ther had ordered the King's troops to fire upon the men of Mas- sachusetts Bay; and that blood had flowed in consequence. "What do you whisper about, yojqg gentlemen?" asked the Squire. "We were merely sounding each other's thoughts, sir," re- plied the elder Custis; "and finding them to agree, we cannot hesitate to express them. We are on the side of our country, right or wrong-but we believe it is right. We will take up arms to defend our homes, at all events; and we must regard Lord Dunmore, and the Percys, who are the agents and attaches of the Tyrant, as    e enemies." "Of course the allusion is made to me," said Percy, struggling to repress his emotion; "and if these unhappy differences be- tween the people and their King, shall proceed to an extremity requiring each one of us to take the field, I have no hesitation in saying here, alone, or elsewhere, among thousands in arms, that I will be found on the side of his Majesty." Both Custis and Waples grew pale, and would have uttered some fierce reply, had they not been checked by the Squire, who, in tones of decision, remarked that Master Percy was his guest; and whether he could sanction the opinions he entertained, or approve his determination, in the event of actual war being waged, made no sort of difference. His person was not only sacred while he continued to be his guest, but he was at liberty to utter his opinions with perfect freedom, and must not be sub- jected to any species of insult. This speech was instantly applauded by the young men, and by none more than the two who had caused it. They acknow- ledged, upon reflection, that the rules of hospitality forbade any   THE- MONARCHST.         35 demonstrations of hostility under the circumstances in which Master Harry was placed, and they at once tendered him their hands, in token of the sincerity of their declarations. This con- duct was rewarded by the approving smiles of the young ladies; but such undisguised interest in the richly dressed and hand- some youth, on the part of Miss Custis, was by no means the sort of satisfaction which Waples might have desired. He was deeply in love with Ann, the sister of the young Custises, and could not bear, with internal composure, to see her evince anything resem- bling an active interest in another of his gender. But nothing more than anxious looks escaped him. This little scene had been followed by a brief conference aside between Percy and Wales. The latter, although not approving the newly conceived purpose of the former, was not induced to interpose any positive objection to his intention, as he had no special authority in the matter, and was merely to act under his instructions. "Gentlemen," said Percy, turning to the company, "I cannot doubt that the contents of the magazine at Williamsburg be- longed to the colony, since his excellency, the Governor, has seen proper to deposit a sum of money to pay for them. I did not know this before. Even in war, I cannot recognise any rule of conduct not based upon the principles of justice and honour; nor can any cause succeed on any other basis; therefore I have to announce that a portion of the ammunition and arms taken from the magazine, are on board the Loon, now lying some few miles distant down the creek. I was sent over to seek a place of deposit for them, and to remain n their vicinity. But, as they were not taken in open conflict, nd cannot be regarded as the property of the Governor, considering the mode in which they were obtained, and of which I was ignorant, I shall take the responsibility of holding them subject to the order of the civil authority of the colony, when such authority is established or more clearly defined." Nobly spoken!" said the Squire. "I do not like conceal- ments and mystery. No doubt, Master Bob, from what my miller told me this morning, it was your intention to hide this cargo in my mill, without, perhaps, letting me know anything about it, provided you supposed I would object to such a proceeding." "If such a purpose had been conceived," said Percy, "I have no doubt it was abandoned when he witnessed the direction of the lightning to-day." "Ha! ha! ha! Suppose, Master Bob, continued the Squire, diverted at the thought, " the deposit had been made last night.     36         THE MONARCHST. What an awful report the explosion would have made in the county! and I, what would I have thought of it? My man George would have been blown beyond the clouds, and no one would have been left to explain the mystery." "Yes, one would have been left, who would have explained it, and would have been bound to see you indemnified," said Percy. "True, I am sure he would have told everything!" said Ann Custis. At that moment the report of a cannon was heard down the creek; and while the startled company maintained a momentary silence, several other reports followed. ' ' That's Handy!" cried Drummond. "Mr. Handy came over with us in Captain Gibb's shallop. We saw the vessel this young gentleman speaks of lying in the creek, and Handy said he in- tended to board her before he went home. He thought it look- ed like the one said to be employed by the Governor. If he has attacked her, no doubt you, sir," he continued, addressing Per- cy, "will be altogether relieved of your charge." "It is probable," said Percy, gravely. "There were only two or three swivels on board, and some half-dozen men. I re- gret I was not with them. This looks like war!" C"Robinson," said the Squire, addressing the youngest of the brothers Custis, "ride down and see what it means." "And I will go too!" cried Thomas, the elder brother; "per- haps assistance may be needed." "Man for man!" cried Percy, rising. "If it be so, first let me go on deck to defend the shallop! It, I know, is in the legal possession of the agents of his Excellency!" "Agreed!" said Waples; " let it be so, and I will board her in spite of you!" "So be it! I am with you, Percy!" cried Master Robert Wales. "Hold!" cried the Squire, seizing a young man with each hand, and then lying back in his great chair, shook his ponderous sides, and apparently the very floor, with unrestrained laughter. This scene continued several moments without a word being spo- ken by any one. And the transports of rage which had so lately been depicted on more than one face, were perforce succeeded by a universal shout of laughter at the ludicrous expression of merri- ment displayed by the broad and almost livid features of the fat old Squire. Such was the flexibility of the temperament of the volatile young gentlemen of that period. "No; no!" said the Squire, at length. "It would be too diverting to see such striplings waging war before our very faces, ere we men have duly considered the necessity of it, and have Jafarmin;.rl tht hostilities shall be resorted to. As for you,   SI THE MONARCHST.                37 Master Bob, I will lay a wager that my turkey cock, about your height and weight, can beat you in a fair fight! So be it. hey? You are ready for the conflict at arms, with the rest, are you? Girls, I wish one of you would stand him upon the mantel-piece. Suppose we let him remain there, as a punishment for the mis- chief his tongue, which is truly equal to a lawyer's, has done? When he makes fair promises, you can take him down again." During this speech, the purple mark on Master Robert's fore- head became visible, and his eyes began to assume their terrible fierceness; but he made no reply. "Master Bob," said young Parker, we understand now, why it was that Mr. Hewitt was in such hot haste; and why you were on the road at midnight." "I believe he is one of the Governor's spies," said Wise; " but what if he is?" "Yes, what if he is?" said the Squire. "Any girl may just lift him up, and place him on the mantel-piece, and then he can do uo harm." Percy could not avoid smiling at the manifestation of ill-sup- pressed rage in the features of the diminutive object before him. i   "I am a royalist, gentlemen," finally exclaimed Wales, " and !  may have as great a heart, and as enlightened a mind as any of s  you. I cannot be answerable for my deficiency in weight or height. My limbs, however, may make up in skill what is lack- ing in length. Suppose we test the matter. Here I draw my sword," he continued, stepping out into the yard, "and I chal-  lenge any one present to cross it with his blade." Percy, smiling, followed, with an intention to disarm him. But in an instant his blade flew from his hand. The experiment was repeated, with the same result, to the astonishment of the whole d party. "Upon my life, Master Bob!" exclaimed the Squire, "I never dreamed you could fence so expertly. How have you contrived to keep the two counties in profound ignorance of your skill in that line?" "I have been called passably expert," said Percy; " but I con- fess he is my master."  "And I retract everything I have said in derogation of his prowess. Let us be reconciled, Master Robert," continued the Squire, grasping the hand of the now pleased and triumphant dwarf. In due time Robinson Custis returned from his mission, ac- companied by Mr. Hardy and Mr. John Wise, of Chesconnessex Creek, who had led the attack on the shallop, and which had re- 4     38         TTHE MONARCHST. suited in its capture. Some ten men had accomplished that-feat, without losing any of their party. The small cannon had been fired without effect, and the crew had yielded as soon as the boarding party gained the deck. The prisoners were now to be disposed of, as well as the cargo; and as it was determined that the magistrates of the county -should be requested to assemble in a few days at Drummondtown, the county seat, the whole affair, as well as the steps to be taken in view of the alarming state of things on the other side of the bay, were to be submitted to their consideration and decision.   "t        THE MONARCHST.           39 CHAPTER III. To arms To arms! haste to the field! It is no cause a judge may end; The ermine and the books must yield When swords assault and swords defend. The rattling drum and shrill-toned fife Announce the march to mortal strife; And dearest ties asunder torn, Shall make the heedless millions mourn. DURINGC the few days that elapsed between the occurrences last ;  described, and the meeting of the magistrates at the court-house, news of the most exciting character had been received. The par- ticulars of the battles of Lexington, Concord, and Bunker's Hill, H  were repeated by every one. The Congress had resolved to raise another army of twenty thousand men to be under the direction of Washington, who was already at the head of nearly fifteen ;  thousand in the neighbourhood of Boston neck, where he effectu- ally intercepted all communication between the British army un- der General Gage, and the interior of the country. In a word, the British general, although he held the city of Boston, was i regularly besieged by the colonists; and if too weak to give bat- tle, must either escape by sea, or be forced to capitulate. From England, many vessels of war had arrived at Halifax, at Boston, and in the Chesapeake.  Many additional regiments had been sent over. And to crown all, the King, in his speech to Parliament, had declared his subjects in America in a state of re- bellion; and notwithstanding the solemn warnings of Lord Chat- ham and Mr. Burke, both houses of Parliament had co-operated by large majorities, with the ministers and the King, in sanction- ing measures designed to coerce submission at the point of the bayonet. Nearer home, affairs were equally as startling to the hitherto pacific and loyal inhabitants of the eastern shore of Virginia. Lord Dunmore, having now, besides the ship Foway, the Mercu- ry of twenty-four, Kingfisher of sixteen, and Otter of fdci#een guns, and several companies of regular troops, with as many more of tories and negroes, had sailed to Norfolk. He had seized Holt's printing press, and sent many tenders and barges in differ- ent directions to devastate the coasts.     40         THE MONARCHST. The colonial convention, which had been driven from James- town, had assembled at Richmond, and resolved to raise three regiments immediately, under the command, respectively, of Pat- rick Henry, Colonel Woodford, and William Christian. The vol- unteers were desired to wear hunting shirts, in accordance with Washington's recommendation when men were raised to fight the Indians and French, some fifteen or twenty years before. And immediately Colonel Woodford succeeded in gathering a hundred men with rifles, and took post at Hampton, which village, almost in sight of Norfolk, he was determined to defend. The universal panic had driven home all the vessels belonging to the eastern shore, whose commanders and crews, as well as most of the male population of the county of Accomac, were as- sembled at the court-house on the day appointed for the meeting of the magistrates. Many of the ladies of the county were like- wise present, evincing the irrepressible interest they felt in the deliberations of a body of men, upon whose decision perhaps de- pended the welfare, if not the lives, of their husbands, brothers, and sons. Squire West had been accompanied to town by his daughters, Miss Custis, and Percy. His stately old coach-and carriages at that time were not so abundant as they are at thigaay in those level counties-had been drawn by four horses, neJy one to each person occupying a seat within; and yet they haX paced along with slow dignity, as if impressed with the matters of grave importance contemplated in silence by their master. The magistrates were seated upon the bench; the ladies in thA gallery; while the area of the bar and the space beyond, and even the capacious yard in the rear, and street in front, were crowded with people, expressing by their features the deep inte- rest they felt in the momentous subject which had brought them together. For several years past they had been accustomed to the knowledge of the existence of severe disputes between the King's governors and the Council-they had heard, with various senti- ments (for some approved, while others condemned), of frequent dissolutions of the House of Burgesses; and they were even cog- nisant of the fact, that threats had been uttered of a purpose to resist the authority of the Crown, in matters where it was asserted that the ministers had violated the spirit of the constitution, and manifestly encroached upon the unalienable rights of the people: but hitherto they had not contemplated the real consequences of actual war; and now, although evidently unprepared for such a condition of things, they could not close their eyes to the fact that war, with all its terrors, actually existed.       THE MONARCHST.          41 The comparatively few words spoken in the dense and anxious crowd present, when friends and neighbours met and greeted each other with the civility usual on such occasions, were uttered in low tones; and, save the delight expressed by an individual here and there who exulted in the stirring scenes of martial excitement supposed to be about to ensue, and who were in advance of the rest in comprehension of the merits and probable results of the impending conflict, a solemn gloom seemed to pervade the vast assembly. A mournful silence reigned within the court-house. The magistrates sat like statues, awaiting some proposition or motion from the members of the bar below. But what was to be done? Why were they assembled on that occasion? These embarrassing questions each one, now for the first time, asked himself. Cer- tainly the occurrences transpiring either out of the county or within it, which then monopolized the thoughts of all men, were not of such a nature as to be embraced within the scope of the legitimate duties of that tribunal. But, being met together, as by common consent, and with one impulse, it was the unanimous impression that something or other, and no one seemed to know exactly what, should at least be attempted. At length, Mr. John Wise, who was a prominent lawyer, and who had led the party in the capture of the shallop, rose up, and submitted to the court that some disposition should be made of the articles taken on that occasion, as well as of the prisoners, some half dozen in number, now waiting before them. He like- wise suggested that according to the usual custom in prizes, the captors were entitled to receive an equitable distribution of the proceeds of the sale of both the vessel and cargo. His motion was seconded by young Harry Parker, who had been recently admitted to the bar, and supported by Mr. Thomas Cropper, a brother of John Cropper, who was an enthusiastic whig, and zealous advocate of the war. But before any response was uttered by the court, Mr. George Scarborough, son of the aged Colonel, who occupied a seat upon the bench between Squires West and Seymour, rose up, and inti- mated a desire to express an opinion on the subject. In the first place, he would have it distinctly understood that it was not his purpose on that occasion, to express any opinion in relation to the merits of the questions which formed the subject of the un- happy disagreement between the colonies adad the mother coun- try. They were not assembled before that tribaial for such a purpose. When it should become necessary for him to speak on that point, his sentiments would be freely and boldly declared.   I     42         THE MONARCIIST. But at the present juncture, he deemed it his duty to suggest that the court had no jurisdiction whatever in the case presented before it. "What," he exclaimed, " would the gentlemen who have just spoken, have this court decide upon? A matter of ex- change,. or incarceration of prisoners taken with arms in open warfare? Are they the enemies of the country? To what nation, with which we are at war, do they belong'? Why, they are our neighbours, most of them known to us, living and trading in our midst. What have they done? Bargained with the Governor of the colony, and the only Governor known in it, to convey a certain amount of freight a certain distance, for a stipulated sum of money. Can your honours decide a matter of this nature? Or if it must be submitted to your adjudication, can you determine the cause in the way the gentlemen have indicated? By what' authority will you act? You are the King's justices of the peace. If you decide that the King's authority is null, what becomes of your own? You have not been commissioned by any of the con- ventions voluntarily assembled on the other side of the bay, nor by the Congress sitting in Philadelphia. Clearly, then, I cannot conceive how your honours can hesitate for a moment to dismiss this proposition, at least as it regards your judicial capacity." While the magistrates were conferring together, it became quite apparent to every one present, that the county court was not the proper tribunal to determine such matters, and the stillness which had prevailed was succeeded by a buzz of voices, uttering various suggestions, in all parts of the room. At length it was announced from the bench, that the justices had no authority to determine anything in such cases and under such circumstances. If it was a case of war, it w'as a subject for a military tribunal; if a civil matter, they did not see that an} crime had been committed by the prisoners' by which they could be retained in custody. During the delivery of this opinion, young Percy hastily sepa- rated himself from the ladies in the gallery, and having pushed through the crowd, stood up among the lawyers, and begged to be permitted to utter a few words. "I hope your honours," said he, "before retiring from the bench, if such should be your purpose, will consider that inas- much as no offence has been committed by these men, who were in reality under my command, and whose fate it was my purpose to share when I came hither this morning, it must follow as a matter of course, that a very serious offence has been committed by their assailants; an offence, I conceive, which clearly falls within the jurisdiction of the civil authority-that of PIRACY!"       THE MONARCH;IST.         43 Astonishment and rage were instantly depicted in a hundred faces, and words of passion were uttered from. all parts of the house. Not far from the bold young man who had spoken such words, however, stood both Mr. Hewitt and Mr. MacCoskie the clergymen, who manifested their approbation of the speech. But the torrent of sentiment was too obviously in favour of the opposite side; and the magistrates, although staggered at the seeming rationality of the alternative presented by the handsome and youthful champion of the Governor, were silent from inde- cision. Mr. Wise, however, sat perfectly still, until the agitation of the moment subsided, with a triumphant smile resting upon his face, and his clear eagle-eyes sparkling with extraordinary ani- mation. His indomitable character was universally known, and from the workings of his features, every one near him, and especially the justices, anticipated an impassioned outhurst of invective in reply. But they were somewhat deceived. "Gentlemen!" said he, with constrained and impressive de- liberation, "I am not about to reply to the silly words of that foolish boy. Matters of more importance demand our attention. If the court is not now sitting for the transaction of- business in its judicial capacity, I would thank your honours to signify it;  and with that view I move an adjournment!" "The court is adjourned!" said Squire Seymour, after a mo- ment's consultation with his brother justices. "Then, we, the People, are assembled in our majesty!" con- tinued Mr. Wise, in a loud voice; " and I move that we orga- nize the meeting by electing the magistrates, now on the bench, our presiding officers. Those who approve the motion, say ay." This was boisterously responded to in the affirmative. "Now!" continued the orator, "let King George's butcher, or any of his minions, come on! I am in order, now; and this is a tribunal with ample powers to decide the matters we have come hither to discuss. Something must be decided, something must be done, if we do not mean to have our unresisting throats cut, and our houses reduced to ashes over our heads. For my part, if George III. was my father, instead of my King, I would arm myself to defend my home against his assassins. While we are standing here, who knows that the torch is not being applied to the dwelling he left this morning? -Has not the monster Dunmore Bent forth a fleet of barges and tenders to devastate our shores? Who did not behold the illuminations last night on the opposite side of the bay? I marked distinctly some twenty. The ques- tion is not now one of principle merely, or of right and wrong;   M     "         THE MONARCHST. but one of self-defence. If Lord Dunmore had no enterprise against us in meditation, why has he sent arms and ammunition among us? He knew there were many tories in the county, and he designed to arm them against the rest!" "Permit me to correct you," said Percy, very calmly; "I am assured his Lordship's purpose was merely to send them to a place of security, so that they could not be used at all." "I deny that 1" exclaimed Thomas Custis; "the object was, whatever he may have made this young man believe, to form a magazine here for the use of the King." "He had a right to do so. These counties are part of the King's dominions," replied Percy. "I repeat," continued Wise, "we are not now to discuss matters of abstract right; theory is abolished; at least for the present. I hold in my hand a letter from Colonel Woodford, just received, brought over by a schooner which ran into Pungo- teague creek not two hours ago, and which must rouse the pro- per spirit in the breasts of all who have the hearts of men." This letter had been handed him when he had been inter- rupted in his remarks, and he had glanced over it during the colloquy between Percy and Custis. V "Here," continued he, "is the letter :-ampton, Monday, Aug., 1775. Dear Sir-The British Captain Squires, at the head of six barges, attacked us yesterday. We beat them of without losing a man. At night they came again, and we had it as hot as --. The air was a blaze of rockets, bursting bombs, and red-hot balls. We took two of their barges, defeated the rest and drove them off. Fifteen or twenty men on each side killed; I know not how many wounded. YThe houses are all riddled by cannon-balls. Your uncle lost all his teeth by a can- non-ball. Stir up the people. No time is to be lost. Yours truly, but in haste." This intelligence spread a thrill of deep emotion throughout the assembly, and the conclusion of it, particularly, produced a general shiver among the numerous relatives present of the indi- vidual who had been the special victim of the cannon-ball named at the conclusion of the epistle. "I can explain how old Mr. Wise lost his teeth," said Cap- tain East, commander of the schooner just arrived from the neighbourhood of Hampton; "I saw him this morning, and he told me how it was." "Saw him? Told you?" cried several, and the nephew John Wise could not avoid smiling, for East had already explained it to him.                       -       THE MONARCHST.          45 "Yes," continued East, "I saw him, and he was quite well, but as savage as a meat-axe against the British and tories. A cannon-ball went through his house, and smashed the bureau where he kept all his teeth that have fallen out these thirty years. No person was in the house. The women were in the woods, and old George was shooting a musket twice a minute. When I left him his face was as black as a nigger's with burnt powder." "But, you see, gentlemen," continued Wise, "war, war, is the word. Our towns are attacked, our friends and kindred slaugh- tered, and our property destroyed. Shall we look on quietly and fold our arms?" "No! no!" cried a great many. "D-- d if I do, for one!" cried Waples, slapping his hands furiously. "I am with you, Sam, to the hilt!" cried Thomas Custis. The young ladies in the gallery became very pale, and were prevailed upon by Mr. MacCoskie to retire to the inn, kept by Dick Revel. "Gentlemen!" said Captain John Cropper; "I have likewise a letter to read. If there has been no regular authority to act in the matters of prisoners and prizes heretofore, there is now, and will be hereafter." The letter was from Major Matthews, an- nouncing that he was empowered by Congress to raise troops on the eastern shore, subject to the rules and regulations adopted for the continental service. He authorized Captain Cropper to or- ganize a company immediately, to join the army, and to operate in the field under the orders of General Charles Lee, who was to command the southern army. He said likewise it was General Washington's advice to the inhabitants of the counties on the bay, to. organize militia companies for their own defence. "Now, gentlemen," said Mr. Wise, "which side are we on? I, for one, am resolved to defend my country!"This was re- sponded to with boisterous shouts of approval. "Gentlemen," said Colonel Scarborough, rising, "we, who occupy the chairs upon the bench, must be addressed by the speakers; and, according to parliamentary rule, we alone should put the questions to the vote. If we have no authority as magistrates in a meeting of this character, we may, at least, and I do, for one, claim the prerogative due the presiding officers of it." "True, Wise, he is right!" cried several. "I would not have you understand, gentlemen," continued the Colonel, " that I disapprove what is evidently the sentiment of my friends; but I desire to have our proceedings conducted   O i     "         THE MONARCHST.  in a correct and formal manner. You who are in favour of or- ganizing a force to protect our lives and property against any i foes whoever they may be, and whencesoever they may come, will signify it by saying ay"   .!" This was followed by an immense affirmative response. "Those of the contrary opinion," he continued, "will say ; A very few feeble "noes" were heard; but those who uttered  them were not perceived. "The ayes have it!" said the Colonel. "Gentlemen," said Squire West, " my swelled, and bandaged foot will prevent me from rising; but I must beg to say a few words on this occasion. As to arming the people for the pre- servation of their homes, and for the defence of their liberties, whether they be assailed by strangers or the instruments of the King, you may be assured the measure will have my hearty concurrence. We are free-born subjects of the British Crown, and are entitled to all the privileges that any others are, wher- ever they may reside; and in defence of my rights, I would as freely perish as the next man. It is true," he continued, smiling, "I am past the age for much marching, or much shoot- ing, unless shooting platoons of chalk-stones from my fingers and toes at the foe, could be of avail; yet in a just cause, I might do something otherwise.  But my object is to sug- gest to my friends and neighbours, that it may be the wisest policy for them to confine themselves, for the present, strictly to a defensive attitude. The King may not really sanction the violence of his agents; the ministers may be changed; and the governors and commanders may be recalled.  Should these things happen, and I would wait a reasonable length of time to see, then I would prefer not to stand in the attitude of hostility to the monarch." This speech was followed by tokens of approbation generally. "May it please your honours," said Captain Cropper, "I would have it put to the sense of this meeting, if these men (pointing to the captives) are not to be considered prisoners of war?" "I second the motion," said Mr. Wise. "Gentlemen!" said Colonel Scarborough, "you have heard the question. Those in favour of retaining these men as prisoners, will say ay." The response was so general, that the Colonel was on the eve of announcing it carried; but after a slight hesitation he de- manded the noes of those of a contrary opinion. There was but   THE MONARCIIST.          47 one "No;" but it was uttered in a loud, firm tone, and attracted the attention of all. It was spoken by Percy.  "Then," continued Captain Cropper, " since such is the judg- ment of the meeting, of course Mr. Percy, by his own confession, must stand in the same predicament as those who were found on board the vessel." "Undoubtedly, sir!" said Percy, joining the captives. "Hold! gentlemen 1" said Squire West. "That young man is my guest. The laws of hospitality, to which none of you are strangers, must exempt him from molestation. Whatever may have been his relative position when on board the shallop, I con- ceive it to have been changed when he took up his abode under my roof. He was not engaged in any hostile enterprise, nor had he meditated any demonstration against the peace of the county." "He had the whole cargo of arms and ammunition under his charge, and intended to land it in the night, as I can prove by his friend, Master Robert Wales, if he is present," said Thomas Custis. Master Robert was not present, though not far away. "Thomas!" said Squire Luker, "are you going to convert this meeting again into a court? Do you wish to examine wit- nesses? Methinks the statement of Squire West is sufficient." "If it be deficient, hear mine," said Percy. "It is true I had the cargo in charge. My orders were to find a place of security in which to deposit it, and to remain by it. I was not informed what uses it would be put to. But it is equally true that I de- clared in the presence of several, and that gentleman among the rest, previously to its being captured, the nature of my mission; and, moreover, being satisfied from certain intelligence, that it really belonged to the people of the colony, I expressed my de- termination to hold it subject to their order." That is true," said Thomas Custis. "But, nevertheless, as it is presumable your crew could be no better informed than yourself, of the purposes of Lord Dunmore, I do not see why we should make flesh of one party and fish of the other." "Very logical, Master Tom!" said Mr. Wise. "I think, your honours, as there can be no doubt that war actually exists, we may, at all events, hold the vessel and cargo as lawful prize." "Stick to that point, Wise!" said young George Scarborough. "I think you are right. But as this is no legal tribunal, and as I can only speak as a lawyer, I have no opinion to offer." "I move that the question be taken on it," said Lieutenant Handy. It was done, and decided in the affirmative. "Gentlemen!" said Squire West, now rising, and forgetful of     48         THE MONARCHST. his gout, I desire that Master Percy may be permitted to retire, without the formality of a vote." "I object!" said Captain Cropper. "I act under the authority of Congress, subject to the immediate orders of my superior officers; and by that authority I claim him, and the rest of the captives as my prisoners." "If that is to be the determination of the meeting, I must leave the bench!" said Squire West, who had remained stand- ing, but now descended and limped out of the house. "Let him go, Cropper," said Wise. "I will not go, unless my men go with me!" said Percy. "You may all go upon your parole," said Captain Cropper. "I will not give it!" said the young man. "Then, sir, you remain a prisoner." All the rest, however, except one, who was Percy's footman, found no difficulty in embracing the Captain's terms, and were discharged. 7 4   THE MONARCHST.          49 CHAPTER IV. No more the hospitable smile, Nor stroll romantic on the lawn, Nor song of maiden more beguile The moments fleet of rosy dawn! The deep-voiced cannon in the bay Calls the heroic youth away, But mortal wounds are dealt, I ween, On tender hearts by shafts unseen. DICK REVEL'S inn, at Drummondtown, was considered an old building at the time of the Revolution. It is still standing, and occupied as an inn. It is a high-roofed building, having a num- ber of small apartments on the second floor, but most of them with ceilings of unequal height. As usual at that period, a porch ran along the entire length of the building in front, while in the rear, and corresponding in extent, an enclosed appendage to the original structure answered the purpose of a dining-room. The house was a frame one, as were nearly, if not quite all, the tenements in that country, but with ends and chimneys of black brick. On the right of the hall, when entering from the porch, was a square room of respectable dimensions, which served as a sitting apartment or parlour. It was into this room that the daughters of the Squire and their cousin had been conducted by Mr. MacCoskie, during the scene of excitement at the court-house. They were followed soon after by Master Robinson Custis, and who remained with them, notwithstanding he had been repeatedly called for both by his brother Thomas and Samuel Waples, to unite with them in the cause of America. They now sat in a corner of the room impatiently awaiting the result of the boisterous meeting, the shouts that were occasionally uttered being distinctly heard by them. In a corner of the same room sat Master Robert Wales, en- gaged in an animated conversation, though conducted in low tones, with two ladies, evidently strangers in th-e county, and from the resemblance in features, no one would have hesitated to prq- nounce them mother and daughter, which was truly the case. 5  \f     60         THE MONARCHST.  The former had, perhaps, seen some fifty years, while the latter  could not have been more than twenty. The one, although smallest in stature, was straight in form, had a bright eye, soft pale cheek, dark hair, fine teeth, and handsomely chiselled chin, indicating that she had possessed much beauty in her youth; the other, having in perfection all the charms of which comparatively merely the traces remained in the mother, presented a most fasci- nating appearance. Her fair face was beautifully adorned by a deli- cate hue of health on either cheek; but what most arrested the attention of the beholder, was something thrilling in the expression of her large dark eyes, whose sparkling glances, serious, and often sad, seemed to vibrate in unison with the emotions of the uncontrollable spirit which heaved within her bosom. They were attired in blue riding-habits, faced with white; their velvet hoods were thrown back, and the dark glossy ringlets of the daughter fell in profusion on her fair neck and shoulders. "Yet it is inexplicable to me," said Master Robert, pondering, with his head inclined downward, " why Mr. Kingsburgh should have so soon committed himself, in the cause of King George. Doubtless it is our policy to uphold the Crown; but not always the head that wears it. I may affect to advocate the measures of King George, and may really support them sincerely, when the object is to annihilate the new-born ideas of independency, and of republics; for nobody here, or in England, has conceived a suspicion that I can be of the least service to either side, or do the slightest injury to any party. But it may be different with Kingsburgh; he, as well as yourself, madam, have become subjects of history. In every city in Christendom your portrait, in particular, is exhibited; and the effect may be surmised, when it is known that your husband, whose whole race were devoted to the line of Princes which Providence placed upon the thrones of Scotland and England, is embarked in the cause of the Ger-  mans," "It is bootless to express vain regret," replied Mrs. Kings- burgh.  My opinion accorded with yours; but he would not be controlled by me. I fear he despairs of seeing the true Prince restored to his own. But I shall never despair, while  life lasts; nor cease to strive for the accomplishment of the great object of my life. No greater perils can beset my path than I have already passed through; and whatever difficulties may present themselves hereafter, I shall not be dismayed, When I cease to live, I will leave one to continue the pursuit in  which I have been engaged. Flora has been taught and trained for the mission. She has the qualifications necessary to be the   THE MONARCIIST.          51 representative of her mother. But we came hither to find a safe asylum, and to watch the progress of events. Where shall we stay? What shall we do? Shall we remain unknown to the people, or freely declare who we are and what we desire?" "Mother," said the daughter, "I have learned that the princi- pal families here are mostly the descendants of the persecuted cavaliers who abandoned England when Cromwell and his sanguinary psalm-singing hypocrites not only dethroned the King of glorious memory, but banished honour, noble titles, and chivalry from the realm; and since they are of the same race as those who, while there was a hope remaining, were ever wil- ling and proud to spill their precious blood in the cause of their true Prince, I see no reason why we should conceal ourselves, or hesitate to declare our sentiments. Who knows but we may rouse the sympathies, and revive the ardour of the high-spirited young gentry of this country in behalf of Charles Edward?" "I do not see any objection to such a course," said Wales. "Why should we not have Jacobites here as well as elsewhere? There are tens of thousands of them at home, and some may be found in both houses of parliament. Nay, it is suspected one or two of the ministers of George III. are that way inclined." Then," continued the young lady, "why not bring hither the first characters of the county, now assembled in the village, and present them to us? We will inform them of the merits of their true Prince." Master Robert bit his lip, as he thought for a moment what those merits really were. "And why not, after all," said Wales, "rather encourage the idea of resistance, than submission to King George? I must confer with Mr. MacCoskie on the subject. I am a monarchist, and would rather have George III., than a mob of democrats, or no king at all; but still I prefer to have the Stuarts, if possi- ble. If we could promote dissension between the people and George III. without raising up a republic, it seems to me it would not be the worst policy. I will converse with Mr. Mao Coskie on the subject; but first, I will present the daughters of Squire West, and their cousin." Saying this, Master Robert at once put in execution his design, by approaching the young ladies with extreme politeness, whom he conducted, followed by Master Robinson, to where the mother and daughter sate, and having performed the ceremony of intro. duction, he left them to make mutual explanations, to their own satisfaction. He then joined Mr. MacCoskie, whd knew per. fectly well who the strangers were, and had conversed with them     52         THE MONARCHST. that morning. But as it had not been then decided in what  capacity they should appear, he had merely mentioned them as persons who had fled from the scene of conflict on the western  side of the bay. He was therefore somewhat startled when Wales announced to him that Mrs. Kingsburgh intended to make known that she was no other than the once famous Flora MacDonald, who had saved the life of Charles Edward. '"It can do no harm," said Mr. MacCoskie. "But it may do good," replied Wales. "In what manner?"  "In the confusion which may ensue from these civil wars, the Stuarts may be restored." "I have long since despaired of that," said the clergyman, shaking his head. "If they cannot be put upon the throne of Great Britain, they might reign here." "Never! you forget their religion. Charles Edward is -a Roman Catholic, and his brother is now a Cardinal, at Rome." "I am happy to inform you that Mrs. Kingsburgh has recently received a letter from his Majesty, stating that he will soon re- nounce his Roman tenets, at Liege. The Pope, deterred by a protest from Sir Horace Mann, the British minister, residing at Florence, has declined recognising Chrles Edward as the right- ful King of England. This ingratitude, after the Prince's grand- father sacrificed his crown for the sake of that church, has caused the indignant Prince to form his resolution. Nay, Mr. Mac- Coskie, from the evidences we- see, here and elsewhere, it would be but a vain endeavour to attempt to breast the storm. The people are everywhere at variance with George III.; they can- not be persuaded to submit. It seems to me that nothing re- mains but for us, who would not see a wild democracy rise up in the place of the form of government which undoubtedly has the divine sanction, to pave the way for a restoration of the Stuarts. Then, the way to begin, is rather to render the dispute between George III. and the people irreconcilable, than to promote an adjustment of their differences." "The aspect becomes more gloomy, and the result morb un- certain," said Mr. MacCoskie, in despondency. "The storm is bursting in every direction; and the demon of discord is revel- ling in ungovernable violence. God alone knows what the end is likely to be. We must bow to the fury of the blast. The romantic story of Flora MacDonald will be listened to with ad- miration, when repeated by her own lips, and those of her charm- ing daughter, the exact counterpart of her mother when she was I1    THE MONARCHST.          53 young; but I fear the house of Stuart is doomed to extinction, in the direct line. Charles Edward is given up to. the allure- ments of dissipation, and his brother is in the College of Cardi- nals. There is no prospect of male issue beyond them." Just then young Percy, attended by his footman John, was brought in by Mr. Sneed, the sherit. "You are my prisoner, now, sir," said Mr. Sneed; " and you must promise me you will not attempt to escape; or else, as I am responsible for your person whenever it shall be demanded, it will be my duty to place you in dlose confnement.'j "I will promise nothing!" replied Percy. "Who is a prisoner?" exclaimed the sisters and Ann Custis, who had that morning rode in the same coach which brought the young Englishman to the village. "War is declared, ladies," said Mr. Sneed; "and as they are killing and capturing the Americans across the bay, we are se- curing such of the British as we can find on our side, as an off- set, as they say in court." He is father's guest!" said the daughters of the old Squire; "and nothing short of having committed some crime, can justify you, or any one, in detaining him as a prisoner." "He has been guilty of a constructive act of war, in bringing over arms for the use of the King's soldiers," replied- the sheriff. "But by what authority do you hold him?" asked a young lawyer, by the name of Finny, who stood near the door, and could not resist the impulse of taking the side of the ladies. "Where's your warrant, Mr. Sheriff?" "I have no warrant, it is true; but the verbal order of Captain Cropper, and the decision of the. meeting, ought to be sufficient." 'Take care you do not get into trouble! This may prove to be a serious case of false imprisonment." "I must see about that," said the sheriff. "W ill you promise not to escape," he continued, addressing his prisoner, " during the next ten minutes, while I can consult with Mr. Scarborough, and see the Captain?" "I said I would promise nothing," replied Percy, smiling. "I will answer for him," said Finny. "That is nobly said!" remarked Flora, whose snowy forehead and expressive eyes had seemed to fascinate the young lawyer from the moment he beheld her. "But who is he? and why is he. in custody?" she continued. "He is Master Harry Percy, my father's guest," said Fanny West; " and he has been arrested because he was engaged in the execution of some order of Lord Dunmore's." 5*     54         THE MONARCHST.  "A Percy!' exclaimed Miss Kingsburgh, fixing her large a liquid eyes full upon him. "One of a noble house! His remote ancestors were mighty about the throne of the Stuarts, the true line of Princes. But now, alas! even Northumberland upholds the house of Hanover! Yet a brighter day may dawn for the unfortunate. Sir, I grieve to see you thus; I mean in captivity. I am one of those who lament for the distresses of the great. Behold my mother. She it was who perilled life for the salva- tion of Charles Edward--"  "True!" said Percy, interrupting her. "I see a resemblance of our pictures of Flora MacDonald in her-in you it is still greater." "And hence," continued the young enthusiast, "I feel pained to see you thus. But I doubt both the justice and the success of the cause in which you are embarked." "How is this?" said Percy. "Lord Dunmore has written home to the King, that Mr. Kingsburgh was the first subject in North Carolina who took up arms in behalf of his Majesty." "True, sir; but it was rather in behalf of the royal preroga- tive, than in the service of the present King's cause. When better informed of the real merits of the question, I doubt not he will retire from the field." "And enlist with us under General Washington," said Mr. Finny, desiring to coincide in opinion with the fair enchantress. ' Do you intend to enlist?" asked Mrs. Kingsburgh, observ- ing that Flora did not seem to have noticed his words. "No, madam, not exactly that. To enlist, presupposes that one enters the service as a private. My fortune, education, and family, should entitle me to expect a suitable rank in the army. I meant to say would embark in the same cause." A drum was now heard without. Captain- Cropper was beat- ing up volunteers. Waples and Thomas Custis, having been the first to respond to his call, were to be his lieutenants. Already some fifty men had signed their names, and pledged themselves ' to serve in the continental army, as volunteers, and for an indefi- nite period; while three or four hundred others signified their purpose of serving along the coast of the county, for the defence of .the peninsula, and they were engaged in designating their officers, and points of rendezvous. Squire West, who had retired from the court-house when it, was decided that Percy should be detained as a prisoner, was seeking his daughters. He condemned that portion of the pro- ceedings of his neighbours which seemed to violate a principle of hospitality, the sanctities of which were never more rigidly  'I   THE MONARCHST.          55 observed in any portion of the empire than they had been hitherto in that section of Virginia. Meeting with the two clergymen, Hewitt and MacCoskie, who were discussing the signs of the times, and weighing the sug- gestions of Master Robert, who had suddenly become a personage of vast importance in their estimation, they proceeded together to the apartment where the ladies were sitting. "Ho! I have found you at last," said the Squire; "and Master Percy, too? I supposed, sir, they had confined you in some dark dungeon before this. I am glad to see you at liberty again, and that they have some regard for me, after all." "Father," said Ann, "he is still a prisoner, and we expect to see him dragged away every minute." "Can you not save him, father?" asked Frances. "I think you may accomplish more than I can, girls. Sup- pose you take him along with you? Put him in the carriage and---what the d--  1 does this mean?" added he, seeing Waples and the eldest Custis enter with their swords drawn. "We have been sent here by Captain Cropper," said the first, "to take charge of the prisoners, Mr. Percy and his footman." "Gentlemen," said Mrs. Kingsburgh, "it is not the custom in war to consider servants as prisoners." "And who is she, and that pretty younfg stranger?" asked the Squire, aside, of Master Robert, who instantly introduced him, and in few words explained who they were. "True, madam; it is very true, menials are not made pri- soners, as these novices must learn. Albeit, I am informed that Lord Dunmore, who should set the example of propriety, is now making free with our slaves; nay, arming them, and leading them against their masters." "But you will not suffer Mr. Percy to be kept as a prisoner!" said Ann Custis, addressing Waples. "I must obey orders. I am an officer now; the Captain's lieutenant. Some of you frightened Mr. Sneed so-" "It was I, Sam," said Mr. Finny. "So that he would have nothing to do with him; and the Captain sent Tom and myself to secure him. I am sorry ; but orders must be obeyed, you know. Perhaps his Lordship will exchange a dozen good men for him." "Officer for officer of the same rank, and private for private," said Mrs. Kingsburgh. "At least, he may be permitted to stay at my house, whence hecame this morning?" asked the Squire, in rather a haughty tone.     56         THE MONARCHST.  "He may, if he will promise not to attempt to make his escape," said Thomas Custis. "And that I am not disposed to do," said the youthful captive, smiling. "Ladies, and kind sir," he continued, turning to the Squire, who was supported on either hand by his daughters, "I beg that you will not be concerned for me; no manner of injury can happen to my person, even in the event of its being decided that I am a bona fide pris?ner of war. I cannot suppose I will be treated differently from others in similar circumstances." "Certainly not!" said Captain Cropper, who, as well as a great many others, and mostly the leading men of the county, now filled the room. "No doubt some of us will fall into the hands of the enemy, and we should be careful to do unto others as we desire they shall do unto us. If Mr. Percy prefers my house as his prison, with the exception of the surveillance of a guard, I will promise that he shall not want for anything necessary to his comfort." This declaration seemed to appease the ladies, who were apt to associate something terrible with the idea of a prisoner of war. Master Robert, who had been industriously employed in dis- seminating the news that the fair strangers at the inn were the famous Flora MacDonald, now Mrs. Kingsburgh, and her daugh- ter, seized the occasion of introducing to them most of the gen-  tlemen present. And these ladies, making no hesitation in denouncing George III., and his cause, embraced the opportunity to unite with the Misses West and Miss Custis in soliciting the release of Percy. "What is your opinion, Waples?" asked the Captain.  "My opinion has already been expressed; but I will repeat it. If the colonies have an enemy in them, he is one, and Bob Wales, there, is another." "I beg your pardon, Master Thomas!" said Wales. "I do not intend to bear arms against America. Events have trans- pired since we conversed the other night, which have modified my opinions." While thus replying, Wales signified to Percy by a wink, that more was meant than expressed; or that he deemed it proper to dissemble. "I think we can prevent him from escaping from the county," said the Captain; "and therefore we will permit him to go home with the Squire."  And you, sir, need not come to watch him!" remarked Ann  Custis, in a low, reproachful voice to Waples; and then, with a  !   T'lE IV MONARCHST.        57 slight frown, she turned away, and took the young captive's arm, preparatory to their departure. Waples felt that he had offended his mistress; and he resolved that if Percy should be an obstacle to a union with the one he loved, he would indeed be his enemy. "I hope, madam," said the Squire, when taking leave' of the strangers, "that you iand your amiable daughter will make it convenient to honour my house with -your preseic e as much as possible during your stay on this shore." The invitation was accepted, and the only excuse alleged for not proceeding to Deep Creek immediately, was the absence of their baggage, which was to be brought from the vessel to Drum- mondtown, and might at that moment be on the way thither; The next morning, while John Wise, Esq., was partaking of an early breakfast at his mother's table, and detailing the events of the preceding day, one of the negroes ran into the house with distracted eyes and open mouth, endeavouring in vain to explain the cause of his consternation. He stuttered incoherently, as most negroes do under such circumstances, and pointed down the Chesconnessex Creek. But if poor Sambo could not make him- self intelligible, the object of his terror soon made its own an- nouncement. One after another, at short intervals, the booming of cannon struck upon the astonished ears of the neighbourhood; and, as the atmosphere was quite still, the rebounding echoes, as they answered each other from creek to creek, and grove to grove, not only roused the inhabitants for many miles round, but seemed to make a no less impression on the earth itself, which vibrated sensibly under the astounding reports. It was the British ship Mercury, of twenty-four guns; and it was soon plainly seen by Mr. Wise himself, from the yard of the house in which but a minute before he had been quietly sitting, and never dreaming of danger. It came, with all sails set, under a scarcely perceptible breeze, moving with the flowing tide directly up the creek, and in a line which must bring the muz- zles of its guns within two hundred yards of the house. No precious moments were to be lost, enjoying the fine specta- cle. No body of men had yet met together to guard that part of the coast, although the figure of speech made use of the day before, by Mr. Wise himself, might indicate that such an occur- rence as this had found a place in his imagination. Yet so it was, that no effectual preparation had been made for such a contingency, and no possible means then-available existed to oppose the invaders. "tun, Sambo!" said Mr. Wise, "run and tell the negroes to     58         THE MONARCHST.  hide in the woods, or the British will kill them all. Mother, we must run, too!" "Stop, John!" said the old lady, "I must save my spoons!"  She then very carefully gathered up the corners of the table  linen, and making a crash of its promiscuous contents, altogether  unmindful of the crockery, which evidently suffered many frac-  tures (and which being of the old Canton ware, would at this  day have been held in higher esteem than its weight in silver), she hastened into the garden and buried the burden securely by . means of a spade which had fortunately been left there, and in despite both of the booming cannon, every instant approaching still closer to the vicinity, and of the impatient gestures of her son. But, as it appeared afterwards that merely blank cartridges were fired, of course no one was hurt. No blood was shed but that of pigs and poultry; and no houses were burned. Lord Dunmore, his spouse, and their favourite Captain Foy, it seemed, in their flight from the land to the ships on the western shore, had not taken the precaution to carry with them on board a sup- ply of the dainties they had been accustomed to find on their table at Williamsburg; and subsequently having prolonged their deprivation until their sufferings were become really intolerableJ) his Excellency had been induced to despatch the Mercury on a ! victualling expedition. The captain of the ship was likewise in- structed to look after the arms and ammunition sent over in charge of Master Percy, and to have an interview with that  young gentleman, for the purpose of learning more precisely the existing sentiment of the people, which his Lordship hardly doubted was generally loyal. So firmly was he impressed with that belief, that the commander of the ship was ordered on no account to do the inhabitants any injury. But when the Mer- cury approached the entrance to the creek, and hailed some loyal fishermen, who had often contributed to supply his Lordship's table, at remunerative prices, with sheep's-head and pig-fish, the commander learned that the whole peninsula was in an extreme : state of agitation, and seemed to be upon the eve of engaging in i the general rebellion. Upon being informed that the shallop  which brought over the ammunition and arms, had been taken by its captors into the Chesconnessex Creek, and still had its  cargo on board, he at once decided to make free with the prize,  and at the same time at least to startle the ears of the natives  with the warning voice of H. B. M.'s cannon. As might have been and certainly was foreseen, under the circumstances, the inhabitants fled in all directions, and thus afforded the commander    THE MONARCHST.          59 an opportunity not only to transfer the cargo of the shallop to the magazine of the Mercury, but to send some fifty marines on shore in the boats to gather dainty provisions for his Excellency without the slightest molestation. The officers commanding these victualling parties were provided with money to pay a reasonable price for'whatever they should take, as might be agreed to by the parties disposing of the articles. It may be supposed there were no disputes, since the party selling happened to be absent. The officers, however, it is but fair to acknowledge, left upon the tables in the vacated houses they visited, certain sums of money, which doubtless were duly entered in the pur- ser s book, but which, in most cases, were considerately taken care of by the lagging men of the British parties. There was one individual into whose breast the sound of the cannon had not stricken any terror. The daughters of Squire West, and their cousin Ann Custis, accompanied by Harry Percy and Robinson Custis, were gayly cantering through the pines not more than a mile distant, when the report of the first gun was heard. "That is from one of His Britannic Majesty's ships!" said Percy, drawing the reins so abruptly as to throw his horse on his haunches. "Again!" said he, at the sound of the next gun, and repeated the word as each succeeding discharge was heard, his excitement increasing every moment. "Oh, what does it mean?" exclaimed the girls, in alarm. "It is a signal-a signal for me!" said Percy. A clatter of hoofs was heard approaching, and upon looking behind them, they recognised Miss Flora Kingsburgh, attended by Mr. Finny, who had been selected by the enthusiastic girl to attend her in an early ride from Drummondtown to Squire West's. After brief greetings, Percy announced his purpose of embark- ing on board the ship, and reporting himself to the Governor, as soon as he could find him. "Meeting and parting; smiles and sadness. It was thus when ny mother was young," said Flora, with a pale face, and her large dark eyes expressing a wildness of feeling which riveted the attention of all. "Blood may flow; hearts may be broken; and meet the one who has the right to wear the diadem, is still a wanderer. Percy! I charge thee, strike not for the usurper! Glance back through departed centuries at the history of your face. They have been mighty, only when they were right. Be you just, and fear not-no, not that, for a Percy never feared- be just and triumph. But if thou wilt fight under the banner     60         THE MONARCHST.  of this George III.-and shouldst fall-I tell you that your memory will not be embalmed in story like that of your great namesake who fell gloriously at Shrewsbury. What is life to a  Percy without glory? And what glory can be found battling on I the side of in usurper, who fears to take the field himself? It i was not so with Henry IV." "Pardon me, fair lady; but time flies apace, and I must be i going," said Percy, with marks of impatience, as well as of interest in the animated appearance of Flora. "I cannot stay to discuss those things with you now. Another opportunity may-- "Never occur!" said she, interrupting him. "I feel, in this separation, that we are parting for ever; and if I should ever gaze upon your grave, I will drop a tear upon it, as I recur to this moment 1" "Farewell-all of you!" said Percy, kissing the hands of his fair companions. "Living or dying, until my last gasp, I shall not cease to dwell with gratitude upon the many kindnesses  bestowed upon me during my brief sojourn under your father's roof," said he, to the Misses West; " and you will be pleased to repeat my words to your generous father-and present him my warm adieux. Gentlemen, will you accompany me to the beach, where I see a boat approaching?" "Not I, sir," said Mr. Finny. I am fearful, as it is, that I shall be charged with winking at your escape. I am, however, a civilian." "I will go!" said Robinson. "No!" said Miss Frances, energetically. You might be taken prisoner." "I pledge my faith that no violence shall be offered him," said Percy; and then added, smiling, "he is already a captive, I suspect; and would not choose to be free from his bonds. I would not have him accompany me on board in any other capacity than as a voluntary adherent of the king whose colours are displayed at the mast." "Do not go, Robinson. If he will leave us, let him proceed alone." Repeating his adieux, Percy set off at a moderate pace, and i had gone not exceeding a hundred paces, while the company he had separated from gazed after him in silence, when a voice was heard in the rear. "After him! after him, I say! Robinson Custis and William  Finny, I command you to ride after that young man and bring    TIIE MONARCHST.         61 , him back-or else lend me a horse. Mine has broken his neck in a ditch, confound him!" On turning they beheld the newly appointed Lieutenant Waples approaching briskly on foot, and panting with the exercise. "Robinson, I beg you will do neither!" said Frances. "That is the order I must obey, Sam," said Custis; "I am sorry I cannot accommodate you." "Will you lend me your horse?" continued Waples, ad- dressing Finny. "Deny him," said Flora. "I must first consider the subject," replied Finny, "in a civil point of view, and with due deference to the impromptu opinions of the ladies."  "If you are going to make a speech on it, he will escape," said Waples, in vexation. "Yonder comes Harry Parker; he will catch him!-No! down he goes, into the same cursed ditch! I will chase him on foot!" "I command you to stay!" said Ann Custis. "Command me to stab myself, and I will do it! But I must perform this duty, if possible. Remember the Captain's orders!" saying this, Waples set out on foot, seeing that Percy continued to ride leisurely along. "Go, then!" said Ann; "but bring him back to the Squire's house." She was to spend a month with the Misses West. These words, uttered in a tone to be distinctly heard by Waples, seemed to shake his resolution; and he actually paused, and finally abandoned the pursuit; while a triumphant glance of intelligence was exchanged between the sisters. "Deuce take him! perhaps it will be as well for me to let him go!" muttered he. When Percy arrived at the margin of the water, he 'delibe- ratelv dismounted, and leaving the reins on the neck of the horse, which quickly ran back to the party from which he had departed, he waved a final adieu, and stepped into a boat which quickly conveyed him out of sight round the wooded shore. A -few hours after these occurrences, men might have been seen coursing in every direction. But before any considerable force could be marched to the point of danger, danger itself had ceased to exist. The Mercury retired with the tide, and was seen a few hours after standing across the bay, freighted with luxuries for the Governor's table, and bearing the gallant scion of the great house of Northumberland to his doom. When Mr. Wise returned to his mother's house, she still remaining in the woods with many others, until assured posi- -6      62         THE MONARCHST. tively that every one of the enemy had departed, he evinced less indignation at the havoc that had been committed with the pro- perty, than at beholding the paltry sum of money which had been left on a bureau as'an equivalent. And in point of value, perhaps the amount of rioney was not inadequate; but the idea  of feeding the enemy for pay, was too shocking to be borne I with equanimity; and, acting upon his first impulse, he threw the money into the creek. ,\ ;!!!a   THE MONARCHST.          63 CHAPTER V. Let priests and maidens seek in flight A peaceful shelter from the fight, Or at the altar kneel and pray; For many a blow and many a fright Shall spread the pall of gloomy night Ere beams the dawn of happy day! Yet merry eyes and reckless hearts Perforce must play their mocking parts. EVENTS of the most startling nature followed in quick suc- cession, and no portion of the country escaped the general alarm. On the western shore of Virginia, in particular, both the patriots and the tories were destined to suffer all the horrors of devastat- ing war. At the Great Bridge Colonel Woodford encountered the enemy, and in a severe action, triumphed against the superior discipline of the royalists, and slew their commander, Captain Fordyce. He was soon after joined by Colonel Howe, with four hundred men, from North Carolina, and then marched upon Norfolk, where the tory partisans of the governor were very numerous. These fled from the town, and sought refuge on board the British ships. But Lord Dunmore being joined by Captain Bellew with the frigate Liverpool, and several more companies of regular troops, he collected all his ships of war, and in the winter bombarded Norfolk. The terrible scene of destruction that ensued was evidence sufficient to convince any one that no measure of ad- justment short of submission was likely to be assented to by the British ministry. This was soon followed by a dispersion of the fleet, with orders to slay, burn, and pillage, wherever re- sistance to the King's authority might be manifested. On the other hand, General Charles Lee enjoined it upon Colonel Woodford, who was as much inclined by nature to be mercifull as he was brave and enterprising, to retaliate the ie  verities practised by the British, on the disaffected to the i'ause ' of the colonies. The only hope of escape was to be neutral, l rather to be friendly to both parties by turns; and although tJi2 course was not without its perils, many individuals in the lo' r     "         THE MONARCHST. counties, both from an inclination to avoid taking either side openly, and from motives of cupidity, pursued it.  Every day, and sometimes every hour, something new and ' distressing was reported on the narrow peninsula composed of 4 the counties of Accomac and Northampton. Although one or  two attempts of the British barges to land had been repulsed by ! the boldest of the inhabitants, yet it was not to be concealed i that many of the people were undecided in their sentiments, and that others had frequent communication with the ships of the enemy. Hence there couhk be no assurance that the good people of the eastern shore were to have a prolonged exemption from the evils inflicted on their brethren across the bay. On the contrary, as it became apparent, from the enthusiasm excited by the successes of General Lewis and Colonel Woodford (under whom a number of the eastern shore men were fighting), the forces of the colony were likely soon to acquire a superiority in the field, it was suggested and feared that Lord Dunmore might retire to Accomac and Northampton with his fleet and army,-as a place of security, or point d'appui, from whence he might assail the undefended places on the opposite shore at pleasure, or await the issue of operations in the north, when sufficient succours might be detached from thence to enable him to take the field again. At all events, he -had entire command at sea, and in the bay, and could not be molested in the peninsula., And if the hostile disposition of the people there should provoke his resentment, he would certainly have it in his power to take ample vengeance. For he had only to land his force at the lower end of Maryland and then march to the south, flanked by his ships on the right and left (on the ocean and on the bay), and no individual could escape him. The entire population would be like fish in a seine, which reached from one extremity of the water to the other. It was in the midst of apprehensions of such a calamity as this, that letters were received by Squire West and the widow Custis, from Master Robert Wales, dated at Philadelphia, ad- vising them to remove their families to that city, as a place of security. He intimated that intelligence had been received from some of the spies employed by Congress, which justified the be- lief that the peninsula would, in a certain contigency, be occu- pied by the enemy; and if such should be ther determination, their arrival might be sudden, and premeditated unannounced. He concluded by stating that both Mr Hewitt ahd Mr. MacCos: kie would no doubt accompany them; and, fro: the pao* ' nature of their profession, would be most likely to'rbteot them    THE MONARCHST.          65 from insult or injury, if they should fall in with any of the enemy on the way. Soon after the receipt of Master Robert's letter, the two gen- tlemen of the church visited the neighbourhood of Deep Creek, and announced that when they departed thence it would be to continue their journey up the peninsula, and on to Philadelphia by land, passing through Maryland and Delaware. They added their solicitations to Master Robert's suggestions, and were supported by Mrs. Kingsburgh and her daughter, who were determined to accompany them. The Squire positively refused to leave the estate himself, but left it optionary With his daughters whether to go or remain. They, too, decided promptly to stay; and Frances likewise de- cided that Master Robinson shot:' not go without her. His brother was away, no one knew exactly upon what field, two days together. Now a letter from him described a battle wherein he and Waples were foremost in the fight; and the next week another, from a different place, would mention their retreat before superior forces. But all his letters dwelt upon the glorious sport of the contest, and urged Robinson to lose no time in hastening to the field, and participating in such famous enjoyment. As Miss Frances contrived to see these letters (and what could she not accomplish with one so desperately in love with her), she was by no means sure that the tender heart of her lover might not be ignited by the flame of martial glory as well as by the fires of love. And, fearing that if she went to Philadelphia, she might lose him there, she not only made up her mind to remain where she was, but to lose no time in irrevocably securing her lover. So she decided to marry him at once, and to keep him with her at her father's house. This was accomplished during the stay of the clergymen at Deep Creek. The ceremony was performed at St. James's church, with much pomp, and the festivities that followed would have made an indifferent spectator-suppose that no dread of any impending calamity could find a place among a people apparently so gay and thoughtless. This accomplished, Ann Custis, who affected to be careless of the fate of her lover, decided to accompany the Kingsburghs and the clergymen to Philadelphia. Her cousin Ann, when taking leave of her at the door of the carriage, said, s "You know his last letter speaks of a rumour that he (Waples) may be ordered to march to the north." "If. he goes, my brother will be with him," said Miss Custis, "and I shall meet him there. I have no claim on Waples; but I may restrain my brother." 6*     "         THE MONARCHST.  In due course of time, although the journey was tedious, and not without its alarms, the party arrived safely in Philadelphia, and procured lodgings and board in Second street, with a family  of Quakers, by the name of Darrah.  They were met and heartily welcomed by Master Robert Wales,  who, to their surprise, was richly dressed, in the most costly  materials, and in the height of the mode. He was attended by  Mr. Kingsburgh, who had abandoned the cause of the House of Hanover, as soon as the Declaration of Independence was  promulgated. The meeting of the family was affectionate in the extreme, and the joyful tears of Miss Flora upon embracing her father, greatly moved the sympathy of Miss Custis, who heartily partook of the congratulations on the occasion. At night the whole party visited the theatre, in South street, near to Fourth, in opposition to the kind remonstrances of Mr. and Mrs. Darrah-who were especially shocked to see the re- verend clergymen accompanying them. The young ladies were so greatly pleased at the performances, neither of them having ever been before in a theatre, that all other objects and thoughts were for the present utterly banished from their minds. The first piece was Washington's favourite, "The Poor Soldier ;" and the play was performed in such a manner by Hallam, sup- ported by Messrs. Young, Tomlinson, and Wall, Mrs. Douglas and Miss Wainwright,-that there was scarcely an eye in the house which did not pay its tribute of a tear; and not a heart which did not throb with sincere sympathy for the poor soldier. But the comic powers of Morris-the inimitable Morris-in the afterpiece, diverted the ladies beyond description.  These things, however, seemed to possess no real charms for Hewitt, or MacCoskie, or Mr. Kingsburgh, or Master Robert Wales; and while the ladies were absorbed in the mimic scenes  before them, the gentlemen were entertained in quite a different manner.  "That large man, with such deep furrows in his care-worn face," said Wales, pointing across the house, " was a member of the first Congress: he has since abandoned the cause of America. . But beware of him; his attachment now, for some unexplained reason, to the Hanoverian interest, cannot be shaken. It is  Galloway, the Quaker lawyer. Sitting on his left are Mr. Chew, Mr. Tilghman, and Mr. Shippen. Although the first two have sons in the American army, they remain themselves, at least, in a state of dubiety as to what is to be the grand result. The same may be said of Mr. Allen, Attorney General. And there are the Penns-John and Richard; the fat one is Richard, a   THE MONARCHST.          67 decided royalist, and what is more, he is a good churchman; a bon vivant and a wit. The other day when it was suggested by Mr. Dickinson, the author of "Farmers' Letters," that as the interests of the Penns were so indissolubly connected with those of the state, that they should hang together, and remain insepa- rably identified, Richard remarked that it seemed immaterial to him, whether they should 'hang together or separately.' Further to the left are many of the principal lawyers of the city, Ingersoll, Biddle, Ross, Reed, Bradford, Dallas, Sargeant, &c., in regard to whose sentiments I have yet learned nothing. But yonder comes one of the new generals, Mifflin, whom we will see to-night at Dr. - 's. The only thing certain in regard to him," continued Wales, in a low tone, "is his disapprobation of the applause bestowed upon Washington; and being undeter- mined in his projects for the future, of course he may be moulded and shaped to answer a valuable purpose." "Master Walter," said Flora, interrupting him, "who is that lady sitting next to the large man on our left?" "That is Miss Franks, a great belle." "What beautiful black eyes and hair!" said Ann. "She is a Jewess," continued Wales, "and a bold, ambitious woman," he added, to the gentlemen, "who has both the romance and the intellect to be useful in our cause." "My daughter must become acquainted with her," said King$burgh. "And near to her," continued Wales, to the ladies, "you observe the lady with large open features, and the profusion of hair; she is Mrs. Bache, the daughter of Dr. Franklin, who is now a commissioner at Paris. The younger lady, with the sweet oval face, sitting at her side, is Mrs. Reed, late Miss de Berdt. Her husband is the most talented and most valued of General Washington's aids; but it is said he is soon to become a member of Congress." Nor had our fair company failed to attract the attention of the audience; and the young Pembertons, Binghams, Willings, and others-fine beaux of the day--watched for a favourable opportunity of questioning Master Robert (who seemed not only to know everybody, but to be known by alD concerning them. But there was no such opportunity that evening.     68         THE MONARCHST. CHAPTER   VI.           ' In war and peace, in love and hate, The demon discord sows his seeds; But envy is the barb of fate Which Satan wields for evil deeds. WHTAKER'S HYMNS. AT a late hour of the night Master Robert Wales ushered the two clergyman from Virginia, and Mr. Kingsburgh, into a spacious room at Dr. -  's mansion, where some twenty gen- tlemen, and among them several military officers of high rank, and members of Congress, were already assembled. No intro- ductions took place. It was a rule of that coterie that no names whatever (of any of those present) should be mentioned when not unavoidable. It was sufficient evidence of one's fidelity to find him admitted there, and hence no questions were asked about his antecedents. Men of a certain latitude of ideas met there for purposes of free discussion on the existing condition of things, and the pro- babilities of the future. They were generally dissatisfied with the progress of affairs, and freely interchanged their censures of both men and measures. And although they met thus secretly, no thoughts of any action, which might be deemed treasonable, had once occurred to them.  The object seemed to be to form combinations which might, at certain junctures, be instru- mental in effecting objects more consistent with the interests of the country than those advocated by the party then in the ascendency. But few of the leading men, at that period, either in Congress or in the army, entertained the idea of the erection of a Republic as a succedaneum for the mgnarchical rule to which alone themselves and their ancestors had been hitherto accustomed. The existing government, the tacit confederation, was almost universally regarded as a merely temporary structure. Inefficient in war, even when the country was invaded, and when  it might be supposed there would be a spontaneous union of X purpose and co-operation of action; what was it likely to become  when no such incentives to unanimity should exist? But it was equally clear that matters had gone too far, to admit the  "   THE MONARCHST.          69 slightest hope of reconciliation with the reigning Kin 'of Great Britain. What, then, was to be done? It was to endeavour to find a solution of that question, or to contrive the ways and means of doing it, that those gentlemen met at stated periods in grave consultation. "What does Franklin think of the prospects, now '? asked General Conway. "His last letters," replied a member of Congress, " are rather discouraging. Monsieur de Maurepas has failed in an attempt to induce the Queen to abandon M. de Guisnes; and there is no immediate prospect of France rendering us assistance, not- withstanding their hereditary hatred of the British knows no diminution." "Franklin, himself, is wavering," said Dr. -- . "His letter to me affords an indication that he does not desire to be understood as favouring the perpetuation of the present weak government, or of committing himself at all to any particular form. I infer that he would choose a Prince from the Stuart line, if a proper one could be found." "Charles Edward still lives!" said the member of Congress. "And France has more than once made the Stuarts her instru- ments in striking her blows at England," said General Gates, who had but a few days previously arrived in the city. "Why not do it again, if she is not prepared to espouse our cause openly? If Charles Edward were to land on these shores with a few millions in hard money, and erect his standard on the basis of independ- ence of the House of Hanover; and at a moment of disaster in the field, and despondency in the Congress, it strikes me that a formidable host would soon rally round him." "But what has the Queen's refusal to abandon Monsieur de Guisnes to do with the part France might act in relation to our affairs?" asked a member of Congress, from Massachusetts. "Guisnes is the Queen's favourite," said Dr. - ; "he in- fluences her, and she controls the King. But, gentlemen," he continued, "I shall suggest to Dr. Franklin in my next letter, the policy of sounding M. de Guisnes on the subject of the Stuarts. Whether that race would be qualified to answer our purpose or not, in furnishing a monarch, still, it would be serving our country if we could but add to the embarrassment of George III. by a demonstration of that kind." "It could do no harm," said General Mifflin. "But before any substantial good can result to the country from any expedient of that nature, we must beat the enemy already in our midst;     70         THE MONARCHST. and for my part, I must confess that I can see no encouraging ; prospect of such a consummation during the present campaign."  "Nor any subsequent one, under our present chief," said 4 General Conway. "The obtuse individual," said General Gates, "who could  hold his watch in his hand fifty-five minutes, merely to ascertain  what quantity of corn his mill would grind in that length of  time, methinks was not the proper one to make our Commander- ; in-chief." "And Washington did that?" asked several. "He did, by Jupiter!" said Gates, "and told it me himself." "And pray how much corn did he say was ground in that length of time?" "Precisely one bushel." His old mill at Mount Vernon was a rickety concern. This produced considerable merriment. "But," continued the General, "the gratifying part of the experiment, as Washington himself admitted, is yet to be told. The bushel of corn yielded five pecks of meal. Heavens! friends! shall we have a miller for our chief? One who can look calmly on his dial and see the precious minutes wasted? He will neither fight himself, nor let his generals do battle. At Long Island, if the attack had been renewed, we should have been victorious; but for fear of losing some of his men, he precipitately withdrew them all out of the way of the enemy!" "Ay!" said Conway, "and lest some of his dear friends might be hurt, he gave up the city of New York, and both forts, Washington and Lee. He should invent some sort, of armour for his men that would be cannon-ball proof." "And what do you think engages most of his attention now?"  continued Gates. "The deuce knows!" replied Conway; "unless it be devising means of saving a sixpence in his own purse by sending a troop of horse, at the public expense, to bring Mrs. W. to his head- quarters. He will have no salary; but his 'family expenses'  will quadruple the pay of any other general in the service."  "Quite likely," continued Gates; "I have it from unquestion- able authority that he and Governor Clinton are about to con-  summate one of the most magnificent speculations ever dreamed of in your philosophy. They have secured, or are about to se- cure, the title to six thousand acres of land, at an inconsiderable price, in the vicinity of the mineral springs at Saratoga. They thought they had the springs themselves, but were mistaken; the title could not be obtained. But they will have enough. I  ..   THE MONARCHST.          71 Clinton is to borrow the money, and Washington to pay half the interest, till the lands increase in value, when they are to sell out and divide the proceeds." "Washington will be a prince in landed estates," said Dr. --. "I learn he has bought the claims of the British officers who served in the west with him, as -well as those who were under Braddock. He got them for the merest trifle, just upon the eve of the present war, when they were in danger of being confiscated. If we maintain our independence, of course Wash- ington instantly becomes a very Croesus. So you see he fights (if his retrograde campaigns can be called fighting) for something." "We are becoming much annoyed at his letters," said a mem- ber of Congress, from Connecticut; "and they are as numerous as the Egyptian vermin. Lamentations and reproaches! He has had us ruined a hundred times; I am sure a hundred things have come to pass, each of which he predicted would prove fatal to the cause. And yet, for all the men and money we have sent him, what has he sent us in return but disasters? I do not doubt, gentlemen, General Washington's personal honour, or fidelity to the cause; but I cannot close my eyes to a conviction of his incapacity. He was already rich, and had acquired some fame in fighting the Indians; hence he offers his character, and his great stake in the contest, as a guarantee of his good inten- tions, and the exercise of his utmost powers. These considera- tions induce a majority in Congress still to adhere to him." "Besides, it is well known to certain individuals that he feels a personal animosity against the King, because Captain Howe was made a lord for capturing a French ship with 8000 on board, while he did not receive the' slightest perceptible notice from his gracious Majesty," added another member. "But what is his purpose, in the event of final triumph?" asked one. "No one knows, I believe," said Dr. --; " nay, not even himself, I presume. That he will never listen to overtures for reconciliation with the house of Hanover, I feel well convinced. He could never be secure in his vast possessions, if even his per- son escaped, after the many irrevocable steps he has taken. But I have often heard him express his opinion that the present sys- tem of government was decidedly too weak and inefficient. I think, notwithstanding his great attachment to agricultural pursuits, so often expressed, if it were tendered him with any degree of unanimity, he might probably be induced to accept a crown."' This produced many smiles.     72         THE MONARCHST. "And I, for one, and I think most others of the profession,"  said the reverend Mr. Duch, " would rather see Washington a  king, than have erected a democratical government, in which all - the leaders would be tyrants." "But who dreams of a democracy?" asked Mr. Kingsburgh.  "Mr. Jefferson, Mr. Henry, and Mr. Paine," said Master ; Robert Wales. "And you should be able to speak advisedly as it regards one of them," remarked a member of Congress, " as it is understood you sometimes act in the capacity of Mr. Jefferson's amanu- ensis." "I do speak advisedly," continued Wales; " and Mr. Jefferson would not only have a republic here, but in France, and in every country upon the face of the earth. He and Paine have sworn to wage an indiscriminate and never-ending war against all kings." "A contest with wind-mills!" said Mr. Hewitt. "But Jefferson is no Don Quixote," said Dr. - ; "and his 'influence, whatever direction it takes, will be effective, if not suc- cessfully combated." "Gentlemen," said Mr. Kingsburgh, " from what I have this night heard, it would seem that if the royal standard of the house of Stuart were erected on this soil, and sustained by the legiti- mate heir to the throne in person, there would not be wanting adherents to the cause. I have, then, to inform you that there is now a letter in this city from the Count d'Albany (the veritable Charles Edward), proposing to embark for this continent, when so advised by a sufficient number of the leading characters of America, whose opinions of the public sentiment, and whose in. fluence with the people, in his behalf, may be relied upon. He still has the crown jewels of his grandfather, and upon which he could doubtless procure a tlrge sum of money. He wrote from Italy. And in a postscript he says he had just been summoned to Paris, by the first minister of Louis XVI., and that the de- sign of the French court can be no other than to encourage and facilitate such an enterprise. But be the result of that confer- ence what it may, he repeats that it is his intention to embark at Leghorn, as soon as sufficiently encouraged to do so from this side of the Atlantic." This speech produced a great sensation. They might have : doubted the correctness of the intelligence, had it not been an invariable rule to be absolutely sure of the trustworthiness and veracity of every individual admitted to their council-chamber. Of course this information superseded the necessity of writing to Dr. Franklin on the subject; and it was agreed that individuals   THE MONARCHST.          73 not then present, as well as others not in the habit of participat- ing in their deliberations-and among them, even Washington himself-should be sounded on the subject, before any formal reply be sent to the Count. A sound of horses' hoofs in the street attracted attention. A few minutes afterwards a member of Congress entered, and an- nounced that President Hancock had just received important letters by the express from head-quarters. The substance of Washington's communications was, he said, that the most of his troops were determined to return home at the approaching expi- ration of their enlistments; that others, although the time had long since passed for them to make their appearance in the field, still remained away; and the consequence was that there seemed to be every reason to apprehend the army would be dissolved or reduced to a few thousand inexperienced and unreliable recruits. Besides, as the enemy were always fully advised of our condition and prospects, it was to be feared they might occupy New Jersey, and perhaps make a dash at Philadelphia itself. During the silence which succeeded the above announcement, another individual entered, whose appearance at once riveted the attention of every one present. This was a tall, pale, gaunt offi- cer, with a contemptuous sneer upon his thin, closed lips. His large wild blue eyes were surmounted by a high forehead; his brown hair was mixed with gray; his nose Roman, but too long, and too much curved, to be handsome, and seemed to control the form of his entire face, which, in profile, at least, corresponded with it in shape. His neck was unusually long, but his shoulders were square, and his gait and carriage proud and erect. It was Major General Charles Lee. There was a general movement throughout the room upon his entrance and when he reached the centre of the chamber, and remained standing, there was a circle round him, awaiting an explanation of his unexpected return from the south. "I am here, gentlemen, as much contrary to my own expecta- tions, as to yours. Our Chief does not spare his officers, if he will not suffer the men to fight. I am first ordered on a wild- goose chase to Virginia to superintend the desultory skirmishes in a predatory warfare, without an army and with no systema- tized dispositions. But no sooner is order begun to be produced out of confusion, than I am ordered back to the Hudson, to see the flag of the foe waving over the fort bearing my name. It is true, Fort Washington is in the same predicament; and that might be some consolation, if they had fallen as a consequence of inevitable necessity. But what is to be the nex t disaster-? 7     74         THE MONARCHST. Shall we retire before General Howe, and bow him, as the worthy representative of his Majesty, into this city? Oh! it is humili-  ating to an officer who has been accustomed to strike home, to see so many glorious opportunities escape! I shall not endure  it! I will say to Washington, Sir, give me a detachment, and let me act according to circumstances on my own responsibility, or else let me return to the south, or go to the lakes, anywhere, so that I may neither behold, nor participate in the shameful re- treats always occurring in your presence. My opinion, gentle- men, is that the British army will spend the winter in this city, if Washington faces their van. I he were to ,leave the way open in front, and threaten their rear, or menace their flanks, they would never venture to march through New Jersey." "If Howe should possess this city, and at the same time hold New York, while Washington is without an army, our cause will be ruined!" said a member of Congress. "And we shall all be hung," remarked Conway; "whether separately or together, as Richard Penn says, cannot be very material." "General, you have once escaped from as desperate a cause as this. You were with Charles Edward at the battle of Culloden," said Kingsburgh, who had recognised him. "Perhaps the dis. aster of that day is destined to be avenged upon the plains of America." "I could hope so," replied Conway. "If we were fighting with some better defined object in view than we have at present, there would be a more determined spirit evinced. Should the Prince come over, he would undoubtedly be followed by many Jacobite nobles from home. I learn that Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, and many other powerful Lords, are still true to the legitimate heir." "In this contest," said Lee, "we have neither present pay nor prospect of future reward. Washington, alone, can afford to labour pro bono publico. There is but one desirable position in the prospect, and he of course will have it. He, alone, might expect to be the modern Cinoinnatus, and live in history as the saviour of his country, and the founder of the mighty republic.  All the rest would be mere P4wns. No Kings, Knights, or even  Castles! Methinks, under the shadow of his broad magnanimity,  there lies concealed a huge amount of selfishness!" Thus their indeterminate deliberations were prolonged until nearly morning, when they separated in gloom, each one bearing with him a conviction that the sword alone could solve the great problem of the future.

Cannons booming, sabres clashing, Thunders rolling, lightnings flashing- But busy thoughts of giant mind Shall guide the storm and rule mankind. FOR many weeks succeeding the events referred to in the last chapter, such a succession of alarming reports proceeded from the east, that at length the inhabitants of Philadelphia seemed to become accustomed to them; and as they saw nothing of the enemy, many of them began to doubt if there was in reality any immediate danger of being molested in the city. Hence the gayeties and pleasures of the opulent and fashionable citizens and strangers were enjoyed as usual. Friend Darrah, the schoolmaster, with whose wife the party of ladies from Virginia boarded, strove assiduously to make the time of the guests pass as lightly as possible. His hours of leisure were cheerfully devoted to their service, and they were shown all the objects of interest in the city and its vicinity. He even extended his complaisance so far as to agree with Kings- burgh that the Stuarts were the legitimate heirs to the throne of England; and that he would be quite contented to see restored to them what was admitted to be rightfully their own. But he had heard that the young Pretender was sadly degenerated in his morals, like some of the descendants of William Penn; and before he wore the crown, he said he should be required to leave off drinking and gaming, and likewise abjure the abominable absurdities of the Romish church. Kingsburgh, himself, had become somewhat addicted to the bottle since his residence in the city, very much to the chagrin of his wife and daughter. But he declared it was the result of grief and anxiety. Hence it was that he defended his Prince on the score of such trivial peccadilloes with a vehemence and pertinacity which, if they did not convince Friend Darrah of the necessity of such habits, at least they could not fail to excite his     76         TIHE MONARChIST. pity both for the misfortunes of the one and the failings of the other.  It was in the midst of a disputation of this nature one day, that a note was brought in for Mrs. Kingsburghh; she was ab- sent, and it was handed to her lord, who iappened to be at the  time somewhat stimulated by recent potations. When he cast - his eyes upon the superscription, and recognised the handwriting,  he fell into such extravagant excesses of excitement, that Friend  Darrah stared at him in bewildered astonishment. "Why, Donald, what ails thee-? Has thee been informed of some great fortune coming to thee by that letter? No; thee has not read it, yet. Thy face is flushed one minute, and pale the next. Perhaps thee is sick." Now, although Kingsburgh was at least fifty, and his hair was quite gray, the only reply he gave was to kiss the letter in his hand, and then, in the absence of music, to dance a jig! "Thee must be going crazy!" said Darrah, " and I must leave thee to thyself." "No!" exclaimed Kingsburgh, now holding the frightened Quaker firmly by the arm. "Let us be quiet. Mrs. Darrah must not hear us, she is not to be trusted." "Lydia not be trusted? Lydia must not hear us? Why thee is mad, stark mad, verily! How can she help hearing thee?" Kingsburgh had begun to hum a Jacobite song. "Friend Darrah, I have such great news that it almost turns my wits. Swear you will not mention it to any one." "Donald, I do not know what I could mention, beside thy antics, and the receipt of a letter which I know nothing about, and which I see thee has not yet read. But I will not swear. I will say to thee, though, that I may be trusted." "I will not break the seal. Flory would never forgive me. But you shall know the contents some time or other." "When thee pleases, Donald." When the ladies returned, and the letter had been read, Mrs. Kingsburgh and Flora were the subjects of almost as great a fit of excitement as had overcome poor Donald. But they were in their chamber, and made no boisterous exhibition of their joy. General Conway, the clergymen, and Master Robert Wales, were immediately sent for. Kingsburgh was despatched on the  errand to the Slate-roof House, the old mansi6n of the Penns, where they lodged. But he could not resist an inclination to celebrate the event he so much rejoiced in, by a glass of rum; and so he diverged from the direct route, and paused for a moment at the bar of the Cross-Keys, in Chestnut street, above Third.  X^   THE MONARCHST.          " Here, although it was quite impossible for him to conceal the happiness he felt, he had sufficient command over his actions and speech to pay the'price of the rum, and depart without uttering anything that might give a clue to his secret. The letter was from Charles Edward Stuart, or rather the Count of Albany, as he signed himself. He had' arrived in- cognito in an Italian brig, which he had chartered, and laden with wine, and had contrived to 'conceal his name and quality from the crew of the vessel. The captain, whom he had placed on board for the purpose of conducting him hither, was the only individual in the vessel who knew him. He was an aged and experienced navigator, the identical Captain Walsh who com- manded the Doutelle which had thirty years before conveyed the same Pretender from France to Scotland. For that service he had been made Count Walsh by the Pretender's father, then living. But as he was a refugee Irishman, and no considerable profit accompanied the title, he subsequently dropped it, and resumed his original seafaring life, sometimes in the capacity of merchantman in the West India trade, and at others as a privateer; but always maintaining a correspondence with the Pretender. He was a fit companion for Charles Edward in many respects. He could drink with him glass for glass, and was equally as fond of gaming. In truth, by fair means or foul, he had, during the passage out, won from his employer the entire cargo of wines. Previously to embarking, Charles had made a secret journey to Paris, in accordance with the intimation contained in a letter written: from his Villa Abaho to Mrs. Kingsburgh. The prime minister of Louis XVI. had, as it appeared, unprompted by the King, conceived the idea of getting up' another rebellion in England, which, if not sufficiently successful to place upon the throne a more profitable ally than France found in the person of George III., it would at least be a diversion in favour of the Americans, who were already making a rapid progress in the affections of Frenchmen and of the court, and might ultimately enable his Christian Majesty to recover Canada. When Charles Edward arrived in Paris, he notified the King -of his presence, and hoped to be sent for and recognised as King of Great Britain. But such was not to be his good for. tune. The court was not prepared to take such a step, particu. larly while the ambassador of George III. was present, and an ostensible peace existed. He was informed that it was necessary for him to remain incognito, and that he could not be permitted 7*     78         THE MONARCIIIST. to have an audience of his Majesty. But, at the same time, an appointment was made for him to meet M. de Guisnes at the  Hotel de Ville, at ten o'clock in the evening.       At the hour specified M. de Guisnes, attended by several ! members of the cabinet, were in attendance. But hour after  hour passed, and no Charles Edward came. At length, and  when upon the eve of separating, they heard the-wheels of a 5- common cabriolet in the court, and the next moment (it was  then one o'clock) Charles Edward himself appeared, but in such a beastly state of inebriation that he was promptly told that nothing could or would be done for him; and he was advised to leave the city, and the kingdom, without delay. He did so, and at once embarked on the New World, which name had been bestowed on the vessel that was to bear him and his fortunes. General Conway, being constituted Master of Ceremonies by the few Jacobites in the city who were aware of the presence of the illustrious stranger on board the brig lyingat anchor in the river, and knowing the habits of the Pretender, enjoined inviolable secrecy on Kingsburgh, and all others who might be liable to make a premature announcement of the presence of the legitimate heir to the throne then occupied by George III., and, as a matter of course, the true sovereign of America. It was a novel experiment; and the General was inclined to observe due caution in its development. He did not know how  far he might be compromised in proposing a monarchical head for a people who had declared, through their representatives, that they threw off all allegiance to the British crown. The Stuarts could assert no title to sovereignty but through that crown. Hence Conway determined to act discreetly, and not to commit himself so'far as to cut off the possibility of retreat, in the event of a failure. The King, as Captain Walsh, who conferred with the Jacobites, termed him, being somewhat indisposed, it was arranged that the party should not wait upon him till the next morning at 10  o'clock. They were to avoid observation by passing in small groups through different streets, to the place of rendezvous, where ! a barge would be in waiting to conduct them on board. It seemed that no entreaties could induce Charles Edward, who, by a sudden whim, now called himself Mr. Douglas, and  had been known by that name alone to the crew, to enter the city. He declared that unless the people generally desired him to reign, and manifested their wish in such a manner as to admit of no doubt of their attachment to his person and fidelity to his   THE MONARCHST.          79 cause, he would immediately return to Italy and await the course of events. He said his adherents in Great Britain, whom he represented' to be exceedingly numerous and powerful, were ignorant of his voyage, and would be greatly concerned to learn of his absence from Europe. But if nothing was to be accom- plished in America, he could return before the alarm at his disap- pearance should become general. And then he could say, if any one reported he had been to America, that he had never put his foot upon its soil. There may have been other motives for the desire to have his voyage concealed, in the event of a failure. The reward of 30,000 offered by the government for his apprehension after his attempt in 1745 to possess the crown, might still be claimed by any one capturing him. And if it were known he had landed in the country, doubtless the British officers would make every exertion to seize his person. On the other hand, the party of democrats springing up in the country, might, to evince their detestation of kings, place him in durance, from whence he could not escape. Then to avoid Scylla on one side and Charybdis on the other (a figure much used at the time by Washington), he had resolved to conceal his quality for the present, from all but the favoured few, of whose fidelity he could not entertain a doubt. In the mean time the hours to elapse before an audience could be had with the legitimate representative of the once illustrious race of Stuarts, were not to be lost by those who felt an interest in the projected movement. The three clergymen, as well as General Conway and Master Robert Wales, were, to sound all with whom they might hold any conversation, on the subject of substituting a Stuart for King George. But they were not to intimate that the one referred to was then absolutely in the vicinity. Mr. Kingsburgh, to the inconceivable alarm of his family, had grown almost wild with joyous anticipations and-- rum. Friend Darrah could not repress his conviction that the man was de- mented, or rapidly becoming so; and so he plied him with many kind words, and would have administered some medicine to him-but he would swallow only spirits. The ladies themselves were busily engaged in preparing their richest dresses and finest ornaments for the important occasion. But their agreeable employment was to be interrupted in a man- ner they could not have anticipated. About an hour after tea, who should be announced but Mr. Thomas Custis and Mr. Samuel Waples '     80         THE MONARCHST. Ann did not, as she declared, desire to see the latter; and  probably would not have entered the parlour, had she not been  urged to it by Flora, who accompanied her. Flora, aware that I a matrimonial engagement had existed between her and the last-  named young gentleman, would not have a contract of such vast  importance ruptured by a mere caprice.  "Well, gentlemen, we are met again, although battles have  been fought, and hundreds slain!" said Flora. "And I give - you joy that you have happily escaped."  Ann embraced her brother, without at first seeming to notice Waples. "I fear we are not to be congratulated by all," said Waples, taking the cold, silently-tendered hand of Ann. "You are mistaken, sir," said Ann, gravely. "I am really rejoiced to perceive you have escaped the enemy's bullets hitherto; and I shall be equally pleased hereafter to learn you have escaped the halter." "That is a cruel, unfeeling, unlady-like speech!" cried the impetuous Waples, turning abruptly, and pacing the room in anger. Custis could not restrain his merriment, and gave vent to an excessive fit of laughter. "Why, man," said he, "I thought it was a very charitable speech." "And I, too," said Flora. "You may criticise it with the utmost care, and I dare to say there will not be found in it a word that will admit of the construction you have seen proper to place upon it. "But the manner in which it was said-the cold looks-the -the-Come, Tom, let us depart! Your sister don't give us . the right sort of a welcome."  "Without one word of adieu?" said Ann, almost, but not quite, smiling.  Waples turned quickly, and long regarded her in silence; but i j her features remained immovable. "Ann," said he, "what did you mean by that?" "What did I mean? Ha! ha! ha! Cannot you understand  the simplest English? What would you have me say?"  "Tell me you have forgiven my conduct in regard to that sprig 1 of nobility, Percy; that you patriotically approve of my march- i ing to the defence of my country, and that you applaud my con-  duct in the field." "I have not heard what was your conduct in the field of bat- tle. Methinks I should have heard of it, if it had been any- thing extraordinary. And as to going to the defence of your    THE MONARCIIIST.    .  ountry, did you not leave us defenceless at home, at a time too then danger was most to be apprehended?" "Sarcastic and unmerciful! I will not speak of my conduct n the several engagements in Virginia. But I can assure you he eastern shore was in no danger. Lord Dunmore thought we vere all loyal, and that it was only in the disaffected districts where subjugation was to be made. Though now I confess there night be some difficulty in returning to Accomac. In a word, Ann-- " the remainder of the sentence was spoken in a whisper. Ann seemed to have made no reply, at least none that was satisfactory; for Waples rose with a vexed countenance. "There is no time to be lost, Tom," said he, "kiss your sis- ter, and let us depart." "Will you not bid us farewell?" repeated Ann, with an equi- vocal expression. Again Waples turned, and hesitated; and again Flora and Custis smiled. "How obtuse!" said Flora. "Obtuse?" said Waples, placing his hand on his forehead. 'How can I place any other interpretation on such an interview as this, than that I am in disgrace for some offence I have un- wittingly committed?" "Unwittingly committed! Did you not deliberately and wil- fully disregard my requests?" "I thought so, Waples! Percy has played the mischief with is all. Miss Luker, who was at first as zealous a patriot as Washington himself, has taken offence because I would have that young Englishman retained as a prisoner. And poor Finny, too, supposes he could get no smile of encouragement from Miss Flora, because of the superior pretensions of this same Percy." "So be it, then!" exclaimed Waples. "If Percy be the obstacle in our way, let him beware when we meet!" "I charge you seek not his life!" said Flora. "He has uttered no word, performed no action, which should rouse your deadly enmity. Beware, that you do not spill the blood of an inoffending brother mortal!" "And I, too, declare," said Ann, "that I have never heard him utter a word that should rouse your ill-will. He is gentle, brave, and noble!" "Is he not one of the enemies of the country? Has not his brother slain hundreds of our countrymen in Massachusetts, on Long Island, and at other places? Are they not both at this     82         THE MONARCHST.  moment engaged in the same cause, and meditating the destruc- I tion of our army?" demanded Waples.  "All this may be true," said Ann, "but young Percy was , my uncle's guest, and my friend, which should have rendered  his person sacred from your hands. But the boon I craved-was X denied me. Hence my just anger at your conduct. You like. X wise disregarded my wishes when you resolved to join the army. : But I had no right to interpose. Still I thought you would con.  sult me. It was otherwise. I do not reproach you. You are your own master, and H-I am my own mistress!" "That's plain talk!" said Custis. "And my brother Robin- son, I suppose, is now not his own master, and Fanny is not her own mistress. Being slaves to each other, they are both free, and doubtless very happy!" "I have a letter, brother Thomas, from Miss Luker," said : Ann. "And I suppose she is in a blaze of indignation against me. She has answered no letter of mine since I have been a soldier. I have no curiosity to know what she says concerning me. I suppose she is well?" "Oh, quite well, and very gay. I presume you have heard of her sister's wedding. Sally is now Mrs. Wise. She danced the whole night, and describes her dashing beaux. Most of them wore swords and sashes, being officers of the home regiment. She does not mention you at all."  "This Percy has played the deuce with us all!" said Waples;  and yet none of them will get him!" "By seeking to destroy him," said Flora, with great anima-  tion, "you will not be meriting a return of the favour of your i offended mistresses. And, after all, should peace return, and he  escape unhurt, he would not, even then, I am quite sure, be an object of hatred, or an obstacle in your way. But who knows  how soon you may be fighting under the same flag, the flag of i: your true sovereign?"  "The true sovereign now is the Congress," said Custis.  "No!" continued Flora, "nor is George III." "Then who is?" asked Waples.  "Charles III."                     "What! the Pretender?" exclaimed Custis. "Is he coming from Italy? If Washington fights for him, we will do so too- if not, not." "We will know more concerning him shortly. But pause, in the mean time, before you sacrifice everything in an issue which may not be the true one."  1\ ,   THE MONARCHST.           83 "I believe everything we care about is pretty well sacrificed already," said Waples, "but our swords, which we are deter- mined shall do good service before we yield them. Might I ask Miss Ann what is her opinion in relation to any pretensions that may be set up in favour of the Pretender ?" "y I shall express no opinion, now, since hitherto it has failed to have any weight." "I Methinks she might utter her sentiments on this occasion," said Flora; " and be the first to add a bold' heart to the new and rightful .causc." Ann shook her head in doubt. "If," continued Flora, "all should thus hesitate, it would be a sad prospect indeed !" "We must away!" said Custis, rising.   "We go to head- quarters to offer Washington our services. Whatever may be the events hinted at, when they are developed it will be time enough for us to consider which course it will be our duty to pursue. If we follow Washington, we cannot go wrong. Fare- well, sister; farewell both," said he, kissing their hands. Waples did the same, without uttering a word. When passing through the hall where Friend Darrah was endeavouring to reduce the exhilarated Kingsburgh to a state of composure, they were star- tled upon hearing Donald singing a Jacobite song. "That might be treason elsewhere," said Waples. "But here," replied Custis, "everything offensive to George III. must be good service." The young men mounted their horses, which had been left standing in the street, and rode down to the ferry, where they not only crossed, without further delay, but pursued their journey many miles that night. At the house of Dr. -     there was a very full attendance that evening. General Lee, however, was not present. He had been hastily called away by the commander-in-chief, to watch the threatening movements of the enemy, on the Hudson; and, ac- cording to his desire, he had been accommodated with a separate command. The three clergymen were present, and announced the arrival in the country of one authorized to represent the interest of the house of Stuart. Various were the opinions expressed on the occasion, and many doubts were expressed as to the practicability of the plan of a restoration in the colonies. There was no difference of opinion as to the justice or necessity of a firm and determined opposition to the armies of King George. And there was no individual in the country who more sincerely desired the success      84        ,THE MONARCIIST. of Washington than Dr. --, at whose house the meeting was held. But from the representations of experienced officers, and the result of recent operations, he, in common with a vast num- ber of virtuous and intelligent men, became convinced that the commander-in-chief was inadequate to the discharge of the high and multifarious duties devolved upon him. Others, impelled by other motives, who met there, made no secret of their senti- ments in any company where they happened to fall in with any of their friends. There were individuals who, with an undis- guised jealousy of the confidence reposed by Congress in their chief agent in the field, conceiving him, as they did, to be un- worthy of such unlimited trust, had, in addition, permitted them- selves to entertain an aversion for his character, and embraced every opportunity to injure him in the estimation of the country. But many of the most enthusiastic admirers of Washington, and the most uncompromising opponents of the pretensions of the mother country, were by no means prepared to condemn a limited monarchy. The idea of a republic had not then exten- sively taken root in the minds of the people. The absorbing topic of consideration was self-preservation. Arrangements for the structure of a political edifice which should subserve the in. terests of posterity, were matters of too speculative a character to be entered into by many, at a time when their very existence was threatened by the most formidable dangers. A very large proportion of the inhabitants throughout the states, and particu- larly in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, according to the letters of Washington himself, were quite undecided whether resistance to the demands of the King should be longer maintained. And it was believed by many of the most enlightened statesmen of that day, as well as by many intelligent individuals since, that if, at the period alluded to, the British armies had been with- drawn to Canada, and the demands of Congress had been granted by the commissioners then in New York, that an accommodation would have been consummated, by which we should have re- mained an integral portion of the British empire. Whether or not such a-reconciliation would have proved equally as advantageous to that portion of the race separated by the broad Atlantic from the parent country, as the alternative which happened, in the opinion of divers astute statesmen, must still remain to be solved by the great events yet in the womb of the future, and can form no profitable subject for the pen on the present occasion. Yet as no expedient was to be neglected which might by any possibility serve to extricate the country from the pall of gloom which hung frightfully over it, there was scarcely an objection   THE MONARCHST.          85 raised in the company present, to the trial of the experiment which the pious clergyman, and the sanguine old Jacobite General, so zealously urged. And if Charles Edward had been some twenty years younger, and had landed with a moderate amount of money and arms at that particular crisis, with no stain upon his character, and no bigotry in his religion, the probability of his success would have at least justified the attempt. Such were the opinions expressed at the time; and but little more was done than to express them. A listlessness, an in- certitude, pervaded their counsels. The subject was, however, postponed for future consideration, and the parties apparently most immediately interested were left to act at discretion. The fact that Charles Edward himself was then in the vicinity, was not, by his own request, on any account to be made known at that time to the meeting. Master Robert Wales, who had been a silent spectator of their ineffective deliberations, withdrew early, and repaired to the lodgings of Mr. Jefferson, at the State Ho Inn, in Chestnut street, between Fifth and Sixth streets, kept by Mr. Hassel, whose beautiful daughter Norah, had turned the he s of half the mem- bers of Congress. Wales had no difficulty n obtaining admit- tance. He had on more than one occasion acted in the capacity of Mr. Jefferson's amanuensis, and had been of service to him in facilitating his references to historical dates and facts, by means of his extensive reading and tenacious memory. Mr. Jefferson was alone. He had just risen from the table in the centre of the room, where he had been writing, and was pacing to and fro, with traces of deep thought, and marks of the excitement of recent composition, on his brow. He was six feet and two inches in height, and quite slender and straight, but not fragile. His cloud of auburn, or rather slightly red hair, seemingly totally neglected, or recently tumbled in confusion, but partly concealed his massive forehead, supported at the corners with huge bony columns, as if to indicate an intellectual structure of impregnable defences. Hiis eyes seemed to emit rays of inappreciable intelligence; while his nose, mouth, and chin, defying classification after any model, were in exact conformation to his peculiar powers and character. There was nothing either beautiful or repulsive in his features; although extraordinary, and almost indescribable, they were not irregular, nor uninteresting when animated, which was very often the case, by the mighty spirit within. He was, at that time, about thirty- six years of age. 8     86         THE MONARCHST. It was not easy for the subtle Master Robert, to confront that great man without experiencing an awe he had -never felt even in the presence of princes; and as the statesman pursued his meditation, without having done more than to bestow a hasty nod on his diminutive visiter, Wales glided silently to a chair at a respectful distance from the fire, and awaited patiently the termination of the reflections which so wholly absorbed the mind of his republican friend. The exits of nine hundred in a thousand of mankind are like pebbles thrown into the sea. They sink without a sound or a ripple, and are thought of no more for ever. Others, of more than ordinary magnitude, swell the waters along the shore of time, and their circles are marked for a few years by the waves their weight and impetus leave behind them. But Jefferson was one of the extremely few, whose gigantic powers produce such a commotion of the -elements, that many generations, and perhaps centuries, may elapse, before their influence is destroyed or lost to the world. When such men arise, it must be for some wise purpose. If good is to redound from the doctrines dissemi- nated, the wisdom and beneficence of the Creator cannot be denied; if the contrary shall appear when the period for testing the experiment has been fulfilled, still they must be acknow- ledged, for mankind will no longer, and never again, perhaps, pursue the evil path they were once vainly induced to follow. It was with a full appreciation of the greatness of his intellect, that Jefferson was sought after by Wales. Convinced, from the history of the past, as well as from divine revelation, that a monarchy was the only form of government which promised permanency to the liberties of an intelligent people, dispensed honours and rewards to the meritorious, and protected the weak and defenceless against the caprices of fortune, Wales had determined, insignificant as he was in his physical development, to counteract as effectually as possible, and by any means in his power, the designs of the great apostle of Democracy. The great man, after a few more energetic turns, during which he seemed to have pursued some important train of thought to a successful conclusion, paused and sat down directly beside his visiter, with a pleasant smile illuminating his face. "Master Robert," said he, "what is stirring without?" "Men's thoughts are very busy, sir." "And their tongues, no doubt?" "True, sir. And there is no conversation held anywhere five minutes at a time, wherein the name of the author of the De- claration of Independence is not mentioned."   THE MONARCHST.          87 "Come, Bob, no more of that!" said Jefferson, in a slightly grave tone. "If you desire to learn the secrets of my breast, it is not necessary to resort to any species of flattery. My thoughts are for the world. It is the greatest relief imaginable for me to give them vent. I do it in my speeches and with my pen. We no longer breathe in a country where we dare not utter our opinions. If Washington succeeds, he will be the first man while he lives. But at the foundation of all his greatness, and as the chief corner-stone of the political fabric, must for ever remain the achievement of my pen. I need not be assured of this. I know it. Washington, while labouring for the country, and for his own fame, is working also for me. But why should men speak of me now? It is not true, I fear, Master Robert Wales. They will do it hereafter, if, as I say, they build upon my foundation. If we falter, fail, I shall be forgotten, or re- membered only to be execrated. What is it you wish to com- municate, or to learn from me?" "Some of the people, sir, are expressing a desire to have one of the Princes of the House of Stuart sent for!" "Which one of them? There are but two of the family re- maining. One, the Duke of York, is a cardinal, and can pro- mise no successors; the other, equally hopeless as to posterity, is prematurely decrepit, and abominably dissolute in his morals and habits. What could either of them do here, among men of mind and energy? A'new era is dawning upon mankind; the Republican era." "Nothing, sir, but with their aid and assistance. Our greatest statesmen would necessarily have to govern for him." "But would they be his ministers?  Those who might be so fortunate as to please some royal favourite, or some favoured mistress! Who selects the ministers of George III.? Lord Bute, his minion. In France it is generally a concubine or a priest. Ridiculous!" "And does not history show," said Wales, with boldness, for he had learned from experience that knowledge of facts, and vigorous ratiocination, always dispelled, in the eyes of the statesman, the consciousness of his corporeal insignificance, and even the difference of their relative positions, "that a multitude of electors are quite as liable to make unjust selections, either for favour or for punishment: but with this difference-with the majority of voters there is no responsibility, and from their deci- sion there can be no appeal." "Very true. Themistocles was banished. But had there been a king of Athens, he might never have reached an enviable     88         THE MONARCHST. eminence at all. Master Robert, I fear my arguments can pro- duce no change in you; nor can you make me a monarchist. The die is cast. We must be either freemen or slaves. If the first, for at least ten generations will exist a democracy, or con- federation of democratical governments; if the last, we must first be subjugated by brute force, which is now, in the nature of things, quite impossible. Such is my opinion. If you have any design, or I will rather say, desire, to communicate my opinions to those among us who think differently, or even to the enemy in the field, I care not. You have my permission to do so. You have been of service to me, and I thank you. I knew there was no identity of principles between us, and that there could be none. I even believed you had been employed as a spy, to-make known my secret thoughts to others; but I expressed them none the less freely for that." "Pardon me, sir," said Wales; "but you do me wrong. No one employs me as a spy. I desire pay from no one. I have not taken wages for acknowledged services, as you can testify. But I will confess that I am a monarchist, and am likely to remain one; and I did hope to counteract, in some small measure, your purpose of propagating democratic sentiments. The pamphlet which recently occupied so much of your attention, and which both Mr. Paine and Mr. Dickinson attempted to answer, was my production. It was the result of conviction. Now, sir, have I not. been candid with you?" "True, you have." "Then, sir, if it be true, as you say, that error is harmless if truth be left free to combat it, I hope I have not incurred your displeasure; and I feel convinced that, should circumstances oc- cur to make my position hazardous, you will not betray me." "No, no; Master Robert!" said Mr. Jefferson, giving him his hand. "Repose confidence in no one else of my political creed, and I will be responsible for your safety, while you remain in our camp. But when you see proper to visit the enemy, of course I cannot be answerable for you." "You have derived information from Major Talmadge," said Wales. "It is true, sir; I pass at pleasure from one camp to the other. But it is not for the purpose of betraying either cause so much as to forward my own projects. The commander-in- chief, I know, esteems 'Culper junior' more highly than any other individual employed to give him intelligence. And while I look beyond the present effects of current events, and see ad- vantages to accrue hereafter to the cause I advocate, I have no scruples in giving both parties such information-always to be   THE MONARCHST.          89 relied on as correct-as may secure me free egress and ingress in passing to and fro at pleasure between them. Now, sir, my life is in your hands." ", It is safe, Master Robert. And as you no doubt are some- times called upon to express an opinion in relation tomiy humble self, I may occasionally desire information in regard to the views and aspirations of others. It can be for no other purpose, you understand, than merely to gratify my curiosity. I have no power, in my civil capacity, to injure or advance the interests of any one." "I can inform you that General Howe-" "Never mind. I did not allude to the British." "I will be at the head-quarters of the American army-or what is called the army-next week." "Well. You are doubtless an ingenious correspondent. You, who could write a pamphlet in answer to one dictated by me, and to which I assisted in replying (you still acting the amanu- ensis), will never want resources. But in regard to this project of putting up a Stuart, if you favour it, do your utmost without fear of molestation from me. My strongest argument in favour of a democracy is its necessity. I believe it to be inevitable. Else how is it to succeed, when so few as yet are its advocates? It must win its own supporters, and in the absence of an aristo- cracy it surely will. Or, if you should finally prefer George III. upon certain conditions-though I confess I have not discovered in you any such design-fear not to do your utmost. Or, if you think one of our American heroes would answer the purpose, strive to put him on a throne, if, as monarchist, you must have some apology for a monarch. Try everything; if anything but my democracy be adopted, it will be proof positive that my plan was not feasible, for its existence must depend upon the will of the majority; and then, of course, I must submit." There was a significant smile accompanying these words, which Wales him- self was at a loss to understand. However, he made no reply, but took his leave a moment after. 8*     90         THE MONARCHST. CHAPTER VIII. No gilded playthings now, Mere names, or sparkling gem: Put steel upon thy brow, But not the diadem. Upon the chieftain's face a frown Forebodes no glory to the crown. FRIEND DARRAH, who was habitually an early riser, paused the next morning in the midst of his ablutions, and uttered the words, "Thee is mad!" as he listened to the song ending with 'The King shall have his own again,' which came from the parlour below, whither Donald Kingsburgh had already repaired, and was amusing himself while the ladies were preparing to set out for the church, where there was to be service at sunrise. "Who does thee say is mad, William?" asked Lydia, who lay awake. "Not thee, Lydia; but the Scotsman. I fear he is too much addicted to drink, which thee knows is sometimes followed by mania-a-potu." "The women, William, act strangely sometimes, too; but they do ndt drink. It is the way of the world; all are not taught alike, and thee must not expect them to behave alike." William proceeded to the parlour, still feeling an anxiety to reduce Kingsburgh to moderation. "Thee is merry this morning, Donald," said he, in return for the condescending bow he received. "As the lark, friend Darrah, when it soars up to a blue sky in the golden sunlight. And have I not cause? I have here a bottle of pure wine direct from the hills of Italy. Come, let us drink the health of one we will see and know by and by, but who must be nameless yet." "No, Donald; at least not before dinner," added Wiliam, who was a little tempted to taste the wine, and would have joined him heartily, but in decent moderation, at the table. "Donald," said he, "I have a liking for thee; thee has brilliant parts, and parts again not quite so good. Now if thee would be governed   THE MONARCHST.          91 by my advice, thee might do well. The people of thy country can always do well, if they will. But thee must give over thy excessive drinking, and not be quite so sprightly-" "Why, friend Darrah?" "I will tell thee. Thee has some knowledge of books, and might assist me in my school, until these stormy times are over. Then I have a situation in view, both for thee and myself, which would make us comfortable for life." "Go on; what do you mean?" "Two new public libraries are to be formed in the city. I have the promise of the superintendence of one of them; thee might secure the other. I know it would suit thee; thy country- men are always seeking easy situations in the public offices, and I infer they have a partiality for such fine places as these. If well conducted, such institutions prosper, and the librarians be- come people of considerable importance." "Friend Darrah," said Kingsburgh, with more gravity than he had yet evinced, "if you could read my thoughts at this mo- ment, you would not feel highly complimented. But I won't express them. No one knows what may happen, and what one may be reduced to; but at this time I assure you my aspirations shoot an arrow's flight above being- a self-important, crabbed, Scotch librarian." Just then the ladies appeared, and Kingsburgh accompanied them to the church in Second street above High. The solemn chant, the deep-toned notes of the organ, and the grave visages of the full-robed ministers at the altar, impressed at least the female portion of the small group of worshippers with awe and veneration. During the service the prayer for King George and the royal family was omitted; but thanksgiving was pronounced for the restoration of His Majesty Charles II. in 1660. And it was observed that the loudest "amen" came from the lips of Donald Kingsburgh. At the conclusion of the prayers the little congregation separated at the gate, and seemed to depart in different directions. But they met again, as had been agreed upon, at the barge which was kept in waiting in Dock creek. When all were assembled at the place appointed, they were rowed out into the river, and approached the brig in silence. Even the clergymen seemed more serious than usual; while the ladies, during the breathless excitement, dropped now and then a tear. Captain Walsh stood on the deck apparently without emotion, and in rather harsh tones directed the ladder to be let down.     92         THE MONARCHST. lie bowed stiffly to each one that stepped on deck, without the slightest indication of the importance of the ceremony about to be performed being visible on his bronzed face. To General Conway; however, who was the last to go on board, he made quite a deferential bow. He then conducted them back to the stairway which descended into the cabin. Charles Edwad stood at the further end of the cabin, beside a table covered with articles of luxury. He was clad in scarlet vel- vet, studded with gold lace and jewels; and on his breast glittered a profusion of orders, badges, &c. His height might have been above the ordinary standard, but his back was curved to such an extent, that it required an effort of the muscles of the neck to enable him to look in a horizontal direction. His hair was concealed by a powdered wig. His face bore evidences of the excesses he habitually indulged in. His eyes were inflamed. His cheeks, though quite smooth and of a delicate texture, were perceptibly bloated, and wore the appearance in every respect of a confirmed inebriate. But he was nearly sober on this occasion, and had a sad smile on his pale lips when the party drew near. General Con- way, Master Robert, and the clergymen, whatever might have been their intention before coming on board, now merely made profound inclinations of their heads, and then remained standing. But the Kingsburghs were not to be restrained. They prostrated themselves at. the feet of the prince, the mother and daughter bestowing many kisses upon his hands, while Donald, grovelling on the floor, bestowed as many on his foot. Ann stood apart, in doubt as to the part she should enact in the strange ceremony. True, she had been instructed, before meeting the prince; but then, she imagined the prince would be quite a different sort of person from the individual before her. "We desire you will rise," said Charles Edward, observing that while Kingsburgh's kisses marred the lustre of his shoe, he was receiving in return on his lips and chin some marks of his Majesty's royal blacking. "We pray you be seated-all of you," he continued, with a slight gesture of his hand, which sparkled with diamonds. Then, turning to Mrs. Kingsburgh again, he said: "But, Flora, where are the roses? the red roses, I mean. I see you have the white ones in your hair, and on your breast; but where are those you wore on your cheeks?" "Gone! your Majesty, for ever gone! Departed like the lustre of your bonnie eye, which beamed so cheerily in the Isle of "              THE MONARCHST.          93 Skye. Oh, the wickedness of the world! to ill-use its sweetest Lord, and truest Prince, as it has done!" "And so we, too, bear the visible marks of time? And why not? It has been thirty years since we parted; since you braved the MacCleods at Vaternish, and saved your sovereign from the hands of his deluded persecutors. And we have not yet reward- ed you. We will not be ungrateful. But who is this? Here we find our own Flora, as we first beheld her!"He then be- stowed a kiss upon the cheek of Flora. "Yes, your Majesty," said Mrs. Kingsburgh, "my daughter is another Flora, in everything-in spirit, and devotion to her rightful Prince, as well as in person and features. A moment ago the red roses were on her cheek; now the lilies are there." She then formally announced the names of all the company pre- sent. Walah having, after gruffly uttering the words "The King," abruptly withdrawn. "Master Robert Wales," said Charles, smiling, "we still re- tain a recollection of your father, and it may be we have seen you before. But you must have been young. Your father and grandfather were even less in height than you are. They both served our house, and no doubt fidelity is hereditary in the family." Master Robert, quite conversant with the etiquette to be ob- served in the presence of royalty, made a low bow, but no other reply. "General Conway," continued Charles, " we are glad to meet you once more, with a sword ready to serve your Prince. After the fatal day at Culloden, you know we had it not in our power to bestow promotions. But we used our influence to have our friends advanced in the armies of France, and we remember that you were included in the service." The General bowed. "But now," continued the feeble, prematurely old man, " a new field opens before us, and higher boons may fall within our grasp. Tell me what is the prospect?" "Pardon me, sir," said the General, "but it is altogether out of my power to say, at this time, with any degree of certainty, what would be the result of your appearance openly in the colo- nies, claiming the allegiance of the people. Everything must depend upon the dispositions of our influential characters." "So we supposed," said Charles, dryly; "and hence we have resolved not to step out of our ship, until we know we are to stand on firm ground. We have no disposition now to be play- ing hide-and-seek in the bogs of this wild country, although     "         THE MONARCHST. there is such a pretty Flora here to accompany us. Where ii this leader of yours? this Washington? Since he hates the lHanoverian so heartily that he will not yield when beaten, why should he not join himself to us? We must have him here." "But, sir, I am sorry I cannot give you any assurance thai he will embrace your cause." "Le diable! If he will not obey his sovereign, he must lose his head, and some one else-yourself, for instance-must be m) general!" "Unhappily, sir," said Conway, "Washington, at this time has all the swords of the country in his own hands." "But we must see him. Where is he? When can he be brought hither?" "He is at present, sir, hard pushed by the enemy, who seen to be determined to make a descent upon this city." "So Walsh informs us. But from the map we have here, the line of march must be across this river. Might we not see him on board during his retreat? Master Robert, what do you say i In this business we suppose you may find employment for your talents." "May it please your Majesty," said Wales, " it is my purpose to set out to-day for the camp; and if your Majesty would see fit to cast anchor in the river some twenty miles above the city, I think I may assure your Majesty that General Washington will come on board." "Be it so, then!" said Charles. "If we are to be your King, and to be crowned in this country, the matter must be consum- mated without any tedious delays, or else we will sail for Europe again, and await the day, which approaches fast, when we shall be restored to all our kingdoms. Then you will of course sub- mit to our mild rule." Charles now put an end to the interview, without once deign- ing to utter a word specially to any other person present. Three or four times, in the space of fifteen minutes, had he turned aside and swallowed deep draughts of spirits; and visible chagrin and disappointment were depicted in the faces of the clergymen. The party returned to the city in quite as taciturn a mood as had marked their approach to the last sinking hope of a royal race; but with different impressions. The two Floras, mother and daughter, had been blind to the palpable blemishes which eclipsed the splendid hopes another Prince with similar preten- sions might have reasonably entertained. Conway at once des- paired of building his fortune on such a feeble foundation. The reverend gentlemen drew no favourable augury for the church   THE MONARCHST.         95 from the sad wreck of princely greatness they had beheld. Even Master Robert was dispirited, but not in despair so long as his talents were brought in requisition. And as for poor Donald, although full of loyalty, he could not avoid the remembrance of an expression of displeasure in the face of Charles when he glanced at his moistened shoe. Ann was only amused. When they entered the city again, they were struck with the sudden confusion that. everywhere reigned, or rather rioted. Many of the people were running in different directions, and a general panic seemed'to have seized upon most of the inhabit- ants. News had arrived by express that the British were at length landed at Amboy, a movement which had been apprehended; and they were then probably on their march toward the city. Thousands were preparing to make a hasty flight. Coaches were before the doors of the opulent citizens, whose families were hastening to leave. The Hamiltons, Binghams, Norrises, Palmers, Peterses, Willings, were all on the move, and of course their example was followed by those who had the means of follow- ing it. Even the Congress had adjourned, to meet again at Baltimore, a place of greater security for the public archives, as well as for the public functionaries. Even Ludwick, the Baker General, as he was called, was preparing to remove his ovens. The old skating party, who had waited impatiently for winter, and hoped it would be a cold one, viz. C. W. Peale, "Joe"Clay- pole, and even the Governor, were forced to "take to" the woods, and forego their accustomed sport. But George, the negro, who had beaten them all, remained in triumph. Even the lawyers fled, including Fisher, Coxe, Sitgreaves, Hopkinson, &c., though some of them shortly after returned, and upon mature reflection resolved to remain. James Read, the Register, and Joseph Cowperthwait, the Sheriff, went off together. And it was laughable to see the short fat broker, George Tyson, puffing and blowing through the Governor's woods, west of the Hospital, into a military cul de sac! But if thousands took to flight, many more thousands remained, and among them Friend Darrah, and his party of guests.. Nor was there any immediate danger, as every one conversant with the history of the time must be aware. Like the two famous friends of antiquity, Orestes and Pylades, but with the fair Iphigenia left to her fate, Lieutenants Custis and Waples paced along the road on their weary horses in quest of the American army. Alas! that army was reduced by the expiration of enlistments, and by desertions, to the meagre hand-     96         THE MONARCHST. ful of some three or four thousand effective men, and was now flying before the victorious British General, who had in the field a well appointed army of some twenty-five thousand! No one on the road was able to tell our travellers where Washington's head-quarters were established. In truth there was no fixed resting-place for the General. In the morning he knew not him- self where he might rest at night. General Howe had issued a proclamation offering pardon to all who would lay down their arms and take the oath of allegiance within sixty days. Many availed themselves of the offer, and among them, Galloway and Allen, who had been members of Congress. Such examples had a most pernicious effect on the wavering, who had at any period favoured the American cause; as well as a baneful influence on those who had not as yet borne any part in the contest, and who now held themselves aloof, and could not be induced either to assist in repelling the invaders, or in furnishing food for their famishing brethren faithfully following the standard of the Com- mander-in-chief in the day of distress and disaster. It was when the young Virginians were riding in the vicinity of Trenton, that they were startled by a sound familiar to their ears. "There!" exclaimed Custis, reining up his steed, "did you hear that? Again! That is the music we are seeking. We will have sport, soon." "There it is again, Tom! Whether British or American cannon, the sounds approach nearer and nearer," said Waples, listening to the booming reports in the distance. "True, Sam," said Custis, "they come this way; but it is no battle, or else we could hear the small arms. We are near enough for that.. But let us spur on and see what it is." A few minutes brought them within sight of Trenton, where they perceived a portion of the American army in the act of crossing over to the Pennsylvania side of the river, while a detachment in the rear kept the van of the British army in check by ovuasional discharges of artillery. Riding to and fro along the margin of the river, as if super- intending in person the passage of the troops, was an officer of superior mien, attended by two aids. He was tall, straight, athletic, and in the prime of manhood, for his age did not exceed five-and-frty. There was an unyielding determination in the expression of his active eye, and on his firm lip; and yet there I might have been detected symptoms of impatience in his gestures, as he occasionally despatched a messenger to the rear, or issued   THE MONARCHST.          97 an order to the officers passing down the embankment to the boats. Although neither Custis nor Waples had seen him for several years, and it was then in a civil capacity, as one of the Burgesses at Williamsburg, they had no difficulty in recognising the Com- mander-in-chief. But Washington, whose mind was absorbed in the important transactions of the instant, had failed to recognise them as they approached. Yet he did not fail to return their frank but respectful salutation. "Gentlemen," said he, "where is your company? To-what regiment do you belong?" "We are just from Virginia, sir," said Custis; "and we come to offer our services in any regiment you may appoint us to." "Under whom did you serve in Virginia? Your names?' Upon receiving answers to these questions Washington's reserve seemed relaxed for a moment, and he pressed the hands of his young recruits with decided symptoms of cordiality, for he was always gratified to see his peculiar countrymen (Virginians) join him in th6 field, and particularly so at times like the present, when doubt and despondency weighed heavily upon the advocates of the cause he was embarked in. "Enough!" said he. "Woodford, Matthews, and Cropper have informed me of your commendable conduct. Remain with me, until we can find a resting-place on the other side," said he, pointing across the river, " and I will see what can be done for you. But do not encourage lofty aspirations. We are over- whelmed with officers, and have nothing but skeleton regiments for them to command. And besides, it seems that every nation upon the face of the earth sends its adventurers to our shores, all of whom expect to be made general officers, or commanders of regiments, at the very least. It is all rank, and no file. We shall be embarrassed to provide commands for them; and I fear we will be entirely unable to pay them." "We seek only the excitement of active service, sir," said- young Custis. "And to retain our horses," said Waples. "We seek not to command, so much as an opportunity to use our swords," continued Gustis, with increasing animation. "We have private reasons for repairing to the scene of danger as well as patriotic ones."        B "Ah, indeed!" said Washington. "'But more of is when we meet at the table to-morrow. You must dine with me*; and you may remain with me till then as voluntary aids." "And we desire to be volunteers altogether," said Waples. 9     98         THE MONARCHST. "We want no pay. We will forage our own horses, and fight at any point you may designate. All we ask is to be permitted to fight, and that, too, at our own expense!" "I thank you-I thank you, brave lads!" said Washington, with emotion. "Oh!" he continued, in a low tone, half aside, "if the same spirit only animated a few thousands of our youth, how soon the tide would turn in favour of our poor country!" The rear-guard and artillery being now embarked, Washing- ton, accompanied by his staff, which had collected round him from different directions, and by the two youthful volunteers, entered the boat which had been reserved for the purpose, and was soon in the midst of his little army, now separated from the pursuing enemy by the Delaware river. If sudden exigencies rarely accelerated the ideas of the delibe- rate Commander-in-chief, on the other hand, his mind was never entirely idle, even when no pressing necessity seemed to demand its immediate attention. His thoughts, always tending to one point, flowed on, like the waters of the gentle river behind him. He had so far, by careful foresight and diligent exertion, suc- ceeded in preserving the remainder of his army for the present. That was accomplished, and past. His next object was to adopt measures effectually, if possible, to prevent the enemy from fol- lowing him into Pennsylvania; and no time was lost in despatch- ing officers and detachments in different directions, to remove the boats in the river to places beyond the reach of the British, and to guard the points where they would be the most likely to attempt a crossing, if provided with a sufficient pontoon train. Washington, though wearied with the operations of the day, during which he had been ten hours on horseback, sent for the two young Virginians at ten o'clock at night, to confer with them in relation to the recent events in his native state. They found him alone, sitting before a comfortable log-fire, in a plain but commodious room of a genteel farm-house. His aids and secretaries had retired to rest, and he had brought up his accounts of receipts and disbursements during the retreat through New Jersey, with his own hand. The ingenuous young men, according to Washington's admis- sion, gave him a more perspicuous narrative of the recent events in the vicinity of the Chesapeake, than he had been able to ob- tain frounis:correspondence with the officers engaged in con- ducting fhem, or from the chief in command, General Lee, himself. Familiar with the young Virginians' habits of thought and expression, Washington knew exactly how to draw forth unre-   THE MONARCHST.          99 served communications from them; and they, aware that the one to whom they related their details was no stranger to their re- spectability in the county from which they came, did not expe- rience the slightest embarrassment in the presence of the man who had so often inspired a sense of awe both tin the breasts of friends and foes. "At Gwynn's Island," said Washington, "they inform me that we lost but one man-and that my friend, Captain Arundel. This, to me, is inconceivable. You were there; can you explain how it occurred?" "Very easily," said Waples, smiling. "We were volunteers under General Lewis, who was sent into the Piankatank to attack his Lordship on the island. But we might as well have let them alone!" continued Waples, in his free and easy way. "For they were dying fast enough with the small-pox. Lord Gosport had already been put under the sand. I think the disease killed two to our one, although we pitched the cannon-balls among them like hail. And when they took to the ships, our batteries served them no better. The one Lord Dunmore was in was riddled. We learned afterwards from a deserter, that a ball went through it, wounding his Lordship with a dozen splinters, and smashing her Ladyship's china. The man said he believed she grieved more for the loss of the latter, than for the sufferings of the former. And yet, perhaps, he did not tell the truth. He had been chastised for his insolence by Captain Foy. But I was to speak of our Cap- tain Arundel. Well, he had invented a mortar, and insisted on trying it at the enemy. All his friends advised him not to\ test it on that occasion; at least they desired him to try it first with a slow-match. But no; he must fire it himself. It made a tre- mendous explosion. Fragments flew over my head, and in every direction but that of the enemy. When the smoke cleared away, we found about half the Captain's body some twenty paces distant from where the mortar had been placed." "And so he was not killed by the enemy?" observed Wash- ington. "No, sir; we lost not a man by the fire of the British; and after all, I was rather disgusted with the scene when we after- wards visited the island. I believe one half the negroes they had with them died there. It was not fighting, sir."  "No!" said Custis, "and I trust I may never witness another such horrible scene!" Washington sighed as he heard the recital of the miseries of the poor deluded negroes. Some thousands of them had been     100         THE MONARCHST. liberated from bondage by the British; and, in less than two years, five-sixths of them had died of small-pox  The young men were dismissed by the General after an inter- view of an hour; but during which time nothing had been said in relation to their position in the army, or what kind -of em- ployment was designed for them. They patiently awaited the determination of Washington, well satisfied that he would not forget them. When alone, Washington took from his pocket a small bible, and read attentively the first lines his eyes chanced to fall upon, as was his usual custom. He seemed to be deeply interested. Others might call it superstition; but his faith was so great, that he attached significance to the passages which first met his eye on such occasions. 'There appeared to be light and hope in the promises he read, and he applied them to his present situation. Long he remained thus, quite alone, and in such quietness that no sound vibrated on the air but the chirp of a cricket at his feet. And of that he was unconscious, so profoundly was he immersed in the prophecies and promises before him. Once he closed Ahd book, and turned his grave and thoughtful face towards the blaze on the hearth, as if dwelling upon the consolations it had afforded him. Again he parted the lids of the volume, and again he was cheered by the encouragement the revelation imparted. He then deposited the book in his pocket, and, looking at his watch, seemed to be startled at the lateness of the hour. "It is the time appointed for General Fermoy's messenger to be here," said he, walking to a window, and gazing out at the descending snow. At that moment a signal was heard at the door, and Washington bade the one, whoever it might be, to enter. It was Master Robert Wales, who, bowing profoundly, placed a sealed letter in the General's hand, and then drew near the fire. "This would be important, if true, and to be implicitly relied upon," said Washington, reading the brief details of the letter. "You may rely upon it," said Wales. "Ha! my lad, how should you know anything about the con- tents of this letter, without signature as it is, too?" "Because I wrote it," said Wales, removing his cap and cloak, which were precisely in accordance with those worn by boys at that season. "Is it possible? Why, Master Robert, I thought you werein Philadelphia; you certainly were, two days ago."   THE MONARCHST.         101 "I was, sir; but a fleet steed, or rather three or four of them, one after another, can transport one of my weight a greater dis- tance, in a brief space of time, than men of greater dimen- sions." "I do not doubt your word, sir," said Washington. "I have never found your intelligence erroneous. But Mr. Mersercan, of Princeton, was to provide a simple youth he was acquainted with to pass the enemy's lines, who was to report to General Fermoy, and whose messenger was to be sent to me at this hour." "I was the ' simple youth,' sir," said Wales, smiling, "and likewise the General's messenger. I changed my clothes, and became another boy, exactly to his taste." "But how could you ascertain so quickly their plans for, per- haps, months to come? In your letter, the autography of which is as well disguised as your person was a few moments ago, it is stated that General Howe is to remain inactive in his present position, with the wings of his army spread out to such an ex- tent that he must take me for a fool, to suppose I will not clip them. Can he suppose I will permit him to remain thus exposed with impunity until the river is frozen over, or until the begin- ning of another campaign?" "General," said Wales,. with the perfect gravity he could assume, both in tone and features, " to serve you advantageously, I must sometimes seem to serve the enemy." "I am aware of it," said Washington, quickly; "and so long as you serve me effectually, I care not what you communicate to the enemy." "The information I am enabled to give you on the present occasion, I repeat, may be relied on. But, as you justly suspect, it was not wholly obtained during the few hours I have recently spent in the camp of the enemy. I may say, without vanity, though it might be something for so diminutive an individual to be vain of, that General Howe's present dispositions are partly the result of my diplomacy. At Philadelphia I had foreseen that you could make no stand until you got the Delaware in your rear; and I lost. no time in making such communications to General Howe, as were designed to produce the result which has since taken place. I need not explain the details. You see the inviting opportunity to clip one of his wings. To test the accu- racy of my statement, and to prove my fidelity to the cause, I propose remaining with you, and witnessing the clippingf opera- tion." 9*     102         TIE MONARCHST. "Very well. But if you knew all this before, why did you find it necessary to go within their lines at all?" "To see with my own eyes, and to be sure they were posted as I desired, before making this communication to you." "I thank you, Master Robert! It is indeed an opportunity to revive the drooping spirits of the country." "In return, I have a request to make :-There is a brig lying a few miles below, having on board an important individual whom I would have you see. The interview may be fraught with happy consequences both to yourself and to the country. The vessel is near the Pennsylvania side of the river, and covered by one of your batteries." "This is a strange request, Master Robert," said Washington, smiling, and evincing much curiosity. "You cannot bd scheming to place me in the hands of the enemy, when you design to conduct me within range of Knox's guns. But who is this important individual? You know we speak in confidence. My honour is pledged not to betray you to any one." "Charles Edward, the rightful King of Great Britain, France, Ireland, en dat Virginia quartum!" Washington, after gazing steadily for some moments at the face of Wales, said, with unwonted animation: "You know my character. You have never ventured to trifle with me, in matters of high import. I trust you never will." "No, sir, I will not!" replied Wales.  "Then, truly, Charles Stuart should have" remained away. Far better had it been for him to have continued where he was, in quiet obscurity. His race is doomed to extinction. I will not conceal from you, Master Robert, knowing as I do, for I have learned it from authentic sources, you take an interest in that man, that were he a hero, a statesman, or even a sober healthful gentleman, there might be a demonstration made in his behalf in this country. But as he is neither the one nor the other; as he possesses not a single qualification to conquer in the field or to govern in the cabinet; to which objection may be added, that of his reported impotency, debarring us of all hopes of a legitimate successor; I think I may say with confidence that there is not the slightest probability of his standard attract- ing, if erected on this continent, any considerable number of adherents."  "I hear the people," said Wales, "everywhere, asking what is to be the end of this unnatural conflict? It is said the royal commissioners, upon an accommodation, were, and still are, pre- pared-to make assurances, that the principles contended for by   THE MONARCHST.         103 those who incited the colonies to resistance, would be accorded by parliament; and yet Congress will be satisfied with nothing less than an acknowledgment of their independence, while they are flying from city to city, without an army, and utterly desti- tute of money! Pardon, me, sir; I see you frown. I speak in confidence, and to you alone. Be assured I hold a different language to the enemy. But no matter. To you I speak the truth. This state of things must cease, or else all opposition to the British arms will be discontinued, from the disinclination of the people to participate in it. They want a goal; they desire to perceive the ultimate object of the contest; they wish to be informed definitively what will follow the triumph of their arms. What species of government they will have, if they reject the proffers of George III." "When they have driven hence the invaders," said Washing- ton, "then they may deliberate upon the kind of government which will be best adapted to their wants; but before a people are competent to choose a government they must be free, and to be free, they must themselves first destroy the enemies of free- dom. Is that not an object before them, of sufficient importance? Why speculate upon the future, before we are sure of the present?" "Such is the language of wisdom," said Wales; " but are the millions wise? Believe it not! They are moved by sudden impulses, and by passion. At the beginning of this contest, their sympathies were roused in behalf of the victims of the British soldiers, and they flew to arms with great unanimity to avenge their brethren. But they have never understood the real merits of the question, nor can they be made to understand them. Having begun the war, without even comprehending the probable consequences, they were willing, by a sudden blow, to contribute to produce a revolution. That has not been effected, and they see no prospect of success. The American army under your immediate eye has dwindled down to three thousand effective men; General Howe commands nearly thirty thousand." "Master Robert, no-more of this! I do not despair. If we cannot beat the enemy, we may exhaust their patience and their means. A fortunate blow at some unguarded point, delivered at an unexpected moment, will again cause our people to rise in thousands." "But if they saw a prospect of reaping rich rewards and honourable titles for themselves and their families, would they not come by tens of thousands? And would this not be the case, if Charles were proclaimed King? Would not thousands of the     101        THE 'MONARCHST. enemy, who believe him to be the rightful heir, come over to his standard? Would not the powerful and rich Jacobite families of England, render immense assistance in such a cause? I think so. And I assure you that he has but recently married the Princess Stolberg, and may yet funish an illustrious line of successors. The other objections may not be well founded; they may prove to have been the interested representations of his enemies to make good men believe him incompetent." "Master Robert," said Washington, gravely, " you must be aware that whatever may be my private views and sentiments in matters of governmental policy, that I am, in my public capacity, but the instrument, the servant of Congress." "I know it, sir; and it was not in your public capacity that I desired, or expected you would visit the Prince." ' Well; perhaps I will see him, then; I shall be with Colo- nel Knox in the morning. But I must not see Charles alone; there must be witnesses. I must have Green, Sullivan, Knox, Cadwalader, Irwing, Putnam, Lee (if he arrives in time), Mif- flin, Mercer, Wayne, and Gates, present at the ceremony, and we must go thither without our swords and uniforms." "The more the better!" said Master Robert, whose plan ex- actly jumped with the suggestion of the prudent General. "Yet," he continued, "in ceremonies of this kind, those presented gene- rally retain their swords." "Some of the minor forms may be dispensed with, by Charles," said Washington, smiling, "since he holds his codrt'on board of a small merchant-vessel." "But," said Master Robert, "one of the generals you have named, I am sorry to say, cannot be present. I must beg your pardon for not mentioning his miscarriage before. General Lee has been taken prisoner; but his detachment escaped." "Is that true?" exclaimed Washington. "I had it from the lips of Lord Cornwallis this night." "Such is the penalty of disobedience of orders! I am not at all surprised at it!" Washington, then, making use of Master Robert's talents, as Jefferson was in the habit of doing, dictated the substance of a letter to the President of Congress, announcing the information he had received, in relation to Lee's capture. But he trusted not Master Robert, or any other amanuensis, with the particulars of his orders in relation to his contemplated enterprise against the British troops at Trenton.   THE MONARCHST.          105 CHAPTER IX. Why the vision cherish? Hope itself hath flown; Thy race is doomed to perish, Thrust from the British throne. *   *   *   *   * But freedom's chiefs must ne'er despair, Yield to defeat, or cease to dare. Snatch then the laurel from the foe And change their triumph into woe. CONTINENTAL RHYMES. AT the time appointed, Washington and his generals, who had been made acquainted with the- character of the individual that solicited an interview, and whose curiosity prompted them to be present on the occasion, 'were assembled at the place which had been designated, where a barge was in readiness to convey them to the vessel. This movement of the generals attracted much attention among the officers of inferior rank, and caused many speculations in regard to what might be on board the vessel, which seemed to attract their superiors so forcibly. As some- thing resembling a smile could be detected in the faces of all the generals, it was by many supposed that the wives of the chief- tains had been ordered to rendezvous in this manner. And as this impression prevailed especially among the aids of Washing- ton, and as one of them in particular, Colonel Joseph Reed, had lost all traces of his beautiful wife, to whom he was passionately attached, in the consternation which had prevailed in Philadel- phia, he made a desperate effort, upon parting with his chief at the edge of the water, to penetrate the mystery. "General," said he, his fair and smooth bald forehead slightly suffused with scarlet, and his long upper lip perceptibly quivering, "if Mrs. Reed should be among them, you will do me a very great favour to permit me to gp on board sometime during the day; or, if that be impracticable, to bring her with you when you return." "My dear sir," said Washington, " is there any probability of Mrs. Reed being on board of that vessel?" "If the wives of the generals have chartered the vessel, Gene-     106         THE MONARCHST. ral, I might suppose Mrs. R. would contribute something to meet her husband on the same occasion." "I am convinced. Mrs. Reed is not on board," said Washing- ton. "Where was she when you heard from her last?" "' The last time I heard from her I was informed that she had left Philadelphia for some retreat in Jersey, when Congress re- moved to Baltimore. But since then, and it seems to have been an age, I have not had any tidings of her being again in the city; and I am quite sure she could not have remained in New Jersey, since it has fallen pretty much into the possession of the enemy. Perhaps you may hear something of her on board the vessel, or there may be a letter for me. General! I believe I am a good whig; but if you would not see me abandon my principles, do not let my wife fall into the enemy's hands. I could not answer for the consequences. As much as I love my country, I am fearful I love my wife a little more; and it has been a long time since we were separated. Farewell, General; if you can think of it, please present my compliments to your lady." The barge shot out from the land, amid the irrepressible merriment of the Generals. "The poor Colonel," said Mercer, " will go stark mad if kept another month away from his lovely lady. Day and night he is sighing like a youthful lover! But no wonder, when he has such a splendid wife!" "And, poor fellow," said Wayne, "I doubt whether he will see her for two months to come, unless we bag the Hessians at Trenton." "No more of that, sir!" said Washington, in a half-whisper. "The oars may have ears." Wayne, known as "Mad Anthony," was then about thirty- two years of age. His stature was rather small. His chin and face were quite short; his eyes black and piercing, but very merry. His forehead was full and round, and his hair black and short. General Sullivan, who sat beside him, was his senior in years. He was tall, pale, and thin. His face and forehead oblong, with an excessively long nose, Roman, and resembling Lee's. But he wore whiskers, black and gray mixed. His cheeks were very lank, and his mouth serious; but his dark bright eyes expressed much liveliness and good-nature. Putnam was then nearly sixty years of age, large and fat. His hair was hideous, gray and shaggy. His large gray eyes seemed to be always full of merriment. His face was broad;   THE MONARCHST.         107 but his mouth handsome, shaped like Cupid's bow. His double chin denoted his great good-nature. Greene was fat and fair. His head bald in front, and his mouth shaped like Putnam's. His features were large, but the apparent indication of obtuseness observable on them was con- tradicted by the spirit and activity he displayed on many trying occasions. His lips were thick, and his mild blue eyes very wide apart. Aged thirty-five. Knox was tall, hard-featured, dark, and taciturn. His high cliff-like forehead seemed almost to be a deformity; and his dark eyes were as lights shining from caverns. His features were without regularity, and unhandsome. But altogether they expressed steadiness of purpose, system and ability. Aged twenty-seven. He was not as yet a general; but being the superintendent in the construction of the batteries on the river to prevent the enemy from crossing, and possessing an extraor- dinary share of Washington's confidence, he was included in the party. Gates, then aged about fifty, had a small body, with an ex- ceedingly large head. There seemed to be large wrinkles pass- ing in parallel lines running from his cheek bones downward, and meeting under his chin. There was a deep groove above his nose and between the eyes. His eyes were black; his hair mostly gray. His forehead low, his nose high and humped, but not strictly Roman, and the nostrils large. Master Robert, as well as Custis and Waples, were permitted to accompany the party. No one but Walsh seemed to be in attendance on deck, when the barge got alongside of the brig; and that dark gruff person- age appeared to be reluctant to admit our company; and only after some hesitation, and observing the impatient gestures of Wales, did he seem to decide that they might mount up the side of the vessel, if they could. Waples and Custis, having been reared near the water, and being somewhat familiar with the construction of vessels, were the first to spring on board. They put down the ladder with their own hands, and had the honour of assisting the great American chiefs in stepping on the deck. Wales expostulated with Captain Walsh on his unhandsome behaviour; to which he received a growling reply. Walsh would not introduce the company. He said his royal guest was indis- posed; and insisted upon having another day appointed for the meeting. To this Washington demurred. It was to be that day or never; and what was more, the brig could not be per-     108         THE MONARCHST. mitted to remain where she then was an hour after they quitted the deck. This brief parley was cut short by a voice from the entrance to the cabin, saying, "Come in, he will see you now. Come on! come on!' They moved in that direction. When they entered the cabin, they found Charles glowing with intoxication. He sat in an arm-chair, clumsily decked in' the royal robes of the preceding century, and glittering with jewels. "Which is General Washington?" said he, staring at the group before him; Ma^ter Robert pointed him out. 1 Where is your sword, sir?" asked Charles, rather passionately. "I looked for you to offer the service of your sword in my cause. And you come-nay, all of you-like so many priests, or non- combatants, to place the King upon his throne!" It was instantly perceptible to every one present that Charles was in no condition to hold a decent conference. His flushed face, the nearly empty bottle before him, and the silver cups lying at his feet, were evidences not to be mistaken of his abomi- nable habits, and present disgraceful predicament. "Our swords are not our own-" said Washington. "Are they in pawn?" asked Charles, quickly, and laughing heartily. "They are pledged in behalf of Congress," continued Wash- ington, gravely, who was disgusted, not amused, at the grovelling witticism and coarse ribaldry of one whose ancestors had occu- pied so much of the attention, and excited so much of the sym- pathies of the civilized world. "We came hither, sir, as private individuals, at your solicitation. As public characters, we have no authority, and no desire to act, but in accordance with the in- structions of the existing sovereign power which commissioned us. I mean the Congress of these confederated states." "Umph! I understand. What is the Congress doing? What are their ultimate designs?" "That is not for us, their servants, to answer." "But-but-have they-have you-all-forgotten your alle- giance? You must have a King! Must you not have a King? Am I not your sovereign by inheritance? Answer me that!" "It will be necessary for you to seek the response you desire from Congress. We acknowledge its authority, and no other. If you wish to make any communication to that body, I will furnish an express. to convey it." "No-sir! I will do no such thing! A vile set-a vile set, sir. To declare themselves independent of the crown! They will   THE MONARCHST.         109 be hung--all of them! I will not place myself in their power. If you want me to oppose this George III., as they call him, and to be your King, you must all swear to obey me, and give me guarantees that all the troops will espouse my interest, or else I will not put my foot upon the land!" "Then, sir, said Washington, " that you may be no longer in suspense or doubt, I will take it upon myself to declare that there is not the slightest possibility of the accomplishment of your views in this country." "Ha! Enough, sir! Begone, sir-all of you! You are not the deoiendanta of the COvalicrrj but the seeds of more Crou- wells! I will not stay an hour!" He pulled a cord, and the tinkle of a bell was heard on deck. Walsh soon appearing, Charles continued: "They are all arrant rebels and Cromwells, Walsh! We must set sail and be off. Lose not a moment, or we shall be seized." Most of the generals laughed heartily as they withdrew. Washington, however, was grave, and pained at the exhibition he  t witnessed. (' IIt is all over!" said Wales to Walsh. "There is no hope foiCharles. He is not fit to reign." Upon their return the generals mounted their horses, and were soon dispersed in various directions, executing the orders of their Commander-in-chief. And, in the mean time, it was observed that the brig had hoisted anchor, and was dropping down with the tide, amidst the floating ice. "I hope you heard something of my wife," whispered Colonel Reed to Washington, as he rode close up to the General, who had mounted his horse, and was inspecting the banks of the river on the opposite side with his glass. "My dear Colonel," said Washington, with much kindness in his tone, " she was not there; nor was there any one present who could give any account of her. Why not send for her? I cannot spare you from the camp at the present moment." "I do not know where she is to be found," was the despondent reply. "Very well; we will both make inquiries in relation to her, in the postscripts of our letters. You will not forget that?" At that time Colonel Reed was assisting Washington in his voluminous correspondence, and was his most confidential sec- retary. Washington then turned aside, and beckoned Custis and Waples, who were some paces in the rear, to approach him. "Young gentlemen," said he in a low tone, "I am about to' 10     "O        THE MONARCHST. employ you in a service which I fear will be novel to you, and may not altogether suit your impetuous dispositions. But I think you will oblige me." "All we ask is to be placed in a post of danger, and where we may be dangerous to the enemy," said Custis. "You must not be impatient to throw your lives away, young gentlemen. I must return you in safety to your mistresses, who, from what I can learn (from sources you least expect), would be inconsolable at your loss, notwithstanding their apparent dis- pleasure at present. Yet we must pay the debt we owe our country, and some of us may fall. In the hour of battle, I pro- mise you an honourable position. But we cannot be always fighting. We must first be in readiness for the combat. And until that is the case, which may be very soon, I desire that you will keep your eyes upon Master Robert Wales. I do not say he is false to us. You are not to suppose him such; but to be kind to him. Only remember he is to send no written commu- nication or verbal message across the river, or indeed in any other direction, until we march." The young men exchanged looks of intelligence, and bowed an acquiescence. "And," continued Washington, "by all means be careful you do not let him know that he is indebted to me for the pleasure of your company." Washington then galloped off in the direction of the quarters of Colonel Knox; and the young Virginians returned to the house which was, for the time being, occupied as the head- quarters of the army. They left their horses at a short distance from the house, in the care of a servant, with injunctions to feed them well, and to have the saddles in readiness at a moment's warning. They then proceeded to the chamber which had been allotted them, and in which Master Robert had likewise slept the preceding night. In those times, and in such places, men were glad to find almost any kind of shelter, and were not fastidious about the number of their room-mates. They found Wales sitting at a table before the fire writing a letter. "Sam," said Custis, I must write home for more money." "If they send any, Josiah Phillips will get it," said Waples. "Who is Josiah Phillips?" asked Wales, suddenly looking up "Who is he?" exclaimed Waples; "I thought everybody had heard of him, and especially you, who hear everything bad." This Josiah Phillips is a second Rob Roy MacGregor; he   THE MONARCHST.         1" commands about a hundred desperate robbers and tories, and sweeps the whole' country from Princess Anne, along the line between Maryland and Delaware, up to the head of Elk. They seize all the money, horses, and provisions found on the road to Philadelphia. They even capture young ladies and clergymen, and make their relatives and friends pay a ransom for them. When the Congress met in Baltimore, it was said they had formed a plan to sail over and seize the whole body!" "And what would they have done with them?" I suppose," said Waples, dryly, " they would have sold them to the enemy." A "pish!" was the only response made by Master Robert, who recommenced writing. "But if H do write," said Custis, " how shall I send my letter? I know of no one who can be hired to take it to Philadelphia; and I am sure I heard the General say there would be no express to-day." "Give it to me," said Wales, again looking up; "I'll send it." "Thank you, Master Bob; are you writing a letter to go in the same direction?" "Yes. I am writing to Mr. MacCoskie, giving him an account of the ridiculous conduct of the drunken Pretender, and urging him and Mr. Hewitt to relinquish all idea of seeing any Stuart placed upon the throne in this country." "You may well urge that," said Custis, "if the thing we saw to-day was a Stuart. Give us a Coeur de Lion, Master Bob, or even a Richard III., who will vault upon his champing steed, and waving his glittering steel over his head, cry to his soldiers 'Come on! I will lead you to victory!' Give us such a king as that, and we will follow him in battle, and bow to him in peace!' "Kings don't expose their sacred persons in battle, now," said Waples. "Even George III., who is not old, they say is becom- ing fat, with a paunch like his grandfather's, and a dull Dutch face, and huge protuberant eyes. Poh! I would prefer, greatly, :i  a Mary Stuart, or an Elizabeth Tudor to reign over us. Women cannot be expected to fight, and they are no more governed by their ministers than the kings. If the monarchs will not take the field, let them all bewomen." "But, sometimes the ladies," said Master Robert, "are not obeyed by their brave subjects and admirers; and, you know, they are generally opposed to war." "Sam," said Custis, "there is some truth and point in that observation. We must not argue with Master Bob; he knows too much for us."     "2        TIE: MONARCHST. "Well, write your letter, Tom; Master Bob, no doubt, will find a means of sending it." Wales concluded his letter immediately, and then threw his pen in the fire, saying it was good for nothing. He likewise placed in his pocket the inkstand he had been using, a small brass one. He then placed before Custis other writing materials. These things did not attract particular attention; for the young gentlemen were not fully initiated into all the mysteries of Mas- ter Robert's accomplishments. When Custis had finished writing his letter, which was a very brief one, and not at all designed to reach the person to whom it was addressed, for he had with him nearly a hundred guineas in money, he gave it to Master Robert, who had evinced some symptoms of impatience, and had more than once gone to the door which led into the rear-yard. A knock was heard, and this time Master Robert was met at the door by a tall countryman enveloped in a coarse cloak (for it was cold, and snowing moderately), who bore in his hand a larg6 basket covered with netting, and containing a dozen chickens. "This is the house, isn't it, where the great General Wash- ington stays?" he asked.* "Yes," said Waples. "Oh, you are the General himself, are you?" asked the sim- ple countrymen, in apparent earnestness. "Say yes, Sam," whispered Custis. "No, Tom; and I am deceived if he don't know better," Waples replied, in the same tone. "No!" said Master Robert, in his manly voice. You ought to know better." "May be, then, you are he!" Custis laughed heartily at this. But Waples said in a whisper he thought the fellow was not such a simpleton as he pretended to be. "My good man," said Master Robert, "the General is not here, nor do we expect him back for several hours. What do you want with him?" "I want to sell him my fowls." "Then the cook will do. You will find some one in the kitchen to buy your poultry, provided you don't ask too high a price." "Only six shilling, hard money, for the lot." "That is not extravagant," said Master Robert.; "and since you are so moderate in your expectations, perhaps I could engage you to do me a service for a moderate compensation?"   THE MONARCHST.         113 1Oh, I love to work for money. I'll do anything in reason, for reasonable wages."  "Very well. I suppose you came here on horseback?" "Oh, yes; but he belongs to my brother, and I can't sell i: lhim." "I do not wish to purchase your horse," said'Wales; "I merely want to hire you to ride to Philadelphia for me, and take some letters. You shall have a guinea in gold upon your return with the answers." "A guinea? in gold? By gosh, I'll do it! I've been there in worse weather than this, and for less money," "Then sell your fowls immediately and come to me for the letters." The rustic farmer withdrew, in seeming haste to be upon his profitable errand; and at the same time Waples disappeared quietly and without exciting any suspicion. "Master Bob," said Custis, when the two were left together, "do you think the sentinels will let him pass?" "Certainly they will let him pass out, since they let him come in. The General's table must be supplied. I suppose he came from the rear of the army, and not from the river." The countryman returned soon after with his basket empty, lhaving readily struck a bargain with the housekeeper. But he had no sooner announced himself ready to set out with the letters, than the arrival of another stranger was announced by the bark- ing of Washington's watch-dog in the yard. This was a sagacious animal of the Newfoundland breed, which always attended his master- at head-quarters, and invariably barked sharply once or twice whenever a. stranger approached the house, for the first time, where his master lodged. The signal of the dog was suc- ceeded by sounds of a different nature. A pig was heard grunt- ing and squealing in the yard, and the sound drew nearer, and increased in volume, until a knock announced its arrival at the door of the room in which our party were assembled. Upon opening the door Custis could not restrain his laughter. The individual who stepped in was muffled up to the eyes in the same manner as the vender of chickens, and bore upon his shoulder an old meal-bag containing the struggling pig. The animal was none of the gentlest kind, and in its violent exertions lhad contrived to thrust its snout through a rent, and thus was enabled to make its distresses known; with greater facility. "' Why do all the boobies, or booi's bring their live stock to this room?" asked Custis, petulantly, after stopping his ears for some time against the last prolonged squeal of the pig. 10*            :     "4        THE MONARCHTST. "Oh, he'll stop, now," said the countryman, placing his burden on the floor. "But," said he, glancing from under his slouched hat, which met the upright collar of his cloak about the nose, and which was enveloped with snow, " he's no more a boar than you are-for he's a sow-pig, and as fat as butter." "You'd better take him to the kitchen, stranger," said the first countryman, " and sell him to the old female-woman. She'll give you an oider on Major Gibbs for the money, but he'll pay you in rags; so'you might as well ask enough for it. But, good people all, I must bid you farewell, and be upon my road to Philadelphia." And he withdrew, humming one of the songs of the time. Custis followed him to the door, where he paused sufficiently long to perceive that Waples's horse had disappeared. A hasty glance enabled him to distinguish his friend at the far end of the lane which must be traversed by the vender of chickens. Then turning quickly, and closing the door after him, for it was an inclement day, and the wind blew directly into the room, he thought he perceived that Master Robert had been holding a hasty conversation with the second countryman, and that the latter had just deposited something in the pocket of his waistcoat. But he could not be absolutely certain of these things; and he mentally reproached himself for his momentary relaxation of vigilance. However, he inwardly resolved to remedy the neglect. "Why do you stay here with the filthy pig?" asked Wales, pettishy, addressing the man in a loud voice. "I want the gentleman," said he, "to be satisfied that I would not be guilty of so mean an action as to impose a boar pig on the lady, or on any one else." "Nonsense!" continued Wales; "it is a bore to us; it bores our ears most excruciatingly. Take it out." "Well, good day. I shan't see you again," said he, bowing awkwardly. "I am fond of roasts," said Custis, " and will just step along with you to see if it is fat." And he threw on his cloak and beaver, for the kitchen was some paces from the house, and fol- fowed the man, whose great height, and broad shoulders, he measured with his eyes; as if meditating upon the chances of success, should it be his fortune to have a trial of strength with him. Meantime the first countryman had mounted his bay filly, as he called an animal of mature age, and perfect proportions, but whose mane and tail were abominably matted with burs, and rode slowly along the lne leading from the house out to the great   ji            TIE MONARCHST.         115 road. The high-way ran from Philadelphia to Trenton, cross- ing the river at a ferry but a few miles distant. The road'was fenced on both sides, except in places of moderate extent, now on one hand and now on the other, where the ground was rendered unfit for cultivation by reason of the marsh, or where a tract of woodland lay unenclosed. Waples had proceeded slowly out of the lane, and continued at the same pace down the great highway in the direction of Phila- delphia. But when he had gone a sufficient distance to be hid- den by intervening fruit trees from the view of any one at the house, and yet not so far as to prevent him from seeing which way the countryman might turn when he emerged from the lane, he drew bridle and awaited the event. He was not long kept in suspense. The countryman, upon turning to the right, on leaving the lane, put his mare into a brisk gallop. Waples at the same time spurred his steed into a 1i  moderate canter, so as to be easily overtaken, and which happened in the course of some ten minutes.   "Which way, stranger?" asked the countryman, while yet a few paces distant. Nowhere in particular," said Waples, "so I may find, good cheer and sociable companions." The countryman, recognising the voice of one of the young men who had been with Master Robert, and recollecting the horse Waples rode, which had been feeding from a trough under a spreading apple tree, and which had arrested his attention before he appeared at the door of the room with his basket, checked his mnare suddenly, and seemed to hesitate what response to make to his apparently indifferent companion. "Oh, you are the gentleman I saw at the house," said the cnuntryman, boldly avowing his recognition of him. "But if ny opinion was asked, which it ain't, I should rather think that this is not exactly the sort of a day that Iwould choose to ride abroad for pleasure." "Very true, indeed, my friend,", said Waples; "I think so too, decidedly; for, in spite of my beaver, the flakes of snow will still find their way to my eye-lashes, and then I see double. Things have two aspects. Do you know that you seem to me, just at this time, to be quite a different person from the one who mistook Master Bob for the General?" "And perhaps my second appearance may be the correct one," replied the other; "aspects change in these shifting times, and eyes the most acute, and heads the most sagacious, are often de- ceived. It were well, perhaps, for all of us to avoid too strict a     "6         THE MONARCHST. scrutiny of things and persons which do not immediately concern Us."                / "Now, that is in character exactly with the aspect you have assumed in my eyes. I thought you might become, by the slightest exertion, a sensible and agreeable companion. The moment we met, or rather the moment you overtook me in the road, I said to myself he is not always the simple countryman. There must be mettle in him above a case-knife, with which to cut a pullet's throat." "And what if there should be? Have you any disposition to test its quality?" asked the stranger, halting entirely. Waples did the same. They were twenty feet apart, the latter being on the left side of the road, the other opposite. "No, I think not; on one condition, however." "What is that?" "Why, supposing it might be necessary for our General to peruse the letters you bear, and, perhaps, to add a postscript to one of them, I should be content, for the present at least, if you were to place them on the post of the fence to your right." ' It cannot be granted. They might be spoiled by the snow. I would rather place them in your hand." And taking the reins in his left hand, he put the other under his cloak. Waples did the same, and said- "Budge not an inch, sir! If your horse lifts a foot, she will throw you-at least you will fall!" The horsemen now watched each other with a steadiness and intensity which evinced the important consequences that might follow the slightest inattention. "Who are you?  Your name, before we fire!" said Waples, his eye fixed immovably upon that of his antagonist. "I will tell you in confidence, and provided you promise not to reveal it for forty-eight hours." "I may promise that, provided we part company. Now, tell me." "Captain Fritz, at your service; I am not in the service of the King, though; and hence I am no spy." "But you are a robber!" said Waples, " and the leader of a band of outlaws, most of whom are tories. Did that demon-dwarf know you?" "No matter. I have no more answers for you. I must not tarry here. You have the advantage of me. I shall have to fire across my mare's neck, if fire we must." "Must is the word, if you will not deliver the letters!" And at the word both fired. The brim of the young Virginian's   THE MONAItCHST.         117 hat was perforated, but be received no other injury. Captain Fritz fared differently. His pistol-arm was slightly shattered at the elbow, and fell useless at his side. And when Waples was in the act of discharging his second pistol, the bandit cried, "Hold! I am disabled! You would not murder an unresist- ing man, would you?" "No, I would not," said Waples, withholding his fire. "I feared I had missed the mark; and yet I am not convinced that this may not be a mere deception." "You have touched the bone at my elbow, sir; and my hand is palsied. I will turn and show you." By changing his position, the robber displayed his hand covered with blood, hanging at his side. "I suppose you will deliver the letters now?" said Waples, returning the pistol to his belt. "Not now!" cried the bandit captain, putting spurs to his mare, which sprang forward, and seemed to fly under the inflic- tion. Waples saw the error of his precipitate generosity. In an in- stant Fritz was beyond the reach of his fire; and again returning the pistol which he had once more drawn out, to its place, he fol- lowed in eager pursuit. His horse was second to none in Vir- ginia, and quite equal to the one for which Washington had bargained to pay Mr. John' Parke Custis 100. They were, indeed, colts of the same dam. On they flew; and for more than a mile the distance between them, some hundred paces, neither increased nor diminished. But when the hitherto level road was succeeded by a long gradual ascent, it became apparent that the mare was no longer a match for the more muscular horse. Waples not only gained rapidly upon the fugitive, but he contrived, without inconveni- ence, and without diminution of his speed, to draw his sword, which he held in readiness to use as soon as hq should get within reach of- his treacherous foe. He was not, however, destined to use it on that occasion. Fritz, on perceiving his danger, and that there was no possi- bility of escape, cried out lustily for quarter, and said he would submit. "Then we will ride to those tents in the woods on the left," said Waples, keeping his sword drawn, and in striking distance. "But have you not thrown away the letters, or destroyed them?" "How could I?  I would have done sot I admit; but it was out of my power."     "8        TIE i ONARCHST. And this was true enough. His right side was now literally covered with blood; his cloak having fallen back from his shoulders, revealed to the eyes of Waples the true condition of the wounded bandit. When they reached the tents that had been descried in the grove on the left of the road, Waples had the satisfaction of meeting Washington himself, who was about to mount his horse and return to his lodgings. The most inclement seasons never induced Washington to remit any of his accustomed duties in the field. From his youth up, he had been habituated to the hardships and privations of the camp, and rarely suffered from exposure to the most disagreeable weather. "Whom have we here?" asked he, gazing in some surprise at Waples and the wounded man, who had grown faint and pale from the loss of blood. "May it please your Excellency," said Waples, " he is one of the volunteer expresses with despatches for Philadelphia." "Ah, Waples, is that you?" said Washington; " but where are the letters? Never mind who sent them." "He has them in his pocket, sir; being wounded in the right arm, he says he is unable to get them out with his own hand; and he will be obliged to me if I assist him." Washington turned to Colonel Reed, his aid, and requested him to procure the use of a tent in which to examine the prisoner. Colonel Morgan tendered his, and Fritz was conducted thither. Waples searched his prisoner, and found the two letters which Master Robert had handed him in his presence. The contents of the one, written by Thomas Custis, Waples read aloud, at the same time stating the object (aside to Washington) for which it had been written. The one from Master Robert, Washington himself read aloud. It was not signed, nor did Washington name the author. And in truth one would not have thought it contained any intelligence of an injurious tendency. It seemed to be a simple narrative of facts connected with the occurrences on board the brig that morning; and concluded by assuring the one to whom it was addressed that there could be no hope of placing Charles Edward upon the throne in America. "Why did you fire upon the man for bearing such a letter as that?" asked Colonel Morgan. "He was obeying orders, Colonel," said Washington, placing the letter carefully in his pocket. "I fired no sooner than he did," said Waples, exhibiting the hole in his hat. "That was a narrow escape, my young friend," said Wash-   THE MONARCHST.         119 ington. "But where are the prisoner's arms?" Where were they sure enough? He had contrived to disencumber himself of his pistols, if he could not reach the letters. He had sup-   posed that one identified as an enemy, if taken disguised, and bearing arms, within the lines of the army, was liable to be hung as a spy. "( It is very strange!" said Waples, somewhat chagrined to find his assertion seemingly contradicted by the absence of the means in possession of his prisoner to perform the act alleged against him. "I can only repeat that he fired at me-that we both fired nearly at the same instant-that my ball wounded his arm, and his my hat. He certainly had pistols then, and I will follow his tracks till I find them. Do you deny what I have said?" he continued, turning to the prisoner. Fritz, after some hesitation, during which he doubtless reflected that if he denied it, proof would be produced against him, admitted what had been stated, and said by way of explanation, that every one in those days went armed. "Dr. Craik,'" said Washington, "you will be kind enough to examine his wound. Colonel Morgan, I desire you will keep the prisoner in' custody until he is demanded for trial." -4 ' The General, his aids and Waples, then departed for the farm- house, where dinner awaited them. Custis watched his man with equal vigilance. But he did not choose to have a race with him. His horse had recently received a hurt on his leg, which was not'yet sufficiently healed, in his opinion, upon a close. inspection, to put him to the top of his speed with impunity. Every Virginian, in those days, not only endeavoured to possess the best horse the country and his purse afforded, but when obtained, he really felt an affection for him, and would willingly suffer a moderate infliction himself, rather *  than make his cherished animal undergo any extraordinary exertion when not in a proper condition to bear it. Hence Custis racked his invention for the means of securing his man without the aid of his noble steed. Thus pondering, he paused in the vicinity of the pig-vender's animal, which was tied up to a post near the corn-house. "Scipio," said he, addressing one of Washington's black servants, who accompanied his master in his campaigns, and pointing to the dilapidated saddle on the countryman's horse, "if you would do me a favour, and your master a service, just take that saddle off and pitch it some ten feet into the corn-house." "I'll do it, Marsa Thomas!" said he, obeying with placrity; *  .           .     20        THE MONARCHST. "but de old ting is past gitting hurt by de snow or anyting else." "That was well done, Scipio," continued Custis, seeing that the negro flung it vigorously far beyond the mark he had indi- cated. "Now, vanish, Scip, as quick as lightning, and don't be seen by the owner of it, if he calls you a hundred thousand times. And remember, not a word to any one on the subject. Leave the rest to me." Scipio, displaying his faultless ivory in full array, instantly disappeared, but did not retire so far out of the way, as to prevent him from noting what might occur when the tall athletic owner of the saddle should appear. And he had decided in his own mind, that if any unpleasant consequences should ensue to his young countryman, as he called him, that he would be at hand to assist him, if not to relieve him altogether, by taking the whole responsibility upon himself. Being in ear-shot of the scene, the astonishment of Scipio may be imagined, when he heard himself roundly abused by Custis, after the countryman appeared and evinced surprise and displeasure on finding his saddle had been removed. "It was the fool of a negro removed your saddle, sir," said Custis. "The rascal deserves a hundred lashes for touching any saddle he is not ordered to remove. I cannot dismount at any time of the day, and for ever so short a time, that I do not find my saddle gone. The scoundrel must have a passion for taking off saddles. His father, grandfather, and great-grandfather were ostlers, to my certain knowledge." "You must have lived a great while, then," said the country- man, dryly. "Not more than twenty odd years, sir; but I tell you what I have heard others say." "Well, I suppose he has quite as much skill in putting them on, again?" "Oh, quite," said Custis, observing the change in the lan- guage of the impatient pig-vender. "Then where is he?" "'Pon my life, I don't know. Perhaps he's cutting the pig's throat, if it was not in reality a boar. Or he may be chopping wood, or blacking boots, or snoring in the corn-house. One thing is certain, he is not present when you want him." "Curse him! If I had his throat in my hand- -" "You would not murder him, would you? But truly, I do not wonder at your vexation. Yesterday I had to get my own saddle, because he was nowhere to be found." "And pray where did you find it?" asked the man, who had   THE MONARCHST.         121 untied the horse and approached Custis with the reins on his arm. "Oh, in the corn-house there. That is the depository for all the saddles he removes without orders." X:  "Then I must follow your example, and get it myself. But I cannot reach it! The rascal has pitched it to the extreme end of the crib! Would you be so kind as to get in and hand it out to nie?" "I would do so with a great deal of pleasure, but unfortu- nately a rheumatism with which I have been afflicted, has so stiffened my joints, that I could not mount up there and get in with convenience. You are more supple; I will hold the reins while you are getting it." The man looked into the very grave face of Custis and hesi- tated. It -could not but occur to him that one would not be likely to indulge in 4walks through a drifting snow-storm, when subject to attacks'of rheumatism, and while stiffened from a re- cent visitation of the malady. But there was no other alterna- tive, and no time for discussion; besides, Custis was but a mere stripling in comparison with himself, and he could not suppose there was any immediate danger of molestation. So he threw the reins over the young man's arm, and sprang into the corn- house. What a puff of wind!" exclaimed Custis, as he slapped to the door. "Open it again!" cried the countryman; " there is not enough light from the chinks to enable me to find the saddle." "Wait a moment," said Custis, turning the key in the lock, and depositing it in his pocket. "Well, why the d  1 don't -you open it?" exclaimed the prisoner, thumping at the door. "What!" said Custis, "open the trap and let the rat out? You must take me to be a very great fool! No, no; you must remain where you are, until we get the terriers. In plain words, we suspect you to be one of the Doanes, and a member of Cap- tain Fritz's gang of tories and outlaws." This was answered from within by a growl of rage, which was followed by the discharge of a pistol. The robber's horse near the door sprang upwards in the air and fell dead. The ball had passed through the door and penetrated the brain of the animal. "You have killed your own horse, I believe," said Custis, who had anticipated some action of the kind, and had moved out of the way. "But if you fire again, it will be your last shot. I have dte advantage, as you know; do not tempt me to make use "     122         THE MONARCHST. of it. Scipio!" he continued, in a loud voice, C go to Captain Gibbs, and tell him what you have seen. Say, I will be obliged to him if he will send me four trusty men to guard this rat." Scipio, now comprehending the whole proceeding, set off at a brisk pace through the orchard, laughing very heartily, and soon returned, preceding the required guard. Until darkness began to set in, the prisoner chewed the cud of mortification, beholding his guard promenading with deliberate and measured step round the corn-house. He gazed through the crannies at the bayoneted muskets borne by the muffled statue- like sentinels placed around him, and he felt that there was scarce a possibility of escape. His only hope was that if he should be suffered to remain in his present place of confinement until a late hour in the night, he might succeed in finding egress through the roof, which was of a frail texture, and then success- fully run the gauntlet of their bullets in the darkness. With meditations of this nature his mind was entirely occupied, and he remained silent in his prison. But shortly before it grew quite dark, he was startled by the voices of approaching men. "Well, sir," said Custis, "have you made up your mind to submit? Or must we shoot you in the trap?" No answer being returned, Waples placed his face near a cre- vice, and said in loud tones, "Jack Doane, awake! rouse up, man; you are wanted." "I am not asleep," said the prisoner, sullenly. "Then why don't you answer my question?" asked Custis. "There are four of us, well armed, besides the guard; eight men against one. Will you submit peaceably?" "There would be no use in resisting," answered the prisoner; "besides, I am sick." "Yes, and I saw you swallow a pill!" exclaimed Waples, still peering through the crevice. "We will have it out again; Dr. Craik must analyze all the medicine taken without his orders." "Come out!" said Custis, throwing open the door; "but first throw out your pistols." There was a pause. "Throw them out, I say!" continued Custis, " or else we must put the muzzles of ours in." He threw them out; and then he came forth himself, quite submissively, and was conducted to a chamber in the upper part of the house, where Washington and Dr. Craik awaited him. "Sir," said Washington, after a long scrutiny of the for- bidding, though abashed features of the prisoner, I am sorry to find you in this predicament."   THE MONARCHST.         123 "So am I, General," said he; "but I have done nothing wrong, that I am aware of." "Is not your name Jack Doane, and are you not one of the notorious seven brothers, of tories and outlaws?" I  "Jack Daane is my name; I will not deny it. But if I am a tory, merely because I like the King better than Congress, there will be found more men to be hung than there are hangmen. If I am an outlaw, it is because I have been proclaimed one by those who had no authority to do it. I have not fought on either side in the war, as some of my brothers have done, and I am therefore innocent." "Have you no intelligence for the enemy about your person, at this moment?" "No, sir." "Search him, gentlemen." It was done; but nothing was found! upon him, except an ex- ceedingly long-bladed knife, and another pistol, making three with which he usually went armed. j  "Now, friend, I must search you within," said Dr. Craik. "I have a means of examining the contents of,one's stomach. My young friend here saw you swallow something, which I must have out of you again."      .  Do you deny having swallowed something in the corn-house?" demanded Waples. "No; I don't deny it. It was a pill; I was sick atthe stomach, and took it as a remedy." "How was it to act?" asked the doctor. "It was to purge me; and Im thinking-" "Never mind, never mind!" said the doctor. "Here is the antidote; swallow this immediately." "What is it?" asked the man, looking with aversion at the pill tendered him. "No matter what it is; I am the doctor, and will be responsi- ble for the result." "I don't want it!" said the prisoner. "As you please; I have another remedy; but not so agree- able a one, I fear. It is my stomach-pump. Gentlenien, I must have your assistance," he added, addressing the young men, and making preparations to put his hydraulic machine in operation. "Why delay?" asked Washington, addressing the prisoner. "You see that resistance cannot avail you. Gentlemen," he con- tinued, retiring from the room, "you will be kind enough to report the result to me immediately."     124         THE MONARCHST. The withdrawal of the General removed the constraint which his presence never failed to impose upon the young. "Now for some sport!" said Waples, throwing aside his coat and rolling up his shirt-sleeves. "Shall we put him on his back, doctor?" "No; that is not exactly the position; but you may bind his hands behind him, so that he cannot interfere with us. The operation, I am sorry to say, will not be pleasant, my friend," said the doctor. "Give me the blasted pill, then!" cried the prisoner, and on its being handed him, he swallowed it without making a wry face. "You must not abuse the medicine," said Dr. Craik; "it does valuable service sometimes. I must now trouble you to take a glass of water; it is a little warm, but quite pure." The result of the emetic was not quite satisfactory. The de- spatch he had swallowed had been covered with a soluble coating, and prepared for the purpose of promoting a rapid digestion of the paper itself. However, fragments of the letter were produced, but not in a condition to be clearly understood by the uninitiated. The only words distinguishable were "wing of the army," "Trenton,"' "clipped," "Christmas ;" and these were in detached fragments, and could not be made intelligible to the company by any connexion in which they were enabled to place them. When they were exhibited to Washington, he deposited them carefully on his table, where he concealed them with a newspaper. He requested Custis and Waples to have the prisoner strictly guarded, so as to render his escape impossible, and then signified his wish to be left quite alone. For some fifteen or twenty minutes Washington devoted him- self to the study of the printed maps, and the pen-sketches of the counties in which the next military operations would be likely to transpire. All was still and silent, except the cricket at his feet, and the clicking of the tall clock which stood in a corner of the room. It might have been a scene for the painter, who could penetrate the future, and imagine the mighty conse- quences to ensue from the mute meditations of that solitary in- dividual, bending over a homely table in a plain farm-house, while his army without did not exceed five thousand disciplined men; and contrasting it with the luxury and magnificence of the wide-spread camp of the enemy, where titles, gold, and nearly thirty thousand fully-equipped regular soldiers were eager to crush him. The Commander-in-chief had determined not to des- pair; and his firm countenance inspired his countrymen with hope, amidst all the disasters which befell them.   THE MONARCHST.         125 ^ When the clock struck twelve, Washington ceased from his studies, and put aside the charts. And the next moment Master Robert Wales, entering without knocking, as he had been in- structed to do, silently glided to a seat which had been pointed out to him. "It was agreed," said Washington, looking the diminutive object before him fully in the face, and with a mixture of sadness and censure in his voice, "that you were to remain with me until after the attack upon the enemy at Trenton." "True, sir; and it is my purpose to remain until then." "But it was not stipulated, I believe, that you should send no intelligence of our intended enterprise to the enemy?" "It was not," said Wales, with symptoms of satisfaction. "But it must have been implied; else why should you remain in our camp?" "Mine is a difficult part to play," said Wales. "I wish no evil to befall either party. I would prevent the slaughter of my fellow beings, if possible; but you are aware that I am a mo- narchist, and that my object is to promote a reconciliation." "Duplicity and prevarication are not the best means to accom- plish that end. Think you that the King will be likely to offer such terms as Congress can accept, at the end of a successful campaign, and with an overwhelming force in the field, while our army is reduced to a mere nominal establishment, and our people disheartened by a long series of reverses? No, sir; I thought you were a better diplomatist! No terms will be offered  to which we can subscribe; or if any be subscribed, they will not be fulfilled in good faith by the party having all the power. They would reduce us to a state of slavish dependence, more de- grading even than any they had contemplated before we resorted to arms in defence of ourliberties. If we fail of obtaining the rights, " the privileges we demanded, after venturing upon the scene of open warfare, we shall forfeit the sympathy, the respect of man- kind, and be deemed worthy of the worst fate that may be des- tined for us by our masters. These are the considerations which operate upon Congress and the country, and they are reasonable. You are learned in the history of nations, and I mention them for your consideration. For my part, I have nothing to do with them in my official capacity. I am the servant of Congress; and it is my duty, in obedience to their orders, to exert all my powers against the enemy in the field, and to guard against treachery in the camp." "Sir," said Wales, " you have pledged me your protection, and I have not concealed my views from you. I am conscientious "*     126        TIIE MONARCHST. in my motives; frank in my declarations. When I hoped that Charles might recover this portion of the dominions of his ances- tors, I desired to see, of course, the armies of King George overthrown; but since that project has proved to be impracti- cable, it is very rational to suppose that the only means of restor- ing regal authority is in the suppression of the resistance to it. I will not deny the force of the argument, that to treat upon a basis of mutual confidence, and reciprocal advantage, there should be no apparent great preponderance of power and might on the side of the monarch. Else there could be no guarantee for any concessions, or probability of a prolongation of the peace. And it has been in view of this, that I have from time to time ob- tained for you such information as was calculated to enable you to counteract the King's generals. And now I really regret that my impetuosity got the better of my discretion this morning upon my return from the brig. But it is too late-" "What have you done?" "Suffice it that your enterprise against the detachment of the enemy at Trenton, must fail." "No," said Washington, smiling; "it must not fail, unless you are a better general than I am. I have fixed my heart upon the success of the enterprise; and it is as much the part of a wise commander to take precautions to prevent failure, as to omit no duty which may contribute to success." "I fear, sir," said Wales,. "your vigilance has not been quite sufficient." "I have Captain Fritz a prisoner." "I thought so. The letter he had was not for the enemy, at least not for any of the British. Fritz, although brave, and desperate in the field, is not the most discreet of my agents, nor the one I employ on very important occasions." "Then, behold what I have here!" said Washington, removing the Gazette which concealed the particles of the letter extracted from the stomach of Jack Doane. Wales stared at them in utter astonishment. "I recognise the hand, sir!" said he; " and I declare to you that I do not regret the success you have met with. The young Virginians, once my pupils, were your instruments. I forgive them, as they have demonstrated they had a good master. You will take the detachment at Trenton, a prize I designed for Charles; I hope there will be no great effusion of blood, as they will not be expecting such an attack; but if there should be, they are Hessians, and ought never to have been sent hither." "I trust, now, Master Robert," said Washington, ' that you   I1 THE MOSNArCIIST.        127 will not again seek to convey any intelligence to the enemy, which : may thwart our purposes. It is disagreeable to have one amongst us, so capable of rendering important services to the cause, and who has already served us on several occasions, whom we must Hi  regard with suspicion. Fortunately no one but myself has com- prehended the import of your recent communications." "You have my promise, sir, that I will not repeat the attempt to inform the enemy of your projected enterprise.. But I must petition for the release of the two messengers, if they have been confined." I   "I learn," said Washington, "that Fritz escaped about an hour after his wound was dressed. Lieutenant Waples had dis- abled his right arm by a pistol shot; and the men Colonel Mor- gan charged to watch him, supposing one in his condition would not attempt an escape, relaxed their vigilance. Doane has suf- fered somewhat under the prescription of Dr. Craik. He may go on his parole-though I have my doubts whether he will regard his word when he again falls into temptation. But he must not be released until the 28th instant." "In return for your kindness, sir," said Master Robert, "I will make you a revelation that may effectually guard you against your foes that are not in the camp of the enemy. There is a party in Congress, and also a cabal of superior officers, who are conspiring to have you superseded in the chief command. This I learned from unquestionable sources when in Philadelphia." "I have had intimations of the same thing. If a more effi- cient man can be found, and I think he might be, his elevation would be a source of happiness to me, rather than a mortifica- tion." "But he cannot, will not, be found; he does not exist. Neither is the conspiracy yet formidable. The least success of your arms will silence their clamour. They only prate in times, of disaster. On some other occasion I may be at liberty to de- s:gnate the men I know to be engaged in it; you may possibly know some of them already; but I cannot reveal more at pre- sent. Should the danger become imminent, you will be warned. On the other hand, you have a friend of influence, Mr. Edward. Biddle, who proposes, on some fitting occasion, to have still higher honours conferred on you." "And what may they be? I have already duties and responsi- bilities enough." "He will petition Congress to have you made Emperor. Should that be agreeable to you, the armies of George III. would thenceforth be scattered like chaff; the--"     128         THE MONARCHST. "Hold, sir! my worst enemy could not aim a more fatal blow at my peace of mind, and prospects of future happiness! They mistake my disposition who suppose I can desire to spend my life amidst the turmoils and anxieties of public employments. The haven of rest I look forward to, is in the peaceful shades of Mount Vernon. There I would pass the declining stages of my life, under my own vine and fig-tree; inaccessible to the annoy- ances of political intrigues for place, and wholly relieved of the burdens and perils of high position." "But you would not see the great empire you shall found, if, in the end of this conflict, victory perches on your banners, desecrated by profligate politicians, who, having contributed nothing towards its establishment, would only seek to control it, and to possess it, for purposes of self-aggrandizement. You would not be content to see the fruits of your labour monopolized by a set of hungry demagogues, whose ambition and desires are bounded by the present, and who are alike incapable and indis- posed to provide for the transmission of a beneficent inheritance to posterity! Your peaceful shades would not afford enjoyment, your profound retirement insure no happiness, while you remained conscious of the havoc made by the irresponsible cormorants. On you, alone, all parties would unite in reposing confidence; but when you retired from the scene, a hundred aspirants, of equal claims, or of no claims at all, would distract the country." "We will not discuss matters so far in the future, Master Robert," said the General, smiling. "If we succeed in defending ourselves, and in establishing our liberties on a firm foundation, it will be by the assistance and guidance of Providence; for surely the contest has been, and is likely to be, very unequal in point of men and material. But if we do succeed, it will then be time enough to make arrangements for our civil government, and doubtless the omnipotent hand which will have conducted us to that end, will provide the ways and means of perpetuating the good work." "And if so," continued Wales, with animation, " the govern- ment will not be a democracy. If we have faith in sacred his- tory; if we believe in divine revelation; we cannot close our eyes to the fact that monarchies are in accordance with the polity of heaven, and have the sanction of God. To suppose that men will remain equal in power, because so created, is an absurdity: and for rulers to be obeyed, they must be exalted and respected, which cannot be the case in a democracy, where the tenure of all persons in power depends on the caprice of an undiscerning multitude; and whose verdict may at any time be reversed by   THE MONARCHST.         129 themselves. The democratic rulersl knowing there existed no probability of transmitting their honours or emoluments to their posterity, would prey upon the vitals of the state, and make the most of their passing opportunities. Whereas, in a monarchy, the king and nobles would be most interested in the perfect welfare of the state, knowing that in its permanent prosperity their re- motest descendants would have their reward." "Master Robert," said Washington, "I fear I shall forget your arguments in the scenes of strife yet to ensue in the field. When the sword is laid aside, then such speculations might be ap- propriate. Still, I have no hesitation in saying that the supreme executive in a state, or of a confederation of states, should be vested with the power of coercing obedience on the part of the people. The Congress, it must 'be owned, have not at present that power. They cannot, it seems, compel the states to furnish their. quotas in the present exigency, which is of serious, and may be of fatal, detriment to the cause. The form will have to be modified; but unfortunately nothing whatever of the kind can be attempted at present. And I would see dignity attached to persons of high position; nor would I object to see the posterity of great and virtuous characters distinguished and honoured in the land, as an example and stimulus for others. I am likewise aware that when rewards for services and sacrifices in the cause of the public must depend upon the action of the people them- selves, or their representatives in Congress, they are liable to be overlooked and withheld; and I have incurred the imputation of being an aristocrat, for proposing to Congress to allow the officers of the army pensions, or half-pay, for life." "I know it. But public benefactors can never be recompensed in a republic. Your recommendation has failed. If adopted, it will be sometime hereafter, when the demagogues in Congress are driven to desperation by the approaches of the enemy. How different it would be, were you declared Emperor! Like William the Conqueror, your officers would be compensated by the for- feited estates of the enemy, and by titles, which would be enjoyed by themselves, and cherished by their descendants." "Enough of that!" said Washington, shaking his head gravely. "I have ambition, and would leave a name not unknown to the world, nor unhonoured. That, alone, would be sufficient compen- sation for me. I have no children." "True!" said Wales. "It would be enough for you. When you shall achieve the independence of your country, and volun- tarily retire to your rural estate on the Potomac, the world will be filled with your renown. Your fame will reach remotest ages; and your character will be exalted above that of any of the bene-.     130         THE MONARCHST. factors of the earth. All this is very certain; and for you it will be a greater guerdon than a crown. But, alas! how selfish is poor human nature! How readily do we become the victims of self-deception, and pursue the glittering temptations of the world, while we are absolutely disavowing them to others! A throne would radiate its beneficent rays upon the hearts of millions, now and hereafter. Thus the prize, won at the expense of so much blood and treasure, would be justly participated in by all who contributed to win it, and by their descendants, to remotest generations. But, instead of that, you would have all the illus- trious deeds of a continent concentrated in one halo of glory, which you would modestly wear upon your own unambitious head; and to heighten its brilliance by contrast, you would wear it under the shadow of your own vine and fig-tree!" "Sir! sir! This is too much to be borne! Do you mean to ascribe such motives to me?" said Washington, rising in great agitation. "No, sir, not to you; but to poor human nature. 'Vanity of vanities,' saith the prophet, 'all is vanity!' But I see in the future a solitary, imperishable crown of glory, to be grasped and enjoyed by one individual alone, if the laws of nature and the voice of God be disregarded, when this contest is over, and the victory won by America. You will enjoy it. The secret recesses of your heart are now quivering with desire and anticipation. It will be yours, even if a republic be substituted for the mo- narchy. For, high above the ruins of the government, when in the lapse of a century, perhaps, patriots and statesmen, behold- ing the elevation of unworthy men, as the result of the prefer- ences of the fluctuating mob-despair and destruction-disunion -civil war-anarchy-despotism-shall ensue; amid the wreck of inefficient systems, and the decay of public virtue-above all others in the firmament of illustrious names, yours will still shine with undiminished splendour! But you will leave no children. Happy thought! While in the exclusive enjoyment of the fruits of a revolution, there will be no descendant of yours robbed of his rightful inheritance, nor left to writhe in the common agony attending the universal chaos that must spread its blighting atmosphere over the continent!" "Man, or boy! whichever you are," said Washington, "you are mad!" -"God knows!" aaid Walw, whil fearful maerks of agitation and distress were exhibited on his brow. His face was deadly pale, and tears fell from his eyes. "It is a mad world, since those regarded as the truly good, and the great lights of the age,   :        THE MONARCHST.          131 are impelled by the same motives which actuate the breasts of those who are the most transparent in baseness!" But are you aware, Master Robert," said Washington, frown- ing, "that such observations, if applied to me, are offensive, and cannot be borne?" "They refer to human nature. But immortal as you would be, and as the voice of mankind would make you, still you are human. Why, sir, they style Mrs. Washington, 'Lady Wash- ington;' and the arms of her' first husband are quartered with yours, on the panel of your coach. And the head-gear she wears is called the 'Queen's cap.' Oh, sir, tell me that your determi- nation to refuse a throne is not irrevocable. Much depends on it." "It is irrevocable. I will abandon all public employments as soon as this work is accomplished. But, if I know my own heart, it will be with different motives from those you have been pleased to ascribe-to it." a   "You feel it to be so, and believe so. But in your retirement, and in the closing days of your life, your moments will be em- bittered by the conduct of those highest in the administration of the government.  And then, when you see the error, it will be too late to correct it."* * See Washington's last letters (edited by Sparks), written but a few days previous to his death. The conduct of his successor in the presi- dential chair, and of another who aspired to it, roused his indignation, and might, had he lived a few years longer, have induced him to resume the reins of government.     s^ow        TTHLE MONARCIIIST. CHAPTER X. The foemen fly from the embattled plain, And yield their banners to the conq'ring band, But generous tears embalm the heroes slain, While shouts of triumph echo o'er the land. OLD GAZETTE. THE day had arrived for the American Commander-in-chief to perform the operation of clipping one of the wings of the enemy; and it was to be performed most skilfully, and with complete success. He had planned the attack from three different direc- tions, and had divided his little army into as many columns, any one of which, in the event of the failure of the others to come upon the field, would be sufficient, it was supposed, to carry the place by surprise, and probably to capture the greater portion of the detachment of Hessians. At all events, it is known by every one that the column he commanded in person was the only one which crossed in time, and by it alone the work was accomplished. There was a little desultory firing, but no battle. The next day Washington recrossed the Delaware with his prisoners, about a thousand in number. They were immediately marched to Philadelphia, to cheer the spirits of Congress, which was to re- assemble there in a few weeks. Master Robert had not accompanied the expedition, but re- mained at head-quarters writing letters, but not treacherous ones, to the enemy. A few evenings after the return of the army to the Pennsyl. vania side of the river, there was a substantial feast prepared at the farmhouse occupied by Washington. Many of the officers were present, as well as Wales and the young Virginians. During the sitting, and while the company seemed to be more exhilarated by their recent success than by the indifferent liquors of which they had partaken (but which of course were the best the Commander-in-chief could procure), there was one despond- ent head and lugubrious visage which attracted the attention of Washington. "Cheer up, my friend," said he, in tones of kindness, to Colonel Reed. "A few weeks more. and you shall have per-   TlE1 IVUiNARUCHST.       133 mission to seek aft r your lady. There can be no doubt of her personal safety. She is in some secure retreat with the children." This produced a general smile, for it was known to all the superior officers that the Colonel had suffered much anxiety on account of the mystery attending the locality of her who was dearer to him than life. And it was"well known that Mrs. Reed was a lady altogether worthy of such devotion. Yet there was something in the subject which excited merriment. -  "Has she been in danger of falling into the hands of the enemy? asked General Putnam, his laughing eye resting on the Colonel. "No," said the Colonel; not that I know of?" "I trust not!" said Washington. "Then why despond?" "I had tidings of her at Trenton. I met an acquaintance in the hurry of the skirmish, and just when a flight of bullets rattled by, who would pause only long enough to say she had been at a cottage in the pines, east of Burlington. And that was all I could learn," said the Colonel. "And you had the coolness to make inquiry at that critical moment?" continued Putnam.  "I can answer that," said Wayne. "There was a shower of grape-shot passing over our heads when he came to me with the order of the Commander-in-chief to advance against Colonel Rahle's left; he did not seem to know it; but turning to a lad that had run in among the troops, and whom it seems he bad known, he commenced a conversation with him. I did not hear the subject of it: but no doubt it was to make inquiry about his lady." The Colonel did not deny it. "The Colonel shall have his good lady soon," said Washington. Gentlemen," he continued, "we have only to drive the enemy out of Jersey, when most of us may enjoy the smiles of our wives. Do you know I have written to mine to meet me at Mor- ristown, which is to be my head-quarters?" "Good! Bravo!" exclaimed several, in subdued tones of ex- ultation. "But,"continued Washington, "there must be given some severe blowsfirst. The affair at Trenton will make the enemy aware that we are not incapable of strategy; and will prove to our own countrymen that our cause is not entirely hopeless; but we have next to demonstrate that we can also fight, and that too, in the presence of superior numbers." 12     134         THE MONARCHST. This announcement was received with great satisfaction. Nothing so much revives the spirits of soldiers, as the prospect of immediate battles; and nothing so much depresses them as the probability of long remaining inactive in camp. There was one present, however, whose features did not indicate any special satisfaction. Yet he seemed rather to be absent in his thoughts than vexed at the anticipated victories. It was Master Robert; and upon being appealed to as usual for his opinion, by one of the generals, merely observed that he hoped the next success of the American arms, would be followed by a reconciliation and peace between the countries. "Amen, with all my heart!" said Washington. So might I,' and all of us say amen to it," remarked Wayne, "if it were not past praying for." "True bnough," said General Mercer. "But how is it pos- sible for us to treat with the royal commissioners? There must be at least two parties to a treaty, and they will not allow us to be one. It is to be first submission on our part, and then they will forgive and forget, and, perhaps, remove our grievances." "And if we be not equal or independent, in adjusting the terms of an accommodation," said Washington, " how can there be any obligation on their part to fulfil them, or any guarantee that they will be complied with?" "None, whatever," said Putnam. "The die is cast; inde- pendence and separation, or total subjection; we have no other alternative." We can only meet them at the point of the sword," said Mercer. Little did he then suppose he would fall, his breast penetrated by many bayonets, in the space of a few days! "There are precedents for the contrary," said Master Robert. "Magna Charta was obtained from King John at Runny-mead, by his subjects. And it is for the same principle that you now contend." "And that proves it was violated," said Washington. "But I hope it is no proof, it may not be established again, and for six centuries more," said Wales. "The ocean will be a good barrier between us and the encroachments of the sovereign. There can be no sudden surprise, as there was at Rochester Castle." "And no prince from abroad to espouse our cause, and bring us aid, if we should happen to be hard pressed," said Sullivan. "The son of Philip, whom the barons sent for," said Wales, "had married the English King's niece; so the heirs would have been of the blood royal. It might be well if we had some   THE MONARCHST.         135 of the Langtons, Pembrokes, and Warennes of old England among us to heal the wounds of the empire." "Such matters must be attended to in the cabinet," said Wayne. "-Our duties are in the field. By the Way, General," he continued, lowering his voice, "what sort of dare-devils are these two young men you have from Virginia? The people some- times call me mad for venturing a little; but these young bloods are perfect maniacs in battle. They absolutely made a race of it, to see which could reach the enemy first, and when they did come up with their light-horse which scampered off for Borden- town, every leap of their steeds left a man on the ground. They seemed to keep time with their swords, and every blow was fatal. I wish you would let me have them." "No, indeed! That would not be the way to preserve their lives," said Washington "but I must lecture them before the next engagement. I will be held responsible by their sweet- hearts if they should fall. Their mistresses, though offended because they have joined us in the war, I am assured would not have them slain for worlds. They must be sent back uninjured at the end of the campaign." I see; they are in disgrace with their mistresses; and that is the reason of their desperation. What a blow it would be to those young ladies, if they were really to fall! Do lecture them, General. But what might we not accomplish with ten thousand such young men? "Incalculable achievements. And yet, suppose their mistresses should become suddenly reconciled; what, thinks you, might be the result?" "There is no telling what it might be, when we behold the condition of the gallant Colonel. Antony's conduct at Alexandria should no longer be considered contemptible." That night the Commander-in-chief issued his order for the army to march in the morning, and occupy Trenton. At Trenton Master Robert, as if convinced that the Americans would be more likely to effect a reconciliation with the mother country after a series of successes, than under the influence of repeated reverses, which latter seemed to make no impression on the spirit and determination of Washington, concluded to exert his skill in procuring intelligence of the movements of the enemy. He obtained the release of Jack Doane, who, obedient to his superior, and somewhat indifferent upon what side he operated, was despatched with a pig to the British camp. There he learned that Lord Cornwallis, instead of sailing home with the news of the demolition of the American army, as he intended, had left     136         THE MONARCHST. New York for the scene of war again, and was daily looked for at Princeton, on his way to attack Washington. The day after the reception of this news, another note from Doane stated that Lord Cornwallis had arrived at Princeton, at which place there were to be left three regiments under the command of Colonel Mawhood; while the rest were to be marched immediately toward Trenton. An hour after this intelligence was received, General Greene, who was posted in the van of the American army, now -augmented by several thousand militia, who had joined the ranks within the last few days, perceived the approach of Lord Corn- wallis. He did not deem it prudent to give battle; and Wash- ington, on being advertised of the strength of the advancing column, retired with his army over the Assumpinck Creek, and there made dispositions to defend his ground. "Be not cast down, young gentleman," said he, turning to Custis and Waples, who manifested symptoms of disappointment, when they supposed there would be no battle, for it was soon ascertained that the British could not cross the creek that day, and they feared the day following their commander would retire beyond the reach of danger. "Take your rest, and be ready for warm work. Before morning we must endeavour to be in the rear of the enemy; and then, you know, we can hardly avoid coming to blows." On either side of the little stream the camp-fires gleamed brightly that night, and the measured tramp of the sentinels ceased not to be heard till morning. But when the sun rose, the J3ritish General was startled by the report of cannon; and upon ascertaining that Washington and his army, his sentinels only excepted, were gone, he was seized with alarm, and prepared to hasten back to the assistance of Mawhood at Princeton. There were astonishments on all sides. Mawhood, thinking Cornwallis might require his aid, had made a night march as well as Wash- ington, and so the two parties met unexpectedly about midway between Trenton and Princeton, early in the morning. Maw- hood, supposing the Americans to be but a small detachment, assailed them with confidence; but was soon surprised to find, that although the raw militia were thrown into confusion, accu- mulating forces still rose in his front, and threatened to encom- pass both of his wings. At last he became conscious that he was contending against the whole American army with Washington at its head, and then the word was sauve qui peut. Some four or five hundred being killed and wounded or taken, the remainder desperately rushed through the line opposed to them, and hastened to meet Lord Cornwallis, who was advancing rapidly to their relief.    THE MONARCHST;         137 General Mercer had led the van, and, in compliance with their urgent solicitation, the young Virginians were permitted to ac- company him. They had promised Washington to attend strictly to the orders of their leader, and to keep near his person in the combat. And faithfully did they keep their promise. At the very crisis of the battle, Mercer, when attended on either hand by his youthful aids, received a mortal wound, and was borne off a short distance from the scene of conflict. "Leave me here!" cried the brave General; "this handful of soldiers (only four) will be sufficient to protect me." "Never " -cried Waples, who perceived that a panic had seized upon the discomfited enemy, and that they were rushing in disorder, but in overwhelming numbers, in that direction. Although they advanced, it was not a charge. Enveloped on the right-and left, and in the rear, there was no other alternative but to rush forward, where the opposing line was weakest. On they came, nearly in a direct line with the wounded General. Discovering his rank and condition, a small detachment diverged sufficiently from the line of march to assail the few soldiers around him. Although the four men at his side died bravely, and Custis and Waples revenged them, and even repulsed the attack, yet new parties came up and surrounded the prostrate General completely. Then, fighting over' his body, Custis and Waples saw him bayoneted by the enraged grenadiers. Being mounted, they parried the thrusts at themselves; and, although their horses- were gashed and bleeding, they escaped unhurt. Finding it impossible to contend longer with such superior num- bers, they were forced to quit the ground. But instead of flying before the enemy, they dashed forward to meet three British horsemen who were coming up at a gallop. Two of them Custis despatched with his pistols, and the third fell under the sword of Waples. It was done in a minute; and in the next, the diverging party which had despatched the wounded General, as they supposed, had hurried from the field, and the dying Mercer was again surrounded by his own friends, echoing the shouts of victory. "You will see me decently buried," said the young officer Waples had cut down, "when I assure you with my dying breath, that I was going to your assistance. It was my intention to aid you in saving your General from the bayonets of the dastardly men, who had forgotten their duty, and felt none of the generous re- straints of humanity." "Merciful heaven!" cried the young men, dismounting and bending over him, " why did you not tell us your object?" 1.? *     138         THE MONARCHST. "I could not have been heard in the din of conflict. It is useless to regret what is past and irremediable." I "I would give my right arm to save him!" said Waples. "Where is Dr. Craik?" he asked of Colonel Humphries, one of Washington's aids, who approached, followed at a distance by the Commander-in-chief, himself. He is in the rear," said the Colonel. But yonder is Dr. Rush, with poor Mercer. He cannot save him, as he has been run through the body a dozen times, and, as he declares, after he had surrendered." "No surgeon for me!" said the young officer. "It is too late-I am dying!" "Your name?" cried Waples, lifting the gasping youth in his' arms. "Leslie-Captain Leslie-son of the Earl of Leven. Let my father know how I fell. I blame not you." "S My God! I shall be miserable the rest of my days!" cried Waples. "No, generous friend!" said the young man, " you did your duty. Reproach not yourself. Weep not for me. You will bury me decently?" "With the honours of war!" said Washington, who had come up, and witnessed the scene. "Brave young man, it is Washington who speaks to you. It shall be done." "Thanks, thanks, sir! may God bless you, and forgive my sins 1"Soon after he expired in the arms of Waples, who wept over him like a fond brother. And the promise was kept. At the silent hour of night the muffled drum, and the discharge of muskets, announced the burial of the noble and gallant Leslie. The chaplain of his own regiment, who was among the prisoners, led the mournful pro- cession, and uttered the solemn words, "Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live, and is full of misery. He cometh up, and is cut down like a flower," &c. After this ceremony the American army was put in motion, and proceeded on the road to Morristown, where Washington had determined to fix his head-quarters. The tide had now turned completely in favour of the Ameri- cans, although still, as ever, infinitely inferior to the enemy in numbers and discipline. Such sudden blows, and so unexpectedly delivered, greatly alarmed both Lord Cornwallis and General Howe, the British commander-in-chief. Washington had not only clipped one wing of their army, but was destined, it seemed, to bind the other. His movements were eccentric, daring, and f   THE MONARCHST.         ]39 eminently successful. When his enemies confronted him, and supposed they were on the eve of a decisive battle, to be startled by an alarm in their rear, and to find that their reserves were actually defeated, and their communications endangered, was a solecism in military tactics which had not been anticipated, and could not be provided against; for the British generals could not be so well acquainted with the topography of the country as their opponents. The only thing remaining for them to do was to concentrate their scattered forces, and retire with great circum- spection to New Brunswick and Amboy. Thus in a few weeks Jersey was relieved of the presence of the enemy except at those two points. Washington was now greatly strengthened by daily accessions of recruits. The prestige of success was altogether in his favour, and it was his care to maintain his advantage, without risking anything unnecessarily. It was during the pause that ensued while the American army was at Morristown, that Colonel Reed obtained leave to go in quest of his lady. The information he had received at Trenton was quite correct. She had taken refuge in the pines of New Jersey at a remote cottage. Supposing she might return to Philadelphia, where Congress was about to assemble, the Colonel first hastened to the pines; but to no purpose. Being assured that the cottage was still the most secure place she could find, she concluded to stay in New Jersey. She was visiting a friend when her husband called; and he, with precipitation, proceeded to Philadelphia in quest of her. But she had frequently written to her good lord, and was quite as impatient as himself for a meeting. Her letters, however, had fallen into the hands of the enemy, and had been read by many of the British officers, among whom it was a common saying, that if they could only keep the Americans separated from their wives, they might con- quer the country without any very alarming effusion of blood. At Princeton, Master Robert Wales, with the sanction of Washington, and at the secret request of Lord Cornwallis, changed his quarters from the American to the British camp. It was thought at the time, and has been supposed since, that the British army during the winter of 1776-7 acted under some restraint.' No doubt they might have followed Washington over the Delaware, in defiance of all his precautions. He has asserted as much himself. Had they acted with vigour, the American army would have been hopelessly disbanded, all the towns on the seaboard taken, and Congress itself, perhaps, finally dispersed. But it seems they had conceived the idea that the war was near               / a     "O         THE MONARCIIST. its inevitable termination; and if the royal commissioners could effect an accommodation in the existing posture of affairs (as they were assured they might, from divers sources supposed to be reliable), it would be far better to arrest the flames of war within their "present limits, than to extend them further, and perhaps rouse anew in the colonies a. spirit of determined re- sistance. At New Brunswick Lord Cornwallis sent for Master Robert to come to his private room. "Why, sir," said his Lordship, somewhat haughtily, "did you not apprise Rahle of Washington's intended attack upon him at Trenton?" "I did write a note conveying the intelligence. Your Lord- ship may question the bearer, who is within the camp. He was one of the messengers indicated by your Lordship." "Was it Jack Doane?" "It was." His Lordship rang a bell and despatched a servant for Doane, who quickly obeyed the summons. "You were in the American camp before the attack at Trenton?" "Yes, your Lordship." "And Wales gave you a despatch for Colonel Rahle?" "He gave me a pill, and a d-d bitter pill it was!" "You swallowed it, then?" continued Cornwallis, his features relaxing into a smile. "You were taken yourself, of course, before you took the pill?" "Yes, your Lordship, like a rat in a trap, as the man said who caught me. "How was that?" "My saddle had been- thrown into the crib, and the nigger, who did it was gone. I jumped in after it, and the American officer slammed to the door and locked it." "And then you were taken before Washington?" "Yes, your Lordship; and he looked sorrowful to see me in that plight, for I had just brought him a fine fat pig." "Well, they pumped the secret out of you?" "Pumped! They were going to do it. I saw the handle of the thing in the Doctor's handkerchief. They wanted to fix a real suction in my throat! But they didn't. I took the doctor's pill, and his warm, water, and-it makes me sick to think of i! They found some bits of paper. But I heard them say they did not know the writing." "Enough! you may go," said Cornwallis. "Master Robert,"   THE MONARCHST.         141 he continued, "these recent operations of the Americans have injured our cause. I hope you had no hand in them." "If any intelligence I have given you, has been false; or if I have failed to give you any that was desired, through indisposi- tion or neglect, your Lordship may reasonably suspect my fidelity to the cause of his Majesty." "Your reports have been found correct, sir; I must acknow- ledge it; and, it seems, you ate not to blame for the failure of Ddane. But I am not so well assured that you have exerted to the utmost your abilities in behalf of a reconciliation." "Your Lordship may be assured of it. I have omitted no opportunity of urging ai accommodation both in the camp and at Philadelphia, by every argument in my power. The only obstacle seems to be in the limited powers of the commissioners. They must be authorized to acknowledge the power of Congress to treat, before they can expect that body to treat with them." "If that be acknowledged, France will treat with them first." "If it be delayed she will do it, even at the hazard of a war with England; and then farewell to British rule in the colonies. Your Lordship may rest assured, that the longer this step, so necessary, is delayed, the greater will be the difficulty." His lordship paced the room in much vexation. "A few weeks ago," said he, "I was upon the eve of sailing home, with the news that America was subdued. But now, it seems, the work is all to be done over again. It is his Majesty himself who throws the obstacles in the way. An adjustment on the terms demanded by the Americans, could only be humili- ating so far as to involve a change of ministry at home, a few reproachful speeches in parliament, and a sarcasm from Junius; but rather than retrograde an inch, his Majesty ventures every- thing!"  "Your Lordship is perfectly correct," said Wales; "and it is much to be lamented that his .Majesty cannot be made to under- stand the true condition of affairs in these important portions of his dominions." "What does Washington propose?  Does he aspire to be King, or Emperor, as some desire to make him'?" "I have conversed with him fully on that point. He is as ambitious as ever Caesar was, but with this difference; when he shall have beaten all the armies sent to conquer the country, it is his firm purpose to retire from all public employments, and pass the remainder of his days on his quiet farm, under his own vine and fig-tree, as he says. The object is selfishy to luxuriate     "2        THE MONARCIIIST. in the admiration of the world which will be excited on behold- ing such a novel spectacle. I told him as much." "And what did he say!" "He seemed to be offended, but could not positively deny it. He will leave others to model the government, which will be a republic, a democracy, or both blended together, unless two men I could name, are captured, and prevented from com- municating their teeming thoughts to the people." "Will you name them to me?" "Certainly. I mean Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson." "Can they be taken?" "Not easily. But I will undertake the attempt, if, in the pro- gress of the ensuing campaigns, it shall be apparent that his Majesty will not listen to the advice of those best informed in relation to the merits of the dispute, and the probable results of a continuance of this unnatural war. It seems to me he should see the difference between a war on his own subjects and one on the people of India. There, if he fails to conquer, he loses no territory; here, if he conquers, he ruins his own dominions. And he may rouse into existence a power which will hereafter wield a preponderating influence over the monarchies of the world, and involve them all in its ultimate fall, for fall it must, as all re- publics have done." *   THE MONARCHST.         143 CHAPTER XI.

Think of the thorn beneath the rose, The serpent in the flowery path, The deluge of unfathomed woes Ambition nurtures for its wrath! "GHTS were gleaming in the then stately mansion in Chest- nut street, Philadelphia, between Sixth and Seventh streets (where the Arcade now stands), occupied by the widow Graeme and her accomplished daughter, Mrs. Ferguson. The latter, a granddaughter of Sir William Keith, although both from posi- tion and connexions then regarded as neutral, and her family exempted from annoyance by the contending parties which divided the sentiment of the country, was nevertheless, as events proved, not only sincerely attached to the royal cause, but was employed by the British commissioners in sundry intrigues and negotiations. And, being an accomplished diplomatist, fasci- nating in her conversation, and rich, she was enabled to wield an immense influence in the society of Philadelphia, and par- ticularly among the pleasure-seeking members of Congress. Heartily co-operating with Master Robert Wales, Mrs. Fergu- son had no sooner been advised of the total failure of the pro- ject to set up the Stuarts in America, than, in compliance with the suggestions of the diminutive contriver, the approbation of the royal commissioners, then in New York, and even with the sanction of the three Episcopal clergymen, Duch6, Hewitt, and MacCoskie, she resolved to give a series of magnificent enter- tainnments to the representatives of the colonies then assembled in the city. At these splendid parties every ingenuity was to be exerted to consummate, if possible, an accommodation with the King. Of course, the real object of the designing woman was un- known, and even unsuspected, except by the initiated few; for, in reality, the majority of her guests very naturally supposed     "4         THE MONARCHST. the fetes might be in celebration of the recent successes of the American arms in New Jersey, and in the north. Among the initiated were the Kingsburghs, who, with many sad regrets, were forced at last to abandon the idea of seeing Charles seated upon the throne. That inebriate Prince had put his threat in execution, and sailed for Europe, in a fit of rage, and triumphing in the thought that his abandonment of his de- generate subjects would be to them a direful punishment. He had not paused at Philadelphia, nor communicated in any man- ner with his romantic friends, the Kingsburghs. From that moment their allegiance was irrevocably transferred to George III. Hence, it was perceived by Mrs. Ferguson that the once famotis Flora MacDonald, now the loyal subject of King George, might be an effective instrument in the accomplishment of her designs. That when her identity was made known, the curiosity of all parties could not fail to be excited. There would be a general desire to see her, and to converse with her. Her daugh- ter, likewise, so beautiful, so romantic, so zealous and indomita- ble, would contribute largely in diverting the thoughts of the members of Congress from graver subjects. And Miss Custis, who only sighed for peace, and had no disposition to act the champion of either party, or to be a heroine in story, might, even by her silence, seem to approve the cause by an apparent acquiescence. The acquaintance of these ladies, therefore, had been sedulously cultivated, and the premeditated intimacy being successfully established, they had arrived at the mansion, by particular request, long before the great train of visiters had assembled.' At that day there were not many coaches, phaetons, and ca- lashes inbthe city. But all that were in it, found their way, on this momentous occasion, to the mansion of Mrs. Ferguson. First came Andrew Hamilton's coach, then Isaac Norris's, Antony Palmer's, William Peters's, Mrs. Pemberton's, Thomas Willings's, Judge Allen's (driven by an Englishman, and drawn by four black horses), Richard Penn's, a cream-coloured coach, with gildings and carvings, but with nude Cupids painted on the panels (this was afterwards bought by Washington), Mr. Bing- ham's, &c. The Watsons, Shippens, Prestons, Whartons, Brad- fords, Rushes, Ingersols, Sergeants, Chancellers, &c., came in phaetons and calashes. A multitude went on foot; and among them Thomas Jefferson, Edmund Randolph, John Adams, George Wythe, R. H. Lee, and William Pickney, members of Congress. Many other members arrived in the carriages of their friends,   THE MONARCHST.          145 and a very few in their own. Mr. Hancock was one of the few. Even the clergymen were there. Music and dancing, wine and conversation, and even cards, to be followed by a superb feast, formed the programme of the evening's entertainment. Being midsummer, the windows were thrown open, and a great concourse of spectators were assembled in the street, listening to the merry notes of the violin, or gazing at the fair forms which flitted by in the country dances the minuet, and occasionally in the hipsesaw. Among these outside spectators were two individuals who had been closeted that day with Mr. Jefferson for several hours. These were Mr. George Bryan, and a Mr. Carson, formerly a schoolmaster. Ever and anon the latter dropped some detract- ing expression, which met with an approving response from the mob. "There goes Thomas Bradford," said Mr. Carson, aloud, "in his perfumed bag-wig, his satin breeches, and diamond buckles. He professes to be a good whig; and yet they say he has his tea every day, real Bohea, for which he pays twenty-four shillings the pound." "That is non-importation, and non-intercourse, with a ven- geance!" said Mr. Bryan. "Why fight about the tea, if they will still drink it?" asked one. "Half of them are tories," w ththe answer. "As for tea," said a young man by the name of Pearson, whose two beautiful sisters (milliners) had been invited to the party, and himself omitted, "I heard Mrs. Ferguson's own servant say, that what they would pour out of silver coffee-pots to-night, had cost $50 per pound. You may be sure it will not be coffee."  "And yet the members of Congress will be bewitched, and drink it," continued Mr. Bryan. "It may not prove to be so pleasant a night for some of the guests!" said Carson. Bryan and Carson were known to be democrats, and uncom- promising enemies of all persons tinctured with the slightest desire of seeing a reconciliation consummated with the crown. They were evidently not among the crowd in the street merely to satisfy an idle curiosity, for certainly Mr. Bryan had been invited tojoin the revellers within. Hence it was not difficult for them to find greedy ears for the propositions they had to make to the people that night; and to enlist hearty supporters in the enter- prise they had in contemplation. A more fitting moment could 13     "6         THE MONARCHST. not have been selected to rouse the indignation of the common populace against the opulent citizens who were known to be ad- herents of the royal cause, or even against those in whose whig- ism there was strong presumptive evidence of an unsoundness. A committee of Congress had, in accordance with the sugges- tion of Washington, several days before reported a resolution that certain individuals, known or supposed to be in the interest of the enemy, in Philadelphia and elsewhere, should be secured and sent into the interior, or otherwise prevented from doing injury to the cause. Some of these individuals were present at the house of Mrs. Ferguson. But Mr. Bradford, against whom some remarks had been levelled by Mr. Carson, was not one, although believed to be so by the speaker. On the contrary, he was subsequently advanced to a very prominent position by Washington himself. The resolution of the committee had been concurred in by Congress, in secret session; and it was in relation to that mat- ter that Mr. Bryan and Mr. Carson had been in conference with Mr. Jefferson. The revelry within proceeded with an increased animation and enjoyment as. the hours sped rapidly by. Mrs. Ferguson was the centre of the circle from which proceeded the most famous bon-mots. A crowd of curious inquirers encircled Mrs. Kings- burgh, the "old Flora," as some called -her; while a greater number sought the conversation of the more fascinating "young Flora," and her taciturn but self-possessed friend, Miss Ann Custis. But the decided belle of the evening was Miss Franks, the Jewess. She was beautiful, bold, witty, happy, and rich. Her brilliant ideas radiated round like the prismatic lights of a diamond; and none could approach her without being more or less enchanted by the spell that attended her presence. There were likewise many others of superior attractions, daughters of those who had driven thither in their coaches, phaetons, and calashes, and whose influence was felt and appreciated by the vast numbers of strangers from the distant colonies, as well as by. their old admirers. "Rebel or tory, why are you so sad?" asked Miss Franks, turning abruptly to Miss Custis. She had been informed of the cause. "First tell me whether you are a patriot or a royalist," said Miss Custis, in a composed voice; ' in these perilous times, it is not always prudent to open one's heart without knowing the sentiments of the beholder." "Then in truth I cannot tell you, because I do not know,   THE MONARCHST.         147 myself. I do not want to know; in short I will not decide, so I cannot know. I will be either, neither, or both. And I shall not leave the city if the British should take it, as they say they will this year. But why so sad?" "I am not sad," said Miss Custis, now laughing heartily. "Her heart was only absent," said Miss Kingsburgh. "And away to the wars?" "I suppose so." "It must have been in the American camp, then; for we American ladies have not yet had the happiness to become ac-: quainted with the noble gallants recently sent over to subdue us. One noble youth, of whom I had heard much in commendation, has fallen on the way. I could weep for him." "And you never saw him. What was his name?" "Captain Leslie son of the Earl of Leven,"- continued Miss Franks. "The manner of his fall makes me pity him. He was riding up to where the British soldiers, butchers! were bayonet- ing poor General Mercer, to drive them away; and it was upon this mission of mercy that he was met by an officer from Vir- ginia and run through the body. The Virginian, of course, did not know his intention; indeed he may have believed the soldiers were executing his victim's orders; but still it was a melancholy occurrence. He died in the arms of the victor, who, they say, wept like a child over his fallen enemy." "What was the name of the Virginian?" asked Miss Custis, evincing unusual interest in the recital. "Waples," said Miss Franks. a Ah, me!" said Miss Custis, closing her eyes and pressing her hand on her breast. The next instant she was insensible, having fallen into the arms of Miss Franks.  When the confusion attendant upon this occurrence, not an unusual one in those days, had subsided, and Miss Custis had been conveyed in Mrs. Ferguson's carriage to her home (still at Mrs. Darrah's), the gayety and enjoyment continued without abatement, "It was too cruel," said Mrs. Ferguson to Miss Franks, "to find her heart in that manner. You found more than you sought." "Yes; her sweet-heart. Heigh-ho! I wonder if I shall ever find my own?" At that instant a tremendous thunderbolt shook the house to its foundations. The music and the dance ceased. Half-uttered sentences remained unfinished. Giddy laughter was checked mid- way in its utterance. Even Mr. Jefferson, who was engaged in     "5         THE MONARCHST. an animated discussion with the clergymen, remained silent, with his hand extended. Hardly had the revels recommenced, when a servant entered and whispered something in the ear of Mrs. Ferguson, which caused her to turn very pale. She arose andlfollowed the servant to the spacious saloon which was to be the scene of the final act of the festivity. Upon witnessing the picture there pre- sented, her blood seemed to freeze with horror. The coffee pots of silver (in which the tea was really to be made), and all the spoons, had been melted by the lightning!   / But even such a mishap was not to deter a fashionable woman, on such an occasion, from the pursuit of her object. Other plate was procured, and the awful circumstance was not even so much as mentioned to any of the guests that night. Mrs. Ferguspn returned to her company with as sweet a smile as ever, and with a vivacity of speech which seemed to have been rather stimulated than depressed by the miraculous occurrence. "Ah, Colonel!" cried she, to Washington's disconsolate aid, who had just arrived, "where do you come from?  Happy, happy are we to see you!" "He dropped down from the clouds," said Miss Franks. "Did you not hear the announcement of his arrival a few minutes ago? Jupiter himself could not have been preceded by a louder clap of thunder." "I thought it would annihilate me," said Reed; "But, madam-" he continued, hesitating, " have you seen anything, or heard anything of my wife?" "No, to my sorrow! I hoped to see her here. Is she not at the cottage in the pines?" "No; I have been there; she had left the week before. And no one could tell me whither she had gone!" "She is seeking for you," said Miss Franks. "I have no doubt of it," said Colonel Reed; " but the envious Fates seem to conspire against us-" "To keep you separated!" said Miss Franks. Dr. Kearsley approached, and was in the act of addressing some question to the Colonel, when a note was put into his hand. He looked at it closely, lifted his eyes, and then scrutinized the paper again, in doubt and agitation. "Never mind me, Doctor," said the Colonel; "attend to your patients." "Do, Doctor," said Miss Franks, " while you have them; the Colonel has no patience."   "No patience?" he cried; "in the name of reason, have I not waited-" "But not patiently!" interrupted Miss F. With something like a reluctant effort Dr. Kearsley withdrew. He was met in the street not far from the door of the mansion by some of the leaders of the outside multitude. The recogni- tion was mutual. The recent cloud had passed away, and the full moon shone down in meridian brightness. "Doctor," said one of the leaders, passing his arm through his, "we have a duty to perform, and rather a painful one. The honest citizens have decided that they must have some species of amusement to-night, as well as the nabobs. In short, through me, their organ, they desire to know whether you will, or will not, deny the King's authority?" "I have no reply, sir, for impertinent interrogatories 1" said the doctor. "You will not deny that you are .a tory, doctor?" cried seve- ral of his old acquaintances. It was not denied. It was not deniable. And the next moment the doctor was hoisted into a cart drawn by a jackass, accompanied by various inscriptions emblematical of the subjects in agitation at the time, and of the public sentiment. The mob hooted and yelled; and at every pause the doctor, who had become hopelessly enraged at the indignity offered him, poured forth a volley of imprecations on the heads of his per- secutors. The police, and even Captain Cowperthwait's "Quaker Blues" (a company of volunteers-young Quakers-who had de- termined to fight for liberty in spite of their parents, and the old women), who were out in full force, looked on with approbation or indifference. It had all been preconcerted., The more the doctor vented his execrations, the more the mob hooted. Becoming at length angered themselves, they'threw-dirt and eggs at him, and having proclaimed him a tory and traitor in all the principal streets, they finally released him at his own door, where he vanished, still uttering his curses. Their next victim, who was likewise withdrawn from the festive scene without causing the slightest disturbance within, was Mr. Isaac Hunt, as decided a royalist as any one could be. They placed him in the same cart. "Now, gentlemen," said he, standing up boldly, "give me an easy ride." "Why, he don't curse, and foam at the mouth," said one of the mob.  13*     150        THE MONARCHST. "No; I shall only laugh at you. I shall die laughing, if you kill me. Three cheers for the King!" and he gave them. "Whip up the jack!" cried the mob. "But find a smooth road," said Hunt, "and I shall be obliged to you. I shall enjoy this ride hugely, and laugh at it all my days." "There is no use in carting him!" said many voices; "he likes it. Let him go; there's humour in him." And that sentiment prevailing, he was immediately released. But the diversions within and without were not to terminate thus. Captain Cadwalader's company,.in green uniform, with silk stockings, were paraded in Independence Square; and Cap- tain Forest's company, in Indian costume, were on duty in High street, preparatory to obey an order from the Commander-in-chief, in pursuance of a resolution of Congress. Mistakes were inevitable in the execution of orders for the removal of disaffected citizens, and they were &doubtless com- mitted in all the colonies. Philadelphia was not exempt from them; among those supposed to be inimical to Congress, were included citizens who afterwards- proved to be the firm advocates of independence. That night Messrs. Chew, Tilghman, Shippen, John Penn, Pemberton, Allen, Fisher,'Pike, the fencing-master, and many others, who had been present at the entertainment of the evening, were quietly invited out of the house, ne at a time, and put under arrest. Some of them were subsequently sent off to the western part of Virginia, to keep company with the Hessian prisoners. The eagle eye of Jefferson marked every movement, and danced with delight when he ascertained that none of the monarchists who were called out returned again. Nor did these things escape the notice of Mrs. Ferguson. She had spies and agents everywhere. But it was not her policy to remonstrate, or even to seem to perceive what was taking place. She had been selected to operate upon the minds of great men, whose opinions and actions would influence the con- duct of multitudes; and it was neither her duty to bestow attention upon isolated characters not invested with public trusts, nor her inclination to interfere with the subordinate operations of the government or the army. She had, perhaps, at the time we refer to, a more accurate knowledge of the intentions of General Howe, as well as of those of his brother, Lord Howe, who commanded the naval forces in America, than any one in Philadelphia, or even in the   THE MONARCIIIST.         151 American army. The British army, after leaving sufficient force in New York to protect the city, had embarked on board the ships of war, and no one knew, *who was not in the secrets of the enemy, their destination. The means of transporting themselves at pleasure by sea from one field of operations to another, was one of the most decided advantages the enemy possessed; and the only wonder is that they did not realize greater results from it. Washington was completely at a loss to conjecture what point would be selected- as the next scene of invasion. For a long time he felt a conviction that Philadelphia was the object; but circumstances transpired to induce the belief that Boston would be again assailed. He had received intelligence from Culper junior (Wales+, stating that the British themselves had not determined upon their course; but had sailed with sealed in- structions from Lord George Germain, Secretary of State for America, to be opened when at sea. The American Commander-in-chief, deeming, it unnecessary to be marching from one extremity of the country to the other to oppose the landing of the enemy, when he could procure no information in relation to the direction they had taken, deter- mined to remain quietly in -his central position and await the event. If he were to march to the north or to the south, the fleet might return, and there would be no opposition in New Jersey or other barrier to prevent the British from marching, which might be accomplished in two or three days, from Amboy to Philadelphia. It was about the time of the magnificent entertainment given by Mrs. Ferguson and her mother (the cost of which was defrayed from the military chest of the British army), that Washington had heard, by means of expresses established for the purpose, of the hostile fleet being seen off the capes of Delaware, and hence the activity and vigilance exercised by the agents of government in Philadelphia. But it seemed that no sooner was the army put in motion than another express brought news of the fleet having sailed away again without their final course being ascertained. Then there was halting and countermarching, and a relaxation of the rigorous measures adopted in regard to the tories. Washington's correspondence at this time was most astonish- ingly voluminous. Undoubtedly he laboured quite as assiduously as he could have done in the presence of the enemy. Every con- ceivable precaution was recommended by him, to provide for any emergency. But why had the fleet sailed away from the mouth of the Delaware? Was their appearance there a feint, to draw     152         THE MONARCHST. the American forces in that direction, so that they might find less resistance in landing at Boston? It seemed probable; and again the American general was at a loss to know towards which section of the country he ought to turn his arms. He did the only proper thing for a wise commander to do in such an emergency. He expanded his army north and south, still main- taining his communications, and having in view the practicability of concentrating the whole on either the right, the left, or the centre, and thus be enabled to move with expedition in any direc- tion which occasion might require. At length the Briitsh fleet was again heard from (being in the Chesapeake Bay), after an inexplicable absence from the coast for many days; and although the intentions of the enemy were not yet distinctly pronounced, for Richmond or Balimore might be their object, yet sufficient was known to render necessary the approach of the American army to Philadelphia. Subsequent expresses, however, soon brought the startling information that withoat turning to the left towards Richmond, or pausing to re- duce Baltimore, the enemy had sailed directly to the head of Elk, whence an uninterrupted march by land might bring them, in two or three days, to Philadelphia. But they were not to ap- proach without opposition. And thus, after all their manoeuvring and mystery, they were to be confronted by Washington and the American army, such as it then wasj under his command.     THE MONARCHST.         153 CHAPTER XII.

Come as victors to the revel  When the bloody work is done, He who bids you is the devil, And will reap whate'er be won. MAP ToM's MUSE. NEVER before had Philadelphia been a scene of so pervading an excitement. The British were landing at the head of Elk river some fifteen thousand men, and Washington was approaching the city, through which he must pass to oppose them, with the Ame- rican army. A battle was inevitable, and the retention or loss of the city was to be the immediate result of the combat And the population was much divided in sentiment between the con- tending parties. Long before the hour appointed for the marching of the Ime- rican army through the city, thousands of citizens were lining the sidewalks of Front street, which had been designated as the route, or crowding the windows, in eagerness to behold the Com- mander-in-chief, and those he led to the defence of the city. Some were to utter prayers for the success of the Americans, and others to invoke secretly a blessing on the royal cause. Whichever side might triumph, there were to be many saddened hearts and blighted hopes. Such must ever be the fruits of civil war. At the house of J. D. Coxe, Esq., in Front street, in the second story front room were assembled the Kingsburghs, Miss Custis, Miss Franks, Mrs. Ferguson, Mrs. Darrah, Miss Hassel, and several other ladies. The gentlemen attending them were the three clergymen, Messrs. Duch6, Hewitt, and MacCoskie; Mr. Darrah, the Quaker schoolmaster, Mr. Kingsburgh, and divers young gentlemen, the fashionable beaux of the city. There was. a solitary member of Congress present-Thomas Jefferson. Although a great many pale faces might be seen in the street,     154         THE MONARCHST. and other indications of the existence of an intense anxiety and painful apprehension, experienced throughout the city, yet one would not have supposed, from the visages and conversation of most of the party in the house of Mr. Coxe, that they entertained any presentiment of an impending calamity. They seemed rather to anticipate the enjoyment of a fine pageant; and their remarks on the appearance and peculiarities of the dense crowd below, eagerly staring up the street, in momentary expectation of seeing the head of the approaching host of warriors, resembled the casual criticisms of a gay party witnessing some civic procession. "Yonder they come!" cried an urchin below, in the middle of the street; and the next moment all eyes were turned in the direction, and beheld only a cloud of dust. Immediately afterwards a man in citizen's dress galloped down the street, and announced, to the chagrin of the thousands who were upon the tiptoe of expectation, that the dust was occasioned by an approaching drove of beeves! But he said the soldiers were not far behind; that they kept in sight of their rations; and he desired the crowd to stand back and. leave ample space for them all to pass. "They say Washington's army is twenty thousand strong. Is it so?" asked Mrs. Ferguson, addressing Mr. Duche. "I think not, madam," replied the reverend gentleman. "But Mr. Jefferson might, if it be no secret of state, inform you of the precise number of troops destined to vanquish the host of Sir William." General Howe had received the red rib- bon from his Majesty. "The smaller the number, the more famous the victory," said the great statesman, smiling. "But victory is not to perch on the banners of rebellion," said Miss Flora. "No; it did not at Culloden," said Miss Franks. "But did it not at Trenton and Princeton?" asked Miss Custis. "And to your sorrow," said Miss Franks. "And to my sor- row, for I have bitterly regretted having mentioned one circum- stance attending the last-named engagement. I pray you forgive me!"Ann smiled slightly, and pressed the tendered hand. "The victory is not to the strong, nor the race to the swift," said Mr. Jefferson, glancing at MacCoskie, whom he sometimes led into a controversial discussion, merely to witness the reverend gentleman's uncontrollable ebullitions of temper. "Certainly not," said MacCoskie; "when God espouses the   THE MONARCHST.    '     15i:  side of the weak. But, sir, I have to learn, and would be most happy to know, that you reposed a confiding reliance in the promises of holy writ. I regard the King-as the anointed ser- vant of God, to rule his people in the temporal concerns of life; and hence, I cannot conceive how one may suppose that God will give the victory to the weak, in this instance, when 'the stronger party are the avowed champions of his will." ,?: "It has been the same hitherto," continued Jefferson; "ever since the was began, Washington has been leading the weaker party; and yet his triumphs have been undeniable. He cer- tainly believes, for he has declared it a hundred times,.that the hand of Providence has been repeatedly interposed in his behalf, and in behalf of the country. You know this to be so, Mr. Duch6." "True, sir," replied that gentleman; "but I would rather ascribe his success to his own merits, and the purity of his own heart, than to the justice of the cause he upholds. It may be, as I trust the event will prove, that God has only given him success to enable him to consummate a more enduring peace, that greater fraternal concord may be established between the two countries." "You are in error," said Jefferson. "Washington, I venture to assert, is one of the most uncompromising advocates of com- plete and final separation, to be found anywhere on the continent; and he relies with confidence upon the assistance of Divinity itself to crown his efforts to that end with triumph. And al- though he is now really at the head of no more than eleven thousand effective men, with which he must oppose the progress of some fifteen or sixteen thousand, you will see him pass with the firm bearing of a Roman general, who never contemplates the possibility of being entirely overthrown and destroyed. Even if he be defeated, you will see him return with the same confident brow. And, in his mind (and mine too), the circum- stance of a defeat at this juncture, might be fraught with no ultimate injury to the American cause." "Why not?" asked Mrs. Ferguson. "I have been led to be- lieve it would be followed by immediate submission." "I will tell you why," said Jefferson, smiling, " since we are all friends, and heartily embarked in the same cause. Great Britain has a powerful neighbour in Europe, quite as much her foe as we are. That neighbour never did, and never will, neglect an opportunity to wound her ancient enemy and rival. If we succeed in severing the empire with our own arms, it will be well I.-     156         THE MONARCHST. ' done, and she will applaud us; if we fail, and are likely to be subdued, she will come to our assistance immediately with her fleets and armies. Washington is aware of this; and hence he  believes God himself has so disposed circumstances that we must  be free and independent."  "If the result should be as he supposes and wishes" said I MacCoskie, "it will not be the work of God!"'       i! "Not?" said Jefferson; " whose, then, will it be?"  "It will be the work of the devil!" replied the reverend gen  tleman, with warmth. "And it will not prosper; it cannot  a endure. For more than a thousand years the unchained evil one  has been engaged stirring up animosity and strife between Eng-  land and France. Those kingdoms have been his choicest harvest fields, and there is an hereditary hatred, deep and ineradicable, subsisting between them. And is success here to be the fruit of A this uncharitableness, the result of this wicked animosity, and to be denominated the production of the beneficent ruler of the universe?- No! It would, I say, be the work of the devil! And  future ages would lament the day when the seed of such misery, as would inevitably ensue, were sown!"  "Now they come!" was heard from a hundred voices. And soon after Washington, surrounded by his staff, and followed by the army, all neatly, at least cleanly dressed for the occasion, preceded and followed by music, and accompanied by flaunting banners, were beheld approaching at a brisk pace. As far as the eye could reach the long street was filled with armed men, and lumbering artillery carriages. A deafening shout from the extensive line of spectators seemed to welcome the brave defenders of the country, who moved on- ward with a spirit and agility, that indicated their eagerness to meet the invaders. Washington rode hat in hand, bowing to the right and left, with: a benevolent smile struggling for ascendancy over the habi- tual gravity of his features. He was in the full meridian of life, and in the utmost vigour of manhood, both in regard to mental and physical capacity. He rode erect, and gracefully, on a proud horse, which seemed to be conscious that the one he bore was the centre of attraction. But yet there was perceptibleanimpatience and hurried eager-  ness both among the offeiers and the men, which was rightly in- terpreted as a never-absent conviction that they were not then merely parading for an idle display. Before they could enjoy the plaudits and gratitude of the multitude in their full extent, they had many duties to perform; much work-and bloody work--   TL' Ei LvlUJNA I CH.1S'T'.   1 u4 to do. And so recognitions and parting words were hastily des- patched. The handkerchief of Mrs. Ferguson had attracted the notice of Colonel Reed, as the staff-some distance in advance of the column-halted in front of the house occupied by our party. He drew the attention of Washington 'in that direction, and all at the windows had the satisfaction of receiving the pointed notice of the Commander-in-chief, amid the stirring music which prevented any words from being uttered, save the occasional or- ders that were transmitted by stentorian lungs along the serried ranks behind. Colonel Reed was seen immediately after to incline towards Washington, and to receive an affirmative nod from his superior. The next moment he was, accompanied by two young officers, dismounted at the curb-stone. Throwing their reins to the score of hands voluntarily held forth to receive them, the three officers, pushing as well as they were able through the crowd, entered the hall of the house, and proceeded with haste to mount the stairs. Upon seeing Custis and Waples dismount, Ann had convul- sively risen and retired into an adjoining room in the rear. She was followed by Flora, who witnessed her agitation, and who was determined that the lovers should meet, for, it might be, the last time. When the officers entered, the two youngest, on looking round and perceiving that Ann had withdrawn, paused in embarrass- ment. "Ah, here is Jupiter, again!" said Miss Franks; "but shorn of his thunder. Yet, perhaps, his bolts are reserved for the enemy. We shall expect a mighty explosion down in Delaware." "One, I trust," said the Colonel, rather gravely, "' which will injure none but the enemy." "But say, my gallant Colonel, has Apollo yet found his Daphne? No! I see the chase has been in vain! Your looks confess it." "Too true!" said he; "I have heard from her, but not met with her. To-morrow she will be at the place I appointed for the meeting yesterday. An accident to the carriage was the cause of her delay. And now it is too late-too late, perhaps, for ever!" "No, no, no " said Miss Franks; "the gods and god- desses are immortal. Have patience." "Patience!" echoed the Colonel. "At least, if you be not destined to recover the lost one," "     158         THE MONARCHST. said Mrs. Ferguson, " before, like Daphne, she be turned by the gods to a laurel, you can, at all events, crown your head as Apollo did with her leaves." "He has had enough of her leaves, I fancy," said Miss Franks. "And at last he is leaving her!" said Mrs. Ferguson, who had had some agency in prolonging the apparently accidental separation of the husband and wife, who really adored each other. "And now I may bring him in?" asked Flora, who had, after the expenditure of much eloquence, obtained the consent of Ann to see Waples. "4 Yes; but not alone. My brother Thomas must accompany him; and you, too, must be present." The next moment the young officers were led into the room to which Ann had retired. Ann, by a violent effort, had removed the traces of her recent tears, and struggled to assume an air of indifference. But she was very, very pale, and trembled slightly, after saluting her brother. "I am going to quit the army," said Waples, holding the seemingly reluctant hand which he had taken. "You are, indeed?" said she, quickly, while a beautiful bloom suddenly tinged her cheek. "Yes; I have Washington's consent to do so-as soon as this enterprise is over, which may be in a few days." Ann's eyes fell, and the rose was changed to a lily. "Yes; it may be all over with you in a few days," said Flora. "We have a great army now," said Custis, "and the recruits seem eager to be led to battle." "And will be the first to fly," said Flora. "Never fear that!" said he. "But, sister Ann," he con- tinued, " is there no news from the Eastern Shore?" "Oh yes," said Ann, withdrawing her hand from Waples, and assuming again an air of composure, "I have had several letters. The Squire has had his periodical attack of the gout, and, as usual, has interdicted the visits of the physician during its con- tinuance. He says it is a remedy for all other diseases, and it would be worse than nonsense to cure it, if indeed it be susceptible of cure." "But what of the other people-the ladies, for instance?" Fanny and your brother Robinson own that they are very happy." "But--but, how-" "Oh, I understand: Miss Luker has been ill. Two years ago,   THE MONARCHST.         159 when in Williamsburg, she became acquainted with a noble young British officer-she formed no attachment-he was already affianced at home-whom she esteemed highly as a friend. The news of his death, last winter, shocked her, and was followed by the illness, from which she has not yet entirely recovered." "And pray who was that officer?" "Perhaps I had better not name him." "No!" said Flora. "It was the fortune of war-and can do no good." "Permit me to insist on it," said Custis. "Then it was Captain Leslie!" Waples shuddered-and Custis fixed his eyes upon him with an expression almost of ferocity. I hoped, gentlemen," said Ann, " that ere this you would have been sated with the horrors of war. I was mistaken." "And particularly with the horrid crime of combating the forces of their King," said Flora. "I know not which side is right," said Ann; "and will not be classed with the adherents of either party. My only desire is to return to ViSinia and live in peace." "That is impofible, now," said Waples. "I know, it sir;" said she. "But the moment it is practi- cable, I will hasten to realize my desire." "And may not I hope to accompany you thither?" said Waples. "I think not, sir. Much bloody work, I am told, is to be done remotely as well as immediately; and your very valuable services may not be dispensed with." "Cruel Ann!" said Waples. I thought cruelty was the prbperty of the one who slaughtered his fellow men; of the one who perhaps does it for the mere enjoyment of the excitement." "Upon my life you greatly err. If you could only hear Washington speak, and see the tears roll down his already fur- rowed face, while describing the distresses of the people who have submitted to the rule of the enemy, you would not blame me for aiding him in driving back from our shores the heartless invaders. Why, in Jersey the British have burned the houses of whigs and tories alike, and the poor little children were driven out in the snow, in their bare feet ^" "Horrible!" exclaimed Ann and Flora. "But farewell!' said Waples, "for only a few days, I trust. We must meet the enemy once more, and then I hope the war will be ended."     160        THE MONARCHST. "And America returned to its allegiance," said Flora. "Under which King?" asked Custis, smiling. "George III.," said Flora. "No longer is there a Stuart (the rightful race) fit to reign over us. But I must not omit to caution you against meeting one who is with Sir William Howe." "Who is that?" "Don't insist," said she, archly. "Indeed I must; else how shall I avoid him?" Percy, then!" "I cannot promise to avoid an enemy," said Custis. "And he, above all others," said Waples. "Have you learned positively that he is with the British army landed at the head of Elk?" "Yes." "Say you have it under his own hand" added Ann, "that they may doubt no longer." "I doubt it not," said Waples, rather fiercely; "but why caution us not to meet him? Is he an object of fear?" "You might wound another by striking him," said Ann. "And that might stimulate one's arm to ike the harder!" said Waples.  "As you like, sir;" said Ann. "It is no especial matter of mine; and if it was, I do not see what influence that fact could have." "Pardon me," said Waples, his voice falling; "I see whose matter it is," he continued, marking the recent flush fading from Flora's cheek. "And I here promise that if I see him in peril," he added aloud, "I will use my best endeavours to save him." "I thank you, sir!" said Ann, and her manner expressed her earnestness. Being summoned away by the Colonel, the young men, after a hasty leave-taking, departed. When the army had passed by, our party descended to the street, and slowly wended their way to their several homes. Mr. Jefferson accompanied Miss Franks as far as his hotel, where he resigned her entirely to Messrs. Powel and Gilpin, her young admirers. Norah Hassel was likewise of the party, and the gal- lant statesman handed her into the parlour of the inn. Mr. Duch6 waited upon Mrs. Ferguson, while the other clergyman accompanied the party that returned to Mrs. Darrah's mansion. And gallantry aside, it was quite requisite for the ladies to have protection that day; for the streets seemed to contain the entire ton-combating population; and there were besides many rough strangers, whose faces were not only not familiar, but whose bold   THE MONARCHST.          161 remarks and insolent bearing, afforded evidence of their desperate nature, and equivocal intentions. When the soldiery had with- drawn from the city, most of the shops were closed, and prepar- ations were generally made, both by whig and tory, to secure whatever was most valuable and most liable to be seized in the pillage which had been repeatedly threatened by the profligate 4:i  and reckless of both parties. I   But unheeding or oblivious of the dangers so generally ap- prehended and deprecated, Friend Darrah and Kingsburgh loitered on the way, and even diverged from the most direct route. The latter, under the pretext of procuring a glass of wa- ter, paused a few moments at the "Cross-Keys," and had not neglected to mix it with rum, while his companion waited patiently without.  "Now, friend Donald, as thee is refreshed," said Darrah, "we will resume our projects for the future, and if thee has no objec- tion, we may as well continue our walk up Chestnut street." "Very well, friend -Darrah," said Kingsburgh; "and as we proceed I will tell you truly a piece of my mind. I think it would become mgietter to buckle on a sword, and do service for our King, than to be idling here." "Thee must not think so. The sword is an instrument of violence, and was fabricated to shed man's blood; and whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed. No; let us study how to live, and to live well; The libraries I have been speaking to thee about will all be established." Let them be; and I hope they may do much good. But I shall not be a door-keeper." "Door-keeper! I tell thee the places will be mere sinecures. Thee can have deputies to attend to the business for one-eighth the salary. Why, friend, I can tell thee a secret." I   "What is it, man?" "All the Scotchmen in the city are already applying for the places; and Dr. Witherspoon is recommending two or three him- self." "No matter, friend Darrah. I have notions more exalted. To be sure, some of my countrymen become important in such positions, and think themselves wise by reflection; when, if they could realize the fact that they are but the dim shadows attend- ant upon the creations of great men's minds, there would be more humility and kindness in their behaviour. The sun is sultry, and these soldiers have filled the city with dust. Pause here a moment, friend Darrah, while I refresh myself with another glass of water." "*     162        THE MONARCHST. And saying this, he entered the "Half-M3oon," opposite the State-house, and swallowed more rum. "Now," said he, when he had rejoined his companion, "I feel greatly refreshed. I will tell you now, friend Darrah, why I decline your tempting librarianships, which might be worth some- thing some half century hence. You must know, if you do not already, and nearly the whole world knows it, that my good wife is a heroine, and that our daughter is to be another. We are great folks, sir; and our likenesses done on copper, are in the printshops of London and Paris. But that is not all. When Flora was taken a prisoner to London, she was visited by many of the noblest ladies in the kingdom, and the bank notes, jewels, and plate they showered upon her amounted in value to 3000." "Indeed! Donald!" exclaimed Darrah. "Yes, indeed; but unfortunately the most of it has been spent by Mrs. Kingsburgh. But then, if this country is to be turned into a throat-cutting democracy, we can return home, and no doubt our old friends will remember us. And between you and re, a pension has been promised me. I have served one tour under King George in North Carolina and Viinia, according to agreement, and the ministry must fulfil their promise when I return." "But, friend Donald, are you not a Jacobite?" "I would be, if there was a Stuart fit to reign; and then I would be a lord; but, being a family of note in the history of England, our loyalty to George III. will have its influence, and is worth paying for." "Now thee is talking politics, which I don't understand, friend Donald. If it were not politics, such buying and pensioning would be called by ugly names." "Friend Darrah, what does that mean?" asked his companion, pointing to a spectacle on the opposite side of the street, which was well calculated to attract notice, even from one of less uncer- tain vision. It was a gentleman of portly dimensions walking along the street, under a huge umbrella, then a rare article, borne by a negro at his side. "That, Donald, is Mr. Bingham, the rich man. His boy always carries the umbrella over him, in rain or shine, when he walks." "And that is putting the negroes to baser uses than they do in the south. I never saw anything like it in North Carolina or Virginia. Nevertheless, it is excessively sultry to-day, and I have an inclination to turn up Tenth street, as far as louquet's Inn, where they keep excellent water."   THE MONARCHST.         163 i   "I am thirsty, myself, friend Donald; and will partake with thee this time." "If I thought it would be no offence, friend Darrah," con- tinued Kingsburgh, "I would also invite you to partake with me of a wee drop of something stronger than water. This is a sort of holiday-time with you, as most of your scholars have been sent to the interior, and you might taste some little enjoyment." I  "It will not offend me, friend Donald; but I would not be seen to enter the inns nearer home. Thee understands?" "Oh, perfectly! Why, we will make a glorious day of it!" By this time they had reached the inn at the corner of Tenth and Cherry streets, which was immediately patronized by them with a hearty good-will. When they were about to enter the street again, which was but little more than a road at that day, for the houses were few and far between, a side door opened, and Friend Darrah started back in amazement, on beholding one of his oldest patrons stand- ing before him. It was Mr. Galloway, the Quaker lawyer, formerly a member of Congress, and now a decided tory, sojourn- ing, incognito, in the city. "Come in, come in, friend William, I heard your friend's toast to King George, and will forgive you for drinking it with him." They entered the small dark room. Upon learning who Kings- burgh was, Galloway expressed much delight in making his ac- quaintance. "I must tell thee frankly," said Darrah, in a low tone, " if thee is seen by any of the friends of the Congress, thee will be seized, and peradventure hung." "I will take care not to be seen for a few days, my good friend," said Galloway; "after that time I will walk the streets as boldly as any other man." I  "What makes thee think so?" I  "I know so. Philadelphia, by that time, will be in the posses- sion of his Majesty's troops." "Long life to George III.!" cried Kingsburgh; "by the grace of God, King of Great Britain, Ireland, America-" "Hold, friend!" exclaimed Galloway, placing his hand on Kingsburgh's mouth. "Be quiet!" said the bar-tender, looking'in, and then vanish- ing. Galloway, seeing that Darrah's Scotch companion was ,becom-e ing too energetic from his potations to be quite prudent in his Galwy eigta       arhs cthcmainwsbcm     164         THE MONARCHST. remarks, dismissed them, with cautions to be silent in regard to his presence, and with promises to remember their loyalty when the royal cause should be triumphant. They returned to Chestnut street, which was becoming more and more a scene of confusion. Men, women, and children were hurrying in different directions, bearing many burdens, with which they were leaving the city. If the British came, the families of obnoxious whigs might suffer; if America con- quered, those of the tories would be the victims. And hence numbers of both classes lost no time in providing for either al- ternative. When our friends, now grown quite merry, reached the corner of Ninth and Chestnut streets, Kingsburgh felt an irresistible desire to travel southward, and indulged it. But as they turned the corner they were confronted by John Roberts and Abram Carlisle, quakers, and notorious tories. "Why, thee looks red in the face!" said the former to Darrah, who was the teacher of his children. "Do I, John? Well, thee must knowI have been drinking a spiritual toast to the King."' "Thee is excusable for that!" said Abram, in a low voice, looking round to see if he was observed by any whig. "Who has thee there?" asked John, nodding to Kingsburgh. Donald overheard him, and answered for himself: "Iam one who can say, and am not afraid to say, and do say, God bless King George-and may he long live to reign over us!" "Hold, friend!" exclaimed the tories. "Thee is too bold; thee may not live thyself to see much of the King's reign, if thee is so imprudent." The brace of tories lost no time in separating themselves from such joyous companions. But the perambulations of our brace of loyalists were not to be without other interruptions. When they were ascending the steps of the Blue-house Tavern, at the corner of Ninth and South streets, they were accosted by Dr. La Mayeur,-the dentist. He requested to have a few words with Darrah, stating that what he wished to communicate might be of very great advantage to him. "Well, friend," said Darrah, stepping aside with him, what is it thee wishes to say?" "De sound front teet, all de world know, prix ixe, is two guinea." "Friend, thee would not have me sell thee my front teeth, surely? All the rest are gone; how could I bite my biscuit?" Vous ne concevez pas! I do not mean votre teet. Voila!"   vK!       TTHE MONARCHST.        165 he continued; displaying in his handkerchief, which he drew from his pocket, some half dozen instruments for extracting teeth. "Wid dese, von might, could, or should be able to pull out von mille, thousand, de teet in von hour. Den wid mille thousand, in von's pocket, est deux mille, thousand guinea!" "All that is very true, by the arithmetic, friend Monsieur; but where could so many people be found to sit down quietly and let one pull out their front teeth?" "Ah! Je tell you von grand secret! Dere is von grand bat- taile vill be fought. De morts, de dead, vill have use no more for dere teet. Comprenez vous?" "Friend!" said Darrah, starting back in horror, " would thee have me turn hyena? Must I feed upon the carcasses of the dead? My friend, you insult me!" "By gar! demandez-vous satisfaction?" "No, friend. I turn to the right; do thou turn to the left." And Darrah, quite sobered by the frightful thought which had been imparted to him by the dentist, hastened to rejoin his com- panion. But Monsieur La Mayeur was not the one to abandon a grand idea. Teeth at that day, at least handsome front ones, were readily sold for two guineas a piece, and were transplanted by the dentists, who inserted them in the places whence they ex- tracted decayed ones. Many a fashionable lady bore in her mouth the teeth of individuals who dwelt in obscurity, or reposed in the grave-yard. When Darrah turned away in disgust, La Mayeur beckoned aside Kingsburgh, and made the same proposition to him. It was rejected with the same disdain and horror,-and the doctor (for he was a doctor) as was his custom in such cases, tendered the usual satisfaction. In Kingsburgh, however, he had not found a non-combatant. The indignant and intoxi- cated Scotchman no sooner heard the words uttered, than he levelled the Frenchman with his fist, and actually knocked out one of his faultless teeth. (Dentists themselves have faultless teeth.) "Here, man!" cried Kingsburgh, picking up the tooth, "what will you give me for this?" Several persons had come out from the tavern, who now stood in the vicinity and enjoyed the enter- tainment. "By gar!" said the Doctor, as well as he was able, "je paid tree guinea pour dat. Je bought it de von charmant mademo- selle in Londres! Je vill make vous von prosecution! Je vous deimand one mille, thousand dollar!"     166        TIIE MONARCHST. "See here, monsure," said a countryman, from the neighbour. hood of the city, "you had better go home, or you may lose all your fine teeth. No doubt you wanted to hire these gentlemen to do the same horrible thing you proposed to me. Take my advice, and retire." i' He did, friend," said Darrah. "He wanted us to pull the teeth out of the mouths of the dead men bn the field of battle." "Oui! le morts, le dead peoples, have no use for der teet! Monsieur will have le complasaince to return my toot?" "Yes, man!" said Kingsburgh. "But never provoke another by your infamous proposals to rob the dead. Take your tooth!" And saying this, he returned the incisor to its owner, and then proposed to treat the whole company at the bar of the inn. It was late in the evening when friend Darrah succeeded in getting the face of Kingsburgh finally turned towards home. And Darrah's own step was somewhat unsteady. They entered in a manner to startle the whole neighbourhood as well as the ladies in the house. Kingsburgh would sing; and the selections he made were all of the Jacobite or royalist complexion. He was only quieted when Mrs. Kingsburgh stood before him, with rather a reproachful look than a frown. She did not utter a word. But submissive to her influence, he preceded her in the direction she pointed out, and was soon put to bed. And it was well he had been so quietly disposed of; for a short 'time after Captain McLane, who had been collecting his company of mounted volunteers, halted in front of the door, and inquired of the people around if there were not some tories in that vicinity. Nearly all of them being in that category, of course he obtained no information. He then galloped off at the head of his men to join the army. At a late and solemn hour of the night, Ann was roused from her slumber by a frightful shriek. It proceeded from Flora. The girls occupied the same chamber. "In the name of heaven, Flora, what is the matter?" cried Ann. Flora made no reply. But the light of the moon enabled Ann to see her, sitting upright in bed. Her cap had fallen off, and her profusion of dark hair had fallen down upon her breast and shoulders. Her hands were pressed against her temples, and she seemed, from the heaving of her bosom to be gazing at some spectacle of horror. Pale as the snowy robe around her, was her face, and the delicate hands she pressed against it. Long she remained in this position, as silent, and almost as motionless as a statue. The anxious and endearing tones of   THE MONARCHST.         367 Ann seemed, for many moments, to be unheard, so deeply was she absorbed in the vision that entranced her. "Oh, God!" at length she exclaimed, " it is over, and I am miserable for ever-for ever nmore!"She then prostrated herself on the couch, and sobbed hysterically. "Tell me, tell me, Flora, said Ann, approaching her, "what it is that so distresses you! No one is in the chamber but our- I:  selves, and all is still without. It must have been a dream." "Ay, and more-more than a dream. It was a vision of the sad reality that is to come. I saw it all, just as it will be. Oh, Ann! my fate is sealed for ever on earth! There is no happiness for me short of heaven. Pray for me that I may go thither!" "What did you see?" X  "The battle, the terrible battle!" "That cannot be. The armies are not expected to meet for several days, perhaps weeks yet." "No matter, Ann; were it months, I have witnessed the result, so far as. my fate is involved in it. You know my secret. I have confided in you. Unhappy youth! How little, it may be, at this moment is he aware of his impending doom! How joyful, perhaps, his anticipations! For you know he promised to be here within one short month. But my vision! I saw him give his impatient charger the rein, and plunge forward in the midst of the slaughter, with the cry of 'Esperance en Dieu!' His sword gleamed over his noble head like a bright halo. The cheers of his admiring followers rent the air, as they rushed forward to victory-victory for them-but oh, death for Percy!" This was uttered with so heart-rending a tone, that Ann could not avoid sobbing in sympathy. "But, Flora," said she, after a long pause, "this was merely a dream 1" "A dream! And so are the events of the past. What are all the joys of our infancy, the innocent hopes we cherished, the sweets we tasted, the blissful moments passed in smiles,- but dreams? But they were realities too, and we remember them; still, what more were they than dreams? And if we remember the visions that sped before us so lightly, can this one, which has pierced my inmost heart, be ever obliterated from my throbbing brain?" i   "But are you quite sure you saw him fall?" "Ah, too sure! The envious messenger of death pierced his breast. He fell from his proud steed in mid career against the yielding enemy."     168         THE MONARCHST. "Was no one near to aid him?" "I saw him borne from the field; I even saw his footman John, following in tears. Then the scene was changed. I know not how; but I was near his dying couch, and heard him utter his last words; words, Ann, I must not repeat. They were for me alone!" In vain did Miss Custis strive to comfort her distressed com- panion. Alth6ugh it was morally certain that as yet the battle lad not been fought-and Flora readily admitted it-still the result seen in the vision, she regarded as equally certain to trans-- pire. It was to her the decree of fate; and she mourned her absent lover as one destined inevitably to be slain.    THE MONARCHST.         169 CHAPTER XIII. Proclaim the news? the battle won? Then hath a miracle been done! Alas! the tale cannot be true, Stragglers return, and foes pursue! THE gloomiest days of the revolution were at hand, when Washington's last stand in defence of Philadelphia was to prove ineffectual. New York was in possession of the enemy; in the north, General Burgoyne was intent upon opening communica- tions between the lakes and that city, which would have the effect of severing the New England states from the rest of the con- 1   federation, and ultimately of subjecting them to the will of the invaders. The line of posts from the Hudson to Canada once in possession of the British, no aid could henceforth be given the detached states; for in the centre and in the south the American army was destined to have sufficient employment. France was not yet prepared to render open assistance; which i must have involved her in an immediate war with Great Britain. Iany of her brave sons, however, had voluntarily entered the American service. But what could field officers accomplish without divisions and brigades of disciplined men? And now all seemed to be staked upon the issue of a single battle. As if to encourage the desponding, and to stimulate the citizens able to bear arms, to rally round his standard in defence of their common country, Washington had made a stirring ap- peal to their senses by a military display such as had never be- fore been equalled in the city of Penn. Nor was it without effect, so far as the mere numbers of his recruits might avail. But when did raw militia ever successfully contend against a well-appointed regular army in a pitched bat- tle? For purposes of defence behind impregnable fortifications, or in the effervescence of an assault, as at Bennington, they may do good service. But to stop the progress of an advancing ene- my in the field, and at a distance from their homes, they must. generally prove wholly inefficient. And, Washington knowing this perfectly well, it is still a matter of wonder that he should have attempted to withstand bir William Howe at Brandywine, a small stream, which could not be supposed to form any serious 15     170         THE MONARCHST. obstacle to an army's advance. If it was necessary to give bat- tle at all to a superior foe in defence of Philadelphia, it was the opinion of enlightened officers, founded upon the experience of the past, that the attack should have been made on the invaders soon after their landing, and before they had an opportunity of obtaining guides, and deploying across the country; or else to have occupied a defensive position behind the Schuylkill, in view of the city, and erected breastworks on the north. Then, it is true, in the event of defeat, there would have been no retreat but across the Delaware. But would not the militia have main- tained their ground better in such a position? And would not Washington have had it in his power to deliver a fatal blow on the enemy's flanks, which must have been exposed in their cirEui- tons march to the most eligible point of attack? And if the enemy had sustained a defeat, they would have been utterly cut off from their ships, and with no means of crossing the Delaware. On the memorable 11th September, 1777, the American army was posted behind the Brandywine; and if the British had as- sailed it only as it was hoped would be the case, no doubt the position would have been maintained. But the enemy had merely to diverge a few miles to the left, to out-flank our right, and, if unopposed, to get in the rear of it; if opposed, the main position at Chad's Ford would be so weakened by detachments as to be untenable. Hence the enemy approached in two columns, and divided the attention of the Americans. Sullivan's right gave way before the column led by Cornwallis, after some severe fighting; and General Greene strove in vain to arrest the advancing column, which now threatened to intercept Washington's communications with the city, and rendered the divisions stationed at Chad's Ford, under Wayne, and in the pre- sence of the Commander-in-chief, unable to withstand the assault of the second column of the enemy, led directly on by Knip- hausen. Before the engagement became general, it was found necessary for the American army to fall back at all points, to secure the rear and save the stores. This was accomplished amidst partial combats and much desultory skirmishing. Our young officers, Custis and Waples, did more service with the heels of their horses that day, than with their swords. They were kept upon the gallop between Chad's Ford and the detach- ment under Sullivan, transmitting the orders of Washington, and bringing intelligence of the movements of the enemy. And had they been employed in this service at an earlier hour of the day, the result of the battle might have been different; for the first messengers employed had made erroneous reports, and mis-   THE MONARCHST.         171 led the American generals in regard to the progress of Lord Cornwallis. l    IfIt was when General Greene arrived upon the ground, and attempted to arrest the flying regiments under Sullivan, that the most blood was shed. His troops maintained a firm front for more than an hour, disputing the ground inch by inch. When the enemy ascended an eminence whence they beheld his determined front, they uttered a loud shout, and prepared for the exciting work they saw before them. Young Percy had that morning, as ever, been the gayest of the gay in the British army. The exuberance of his spirits was so excessive as to have attracted general observation. Wherever he moved, and his proud steed was seen prancing in almost every direction, his jovial remarks had produced pleasant smiles. But when it was announced that they had found an enemy at last, whose determined countenance bore unmistakeable evidence that there must be hard blows before the British Lion could advance any further in its victorious career, he sped forward to the sum. mit of the hill, from which the faces of the Americans could be seen, with every manifestation of delight. He gazed long and steadfastly; and while he surveyed the scene, it was observed that he grew deadly pale, and that all his vivacity had vanished. "What's the matter, Percy?" asked Captain Montresor; "where now are your jokes and bon-mots?" "The dead joke not," said Percy. "The dead? Of course not; but the living do." "Percy is no more among the living. In a dream, before I sailed to America, I witnessed this spectacle. Montresor, smile not; it is true. There is not a tree, a house-even that plain meeting-house-a rivulet, a mound, or field, before me, that I did not behold in my vision. Even the uniforms of the enemy, and their positions, as I see them now, I distinctly remember in that warning spectacle. John!" he said, calling to his side his faithful servant, "take this watch. It is a last token for my sister. I charge you to deliver it, and to repeat my words of affection to her. Take this purse also; it is yours. In regard to my body--   he whispered the rest. "Do not despair, Percy!" continued Montresor, who was seriously moved by the sad tones and grave visage of his friend. "Admitting this'spectacle to be a faithful counterpart of your vision, I do not perceive how it can be inferred that it is to be the scene of your death." "I did not tell you all. It was unnecessary. My inference was sufficient. But, Montresor, you named the word despair,"     172         THE MONARCIIIST. continued Percy, smiling; "if by that is meant fear of death, the event will show how much you are mistaken. How easily might I turn my face away, and avoid even the possibility of injury!" "Upon my soul, I meant no such thing, Percy. It would be ridiculous for any one to insinuate that a Percy feared to en- counter death itself. Too many of the race have embraced the grim monster on the battle-field, to have left a drop of coward's blood in the veins of their descendants. But why not avoid this encounter? You may do it with honour. You are here merely as an amateur." "I might do it were it not for the vision, which has decided my fate; and in truth, Montresor, I could wish to live for the sake of the one who is in Philadelphia, and who looks forward to our joyful meeting. But to turn back now, Montresor, appalled by this vision, however it might be regarded by you and others, would be cowardice in my own estimation. I must meet my fate, and-Espdrance en Dieu!" "But is there no word you would send to her who expects you in the city?" "Yes-say I was true--Hark! the charge is sounded. On!" "Hold!" cried Montresor; "one word more, or else I can- not deliver the message. Her name?" "See Wales-he will tell you all!"And springing forward, the foremost in the attack, young Percy fell, mortally wounded.* He was borne on a litter into the presence of Sir William Howe, the commander-in-chief of the British army, who paused a moment in the midst of his advance against the retreating Americans, and uttered lamentations over his unfortunate young friend, who still survived, but in a feeble and sinking condition. "Is there anything, my dear friend," said Sir William, " that I can do for you?" "Yes," said Percy. "Name it; it shall be done, if possible." "I would be conveyed to Philadelphia alive, if possible; if not, I would still prefer to repose there." "It may be a fortnight before we get the city in our posses- sion," said Sir William, pondering; "after all, Washington will not hazard a total overthrow, and we shall have to move with circumspection. But the wounded cease to be regarded as ene- mies. Wales," he added, beckoning Master Robert, who was * The particulars of Percy's vision and his fall, are authenticated by the most faithful chroniclers of the day.   THE MONARCHST.         173 conversing apart with Montresor, to approach, "you will accom- pany poor Percy to Philadelphia. 'Doubtless you can obtain passports and a boat." a "I will do my utmost, sir," said Wales, who was much moved by the sad- condition of his young friend. He it was who had promoted the attachment between Percy and Flora, and had contrived the means for them to correspond during their separation; and he contemplated their meeting, if Percy should survive until he could reach the city, with very melancholy feel- ings. He lost no'time, however, in having a flag sent to Washing- ton, with a request for passports, which he knew would be readily granted; and he had Percy. borne, accompanied by a surgeon, towards the Delaware river, where a small boat was to be pro- cured. If the exditement in the city had been great, and increasing daily for weeks, it had now reached its climax. It was a con- sternation. A solitary horseman, on the eve of the 11th September, came down Chestnut street in a brisk gallop; hundreds strove to arrest his speed, that they might learn the news from the army. But, looking neither to the right nor the left, he never drew rein until he had reached the mansion of Mrs. Ferguson, where a great many royalists, and nearly as many patriots, of both sexes (for the end of her policy was to produce a reconciliation between the countries), were assembled. "The news? the news?" cried all, with one voice, when the stranger was ushered into the parlour. "Washington has gained a victory," said he, "and the British are retreating back to their ships!" "Thanks! thanks! Oh, God, I thank thee!" exclaimed Mrs. Reed, who had followed her lord as far as the city, where she intended to await his return, which might be expected very soon, if Washington succeeded in driving back the enemy. But she had taken the precaution to be in readiness to fly beyond the reach of the British, in the event of a reverse to the American arms. "Now you may have your horses unharnessed," said Miss Franks. "This night you will sup with your lord." "Be not too sure of it!" said Mrs. Ferguson. "How did you learn this thing?" she continued, addressing the messenger. "Were you present? Did you see it with your own eyes?" "No, madam," said the messenger; " but I heard the cannon, I had been stationed a few miles from the field (on this side of 15*     174         TIIE MONARCIIIST. it), by General Wayne, who was to send me word of the fate of the day, which I was to bring to the city." "Ay, I see; Wayne is at his pranks again!" said Mrs. Ferguson, smiling, and now quite incredulous. "Wayne intended to frighten us all out of the city before his Majesty's generals arrived in it." "The generals of neither country will frighten me out of it. I am comfortable here," said Miss Franks, "and I will with- stand a long siege before I leave my home." "That is right," said Mr. Duch6; "no one will molest you" here." "And if they did, she would retaliate with a vengeance," said Mr. Isaac Hunt, who had quite forgotten his carting. "Were you told to bring me this intelligence?" continued Mrs. Ferguson, addressing the messenger. * "Not-exactly-madam," said he, hesitating, "though I be- lieve you were mentioned. I was to deliver a note to Mr. Hassel for one of his guests, and then to spread the news. It was sup- posed that many interested persons would be at your house." "Mr. Jefferson is gone, at a full gallop," said Mr. Hewitt, who had been at 'the Half-Moon opposite the State-house, and entered at that moment. "Have you been to the inn?" asked Mrs. Ferguson, quickly, of the messenger. "No, madam; but I met Mr. Hassel, the landlord, near your door, and threw him the note." "Enough! that is sufficient!" exclaimed Mrs. Ferguson. "The note was for Jefferson. Jefferson has fled to Lancaster, or York, or Reading, or wherever the fugitive Congress may be resting for the moment. The royal arms have been victorious- I know it!" "And do you rejoice?" asked Mrs. Reed, in painful agitation. "Not for the wounds that may have been inflicted, or the number of fellow beings slain; in short, not at all; but I now entertain a hope that this unnatural contest will be speedily ended, and that we will be all united under our King." "And you be severed from your lord," said Miss Franks to Mrs. Reed. "I suppose your horses will be harnessed again." By this time other messengers arrived, spreading accounts of the discomfiture of the American army, and heightening, if possible, the consternation of the citizens. Mrs. Reed, in spite of the endeavours of Mrs. Ferguson and Mr. Duch6 to detain her, immediately left the city, and crossed over to New Jersey, where she bad left her children.   THE MONARCHST.         175 That night the fugitives continued to pour into the city; and by morning nearly one half the American army had flown thither. Washington had retired to Chester, with the remnant of his forces which still remained true to their colours. [Early the next morning the retreat was continued towards the city. Colonel Reed was the first of the staff to arrive. He had pre- ceded the rest by permission .of the Commander-in-chief; for he had been notified of his appointment as a member of Congress, and had determined to transfer his services from the field to the halls of legislation. His first inquiry at Mrs. Ferguson's was in relation to his be- loved wife; and his disappointment was great when he learned that she had left the city the day before. And now his presence was demanded without delay in Congress! He wrote a letter to Mrs. Reed, however, requesting her to recross the river at Tren- ton and meet him at Reading. This was intrusted to Mrs. Fer- guson. "And now farewell, madam," said he, preparing to set out again in quest of the perambulating Congress. "There is no rest for the wicked, Colonel," said Mrs. Fergu- son, her hand in his. "When, oh, when will these troubles cease!" "God knows, my dear madam, if it lay within my power, they would cease instantly. None can be more weary of this distressful contest than myself." "It is you, Colonel, and such characters, who prolong the con- flict. You, alone, have it in your power to contribute much towards a reconciliation. Only throw your weight into the proper scale; yield to the supremacy of the crown; and when peace is once more restored, the mother country will redress every griev- ance, and grant all the rights and privileges you have contended for. This I know; else you may be assured I would not be so positive. And what is more, as a guarantee that your private interests shall not receive any detriment hereafter, you. may designate the office under his Majesty you would fill, and it is yours. Besides, ten thousand pounds in specie will be imme- diately at your disposal. And then there will be no more sepa- rations between man and wife-- "Merciful heaven, madam! what is all this you are speaking to me? I have been lost in astonishment, else I had interrupted you ere this. I am not worth purchasing, madam; but such as I am, King George is not rich enough to buy me!"And bow- ing very low, the Colonel withdrew and mounted his horse, which he spurred away with unwonted energy,     176         THE MONARCHST. It is probable that a large proportion of the ladies remaining in the city experienced no terror from the reports of the approach of the British; and the number of the other sex who secretly accorded with them in sentiment, if not so great, was by no means contemptible. At all events, many of the fine mansions in the city were decorated within, and other domestic arrange- ments were made, as if in anticipation of the reception of noble visiters and agreeable guests, who were to be handsomely enter- tained. Such preparations were certainly not meant to afford a hearty welcome to Washington and his defeated army, who were then arriving in disorder; for it was already announced that the soldiers would not remain even a day in the city, but proceed with as little delay as possible to Germantown. Washington and his generals halted at the Indian Queen hotel, in Fourth street, and partook of a hasty collation. The blame of the defeat was principally laid upon General Sullivan, who commanded the right column; and upon Colonel Deborre, who led the Maryland militia. "I shall demand a court martial, General," said Sullivan, whose meat remained untasted. - "I have already received seve- ral notes, by which I know I am to be censured, unless acquitted by my brother officers." "General," said Washington, "I do not censure you. It was no fault of yours, that you were misled by false intelligence. The people living in the neighbourhood were not our friends. If they had given you- timely notice of the approach of Cornwallis, you would have doubtless'intercepted him." "And I, too, General," said Colonel Deborre; "I have notes of condemnation." ': You bear, Colonel," said Washington, " an honourable testi- mony of having bravely stood your ground." The Colonel had been wounded twice, but not seriously. "True, General, I was Wounded; but it is no less true that the first regiment which gave way was mine, and that an investi- gation will be required. They may investigate as much as they please; but they shall not try me. I intend to resign. If the Americans will run, I will not be responsible."* "And I will go into the ranks, and fight on foot, shoulder to shoulder with the men, rather than relinquish the field at such a moment to the enemy!" said young Lafayette, who had re- ceived a ball through his leg, and had been conveyed from the field in a carriage. - "Nobly spoken, my dear Marquis!" exclaimed Washington. * Colonel Deborre was a foreigner, and did resign.   THE MONARCHST.         1" "But, my dear Marquis, the doctor says it is absolutely necessary for you to remain quiet and be perfectly composed for some days to come. When we reach Germantown, comfortable lodgings shall be provided for you. And as for you, my dear Count," he con- tinued, addressing Pulaski, who had done wonders in checking the pursuit of the enemy, "I think the first despatch I receive from Congress will take from me a volunteer, and give to the army a General." The Count bowed very low, and signified that he would be proud to render the best service in his power, in any position that might be assigned him. "But I miss our brace of young volunteers," said Wayne, looking round for Custis and Waples. "I must have them, General," he continued. Fighting is mere pastime for them. I saw them galloping over the field with your orders, when friend and foe were mingled not lovingly together. Unmindful of J  whistling bullets, and regardless of the loss of the day, and the fact that we were retreating, they could not resist diverging oc- casionally so far as to fall among the vanguard of the enemy. It did not detain them a moment. Men fell to the right and left under their swords or the aim of their pistols, while they skimmed over the the ground like swallows, without pausing scarcely a moment." "That was wrong," said Washington; "they might have fallen, and my orders would not have been executed. But they could not bear the thought of retiring without striking a blow. They told me so repeatedly. I will lecture them again. They will some day be slain, or captured, if they are not more prudent; and then their sweethearts will blame me for it." The repast over, the Coammander-in-chief gave the signal to depart, and they were all soon on the road to Germantown. What a contrast between this entry and departure of Washing- ton and his army, and the grand display they had made a few days before! Yet it had one good effect. It had been reported, and was believed at one time by many friendly to the cause, that half the army had been destroyed; whereas, only some twelve hundred had been killed, wounded, and taken; while the loss of the British in killed and wounded did not fall short of six hun- dred. Colonel Reed having resigned, a young officer, a native of New York, was selected by Washington to supply his place as one of his aids. This was Colonel Alexander Hamilton, a young gentle- man of genius, literary attainments, and most respectable family. The other aids were Colonels Cobb and Humphreys, both efficient     178         THE MONARCHST. in the field, and enjoying the entire confidence of the CoB mander-in-chief; but Colonel Reed had been especially useful i aiding Washington in his voluminous correspondence; and Col, nel Hamilton was fortunately no less expert in that species ( service. As the British did not seem to press forward eagerly, it w: surmised, and truly, that they would not attempt to enter ti city for some days. They approached circuitously and le surely, knowing that there would be no resistance on the part o the people, and rightly calculating that a detour to the left woul have the effect to draw thither the opposing army. But Washington was not idle. Knowing that the city was i effect already in the grasp of the enemy, he despatched Colon Hamilton,with a sufficient force from his head-quarters at Germa: town, to levy contributions or purchase such stores and clothir as might be found in the city, for the use of his army. He for saw what would be his deficiency in the winter, and sought i this unpleasant manner to provide for it, being aware that a such articles as might be useful to an army would, if left by hir be appropriated by the British. Thus, for several days after the retreat from Brandywine, tl citizens received domiciliary visits from the American officers and many of them who had to contribute or sell such proper and provisions as suited the purposes of the inspectors, we: rendered extremely impatient for the arrival of the enem: From the Americans, they received merely receipts, as evidenc; of debt, or continental paper, of little value; from the Britis] the pay would be in gold and silver. Hence all who were me cenary or disaffected secreted their goods as much as possibl and the ungrateful service upon which Hamilton had been sen did not yield many abundant fruits, either in material for tl army, or in affection for the cause. Upon learning the resul Washington expressed to Congress a fervent hope that he migl never again be under the necessity of resorting to such an exp dient.    t,   THE MONARCIIIST.         1 U CHAPTER XIV. Bury him at midnight Enveloped in gloom, By flickering torch-light 9:vW   :   Fulfilling his doom!  CUSTIS and Waples arrived with the rear-guard of the retreat- ing army, which had been joined, after the battle, by the Vir- ginia regiment under Colonel Matthews. They had then the satisfaction of meeting with many of their friends from the ea etrn shore, and among them were Major Cropper and others, from whom they learned with satisfaction that the counties of Accomac and Northampton remained unmolested by the enemy. The only source of annoyance they were subjected to, being from the occasional incursions of Captain Josiah Philips and his com- pany of freeboqting tories, who had been outlawed by the legis- lature of Virginia, in pursuance of a resolution brought forward by J. Tyler, Esq. They did not exactly co-operate with the enemy, nor seem to act under the orders of the British; and hence they were subsequently dealt with as common highway robbers. Our brace of young officers hastened, upon reaching the city, to wait upon the ladies at Mrs. Darrah's. It was late in the night when they rapped at the door. The parlour, they observed, was illuminated more brilliantly than usual. "What can this mean?" asked Custis, while they stood at the door, waiting to be admitted. "Is it a party or a wedding, do you think?" "Who is here to be married?" was the response of Waples. "Who?  Why, two as handsome young ladies as step the soil of America-one only excepted." "Nonsense, Tom. You know neither of them are at liberty to marry. I was here, alone, several hours ago, in disguise. No one knew meA Ann seemed grave, but in good health." "These are ifebellious times, as father Duche says," said Cus- tis. You should have inquired if other visiters did not frequent the house in your absence."     180         THE MONARCHST. The only reply to this was a very violent exercise of the knocker by Waples. They were admitted by Mrs. Darrah herself, who stood pale and silent before them, with a wax candle in her hand. To the repeated bows and curious looks of the young men, she merely pointed the way to the entrance into the parlour. They entered, and stood amazed. Messrs. Hewitt and Mac- Coskie, in their black gowns, first attracted their attention. Next, they beheld Flora standing in the centre of the room, decked in snowy satin, and with all the paraphernalia of a bride. But her face was as. pale as her robes. Beside her stood her mother and Miss Custis, decked somewhat similarly, and almost as pale. The many wax lights heightened the. effect of the scene. It was a picture of thrilling intensity to the young gen- tlemen, who had been groping their way in the darkness with- out; and it was not surprising that they stood for some moments in mute astonishment, divested alike of the power of speech and motion. "Fit guests for such an occasion!" said Flora, in tones of startling distinctness, amid the death-like silence which prevailed. "It is well you come with your swords! No matter if they be still dripping with blood!" Waples, lost in amazement, involuntarily drew forth his sword about half-way, and scanned the blade. "Ay, see if it be not gory!" continued Flora. "Victims have fallen beneath its edge; and many a poor hcart, like mine, though absent, has been penetrated. But what was that to thee? To thee? Oh, it was rare sport!" "How  the d-l," said Waples, in a whisper to Custis, do the women find out everything? I'll wager my horse they are going to tell us the names of every one we slew in the retreat!" "Ah, yes; whisper softly!"Flora continued, looking at a note in her hand, which she had taken from her bosom; " it must be seemly at a bridal-funeral. It is almost the hour! Wait, gentlemen; be not impatient; the bridegroom approaches!" "Is she going to be married, sure enough? asked Waples of Ann, whom he had ventured to approach, notwithstanding her eyes remained fixed upon the floor. The only reply she gave was a cold, mysterious shake of the head. "Upon my soul!" said he, in louder tones than he had pre- viously used, and addressing no onie in particular, "this is all exceedingly strange to me!" "Upon your soul? Ah! what is there not upon it?"' said   THE MONARCHST.         181 Flora. "Strange-strange, but true; and truth, they say, is stranger than fiction. Be patient but a few minutes longer," she continued, pointing to the dial of the tall clock at the end of the room, "and you may feast your eyes with a sad spectacle. It is the only feast we can afford to set before you on this occa- sion." Custis, determined to seek an explanation, retired to a corner and beckoned the clergymen to join him there. But when they turned round for that purpose, they were prevented by Flora. "No, gentlemen!" said she, " everything will be developed in good time. And the hour has come!"  It was true. It was striking twelve. And a loud rap was heard at the door. "Stir not!" said Flora. "They will be admitted. Everything has been arranged according to my wishes-everything but that which it was impossible to accomplish. Be ye all quite calm. I am marble!" As she said this, Master Robert Wales and the British sur- geon entered, followed by four soldiers bearing a litter upon which reposed the body of young Percy, enveloped in a military cloak. "Is he dead?" demanded Flora, when the litter was put down, in a loud, unearthly voice. There was a profound silence. She looked at the faces of Wales and the surgeon, and then at the motionless form of Percy. "It is enough " she continued ; "Speak not! Nay, do not even say that he loved me, and charged you to repeat his last words of affection. What could he say, that I should not know already? He is here, true to his appointment. And you will all bear witness that I was ready to fulfil my promise. You see me decked in bridal robes. Here is my bride's-maid. Here my mother. And there stand the ministers of God, ready to perform the ceremony. Weep not, Ann; my eyes are dry. Why do I not weep?  Tears might soothe me. But should the bride weep? I am not the first bride who has met her lord with an aching heart. Yet I would weep if I could. Remove the cloak! Let me gaze upon his fair cold face! Approach not, sirs!" she said quickly, as Custis and Waples moved forward with the rest. "I would not see his wounds bleeding afresh!" "By heaven! we are not murderers!" said Waples, whose proffered support had, at the moment, been repulsed by Ann, ./ who was panting with loss of colour and respiration. "He has fallen in battle, upon the field of honour. A glorious deathM! "Still, I cannot weep!" said Flora, now supported by both 16     182         THE MONARCIIIST. the clergymen. Honour! Glory!" she continued, catching at the words of Waples, as she was led slowly and gently away from the freezing spectacle. "I suppose they think so, or they would not say so. Besides, do they not seek it themselves in the same way? But yet my poor heart denies it. And how many other hearts will respond to mine? No, it is ambition; and those who reap the benefits of war, rarely expose themselves to its dangers. But I forgive them. Only tell me, gentlemen!" she exclaimed, relinquishing the arms of the clergymen, and placing her white hands upon the shoulders of Custis and Waples, "Only tell me, and truly, that he did not fall beneath your hands!" "We have not seen him since we parted in Virginia, until this night," was the answer. "I thank you. May God forgive every one, as I do! But why do we stand here idle? Gentlemen," she said, addressing the clergymen, "you have doubtless done as I requested, and brought hither your prayer-books? Matrimony-visitation of the sick-burial of the dead-" she continued, taking up a book and turning over the pages. "Turn to this, and perform the rites set forth in the rubric. All is prepared-and by my order. The coffin is in the hall. The grave is ready, and not far away. Take up the bier, and with solemn and measured tread, bear him to St. Peter's church-yard. We will bear the torches. Let no word be spoken, save those of the ministers and the usual responses." It was done. The funeral rites were thus performed at that silent hour. Flora, decked as she was, bore a wax-taper over her head, and witnessed, in silent anguish, the last solemn cere- mony performed over the one she loved. And then she wept; and was supported by the arm of Custis as they returned.  Ann, too, Seemed to be so far reconciled to Waples, that she no longer repulsed his tenders of assistance. "Farewell," said he, when about taking leave at the house, "until to-morrow. I cannot say, nor can you be in a condition to hear, what I wish to speak." "I can hear you," said she, in a melancholy voice; " provided you have to announce your purpose of leaving the army imme- diately, and returning to Virginia." "That would be impossible. I could not abandon the cause in such a moment of gloom and disaster; nor could I expect to reach the eastern shore in safety, while the roads and waters are eveirwhere filled with the British and tories." "Then what can you have to say to me?"   THE MONARCHST.         183 "That it will not be prudent for you to remain any longer in this city." "And yet it would not be safe for even yourself to leave it?" "I do not mean that you shall go to Virginia; but that you should leave this city. The British army will soon be here." "And where would you have me go? "I kIow not, exactly. The camp would not be a fitting place. I   But suppose you go to York, where Congress is sitting? Mrs.    Ferguson intends going thither soon, I learn, on a brief visit. She would take you." " No, sir " said Ann; "I am under the charge and protec- tion of Mr. MacCoskie, our parish minister; he does not advise is  me to leave the city; and I shall remain." "But, Ann, you will fall into the hands of the enemy!" "I know not that. You deemed the noble youth, whom we have just buried, an enemy. He was no enemy of mine. Per- haps his brother officers are as gentle and noble as he was. ( Ann! surely you would not regard the enemies of your country as your friends, and, relying upon their honour, put your- self in their power, and at their mercy?" "I know not who are the greatest enemies to the country; but it seems my best friends are not to be among my countrymen. You see me far from home, and separated from my indulgent mother and uncle. You demand that I shall go, you know not whither, while you and my brother gallop off to the field of battle, to slay or be slain. I shall remain where I am. Mr. MacCoskie will protect me. I feel safe under his care, although he is a foreigner, and in favour of a restoration of peace by submission to the lawful and rightful King, as he considers him." "Yes! Wales, the monarchist, has convinced him, and all the churchmen, that we must have a king. But were not the Stuarts, a short time since, the only rightful princes?" "I know not the merits of this controversy, and have not sought to know them. I desire only peace. And as I do not discuss the questions which divide the community, I cannot be- lieve that I have any reason to' apprehend molestation from either party. Yet I hear a great deal. I learn that you are engaged in a hopeless cause; that Congress has no means of carrying on the war; and that soon the country will be everywhere in posses- sion of the British." "It is a blasted lie! forgive me! you know my old habit. But, if you must hear these false statements, I beg you will not believe them. Only remain neutral until we can have one more chance at the enemy!"     184        THE MONARCHST. "I see you are anxious for another battle!" "Ann, you know my blunt nature. I may be sent to keep young Percy company before we meet again; and I will, there. fore, as ever, be candid with you. I am anxious for another fight, not on my own account, but for my country. The more it sinks under defeat, the more I love it; and the more deter- mined I feel to render it good service. Oh, if you could only see the grief of Washington, at times, when he is alone, you would feel more than a womaa's pity for his distresses i" "I feel for all who suffer." "And I feel for our country most, because it suffers most. And would' I not be contemptible in your eyes, if I were to abandon it now, in its distress?" "I would not see you act a dishonourable part. If you deem it your duty to fight, in heaven's name, go to the battle-field." Spoken like a heroine!  God bless you, Ann! Only let me serve my country a little longer in this her greatest need, and then the rest of my life shall be devoted to you!" Ann made no reply. Within the parlour, now occupied by nqne but the male por- tion of the late funeral procession, there was a scene which bore none of the traces of the recent sad ceremonies. Wales stood before the two clergymen reading a letter which had been submitted for his perusal. It was the famous one in- dited by the reverend Mr. Duch6 to Washington, and which was to be borne to Germantown on the morrow by Mrs. Ferguson, who was afterwards to proceed on a brief visit to York. "  I am sorry for it!"' said Wales, in tones of decided disappro- bation. "It will not answer any good purpose; and if I had been consulted I should have pronounced against it. I know Washington's character better than they who have prompted this experiment. I am aware he entertains feelings of respect for Mr. Duch6, and reverences his calling; but the moemen the reads this appeal, the instant he finds the reverend gentleman presuming to instruct him in matters not pertaining to the church, but venturing to advise lim to perform an act which would be treasonable in his estimation, and would be dishonour- able in the eyes of the world, he will, regardless of consequences, spurn the proposition, and enclose the letter to the President of the Congress. Then the effect will be a general indignation through- out the country, and new zeal for the cause of America. And such, likewise, is to be the result of the offer to Colonel Reed. I am  glad, however, Mrs. Ferguson did not exhibit the letter she received from Governor Johnstone. It may be denied."   TIIE MONARCHST.         185 "-What would you have us do, Master Robert?" asked Mr. MacCoskie. "Should there be no efforts made but with the sword? If that be the only way remaining to effect a recon- ciliation, it seems to me that our services, as well as your own, likewise, may be dispensed with hereafter." "Not so, either, my dear sir," replied Wales. "There is a time for all things, you know. And it strikes me it should have been known, that when smarting under defeat, and exasperated by disappointment, neither Washington nor Reed would be likely to listen to pacific overtures, and much less to be tempted to desert their country's cause, rendered almost desperate, and so recently, by the very foes you would have them embrace! I will bear no portion of the responsibility of either of the steps which have it  been taken, and must disavow all participation in them. The obvious policy of his Majesty's generals now, is inactivity; at most to act on the defensive, when in possession of the city. 3   The painful reality of the evils the Americans must now endure, and their gloomy forebodings of the future, must plead silently ,and powerfully in favour of reconciliation-more powerfully than anything we can say or write." The party withdrew from the house together, and continued their conversation in the street, as they walked towards the Indian Queen hotel, on Fourth street, where they were to seek repose for a few brief hours only. It was long after midnight when they retired, and the young Virginians and Wales were, by appointment, to set out at an early hour in the morning for the head-quarters of the army. 16* I4     186         THE MONARCHST. CHAPTER XY. Upon the gibbet let him hang, The leader of a murderous gang! *  *   *  *   *        4 a "MASTER BOB," said Custis, as the party of three were on the road to Germantown, "where, in the name of all the imps of Satan, do you come from, and where do you go to, when you so mysteriously disappear, and so periodically return?" "Master Thomas," said Wales, gravely, "when you were a pupil of mine, if I remember rightly, one of the lessons I strove to impress upon your mind, was the impropriety of an idle curiosity, and of interrogating your seniors in matters with which you can not, and ought not, to have any concern." "Sam," said Custis, turning to Waples; " what do you think of that? I have forgotten that lesson." "And so have I," said Waples; "at least I do not see its applicability on the present occasion." "Then pardon me for reminding you of it; and permit me to remark that it does apply on the present occasion." "But, sir," said Custis, "give me leave to intimate that you are not our tutor any longer, unless you will deign to permit us to learn from you the information I have solicited." "Pshaw! urge me no further, young man, else I must rebuke in a still more decided manner your impertinent curiosity!" "Master Bob," said Custis, reining up his steed a little in advance of Wales, and then bursting into a fit of laughter, if you were only a boy of my size, I would strike you!" "Don't hurt him, Tom," said Waples; "he's too small." For several moments Wales remained silent, while the purple mark mounted to his forehead. His brows became contracted, and his eyes gleamed like a serpent's. "One at a time, young gentlemen! come on! I will under- take to punish you both! Choose your weapons-swords or pistols; I have both! Which shall begin? Why do you riot draw?" "Not the fear of you," said Custis; " but of offending Wash- ington."   THE .MONARCHST.         187 "Ay; it seems, then, you can remember his lessons. Let us on, then; and have no more of your nonsense," said Wales, smiling, his cloud of anger vanishing from his brow. "But, still, Master Bob," continued Custis, "you have been engaged in sending information to the enemy; and you must have been in the enemy's camp at the Brandywine. Else how could you have brought the body of young Percy to the city?" "No matter, sir," said Wales, "since neither Washington nor Sir William Howe throw any impediments in my way, nor call my conduct in question. You perform your duty, and I mine. Time will show whose services have been the most valuable. I   am a non-combatant, except in cases of self-defence-but an avowed monarchist. I would heal the wounds inflicted by the sword, and reconcile both countries under one King. That is my mission, openly avowed everywhere. Perhaps my stature insures me impunity; if so, and I should be enabled to effect my object, I shall not lament it; but rather be thankful that I was formed thus for a good purpose. It is not his physical pro- portions which constitute the power of a man. He is infinitely smaller than a whale, and yet he subdues him; and I would en- deavour to chain the monster discord, by such abilities as God has been pleased to bestow upon me." "But have you not advocated the restoration of the Stuarts?" asked Custis ; "and if so, can you be in amity with the House of Hanover?" "I believed in the Divine right of kings, it is true, and do still. I do not think that subjects have the right to change a dynasty, or the order of succession, else one man would have as good a right to reign as another; but God can discard the un- worthy. Charles is incapable of reigning; God has given him passions and blemishes which disqualify him; and that is an evidence that the divinity of his right has been removed. But, young pupils of mine, methinks you have forgotten your history, and, like a vast majority of Anglo-Americans, think the Georges are a distinct race from our ancient line of monarchs. It is not so. They are Stuarts. The first George was the great grandson of James I., who was the son of Mary Stuart, Queen of Scot- land." "Who was beheaded by Queen Elizabeth," said Waples. "Yes. Every one knows that. But how few seem to know that George III. is a descendant of the unfortunate Mary?" When they approached the camp, their attention was attracted by a crowd on the hill to the right, and by the sounds of car- penter's- implements. Upon a nearer view they perceived that a     188        THE MONARCHST. number of workmen were employed in the erection of a scaffold; and that they were then in the act of placing the cross-piece of timber on the top of the posts planted in the earth. The multi- tude of women, boys, and even little children, in the vicinity, were gazing at the manacled victims who were upon the ground, and awaiting the completion of the scaffold upon which they were doomed to terminate their earthly career. No sooner did our party ride up to this strange scene, for it lay in their way, being at the forks of the road, than there was a commotion in the mob, and several women ran out to meet them. "Come, for God's sake, before it's too late!" cried they, ad- dressing Wales, and seizing the bit of his bridle. "It's Cap- tain Fritz and Jack Doane," they continued, in a low tone. "They have been saying all the morning, if they could only see you they would be saved." "What are they to be hung for?" asked Wales. "Oh, because they took something or other in the King's name." "Perhaps they had no authority from the King for taking it. If they have acted without orders, they must abide the conse- quences." Wales learned from the deputy provost that Fritz and the Doanes had been murdering, robbing, and burning, in the neigh- bourhood. Their last act was the robbery of Mr. Hart, the treasurer'of Bucks county, from whom they took all the public funds in his possession, and for this the prisoners had been con- victed and sentenced. "I can do nothing for you," said Wales, riding up to the pri- soners. "You had no orders to act as highwaymen, and you must suffer the fate of robbers. If you had acted merely as ad- herents of the royal cause, you might have been treated as pri- soners of war, or at least have been tried by a military tribunal as spies. In that event I might have been able, probably, to effect your acquittal. But now the case is altogether beyond my control." "Don't say that!" said Doane, deprecatingly; "you know how faithful we have been." "And what services we might render hereafter," added Fritz. "Robbing, burning, and murdering," said Wales, sternly, "do not serve any cause. They -only exasperate the inhabitants, and strengthen their prejudices. The only possible way in which such men as you are can serve any cause, is in the conveying in- telligence, without being armed at all. This, you would nevev   THE MONARCHST.         189 submit to. No; you must wage war on your own account, and for your own benefit. You must take the consequences. Your fate is sealed; and it would be impossible for me to reverse it, even if I were disposed to do so, which is not the case. Pray to be forgiven. May God have mercy on your guilty souls!" "'  Amen!" said Waples. "A short response to a brief prayer. Now, Mr. Hangman, make short work of it, for you never launched into eternity a brace of rogues deeper dyed in villany in all your professional career." "For God's sake," said Fritz, appealing to Wales, "have it put off till to-morrow! Give us time to pray!" "And to-morrow would find you cutting the throats of others without the benefit of clergy," said Custis. "I learn it is a civil sentence," said Wales; ' the Commander- in-chief will have nothing to do in such cases." "He's already been applied to," said the masked hangman. "And what did he say?" asked Wales. "He advised us," said the hangman, in a whisper, " not to take our eyes off the prisoners until they have been hanging thirty minutes." "I am sorry for you," said Wales, turning to the prisoners. t "There is no hope. In less than an hour, you will both be in another world." And so they were. They died as they had lived, without penitence, amid the jeers and execrations of the mob. But they were not the only victims, or rather they did not die unavenged. The hangman had been dogged to his house by one of the brothers of Doane, who had mingled in the crowd dis- guised, and was found slain in his bed the next morning; and the houses of half the jurymen were burned the same night. The Commander-in-chief occupied temporarily Mr. Wistar's house, and was in consultation with his officers when our party arrived. The young men and Wales were shown into a small chamber, as they did not desire to intrude upon the council in the parlour, the doors of which they understood had been locked. After the adjournment of the council of field officers, Wash- ington did our young Virginians the honour to grant them the first interview. "You see, Master Bob," said Custis, we take precedence here." "It would be cruel," replied Wales, smiling, "for you to be kept waiting an hour or so. I shall not wait ten minutes. Thus I understand it." When the young men approached Washington, they observed     190         THE MONARCHST. that his face was slightly flushed, and that there was a mixtui of anxiety, impatience, and determination in his expression. "Young gentlemen," said he, "we are going to make anothe trial in the field. The enemy will despise us if we let thei march into the city without one more effort to save it. Are yo prepared to fight again?" "Try us, General!" said they. "I will not fail to give. you the opportunity you desire General Wayne has repeatedly requested me to let you accon pany him. Are you willing to fight one battle under him?" "Anxious, sir!" said Waples, eagerly grasping at the idea. We are willing to go anywhere, and do anything your Ex cellency may command," said the more discreet Custis. "True, sir," added Waples; " but we shall always esteem i a great honour to serve under your own eye, and near your ow person." "Very well, young gentlemen. This service may be accom plished in a day or two, as we learn the British army is now ap proaching. But I must request that you will act strictly withi: the limits of your orders. It will give me no pleasure, nor rer der you any advantage, to hear again of any individual exploit you may be tempted to engage in before, during, or after an' battle, not strictly within the limits of your instructions. Yot may infer from this that I have heard of your very brave, bu very imprudent conduct in the retreat from Brandywine. W. have no superabundance of brave young men, that their live, should be sacrificed unnecessarily. Recollect that the executioI you do in such instances, never benefits the cause we are em barked in; while, on the other hand, if you should fall in any of these single combats, your country would sustain a serious loss, your families and sweethearts be plunged into irremediable distress, and-and your General's heart be pierced with grief Adieu!" The young gentlemen retired filled with mingled emotions of gratitude, awe, and reverence. "We meet again, sir," said Washington, when Wales was admitted, "in days of gloom and doubt. May we part in brighter moments!" "I hope so!" said Wales, "and I believe so." "It may be so," said Washington, walking thoughtfully back. wards and forwards. "It is said the darkest hour precedes the light of morning. But why have I received no intelligence from you? Why were not the intentions of the enemy made known to me before the recent battle?' I    THE MONARCHST.         191 "It was impossible, sir; their movements depended upon, and were governed by yours." "Their purpose was pronounced, when Cornwallis moved to our right. That movement was concealed by false intelligence. Sullivan was misled. Had you any agency in it?" X  "None, sir; I was with Sir William.' But the result would have been the same. The enemy never supposed you would dis- pute their advance so far from the city, unless you had decided to give them battle on equal terms. It could be done on no other terms; for they had only to diverge from your strong positions, to the right or the left, and your flanks would be ex- posed. Had you suffered them to pass, and marched your whole army towards Elk river, they would not have approached the city." " "I believe so, now." "I know it, sir. They would have been misled by the suppo- sition that succours were pouring in to defend the city, while the main army was seeking to break up their communications in the rear. Or if the city had been fortified, and the battle fought in view of it, the result might have been different." "You criticise my generalship," said the Commander-in-chief, smiling, "and like others indulge in theoretical speculations. Enough of that. It is past. We have only to do with the future." "And that is apparently dark and sad enough. There is but one course, it appears to me, from which light and peace can flow; and that is submission to the crown, with certain stipula- tions and guarantees which shall place the colonies on as good a footing as they were before the commencement of the differences that led to this unhappy contest." "With such things you know I have nothing to do. Then why repeat them? I am merely the servant of the Congress. Why not express such sentiments to them?" "True; forgive me," said Wales. "But I was led to it by the knowledge of a fact which I have not approved, and which I fear may be detrimental to the great object which should be pur- sued on both sides. I learn that Mr. Duchd has written you a letter, appealing to your sense of justice and feelings of humanity to put an end to the war by treating with the agents of the crown at the head of the army." "You are mistaken!" said Washington, in warmth. "It is an error. I have received no such letter from the reverend gen- tleman, and hope I never shall!"     192         THE MONARCHST. "You have not received it; I know it well; and could hope likewise you might never see it. But it has been written." "Duche was a whig; he acted as chaplain to Congress, and preached before, me in Christ Church decidedly patriotic senti- ments, which I approved. , Why, he has printed one of his dis- courses, and dedicated it to me." "Upon mature consideration, he has embraced the royal cause.  "I am sorry for it, on many accounts. But I am satisfied his influence will not extend to his family. My friend, Mr. Hopkin- son, his brother-in-law, I know is a true whig, and can never be induced to abandon the cause he is embarked in." "It was to prepare you for the reception of the letter, that I solicited this interview, and to say I did not advise it. I hope you will suppress it, sir." "No, sir! Suppose such a letter should be seen by others, my enemies, perhaps, among my papers, and it should be known that I had taken no public steps in regard to it? Or, if I de- stroyed it, still there might be a copy preserved somewhere; at least the knowledge of its existence could not be suppressed, and  might be used to my injury. No, sir; there is but one course for me to pursue. If the letter comes into my possession, I must lay it before Congress." "So I feared; and Duche will be the victim of his own mis- guided zeal in a good cause." "I have respected Duch6, and shall be sorry for him, if he suffers any detriment. Even admitting the cause to be a good one, which I deny, as I believe we can never be ruled by Eng- land again, he should have known better than to propose an act of treason to his friend!" "In regard to the cause, sir, if you will allow me to refer to it again, I would remark that one who possesses your confidence, and who ist a member of your military family, is supposed, nay, known, to give the preference to a monarchy, even in the event of separation and independence." "You mean Colonel Hamilton. It is true. But he is de- cidedly in favour of the separation and independence first. There is not a more determined opponent to the pretensions of George III. in the army than he; nor a more high-minded, intelligent, and efficient individual in the nation. His sentiments, in regard to civil government, I have nothing to do with, and will not seek to control them. In his military capacity his conduct meets my cordial approbation."   THE MONARCHST.         193 I do not assail him, sir; nor reproach you for inconsistency in adhering to him." "But others do. No matter. Have you anything to commu- nicate? I suppose not, since you left the army at Brandywine." "Nothing special, sir. Only I think I may say that the British Commander-in-chief has instructions from home not to push matters to a greater extremity, hoping still that Congress will treat before the country be irretrievably ruined." "To greater extremity! Well; what is meant by that?" "Merely to act in the defensive, while maintaining his present positions. He will occupy Philadelphia, New York, and New England quietly, and await the result of the meditations of the representatives of the colonies, and of the people." I   "Philadelphia and New England! You speak as if they were already in the occupancy of the enemy." "The first is regarded to have fallen on the 11th instant. The march parallel to the river includes in subjection all the territory on their right. Of course no army, of unequal pretensions, will remain within that limit, to be enclosed and annihilated." Why, we are within that limit now!" "But you are too great a general to remain in it long. I do not seek for information, sir, as to your contemplated movements. The enemy know everything, or will know everything as soon as events are developed. They have quite as many adherents in this part of the country, as the Congress." "I am aware of it, and lament it!" said Washington, bitterly. "It was so in Delaware. The neutral and non-combating Qua- kers would give Sullivan no notice of the approach of Cornwallis, even if the withholding of it should cost the lives of a thousand men I Such is their neutrality and their horror of war! But, sir, you say the enemy are ordered to occupy New England. How is that? They do not possess it now." "It was supposed by Lord George Germain, at the date of his last despatches, that by this time General Burgoyne, in the north, would have formed a junction with the forces at New. York. In that event, New England must fall, like Philadelphia, into the hands of the British." "Perhaps; but neither has fallen yet-at least the former; and (, we must hope for the best. And after these important conquests';a are accomplished, they are to act on the defensive?" . "To await rather the result of the deliberations of the colo- nies." "And they would be in an excellent condition to wait, truly '" "I have also learned that there is to be a change in the generals. 17     194         TIE MONARCHST. Sir William Howe returns to England at his own request, be- cause his conduct in New Jersey did not quite meet the appro- bation of his Majesty. Sir Henry Clinton will succeed him." "It is not material to us who may command, if they be gentle-, men of humanity; and both Howe and Clinton are such. I suppose the latter, like the former, will be controlled by instructions from home. We must invoke the wisdom of Providence to guide us. In that I place my reliance! Farewell, sir," continued Wash- ington, looking at his watch; "I am about to mount my war- horse; and so you see we must part with no fairer sky above us." "We know not, sir, if a flood of brightness be not about to burst upon us. This may be the darkness preceding the day." "I hope so, truly!" said Washington, rising. Soon after the carriage of Mrs. Ferguson arrived in town, and the ill-fated letter was ultimately delivered, in despite of the ex- ertions of Wales to prevent it. And Washington, true to his prompt decision when first advised of its existence, laid it before Congress, and the poor clergyman was finally obliged to leave the country in consequence. The army crossed the Schuylkill that day, and on the next it stood in front of the British, drawn up in battle array under the eye of Washington, who had expressed a determination to direct its principal operations in person. He was piqued at the result of the encounter at Brandywine, and no persuasions on the pre- sent occasion could induce him to consent to retire to a place of safety while his subordinates executed his general orders. He felt an irresistible inclination to retrieve the credit of his arms by a superintendency of all the details of the action in person. He was brave, undoubtedly; but, on ordinary occasions he was not unmindful of the duty incumbent on him to provide for his personal security in any contingency. But this he regarded as an extraordinary occasion, and he referred the issue to that Pro- vidence which had so signally preserved him on former occasions, and particularly on the fatal field where Braddock fell. And Providence did preserve him and his army in a manner not at all to have been anticipated. Just before the signal was to have been given to commence the attack, both armies were deafened by the tremendous reports of God's artillery above. Two dark clouds had suddenly come in collision, and peal after peal of stunning thunder shook the earth. The livid flashes blinded the eyes and chilled the hearts of the boldest warriors. And then such inundating floods of rain were launched upon the embattled hosts, as had never been witnessed before. It defeated the expectations of both parties. There could not possibly be a   THE MONARCHST.         195 conflict of arms on that day, even when the sun shone fprth again, for the powder was utterly spoiled in all the cartridges which the men bore upon their persons. Washington, therefore, ordered a retreat immediately, and re- crossed the Schuylkill with all his army except General Wayne's division, which was posted in a thick wood, and had not been perceived by the enemy. This division was left for the purpose of cutting off a detachment of the enemy the next day, as it was naturally supposed the British army, when no longer me- naced by Washington, would not remain massed together in one body. And thus, in all probability was Washington, and the cause he advocated, rescued from destruction by a divine interposition; for it can'hardly be supposed that he would have been victorious over superior numbers, and regular troops, with an army consist- ing for the most part of undisciplined militia, and which had sus- tained a defeat only a few days before. But Wayne was not to escape oq such easy terms. If the farmers would give the Americans no information in regard to the position of the enemy, it was quite a different matter when intelligence in relation to the movements of the Americans might be serviceable to the British. Sir William Howe was soon in- formed of the snug cover where the-American general lay with his division; and the next day, instead of extending one of his wings merely to be handsomely clipped, he folded them both very lovingly round the wood, and almost entirely enclosed the Ameri- can detachment. Wayne soon understood how it was; but his heart did not fail him in the emergency. Perceiving the only opening-through which he might pass beyond the reach of the overwhelming num- bers, rapidly enveloping him, he made a furious assault in the opposite direction. As he supposed, the British general accumu- lated his forces at the point so furiously assailed, for it was ap- prehended that the Americans would attempt to break through the line and thus escape. * Wayne then, and his men, pushed on to the narrow opening; there was no other alternative. Custis lamented the necessity of such a precipitate flight; and Waples swore-not at the General-but at the luck, as he termed it. But so it was-Wayne got off with the loss of some two hundred men, while the British did not lose exceeding twenty. Sir William Howe now lost no time in directing his march towards Philadelphia. He had been astonished to find Washing- ton's army again drawn up in battle array before him, and thenceforward he grew extremely circumspect. He knew not     196        THE MONARCHST. how soon accessions from the north and the south might give the Americans the superiority in the field; and he had learned that Washington was not the one to despair under the effects of a series of reverses. He remembered that although he had driven him through New Jersey, without being checked in his career, the moment the pursuit ceased, the pursued general had turned upon him and chased him in turn. *.j   ,             ;THE MONARCHST.        197 CHAPTER XVI.

TiE advance of the British towards the city was no longer impeded by any obstacles interposed by Washington; and the American army deliberately retired up the Shuylkill, despond- ing somewhat, but not destroyed, as Sir William had hoped it would be. The British marched into the city down Second street. Many of the shops were kept open, and the inhabitants wore their finest dresses. They had been judiciously advised to make no exhibitions of alarm or grief, but rather to assume a cheerful aspect, even if they felt it not. Mr. Duche and the clergyman from Virginia met and wel- comed Sir William Howe to the city. Sir William greatly re- sembled Washington in features and stature, and many who beheld him at first declared it must be the American Commander- in-chief, who, they supposed, had joined the British army, and put on British regimentals. Many strange rumours agitated the people at that crisis. But they were to be soon undeceived. Sir William Howe made free with Mrs. Pemberton's fine coach, and soon after billeted himself at her stately mansion, at the corner of Third and Chestnut streets. This was condemned by the officers generally, as Mr. Pemberton was known to be in durance at the time for his real or supposed opposition to the acts of Congress in regard to independence. Lord Howe, the commander of the fleet, and elder brother of Sir William, was more amiable in his disposition and sociable in his manners. But he, too, selected very comfortable quarters at Isaac Norris's fine mansion in Chestnut street, where the United States Bank was subsequently erected. Attached to the man- 17*     198         THE MONARCHST. sion were beautiful pleasure grounds and gardens, where his lordship frequently entertained his friends. Lord Cornwallis was a short, thick, good-humoured English- man, and exceedingly sociable and condescending. His lodgings were in the fine house in High street, subsequently occupied by. Washington. It is now called Tower Hall, being donverted into a clothing warehouse. Sir Henry Clinton, soon to succeed Sir William Howe in the chief command, was short and fat, but very reserved in his speech. General Kniphausen, the leader of the Hessians, was tall and straight, and was so polite that he bowed at almost every sen- tence he uttered. And yet he always buttered his bread with his thumb! Colonel Tarleton was short, broad-chested, and muscular. His legs and arms were large; his face dark, and his eyes small, piercing, and black. Sir William Erskine, Sir Henry Calder, and General Sterne, were refined gentlemen in every sense of the word, and seemed to make it their particular duty, as well as pleasure, to protect the inhabitants from every species of insult and ill-treatment. Colonel Ralph Abercrombie (who so gloriously fell in Egypt in 1801) had lodgings in Vine street, at the house of one of the well-affected Quakers. Indeed most of the British officers had numerous invitations to become the guests of opulent families. Major Andr6 occupied the house belonging to Dr. Franklin, between Chestnut and High streets. The Hon. Cosmo Gordon, Colonel O'Harra, Count Donop, Colonel John Reid (expert with the flute), Sir John Wrottlesby, Major Gardiner, Captain Montresor, &c., were distributed mostly in the then fine residences in Second street. Captain Sparks took lodgings at Mrs. Pearson's, a milliner, and fell in love with and married one of her daughters. But the most amusing incident in the distribution of officers, was the billeting of Parson Badger, a merry British chaplain, at the house of John Fields, a very devout Quaker, and-an exhorter, who subsequently became much shocked at what he termed the enormity of the doctrines of the church, and the loose morals of the parsons. Galloway, the Quaker lawyer, and who had been a member of Congress before his desertion of the American cause, was made superintendent of police; and John \Roberts and Abram Car- lisle, also Quakers, were constituted the umpires to decide who   THE MONARCHST.         199 might pass the gates fixed at the ends of the streets, and to say who were well or ill-affected to the British cause. But the most obnoxious, if not the most noted tory attending the British, was Captain Cunningham. He was an old Irishman of herculean dimensions, who had emigrated originally to North Carolina, and upon the breaking out of the war had joined the royal standard. He was made superintendent of the Walnut street prison, and had in custody the prisoners taken at Brandy- wine, Germantown, &c., and evinced his zeal for the cause he had espoused by his cruelty to the unfortunate captives com- mitted to his charge. The British troops, though mostly left at Germantown, were nevertheless distributed in a line extending, with intervals, into the city. There were barracks up Second street; and even the beautiful pleasure grounds of Mr. Bingham were used once a week as parade grounds, to the great detriment of the grass and shrubbery. No sooner had the British become settled in the city, and quite comfortable, than they sought (in accordance with the na- tional propensity) to institute a series of amusements as some compensation for the privations of the campaign just ended. There were no players in the city, although there was a theatre of moderate dimensions. No matter; amateur actors would be equally diverting; and Rivington's Gazette soon gave notice of a performance for the benefit of the wounded, and the widows and orphans of the slain, in the recent battle. The parts were to be filled by names of high rank in the army, and young officers of noble birth. Major Andr6 and Captain Delancy were the scene- painters, as well as very creditable actors. The Quakers were much shocked at the proposition; but were silent when it was announced that the proceeds were to be dis- tributed in charity. There was no difficulty in filling the house with the fashion and beauty of the city; and perhaps no actors were ever more heartily applauded. Even Flora herself, her father and mother, Miss Custis, and the two clergymen from .Virginia, were often present. Flora, contrary to the expectations of every one who had witnessed her recent distress, and almost distraction, was neither the victim of illness nor of misanthropic gloom. On the contrary, within a week after the burial of Percy, a remarkable change seemed to have taken place in her nature. Although paler and thinner than usual, she was far more vivacious, and apparently more joyous, than she had ever been before. Undoubtedly this exhi-     200         THE MONARCHST. bition of hilarity was merely upon the surface, and must have been the result of a powerful effort to seem gay, and indifherent to her late affliction; but nevertheless to those who knew not her secret, her manners and speech appeared to be far more fas- cinating than formerly. When Major Andre, therefore, solicited the pleasure of con. ducting her to the theatre, she readily consented, and even went so far as to intimate that she would have no objection to partici- pate in the performances, provided some half-dozen other ladies of her acquaintance would do the same. This was going rather too far, and was decided to be impracticable. "No matter, then," she said, when the objections of others were made known. "Do with me as you please; I am at your command. Give the signal when you want applause (for I am sometimes absent in mind, dreaming of my dear native Scotland, to which I am going to return), and my hands shall be. emnloyed in your service." At the theatre it was a doubtful contest between Miss Franks and Flora, who should bear off the palm of admiration. Flora astonished every one with her unaccustomed and unexpected sallies of wit and sarcasm. Miss Franks herself was surprised at the change; but 'the rivalry did not beget, as is sometimes the case, any feelings of envious animosity between them. It was on one of these occasions that Flora, turning abruptly to one of the city gallants, who ventured to amuse 'her while Andr6 was behind the scenes, asked the interpretation of the motto over the stage, "Totus mundus agit histrionem," and was answered, after some hesitation, " Oh, it is merely We act Mon.- days, Wednesdays, and Thursdays." This, when repeated be- hind the scenes, produced such an explosion of laughter, that Sir Henry Clinton, who occupied a box near the stage, called the actors to order. It was near the termination of one of these entertainments, and they were generally prolonged until a late hour, that Sir William IIowe received intelligence, by means of one of his spies, of pre- parations for a movement in the American camp. He withdrew Immediately, and summoned his officers then in the city, and nearly all of them of high rank were there, to meet him without delay at his rooms. He was much agitated, and uttered only brief and hasty sentences in the ear, of Mrs. Ferguson, as he con- ducted her home in his (Mr. Pemberton's) carriage. At Mrs. Darrah's, Andre would have parted with his captivat- ing companion, after brief adieux. "  The lights are gleaming within," said Flora, detaining him;   THE MONARCHST.         201 "why such haste? I could tell you a tale of a midnight scene in that parlour, wherein a gallant young officer played a silent part, which would not make you laugh." Andre felt a chill at his heart, for he had heard of the circum- stance, and he now feared, with others, that Flora, notwithstand- ing her seeming gayety, had not recovered from the wound in- flicted on her heart by the fall of Percy. "But duty calls me away. Did you not observe the mes- senger from Sir William? Another time, my fair royalist, I shall be wholly yours!" "Wholly mine! I pray God you be not brought hither as --no matter! When you will; you shall be welcome, Major. We poor exiles in a strange land must amuse and comfort each other as well as we can. Now, to bed, and to sleep. To sleep? I hope so. But where will you rest to-night? Such a question, and to a soldier! I pray it be not on some humid field, with the stars weeping over you. I, too, will weep, sir, if you fall. At least I Will endeavour to do so. Though I could not-- no matter! Fare thee well i" But Ann had a more accommodating beau in the person of Colo- nel Tarleton, who had not intimated that he had a family at home. "As my men can travel faster than the infantry," said the burly colonel, "I need be in no hurry. I can sit till sunrise, and then overtake the snails before breakfast.; Have you no nice little talefor me?" he asked of Ann, who had relinquished his arm, and had not solicited his further attendance. "None, whatever, sir. I am wearied, and have a pain in my head." "And is there no pain in the heart? It seems to me some one, somewhere, whispered that there was a soft youth in the rebel camp, who aspired-- "A soft youth!" said Flora, turning to the Colonel, after Andr6 had hastened away; "beware that you do not exchange hard blows with him! You will not find him so soft and gentle as you seem to suppose." "Do you know him?" asked Tarleton. Oh, yes; quite well; but I cannot say I like him as well as another young lady does. Yet he is brave enough, and honesty and all that; but he is a rebel." "And that blackens him all over!" said Tarleton. "In your estimation," added Ann, coldly; "but not, perhaps, in the estimation of quite as valiant soldiers as yourself, in the King's army." "No doubt, no doubt, Miss Custis, it is as you say. I would     202         THE MONARCHST. not seriously speak ill of the absent. But I shall make his ac- quaintance some day, perhaps, and will then be able to give you my candid opinion of his merits." "Very well. But if you mean that the field of battle shall be the scene of your meeting, it might be well to remember the warning of Miss Kingsburgh. She is gifted almost with powers of the second-sight. Adieu, colonel!" The ladies entered the house, while the rebuked officer strode in the direction of the quarters of the Commander-in-chief. Horses were prancing in the streets, and rattling drums were heard in different directions. Another messenger (or spy) had brought such intelligence as left no other inference on Sir Wil- liam's mind than that Washington, still uneasy and discontented, was about to attempt a desperate enterprise against the British detachment at Germantown. And as the last news indicated that the Americans were in full march towards that point, and not further distant from it than he was himself, Sir William's impatience to fly to its relief was very natural, and could not be restrained. "This is rather early rising, Sir. William," said General Agnew; "they will not let us sleep at night, and yet they refuse to fight us in the daytime." "Day or night, General," repliedSir William, r Washington must be watched closely at all times, and promptly met, or else our victories will turn to dust and ashes in our hands." Little did the brave General Agnew think his next sleep would be pro- longed until he was awakened from it by the last trumpet, at the end of time. The field officers accompanied the Commander-in chief to Germantown. The troops in the city were to follow with all possible expedition. The day was just beginning to dawn when Sir William approached the town, and with its earliest light, the battle began. The report of musketry and the whistling of bullets saluted the ears of the group of officers as they entered the village. This was startling enough; but to make matters still worse, and to render their doubts and anxieties more intense a thick fog arose from the neighbouring marshes and meadows, which, when combined with 'the smoke of the small arms, that would not rise in the thick atmosphere, became nearly impene- trable to the vision. Objects could not be distinguished at a distance of fifty paces. The British Commander-in-chief, before he had traversed one- half the distance from his entrance into the town to where the greater portion of his forces had been established the preceding   THE MONARCHST.          203 day, was met by several of his regiments in a brisk retreat. a  These he succeeded in arresting; and upon information being spread through the ranks, that the regiments in the city were marching to their assistance, a stand was made, and ultimately the tide turned against the assaulting army. But the main inci- dent, which contributed most to produce the ultimate result, was the skilful movement of Colonel Musgrave, in taking position in Chew's house with six companies of infantry. Up to this moment everything promised complete success to the American arms. The enterprise was well planned, and there was no deficiency in nerve or precision in carrying it into exe- cution. Had it succeeded, the British must have evacuated the city immediately. But Providence had not so ordered it. The unforeseen resistance at Chew's house; the fog; and a little too much ardour on the part of Lord Sterling (under whose command Washington had placed the Virginians), whose failing was a too great indulgence in generous wine, were, when combined, sufficient impediments to frustrate the hopes, and render unavailing the exertions of the American Commander-in- chief. Washington was upon the ground himself, and often ex- posed to imminent danger. His troops implored him to retire beyond the reach of the enemy's fire; and once they seized the bit of his horse, and forcibly led him aside from the range of their cannon. The attack being made by separate columns, in front, flank, and rear simultaneously, it was utterly impossible in- the con- fusion immediately succeeding the surprise (and the surprise was complete), to distinguish friends from enemies. That portion of the American troops which were advanced beyond Chew's house, supposed, from the firing in that direction, that the British had charged the columns under Sullivan and Greene; while the British under arms in the field where they had first been formed, be- lieved themselves to be almost completely surrounded, and in the midst of the panic which ensued, they commenced the retreat which Sir William was fortunate enough to arrest. In the confusion and darkness of the hour, many ludicrous oc- currences transpired. Regiments surrendered to companies, and the prisoners were conducted by mistake directly to their own side of the field, where the captors in turn were taken. Brigades retired before charging regiments. But the most melancholy errors committed were the instances in which whole battalions fired upon their own friends. And when, at last, Washington despaired of success, and gave orders for the army to retire, several regiments in the confusion had become detached from     204         THE MONARCHST. their divisions, and continued the conflict after the greater part of the army was in full retreat. This was the case with Colonel Matthews's regiment in par- ticular, in which, by special request, Custis and Waples were permitted to have the command of a company whose captain and lieutenant were disabled. This regiment continued to advance, and to fire, long after the column to which it belonged had left the field. It was impossible in the obscurity which prevailed to communicate orders with precision; it was likewise out of the power of the enemy to perceive that Washington had withdrawn the most of his forces; and hence the troops under Matthews were supposed to be the van of an attacking column. On they charged, while those opposed to them gave way, with the ex- ception of a battalion which surrendered. As usual, when they laid down their arms, the Americans uttered a shout. 'This was a most unfortunate occurrence; for just then Sir William, at the head of a brigade which he was leading into the action, was at- tracted by the sound, and perceiving from his proximity, and by the gradual dispersion of the mist, that there was but a soli- tary regiment of the enemy opposed to him, he executed a ma- noeuvre which had the effect of almost entirely surrounding it. He ordered the men not to fire. This circumstance caused the Virginians to believe at first that it was an American brigade, and they approached it with exultation, which was suddenly to be changed to despair. "By Jove, they are the British!" cried Matthews, and an order to retreat was instantly given. But whichever way they turned, they were confronted with a horizontal rampart of mus- kets with fixed bayonets. The prisoners were abandoned. Con- fusion seized upon the men. The ranks were broken, and each one sought to make his own escape. Unfortunately but few succeeded. There was, however, a narrow ravine on the left, where no British bayonets seemed to oppose the passage; land although the small path that led through it was not exactly the direction one would have chosen to escape from the enemy's clutches, yet Custis and Waples pursued it, in hopes that the thread of fog, still meandering the rivulet, might shield them from observation. They had not progressed very far before the banks of the ravine became further hpart, and finally disappeared altogether. They were now entering a small moist meadow, upon which the fog lingered in greater density than in the higher ground. "Stop!" whispered Waples, seizing the arm of his companion.   THE MONARCHST.          205 "I thought I heard the voices of men directly before us. Let us stoop down; we may be able to see them." They prostrated themselves, and gazed steadily for some mo- ments. The fog was rising slowly, and for a foot above the sur- face of the earth the atmosphere was quite transparent. As they lay there, a spectacle was presented to their vision which would have dismayed hearts less bold than theirs. Not forty paces dis- tant, and directly in front of them, could be distinguished the feet and legs of a line of the enemy, stationed there, doubtless, to catch stragglers. The line was formed across the path, and seemed to extend a considerable distance both to the right and left of it. They could not see its termination on either hand, owing to the inequalities of the ground. But there was evidently no possible means of escape, except by getting round the ends of it unperceived. And this they resolved to attempt. Yet they perceived the sounds they had heard did not come from the line of motionless and silent men, but from a flock of gabbling geese, which were sitting upon the grassy margin of a small pool, and apparently engaged in a low conversation. Every one ]nows the similarity of sound, at a short distance, between the gabble of a gander and the human voice. Custis deemed this discovery a fortunate circumstance; but Waples shook his head in doubt.  There was, however, no time for prolonged deliberation; and so the companions, after a brief conference, agreed to separate at the pool, and, if successful in getting round, to meet in the rear of the enemy. They rose up cautiously and moved briskly, but with as little noise as possible, until within a few paces of the pool, where the peaceful flock of geese were reposing. But just when they were clasping hands in a silent adieu, for they could not but be aware that they might not meet again on this side of Jordan,* the hitherto quiet flock of geese, led on by an enormous white gander, assailed their startled ears with such hisses and squalls, that the attention of the enemy was attracted to the spot, and a file of soldiers advanced quickly towards them. "D--n the geese!" said Waples, in a tone of vexation. "Hush!" said Custis. "There is no use in it," replied Waples, throwing down his sword, "unless we choose to run the gauntlet of a hundred car- tridges. Don't you see them coming in every direction? We are in the bag of the net, fishes or partridges, whichever you * An expression much used at' the time by Washington. 18     206        THE MONARCHST. please, and there is no escape for us. D-n the geese, I say still!' "Surrender!" cried Captain Montresor, advancing at the head of his company. "We have surrendered, sir!" said Waples, "but not to you. The honour was reserved for another." "To whom have you surrendered?" "We know not the sponsorial name of our vanquisher," said Custis, laughing, "but his patronymic is famous in history, for one of his ancestors saved Rome. You may see him there, with all his host trampling upon our arms." This was followed by laughter, in which Montresor heartily joined. "I commiserate you, gentlemen," said he, "and could wish the honour had fallen to the lot of some other member of his Majesty's military family. But since your submission has been so complete, I will take it upon myself, with the acquiescence of your valiant captors, to permit you to resume your swords. You will be kind enough to give me your names." This was done. And Montresor remembered to have heard his friend Percy mention them as brave young gentlemen, but decided rebels. This, however, did not prevent him from treating them with respect, or from seeking to cultivate their acquaintance, when he resumed his station, awaiting the approach of more stragglers. From him Custis and Waples learned the manner of Percy's death, the particulars of his vision, and the subsequent effects produced on the mind of Flor, who they supposed would be the victim of a gnawing melancholy. Waples likewise heard news of Ann, whom Montresor had seen. But he found no pleasure in the information that Colonel Tarleton was a frequent visiter at Mrs. Darrah's house, and had on more than one occasion ac- corrpanied Miss Custis to the theatre. By this time the firing had ceased in every direction. The detachment which had been sent in pursuit of Washington, having received several well-directed fires from Morgan's rifle- men, was so completely staggered by the fatal effects of their aim, that they were ordered ;back, and the Americans were suf- fered to retire without further molestation. Our brace of prisoners being conducted to Mr. Wistar's house, they had the melancholy satisfaction, if satisfaction it could be called, to behold, in the parlour where they had been admitted into the presence of their own General a few days before, the ,prostrate form of General Agnew, who was then in the agony   THE MONARCHST.          207 of death. He had been cruelly shot by an amateur marksman, after the battle.* But hundreds had fallen on either side in the murderous conflict. If Washington, as it has been so often reported was his' custom, had bowed his knees in prayer for success on that occa- sion, it is no less true, for nothing could be better authenticated, that he vented a few bitter execrations against Lord Stirling as he retreated from the scene of his defeat towards Skippack creek. But his passion was of short duration, and he never sought to have those whose conduct had been reprehensible that day brought to punishment. He justly attributed their failings to physical infirmities, and not errors of design; and he was content to withhold from them commands in the future which they might prove incompetent to fulfil. The repulsed, but not wholly desponding Commander-in-chief pursued his retrograde amarch a considerable distance without halting. 'He was weary and pale. At eve he paused for a mo- ment at Mr. B. Marshall's house, and partook of a cup of tea which was tendered him. No bread was baked, and he could not delay his march until it might be prepared. But he took the half of a biscuit from the deep pocket of his long waistcoat, and declared to Mrs. Marshall that the other half was all he had eaten since the preceding day! * This, perhaps unjustifiable, action was performed by Hans P. Boyer, who lay in ambush. Boyer died fifty years afterward in the almshouse. The practice of marking high officers for victims on such occasions, seems to be condemned by civilized nations.                f .     208         THE MONARCHTST. CHAPTER XVII. The lonely captives' hearts beat high; No tyrant's rage may make them sigh; For often hath the tale been told Of fortune favouring the bold. CUSTIS and Waples were now in a predicament which, above almost all others in the chapter of accidents, they would have relished the least. Wounds they could have borne with more patience; defeat they had become accustomed to; but the loss of liberty of locomotion was a grievance they had never contem- plated. They had obtained a promise from Montresor to have a letter they had written conveyed to Washington by the next flag sent to the American camp; and hoping to be exchanged very soon. they had resolved for the present not to have their condition made known to their friends in the city. They were to be sadly disappointed. Washington, never swayed in his public duties. by considerations of a private nature wrote in answer to their request, that the rule adopted in negotiating exchanges, was to effect the enfranchisement of prisoners in accordance with the dates of their capture; that is, those first taken were to be ex- changed first; and, as he had few or no prisoners in his custody, the prospect of an exchange of his young friends was rather remote to be pleasant. He sympathised with them sincerely; but he could do nothing more. Sympathy they did not require; indeed, so impetuous and self-relying were they that the word rather offended them. But they had declined the proposition of Montresor, to effect their release upon their parole not to serve against the King again during the war. Custis, who had already served beyond the period he had fixed upon to return to Virginia, had been willing to receive his freedom on such terms; but as Waples was prompt in his decision not to subscribe to them, he, too, determined to share his fortune. The grievances of confinement in the Walnut street prison were heightened and aggravated by the savage nature of the Provost-marshal, Captain Cuningham, the old herculean Irish   THE MONARCHIST.         209 tory from North Carolina. He absolutely withheld from his prisoners their allowances of food, and some of them were reduced to the verge of starvation. He even intercepted the food bought by such of the prisoners as happened to have a little money when taken. To so great an extent had the deprivation of the usual sustenance of life reduced some of the poor men, that they watched the holes in their cells like cats, and actu- ally became expert at catching rats, which they contrived to have cooked for them. It is true the prisoners were sometimes visited by the humane citizens, and on such occasions it must be admitted that the Quakers, with few exceptions, performed their offices of mercy without regard to the merits or demerits of the recipients of their bounty. Likewise the wounded of both armies, were comforted and healed indiscriminately by the ladies of that persuasion, as well as by other classes of the community. Yet it must be stated that Cunningham generally accompanied the visitors to the prisoners under his charge, and marked every complaint; and those who made statements disagreeable to his ears, were not likely to experience any diminution of their grievances. The fact that Captain Montresor occasionally called on the two young officers from Virginia, seemed hitherto to have protected them from the effects of Cunningham's brutality. But that circumstance, it seemed, was not always to secure them an ipmunity. from the outrages of which their fellow captives were the daily victims. One day the report of cannon being heard, the prisoners were informed by the sentinels guarding them in the contracted walk they were allowed at certain hours, that it was an attack upon forts Mercer and Mifflin, below the city, which had still held out 'against the enemy, and prevented the junction of the fleet and the army. But the poor prisoners could obtain no information of the probabilities of success during the pr6gress of the assault. At last a tremendous explosion, which seemed to shake the foundations of the earth, and actually fractured the glass in the windows of the prison, announced some great occurrence. "It cannot be any of our magazines," said Waples. "No," replied Custis; we have not powder enough to pro- duce such an explosion." "It must be one of the British men-of-war." One of the guards whose sympathies were on the side of the Americans, and who subsequently deserted to them, having learned it was the blowing up of the Augusta, whispered his in- formation to one of the prisoners. The news ran from one end 18*          .         ^     210         THl MONARCHST. of the prison to the other, and was succeeded by a general shout of triumph. Immediately afterwards Cuningham made his appearance, ap- parently convulsed with rage. He called several of his men to him and ordered them to lash the prisoners into silence. He was partially obeyed. The lash was applied to more than forty of the captives. "I think your turn comes next," said he, glancing furiously at Custis and Waples. "To be lashed?" asked Custis. "Yes, to be lashed, sir; what else could it be, unless it was to stretch your d-d rebel necks." "I think you must be labouring under a slight mistake," re- plied Custis, his lips quivering with indignation. "We'll see, by the powers! come here, sir;" he continued, beckoning forward one of the men who had been using the cat. "You dare not do it, sir!" exclaimed Waples. "I dare not?" "Do it at your peril!" continued Waples. C If he strikes either of us a blow, depend upon it, it will cost you your life I If we have not the means of taking it here (and we will try) we will follow you through the world for vengeance. We will not care for consequences: have us once whipped, and the object we shall live for will be to take your life. We will do it, sir, in the midst of your own company-or even, if need be, in the pri- sence of King George upon lis throne!" The tyrant was awed for a moment; but not by any means willing to relinquish his purpose of inflicting some species of de- grading punishment on his defiant captives. After a short re- flection he ordered a sergeant to put the young men in irons "We will not submit to that, either!" said Custis; "tlH one who attempts to obey that order, will have to struggle for it," he continued, snatching up a heavy stool, which he brandished threateningly. "You can have no authority to treat us in this manner," said Waples; "you forget we are prisoners of war; and that the fortune of the next battle may throw you into our hands, and then retaliation would be a duty." "You are not to instruct me in my duty, by J- !" continued aunningham.   ( Seize them, I say!" "At your peril!" said the young men, assuming positions of defence. At that instant Master Robert Wales entered, and placed a note from Sir William Howe in the hands of the enraged Pro-   THE MONARCHST.         2" vost-marshal.  That functionary read the note, and then gazed at the composed features of the diminitive personage before him. i He looked from one to the other, several times, as if in doubt of the reality of what he beheld. Being at length convinced it was really so, he sullenly remarked that the wishes of Sir Wil- liam should be complied with. The note stated that the bearer, Master Robert Wales, was not only to have ingress and egress at all times, but was to be permitted, for certain reasons it was not necessary to specify, to liberate any private, or- officer under the rank of captain, upon signing a discharge for him, giving his name in full, and describing accurately his person. Sir William likewise enjoined it upon Cunningham to show the bearer, when- ever he might present himself, polite attentions, and to facilitate his objects whatever they might be, without question or demur- rer, as he was a person in the full enjoyment of the confidence of the Commander-in-chief. Wales had bowed very politely to the young officers, who, in returning the salutation, mentioned his name; and Cunningham, upon perceiving they were acquainted with the bearer of the ex-. traordinary note from Sir William, could not avoid evincing the chagrin attendant upon the sudden disappointment of his desire of inflicting a summary chastisement. i "There are some traces of recent excitement in your faces, gentlemen," said Wales, "as well as in your attitudes," he con- tinued, seeing Waples in a defensive position, and Custis with the stool still half brandished in his hand. And' there might have been traces of another kind, and in another place, if you had not interrupted us," said Waples, fix- ing his eye fiercely upon his keeper. "I..see no reason why there should not be traces on your wrists:, yet," said Cunningham, once more perusing the note. "There is nothing here which forbids ironing mutineers or un- controllable prisoners." "We were acting on the defensive, sir," said Custis. "The saints preserve us!" exclaimed Cunningham, lifting up his hands. "Sergeant Carey!" he continued, "Did you ever hear such impudence?" "Faith, I think not, sir!" responded the sergeant, touching his hat. ' And they have the impudence-" "Cease, sir!" said Custis; "1 will not permit you to use such language in reference to me. I am an officer, and, I hope, a gentleman; and it can be no part of your duty to apply to me any such epithets."     212      -  THE MONARCHST. "Sergeant Carey," - continued Cunningham, " you can. bear witness that these men were disorderly, and would not submit to the rules of the prison." Carey, however, remained silent. "He cannot do it!" said Waples, " for it was not so." "Not so?" "No, sir; and if you say it was, you are a deliberate liar!" "Hold! hold, sir!" said Master Robert, interposing before the menacing Provost-marshal, who seemed to be in the act of. assaulting the prisoner. "I desire to have some conversation with the prisoners, alone and immediately. Does Sir William's note embrace the granting of such a request?" Cunningham read it once more, and hesitated. "aOh, if it does not, I will see him again without delay, and have another." "I believe it does, sir," said Cunningham. "I likewise desire to have these gentlemen placed in one of the comfortable rooms I saw unoccupied on the left of the great entrance." "Very well, sir!" was the surly response. No time was lost in conducting the young men from the filthy cell in which they had been confined by the special order of the tyrannical Provost, because they had refused to pay him a bonus for more comfortable quarters.  "Master Bob," said Custis, when seated in his new apart. ment, "you have done us a service for which we thank you." "Come, no thanks, boys; were you not my pupils? What if we have quarrelled occasionally? It only increases my affec- tion for you. If there is anything else I can do for you, name it without hesitation. You see I have some influence with Sir William, and it will be a pleasure for me to alleviate the pangs of your imprisonment." "First, tell us how you learned we had been taken," said Waples. The list of prisoners is open for my inspection when I desire to see it," said Wales. "You have not mentioned it to-to-any one else, I hope?" continued Waples. "No; they know nothing about it. But how long do you intend to remain here? Why not come out and be free?" "How?" asked  aples. "We might, indeed, be liberated through the influence of our generous captor, Montresor, by pledging ourselves not to bear arms again; but then we would not be free."   THE MONARCHST.         213 I  "You allude to the cause; I to your persons. We will not discuss the former now. Yet, how can you serve it in your pre- sent condition? And how can you change your condition on any other terms than those whick you have hinted at?" Oh, if I were alone, I would not remain in captivity long." "How is that, Sam?" asked Custis. "Am I an encumbrance to you?" Oh, no; I merely meant that I could escape, if alone." "I will not hinder you." I know it; but I will not leave you; and both cannot, per- haps, escape." "These walls seem strong," said Wales, smiling, and looking round. "No matter; you will not require me to make you my con- fidant." "By no means; but I could wish to be made your liberator, on the terms Montresor suggested." "I will not consent to it." "Nor I, then," said Custis. "Recall that," said Master Robert. "Your companion says he could escape, if left alone. I' do not say so. But there is another reason why you should extricate yourself from this dilemma." "What is it?" "Your presence is required in Virginia-or rather it may be soon, if my calculations be correct." "Why so?" "I will inform you before long. But I advise you not to make up your mind to remain here until the end of the war, which may be very, very far off." "Good advice, that, Tom," said Waples; "and, by your leave, I will appropriate a portion of it to myself. If the war lasts two months longer, I will not remain here until its termintition." "So you think, Captain!" responded Wales, archly. 'Waples had been called captain since leading a company at German- town. "Master Bob, Ill wager you a guinea I escape in a fort- night." "Very well. But how did you relish your oison? I fear it was not very savoury, else you had acknowledged the compli- ment." Relish the what?" "The oison. The French for goslin---that is the mode now." "Your French oison sounds like poison to me. And if it     214         THE MONARCHST. really means goslin, you might suppose it tasted like it, if you knew a little more of my history." "I know a little more than you suppose. In plain English, then, Miss Franks having learned from Captain Montresor, that the prisoners were catching rats, and eating them too, as the Provost says to mortify him, employed Mr. B. Lehman, for hard money, to procure her a fine fat goslin from GermantoWn; this she had cooked in the most approved fashion, with all the condi- ments usually attending so delicate a dish, and sent it to you last week. She says she received no acknowledgment of the kindness." "The villanous Provost seized it, and ate it himself. I wish it had been poison in his belly! And so Captain Montresor has told that tale himself! Well, if he has no objection, I shall have none. The geese were our captors, not he. But, be good enough, by all means, to make our acknowledgments to the lady; and say to her that Cunningham stole our goose; that we saw neither it nor the messenger. And be pleased to request her, in my name, and on my responsibility, to do me the especial favour to procure and send hither a pheasant, temptingly cooked, but with a dilution of twenty grains of tartar emetic mixed with the gravy. She shall have my thanks in advance, and for ever; and I will not taste a morsel of it." "It shall be done," said Wales, retiring. And it was done. The very next day the herculean frame of the old cormorant Provost was shaken to its foundations. The surgeons were sent for in great haste. Custis and Waples had the exquisite delight to be within hearing of the groans and retchings of their well-punished enemy; and they could not A*  resist the temptation of sending in their very kind inquiries after the health of their poor jailor. The doctors at once pronouced it a case of poisoning; and the frightened patient yelled in agony of mind and body, as he sub- mitted to their scarcely less painful remedies. Never again were any of the dishes sent to the prisoners intercepted by the pro- vost!   THE MONARCHST.         215 CHAPTER XVIII. *    *    *    * He who wins may laugh, they say, He fight again who runs away, And Justice still will win the day. *    *    *    * 4 SOME ten or fifteen officers were assembled at the quarters of Lord Howe (the mansion of I. Norris), consulting in regard to a series of splendid entertainments about to be given in honour of his Lordship's brother, Sir William, who was soon to sail for England. When the arrangements were decided upon, the com- pany partook, as usual, very abundantly of his Lordship's wines, and remained until a late hour in the evening engaged in plea- sant conversation. "And so," said the usually taciturn Sir Henry Clinton, who had been' appointed Sir William's successor in the chief com- mand, "the Pretender, I learn by my letters, is coming upon the scene again. If we are to have a French war likewise, that vagabond prince may play the devil with the calculations of some of us yet." "I scarcely think so, Sir Harry," replied Lord Howe. He has been married, it is true, to the Princess Stolberg, who is young enough; but he is too old, or at least too much enfeebled by his dissipations to prolong the pretensions of his nearly de- funct family. At all events I am credibly informed by Sir Horace Mann, at Florence, who has the best opportunity of ob- taining accurate intelligence, that there is not the slightest pros- pect of a prolongation of his race." It will be like the effort to prolong the race of the Medici," said Lord Cornwallis. "The last Gaston was a cardinal, but had a dispensation to marry. His wife was young and beautiful, and, unluckily, impregnably virtuous while he lived. No consider- ations of policy; no temptations of the handsomest young nobles and pages of Europe thrown in the way, would suffice. But when her lord had been dead about a year, her mind seemed to have changed. Heirs were multiplied rapidly enough; but the Medici were extinct." "But the Pretender has also acknowledged, or will, I am     216         TIIE MONARCHST. informed," said Sir Henry, "acknowledge the legitimacy of his putative daughter in Paris." e may acknowledge her, and I believe he has done it, and likewise bestowed upon her the title of Countess d'Albany," said Lord Howe " but she is nearly forty, and altogetherpassd. There is no hope from that source. The only chance of pro- longing the Stuarts, would be the success of an experiment similar to that just named. The Duke of York, as he is called and,now a cardinal, it may be presumed from his office and habits, might possess more of the stamina of existence than his brother Charles." "But, seriously," said Lord Cornwallis, "the Hanoverian family are encouraging these spasmodic efforts of the Stuarts. It appears that His Grace of Gloucester, the King's brother, has contracted a private marriage with lady Waldegrave, a widow, with nearly a half-dozen children, much to the discontent of the court. And the Duke of Cumberland, the other brother, has run off with and married another widow, a Mrs. Horton, of no enviable reputation. These marriages may not be legalized. If so, and His Majesty's offspring should fail, old England must pick up a sovereign wherever she can find one." "Oh, they will be as plenty as blackbirds," said Sir Henry Calder. The Fitz James's, the illegitimate descendants of James II., are, it seems, already arranging the succession. I believe' there are, at this moment, more than a hundred left-handed Stuarts in the kingdom." "When leverets cease to be produced in the realm," said Colonel Tarleton, '" we may look for the Hanoverian descendants of Princess Sophia to fail in propagation. The dikes of Dutch- land seem to have a most wonderful effect upon the productions of our soil when transplanted thither. Why, his Majesty is absolutely counting one a year! How can there be the slightest apprehension of a scarcity of progeny? Did not the King give Sir James Louther the start and beat him? The day after his wedding, he knew Lord Bute would win his bet, and wanted to go halves with him." "The letters which entertain me most, are those giving accounts of the Duchess of Kingston's case," said Lord Howe. "The old woman, for she is upwards of fifty, would marry again, they say, were it not for the pending trial." "If ustice be awarded," said Sir Henry Clinton, " she will be branded for her crimes." "Pardon me, Sir Harry," said Tarleton, "if I cannot agree with you. Her marriage with Lord Bristol, was I think, a sort   THE MONARCHST.    ,     217 of conditional agreement; or rather a treaty of alliance provided it should prove agreeable to both parties. It did not please either. His lordship feared her violence of temper would some day cause her to take his life, and was willing to separate on certain terms. His Grace of Kingston wanted to marry her; and thus she was enabled to comply with her first lord's con- ditions. There had been no issue, no cohabitation, and no one was injured, or had a right to complain. The priest was put out of the way, and the record of the marriage destroyed. Hence, I say, they might afford to let her Grace alone. Perhaps, as she rises every time, the next marriage may be with some one of the royal blood, and it may ultimately produce more aspirants for the crown." This was followed by hearty laughter, and it was remarked that the Colonel ought to sit in the Ecclesiastical Court, and hear the case pleaded by Lord Mansfield. Lord M. was the Duchess's counsel, but she was really convicted of bigamy. "I find a very melancholy event detailed in one of my let- ters," said Colonel Abercrombie. My Lord Harcourt has met with a singular death?" "Death?" cried several, who then learned of his demise the first time. "Ay, and a strange one. It occurred at his estate of Nune- ham Park. he was in the habit of making frequent solitary rambles on foot. On one of these occasions his favourite dog fell into a well; and his Lordship, in endeavouring to extricate him, fell in likewise, and head foremost. He could not turn, and so was drowned." "And the dog, too?" asked Tarleton. "No. The dog was found alive, and perched upon his Lord- ship's feet." "I have a letter," said General Knyphausen, "intimating that we are; to be reinforced with fifteen thousand Russians." "And I have one," said Sir Harry Clinton, "contradicting that rumor. Mine is from Lord George Germain." "Who ought to know," said Colonel O'Harra. At this point several of the younger officers entered, accom- panied by Dr. Hautonville, a British surgeon. "How is your patient, Doctor '" asked Sir Henry. Cunningham had been reported as being in a dying condition. "He is doing very well, now, your Excellency," said the Doctor, smiling; " but he suffered a great deal. I think he has the most capacious stomach in the army." "And it is to be presumed, Doctor," said Lord Howe, "that 19     ZiaQ     TTHE MONARCHST. what with your cathartics and emetics, you have had an excel- lent opportunity of measuring its capacity." "Your lordship may suppose I sounded it to its bottom. But after all there was really no necessity for my services." "Why not?" asked Sir Henry; "I had reason to believe he was dangerously ill-almost in extremis." "I will explain his case to your Excellency. When I ar- rived I found, I must confess, symptoms which alarmed me. It was apparent that something deleterious had been swallowed b accident or otherwise. I feared he had been poisoned; for he has many enemies in the prison, who complain of ill-treatment." "And," said Tarleton, interposing, for he was Cunningham's friend, "it is the best guarantee of s Provost's fidelity, when he is hated by the enemy." "However," said Lord Howe, "prisoners cease to be enemies. Humanity, as well as their security, should then be considered by the Provost." p"Very true, amy Lord," said Tarleton; "but it remains to be proven that Captain Cunningham is deficient in so essential a quality as humanity." "The Doctor will prove it," said Montresor. "While I was administering the remedies," continued the Doctor, , I received a note written, to judge from the autogra- phy, by a female. It stated that if Captain Cunningham had dined on a pheasant, he had swallowed twenty grains of h tartar emetic. (Now I had just administered twenty grains myself.) She went on to say that a few days previously she had sent a young friend among the prisoners, a fine gosling, which did not reach its destination; and this pheasant had been drugged and sent in to ascertain who it was that intercepted her presents. Upon inquiry I learned the captain had been poaching--" Here he was interrupted by excessive laughter, in which the grave and serious Sir Henry Clinton could not avoid partici- pating. "Who was that glorious lady?" asked Cornwallis. "I can guess," said Sir Henry; "it could be no other than Miss Franks." "Your Excellency is in the right," said lontresor; "I have undoubted information in regard to it.";     I have "And I have it from Miss Franks, herself," said Major Andre, "that she will not only attend our grand celebration with the greatrst pleasure in the world, but use her best endeavours to have a full attendance of the beauty and fashion of the city pre sent on the occasion."   THE MONARCHST.          219 "She must be Queen of the Mezchianza," said Lord Cornwal- lis; "she merits that honour. See to it, Major, that we have plenty of fine ladies. Without them the whole affair will be a failure; and with them, we will have a lever by which we may move their rebel fathers, husbands, and brothers." "Never fear, my lord; with such accomplices and confederates as Miss Franks and Mrs. Ferguson, there can scarcely be a doubt of success. It is true some have objected to being present on an occasion complimentary to Sir William; but we will put it upon the ground of personal merit, and carry the day with music and banners." "One, I doubt not the Major can answer for without hesita. tion. I mean Miss Flora." The Major did hesitate a little, and blushed somewhat. "Oh, she is a royalist by profession, as her mother is." "But not so partial to the same pretender, eh, Major," added Lord Howe. "She was most partial to one who fell at the head of our column a few months since," said Andre. And the reference to Percy, produced for a moment a grave silence. "I hope, Colonel," said Andr6, "that you can answer for the presence of one fair lady yourself-the Miss Custis you are sometimes in the habit of accompanying to the theatre." "You are quite mistaken. No one can answer for her, save, perhaps, her rebel lover in Washington's army of fugitives. And yet she does not acknowledge herself to be disaffected to the royal cause." "Perhaps she is rather,' said Lord Howe, "ill-affected towards the gallant colonel." "In truth she seems to have no affection for me," said Tarleton. "Oh, did you know her lover was now in the city?" asked Andr6. "No, by Jupiter! Is he?" "Nay, don't play with the hilt of your sword. He is a pri- soner." "And as consummate a rebel," said Sir Henry Clinton, " as there is on the continent. He has refused to receive his liberty on condition of not serving against us again." "I will dispose of him, when exchanged," said Tarleton. "He was discovered at Germantown," said Montresor, c by  the gabbling of a gander, and he threw down his sword at its feet." "Of course, then, he will yield to me!" said Tarleton.     THE MONARCHIST. "Ie has a companion with him," said Sir Henry, "cone of the numerous Custis family, who would accept of his liberation on the easy terms proposed, if Waples would do so, but not without. But our petit girso, Ma+ster Robert Wales, has conceived a that is, to have him married." "In faith a most delectable species of bondage!" said Corn- wallis. "IHe has solicited the use of one of pur ships in the Chesa- peake, in which to confine the lady-love of the young gentleman, as well as the mistresses of other rebels. They are to be taken by a freebooting Captain Philips, who was once. acting under the authority of Lord Dunmore, but whose conduct 'has since been disavowed. The employment of Philips in the business is the osty impediment in the way of granting Master Robert's re- quest."; "I can obviate that, Sir arrry," said Lord Howe, "by order- icapg the oiv e rs of the sip to take exclusive charge of the fair captioes, and to deliver them to their proper owners, upon appli- cation in person, and the presentation of a certificate that they have pledged themselves not to serve again in the rebel army. "isnough; then Master Robert's request will be granted. lie is quite certain that when Custis learns his sweetheart is in captivity he will not be able to resist his inclination to  rescue on any terms."       on to     y to her At quite a late hour in the night the party sepaated. Corn- alis taking the ,arm of Andr6, they proceeded in the direction of the house of John Fields, the Quaker preacher, where Parson Badger, the jovial British chaplain had been billeted. Mr. Fields happening to have become more familiarly acquainted with his lordship, than with any of the other superior officers, had in that day made pplicatn to him to use his influence in procur- ing the removal of his guest, Parson Badger, to other quarters. His lordship had promised to call and see him that evening, for the purpose of entering into an examination of the conduct of the chaplain. His lordship, anticipating some amusement, pro- posed to Major Andr6 to accompany him p eThe  y entered they found, as they expected, the Quaker preacher and the Britsha chplain engaged in an animated dis- cussion, which was hardly suspended on their arrival. "Well, Chaplain, said his lordship, "I am apprehensive your lodgings here are not quite so agreeable to all the parties con- erned as might be desired."         p    c- "Your lordship will pardon m"e," said Badger, " for intimating   THE MONARCHST.          J. that perhaps your lordship is labouring under some misappre- hension. You will excuse me for saying that I never occupied more comfortable quarters in my life. I have my own wine, to- bacco, and cards, in my own room. I have a good bed, plenty of water, and sit down every day to the sumptuously furnished table of my good host." "Truly, you fare like a prince." "Oh, but I do! And who the devil could have reported the- contrary?" "Zebulon may inform thee, Charles, that he is satisfied with my house ; but I must be permitted to say that the house is not1 well satisfied with him. Zebulon, thee--" "Why the deuce don't you call me chaplain, parson, anything but the odious Zebulon. I never sign more than the Z, and have ever been vexed at my sponsors in baptism for bestowing *such a mawkish name upon me." "Charles," said friend Fields, "thee hears and sees for thy- self. I am shocked at his conversation, his practices, and his doctrines." "The devil you are!" exclaimed Badger; "and pray what do you find in them so objectionable?" "Friend Zebulon, thee should be ashamed of thyself to speak the word thee has just uttered! Does thee not know the impro. priety of such language?" "You allude to the appellation of his satanic majesty, I sup. pose. I call things by their proper names, Mr. Fields. He is so called in the bible and in my prayer book; and if I have cause to suspect him of obtruding here, and striving to foment antipathy, between us, I cannot feel disposed to designate him by any gentler name." "Since thee has named the bible, Zebulon, in this connexion, it seemeth to me that thee might be content to use the language of the master thee ought to serve, when he said simply,' get thee behind me, Satan.' But it was not for words alone, Charles, that I made my complaint to thee. His wine-bibbing, his cards, and his gallantries, are what I object to; and I cannot but deem them inconsistent with the profession he has adopted, demoralizing to the community, wounding to my household, and disgraceful to George, his master." "There, chaplain, what do you say in reply to these grave charges?" asked Andrd. "They are rather of grave importance, John," said Fields, who was intimate with Andr6, and admired his talents. "May it please ygur lordship," said Badger, to Cornwallis, 19*     222         THE MONARCHST. "I cannot suppose you to be ignorant of the fact, that in matters of doctrine and morals, I am only answerable to the bishops. My superiors in the army may see that the proper prayers are said by me, and that my sermons are orthodox and punctually delivered. But nevertheless I will defend myself gratuitously. I confess to drinking wine, in moderate quantities, because it is agreeable to my taste, and is good for the stomach. Christ's first miracle was the conversion of water into wine, to be drunk on a jovial occasion, and to promote hilarity. In regard to the cards, I confess likewise to a predilection for a social game at whist, when not otherwise employed. lIt is merely for amuse- ment. The cards are-very innocent bits of paper. My friend here, amuses himself sometimes, making calculations how much a hundred pounds will increase at compound interest in two hundred years. He proposes to invest that amount for some ob- ject, which, of course, he cannot live to see consummated, Ands these calculations he makes on Sundays; but I hope to convince him of the enormity of it, and to make a christian convert of him. Why should my little bits of paper which amuse me, be more heinous than those which afford him amusement? They maybe made of the same rags, for what he knows to the contrary, and at the same mill. As to my gallantries, your lordship knows I am not a married man, and that my elder brother, Lord is childless. If I survive him, it will be incumbent on me to furnish an heir for the title and estates." "My friend," said his lordship to Fields, "this is a delicate matter at issue between you; and I must not undertake. to decide it. But I trust it is merely a difference of opinion on subjects of morals and religion; and that a candid and dispassionate dis- cussion of them may result in your mutual benefit." "I grieve to hear thee say so, Charles; and it is a grievous thing that George, who is the usurping head of thy church should permit men to act in the capacity of chaplains who are devoid of piety. The church itself, has proven to be intolerant on many occasions; but I will not deny that it contains many good and pious men; men who worship God in the beauty of holiness; and I can only lament that all are not such. I can- not discuss anything with Zebulon dispassionately, as thee ad, vises; because he is too impassioned " 'The spirit moves me, when he denounces the church." The evil spirit moves thee, I fear, Zebulon." "It would have amounted to the same thing if you had said the devil." "Thee must not teach me propriety ot language, Zebulon.   THE MONARCHST.         2o3 Thee knows thee possesses a violent temper; and one of thy church, who, like thee, wore a crow-black gown, once fought a duel in Virginia, and wounded one of his own parishioners." "I never heard of that before," said Cornwallis. "It is true," said Andr6; "it was in the time of Charles II. But the minister was degraded afterwards." "Oh, but that makes no difference!" said Badger; "I am responsible for it; and if. any of you should unfortunately have a murderer or a thief in your corps, you must bear the blame, and be answerable to future generations for it. We are all sin- ners and reprobates in the estimation of friend Fields. Our rule of conduct and highest law should be the promptings of the spirit within, whether they be in accordance with parliamentary enact-- ments and church doctrines or not. We should not fight on the field of battle. In short we do nothing that is right, and leave nothing undone that is wrong." "Zebulon, thee is disposed to ridicule my society.' If we fol- low the promptings of an honest conscience, and invoke the guidance of a great and good God, we never violate any proper law or do injustice to any one. We will not engage in war, be- cause we feel convinced that it is wrong. But we provoke none to attack us, and make no assaults inconsistent with our profes- sions." "I cannot undertake to decide matters of this nature," said his lordship; {'yet I must say, friend John, that I feel a pro- found respect for your society, and the inoffensiveness and sim- plicity of its members. But it is late now; another time I will hear you again, and do what I can to accommodate you. Fare- well." His lordship and Major Andr6 withdrew, not quite satisfied with the diversion the scene had afforded them; and by no means pleased with the conduct of the chaplain, who was subsequently removed.     224         THE MONARCHST. CHAPTER XIX. Spiders conspire against the flies, Each silly victim gasps and dies; Then comes the sweep of fatal broom, Hurling the plotters to their doom. VILLAGE RHYMES. THE drooping spirits of the American patriots were revived by the brilliant success of General Gates in the north, which fol- lowed upon the heels of the crushing disasters attending the efforts of Washington in Delaware and Pennsylvania. Congress, assembled at Yorktown, was emboldened to persevere in the struggle for independence; and the Commander-in-chief, although he had gained no victories, had still preserved his army from disorganization, and had likewise inflicted severe blows upon the enemy in every engagement. He never despaired, under the most stunning misfortunes; and when almost perishing for the want of food and raiment, in the snow-enveloped tuts at Valley Forge, he was continually urging Congress towards the adoption of measures which would enable him to prolong the contest for an indefinite period, even in the event of continued reverses in the future. But other perplexities of a different nature were to be added to the Commander-in-chief's unpleasant burden of public cares and incessant duties. His enemies at Yorktown at this crisis redoubled their efforts to destroy him. Assembled in a chamber at one of the principal inns, in obedience to the appointment of the chief leaders of the conspiracy, their debates were of a most daring and interesting character. Their sentiments and objects were no longer concealed from the public; on the contrary many members of Congress were auditors on the present occasion, whose friendship and par- tiality for Washington had been repeatedly expressed both in public speeches and in private conversations. The time however had arrived for an eclaircissement; the project so long in pre- paration must be consummated now or never. Longer delay would be a virtual abandonment of the attempt.   THE MONARCHST.         225 "Gentlemen," said General Conway, "the success or failure of the cause of America, is involved in the events of the next few days. All who desire to see the independence of the country achieved, must contribute their utmost towards the elevation of a leader who is competent to the undertaking. In vain shall France herself throw her sword into our scale, if there be no competent Commander-in-chief to conduct the combined armies in the present emergency."' 6I consider it to be an utter impossibility for Washington to conduct the war hereafter, in all its complications, said Dr. ," in the event of France sending a fleet and an army to our assistance." "And that event is reduced to a certainty," said a member of Congress. "Such is the gratifying import of Dr. Franklin's let- ters, received by President Laurens." "The command of the combined armies," said General Mifflin, "should be conferred on one of some European experience." "At least it seems to me to be an indispensable necessity for the Commander-in-chief to be conversant with the French lan- guage," said Conway, who was known to be familiar with it. "Undoubtedly!" said Dr. --. "' A Commander-in-chief, on the field of battle, cannot always have an accomplished amanu- ensis ready at hand to translate his orders for the generals of the allies; nor an interpreter to make known to him reports from them requiring instant action." "And is Washington unable to translate the French without assistance?" asked a member of Congress. "Unfortunately it is so," said General Gates, who had main- tained a prudent reserve, supposing that, his recent triumph over Burgoyne, would speedily cause him to be-elevated to the chief command, upon the retirement of Washington. "And perhaps more unfortunate for himself, and for his fame," continued Gates, with an air of commiseration, "than hitherto for his country. You all know that I served on the Ohio, where I received a wound, which pains me still. It was there I learned that, pre- viously, when Colonel Washington was under-the necessity of capitulating to the French, he signed an article, containing an acknowledgment that he had assassinated Captain Jumonville, who had fallen in battle a few days previously. The French had sent Jumonville, with some fifty men, to attack Washington, if a prospect of success presented itself, at the point beyond the mountains, where the British colonists, were posted; if not, then merely to reconnoitre their position, and to amuse Colonel Wash- ington with pacific conferences until succours arrived. But     226         THE MONARCHST. Washington, being informed of the presence of the French, and not doubting their hostile intentions, although war was not really declared between the two nations, attacked them, and cap- tured most of the men. It was in this assault that Jumonville fell. The French, of course, branded it as a deliberate murder; and, subsequently, when their superior forces compelled Wash- ington to capitulate, the seventh article of the document signed by him contained this language: ' Que comme les Anglais out en leurpouvoir un officier, deux cadets, et gdndralement les pris qu'ils nous out faits dans L'ASSASSINAT du Sieur de Jumonville' &c. Captain Vanbraam explained to him that the words 'dans 'assassinat du Sieur de Jumonville,' merely meant that Jumon- ville had lost his life in battle, and he affixed his signature to the document, an official acknowledgment that he was an assassin. That document is preserved in the archives at Paris, and forms a portion of history, to the disgrace of England, by whose au- thority the Virginia Colonel was acting." "I saw it, and read it in Paris," said Master Robert Wales, whose ubiquitous person was to be found in every scene of important transactions. "But," he continued, with an arch- ness of expression he sometimes indulged, "since the great object seems to be to degrade England, methinks it eventually proved a good service on the part of Washington." "Not for his own reputation, Master Robert," said Conway. "Oh, but that don't appear to be a matter of much importance among us!" Master Robert," said Dr. --, "I should like to be resolved whether or not you are really co-operating with us in the great objects we have in view. You have access to all parties and to all camps, as a sort of universal negotiator. I am not at all dis- posed to doubt your ability,to serve any cause; I would merely wish to know which cause you are most disposed to serve." "I have no concealments, sir," said Wales; "I am perfectly candid in the declarations I make of my opinions and purposes; and nowhere more so than in this presence, where I frankly con- fess that I am a monarchist." "Under which King?" asked several. "No matter which," replied Wales; "but gather than see the exploded experiment of a republic tried in this country, I would prefer submission to the British crown. In the event of the establishment of independence, however, I shall advocate the putting of some one of the American chiefs-it might be one now present--on a throne." "How would Washington suit you?" asked Dr. ---   THE MONARCHST.          227 "He might answer, in default of a better." "And I have reason to know that a crown is his object," said Conway. "There you are in error," said Wales, " if his own declarations may be believed." "His declarations, I fancy," said Conway, " do not materially vary from those of other usurpers and tyrants under the same circumstances. But really, it must be admitted, that his recent operations might convince one that he is not making any rapid progress towards the attainment of his hopes, or the hopes of the country. His defeats in the field might be excused on account of inequality of numbers; but the loss of the forts on the Delaware, for the want of men to defend them, while he keeps ten thousand soldiers idle about his person, must ever be regarded by military men as an evidence of his incapacity to conduct a war, or else that it was the result of design." "There are many other things whispered about the country," said a member of Congress, which, if true (and I do not vouch for them), might lead one to suspect that Duch6's letter was sent to Congress merely to divert attention from his design to adopt the suggestion contained in it at some auspicious moment. There are those who think the projected enterprise against him at Whitemarsh, was not without a mutual understanding be- tween the commanders of the opposing armies. And although information was given by Mrs. Darrah of the design of the British, and it became necessary in consequence (for Mrs. D.'s intelligence was known to several American officers), to assume a posture of preparation to repulse the attack, I am credibly informed that Washington, when it became known that Howe had returned to the city, abandoning the enterprise, manifested much chagrin and disappointment. Perhaps if Sir William had skirmished a little, he might have put an end to the war, and we would have had none of these eternal complaints of privations and sufferings at Valley Forge." "In contrast to these-scenes of defeat and distress, ever attending the Commander-in-chief and the main army," said Dr. -   " we have only to view the result of the operations of a mere detachment, in another quarter, under the command of a competent general. I say it in his presence, it is true; but as I seek no military patronage, I may be exempted from the charge of interested motives, when I give it as my opinion that the general who conquered Burgoyne, would be the proper one to lead all our armies to victory hereafter!" This was followed by a' hum of applause throughout the room.     T HE MONARCHST. "Gentlemen," said General Gates, flushed with the compli- ment, "I am not at all ambitious to assume the very great responsibility you propose for me; and yet I thank you for the flattering estimate you have formed of my poor abilities. I am willing to serve my country in any honourable position which may be assigned me. But I must take the liberty of-saying that I do not consider a subordinate one under General Washing ton, in that light. He is utterly incompetent. I do not say so because I desire to succeed him. There are other men more capable than myself, perhaps, in this room (bowing towards Mifflin and Conway), of assuming the command. Under either of them, or the one who is greatest of all, it may be, but who is still suffered to remain unexchanged (General Lee), it would afford me pleasure to serve in a secondary capacity." "And now, gentlemen," said Conway, "we have talked enough. If anything is to be done) we must act, and that promptly. The question is, what shall be done, and how and when to begin?" All eyes were turned towards the fifteen or twenty members of Congress present, and particularly to the one who had mani- fested the most bitter hostility towards Washington. That mem- ber was the first to speak. "I am prepared to make the motion, gentlemen," said he, "provided I am seconded and sustained in a proper manner; but I must, first be certain that such will be the case. It seems to me, however, that charges should be preferred by some military character. It would be difticult to effect his removal without alleging something against his past conduct, which can be sus- tained by evidence. You will decide, gentlemen; for one I shall hold myself in readiness to abide the decision of the ma- jority." Various plans were proposed. But it was finally agreed that it would not be prudent to proceed with any great degree of harshness, as the moral impregnability of Washington's character was such that it would be idle to attempt to make him an object of odium in the popular mind. They well knew his extiemne sensibility of an implied censure, or an insinuated Want of confi- dence in his military capacity; and. it was determined to intro- duce a resolution calling for the appointim-t of a committee to investigate the causes of the failure to reinfrce the garrisons at forts Mifflin and Mercer sufficiently, and the reasons which pro- duced the repulse at Germantown, &c., &e. That day week was the time fixed upon for the introduction of the resolution, when it was reasonably supposed Washington   THE MONARCHST.         229 would immediately retire, at least temporarily, from the com- mand, and perhaps leave the army in disgust for ever, let the decision of Congress be what it might. In that case, who but the recent conqueror of Burgoyne could have been selected to fill his place? His praises were sounded everywhere on the conti- nent, and in Europe. Even Horace Walpole, who was the god- father of Gates, exulted over his victory, in one of his familiar letters to Sir Horace Mann. And it was owing to that fortu- nate event, in the otherwise apparently declining affairs of Ame- rica, that the French court, as stated by Dr. Franklin, had resolved to throw off the mask of neutrality. But the resolution was not destined to be introduced. Some of the disparaging remarks of Conway having been repeated to General Cadwalader, that officer, a zealous friend of Washington, challenged and wounded his antagonist, before the day arrived for the motion to be made in Congress. And the indignation of the majority in Congress, upon learning the existence and ex- tent of the conspiracy, added to the popular clamour in favour of the proposed victim, rendered it quite certain that the project, if pushed forward at that time, must inevitably fail of success. Subsequently the plot was revived; but it never assumed a for- midable aspect afterwards. 20     230         THE MONARCHST. CHAPTER XX. But meshes still are broken through, And pouting lovers may prove true; As faithful pilots blown afar Still gaze upon their guiding star. MASTER ROBERT'S plan had succeeded. Captain Philips, in obedience to his order, had contrived to seize Miss Luker, and several other young ladies, on the narrow peninsula of the eastern shore of Virginia. They were conveyed in a barge to the frigate Atalanta, Captain Poole, riding at anchor in the bay. This intelligence had been communicated to Custis by Captain Montresor, who again urged him to accept his release on parole, and this time he succeeded. Waples beseeched his friend to embrace the terms, and assured him that by so doing he would oblige him, instead of giving offence. Custis yielded, and has- tened to the south. His sister still determined to remain in the city, under the protection of the clergymen, until she might re- turn with safety to Virginia. Waples then set his wits to work. He was resolved to escape, if possible; and to fight through ano- ther campaign. He was fond of the excitement of war, as well as thoroughly convinced that any cause advocated by Washington must be just. But for more than a week he had racked his invention in vain. Every plan he formed seemed to be impracticable, without some confederate outside of the prison walls could be procured to as- sist him. Wales was away at the town of York; but he was not the one to render him any aid if present. He was in reality desirous that his daring young friend should remain securely where he was, unless he became willing to subscribe to the terms which had been offered him. Darrah and Kingsburgh had visited him daily. But friend Darrah turned very pale at the first mention of the word escape, and beseeched Waples, as a particular favour, if he really pos- sessed the means of escaping, to give him notice several days be- fore the one fixed upon for the attempt, so that he might discon- tinue his visits, and avoid even the suspicion of complicity in the act.  h'4:. g    THE MONARCHST.         231 Kingsburgh, unfortunately, coincided with Wales in the opinion that the terms which had been tendered the prisoner were liberal and generous, and ought to be unhesitatingly em- braced. He could not conscientiously aid an enemy to the cause he 'approved in escaping from a position in which he could do it no injury. As a desperate resort, poor Waples authorized friend Darrah to communicate the fact of his incarceration to Lydia, his wife-but to no other female whatever. Friend Darrah made no promises. He merely looked seriously wise, and discreetly said nothing. The next day, and the next after that, passed away without the eyes of the prisoner being cheered by the friendly visit of any one. lie now feared that Darrah, to prevent any of his family from being involved in the escape of a prisoner, had de- termined not to mention the circumstance of his captivity to any of them. Poor Waples, on the third day, experienced a depression of spirits, such as had never weighed him down before. Quakers and Quakeresses (as he called them) had come and gone repeat- edly with baskets of provisions and bundles of clothing for the suffering captives; but no Lydia had made her appearance in his apartment. -To check his rapidly increasing despondency, he sent for a bottle of rum, and drank rather copiously of its con- tents. This had hardly occurred, when the long looked-for Lydia (and it seemed an age to him) made her appearance, accompanied by an aged lady of the same persuasion. "Come in, Ann," said Lydia; "thee must be with me in my visit." At the name of Ann, Waples started up; but upon glancing at the grave dress and gray hairs that escaped from beneath the scoop-shaped bonnet of the stranger, he became composed. "Thee wonders why I have delayed coming, Samuel," said Lydia, advancing, and taking his proffered hand; " but my good husband has been so much engaged in the organization of a library society, that he forgot to mention thy situation to me until this morning." "I am glad to see you, Mrs. Darrah! And I hope you will prove a better friend to me in my need than your good husband was disposed to be. But we will talk about that presently. I see you have a basket," he continued, addressing Lydia's com- panion; " have you any wholesome food for a poor, half-famished mortal and sinner? Since I have been forsaken by my friends,     232         THE MONARCHST. that infernal heathen of a Provost has stinted my allowance in revenge for a justifiable trick I played him." "Samuel," said Lydia, reprovingly, "thee must not swear, if thee doesn't wish to drive thy friends away." "Forgive me, Lydia! I forgot I was in the presence of ladies. But that confounded-" "Stop! stop!" "I will. But I was about denouncing an enemy, and could wish it would drive him away." ' Is thee hungry?" asked Lydia's companion, taking from her basket several tempting slices of snowy, bread, heavily buttered. "As a shark!" said Waples, almost snatching at the food, and unable to forbear conveying a portion of it to his mouth. "But what has thee here, Samuel?" asked Lydia, taking up the bottle of rum. "My only friend, till you two angels came," said Waples; "you would not blame me, madam, if you could only have a conception of the lowness of my spirits this morning." "Thee should pray to be comforted by the good spirit within thee, Samuel." "I did. And since then I have felt as light as a feather in comparison." "Does thee eat many rats here?" asked Lydia's companion. "Rats? There isn't one of them left! My poor comrades who were taken with me, have become such good mousers, that there is no longer a single one left within the walls of the pri- , son." "But thee didn't eat any, surely?" "Me? no indeed! I couldn't get them! I offered two shillings a piece for them, but none came to my table. Oh, you have no idea what little value starving men place upon money. One poor famishing fellow refused a guinea for a fat tom-rat he had taken." "Is it possible! Oh, merciful parent, have pity on the poor captives!" said Lydia. Her companion sobbed audibly. Waples, seeing their sympathies sufficiently roused, thought it a good time to enlist them in his service. "Now ladies," said he, "since you commiserate my deplora- ble condition, will you not assist me to escape from this detest- able place?" "Ah, Samuel, I feared thee would come to that!" said Lydia. "My husband warned me to be on my guard against it. I can- not help thee in that way. I am already an object of suspicion;   THE MONARCHST.         233 and if the thing they charge me with were proved, they would surely hang me, as I am told." "Why, what the devil would they hang a woman for?" "Thee must not use such language, Samuel!" "I forgot. I beg your pardon. Won't you forgive me?" Samuel was made voluble by the rum. "Yea, Samuel, but do not forget again. I will tell thee what they charge me with. After thee was taken, William, the com- mander of George's army, and his officers, took possession of one of my chambers, to consult about the means of surprising George Washington, at Whitemarsh, where he was staying with his army. They came to my house to prevent even their own friends from knowing their intentions. When everything was arranged according to their wishes, they set off (the next night) wifh the whole army in full march. But instead of bringing back George Washington and his soldiers prisoners, they re- turned, dispirited and weary, without having been able to com- mit the violence they meditated. They found George Washington ready to receive them, and they suspect I gave him the intelli- gence. As thou art George's friend, and may be trusted," she added, in a whisper, "I will confess to thee that I did." Waples grasped both her hands between his. ' Lydia! God bless you!" cried he; "Lydia! one kiss-just let me kiss you once!" "What? Kiss me!" "Just once-if I die the moment after!" "But that is not allowable by married women, unless it be a holy kiss." "A holy kiss-a patriotic kiss-" "A what?" "A patriotic kiss-it will do Washington's heart good, when I tell him of it. Come!" Lydia was seized by the excited prisoner, who threw his arms round her, and kissed her repeatedly, while her aged companion attempted to interpose, and bestowed many blows upon the face of Waples, and with a most astonishing energy, too. "Upon my life, madam!" said Waples, turning to the ancient companion of Mrs. Darrah, "it seems to me you can be no true Quaker. The non-combativeness of your sect must at least be violated in such an assault." "Self-defence is the first law of nature, thou knowest." "I did not attack you."     I "No; but thee assailed my companion. I forgive thee." "Thank you! And my face can bear witness that your 20*     234         THE MONARCHST. friendship is more to be desired than your enmity. But now, Lydia, since you have served the cause, why not serve me?" "I have told thee why. Thee may be sure I am an object of suspicion, already. I can do nothing for thee. Why not appeal to Ann?" "I will get down on my knees to her, if she will serve me!" "I could cheerfully risk something to do thee service," said Ann; " but if thee were to escape, would thee not hasten to the army and draw thy sword again?" "I am pledged to see Washington once more before I go back to Virginia." "Then, peradventure thee had better remain where thee will be safe from the bullets of the enemy. It would be a grievous wound upon my hea-  conscience-to be instrumental in thy liberation, and then to learn that thee had fallen in battle. Thou art safe, now!" "No, by Jupiter! I shall die of consumption. The explosion of the Augusta, as you may see, broke all' the glass in the win- dows, and I shall have a cough that will be the death of me. The blasted old savage-Cunningham-will not let the glazier repair the damage, even at my expense. He says ventilation is necessary; and I confess the frosty wind has had one good effect." "And what may that be?" "It has destroyed the fleas and other vermin." "And they troubled thee in this room?" "Troubled me! If you had visited me before the last cold spell, you would not have asked the question. They were particu- larly troublesome to the women, because, I suppose, they never wear leather breeches." "Leather breeches!" iterated Ann. And that brings me to the point. The only service I would beg of you is merely to bring me friend Darrah's drab breeches, brown shad-bellied coat, and broad-brimmed hat. lie must come, too, however; you will have only to leave the basket containing them in this room, while you spend some fifteen minutes com- forting the other prisoners. That is all." "All!" exclaimed Mrs. Darrah. "Thee would wear my husband's clothes, and leave him a prisoner in thy stead!" "Oh, but I would do no such thing! He is not suspected. If they make him responsible (and he is to know nothing of the matter), I pledge my honour to come back again; and I will wait in the orchard, on the north side of High street, until this   THE MONARCHST.         235 good old lady shall come to me with the news that friend Darrah has returned in safety to his home." "Thee is good at plotting, Samuel," said Ann; "and I should be tempted to aid thee, as an act of charity, if I did not fear thee would soon be spilling the blood of thy enemies, or perhaps having thine own shed. Why is thee not content to remain out of danger?" "And -leave my comrades and my country to be destroyed? You would not be so cruel, I hope." "Thy comrades and country are doing very well, so far as the British are concerned. Has thee not heard that General Bur- goyne-" "John, Ann!" said Mrs. Darrah. "True. Has thee not heard that John Burgoyne, and all his army, have been captured in the north?" "No! Lignum vite!-" "What's that, Samuel?" "A new substitute for an oath-I will not swear again, if I can help it! But, tell me! Is that true?" "It is." "I might have known it! The prisoners had another whip- ping; the Provost has them whipped every time the British are beaten. But, now-gloria in excelsis!-- "Is that another substitute, Samuel?" "Hardly; I found it in the prayer-book. But common language cannot express my joy! Come! let me kiss you, too!" said he, seizing the hand of Lydia's friend, which was really so fair and plump that he kissed it, unconsciously. "Thee must not be rude!" said Ann. "Rude? I'll do it as gently as a baby! Come, now!" and he did kiss her. "Thee is a daring man, Samuel!" said she. "And a good patriot! I have kissed both of you for Wash- ington; and I will tell him of it to-morrow!" ' To-morrow?" "To be sure. Have you not consented to bring the basket and friend Darrah to-day at one o'clock precisely? To stay fifteen minutes in the other wards, and then meet me in the High street orchard, between Fifth and Sixth streets? Oh, I forgot! I may not be able to return friend Darralh's clothes. Here are five guineas. They will indemnify him. I suppose Cunningham will wear mine." "Impossible!" said Ann. "Had thee not better put thine in the same basket, and carry it along with thee?"     236         THE MONARCHST. "Oh, by all means! Thank you for the idea. If it would not offend you I would beg to be permitted to kiss you again- both of you." "Thee must not do it. Farewell." And the ladies retired, their consent being won by a coup de main. Precisely at the time appointed, Ann and friend Darrah made their appearance, and passed on, after setting down the basket in Waples's room, to the distant wards. Waples was soon clad in the Quaker costume. By a small fractured mirror hung up-near the window, he surveyed himself with unmingled satisfaction. The clothes fitted him exactly; and he felt confident of the success of his plan. Then, pulling the hat well down over his face, and placing the basket containing his own clothes on his arm, he boldly sallied forth, and passed the sentinels in the hall without being questioned. But when he was about to emerge from the great entrance he encountered Cunningham himself, who was conversing with Gal- loway! "Thee makes a short visit to-day, William," said Galloway; "but where is thy companion?" Waples, fearing to trust his voice, which was quite a different one from the whining sound of the schoolmaster, merely made gestures endeavouring to signify that she would follow soon, and that he was in very great haste. ^ Thee should not leave her behind among the wicked rebel prisoners." Waples shook his head; and then nodded acquiescence, and passed on. He passed the last sentinels and was in the street! The snow greeted his eyes for the first time; and the fresh breeze seemed to add vigour and elasticity to his step. Without looking to the right or the left, but merely nodding or shaking his head in reply to the remarks addressed to him by several of the acquaint- ances of Darrah whom he encountered, he never paused until he had reached the most obscure spot to be found in the orchard. He then took a brace of pistols from the basket and concealed them on his person, resolved not to be recaptured without a struggle. But when he looked back, under the snow-laden branches of the apple trees, and beheld no one observing him, much less in pursuit, he drew, for the first time, the long, deep breath of freedom! More than punctual to the time appointed, Ann was seen ap- proaching before the expiration of the fifteen minutes which had been named by him.   THE MONARCHST.         237 "Thee is now free!" said she, striding with difficulty through the hitherto untrodden snow, and approaching Waples. "I give thanks to thee and God for it." "Nay, yormshould thank God first." "As you will; but I am bound to you for life; to him for eternity." Thee uses strong language." "I feel strong, now! A strong man has bold ideas and uses vigorous language." "Fare thee well, then; thee has no time to linger. Friend Darrah passed out safely. But the Provost and a friend with him, turned pale; they said they had seen him pass a few minutes before in a vision, and had even accosted him. At last they supposed it must have been some other friend. But why dost thou linger? Farewell!" "Wait a moment," said Waples, in deep reflection. "Do you know Miss Custis, the companion of Miss Kingsburgh, now boarding with Lydia?" "Yea, verily." "I must contrive to see her before I leave the city, provided she has not been made acquainted with my captivity, as I desired." "Thee might run too great a risk of being taken again. No; thee must depart, now.' I will deliver any message thee desires. "I want her to accompany her brother to Virginia--- " "Thee must know it is too late. Thy friend Thomas has al- ready departed. He wished her to go with him; but she would not."' "Then I must see her. No one will know me in this disguise."  "But thee can't disguise thy voice." "True; and Ann would not know me; perhaps she would not see me. Once I borrowed these garments, after the battle of Brandywine, and met her in the hall. She did not know me; and in truth, when I resumed my own clothes, she seemed to be indifferent about recognising me. It was on the night young Percy was buried. How beautiful she looked then, all in white; just as I would behold her at my wedding. Now she may sup- pose I am indifferent, and even forget me, or see some one else who will please her better. I will see her, at all hazards, for it may be the last time!" "Does thee care so much for her?" "I do. I would die for her. And if I live to see Washington again, I will ask permission to return to Virginia, and do my fighting in my own country. He will grant my request. Then it is my design to have her mother write a peremptory order to     238         THE MONARCHST. Mr. MacCoskie to bring her home. Then-but it is idle to talk thus. I must see her! Will you not prepare her?" "You cannot see her at her boarding-house. It is filled with British officers. You can only meet her here, and that under a pledge that you will not so much as take her hand, for fear of being observed. You must keep up your character, you know, until you are out of danger." "You, you, you! You forget yours! Why-it is! It is! by St. Cupid and his bow! Ann! Ann!" "Not another inch! Approach me not, as you value your liberty!" said Miss Custis, whose gray wig had been sufficiently removed for her lover to discover the dark silken tresses con- cealed beneath. "You take my breath!" said Waples, panting; ' and to you I am indebted for liberty, perhaps for life! Now, I am yours  Dispose of me as you see fit!" "Then hasten away immediately. See Washington, and ob- tain permission to go home. I will not say you shall not de- fend your native state if it is to be the scene of war, as I fear it will be, from what I have heard Tarleton say; but I am tired of the city. I cannot bear the idea of so much luxury and extrava- gance here, while Washington, I am told, and his brave army, are almost perishing in the snow at Valley Forge!" kisOh, Ann how truly I love you now! At least a patriotic kiss--" "No! upon the pain of my displeasure, no! Approach me not. Rather fly!" I'm a dead man, then. My heart is left behind me!" said Waples, retiring slowly. "A parting shake of the hand will not attract notice," said Ann, following. "But," she continued, when he grasped her hand, "don't crush it so! Farewell! and may-" "God bless you!" added Waples, departing abruptly, and not venturing to cast another glance behind. He pursued a north-easterly direction, which brought him to the barrier up Front street, where John Roberts and Abram Carlisle, Quaker tories, were to examine all persons passing and repassing, and to grant permits to any whom they knew to be well affected to the British cause. Waples turned neither to one side nor the other, but kept right on between the soldiers on guard. "Stop, friend Darrah!" cried Carlisle and Roberts, stepping out of the little house to the right of the gate. "We want to" ask thee about the news from England."   THE MONARCHST.         239 Waples paused not, but beckoned them to overtake him. He was in a very great hurry. The soldiers seemed to be disposed ;   t% challenge him, but forbore in consideration of his garb, and the familiarity with which he had been accosted by the tories. Roberts and Carlisle persisted in the desire of holding some conversation with him, and stepped briskly through the gate in pursuit of him, and in obedience to his beckoning gestures. They presumed friend Darrah had something to say, which should be, perhaps, spoken out of ear-shot of the soldiers. "Thee is in a most extraordinary hurry!" they exclaimed, following Waples, who still continued to keep them in the rear, until they had proceeded more than a hundred paces beyond the barricade, and turned an angle in the road which concealed them from the view of the guard. And all the time they were beckoned on, in a most mysterious manner, by their supposed friend Dar- rah, who occasionally uttered a "whis-t!" to impress them the more with the importance of the subject which so mysteriously moved him, and-to gain time and distance. "Thee must go slower, William," said Carlisle, panting, "or we cannot overtake thee. Why does thee wish to get so far?" "Whist!" was the reply. "Thee must be moved by something very remarkable indeed!" said Roberts. At length, and just when the dusk of evening began to ob- scure distant objects, Waples slackened his pace, and permitted, his pursuers to come up with him. "Now what is it thee has to say?" asked friend Roberts. "What is it thee wishes to know?" was the whining response of Waples. ' That is not like William's voice," said friend Roberts. "Thee is almost out of breath, friend Darrah," said friend Carlisle. "Rest thyself." "You had better return--both of you," said Waples. "Take my advice and return. Upon reflection, I have concluded to tell you nothing." That is not friend Darrah's voice!" said Carlisle. "Must thee concern thyself about other people's voices?" "Yea, verily, and their persons too," raid the tories, endeav- ouring, at the same time to lay hold of their supposed prisoner, deserter, or spy, in disguise. "Will you attempt to do violence to my person?" asked Waples, casting them off gently. "Thee must return with us and' show thy papers; else how can we know thee is not an enemy to George, in disguise?"     240        THE MONARCHST. "Must you know that I am not an enemy in disguise?" "Yea!" "Then you shall. I will not disguise it. Do you take thatr- and that!" And as he uttered the last words, he knocked them both down; and before they recovered sufficiently to give the alarm, Waples was out of danger, pursuing his way to Valley Forge, through intricate paths, or over frost-crusted marshes, where horsemen durst not pursue. Upon reaching a solid plain, he fell in with one of Captain McLane's famous troopers, who took him up behind him on his horse, and relieved his wearied limbs, for he soon ascertained that his long inactivity had ren- dered him incapable of making a prolonged march, on foot, with- out extreme pain and exhaustion. \   THE MONARCHST.         '241 CHAPTER XX,. Snow-beaten huts may shield the great, As well as gilded palace hall; Wisdom and virtue prop a state, When battlements and towers fall. WHLE the British officers in the city were making prepara- tions for magnificent, displays and extravagant festivities in honour of their late Commander-in-chief, who was soon to sail for merry England, the scene in the American camp was of quite a contrary description. The rude huts afforded a very inade- quate shelter to the half-clad and half-fed soldiers., Even the officers themselves were not lodged beyond the reach of the drifting snow. The poor sentinels, enveloped in blankets, quilts, and skins, more or less in a dilapidated condition, resembled uncouth monsters, more than men, as they went their dismal rounds. Washington's house, temporarily erected, like the rest, was not much superior in dimensions and conveniences to the com- mon log cabin inhabited by the poorest of our western squatters. It was a bitter night; cold, with a fine drifting snow, which found access to the General's chamber in spite of all the pre- cautions that had been adopted to guard against it. Washington, walking to and fro between the door and the wide fire-place, was dictating a letter to Colonel Hamilton, who sat upon a split- bottomed chair beside an unvarnished pine table. "That will do, Colonel," said he, when the letter was come pleted. "It is now my hour for retiring to rest. Yet I feel no inclination to sleep. What a night!" he continued, opening the door a few inches, and closing it quickly again, as the snow assailed his face and bosom. "Ah, General!" said Colonel Hamilton, "your old aid, Colonel Reed, on such a night as this, is compensated for his many pri- vations and sufferings. For more than a year he was in despair; but his letter received yesterday, shows that he is now in the enjoyment of perfect happiness." "True; and we may be likewise compensated in the end, at 21     242         THE MONARCHST. our happy homes, by the smiles of our families. I am glad the Colonel has found his charming lady at last. May the meeting of all of us with our wives be as blissful!" "Amen!" said Hamilton. The youthful colonel as yet had no wife. "And yet methinks there should be other rewards for those who toil and suffer as we do, besides the domestic comforts of our peaceful homes." "And there will be for those who desire them," said Wash- ington, with a sigh; " but for my part, if I know my own wishes, I am sure I could be content, this contest once gloriously ended, to spend the rest of my days in peaceful retirement at Mount Vernon." "Once ended so, you might afford to do it," said young Hamil- ton; "for the country, nay the world, would be filled with your fame. But a vast number of others would not be content to follow your example. Still, General, you may rely upon it, you will not be suffered to achieve the independence of your country, and then repose on your laurels in retirement. After the sword shall be sheathed, then will commence your civil career. The government is to be re-organized, and you must be its head and chief. Nay, you may shake your head, but you will not be able to shake the inevitable will of the people. Your life is no longer your own. It belongs to your country. You cannot escape the sacrifice." "They will give me an honourable discharge, if I merit it, and ask it. But what is the meaning of that?" asked Washington, pausing, as he heard the challenge of the guard. "I trust it is no surprise on such a night as this!", said Hamilton. "There is no probability of that. The King's officers are too fond of luxurious living and comfortable quarters, to seek us here." The next moment the door opened, and Master Robert Wales appeared, his voluminous wrappings completely covered with snow. "What is it?" asked Hamilton, rising up and gazing at the diminutive intruder. "A man, sir!" said Wales, throwing off his outer garments; and after saluting the Chief respectfully, he approached the fire. "Ay, every inch a man!" said Hamilton, smiling. "And if there were more inches," said Wales, ' there would be a greater surface for this inclement weather to prey upon, and my sufferings would be only increased by it." "Master Robert, whence come you?" asked Washington,   [; iTHE MONARCIIST.                243 after a pause, and when his visiter had expelled the numbness from his hands. "From York, sir." "Indeed! I hoped to hear something from Philadelphia." "And you shall, sir. My correspondents in the city keep me well advised. In the first place, they intend to give Sir William a splendid entertainment before he sails for England. Such are the rewards of those who fight for princes." "And yet, if we may believe some of the reports we hear, Sir William will not be likely to have a very cordial reception on his return." "It may be so. His laurels have been somewhat scattered' to the winds by the events in the north. And yet a company of foot in the city brings 2200, and the command of a troop of dragoons sold for 4000 guineas. This, I believe, while even your colonels are resigning." "True, true; too true! Hamilton, can you conceive why Congress still hesitates to adopt the plan of providing pay, or half-pay for life, which I have so repeatedly urged?" "Yes, sir, very easily. It is because there are designing men among them, who can never hope to rise to the eminences they aim at, unless the army be utterly disbanded at the end of the war. They are startled at the idea of X pension list, or the establishment of anything else endued with sufficient stability to withstand the assaults of popular clamour." "I think it must be so, sir; I have long feared it," said Washington. "And, with the rest of their views, I believe I would not err, if I said their designs not only comprehended objects specially to benefit themselves, but likewise the means of clipping Samson's hair, when the period shall arrive for- the sword to be laid aside- and if possible before that joyful time." "Not so, not so, surely." "Pardon me, if I say it is so beyond a doubt," said Wales; "and it would be no difficult matter to designate the influential individuals who thwart your desires. However, as I shall soon leave the speculators and intriguers to work out their own salvation, it would not become me, in parting, to throw a brand of discord behind." "And whither do you propose going?". "To Virginia, as the amanuensis of Mr. Jefferson, to learn republicanism, the danger of standing armies,' the aristocratic tendency of pensions, and the wretchedness of monarchies." "And so you have become disgusted with political speculation     L a1 IuUiNAJUHST. C and intrigue at the seat of war?" said Washington, smiling.  1 "You will find it a hopeless undertaking, Master Robert, to at- tempt the conversion of that man, and another you will probably meet with."                      y "Patrick Henry. By hook or by crook, I must have them both; or else the country will some day experience a worse tyranny in the despotic rule of committees and conventions, than it has hitherto felt i the arbitraray cnduct of his Majesty's ministers." "You s'eem to argue from the basis of an ultimate independ, ence 1" said Washington. "Yes, sir; if a few such men as I have named be not con- verted, or conciliated. The northern states are already aban- doned. You will not be likely to have any more battles north of New York. Even Philadelphia and the Delaware are to be evacuated It is so ordered by the ministry, unless some un- foreseen auspicious event shall soon transpire to obviate the ne- cessity." "This is a new order of things 1" said Washington. "Hence my presence here. As you have done hitherto,' so you may now, place implicit reliance on my information. And f there could be some guarantee that the rule of George III., n the states, was to be succeeded by a stable monarchy, you night henceforth, perhaps, find in 'your humble servant not a :ontemptible coadjutor." "There can be no guarantee of that." "Certainly not, except by the silencing of such democrats as have named. In short, although it is not to be presumed that he pride of England will readily submit to the interference of ;s ancient enemy, yet no one capable of taking a comprehensive iew of the sentiments and means of the people of America, can Lil to perceive what the result must be. In short, France, so mng undetermined and vacillating, has at last resolved to throw or weight into the scale; and Lord North, seeing no prospect ultimate success in the north, has conceived the idea of con- rotrating his forces in the south. Some of the col nies may subjugated and detached from the rest. They will now act )on the old adage that half a loaf is better than no bread. nything else than their miserable policy might have secured e whole." "True enough, Master Robert," said Washington. "If what stated in relation to the nature of the instructions of the new wmissioners be true, and the terms they are now prepared to   offer had been tendered two years ago, we would have embraced them. It is too late, now." "Mr. Jefferson's correspondents at the court of Versailles have kept him advised of the determination there, and he now retires to another field to sow the seeds of republicanism. He wants my services, and he shall have them. He is quite confi- dent of making a convert of me; or at least of circumscribing my ideas. Mark our progress. You will hear of his move- ments."  "For one, Master Robert," said Hamilton, "I shall wish you success. If, your Excellency, I can at all penetrate the future, it seems to me that ambitious men, anticipating the result of the war, are already hastening to lay the foundations of structures upon which they can ascend to eminence and power hereafter. The moment peace smiles upon the land, the sword will lose its influence. Words, written or spoken, will then direct the capri- cious millions; and the most deserving may be hurled to the bottom of the troubled waters. Your glory cannot be obliterated; but it may be dimmed by misrepresentation. The recent attempt at York, is an evidence that there will not be wanting a disposi- tion to undermine even you, and to raise up men deficient in the great essentials of truth and morality." "My dear friend, when the country has peace and independ- ence, the sooner I am dismissed to the happy shades of Mount Vernon, the better for me. It is what I desire." "But there can be no peace without you. Internal dissensions will succeed to war, and the vitals of the country be torn by its own ambitious children." "They look beyond the life of the only one who can check their restless pursuits," said Wales. "To him the country would accord everything; and they will not openly enter into an oppo- sition. Him once disposed of, then the bone will be fairly ex- posed for contention. Hence their advocacy of a republic, which is to change its head and its policy at regular periods. The one who can frame the most perfect organization of partisans, or who shall happen, whether accidentally or not, to be the minion of these organizations, whatever may be his merit, will, of course, ascend to the pinnacle of power. The constant succession of such ascensions, will afford hope to all aspirants. But aspirants are not always the most meritorious, or the best qualified to con- duct the government of a mighty nation. They are the most clamorous, and will ultimately thrust back all the best men. And when a few generations of patriots and statesmen are thrust aside, by the intrigues of party, and the caprices of the multitude, 21*     246        .THE MONARCHST. what will be the result? Is that a just principle which proscribes the great and the good, and elevates only the obscure or profligate in a state? When such is the case, as it has been, and will be in republics, must not the failure of the experiment be admitted? What then? Why, strife between the good and the bad, the wise and the ignorant! The greatest number will win the victory. One need not doubt on which side the greatest number will be found. Then the voice of the mob becomes the law; and the law will change with every wind. The favourites of the moment will be tyrants, and the multitude, by whose authority they will act, will be devoid of conscience and responsibility. Thus, instead of a sole monarch, moved by every consideration of interest to transmit to his posterity unimpaired the diadem of a happy and prosperous nation, there will be a multitude of despots, ever de- vising means to secure the greatest amount of spoils in the briefest space of time." "What a picture!" exclaimed Washington. "And yet, under the existingconfederation," said Hamilton, it is apparent that nothing but the common appreciation of public danger, lends a shadow of authority or consistency to the acts of Congress!" "That must be admitted!" said Washington, with energy. "The states obey or not, as it suits their convenience. It could be wished that there was a means of compelling acquiescence in the resolutions of Congress. They have ordered the states to fur- nish their contingents by the end of the year. Thirty thousand recruits should be present to-day; whereas not three hundred have arrived! The present union is no more than a wisp of straw or a rope of sand. But let us first achieve our independ- ence, before we despair of erecting a better government. Suffi- cient for the day is the evil thereof." "True, your Excellency," said Wales; "and the evils are not confined to one side only. There are incompetent men, it must be admitted, likewise, in high places, under kings. But they can be changed without affecting the tenure of the chief executive. The plan of bribing American statesmen and generals, was a silly expedient, as I foretold. But they are not yet convinced, it seems." "To what do you allude? What generals have they attempted to. bribe," asked Washington. "I may not name them; indeed I may not know their names. This I know; there is a large sum in the military chest destined to that service; and it will only serve the cause the ministry would injure. Offers have been made; I can only say that one   THE MONARCHST.         247 of your generals, whom you have befriended and protected on several occasions, is now in correspondence with Sir Henry Clinton." "Negotiating without the authority of Congress," said Hamil- ton, smiling, " as Duche proposed to your Excellency." ' It may be so," said Washington; " but a traitor in the camp, when exposed, instead of injuring the cause would aid it; it would be equivalent to a victory. Nothing could rouse the pub- lic sentiment in our behalf more effectually. So, Master Robert, there may be some virtue in a republic after all; since the ex- pression of an indignant public opinion never fails to send large accessions to the army." "Oh, in war I admit it. It was so in the days of the Com- monwealth. Republics, in war, must ever be formidable. Public opinion will fill the ranks, and demagogues will fight, and may serve to be killed as well as better men. But war itself is an evil, and hence their expertness at it, and proclivity for it." Just then Waples entered, clad in his own garments. Wash- ington stared a moment in surprise, and then embraced him. "Welcome, my brave boy!" he said, with hearty warmth. "Welcome back to the camp! How did you obtain your re- lease?" "I took it," replied Waples, smiling, and returning the salu- tations of Hamilton and Wales. "Do you mean to say you embraced the terms offered by your captors?" "By no means, General. I refused them from the begin- ning." "Enough! you are then restored to the army, free to fight again  That is enough. I will not ask to be informed of the particulars of your escape." "But pardon me if I do," said Wales; "because I find my- self outwitted. I intended you should remain in the comfortable quarters provided for you, to keep you out of harm's way." "Or from doing harm," said Waples. "If it suits you better. But I charged the guard to keep a particular watch over you." "Thank you!" said Waples. "There must have been a woman in the plot," said Wales. "Master Bob," said Waples, seriously, " there was a woman in it; nay, two. You, no doubt have already conjectured who they were. Now, whether your conjecture be right or wrong, makes no difference to me; I merely desire to know whether     248        THE MONARCHST. they are likely to be made the objects of your vengeance for the part they have acted." "By no means. That would not restore you to your cell. I applaud them, while I regret that you are at liberty." "Whatever else may be said of you, Master Bob-and they do say very much which I can't comprehend-it cannot be charged that you are false to your word; and now I will relate the man- ner of my escape." The party seemed to be amused with his narration, and Wash- ington readily granted his request to return to Virginia, with a pledge, on the part of Waples, to enter the field whenever the scene of conflict might be transferred to his own country. Then Master Robert took his leave, with the intention of riding to Philadelphia that night, where, on the day following, or as soon after as possible, he promised Waples to make arrangements for the safe conduct of Ann to Virginia; and it might be that he would accompany her thither himself.

THe rising of the sun was hailed by the discharge of guns on board the ships in the harbour. The vessels had their flags jauntily displayed, and gay streamers floated out from every mast and yard-arm. The morning was bright and beautiful, and spirit-stirring music and joyous laughter floated upon the gentle breeze. It was the day appointed for the grand meschianza. It began with a fine regatta of barges, handsomely decorated, and contain- ing, besides the rowers, most of the beautiful women of the city. In vain had it been attempted to prevent the daughters of patriots and of officers in the American army, from witnessing the exhi- bitions, and partaking of the entertainments in honour of the late British Commander-in-chief. Very many of them could not and did not resist the temptation to be present on that joyful occa- sion. None of them, however, it may be presumed, were in- duced to abandon the cause of their country for the sake of merely witnessing a show. Nevertheless there were but few- and the ladies especially-who could resist the desire,of gratify- ing a very natural curiosity. At all events, it is undeniable that great numbers of the beauty and fashion both of the city and its neighbourhood were present in their handsomest attire. The barges started from the Northern Liberties, and swept along the entire front of the city down to the old Swedes' church, where they landed, and the company was conducted from thence to the magnificent pavilion erected at Wharton's country seat in Southwark. There was a procession to the pavilion, consisting of thousands of soldiers, in gay habiliments, bearing splendid banners, and attended by many bands of accomplished musicians, whose inspiring notes seemed to impart convivial inclinations to- every hearer. When the immense cortege arrived, the pavilion was thrown,     250         THE MONARCHST. open, and seven beautiful young ladies, in Turkish costume, were discovered seated on the front seat. A herald (Mr. Beaumont) proclaimed the challenge in the name of the Knights of the blended rose. Seven White Knights, on gray chargers, appeared, and encountered an equal number called the Knights of the Burning Mountain, with spears, swords, and pistols-in sham fight. Such amusements continued for more than an hour. They were planned by Captain Montresor; and the managers were Sir John Wrotlesby, Colonel O'Harra, Major Gardiner, and Captain Montresor. Black slaves in tinselled robes and turbans next appeared, and drawing aside a curtain, preceded the company to the rich ban- quet which had been prepared for them. The festivities of the day were succeeded by a grand ball. It was on that occasion that Sir Henry Clinton received the cele- brated rebuke from Miss Franks, whom he led upon the scene to be his partner in the dance. "Musicians," cried he, "give us 'Britons, strike home."' In the confusion, he had not been heard, or distinctly understood, and a pause ensued. le repeated the order; but before he could be obeyed, lMiss Franks turned to the band, and said aloud: "His Excellency, the Commander- in-chief, has made a slight mistake--he should have said 'Britons, go home!"' Late in the night Major Andre, who had not been sogay as usual during the day, conducted Flora to her lodgings, and seemed disposed to linger in her presence. They were- alone in the dimly lighted parlour. The clergymen, Hewitt and Mac Coskie, had returned with Ann and Wales to Virginia, and the Kingsburghs were now the sole remaining guests. "Flora," said Andr6, retaining the hand which had been ex- tended upon his rising, as she supposed, to depart, " this is the hour I have appointed to declare--" "For heaven's sake," said she, gently withdrawing her hand, "make no declarations! Our purposes are nothing. The present is all we have. Oh, the present! That scene is: present to me now! It was here they laid him, cold and still in death! He declared he loved me. And I am spre he did. But he declared he would be mine! And was he not? Ay, all that remained of him. We placed him gently in the cold, cold grave!". "Flora-" "No; I implore you, no. Do not utter it. I loved him.; and you resemble him--" "Flora!" "Do not speak, I beseech you! Would you, too, be loved   THE MONARCHST.         251 and mourned?  Oh, fly! and think no more of me, for ever! I saw him fall in a vision-before the battle-and learned that there was no happiness for me. And I have had another vision--- Flora! if I was the subject of it, be my fate what it may, I shall be happy." Happy! It was too indistinct to be described. But it was a picture which left a cold spot in my heart ' Yes, you resemble him, and I will not deny my-I will not say affection-but friendship for you. If it be more, it is death! "Fear not, Flora!" "Fear no; let me not fear it. Depart. Leave this fatal country. In another land there is one who will bless your return. If you return not, she will die broken-hearted." "There was one, it is true, Flora, who captivated my youth- ful fancy. But that is past. There was no deep affection, such as I feel for you!" "As deep-as the grave, where you must lie! Farewell, fare- well! We may be friends-let us be only friends. I will watch over you-will pray for you-but oh! let me not bury you!" And thus they parted, Andr6 confident of ultimate success, although gravely affected by her words.     252         THE MONARCHST. CHAPTER XXIII. The eternal ocean murmurs Over its pearly mines; And the gentle winds are sighing Through the ever moaning pines. IT was about noon. The sky was lightly overcast with dappled clouds, which remained unbroken and stationary. A recent storm had seemed to exhaust the fury of the elements. Scarcely the slightest breeze was now perceptible; but the rolling surf on the seashore, some six miles distant, was distinctly heard as far as the head of the creeks on the bay side of the peninsula. Squire West was sitting quite alone in his parlour, with all the doors and windows open, for there was a sultry atmosphere. 1His daughters, and son-in-law, had gone down the creek on a visit to Miss Luker, who had happily been restored by Captain Poole of the Atalanta. Thomas Custis upon his arrival had gone to the ship with a flag, and had been treated with the utmost kindness, somewhat to his astonishment. But for many days he could nowhere meet with Captain Philips, or any of his barges. The act of the bucaneering captain was not approved, as he learned from Captain Poole, by the British officers. Nor had Philips any authority from .their government to commit acts of aggression on the peaceful inhabitants of the eastern shore of Virginia. And inferring from this that he might wage a war against the freebooters without violating his parole, young Custis and others had armted and manned the barge Victory, in Acco- mac county, for the purpose of taking the captain. On the day the old Squire is again introduced upon the scene, it was reported that Philips, with several of his barges, had been seen in the bay. For many minutes the Squire continued motionless, with his eyes turned in the direction of the bay, although, of course, it was quite hidden from view by the intervening groves. His left foot reposed on a pillow, bandaged and swollen. He was recover- ing slowly from a recent attack of his old remedy, as he called the gout. That day he had been more querulous than usual,   THE MONARCHST.         253 not from pain, but in consequence of his inability to visit the "Victory," which was to receive its crew of volunteers, and sally out that morning on its first cruise. In common with the inhabitants generally, he had taken a deep interest in the pre- parations made for the destruction of the piratical barges of the notorious Captain Philips. "There! they are at it!" he exclaimed, his hands thrust foi- ward, and his eyes dilated with the interest he felt in the issue, as he listened to the booming of the distant guns. "Samson!" he continued, calling for his ancient coachman, without averting his eyes from the direction of the reports, still heard, and at shorter intervals, although as effectually obscured from his vision as if a continent had intercepted the view. "The piratical thief! the prowling kidnapper! Blow him to the devil, boys! Pay him well for capturing inoffensive women. Give him hot shot! Sink him to --  ! Throw in grape! Samson, I say!" he repeated, in a furious tone, which was heard all the way to the mill, by old George. "Marsa John, what'r you bellooing so for?" asked the gray- headed coachman, making his appearance, with a portion of harness in his hand, the mountings of which he had been bur- nishing. "Samson! they are at it! Don't you hear the cannon? Hah! the desperate woman-stealer may prove too powerful for them! Samson!" continued the old Squire, rising, and with difficulty supporting his huge person on one foot, " get me down my sword from the wall. There; take the chair, and reach it." "Marsa, aih't you out of your head?" asked Samson, letting the harness fall, and staring at the excited Squire. Samson! why do you stand there, when I order you to get down my sword?" "Ha-ha-ha! are you gwien to ride or walk, Marsa, or to make me tote you?" "Blast your impertinence! Get the sword!" roared the old Squire. "Dam if I do! now you's got it!"  "The sword, I say!" again roared the swelling and foaming old squire. "- Now, now, see here, Marsa John! be quiet and reasonable!" "The sword, I say, or I'll cut your black head off!" "Taint black, now, Marsa John; 'twas once; and so was yourn; boff's white's cotton now! No, no, Marsa John; I'se too good a friend of you to let you have such a per'lous thing. You's too old, now. When de young men conq'r de pirates, 22-     - -     'ani- MONARCHST. den you kin bang 'em. You de mag'strat; but you's too old and enfarm to be soldier." "Once more, get me my sword, or by all that's furious I'll sell you, you impudent old scoundrel!" "Sell me! You darn't 'tempt it! you couldn't do widout Samson to save your life. A thousand pound wouldn't buy me, and you know it. For forty year you hab swore you would sell me, ebery time you got mad. Nonsense, man i Now, cool off a little, so's we kin 'iscuss dis'portant matter. What'r you gwien to do wid de sword? How are you gwien to de battle?" "In the boat, you infernal scoundrel! in the boat!" "That won't do, Narsa; I won't trust you, dat's flat! you's git drownded, and den I'll lose y ou and Samson kin no more do widout Marsa John, dan Marsa John kin do widout Samson." "Begone! you infernal -----" Samson vanished just in time to escape the chair which his enraged master hurled at him. The Squire then sank down in his seat, growling with discontent and panting from exhaustion. ie still sat with his broad face towards the bay, and could still small cannon. Ever and anon he uttered maledictions against the marauding captain, and encouraging words for the young Virginians. At last he paused, and maintained a breathless silence for some minutes, which was followed by an explosion of loud laughter, that shook his ponderous frame to its centre. i He beheld a fish-hawk, after hovering an instant over the sheet of water in the rear of the house, which was then at high tide, dart down and seize a fish some ten or twelve inches in length. But no sooner had the bird risen with its prize, than an eagle, which had been perched on a tall pine, came in pursuit of him. The hawk screamed distressfully, and rose in circles high in the air. The eagle followed. Round and round they flew, and at every turn both ascended still higher. The eagle, unencumbered, was the swiftest on the wing, and finally succeed- ed in rising above his victim. At that point the chase ceased. The hawk, aware of its danger, relinquished its prey, and sailed unmolested, screaming, to the pine, where it perched on the same limb its pursuer .had occupied. The eagle glided perpendicularly downward with the velocity of lightning, and when far below the descending fish, paused, turned over on his back, and seized the prize with his talons. He then bore it in triumph to the tree he had left, and proceeded to devour it beside the discon- certed hawk.   It was this occurrence which caused the explosion of laughter from 'the old Squire.                   * "Marsa, was dat you?" asked Samson, peeping in at the  door. "Yes, Samson! come here, and ll tell you news to make your old heart leap with joy." He described what he had seen. "Now, Samson, the eagle is America; the fish-hawk England. England preys upon the'world, but we shall take from her some of her prizes " "Dat don't make Samson's heart leap wid joy, Marsa John. It's a 'isgraceful shame to rob de King. 'Spose we should hab no King 't all? De world 'd be one black kaso!" "It might be-I am not certain. But George III. ought not to have pushed us to such great extremities. Never mind that. Samson! you dog, don't you hear?" "I do, Marsa John, and ebery bullet goes to my heart! De young gen'lemen 'ad better be home marrying, dan out dar fight- ing!" "Samson! send for all the horses; mount young negroes on them, and tell them to fly to the bay and bring me news of the battle i" a Marsa John, it shall be done. You's reasonable now!" "My passion is gone, Samson. But hurry!" "You 'knowledge you's a fool, den?" "Be off. I'm impatient for the news. Tell them to come back one at a time, and let me know everything that takes place. By St. George and the dragon! It grows hotter! Did you ever hear such booming?" These words were spoken after Samson had gone to do his bidding. But the messengers were too late. The battle was over before they reached the shore. The Victory had sunk three of Captain Philips's boats, and killed half his men; but she was then board- ed by greatly superior numbers, led by the captain himself, and taken. Most of the crew of the Victory, however, escaped in the small boats to the shore, which was not far distant. A few of the most desperate men remained and resisted to the last. These were made prisoners, and among them Thomas Custis, Captain Gibbs, Major Cropper (on a short furlough from the army), Lieutenant Handy, in a dying condition; John Dix, Edward Wise, Harry Parker, Richard Ayres, and George Poul- son. The barge "Victory" was abandoned by Captain Philips, under the supposition that it was in a sinking condition; but he placed the prisoners in his own barge and steered across the bay for the western shore.     256         THE MONARCHST. Among those who escaped was Robinson Custis; and in despite of the entreaties of his young wife, his sister Ann, and many other ladies who had witnessed the combat from the shore, he insisted upon having a large schooner belonging to his father- in-law, Squire West, armed and manned immediately to go in pursuit. But there was no ammunition; and the expedition had to be delayed until it could be procured. Among the rest who had been witnesses of the conflict, was Captain Waples, who arrived in the county that morning, but too late to participate in the battle. The pleasurable sensations attending the meeting with his friends, and particularly with Ann, were measurably marred by the termination of the combat in favour of the enemy. In the frenzy of excitement which ensued, he uttered a vow that he -would neither slumber nor sleep, until he had sailed in pursuit of the pirates, and to the rescue of his friends. Robinson Custis and his bride, Ann West, Sallie Luker, Ann Custis, and Captain Waples, returned with the squire's sable troop of messengers to the mansion at Deep Creek. The ladies uttered only lamentations, while the Squire and Waples vented maledictions. "Take my schooner, Waples," said the Squire, "and send the negroes in every direction to hunt powder. Here is money to buy it. The detestable tories would sell their shirts for money. They have all the powder. They say Master Bob put them up to it 1" And it was natural there should be distress in that company. Waples, so long separated frolm his mistress, and at last so nobly rescued by her, instead of being made the happy man it was supposed he would be, was about to leave her again for a theatre of bloody strife from which he might never return with life. Thomas Custis, whose wedding-day was appointed for the next week, was a prisoner; and George Poulson, who was to espouse Ann West on the same day, was likewise in the same predica- ment! How could they keep their appointments? Captain Philips sailed past the Atalanta without boarding. He had taken offence at the mysterious conduct of Captain Poole. Of course he looked for some sort of compensation when the fair prisoners'were restored to their parents and lovers. But in this he hadibeen disappointed; and he had even been denied access to his fair captives. This time he sailed directly for the Kingfisher, of sixteen guns, lying off the mouth of the Pianka- tank, and there surrendered his prisoners to the King's officer. The commander, although he could not recognise Captain Philips's   THE MONARCHST.         257 right to wage war without a commission from his majesty, yet found no difficulty in taking charge of the prisoners, inasmuch as they were Americans in arms, and, according to his logic, un- doubtedly rebels. Major Cropper protested against this proceeding, on the ground that it was a combat on the part of the otherwise peaceful citi- zens with a gang of pirates; and he insisted upon their libera- tion; but to no purpose. And if they were to be considered as prisoners of war, the fate of young Custis might be more deeply involved than that of the rest, as he was upon his parole, and if taken in arms against his majesty's forces, the penalty was death. The fate of Colonel Hayne was proof that the most rigid rules of the British service were enforced-with fearful precision; and the unhappy young man, seeing there was no possibility of escape from the vessel, and not venturing to have his name proposed with the rest for an exchange, in the event of being considered as prisoners of war, made application to the commander to have a letter transmitted from him to Master Robert Wales. This request, although he had scarce ventured to hope it would be granted., was readily complied with. Such was the singular in- fluence of Master Robert! 22*     5a00     THE MONARCHST. CHAPTER XXIV. Wilt thou not save him, when one word of thine Rescues the guiltless from impending death? Wilt thou ask nothing from the power divine, When death approaches, with thy failing breath? THE succeeding campaigns in the north seemed to produce no decisive results. The most startling occurrence was the treason of Arnold. When that event occurred, the Kingsburghs were in New York, whither Sir Henry Clinton and his army had gone. The fate of the unfortunate Andre had been pronounced, and there was universal sympathy in his behalf. Flora hastened up the river in the flag-boat, and appealing with irresistible eloquence to the tender nature of General Greene, who had presided at the trial, she obtained access to Washington. She was admitted the night preceding the morn- ing appointed for Andre's execution. When she entered the chamber, she beheld the Commander- in-chief alone, sitting with his elbows resting on a table, and his face covered by his hands. When he removed them, and mo- tioned her to be seated, she perceived traces of tears on his manly cheeks, and' thence seemed to derive a favourable augury. Unfortunately she was mistaken. "My dear young lady," said Washington, "I fear you come to petition for the life of the poor young Andr6; and I dread the pain of a refusal; but it must be so." "If it must be so, sir, then I need not speak in his behalf. Farewell, farewell for ever. But the features of your victim will be ever present to you in your dreams; and your own departure from this world may be as sudden-" "Young lady, denunciations, death itself, with all its attendant horrors, if horrors do attend it, could not swerve me from the performance of an important duty. But if you can urge any just reason why his life should be spared-if you can allege any tenable grounds of justification, for the remission of the dread sentence-I pray you speak. I would have the best light on the subject which is attainable." "The light of heaven gleams upon you! If you would   THE MONARCHST.         259 avoid an untimely end yourself, spare him! It is in your power to spare his life. The cause you champion would receive no detriment, nor your fame be diminished. It is a question simply whether you will exert your power in rescuing from an ignominious death, one who has been guilty of no moral wrong, and whose charac- ter is without a blemish. Life and death are in your hands!" "True! But in war, death to one's enemies, alike on the field of battle, or on the scaffold when taken in this manner, is indis- pensable to success." " dreadful alternative! A cruel pursuit! And is it em- barked in such a career that we find George Washington, the Christian, the man of tender sensibilities, the modest moralist!" "My country has imposed this service upon me. But you do not speak to the point. Believe me, this is the bitterest cup ever presented to my lips; and that I would sacrifice a portion of my own years to prolong those of Andre, if it could obliterate the act of which he has been convicted. A spy, and especially under the circumstances attending this treason, added to the escape of Arnold, to be spared, would rouse the indignation of the country, and tend to the demoralization of the army. What would be the consequences to myself, I know not, and care' not; I have not considered them; considerations of policy affecting only the in- terests of the country, have produced the sanction of the terrible sentence." "And you have not considered the consequences to yourself, if the sentence be carried into execution?" -"I have not; but they must be present pain and future regret -not regret that I so acted, but that there was a necessity for it." "Alas, sir, if it should be otherwise! It is your spotless cha- racter and moral weight, more than the brilliance of yoursdeeds, or the greatness of your mind, which uphold the cause you ad- vocate. If, then, it should be the decision of future generations that this man might have been spared, and should have been, how dark will appear this blot upon your memory when all else is so pure and bright! Think of the contrast!"' "Even if it should be so, it must be my misfortune. I must dare everything in the discharge of my duty." "Can that be a duty, the performance of which may be the subject of unavailing grief to yourself during the declining years of your life, and of reproach and condemnation on the part of future generations?" "Certainly not, if it were known that such results would ensue. But the contrary only is to be supposed. If I am mis-     260         THE MONARCHST. taken, God knows, and posterity will admit, that I acted from the best of motives, the desire to discharge my duty; and know- ing this, even if it be decided that his life might have been spared, they will not, they cannot, condemn me." "Oh, unhappy youth!" cried Flora; "no hope for thee! What can argument accomplish in thy behalf, when it is all against thee? Sir! have pity! Let me appeal to your gene- rous heart, not your reason!" "My dear young lady, I will weep with you; I havewept bitter tears during three sleepless nights. Every generous im- pulse in my breast has been excited in his behalf." "Then why not speak one word, which would end the need- less agony-Pardon!" "That word would be official--it is the man who feels. The man would appeal to you, as you do to him, were the fate of the prisoner in your hands. But the officer must perform his duty." "May God have mercy on us all!" "Amen!" said Washington, in a broken voice, and with a throbbing Jeart. No more was said. The interview was terminated. Flora whuld have seen Andr6, but he would not consent to it. He, however, intrusted to her a letter for Sir Henry Clinton, which it was important should reach its destination before his life expired. It was authority to dispose of his commission im- mediately, for the benefit of his mother and sister. It brought 5000.  Inflexible to the principle which governed his official conduct, Washington could not be moved to grant even the slightest miti- gation of the sentence of the court-martial. Andr6, as the whole world knows and deplores, suffered death upon the gallows. The ends of justice may have demanded his death; but no one could have revered the character of Washington less, if the brave young man's petition to be shot had been granted.   TILE MONARCHST.         - 1 CHAPTER XXV. Mere words can do nothing Against the fixed will; When one's mind is convinced What boots croaking of ill? THE DISPUTANT. MR. JEFFERSON was now the Governor of Virginia, and Master Robert Wales was his private secretary. The great apostle of democracy was already preparing the material for his celebrated "Notes on Virginia," which were published a few years after- wards. Master Robert, ever vigilant in the great mission he had im- posed on himself, had by no means relinquished the hope of see- ing the authority of the King re-established, at least in the southern portion of the states. Georgia was almost completely in the pos- session of the British. Gates, the conqueror of Burgoyne, .and the aspirant to succeed Washington, had been made, Commander-in- chief of all the American forces in the south. But, most un- fortunately for his own happiness, and for the welfare of the country, his first battle, at Camden, resulted in his overthrow by Lord Cornwallis. He was completely beaten, and his army fatally dispersed and dispirited. Never was the fall of a general, and so consummate a commander, in his own estimation, and in the estimation of many others, so sudden and so effectual. When victory had perched upon his banners, his triumphant despatches had been sent directly to Congress, disregardful of the etiquette due his Commander-in-chief, to whom his communications evinced a degree of reserve, and his language a haughtiness incompatible with their respective positions. But now, how changed! Hum- ble deprecation could go no further! He implored the coupte- nance and protection of his indulgent Chief, and lamented in the old-fashioned terms this new instance of the fortune of war. And Cornwallis seemed to be inclined to push his successful career northward, through the Carolinas, and perhaps into Vir- ginia, where Admiral Sir George Collier had arrived with a fleet and several thousand men. If a junction could be formed, and communications opened between Virginia and Georgia, one great     262        THE MONARCHST. step towards the subjugation of the southern states would be ac- complished. Generals Philips, Leslie, and Arnold (the traitor), commanded in succession the British troops in Virginia; and it was apprehended that the latter would wreak his vengeance on the inhabitants, particularly since Governor Jefferson had offered a reward of 5000 guineas for his capture. Wales had duly received the letter of his pupil, young Custis, and had procured his immediate release. The rest were likewise set at liberty, without an equivalent in exchange, as it was ad- mitted that Philips acted without authority. Major Cropper and others returned to the north, while young Custis, Poulson, and the rest, were sent in a transport-ship to their happy mistresses. Poulson was the son of the famous captain of that name who commanded a company at Braddock's defeat, aril fost all his men in the battle, but one-an unique occurrence in the annals of war. But our friend Waples was doomed to suffer a prolongation of his celibacy. Being landed on the western shore, when the schooner that had been sent in pursuit of the bucaneers re- turned to Accomac county, he was afterwards effectually pre- vented from following his friends by the daily accumulation of the enemy's ships in the Chesapeake. He at once joined Gene- ral Nelson, who was endeavouring to organize a force with which to oppose the British, until the Marquis de la Fayette, who had been detached to defend Virginia, should arrive with his army. The legislature was in session at Richmond. In obedience to the request of the Governor, instigated for some purpose of his own by Master Robert Wales, Captain Waples was ordered to bring intelligence to the capital of the progress of the enemy. He arrived early one evening with news which filled the Governor with terror, for his Excellency had always made it a point to ac- knowledge he was no soldier. "They are coming, to a moral certainty," said Waples; "and unless your Excellency can give us men enough to fight them, and men that will fight, they will be here in forty-eight hours." "I have no men," said Jefferson; "or not more than enough to protect the town, if they should approach." "And they will approach, if men enough are not marched against them to stop their progress. They are approaching now. They have left nothing undone behind them, and of course they will proceed to the work before them. Why the deuce are all our men in the north when they should be here in the south? A single regiment such as we had at Germantown--" "Never mind that, my young friend. It is past remedy, now,   THE MONARCHST.         263 But 'what have they done at Norfolk, Portsmouth, and Suffolk?' "They've done for them all, sir! They've burnt nearly every- thing combustible, and destroyed everything unportable that was destructible." "I hope they have not annihilated the soil, and set the river on fire?" said Master Robert. "Oh, but they have! I saw the river in a blaze with my own eyes. At Suffolk they staved in three hundred barrels of tar, pitch, and turpentine. The burning contents ran down into the river, floated on the surface, and absolutely crossed the Nanse- mond, still in flames!" "That was no phenomenon at all," said the Governor. "Doubtless philosophy can explain it rationally enough. But it was a miracle in the eyes of the old women and the loyalists. I wish philosophy, or principles of political economy, or some- thing else in the abstract, could arrest the flames of war before they reach the capital; that would be a charming experiment." "I am the commander of the militia, and it is incumbent on me to take measures immediately," said Jefferson, rising, and departing to the council chamber. "He is no general," said Waples. "He don't profess to be," said Wales. "It was wrong to issue a proclamation offering a reward for Arnold. He should not have known the Governor's purpose, and then it might have been accomplished. Now, Arnold, who has with him several hundred tories and deserters, will devastate the country, and be more apt to take the Governor than the Governor him. The militia cannot be depended on, as Wash- ington has said a thousand times." As the near approach of the British up James river -was an- nounced by successive messengers, Governor Jefferson was forced to act with great promptitude; and as he had several- hundred men at his disposal, and an abundance of cannon, Waples took it for granted that there would be fighting in defence of the place; and he was eager to have another chance at Arnold. But it was decreed otherwise. The cannon were ordered to be sunk in the river. When Waples heard it, he exclaimed, "Why, they can't be used there-unless the Governor's philosophy may con- vert them into some sort of a submarine battery." The Governor, however, had resolved upon his course. Richmond was evacuated. The small arms and ammunition, not needed by his troops, were conveyed a few miles to Westham, where they were deposited for safe-keeping. The Governor himself, with a squad of civilians, /J     264         THE MONARCHST. bearing the public papers, as well as his Excellency's private manuscripts, then took to flight. The British entered Richmond without opposition. The first thing they did was to take up the cannon, to which a hundred fingers pointed. Loyalists enough were left in Richmond for that. The next was to burn and pillage under the superintend- ence of Arnold; and the next was to despatch Colonel Simcoe, with a party of infantry and a few horse, to Westham, to bring back the arms and ammunition. All these things were done with promptitude, and amid great rejoicing. Then the enemy sailed down the river again. Meantime the Governor had ridden about the country a great deal. For three days he had made such exertions, as to have completely broken down his horse; and then some one mounted him on an unbroken colt, upon which he re-entered the capital. Baron Steuben, who had been disciplining a body of militia, and to whom Waples repaired, sword in hand, now hovered near the enemy; and General Smallwood, with three hundred men, repulsed them at City Point. Lafayette was likewise approach- ing, and the Governor, once more dismissing the dread of the British from his mind, plunged again into the midst of his loved political speculations. "Well, Master Robert," said the statesman, the evening of their return to the capital, " my illustrious campaign is over, and I am again in possession of my capital, the houses somewhat de- molished, it is true, but nevertheless the capital. Brick and mortar amount to nothing-principle is everything. A crown, you know, is not the gold band and jewels, but the authority with which it invests one." "And that is the true principle for which I contend. There should be a permanent source of power concentrated somewhere, whence all other authority is derived, and to which all must be subservient. Else there can be no unanimity or stability in the measures of government." "Granted," said the Governor, "s but that source should be in the people-in the majority-that is my theory." "And, as the old adage says, 'many men of many minds,' so there must, in thatocase, be many fluctuations of policy. The tree must be shaken so, often and so violently by the breath of the capricious multitude, that to produce any fruit will be an utter impossibility." "That is your serious conviction, Master Robert, and honest opinion. I think the contrary. The multitude will have the same incentives to good government that a monarch would have,   THE MONARCHST.         265 and their ministers would be quite as capable of managing their affairs, as those named by a king. A republic is a sort of part- nership; each individual a proprietor; and the agents selected by them to conduct the government, act from the highest autho- rity, the consent of the governed. But by what right can a monarch govern!" "The highest of all-the right Divine!" "How know you that?" "By the recorded decree of the Almighty. He says, By me kings reign, and princes decree justice-by me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.' He nowhere says his people shall choose their rulers at elections, or displace them." "But he says, 'Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to destruction.'" "True; and I fear we will all be involved in the destruction, unless this division be speedily healed." "Then, if I remember rightly, it is said in the Pslams, 'Let the saints bind the king with chains, and the nobles with fetters of iron.'" "True, again; but it was still by his special command and authority, and referred to a particular king. Your Excellency will admit, I presume, that you are no saint?" 'I fear I must admit that," said the Governor, smiling. "But .you know it is said, 'all flesh is grass.' I will not be shackled by a wisp of straw." "We are commanded," said Wales, " to 'fear God, and honour the king.' No other description of government is contemplated, or hardly alluded to in divine revelation; hence the Christian minister, or humble layman, who would obey God, must be a monarchist." "That is a monstrous inference! But is it not said He de- livereth David, his servant, from the hurtful sword-and it is he that giveth salvation unto kings?' If so, and there be meaning in the words, will he not deliver George III., and save him from the loss of the brightest jewel in his crown? Or if he does neither, is it not rational to infer that we act by his authority, with his full sanction, and that my maxim, vox populi vox Dei, is well founded?" "By no ieans! For a few years you may suppose you enjoy prosperity, and believe you have done right; but in the develope- ment of His purposes, a thousand years are as one day, and His will must ultimately prevail. He wills a monarchy: it is the form of government adopted both for heaven and earth." "And hell, too, for they say there is a prince of darkness. 23     266         TfE. MONARCHST. But, Master Robert, you will pardon me if I do not believe all these things quoted from that ancient book, the Bible. They will' do well enough for churchmen and kings. The state, by such authority, can sustain the church, and the church the state; but, in thus propping each other, I fear true religion falls to the ground. God is said to be merciful and just. His very nature is goodness, or there could be no salvation. Indeed, he must be incapable of wrong, or else his is not the nature, nor he the ex- alted being, the preachers describe. Well; upon what plea of justice, mercy, or benevolence, can they account for his com- mand to the Israelites to invade the land of Canaan, and put the men, women, children, and even the dumb brutes, to the sword?" "We should submit to him, not call in question his infinite wisdom." "Jesuitical enough. But I must be pardoned for not obeying the mandate of a superior, if it seems unreasonable in itself, until I am satisfied of its authenticity. Those ancient records are full of idle fables. Once they may have had a significancy, but many of them cannot apply to us, or to our time. At least the interpretations of them are of so doubtful a nature, that the devil himself, as has been said, and truly enough, may quote them for his purposes. If they be symbolical of events in this age, then King Belshazzar's warning, in his Babylonian halls, may be an archetype for King George. Let him read the MENE, TEKEL, &c., on his wall, and then glance at our scroll, and pon- der over the motto, SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS." "And this is so confidently said, when the troops of the King have almost the entire possession of the south! Surely, your Excellency must be in possession of information which justifies so bold a conclusion. I do not ask what it is; but I see that the struggle is to be prolonged, and that the great men of America will never yield on any terms but unconditional independence. That, too, might be justified; but then a de- mocracy! No king will be tolerated, because the people have quarrelled with a monarch!"And at that moment Wales deter- mined to adopt measures which he hoped would place Mr. Jef- ferson in the hands of the enemy. "That is wisely said," responded Jefferson, " and will be a powerful argument in favour of a republic." "But for me," said Master Robert, "a republic would be a crime. I should regard it as opposing the divine will, against which no opposition can prevail in the end." Tut! tut! You must not place implicit faith in the inter- pretations or speculations of the priests. Some of them, you   THE MONARCHST,         267 know (mind, I don't say alD, condemn the free use of wines and liquors; and for this doctrine they can produce scriptural autho- rity. And yet in Proverbs I find this language: ' Give strong drink to him that is ready to perish, and wine to those that be of heavy hearts. Let him drink and forget his poverty, and re- member his misery no more.' Now, I believe there is a God; and that his revelations are made continually. We feel them within ourselves; and if we act conscientiously, we prosper and have his sanction. Our success is the evidence of his approba- tion. I do not mean merely the execution of anything; but happiness successfully achieved on the basis of justice and mo- rality." "And there you pause; nothing is said of the future-of sin, of redemption; of eternal rewards and punishments." The subject was not pursued.     268         THE MONARCHST. CHAPTER XXVI. Marching and counter-marching, Confusion rules the hour; He who exults to-day, May to-morrow lose his power. THE SIBY'S WARNING. "ORD CORNWALLIS had formed a junction with Arnold at Petersburg; while Fayette was joined by General Wayne at Raccoon Ford. But yet the British carried all before them, having the superiority of numbers, and the Americans were forced to retire before their advancing steps. The time had not arrived for decisive blows. Lord Cornwallis was seated in the midst of his staff after a bountiful dinner; for nowhere the gold of the British failed to procure the best viands the country produced. For the depre- ciated currency of the Americans, only tough beef, depreciated hams, and poor poultry, were given. "Gentlemen," said Cornwallis, "we must catch this 'boy general' whom Washington has sent against us. It would be too ridiculous to be annoyed by a mere petit garon, and equiva- lent to a defeat to suffer him to elude us." "He has Wayne with him, however," said Arnold, "who is no boy, and will not be easily taken." "We must fitst cut off their stragglers, and then concentrate for the purpose of a final blow. At Point Fork, Baron Steuben has a detachment of six hundred men. Simcoe; what force will suffice?" "If your Lordship intends the honour for me, and I hope so, I shall not desire more than five hundred." "It would not be amiss," said Arnold, "for you to approach in such manner as to create a belief in the mind of the Baron, that the whole British army is upon him." Colonel Simcoe made a slight bow. The British officers loved the treason, but not the traitor. "Then, Colonel," continued Cornwallis, "make your dispo- sitions and perform this service as soon as you please. Now, Colonel," said he, addressing Tarleton, "I have an expedition   THtL IUN MNAtCtlS1bT.      Li for you. It is a novel one, and quite important-although the main object is the capture of but a single individual." "My one hundred and eighty men ought to be able to accom- plish that," said Tarleton. "And if they do, it will be an achievement second to none they have hitherto performed. The individual is Thomas Jeffer- son." At the mere mention of the name of that illustrious person, there was perceptible an expression of interest on the faces of all. "I have here," continued Cornwallis, "a note from our old friend Wales, stating that Jefferson is about to retire from the field, and from the gubernatorial chair, and de- vote himself to the pen, at Monticello. He must be taken there, before he has time to disseminate his republican doctrines in pamphlets. Here is the note, Tarletoh; you will find the approaches described, and every other information necessary for your guidance. And while you are at the work of capturing civilians, perhaps you may pick up some of the rebel legislators who are assembled in the neighbourhood. But, Colonel, I must once more impress upon you the importance of checking the licentiousness of your men. Three of them, however, will be hung to-morrow, for the outrage committed in the family of a loyalist. That may have a good effect. And I desire that no injury shall be done the premises at Monticello, or to the private property of other individuals. We have had too many bonfires; and the disgrace of them is reflected upon the honour of the officers," "Your Lordship is aware-it is next to impossible to restrain such a pack of blood-hounds as my troop. I cannot be present with all of the detached parties; and hence the occasional outrages you hear of. I hope the execution of the offenders referred to may have a salutary effect." "No doubt it will, Colonel. Surgeon Haughtonville," con- tinued his Lordship, smiling, and turning to the Doctor, "I have an account here of a most singular occurrence, which, perhaps, you can elucidate. I will read you an extract from the letter. It is from a member of the Royal Society. 'The Society is amazed at the substance of a communication from a sailor. He states that, having fallen from the top of the mast and fractured his leg, he had dressed it with nothing but tar and oakum, and yet in three days was able to walk as well as before the accident. Upon further correspondence the patient made the most solemn asseverations of having used no other remedies, and it does ap- pear beyond a doubt that the man speaks the truth.' Now, Surgeon, what is your opinion?" 23*     270         THE MONARCHST. "That mode of treatment never before occurred to me. But, your Lordship knows that new discoveries are continually being made. Gunpowder was an accidental invention; and there is in Philadelphia, a poor miniature painter, a mere youth, whose sign you may have noticed at the corner of Second and Walnut streets, who declares that we will live to see vessels and carriages propelled by steam. He is continually experimenting, to the neglect of his fortune. His name is Robert Fulton. In regard to the tar and oakum, your Lordship, they may possess extraor- dinary healing properties. Indeed, since I reflect upon the sub- ject, I remember that one of our artillerymen, who had a sabre cut on his hand, which became accidentally covered with tar from the hub of a carriage wheel, recovered almost imme- diately." "But if tar has such an effect, what good could the oakum have done?" "I suppose he meant the rope, and he used it in binding the application of tar to the limb." "Then, even if tar be so efficacious in the healing of flesh wounds, how can we rationally account for its magical influence on the fractured bone?" "That is the extraordinary part of it! I could wish your correspondent had been more copious in his details." "Oh, here is a postscript, which I overlooked, and which ex- plains the whole matter." "Read, read!" exclaimed several, who evinced much curiosity to learn the solution of the mystery. "Ah! here it is," said his Lordship, smiling; "a postscript in a postscript: 'Your Lordship will smile at the postscript to the sailor's last letter, which ran as follows: I forgot to tell your honours that the leg was a wooden one!"' The Surgeon was stricken dumb. Amid the merriment that ensued, Cornwallis perused other letters he had received. One, in particular, brought a smile to his lip. It was from Sir Henry, his Commander-in-chief. Clin- ton, after dwelling upon the victory of his Lordship over Gates, jocularly remarked that the defeat of that General was a service to Washington, and put the last of his rivals hors de combat. If Gates had succeeded in the south, as he had done in the north, while Washington was merely acting upon Walpole's maxim "Quieta non movere," the consequences might have been im- portant in the issue of the struggle, both as regarded the tenure of the American Chief's command, and the cause itself. But Sir' Henry could not blame his lieutenant for gaining a victory. He   THE MONARCIIIST.         271 hoped, however, that the laurels which had been stripped from the brow of Gates were not to be ultimately seized in turn by Washington himself from his Lordship. In the American camp there was not so much of the prestige of success apparent in the countenances of the leaders. But there were no symptoms of despair. Their hopes were in the future developments of the campaign. Young Lafayette was the embodyment of zeal and activity, combined with prudence and science. Wayne, his coadjutor, ever ardent, bold, and enter- prising, was, of all the generals, the best adapted to co-operate with the youthful commander. ' How much farther, General," asked the Marquis, "must one retire, before giving the coup de grace to his Lordship?" "We must find a position fitting for the occasion, and a thou- sand or two more men, before we can be able to arrest his pro- gress. But both will be found." "In effect, General, I can see nothing but his Lordship's de- struction, in the finale of this march. It is one fillet, a net, into which he is running. His strength will evaporate in the pursuit; and when he will wish to retrograde, we will assault his flanks, and trip up his feet. Then Count De Grasse may interpose at the other end of his march. It is a glorious occasion, General! We have him the more securely, the farther he advances into the interior!" "My opinion fully accords with yours. But there might be some profitable amusement in the interim, if we had more horses, and a few good riders. I have been looking for my young friend Waples.  Where is he?" "Oh, the brave officer whose mistress released him from pri- son, and who swears that since the British keep him from mar- -rying his deliverer, he is enlisted for the war?" "Yes; he has a double motive for wishing success to his country." He is with the Baron; but as the Baron himself is to ap- proach the main army, we shall soon embrace the gallant lover." On that day, and at about that moment, Baron Steuben was flying before Colonel Simoe, under the hallucination that he was assailed by the whole British army. It appeared that Sim- coe had not suffered the hintof Arnold to be lost. He knew the Baron had brought his men, to a perfect state of discipline, and that his own five hundred followers would not be likely to achieve an easy victory over six hundred. Hence he made his approaches in the form of an advanced Guard, and had so arranged every- thing as to make it appear that a yastly superior force was im-  , i     272         THE MONARCHST. mediately behind. This was a stratagem the rigid disciplinarian had not anticipated, and he escaped from the field with the utmost expedition, but not before Waples had dismounted one of the enemy and taken possession of his horse, which was better than his own. "My young friend," said the Baron, when the pursuit had ceased, "you had no authority to diverge from the line, to attack that officer." "It was not the officer I wanted, General, so much as his fine horse." "That was almost highway robbery, and some might call it murder. I saw him fall, when you fired." "True, sir; but he fired first, and wounded my horse; there was no alternative, then, but to have his." "Well, since you have a good steed, I will find you enough employment for him. Here is a note for the President of the Assembly. Take a dozen jnen with you. When the service is performed, you will report yourself at the head-quarters of the army." "It shall be done, sir, if possible." ' If possible? Nothing is impossible to a brave young officer like yourself." "I hope not. But then, in the first place, the address of his Excellency is not precisely stated on the envelope." "He may be at Richmond, at Charlottesville, or Staunton. To whatever place the Assembly may have flown, cannot you follow?" "Oh, certainly; but when that is accomplished, where shall I find our head-quarters?" "Is the army so small that you will not hear of its movements? It may be in a transition state; but you have taken a fine horse, and you know how to ride. In short, you must be governed by circumstances, and have a sort of carte blanche within your spe- cific instructions. Yet, beware of Tarleton! He is a terrible fellow!" "Twelve men will not attack two hundred. But, as this Colonel once took the liberty to address some polite words to Miss Custis, in Philadelphia, it would give me great pleasure to assure him to his face that he was very impertinent." "Impertinent for speaking polite words to a lady! She was your affianced, I believe. It seems to me, one-half the Americans are as much interested in the affairs of their wives and mistresses as in the great cause they are combating for. Beware, young   THE MONARCITST.          273 man, how you encounter Tarleton, or any of his men; else you may never return to speak any more polite words to Miss Custis yourself." Familiar with the country, Waples was soon galloping away at the head of his small troop. %-     274         THE MONARCHST. CHAPTER XXVII. Yet statesmanship, in pride of might, May, by the sword, be put to flight; E'en they who greatest nations sway, Mad bulls might force to run away. Since soldiers neither pray nor fast, Who shall forbid the rich repast? MR. JEFFERSON, domiciled at his own Monticello, had been dictating his "Notes" for several hours to Master Robert, whose pen had flown over the page with the rapidity of thought. Never had so great a man so great a secretary. His expedition with the quill was surpassed by his rapidity of references to historical facts, when desired by the statesman; and so retentive was his memory, so universal his reading, that when verbatim quotations were not required, he was enabled, without hesitation or delay, to state the substance of almost any passage it was necessary to bring in requisition. It was for such accomplishments as these, that Master Robert retained his influence and familiarity with the first personages of his day. Lesser intellects feared his powers. Jefferson used them. "When my book is published," said Jefferson, ceasing for a time from his labour, " what think you, Master Robert, will be the world's judgment on its merits?" "If the world ever sees it, sir, it cannot fail to make an im- pression." "If the world ever sees it? Why, I intend to publish it " "That you will have it printed, I have no doubt. To publish, is to promulgate, to proclaim. This, authors know nothing about; nor all the publishers either. Much depends upon the skill and disposition of the publisher, and more upon the acci- dental temper of the public. There are many accidents and contingencies to mar or make the reputation of a book." "Then I confess to being a novice; for I supposed everything depended upon the skill and ability of the author." *   THE MONARCHST.         275 "I am an author, and have some experience in these matters. I have written larger works than pamphlets." "Then your counsel will be advantageous. But what have you written?" "I must not tell; let it suffice that I have written and pub- lished; and that my experience has been derived from disap- pointment. I published anonymously, neglecting all the minor requisites of success, and the work failed; but that has not con- vinced me it was devoid of merit, since works, manifestly weak and puerile, have been extensively patronized, under the means and appliances of the trade. The first thing is to write a good book; the next, to select a good title; but the most important of all, is to treat with an accomplished publisher, who will push it through the world." "I had not thought of that. It is too late to change my title, for it has been mentioned to my friends." "Your friends will read your book-as you will be likely to give it to them--and perhaps they may praise it in return." "I have no expectation of realizing a fortune from it. The object is to disseminate correct information, and to sow the seeds of republicanism. That done, I will contrive to reap the harvest." '"Nevertheless, its success will not so much depend on its merits, as on the temper of the people. If your cause does not succeed, your work would be treasonable, and no one would print it; or if printed, but few would read it." "The cause will succeed. Although the enemy are traversing our territory at present, and may be, for what I know to the con- trary, not far distant from Monticello at this moment; yet I look upon our ultimate success as a matter of certainty. And when the sword is hung up, then the pen's achievements will assume the ascendency in the minds of mankind." "He who wields the sword at present, will not be suffered to stand aside that any other whatever may take precedence of him." "I am younger than Washington, and may bide my time. I am ambitious; but not solely for the pleasure of personal ele- vation. I must see my principles tested, as well for the welfare of the country, as for the fame of their author. In the field of polity which is to succeed the field of battle, Washington is not my equal. He has not studied the dispositions of the people, or the -sirce from whence all power is to flow. I see already the elements of his destruction. Hewill be the victim of popular discontent. Observe his courteous letters to the French officers, ,   , ) *     276         THE MONARCHST. and his apparent exuberance of affection for their nation. Ameri- can officers of equal abilities are overlooked to accommodate the aliens. This he justifies on the grounds of policy. Short- sighted policy! He will rivet the bonds of alliance with that nation too firmly to be severed abruptly, when a different policy shall seem to demand it. The Frenchmen will go home and republicanize their own nation. Voltaire and Paine have seen it in the distance, and proclaimed it to me. That will cause war with the monarchies; and Washington will be applied to to draw the sword for France, as France has done for America. Any one who knows his character well, need not be told that Washing- ton will do no such thing. On that rock he will split. Public opinion, the prejudice against the least appearance of ingratitude, and the desire, the duty, to aid in the propagation of republi- canism, will do the work." "This is penetrating far into the future, sir; but may not such speculations be based upon the mere creations of the imagi- nation?" "Not they! Ten years ago I saw the present as it exists. The Declaration of Independence was composed years before it was committed to paper. The power is within me to perceive coming events; and every vision has been hitherto realized." 'Because you laboured to realize them. You conceive an idea, and work it into form like the sculptor."  "It may be so; and as I do not intend to relax my exertions, I may reasonably calculate upon the realization of all my pro- jects." "But they involve the discomfiture of a friend-one who esteems your abilities highly." "So far as he is capable of comprehending them. It is not the man I would overthrow; but his principles. These are not definitely fixed, I 'am aware; he is not sufficiently conversant with history, law, literature, or the prejudices of mankind, to form any fixed system of polity. But that is not the case with the one in whom he reposes most confidence. Hamilton is my antagonist. Like you he is a monarchist, and founds his princi- ples upon the basis of his religion. He is a churchman, though no more a saint than I am. He will instil into Washington, not exactly his monarchical doctrines (for the cautious Washington never fully embraces any abstraction), but something analogous to them; perhaps a consolidation of the States, with an execu- tive having almost regal powers, and an aristocracy, which would be altogether antaggnistical to my theory. Hence, the necessity of his defeat before the great popular tribunal. Men are not to   THE MONARCHST.         2" be sustained unless their principles be good. He will have glory enough. Let him retire; it will be tie wisest step, and he prefers it. If 'he ventures into the sea of politics, or permits his friends to force him into it, he will there meet with storms and troubled waters which cannot be calmed at his bidding." "It is said he has troubles of a private nature now, which embitter his moments." "Yes; and the tales are true. He is losing money. Child- less as he is, he covets broad acres and large sums of money. After saying the stock-jobbers and others, who contribute to de- preciate the currency, and refuse to receive it at par, ought to be hung up as examples, to stimulate the patriotic spirit of the country, it was a sad blow to him to receive a letter from his agent at Mount Vernon, informing him that Mr. M  -- his friend and neighbour, who had purchased a farm of six hundred acres from him several years previously, had paid the debt in conti- nental paper! The land-and most excellent it was-realized him about three shillings an acre in specie! And the next post brought him information that his agent had employed Roberts, his miller, at a salary of 2000 per annum, in the same conti- nental currency! And moreover, vast sums, equivalent to specie when originally loaned out, were being repaid in the paper cur- rency, which he had often advised Congress to compel the people to receive at par! Why, at this rate he will soon be as poor as any of us; but then he might not be as good a republican." "You suppose, then, that in a monarchy one is better paid for his services, and that merit is more apt to be protectpd against the vicissitudes of fortune?"         4 Military men are better rewarded in a monarchy. "All men of merit are; while republics have ever been un- grateful." "However, just at this moment Washington is in no good humour with his Majesty. His Admiral recently made a domi- ciliary visit at Mount Vernon. Lady Washington was forced to fly to the interior; but Lund Washington, the agent of the General, being a non-combatant (something like myself), and anxious to save the premises from destruction, sought to con- ciliate the enemy by sending on board their ships the finest pigs and turkeys the General owned. Washington swore (and he can swear, for I have heard him) that he would have preferred to see his mansion in flames, and earnestly protested against the conduct of his agent, as if any one could suppose it had been done with his connivance and approbation!" 24     278         THE MONARCIIST. "i He will not blame his agent a few years hence. What would your Excellency do in the event of such a visit?" "I think I would follow Lady Washington's example." Just then, Cicero, his coachman, entered in breathless haste. "What is the matter?" asked his master. Goo--goo--goo--goo--" "Take breath; be calm; and you will not stutter so much." "Goo-good-Go-God! Ma-Mar-Marsa!" Well!" "The Bri-Bri-" "The British, I suppose. Well, go on; where are they?" "Mr. Jou-Jou-Jou-  Mr. Jouitte? Well; I know him very well. What does he say?" Tar-Tar-dat dam T-T--" "Who?

"Co-comn-dam-coming arter you, Marsa!" "Curse your stupid tongue! Put the horses to the carriage immediately! Tell Ned to saddle my horse! Drive the women and chil( over to Colonel Carter's! Go! lose not a moment!" Fortuirely the horses were already harnessed, and Cicero was on the road without loss of time. Ned, when he had saddled the horse, ran in with dilated eyes, the white portions of them predominating.. "Marsa, for God's sake run Run for your life, Marsa! De niggers is all gone to de mountain but me. I gp last, when you's gone, Marsa!" "Why such alarm?" asked Wales. "Have the enemy been seen approaching?" "Lor, yes! Dey's in sight, now!" And that stuttering hound has enabled them to approach so near before I could comprehend him!"Hastily exchanging coats and hats with Ned, the great statesman hurried from the house, and mounting his horse at the back gate, fled towards Carter's Mountain. He had not gone a hundred paces before he was con- fronted by two of the enemy.   THE MONARCHST.         279 "Who are you?" asked one of them. Where is Mr. Jefferson?" asked the other-who was Tarle- ton himself. "I saw him in the house two minutes ago," said Jefferson. "Come on!" said Tarleton; " don't lose the precious moments with such small game as that!" and they spurred forward and ran into the house. "Where is he?" asked Tarleton, rushing forward to where Master Robert was sitting. "Gone. He has fled. One of his negroes gave the alarm." "That can hardly be. I came by the back gate, and met a poor creature who said he had seen Mr. Jefferson here but two minutes before." "That was true. But he has escaped to the mountain. You cannot overtake him, now. Why did you not seize that poor creature?" "We did not wish to consume time with such a miserable object." "It is too late, now! But you must know that the miserable creature-and no doubt he was rather unhappy then-was Mr. Jefferson himself. He exchanged garments with one of his slaves. It seems to me you might have suspected something of the sort!" "Fury! My eye only dwelt upon his horse; a noble one t Stupid fool that I was! But I will have him, yet. To the mountain! Scatter out in every direction!" he continued to his men, who came pouring in from different directions. j ide up every valley; guard every pass; and sleep at your : in the woods, if you see him not, and find no traces of hi. If he does not come out to-night, to-morrow we will dismount and go in. We must beat every bush, and explore every cave." Master Robert was soon the sole occupant of the mansion. And the first thing he discovered, which both surprised and chagrined hif, was that Jefferson, leaving all things else, had taken his "Notes" with him! Such is the tenacity with Which a hopeful author (and how few are otherwise!) clings to his manu- script. There was nothing else upon the premises that Wales desired to possess; and not supposing that Jefferson would sus- pect him of being privy to the attempt to seize his person, he 'determined to remain quietly where he was. There were other fugitives who had been compelled to fly be- fore the furious British troop, and had taken shelter in the same mountain. These were Waples and his twelve men. But their     280         THE MONARCHST. fight had not been so bloodless. Two of Tarleton's troopers had fallen in the chase. Waples had designed resting that night at Monticello, and was within a few miles of it when he fell in with Tarleton. He de- layed his retreat some minutes, in hopes of meeting with the Colonel himself; but such was not his fate, or fortune. From his high position Waples had observed the approach of Jefferson, and he contrived to keep his eye upon him. On the flying statesman came. Ditches and fences interposed no hindrances to his career. His blooded steed bounded over them all with ease. The long, yellow, homespun coat he wore, stood out behind like a tattered flag in a hurricane. "Who the deuce can he be?" exclaimed Waples. "His course, if he does not change it, ll bring him near to this spot. What a magnificent horse! Squat, hide, all of you! He dis- mounts. He has turned his horse loose; and yonder the enfran- chised animal goes like a streak of lightning, and snorting like thunder! But no one could ride up at that place." The ascent in some places was difficult even for a man on foot; in many it was impossible for a horse. Jefferson, sometimes hidden for a moment from view by intervening rocks and cedars, came on, in as straight a line as possible, towards the covert of Waples. He did not seem to heed anything that might be in front of him; but at every third step he cast a glance behind. Pale and panting, he continued to push forward, until he en- countered a large fallen tree. Here he paused; and after scan- ning t i untry below with much care, he seemed to enter upon an ex Irtioi of the huge trunk before him. For this purpose he tra -Rdone side and then the other, until he' reached the stump of it; he then halted, and seemed to start with pleasure on finding it to be hollow. In the aperture he deposited his pre- cious manuscript, and concealed the opening with dry brush, bark, and leaves. This done, he continued his flight towards the tall grass and laurel bushes where our partyof Americans were concealed. At last he threw himself down in their midst, and within a few feet of the hiding-place of Waples, who rose up and seized him. H-a-h!" cried he, in a startling voice. "The devil must have guided me into the jaws of the enemy! Well, what do you want? I am no soldier! I possess nothing of value but my- manuscripts, aud they are safe beyond your reach. You will not take my life. I am not in arms. I have nothing but my pen-knife." "Who are you? Why are you hiding here?" asked Waples.   THE MONARCHST.         281 "Oh, I am only a poor farmer-a civilian-no soldier. But my house has been assaulted by the enemy, and I have fled hither to escape their vengeance." "Vengeance on a poor farmer! You do not talk like a poor farmer, nor did your horse look like a poor farmer's animal. You speak of the enemy. The whigs call the British enemies; the tories the whigs. Are you whig or tory? Lift your beaver, and let me see your face. - Why, bless my life! Governor, is this you?" "Hush'! not so loud. And you-oh, I remember! My dear young friend, this is an agreeable surprise. Let me embrace you! But we must be circumspect. Tarleton and his men are at Monticello, or rather were thee, and are now in pursuit of me. We must not stay here   ou have not men enough," he added, looking round at t f ve. They have not foll  0ou, Governor," said Waples. I saw every foot of the g j ou came over. But why did you abandon your noble h   ' By entering a little valley to the east, you might have led him up to the plateau where ours are browsing." "No, no; the ground is soft, and they would have tracked him, as they will yours." "I hope so!" said Waples. "The path is narrow. They could not please me better. They will find the riders before they dis- cover the horses. But now your noble steed will fall intoheir hands." "Not he, unless they shoot him. My Ned is the,  eing who can put his hand on the mane of that animal.   you saw me approach; did you see me pause anywher    y?" "Yes; we saw you stop at the old trunk, and hb thing in the hollow of the stump." "True; it was something of no value at present to any one but myself-and yet it may be of incalculable value to future generations. It was my book, which I am preparing for publi- cation. I am glad you saw me; for if I should be taken or killed, you will tell my friends where to find it. Yonder they come! I see them dividing into parties to surround and scour the mountain. Remember all of you, for some one may survive, that my work is deposited in that stump. The greatest service you could do your country, if I should fall, would be to take my 'Notes' to Patrick Henry, or to Mathew Carey, in Phila- delphia." "There is a party on your track, Governor," said Waples; "Iet me see; fourteen or fifteen. Good. Now, Governor, if 24*     282         THE MONARCHST. you want to see some fine sport, just climb that tree, where you can overlook the ground. If they cannot trace your course after you dismounted, we must assist them by rolling down some peb- bles." "Don't, I beseech you! I assure you such scenes afford no sport for me! On the contrary, I should be delighted to see them gallop away." "And I should be bitterly disappointed; because my instruc- tions, and want of numbers, would prevent me from pursuing. I may, however, stand in my defence, and in defence of your Excellency." "No; I would rather hide-but not up in a tree, to be shot down like a squirrel.

"Excuse me, Governor; but si    have thrown up your office, I must obey others. Gov s elson desires to have Tarleton and his men exterminate  shortest possible space of time." "The Governor's Tdy, I rs. Nelson, was at Monticello, with my family when they approached; but they are all safe by this time at Colonel Carter's."  "I suppose the Assembly has taken wings again and flown away from Charlottesville. I have a communication for their Speaker.

Are you aware there are but few passes by which you can leave the mountain, and these guarded, there is no pos- sibility of withdrawing unobserved?" "I shall clat a road through them, then! If they guard all the passes, they cannot have more than fifteen or twenty men at any one point.'-' "I will not travel over your road. I will remain in the moun- tain until they retire." "As you will, Governor. But I should like for you to see them mowed down. They must be particularly anxious to catch you; and I wonder at it, since you are no longer the Governor." "And merely a poor farmer," said Jefferson, smiling, for the first time. "' It is strange they have not burned your house. I passed, thirty-nine smoking ruins yesterday, and ninety-eight dead colts,   THE MONARCHST.         283 whose throats had been cut. I have been looking for the smoke, but see none as yet." "It is not Monticello they wish to destroy, so much as my manuscript! and that is safe! Even if they. catch me, and pre- vent me from writing more, that book, which I have charged you to rescue from destruction, will injure the royal cause more than ten thousand swords can do." "That may be as you say, Governor, and I will not deny it, because I know nothing about it; but if you will pardon me, I must say I would rather rely upon the cold steel just now. They have dismounted! They have found some fragments of the skirt of your coat in the briers, and are coming this way. Down, men, and wait for the word!" "One of the tails is gone, see enough!" said Jefferson, exa- mining his garment. "I will retire farther up the mountain," he continued, suiting the action to the word. "And be sure to select a place where you can see us," said Waples, in an undertone; "and if the affair grows hot, you must shout like the devil, and pretend to beta reinforcement." The further ascent of the ex-Governor,. must have been ob- served by the British, who dashed as impetuously as possible up the side of the mountain. Some four or five of them pushed forward in advance of the rest. - It would have been considered difficult to ascend at all with their accoutrements, had they not been under the influence of excitement; for their swords, un- drawn, were continually becoming entangled in the bushes and vines. "Rise!" cried Waples to his men. "Surrender!" saidle, to the foremost party of the British.      ?  Though greatly amazed, the British, aware that their comrades would soon be up with them, and perhaps Tarleton himself might be observing them, stood upon their defence. Neither party used their pistols. So they lost no time in crossing their swords; and the Americans, though deficient in skill, were superior in strength of arm, not being fatigued; and they had the advantage of position. The clashing of steel, the shouting of voices, and the oaths, made altogether a very disagreeable concert for the ears of the ex-governor. But when he perceived that all the British had come up, and were decidedly superior in numbers to their oppo- nents, he trembled again for his own safety, and more for the safety of his manuscript. Thus becoming desperate, and recol- lecting the advice of Waples, he set up a most furious shout, and cried aloud, while beating the bushes, and rattling down cartloads of loose stones : "Come on, my men! There they are!     284        THE MONARCHST. surround them! surround them! Don't let one escape! We have fifty, and they only fifteen! Get below, and cut off their retreat!" These words were distinctly heard below, and had a magical effect on the British. Believing themselves really about to be surrounded, and their retreat cut off, those of them who could run, made a precipitate retreat, and never paused until they were in the saddle. Four of them were wounded too severely to attempt an escape, and remained, disarmed, on the ground. Of the party of Americans, not one escaped unhurt. It is per- haps the only instance on record in the annals of the revolutionary war, where every man engaged on one side was wounded. But fortunately, not one of them received a mortal hurt. The gashes were mostly of a trifling nature, not even requiring the services of a surgeon. "They are off; defeated!" said Mr. Jefferson, returning to the scene of the recent conflict; " but you must attribute the victory, in great part, to my reinforcement." "I could wish your Excellency had delayed bringing forward your succours for a few minutes longer. We have four, and might just as well have had eight." Waples said this while wrapping a handkerchief round his left arm. ' My dear young friend, you have had fighting enough. Two of them were hacking at you all the time; and when I saw the third approach behind- " -- "I saw him too," said Waples; "and if you had not frightened him off, the next step he took would have been his last. t I was just preparing to turn-" "And then those in front would have slain you." "No; they were nearly disabled, as they aan bear witness themselves; for there they are." "I feared for my manuscript," said the ex-Governor. "D-n the manuscript! Pardon me, Governor, for using the word. But, in battle, everything depends upon good fighting." "Believe me there is nothing good in it. Blood and death! If revolutions can only be effected by such means, I will never engage in another. No; the pen, the pen is the proper instru- ment!' "A quill will do to fly with; but it can never drive back an enemy, sword in hand. Now we must cure these poor fellows, if possible," continued Waples, approaching the wounded pri- soners, and inquiring into the extent of their injuries. From them he learned that Tarleton had received an order, within the last half hour, to set out immediately, and join Colonel Simcoe,   THE MONARCHST.         285 who was marching for the head-quarters of the British army. Therefore the Ex-Governor had nothing further to apprehend. And soon after, the recall of the bugle announced that the Bri- tish were about to retire from the pursuit. A messenger was despatched for a cart to convey the prisoners to Monticello, where it was decided they should remain, at least until their wounds were dressed. A few hours afterwards, Waples, leaving three of his men at Monticello, who were the most seriously injured, proceeded by the great road over the Blue Ridge towards Staunton. He could not be prevailed on to spend the night at Mr. Jefferson's house, as he had at first designed. Tarleton's summons to head-quar- ters seemed to indicate that there would soon be sport on a larger scale. The next morning, after descending the mountain, our little party were attracted by the savoury odour of a warm breakfast, which had been served up at a fine mansion on the road-side. "Perhaps they will ask a few poor soldiers to join them," said Waples; "but it is a private mansion, and not an inn; remember that," he added, to his men. "We are very hungry, sir; and we hope you will halt and see if they will not let us have something to eat and drink," said the sergeant. "Drink, especially," said one of the men. "There can be no harm in making a civil request," said Wa- ples, pacing up the lane at the head of his party. "Hilloa!" he cried. No one answered, or appeared in view. "Hilloa, I say!" he repeated, while his horse ran his head over the palings, and sought to snatch a mouthful of luxuriant grass from the tempting lawn. "It is verv extraordinary! Why the deuce don't they come out?" "May-be nobody's in!" said the sergeant, with a quizzical smile. "I smell the meat and the coffee," said Waples; "surely some one must be near Let us dismount, and go to the house." They did so; but still saw no human being, nor even a dog to bark at them. From the cellar to the garret they searched in vain. But there was the table in the breakfast room, laden with delicious viands, flanked by snowy bread, and headed by an ample pot of hot coffee, with all the other necessary append- ages. The truth flashed upon our party as they stood gazing at the delicious temptation. The family had evidently seen them approaching when upon the eve of sitting down to breakfast;     286        THE MONARCHST. and supposing them to be the terrible Tarleton and his men, they had run precipitately to the woods in the rear. Waples could resist no longer; so turning their horses upon the lawn to regale on the rank rich grass a few minutes, they sat down and helped themselves without stint. They were just able to con- sume everything edible on the table, and could have eaten no more. In a sideboard they found rum, brandy, and wine, which it was impossible not to partake of in moderation, and difficult to prevent some of the party from taking too much of them. Waples, after leaving a courteous note, stating particularly what had been the famishing condition of his men and horses, and that it had been his intention merely to solicit the hospitality of the proprietor, set out upon the road again, at the head of his well-satisfied party. Some of them, indeed, were excessively joyous, and sang merry songs as they rattled along. It seemed an extraordinary thing to Waples that he met with no one on the road. The country was beautiful. It was near midsummer; and the fields, well cultivated, and promising an abundant harvest, showed plainly that there were many dwellers in the land; but no one was to be seen. Flocks of cattle were grazing in the green pastures; the lambs were skipping about in frolicsome delight; the hens were cackling in the barn-yards; the pigs were squealing, the geese were gabbling, and here and there a horse might be seen harnessed to the plough; and yet no human being greeted their astonished vision. "Undoubtedly," said Waples, "the whole country has becomne alarmed at something, and it may be at us; if so, how easy a matter must it be for Tarleton to accomplish his devastations where a panic has preceded him. We can't find even a negro!" "The niggers hate him and fear him, every bit as much as their masters," said the sergeant. "It is said three-fourths of all he literates die of small-pox." "No wonder they fear him. But it is very strange that we should be taken for the enemy; ten men to alarm the entire po- pulation of such a vast region of country! If they would only look at us a moment they might be convinced there was no dan- ger, even if we were Tarleton's men." "That's it. They won't take time to count. They just get a glimpse, and away they run, no doubt reporting as they go that the whole army of Cornwallis is coming." They continued on at a brisk pace, the lords of all they sur- veyed. All things were at their command. They had only to stop and take them. When they arrived in the vicinity of Staunton, they captured   THE MONARCHST.         287 a small negro boy they had discovered peeping at them from a dense thicket. But he was so much frightened that they could not get him to speak intelligibly. "Let him alone!" said Waples, in vexation. If the grown people are frightened out of their wits, what can you expect from  the children? Go, you little rascal," said he, "and tell your master that we are Americans-and not the bloody Tarleton and his thieving dragoons." What a change! No sooner were these words spoken, than the horses of our party shied- in every direction, as if a shower of missiles -had been discharged at them. From every part of the thicket, from the fences, from the ditches, human heads were seen rising into view! The country was inhabited. The people, white and black, male and female, came round our party with many joyous smiles, and congratulating themselves on being de- livered of their fears. But the Assembly itself had taken the alarm, and was at that moment flying for safety, they knew not whither. Waples, escorted by many of the inhabitants, rode up to the inn, and prevailed on the landlord to send messengers after the panic- stricken legislators. Neither himself nor any of his men durst venture-after them, lest their flight should be accelerated. More than six hours elapsed before the Assembly returned to the court-house which they had abandoned so precipitately. And when they returned, many of them evinced in their faces the shame and mortification they felt. They were not without ex- cuse, however; Tarleton had assailed them more than once, and had at that moment a number of the members of their body in captivity. And, besides, it was known that Lafayette and Wayne were retreating before the superior numbers of Lord Cornwallis. !      288         THE MONARCHST. CHAPTER XXVIII. Authors are prized, like skilful cooks, Not for their virtues, but their books. Through others' works, sometimes, I ween, Deserving men remain unseen. VILLAGE SATIRIST. BY the time that Mr. Jefferson reached his mansion, most of his slaves had returned to it from their hiding-places. But Master Robert, it seemed, was nowhere to be found. Mr. Jef- ferson, never suspecting that his secretary had laid the plot for his capture, came to the conclusion that the British, supposing he had finally committed himself to the American cause, had at last seized him, and would perhaps take his life. This was an unpleasant thought, because Master Robert had been, and could yet be, of infinite service to him; and because he could not per- ceive the necessity of wreaking their vengeance on one so inca- pable, apparently, of doing them any injury. When the great statesman entered his library, once more, still habited in the garment of his servant, he sighed on behold- ing the great confusion into which everying had been thrown. The cases and drawers were open; the books were scattered in every direction, and lying in heaps upon the floor. "Thank God it was a fruitless search!" he said, at length, sitting down and drawing his beloved "Notes" from his breast. "This is the treasure they wanted, next to my person," he con- tinued, turning over the pages. "But they have been disap- pointed in both, thanks to my brave defenders, and their gallant leader, Waples! Eh!" he exclaimed, perceiving a sudden move- ment under the table, where there were a hundred volumes thrown together in a pile. What is that? Oh, merely a book sliding down. How will I ever get my library in order again? Or how go on, without my little secretary?" inIs that your voice, Mr. Jefferson?" asked some one, quite invisible. "Who are you? Where are you?" said the statesman, rising suddenly, but not answering the question which had been asked him.   ! THE MONARCHST.                 289 "I am your secretary. Feel in your pocket." In my pocket!" said Mr. Jefferson, making an involuntary attempt to do so, but the skirt being gone on the side to which his hand was extended, he was instantly convinced of the ridicu- lousness of the supposition. "That is your welcome voice, Master Robert. I am glad I have not lost you; but still I can't find you. Where are you?  Come forth!" "You must help me. These ponderous tomes lie heavy on my breast." This was succeeded by another stir. among the books under the table. "Is it possible you are there?" exclaimed Jefferson, stooping down, and removing some of the folios and quartos. "Truly a book-worm " he added, when Master Robert's face was un- covered. "Yes; I have dived deeper into these tomes than any one else ever did before me, except the authors; and have proba- bly derived a greater benefit from them than the authors them- selves. Your hand, if you please!" The next moment Master Robert was extricated; and adjusting his clothes, he resumed his old seat at the table opposite to Mr. Jefferson. "How did you contrive to conceal yourself in that manner!" asked Mr. Jefferson, still looking under the table. "I built a sort of cave with the books and crawled in; but the troopers threw more on the pile (and they had assisted him) and tumbled everything into confusion." "Ay, in quest of my manuscripts. Well, I am rejoiced we have escaped on such easy terms. I learn they have destroyed nothing on the premises, and that is surprising, since they have made such havoc elsewhere in the neighbourhood." A servant came in with letters from the post-office, and among them was one for Wales from Colonel Hamilton, the contents of which made Master Robert smile. "What agreeable news have you there?" asked Mr. Jefferson. "News from head-quarters. Colonel Hamilton says his Chief is actively engaged in an enterprise to relieve the -Marquis de La Fayette, who is retreating before the enemy in Virginia, and calling lustily for succour. He even desires Washington him- self to move southward with all his forces. The Colonel says Washington is much diverted in anticipation of the inevitable result of his present enterprise against the city of New York, and writes to his dear Marquis to continue his retrograde march in good order, but with a firm countenance, and to restrain General Wayne, who would make a stand, until assistance is received 25     290         THE MONARCHST. from the Commander-in-chief, which may be speedily expected. That assistatnce or relief will be afforded in a combined move- ment of the American and French forces towards Sir Henry Clin- ton's army. It will render necessary a concentration of the British at the point menaced; and as a consequence, Lord Corn- wallis will receive orders to draw his army back towards the bay. Washington, Hamilton says, is already framing a complimentary letter to the Marquis, in answer to the one he will look for, an- nouncing the retreat of Cornwallis; and he is determined to at- tribute it all to the conduct of his young friend. -But that is not all. Washington, as soon as he makes a dash at the city, is really to make a rapid march in this direction, and intends to finish the campaign in Virginia. It is skilfully concerted, and would do honour to the strategy of a Marlborough. De Grasse, with twenty-five sail of the line, and 3000 soldiers, will arrive about the same time in the mouth of the bay. Thus my Lord Cornwallis will be hemmed in on all sides. A blow will be delivered which will be a virtual end of the war!" "That is plausible; it is quite probable." "Nay, sir, I think it inevitable." "Perhaps it is. Washington is making the most of his time and means. I am not one of those who think a better Com- mander-in-chief might have been appointed. I give him credit for the substantial abilities he displays; they are the very kind we need. No man living could have served the cause so well. His greatest merit has been in maintaining a military and even a political show of resistance, at times when another general would have despaired, and when the hopes of the country might have been effectually blasted. He has likewise improved him- self in the science he loves, from experience, from reading in the camp, and from association and correspondence with great mili- tary captains. But, then, le is running into a dilemma from which there can be no escape. My letters from very reliable sources state that he regards the fate of Cornwallis as already sealed, and that the French Generals and Admirals are to have the most conspicuous places assigned them in the glorious field on our soil. If great results follow, of course an immeasurable debt of gratitude will be due to the French nation; and a refu- sal at any time to return the service in kind, when called upon, will be monstrous, even in the liberator of his country. Well, any one who knows Washington's character thoroughly, must be aware that when our independence is established, and peace re- stored, that he will engage in no foreign war. He will pay   THE MONARCHST.         291 France the debt in any coin but that! But a majority of his countrymen may not relish his policy!" Another messenger arrived at Monticello, bringing intelligence from Staunton, that the charges which George Nicholas had preferred against Mr. Jefferson (for what was merely ineficient conduct while Governor, and when panic-stricken by the incur- sions of the enemy) had been dropped; and that the. Assembly had again, almost unanimously, chosen him to be a representative in Congress. "You will accept?" "Certainly, But at the proper time I must meet my friends and correspondents in Paris. Will you continue to be my sec- retary?" "Not abroad. And yet you may see me in France. But I shall desire to meet again with the great chief, and to witness the termination of this campaign. You will grant my request, when I assure you that I have relinquished the idea that it is at all possible for George III. ever to resume control over these states. His ministry, and his own stubbornness, have lost him his colo- nies for ever. My next object, and the only hope now remaining, is to see an American on the throne." "Then you abandon, likewise, the doctrine of the divine right of kings?" "Not exactly. God may overthrow old dynasties and establish new ones at pleasure, and the new sovereigns be as much the Lord's anointed as the old ones. If it was not the Lord's will that the descendants of the Princess Sophia should be dispossessed of their inheritance, he will yet punish the people who trans- gressed, in his own way, and in his own time." "I suppose another Joshua will command the sun to stand still, while a new Gideon will slaughter the Americans. But, unluckily for the veracity of the ancient record, the sun always did stand still!" "And yet the almanacs use the words rising and setting of the sun, at this day." "Then, if the6 world stopped turning round, which is going at the rate of sixteen miles a minute, our philosophy teaches us that every object on its surface would have been instantly dashed to atoms. There would have been no necessity for casting down stones from heaven to demolish the enemy." "Nothing is impossible with God. His power, wisdom, and goodness are not to be comprehended by his creatures. But, sir, did I not hear you say young Waples came to your relief, when you were pursued by Tarleton's men?"     292         THE MONARCHST. "Yes, truly; and I came to his relief, when he in turn was hard pressed. I met with him in the mountain. He had been sent with a message for the Assembly, and had fallen in with this bloody troop; but finding himself too weak to keep the field, he had fled thither for refuge. There he encountered a party of my pursuers, and fought them within sight of me. I made some stir in the bushes, pretending to be leading forward a re- inforcement, and thus relieved him." "Waples, you know, was one of my pupils." "Oh, yes; you serve me continually, in spite of yourself; and when I arrive at-at the position I aim for-I hope to be able to evince my gratitude; if it can be done without shocking my republican friends. You know one of my mottoes is 'everything for principles, nothing for men.' I have impressed this on my partisans as their first lesson." "IRepublican honours and emoluments I fear will be found rather precarious and evanescent. On the other hand, a kingdom once established, you would be, at the very least, the Duke of Monticello; perhaps a Prince; and be made the lord of more than forty thousand acres of the lands belonging to the govern- ment. There never was a better opportunity for the erection of a mighty kingdom, and the creation of nobles. Such, sooner or later, must be the case. Then, the philosopher, the warrior, the inventor, the statesman, and the poet, however much they may be neglected by the unappreciating multitude, will be re- warded and protected by generous sovereigns." "My sovereign is the People. Washington may be their first choice; their next-no matter. The Declaration of Independ- ence is my patent, and will link my name with eternity, even if this body should be doomed to starvation." "True. That great achievement will be the subject of undy- ing fame; and your perfect organization of a republican party, when completed, may exalt its author to the highest place in the state; but as rotation in office is to be one of the elements of the new doctrine, you will have to give way for others, and in a few years, perhaps, your descendants may derive no benefit whatever from your achievements. To enjoy all the benefits yourself, to the exclusion of your own posterity, would seem to be a degree of selfishness inconsistent with our nature. And yet it is so. Your doctrine denies the right of distinction derived from illus- trious ancestors. This is unnatural, and therefore unsound. Such a system cannot endure for many generations. There will soon be too many descendants of distinguished individuals to permit such an idea to prevail.' It is exploded daily, and practi-   THE MONARCHST.         293 cally, in the simple importation of horses and other stock of su- perior quality to breed from." "Your doctrine may answer, and undoubtedly it does answer, so far as the dumb brutes are concerned. But with intellectual beings it is quite a different thing. We are all equal, whether rich or poor, high or low, in the scale of natural rights." "And while we are helpless infants," added Wales. "But equality in power and position, in acquisition and influence, among men, is not to be thought of, no more than an equality in the height of trees and mountains, or in the physical conforma- tion of our species-"  "Ay, you have ground of complaint," said Mr. Jefferson, interrupting him, and smiling. "But I do not complain. Would you advocate this doctrine of equality, if you knew that every man was your equal? I think not. You know they are infinitely your inferiors, and that you are capable of moulding public opinion into such forms as shall suit your purpose. When I see all the great republicans adhere steadfastly to a resolution not to mount above the com- mon converts to their creed, then I shall have cause to believe there may be something good and tenable in their doctrines. That noone will ever behold. As well might on6 suppose that upon an equal distribution of wealth, all would have equal pos- sessions ever after!" "We shall do away the laws of primogeniture, and entailed estates; so there will be a distribution of wealth," said Jefferson. "I suppose the wheel once set in motion, it must run the whole revolution. The unprotected children of opulent parents, if they have the misfortune not to be gifted with equal talents of acquisition, will be the lawful victims of fraud and cupidity. Why, my dear sir, Monticello itself may be brought to the hammer in a half century, and your grandchildren may not be recognised by the high functionaries then administering the affairs of your beautiful government!" "I have derived no benefits from my ancestors. I know not who they were three generations back. Let my descendants carve their own fortunes as I have done, or mean to do, mine." "' So be it, if it must be so!" said Wales. "But a govern- ment must be based on good foundations to stand the test of ages. When it fails to secure justice, it is a failure of the ex- periment. The ultimate result of your democracy, it seems to me, will be this: all the wealth will be in the possession of sharpers, and all the political power in the hands of dema- gogues!" 25* '     294         THE MONARCHST. ' Master Bob, that is a very strong declaration! You suppose there is neither virtue nor intelligence in the people, and that they are incapable of acquiring them." "They can never acquire enough, or rather enough of them will never acquire any, to form the majority." "You are in error there. The great body of the people are the most interested in good government; and it will be found that they are capable of studying sufficiently what will be the best for their own interests. Teach them that all power belongs to them, and they will guard their rights. Instead of being the victims of the oppression of irresponsible kings, their rulers will be their servants, liable to be called to an account at any mo- ment. Hence all great functionaries will study to originate measures that will produce the greatest good to the greatest number." "It may be hoped for, but I fear the evidence of it will not be seen. I ha,. Ao faith in it." "Wait for the evidence, Master Robert; do not prejudge a system yet untried." Mr. Jefferson, throwing aside the coat of his slave, which had still remained on him, and resuming his own, walked to and fro several times across the room. His erect stature seemedito tower still farther above the ordinary standard of his species, as he paused at the west window, and his eagle eye swept over the extensive scene below, now illuminated by the rich tints of the descending sun. Thought was stirred within him. His gigantic intellect seemed almost to emit effulgent rays from his brow, and an expression of triumph beamed upon his features, as the vision of his future elevation appeared before him. Wales, whose eye followed the statesman, and observed his fixed determination, felt that no human interposition could arrest the course, or combination of circumstances change the destiny of such a man.    THE MONARCHST.         295 CHAPTER XXIX. War is but a game Which the Immortals play, Though men may seem to win The honours of the day. TIIE Marquis de la Fayette was the victim of a distressing perturbation. On the one hand, Count de Grasse, with his fleet, though hourly looked for, had not arrived in the bay; on the other, Washington, with the army from the north, though rapidly advancing, might be too late to prevent the escape of the enemy into North Carolina, if such was really the intention of Corn- wallis, as there was reason to believe was the case. In such an event the Marquis had not the means of crossing James river in pursuit; and it could be"oniy the ignorance of the enemy of that fact, which might seem to :justify them in remaining where they were, and abiding the issie against the superior forces ac- cumdlating around them.  ' Who will immortalize his riame by rendering his country a great service?" asked the Marquis, repeatedly.  "General," said Waples, "I am the most anxious man in the whole army to see the war at an end. I want to go home and get married. Can I perform the service you allude to?" "You might disguise yourself, I think, and personate a private. WThat do you say, General?" "It will not answer," said Wayne. "He has been a prisoner oncer and made his escape." "Well, if I am taken again, I Suppose they won't hang me as a violator of my parole, since I gave none," said Waples. "But if they recognise you as a spy, they will," said Wayne. "Oh, that is it, is it? That service would not be to my taste. I will go into their camp at the head of my men, but in no other way. I will go as their enemy, and fight them as such, if the General will permit me." s "Brave young man 1" said Fayette; " pardon me for proposing such a service to you% You have passed through dangers enough, and served your country long enough, to merit. the hand of your     296         THE MONARCHST. mistress. It would be cruel to hazard the loss of one who has deserved so much, and is looked for so anxiously at home, in such a perilous service. I require one who has not such ties, to enter the lines of the enemy as a deserter, and to mislead them by certain information he will impart. I merely wish him to declare that I have boats sufficient to cross the river James with the greatest expedition. Do you know any one who would answer my purpose?" "I know one, who, if he will undertake the service, will per- form it perfectly. It is private Morgan, of New Jersey." "You will do me a very great favour to bring him hither immediately.' Waples returned in a few minutes with Morgan. "Have you mentioned my desire to him?" asked the Marquis. "Yes, sir; but he objects to it, on one account only." "And that is not the fear of losing my life," said Morgan, who was a cool, discreet, and rather taciturn young man. "I will vouch for that," said Wayne. "I have seen him, just as calm as he is now, face the music more than once." "And I would do it again, General, just as freely as eating or sleeping. But my objection to this business is, if I should be found out and hung, it might disgrace me at home. My neigh- bours would never forget that Morgan was hung. I don't mind any other sort of death." "How shall they find out you are not a real deserter? They cannot find it out. You will not go into their camp to obtain any intelligence. All you will have to say, when examined by his Lordship, will be that I have boats enough to transport the army over, James river with the greatest ease and celerity. That is all. You may then come back to us the first opportunity, after the fifth day. My dear friend, let me prevail on you to undertake this mission. Depend upon it you shall be handsomely rewarded." /  As for reward, I don't mind that. All I fear is disgrace among my neighbours. But I'll go, if you make a solemn promise, that, provided I'm hung, a true account of the transac- tion shall be published in all the Jersey papers." "I promise!" said the Marquis, joyfully. "And I too," said Wayne. "And I'll be a witness," said Waples. "Recollect, the 'newspapers must say, I didn't desert in earnest, but because the General got me to make believe I did it, and that it was done to serve the country. And when I am hung as a spy, recollect the papers must tell my neighbours, that it was   TIIE MONARCHST.         297 a service I had no liking for, and that I never did such a thing before, and would not have thought of it this time, if it hadn't been for the particular request of the General. And make 'em say likewise, that the published account of my hanging, and all the explanations about it, was promised to be made before I undertook the business. Then you see my neighbours can't say anything disrespectful of me when I am dead. But if I live six days, I'll let you off, and save you all that trouble." In less than an hour Morgan was in the hands of the British. When taken into the presence of Cornwallis, the first question his Lordship asked was in relation to the boats. Without the slightest change of his serious countenance, he replied as he had been requested, and the British General believed him. It changed the purpose of his Lordship, and he resolved to stay where he was, and strengthen his defences. Before the expiration of the five days Count De Grasse had entered the Chesapeake, and Washington had arrived by land. On-the fifth day Waples was confronted by. Morgan, who had with him five real deserters from the enemy, besides one Hes- sian whom he had disarmed and taken prisoner. Waples led them to the tent of Lafayette, where Washington, and many other generals and noblemen, were met together. When informed of Morgan's good conduct, Washington ex- pressed much satisfaction. What did his Lordship say, and how did he look, when you told him I had so many boats?" asked the Marquis. "He said to Colonel Dundas-' that settles the matter-we must now resolve to remain where we are-' and he looked awful black, and sorry like." "You have rendered a very important service, sir," said Washington. "Thank you, thank you, General!" said the honest private; "I will never forget your words. I will write them down, and theni'my neighbours will say Morgan behaved like a man." "Stop a moment!" said Washingtoy and the Marquis together, seeing the private about to retire. "You must be enabled to exhibit a better testimonial of your merit than simply my words of commendation," continued Wash- ington. "Yours is a case which demands instant promotion, and other proofs of my regard." "Oh, never mind, your Excellency," said Morgan; '"I ain't fit to be an officer-I ain't qualified; and I won't accept." "Noble young man! most admirable sentiments!" exclaimed     298         THE MONARCHST. Lafayette, offering his purse. "At least you will receive this testimony of my private regard?" "No, I won't! Hang me if I do! What would my neighbours say? Why, they'd say he done it for gold! If anybody ever says so, it's a lie! And I want you, Captain Waples, to be my witness that I done it for the good of the country '" "Yes, I'll swear to it; and if any of your neighbours should doubt it, I'll make them swallow ten inches of my sword," said Waples. "But my dear friend," said the Marquis, moved almost to tears, " think if there is not something I can do for you, which will not disgrace you in the eyes of your neighbours." "Yes, there is one thing you might do for me, and it's all I ask." "Name it." "Why, when I was away, somebody stole my musket. If you can have that found and given back to me, I'll be happy, and thank you kindly. My name's on the stock. I cut it there with my knife." It was found and restored to him, and that was all the recom- pense Morgan would receive. Subsequently, when Lafayette mentioned the circumstance to Lord Cornwallis, the latter confessed that he had been completely deceived by the grave and earnest demeanour of Morgan. New recruits poured in from all sides, and Washington was almost embarrassed with the incessant applications of his country- men to be employed against the enemy. A rivalry had likewise sprung up between the American and French soldiers, each being emulous to participate in the most desperate assaults. More than a hundred of the eastern shore men, finding the bay commanded by the friendly fleet of Count de Grasse, sailed out of the creeks, and volunteered their services in the contest at Yorktown. Among these was Thomas Custis, for whom an exchange had been offered, and refused by the British, on the ground that he had given his parole unconditionally. He ventured all. No solicitations could restrain him. Cropper, Christian, Poulson; several of the Wises, the Parkers, the Bayleys, the Sa- vages, the Parsons, the Cables, the Smiths, the Yerbys, the Pitts', the Scarboroughs, the Joyneses, the Finneys, the Bagwells, the Strattons, the Fishers, and many others from the counties of Acco- mac and Northampton were there. And it was a joyful meeting between those who had been absent in the service for years, and their relatives and friends just arrived from home. Washington %   THE MONARCHST.         299 permitted them to serve together, and incorporated them tempo- rarily with the division under Lafayette's command. Never did men labour with a better will than the American soldiers in the approaches to the British fortifications. The first parallel was completed in an almost inconceivably brief space of time, and batteries were established which soon demolished the outworks of the enemy. It was quite apparent that Lord Corn- wallis's fate was sealed without the occurrence of some miraculous means of deliverance. Yet he maintained a firm countenance, and his batteries were well served. But the time had arrived for less formal operations than the firing of cannon and the systematic flight of bombs; and on the evening of the 14th October arrangements were mace to assault two of the enemy's batteries with fixed bayonets and uncharged guns. Major-General the Baron Viomenil led the FrenCh in the as- sault upon one redoubt, while Lafayette led the Americans against the other. Lieutenant-Colonel Alexander Hamiltoi, Washing- ton's aid-de-camp and secretary, took a prominent part in the attack on the redoubts. On they marched, under cover of the darkness of the evening; but that was no protection against the hailing grape-shot of the British. The fire from the redoubts began as soon as the advancing parties presented themselves within range of the guns. The aim was uncertain, it was true; but it was impossible, nevertheless, to avoid sending many an iron shower through the ranks of the approaching parties. Yet the enthusiastic Americans and Frenchmen did not abate their pace as their brave companions were mowed down. They pressed on, with their eyes fixed upon the instruments of deLth belching destruction in their midst. No danger, no resistance could check the survivors. At the time appointed, both of the assaulting parties, without firing a gun, had taken the batteries they had been directed against; and their advance under the fire of the enemy had been so rapid, that only about one hundred and fifty men had been killed and wounded. Two days after these successes, the British commander, not to be excelled in gallant enterprises, permitted Lieutenant-Colo- nel Abercrombie to make a bold sortie from the garrison. Two of the American batteries were forced, and eleven cannon spiked. In that assault, Thomas Custis was taken prisoner, and swept along with the British in their retreat back to the town. On the other hand, Waples, being among the last of the Americans to retire, and being mixed up with the enemy, seized the arm of     300         THE MONARCHST. Captain Montresor, his former captor, and dragged him along by main strength into the American lines. Custis was confined in the mansion of Governor Nelson, which had been hitherto spared by the American cannoneers. "Aha4! have we got you again?" said Colonel Tarleton, on the evening of the day of the sortie, when accidentally meeting with the young prisoner. "I am sorry for it; I felt a friendship for your sister." "It is the fate of war, and what we must all submit to when fortune is against us," said Custis. "I am fearful that you labour under a mistake as to the nature of your condition. You were released upon a promise not to serve again against your King." "Who is that?" asked Lord Cornwallis, who, like others, upon observing that Governor Nelson's house was spared, spent much of his time in it, and happened to be passing at the mo- ment. "The young officer who was discharged on his parole in Phi- ladelphia-Thomas Custis." "Indeed! I anm sorry for it! Why did you take up arms again, when you must have known what the consequences would be, if taken?" "An exchange was tendered Sir Henry Clinton," said Custis. "But it was not accepted." "Then I considered myself absolved." "( But you will not be considered so by us," said Tarleton. "The penalty is death." "We have no time, now, Colonel, to engage in this business," said Cornwallis. "You will proceed without delay to the boats, and forward the preparations for embarking your horses. The only hope for us now remaining is to escape by way of Glouces- ter Point, and a desperate retreat by land to New York." This last project was defeated by a thunder-storm. "I will save you if possible," said Cornwallis to the prisoner, when Tarleton withdrew. "Keep out of the way of the officers; go above, and conceal yourself in the garret. This house affords the best shelter from the infernal hot shot and shells of your friends." It was not known in the American camp that Custis was a prisoner. He was missed, however; and it was feared he had fallen. "Now we are even!" said Waples to his prisoner, as they par- took of an impromptu supper of oysters and crabs.   THE MONARCHST.         301 "Not quite," said Montresor; "I was not betrayed by a troop of geese." "No; but you were followed by a set of fools. What was the use of taking a few cannon, to be held just fifteen minutes, when each gun cost you a half-dozen men? You se% we have them back again, with the spikes withdrawn." "Oh, you know we never trouble ourselves to ask what use there may be in this or that operation. We never deliberate. But tell me why it is that your gunners never aim at the finest house we have in town?"  "It belongs to the Governor." "But you must know that in sparing it you suffer our officers to escape injury, as they will take shelter under its friendly roof. Pray remember I speak in confidence. You will not repeat my words?" "But they won't escape, though! Not one of them. We would rather take them alive than kill them. Your officers will be spared for the same reason that your men spared me. They were afraid to fire, thinking they might injure you."' , "And did that enter into your calculations when you seized my arm and ran away with me?"  "It did, upon my honour!" Montresor scanned with admiration the frank countenance of his blunt friend-his friend, though his captor. "But I supposed you had retired from the service," said Mon- tresor; "Master Robert, oy some one else told me you were to espouse the Miss Custis we had in Philadelphia." "And so I have been espousing her for the last five years, but you would not let me." "I would not let you?" "I mean your armies, and this vexatious war.' We were to have been married about the time Lord Dunmore began his out- rages on the people in this county. The accidents of the time put off the wedding. Then, when you marched against Phila- delphia through New Jersey) I marched to defend it, resolved to return home from the city with my bride. But, somehow or other, she had become jealous of the charms of the service which had drawn me away from her presence, and would not consent to it; indeed she would hardly speak to me for more than a year. When you approached the city from the head of Elk, I was in disgrace with my mistress, and of course I was disposed to fight ydu, as being the cause of my disappointment. I did fight, but you beat us. The city fell into your hands, and my mistress with it, and you know I could not marry her then. But she seemed 26     302         THE MONARCHST. to relent a little when I bid her farewell and left her to Tarle- ton's mercy. I fought you again at Germantown-" "And surrendered to a goose," interrupted Montresor. "You were my captor. Then my mistress was all my own; but I was in prison. There is nothing like a prison or a gallows to soften a woman's heart. The more you suffer, the more you are debased, the stronger is her love for you. Well, you know, I suppose, she got me out of that scrape. She liberated me at the risk of losing her own life. Then I determined to go home and be nmrried. I did go, and again the wedding-day was fixed. That infernal pirate, Philips, appeared in the bay, and after a hard fight, took Nannie's brother, and several others, my friends, prisoners. I could not help pursuing him in an armed schooner we manned for the purpose. When the prisoners were at liberty, I found myself on this side of the bay, and some twenty of your cruisers and ships between me and my mistress! I came to the conclusion there never would be a chance for me to marry, until the war itself was concluded. And from that day to this I have never ceased th perform my share of duty." "And now, I hope, the war is near its conclusion," said Mon- tresor, "for I am also anxious to see my home." "Have you a mistress? Does this confounded war keep you from marrying too?" "I will confess it does," said the Captain. "I must away, now!"' said Waples, hearing the signal for opening the great batteries which had been several days in prepa- ration for a simultaneous cannonade and bombardment. "But you have not given your parole. Just say you will not escape for five days, and you shall be your own master." "Very well; you have my word." When Waples reached the post which had been allotted him, Governor Nelson rode up and demanded to know why the enemy were not fired upon in the conspicuous mansion, then in view of the gunners. With his glass he could perceive the British offi- cers overlooking the field, and directing the defensive operations from the windows. "That is your house, Governor; and we have been ordered to spare it," said the subalterns about the battery. "Who the d-1 gave you such an order? No matter; obey my order, .and tear the house to atoms in the shortest space of time possible! Fire at it, I will watch you!" They seemed to do his bidding. "That won't do!" he exclaimed, on seeing some of the bricks fall from the chimney tops. You aim too high, and I believe   THE MONARCHST.         303 you do it purposely. Fire at the centre of the building. Don't spare it on my account. That's it! Good heavens! how the red coats are pouring out of it! Give it to them again. Aim there, a little to the 'left of the centre-hem! they're aiming, too!"At that instant a cannon ball had carried awFy the sword in the General's hand with which he had been pointing at the house. "Come down!" cried Cornwallis to Custis, when he perceived the Americans had ceased to spare the mansion, and before he abandoned it himself. "No, by Jupiter!" said Custis; "I would rather be killed in this way than to be hung, or to be shot by your men for a breach of parole." i"You shall not be injured. Come with us, or you will be slain to a certainty," continued his Lordship. "I would rather remain," persisted the young man; "I don't believe they will hit me. But they have slaughtered a bushel of rats."        '  "Rats! Foolish young man! Have your will, then!" I am comfortable, I thank you. I have a little hole here, through which I can see everything; and I enjoy the fun almost as much as if I were taking part in it. If you will believe me, though, the sooner you strike your colours and send out a white flag, the better it will be for you, and for his Majesty's army at present under your Lordship's command." Nor was it long before Custis had the satisfaction of seeing that his Lordship was of the same opinion. Master Robert Wales had arrived upon the scene in the last stages of the siege. At a glance he perceived the real condition of affairs, and knew what must be the inevitable result. He smiled when Washington ordered the opening of a hundred pieces of heavy ordnance upon the town, and remarked that his Excellency was about to discharge a swivel at a sparrow. He contended that the enemy would surrender in three days without the'effusion of blood. After the surrender, Montresor was exchanged for Custis, and all the eastern shoremen were permitted to return to their homes. They embarked in a large schooner, amid mutual congratulations, for they believed, as subsequent events proved, that the war was in effect at an end; and it was 'unanimously resolved that they would celebrate the recent victory on the Saturday following, at Drummondtown.     304         THE MONARCHST. CHAPTER XXX. Sheathe now the trusty blade, For the bloody strife is over; Go to the peaceful shade, Weary soldier, husband, lover. WHEN the schooner which was conveying the eastern shore men from the field of Yorktown to their homes, had proceeded about half way across the bay, a small fishing smack was over- taken, apparently beating up towards Maryland, against an ad- verse breeze. Upon being spoken to, the helmsman, who was the only individual in view, made no other response than to point to his ears, as if to indicate that he was deaf. "That don't satisfy me," said Waples, gazing steadfastly at the man, now not ten fathoms distant on the lee side of the schooner. "Bring them to, Captain Gibbs," he continued. "What the deuce do they carry a brush-heap for?" asked Custis. "We will soon see!" said Waples.  Be ready, men, with your arms! I believe that poor, deaf pilot is no other than the pirate Philips. He looks very much like him; and if so, that rubbish covers his crew." This announcement was sufficient to rouse every one. Such was the detestation in which that bucaneering leader and his out- laws were held, that no effort was necessary to stimulate the Vir- ginians to vigilance when a hope was held out that vengeance might at last be obtained. Still the pilot persisted, by his gestures, in the attempt to pass for a deaf man. But it did not avail him. The schooner ran alongside, and the men boarded the smack. "You have a cargo of dead men, have you?" asked Waples of the pilot, and at the same time pointing to the feet of several persons, visible under the bushes. The pilot, pale and agitated, forgetting that he had been acting the deaf man, now became merely dumb, for he shook his head in the negative.  "He can hear well enough, now," said one, "but he can't speak. Lift your hat, sir, and show us your face."   THE MONARCHST.         305 It was lifted for him, and, sure enough, it was the famous pirate and robber! It was in vain to affect a disguise any longer; and it was too late for resistance. He was bound, with his half-dozen men, and taken on board the schooner. Lord Cornwallis had refused to send him away with the tories on the Bonetta sloop-of-war, which one of the articles of capitu- lation had permitted to be used for the purpose of conveying the royalists to New York. He would not recognise him as belong- ing to the British service, and merely advised him to make his escape in the best manner he could, reminding him that as he had acted without orders, he had removed himself beyond the pale of his Majesty's protection. He was now to be tried for robbery and piracy before a judicial tribunal. At first, some who had suffered, directly or indirectly, from his freebooting operations, would have pursued a more sum- mary course; but they were overruled by the rest, who decided that it was best to place him in the hands of the civil power. When the schooner landed in the vicinity of Pungoteague, it was hailed by the population with shouts of irrepressible joy. It had approached with several flags displayed, with martial mu- sic, and at intervals with discharges from a small field-piece brought from. Yorktown as a trophy. Thus their arrival attracted the notice of a vast number of their relatives and friends; and the glad tidings they brought were soon spread over the land. As soon as horses could be obtained, and all within reach were tendered them, the soldiers, fresh from the glorious field of bat- tle, hastened to their homes to receive the congratulations and blessings of their families. At night bonfires illuminated the shores of the bay and of the ocean; for all believed that independence was achieved. It was true that no inconsiderable number of the old women, and some of the other sex, lamented with wringing hands and tearful eyes the loss of their King; but the vast majority of the young of both sexes, experienced a thrill of heart-felt delight under the suppo- sition that all the grievances which had been complained of were redressed, the final victory won, and peace and prosperity were henceforth to bless the country. "Now, Tom," said Waples to -Custis, as they drew near the old mill at the head of Deep Creek, "supposing we do not find the folks at home, what shall we do then? send for them, or follow after them ourselves?" "If they are not at home-if you allude to Nannie and my 26*                '      306         THE MONARCHST. wife-they are at Squire West's. We had better pass that way and see. They have an immense fire down there. Robinson and Poulson must have beaten us, or some one else has taken the news in advance of our arrival." "The whole country is in a blaze! Did you ever suppose there were so many pine-knots and patriots in 'old Accomac?" "Oh, they are glad the war is over on any terms. Shall we go through the Squire's gate?" "Yes, of course; it will not be out of the way; if the ones we seek be not there, perhaps we can get away. But why should our people be so weary of the war? They have not suffered so much." "But they have been deucedly frightened all the time." True, they had not suffered like the inhabitants of other sec- tions, and the cause of it was not to be attributed to the vigi- lance of the corps of volunteer guards. It remained an inexpli- cable mystery for a long time. But it was finally ascertained that it was owing to the representations of Master Robert and the two clergymen. They had made the British commanders believe that the population were mostly loyal, the principal fami- lies being descended from the Cavaliers who emigrated in the time of Cromwell. As was anticipated, the sister and wife of Custis were at the Squire's, conjecturing the young men would pass that way. Robinson Custis and Fanny, Poulson and Ann, Thomas Cus- tis's young wife and his sister Ann, the affianced of Waples, were seated in a circle round the old Squire, repeating the ex- citing incidents which had recently occurred. Mingled smiles and tears greeted the two young men who had been so often and so long absent in the service of their country; and a patriotic enthusiasm pervaded every heart. However, an enthusiasm of a different kind now filled the breast of Waples; and he contrived to whisper many things in the ear of Miss Custis, which were not heard by the company. But Ann's blushes did not escape detection. "What are you blushing about, sister?" asked her brother Thomas; " not, I hope, for Waples; no one need blush for him. He has performed his duty like a man, and deserves the smiles of every one. Ah! I see you are smiling, likewise; that's right."  "Boys!" said the Squire, "you must have a grand frolic; I see it; I feel it; it must be so. I'll do my part. But Saturday is a short notice. We must make the negroes ride all thii night,   THE MONARCHST.         307 and to-morrow night. Everybody must be there. And then the next day, Waples; what will you do the next day?" "The next day will be Sunday. On that day, I will be-" "Married? That's right! I desired all of them to wait for you. But no; they wouldn't do it; the impatient dogs! What is the matter there?" he continued, seeing Miss Custis turn away her face. "No more postponements, Nannie! The more you put him off, the more he'll fight the British! If you have any sympathy for the fallen enemy, marry him at once! Besides, the war is not quite over yet, as some of you seem to suppose. You cannot know that he will not be called away again before a week is past. My advice is to make sure of him while you may.) "Oh, shed has taken pity on the British," said Fanny, " and consented."  "What a pity she did not follow your example," said the Squire, "and consent before the war began! Why she would have saved a score of lives!" "And have been more merciful," added Fanny. But the British Lion was doomed from the first. It was the will of heaven, and was revealed to me," continued the Squire. "Indeed?" exclaimed several. "How?"  "It was typified in a figure. I will tell you." The Squire then repeated the occurrence of the eagle and the fish-hawk, much to the amusement of his young company. On the day appointed, the people, male and female, young and old, black and white, assembled at Drummondtown to celebrate the surrender of Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown. A barbecue was prepared, such as never had been witnessed in the county before. Speeches were made in the .court-house, before the ladies and the magistrates, who were mingled together on the benches. But no house there was capable of containing one- tenth part of the people. The taverns, the court-yard, the streets, were filled with the population; and all -seemed to be partakers of the happiness so universal throughout the entire continent. But in the midst of their joyous acclamations, they were startled by the appearance of a man among them, whose extra- ordinary conduct threatened to interrupt the festivity. This was Lewis'Craig, a tall pale man of a serious countenance, -with an expression of indescribable wildness in his eye. He had come over in the schooner from Yorktown, for what purpose none had -inquired. He was a Methodist preacher, and, the first that had ever been seen on the eastern shore.     308         THE MONARCHST. Standing upon the step in front of the court-house, Craig pulled out his Bible, took a text, and proceeded to preach an extempore sermon. Now the Rev. Mr. MacCoskie, who was present as a silent spectator, or who had merely pronounced a short benediction at the request of his parishioners, could not brook this innovation, although he was forced to submit to the political changes of the time. "Upon what authority do you act?" he asked of Craig. "By the authority of the King of kings, and the Lord of hosts," he replied; and resuming the subject of his discourse, he proceeded, in a most vociferous manner, to denounce the wickedness of the age in general, and the sins of the people of Accomac in particular. This was a most extraordinary proceeding in that place, where none but ministers of the established church had been hitherto heard; and the female portion of Mr. MacCoskie's congregation especially encouraged their pastor in his purpose to have the Methodist preacher put down. "If you have such authority as you name," said the reverend gentleman, "produce it. Let us inspect your credentials." "Here it is!" exclaimed Craig, holding up the Bible. This is my authority. Who will dispute its authenticity? I have the word of God, himself, to preach his gospel. I have been called to the work. Oh, sinful mortals! flee the wrath to come! The wicked shall depart into everlasting torment. There shall be weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth. Weep now, and pray, before it be too late. Before the descending of yonder sun, ye who are now rejoicing and feasting, may be called to an awful account. Remember Belshazzar's feast. I am the handwriting on the wall. I say, before the sun goes down this day, the world may be at an end, and the terrible day of judgment may be begun. Repent, for the kingdom of God is at hand-" "This is too much!" said one of the magistrates. "Sheriff," he continued, " take that crazy man away. He is frightening the Women." "You must stop this racket," said Mr. Sneed, placing his hand on the preacher's shoulder. "Racket! and what will be the rolling of thunders in the heavens, and the flashing of lightning, and the mighty shout. when the, Son of Man shall appear in his glory, and all of which may take place before the setting of yonder sun?" ( Will you stop, sir?" No!" shouted the indignant man; "I will not cease to cry aloud, until--"   THE MONARCHST.          809 We'll see about that!" said the' sheriff, interrupting him, and leading him across the street, by the arm, towards the jail. A crowd followed; some of them verily believing the man was inspired, and that the things he predicted were about to trans- pire. "Now, if you will promise to keep quiet the rest of the day," said the sheriff, when he had conducted Craig to the door of the prison, "I will let you go." "I must do my Master's bidding-cry aloud and spare not." "Then so must I!" said Mr. Sneed. "The justices are my masters, and they have commanded me to imprison you if you will not cease your ranting." "I love prisons! I have been in twen'ty of them! I will have the greater share of glory, the more I am persecuted." The door was unlocked, and Craig was confined in the debtor's room, facing the street. But hardly had the people resumed their rejoicings before the. voice of the preacher was heard in a louder strain than ever. Ie was preaching through the grated windows to a mixed multi- tude below. Nothing could stop him; and the only remedy was to have a drum beaten under his window every time he launched into one of his most violent keys. Guns were fired, and much wine and rum swallowed in com- memoration of the great victory. Then followed the dance, which was prolonged till a late hour. On the day following, Mr, MacCoskie preached a remarkable sermon. He confessed that he had believed, and could not yet divest himself of the opinion, that no act of the British"ministry would be sufficient justification for throwing off all allegiance to the crown. He hoped still that a reconciliation would take place. But that was altogether in the hands of the rulers of the re- spective countries, whose conduct would be guided, he doubted not, by the inspirations of a wise and beneficent Providence. He remarked, however, in his digression from the subject of his text, that whatever might be the result, it. should not, and would not, he believed, affect, in the slightest manner, the allegiance of his beloved flock to the great King of heaven and earth. And he stated, that whatever might be the course of others in the ministry, it was his determination to remain with his parishioners under any circumstances. After the sermon, the reverend gentleman descended to the chancel, and, standing silently in the centre, in full view of the congregation, seemed to await some preconcerted movement on the part of a portion of his parishioners. He did not wait long.     310         THE MONARCHST. Several persons, old and young, arose, and, preceded by Samuel Waples and Ann Custis, approached the minister. The marriage ceremony was performed at last, in the presence -of hundreds of witnesses, and in defiance of all the armies of George III. The day following (Monday), being court-day, Captain Philips and his accomplices were put upon their trial. They had the benefit of good counsel, which was assigned them by the court; but were, nevertheless, found guilty, and shortly after they were executed.   THE MONARCHST.          3" CHAPTER XXXI. The sword may cease its strife, Nations no more contend; Yet peace is not for mortal life, Nor mortal for a friend! QUEEN ELIZABETH. THE Revolution had been accomplished. Washington was the President of the United States. Jefferson and Hamilton, al- though still antagonistical in their principles and aspirations, were associated in the Cabiiet. Master Robert, never for a mo- ment abandoning the idea that monarchical governments must ultimately prevail in civilized nations, had visited Mr. Jefferson in France, the year preceding his return, and there, too, sought in vain to arrest the progress of the demon-as he termed it- Democrity. Upon returning to America, he resumed his old employimnt; he was again the amanuensis of Mr. Jefferson. "Another republic!" exclaimed Master Robert, perusing some despatches from France, placed in his hands by the then Secre- tary of State. Mr. Jefferson seemed to enjoy the agitation of his secretary, and sat a small distance apart, observing him. "What is that, Master Robert?" he asked. "Oh, nothing, I suppose, but glad tidings for you; or rather a thing which was to transpire, as a matter of course, since you seem to have perused the intelligence without emotion or com- ment." "Years ago I predicted it; have you forgotten?" "No, sir; but I did not suppose you were really gifted with such powers." "But what do you suppose now?" "I suppose the whole drama will be enacted-and that the bloodiest scenes which ever afflicted the earth are about to tran- spire. And America, as you predicted, must be a participator in ,them!" "I never predicted that." "But you must advocate it." "That may be; but it does not follow that my advice will be taken. And the fact is, by our treaty of defensive alliance     812         THE MONARCHST. with France, we are bound in honour to take part against her enemies, as well as in gratitude for the services she rendered us." "And you will express that opinion in the council?" "I have done so; and it would not offend me if the opinions I expressed there were known to the country." "And Washington differed-" "Of course he did. Did I not predict it ten years ago?" "But Hamilton?" "He and Knox are both against me, antd concur with the President that, whatever may be the force of treaties, or the ob- ligations of gratitude, POLICY imposes on us the absolute neces- sity of remaining neutral! Randolph, however, was on my side." "Suppose your opinion prevailed; what then would be the consequences?" "But such a thing is not to be supposed. I see the result of this policy. It will complete the organization of the great Re- publican party, and rouse them against the Federalists! The aristocrats and consolidationists will be swept away." "And yet we have seen you unite with Mr. Hamilton in urging Washington to serve a second term. He ayows himself to be a federalist, in contradistinction to the states-right party." "He does not to the full extent of some of his friends," said Mr. Jefferson. "But even if he did, it would only prove him to be in error, as he has been before, in more instances than one. Yet, he could, at this time, advocate error itself with success. The French batteries must first play upon his popularity, before we plain republicans can erect our standard of opposition. Then the true principles of the government will be vindicated, and our party remain in the ascendant for ever." "You mean the usual eternity of parties in a republic; that is, until some caprice of the people shall create a new party more popular still." "No; principles never change. If the people in pursuit of novelty depart for a time from the right path, their inevitable miseries in the mazes of error will drive them back again. I am called an apostle of liberty. My epistles, when I am gone from among the living, will be preserved, and they may contri- bute to preserve the republic." "But will not Washington's words and letters be preserved also? And when they conflict with your doctrines, which will be most likely to prevail?" "Washington will never be quoted on great constitutional questions, or the principles of the rights of man. He will bVe *   THE MONAARCHLIST.        313 quoted as a patriot, but not as a statesman. He has the qualifi- cations to execute a law, but not to frame one. He may even discuss the ordinary principles of government and elucidate them; but he can never evolve them from the chaos of conflict- ing interests. Still he is a great and good man. For, while ho is not supereminently brilliant in any of the attributes of genius, he is never below mediocrity. His mind is well balanced. He would make a good judge, general, or king. Thus I do him justice, while I confess my own utter want of qualifications to be a military commander." "Would he were king!" said Wales. "Were he not Washington, whose fame' will be greater than that of kings, it is probable he would be. He pight be, easily, by consenting to be re-elected indefinitely, until the patronage at his disposal gave him the command of Congress, and of the legislatures of the states." "In despite of the French batteries?" Ay, in despite of anything. We did not open our batte- ries with any expectation of defeating his election, but that of his successor, whose policy will be the same. The Vice-Presi- dent is Washington's heir apparent; upon him we will pour out the vials of destruction. He may succeed at first; but a few years after Washington has retired completely from the field, then the federalists will be scattered like chaff upon the wind." "If I have studied Washington's character correctly," said Wales, he will never cease to exert his influence in behalf of the measures and men he advocates, while he lives; and if he be thwarted too much, and should suppose his interposition necessary to save the country from disaster, I think he will re- main permanently at the helm. He never can cease to take a deep interest in public affairs. Remember, he is not very old yet; and I have recently seen him mount his horse as vigor- ously as he did fifteen years ago." But I venture to say he mounted with a sigh-a sigh for Mount Vernon. Half his thoughts, and all his hopes of worldly pleasure, are concentred the T Why. he has written to England for a newly invented engine to pull up trees by the roots!" "Is that not an absurdity?" "According to my philosophy." "And you said he never sank below mediocrity." "Nor does he in his own performances. But he is excessively credulous in matters of science of which he has no great knowledge. Why it is an undeniable fact, that when his head- quarters were in the highlands of New York, and he was devis- 27     314         THE MONARCHST. ing means for the transportation of stores, he expended a vast deal of money upon the experiments of a knave, who professed to have invented a plan of causing boats to propel themselves up stream. He even exhibited a model, on a small scale, and his explanations seemed plausible. It was upon the principle by which other machinery is put in motion by water. tThe boats were to have side-wheels. The stronger the current the faster the wheels would turn round, and of course the greater the velocity of the boat. He had the impudence to declare to Washington (and Washington listened with gravity), that his boats would run up a very strong current some nine miles an hour; up a moderate one some five or six; but that the speed would be much less down stream. In still water, he admitted that the boats would not run at all!" "Can it be possible?" "Undoubtedly. I have seen several letters written by him on the subject, which evince his interest, if they do not quite prove his faith in the efficacy of the plan. His great foible is his credulity, and Hamilton is aware of it, and uses it, I think. I attribute many things which I disapprove in the President's conduct to Hamilton. No doubt he persuaded him it was proper in the chief magistrate to adopt almost the same formalities which are observed in kingly courts. His audiences are upon the monarchical plan. The row is formed, as you saw it in France, and he passes along addressing a'few words to each, and then dismisses them with a bow! And he is decked in satins, laces, and diamonds! And what an establishment he keeps up! Never was there a greater absurdity than the formal declaration that he would not receive any salary as President--but merely whatwould be necessary to defray his family expenses! Will the people believe, fifty years hence, that the'expenses of his family (and without children, mind you), never failed to amount to twenty-five thousand dollars per annum? But so it is; and the records of the Treasury, under Colonel Hamilton's adminis- tration, must ever afford the evidence of it. Now, when we simple republicans get possession of the government, we will change all that." "Will you not draw the salary?" "I do not mean that. But we will dispense with the regal ceremony, the satin breeches, laced cuffs, and diamond buckles. Neither will we tolerate footmen in livery, or gaudy coats of arms on our carriages. Future generations will be reluctant to believe that Washington indulged such anti-republican fancies." "I hope not," said Wales; "and I trust they will consider   THE MONARCHST.         315 them worthy of imitation. You will not be offended at the frank-rowal I make. You have both tolerated and encouraged the expression of opinions and sentiments different from your own.', "You know my motto: error ceases to be dangerous when truth is left free to combat it. I shall make a convert of you yet, in return for the many valuable services your pen and me- mory have rendered me." "If such a thing were possible, of course I should be casuist enough to submit and thank you." Master Robert, upon making the dispositions of the despatches which had been requested by the Secretary of State, withdrew from the office; and at the hour appointed for such interviews, and which had been specified by Washington himself (for he was greatly annoyed by innumerable applications for private audi- ences), he waited upon the President. He was always received with pleasure by every one with whom he was in the habits of intimacy. He continued ta be useful to all with whom he came in contact; and the confidence of no one had ever been betrayed by him; or if so, it had never been discovered. Wherever he might be, he did not hesitate to avow his preference of a monar- chy; and never lost an opportunity to demonstrate the advantages of his favourite form of government. If he could not convince, he never failed to instruct or amuse. "You are welcome, Master Robert," said Washington, extend- ing his hand in a friendly manner; but there were traces of mental distress upon his serious brow. "I fear your Excellency's health is not so good as might be desired. I am sorry to find you so pale. If it be at all incon- venient for you to grant me a short interview, I will retire at once, and come again when your Excellency's health is quite re-established." "No, no; remain; your conversation may divert my thoughts into some new channel, which will be a relief to me. The health of my body is as good as usual; my constitution should wear well full twenty years yet. But my mind has been agitated. I have been the subject of bitter vituperation in the gazettes, and have found determined opposition to my policy. All this you are acquainted with; and I confess it vexes me, and preys upon my spirits too much to admit of serenity of mind." "I foresaw it, and feared it. It is the product and conse. quence of factions; and the factions are fostered by the govern. ment, or at least by its contemplated operation. You might annihilate them, and still act within the provisions of the Con- \     316         THE. MONARCHST. stitution. And such, I know, is the opinion and the hope of the Secretary of the Treasury." "Colonel Hamilton is a too partial friend of mine; and. per- haps too much prejudiced against Mr. Jefferson. But what is it you propose?" "A permanency of tenure in the chief executive. You have only to consent to it, and you will be re-elected every four years during your life. Your example will become a precedent. Then factions will cease, or only spring into activity once in a life- time, or rather upon the occasion of the death of the Presidential incumbent. If you retire at the end of a second term, all your successors must do the same; and the country will ever be the prey of factions." "No more of that! My resolution, formed so many years ago, has become a portion of my nature, and cannot be eradi- cated. My farm is my Mecca, and never will I turn my face away from it." "When you embarked in the cause of the colonies, it was a relinquishment of private happiness. At the end of the war, your repose was merely like the brief resting of a bird of pas- sage. Your country claimed your services; as the property of the state, and the whole world acknowledged its title. In truth, there could have been no Constitution adopted, but for your influence, and all your previous exertions and sacrifices would have been in vain. The government formed, no one could have put it in operation and preserved it from destruction but your. self. Hence, you could not avoid the necessity of presiding at the helm. At the expiration of four years, you purposed, at length, to make a final abandonment of public employments. In anticipation of that event, the enemies of the federal system had made their preparations for its subversion, and it was found to be indispensably necessary for you to remain at the helm four years longer. Again the leaders of the factions are anticipating the time when the helm will fall into their hands, and when they may repeal your laws, reverse your foreign policy, and exalt the reserved rights of the states above the powers of the federal go- vernment. You may retire; but you can never look with equa- nimity upon the havoc made by your political opponents. You will not be happy at Mount Vernon, or anywhere else, while the affairs of state are conducted in a contrary manner to your set- tled convictions of policy. They will be so conducted if you relinquish the helm; and so will your peace of, mind be de- stroyed. Then since such must be the case, why not continue, where you are, the chief magistrate for life? Soon the seat of go-   THE MONARCHST.         317 vernment will be established within sight of your mansion, on the banks of the Potomac; you can enjoy the pleasures and benefits of agricultural pursuits, quite as much while conducting the government properly, as you could, when deprived of power, while others conducted improperly." "Cease, Master Robert, your arguments and persuasions. My mind is irrevocably fixed." "I am sorry for it! Far better, then, had it been, if you had adhered to your first resolution, and divested yourself of public employments for ever at the end of the war!" "It would have been better for myself, I believe!" "Undoubtedly. Then, whatever form the government might have assumed, no one could have vented the breath of detraction- no one could have assailed your motives." "Their assaults shall not deter me, Master Robert, from the discharge of my. duty. The treaty of alliance was made with the King of France. He has been slain by his enemies, and the horrible butchers claiming to be the government, insist on America becoming accessories after the fact; and would have us participate with them in other sanguinary transactions!" "I rejoice to hear such sentiments! But they will not pre- vail if others are left to uphold them." "If we maintain our neutral position a little while longer, the danger wilt be over. The factions may destroy my popularity, but I will save the country from destruction." "Yes, sir; you will save it in the present crisis; but such dangers will arise continually, and when others occupy the posi- tion you now hold, perhaps they may not be so willing to sacri- fice themselves for the salvation of the country." "Providence will guide them. They will be desirous of leav- ing honourable names behind. To do this the country must be preserved from ruin by them. The most ambitious aspirants will, I think, when they have attained their ends, cease to be swayed by selfish considerations, and exert all their faculties in, behalf of the country." "I fear there will be among your successors those who, find- ing it impossible to prolong the period of their service beyond the limits which you have prescribed, will proclaim such princi- ples, and organize such parties to uphold them, as will in effect make them the so-called patriarchs of republicanism, to the neglect and detriment of your fame. If men are sometimes thrust aside, parties cannot be; and mere party-names may have more influence, at no distant period, than the opinions of the most exalted characters." 27      318         THE MONARCHST. CHAPTER XXXII. And must the sacrifice Made by the great and good, Reap no reward on earth B\ut base ingratitude? THE NUN. MASTER ROBERT (after the lapse of several years), again pre- sented himself before Washington. It was at Mount Vernon. Mr. Adams was the President, and Mr. Jefferson, now the Vice- President, was biding his time, confident that the reins would fall into his hands. But the great Chief, as had been predicted by Hamilton, Wales, and a great many others, was not suffered to divest his mind of public cares. Mr. Adams, whose elevation he had ad- vocated, without communicating with him on the subject, or at least before receiving his concurrence, had sent to the Senate his nomination as Lieutenant-General, and Commander-in-chief of all the armies of America. It was supposed the country was upon the eve of a war with France. Washington had accepted the appointment upon certain con- ditions-conditions which had not been subsequently complied with on the part of the President and others; and he was a prey to chagrin and disappointment when Wales presented himself. "My dear friend," said Washington, after leading Master Robert by the hand to a seat in 'the library, "your predictions have been verified as regards myself; your arguments were always convincing, and were rather opposed by my inclination than my reason. I have now nearly completed my sixty-eighth year, and you find me again burdened with public cares. And that is not all. My recommendations for appointments of subor- dinates are disregarded; my propositions for the immediate and effectual organization of the army; rejected or passed over in silence; and, in short, my communications of plans, and solicita- tions for information, seem to be regarded by the administration as downright vexations, pertinaciously thrust upon the exalted per- sonages who are in the exercise of the functions of government." "That is most astonishing!" said Wales. "I never supposed there could be the semblance of ingratitude on the part of those who owe everything to you. The Secretary of War---"   T E AMONARCHST.         319 "Is my friend; and it is from him, and through him, I learn what is my insignificance in the estimation of the great public characters. The most mortifying thing of all, is the apparent studied design to keep me in utter ignorance of the nature, pro- gress, and probable result of the negotiations. I am kept in the dark, as one unfit to be trusted! I, who knew the substance of every despatch in the archives, from the beginning up to the mo- ment of my departure from the seat of government! I am em- powered by Congress, and it is my duty, to forward every species of preparation requisite for a state of war with one of the first nations of the world; and yet I am hindered, opposed, thwarted by the Executive, which should afford every facility in the exe- cution of the laws! If there is a probability that war will be averted by the interposition of diplomacy, why do they not say so? It must be that they do not choose to permit me to share with them the secrets of the government!" "' You, who freed the nation, and then contributed most to frame the government!" "Yes, sir! and these very men are indebted to me for the positions they hold! It is base ingratitude!" said Washington, with unusual warmth, rising and pacing to and fro with unwonted vigour and activity. "The way to prevent a war," he continued, "is to be prepared for it. But how can I prepare for it without the co-operation of government? Suppose France were to send a fleet and army upon us suddenly, what would be the con- sequences? At no point could we resist them. And it would be the signal for another invasion from England. Thus would va- nish all the fruits of a seven years' war! We would have fought and laboured in vain ." "Your successor may succeed in avoiding a war on. either ;thand; but it can never be denied' that he perilled everything upon : single cast of the die:" "Iie will be defeated at the next election, doubtless; but then, who is to succeed him? The head of the anti-federal party, the champion of the French alliance, and avowedly my enemy  Miserable prospect Whither would this French alliance lead us? Into a thousand battle-fields on the plains of Europe, per- haps; an eternal war between Democracy and Monarchies! We want only peace. Prosperity will then ensue." "Pardon me, sir, for supposing that the conflict would not be eternal; I think it would be too unequal to be of long duration." "But its baneful effects would be eternal. Could not Mr. Jefferson's faction exist without embarking in this Quixotical crusale against the principle upon which kingly governments are based? Nothing for policy, everything for principle, is the cry .'     820         THE MONARCHST. "One way remains to save America," said Wales, quickly "if you would only become a candidate to succeed Mr. Adams, the factions would be instantly disbanded, and the country and the world would turn their eyes with a sense of security on their preserver, and posterity would applaud the act. Your own happi- ness would be secured, and your enemies justly rebuked." If I were a few years younger, Master Robert!" said Wash- ington, folding his arms on his breast, and standing as perfectly erect as when he was first appointed Commander-in-chief at the age of forty-three. "You are as vigorous as ever. Scipio told me you mounted your tall steed this morning, with as much ease as ever you did in your life. You feel, you know, that your life has been offered upon the altar of your country; not one particle of it is at your own disposal, if it detracts from the general good. In retirement you cease to be happy, and your country ceases to prosper. And shall the mere liability to be charged with a want of consistency -of an unconditional adherence to a resolution expressed, con- cerning. exclusively your private interest-deter one from resum- ing a position which the whole world unites in believing no other ma, should occupy?" "Master Robert, tempt me no further. I confess I am too much disposed to follow your counsel; and it is the counsel of others of mature judgment and vast influence. But no conside. ration would induce me to seem to thrust myself forward. I have been much condemned by the press; and it might be that a majority of the people would prefer some one else. I admit that I would be willing to sacrifice the few remaining years of my life for the benefit of my country, if such a sacrifice were indis- pensably necessary, and seemed palpably so to all. It is true I feel as yet no diminution of my strength of body, or vigour of mind. I am not very old, and a good many years may possibly be yet vouchsafed me. God alone knows. It is quite certain that I do not find the happiness I hoped for in retirement; nor do the prospects of the country afford any cheering indications. Yet I will not permit any intimation to transpire of a purpose which may never be entertained. The cloud may blow over, and the close of my day be illuminated by a glorious sunshine. To enjoy it I must be in retirement, under my own vine and fig-tree. You say you are passing to Philadelphia. I will write to Mr. McHenry and General Hamilton by you." They were the last letters he ever wrote. In forty-eight hours after they were written he was a corpse!   THE MONARCIIIST.         321 CHAPT    SXXXIII. Labour, suffer, hope, and plan, Dust to dust, impotent man! SONG OF DEATH. WITH the death of Washington, expired the hopes of the Monarchist in America. Master Robert saw at once that no human interference could prevent the ascendancy of Mr. Jeffer- son, and the establishment of his principles, so fatally opposed to monarchical institutions. He therefore determined to abandon the country for ever, or until such period as accident or design might produce a change in the sentiments of the people. He therefore sailed again for Europe, and landing in England, paused merely long enough to have an interview with some of the partisans of the Bourbons in London, with whom he had  been long in correspondence, and then proceeded rapidly to Paris. Accident had made him acquainted with Napoleon Bonaparte when he was a mere subordinate officer; and if he was struck with the extraordinary comprehensiveness of the mind of the young soldier, the dazzling brilliancy of his ideas, and the rest- less energy inseparable from genius of the highest order, neither was the possessor of such qualities of intellect unobservant of the characteristics of one who never failed to declare his settled conviction that a monarchy was not only the system of govern- ment designed by the Creator for man, but the only form under which civilized nations could be prosperous and happy. As if already impressed with a presentiment of the high destiny await- ing him, Napoleon at once sought to cultivate the acquaintance of the diminutive stranger. And when Wales returned to Ame- rica, previous to the inauguration of the first President, a regular correspondence had been established between them. If Wales had expressed to Napoleon, and that too in Paris, and not long before the beginning of the Reign of Terror, his desire that the Bourbons might be restored to the throne of their ancestors, it may be supposed that he was in communication with those princes themselves, and that he was privy to all the plans of their agents in the work of restoration.     322         THE MONARCHST. He was the first to bear the sad tidings of the death of Wash- ington to France. Napoleon was in Paris, now fixed- upon the Consular throne, and in the possession of more than regal power. He was, indeed, then making arrangements to take up his abode in the royal apartments of the Tuileries, and to establish a court even while the name of Republic yet existed. "' Welcome, my little diplomatist!" said Napoleon, presenting Master Robert to Josephine. "They call me the little corporal. It is to be seen what wonders the little diplomatist will accom- plish. Tell me how the great Washington enjoys his self-imposed retirement. Is he happy?" "Ah, sir, it is a sad theme. Happy? Oh yes, if the good are happy in heaven. Washington is dead!" "Dead!" exclaimed both Napoleon and Josephine, in asto- nishment. "It is too true. I brought despatches to the American Com- missioners containing the official announcement, which will be communicated to your Highness to-morrow." "Dead! Washington dead!" continued Napoleon, abstractedly. "He has a great name throughout the world; but why did he not enjoy his power? So much the worse for him, and perhaps for his country. He is admired though by millions in France, notwithstanding my imbecile predecessors had almost declared war against his country. Let me reflect!"He walked to the opposite end of the room, and stood gazing out of the window. "The First Consul," said Josephine, "has always condemned Washington for not making himself king. If he might have done so, why did he not wear a crown?" "Ah, madame," replied Wales, unable to resist an opportu- nity of striking a blow in favour of the royal family in exile; for he was not yet convinced that the French people would not again tolerate the Bourbons, "it might have been easily accom- plished, and perhaps it would have been, if he had had children to succeed him." "He, too, was childless, then!" said Josephine, while the blood fled from her cheeks. "Yes, madame," continued Wales, pretending not to observe her emotion; " but his love for his wife was so pure and ineradi- cable, that, rather than relinquish her, he determined to decline a throne." "Admirable man! May God reward him with a crown of glory." "Master Robert," said Napoleon, returning, " although you are an Englishman, you are familiar with our language. Will   THE MONARCHST.         323 you accept employment from me? I am rich. I have restored the credit of the nation. The bankers can penetrate the future. Will you be one of my secretaries?" "With pleasure and gratitude; provided, on proper occasions, I may frankly express my inextinguishable convictions in favour of the monarchical form of government." "Very good, my little diplomatist. I think I shall not cut off your head for that. Take your pen, then. I will dictate an order of the day to the army." Wales then wrote what was dictated, as follows: "Washington is dead! That great man has struggled with tyranny; he consolidated the liberty of his country. His memory will be ever dear to the French people, as to all freemen in both hemispheres, who, like him and the American soldiers, have fought for liberty and equality. As a mark of respect, the First Consul orders that for ten days black crape shall be sus- pended from all the standards and banners of the republic." It had the desired effect, and contributed to the lustre of Na- poleon's ascending star. Magnanimity and patriotism were added to his other illustrious qualities. The very next day, and in the presence of Talleyrand and Fouch6, the First Consul held a long conference with Wales on the subject of American affairs. "You are quite certain," asked Bonaparte, "that a deep- rooted antipathy to the British has been implanted in the breasts of the Americans?" "-Quite certain, your Highness." "The First Consul is denominated Citizen, in France, Master Robert," said Fouch6. "No matter; he is anti-Jacobin," said Napoleon, with one of his sarcastic glances, before which Fouch6's smile vanished in an instant. Fouch6 had not yet relinquished the support he derived from the remains of the Democratic partisans of the Revolution. "And that there is still a partiality for the French alliance?" asked Talleyrand. "Undoubtedly. The party well-affected to France will soon be in the ascendant; and Mr. Jefferson, its leader and founder, will be the-next President." "Enough!" said Napoleon. "The Directory were mere babes in policy. They would have ruined France. But I will remedy their blunders. War with America! For what end'? Is not the European continent and Egypt a theatre large enough? Talleyrand, see to it! We must have peace-with America. We     324        THE MONARCHST. shall not want men or money from thence, but timber, and the use of their ports. We must foment war between England and America. England rules the ocean, and American commerce must pay her tribute, or war ensue. America may be useful to us in furnishing ships, or provisions for the army. The stupid Directory! Master Robert, my little diplomatist, go to the American commissioners. Say that Citizen Talleyrand is pre- pared to negotiate a treaty of amity and mutual benefit. Tal- leyrand, lose no time in arranging the articles. There is indem- nity claimed for the past spoliations; admit the justice of the claim; but postpone a settlement of the details to some future period. We may not be able to hold some of our American acquisitions, and instead of having them seized by the British, we may sell them to the Americans. Peace with England is out of the question." Master Robert, after leaving the Luxembourg, directed his course towards the Tuileries, where preparations were being made for the removal thither of the court. Hie was struck, upon entering the palace, at the evidences of Napoleon's profound dis- simulation in the selection and arrangements of the statues in the great gallery. He beheld Demosthenes and Alexander, Brutus and Caesar; among the moderns, Gustavus Adolphus, Turenne, Conde, Prince Eugene, Marlborough, Marshal Saxc Frederick, Washington, Dugommier, Dpmpierre, and Joubert. What a variety of specimens," exclaimed Wales, "from which to select a model! It will be, I. suppose, from among the an- cients. And he can be neither Brutus nor Demosthenes." It may be supposed that the little diplomatist received due consideration when he arrived at the hotel of the American commissioners. The substance of his proposition was found to be altogether included within the limits of their ultimatum, and no single impediment remained to retard negotiations. Master Robert, upon leaving the hotel, entered a cabriolet and was driven to a gloomy and ancient house in the Rue St. Nicaise. Exhibiting a card at the lodge, he was conducted by a poor girl of fifteen to the fifth story: who, merely indicating by her finger the door of the person he was in quest of, hastened to return. Wales, after waiting until his guide had descended several eta- ges, knocked distinctly four times, and the door was opened. He was admitted by the celebrated Monsieur Georges himself. "Ah, Monsieur Wales, you take my breath! You astonish me! I thought it must be M. Carbon." "Carbon!" iterated Wales. "Yes, I have understood that Carbon, St. Rejant, and Limoelan are all in Paris."   THE MONARCHST.         325 "And pray, Monsieur, how did you learn this?" exclaimed Georges, pale, and evincing, other symptoms of alarm. "Not in Paris, Monsieur; but in London." "Oh, you have just returned to Europe, and landed first in England! That explains everything." "So far as my appearance here, and knowledge of the presence of yourself and confederates are concerned; but not the purpose for which you came to Paris." - We are here, as formerly, in the service of his Majesty." "That I doubt not. But by what means do you propose to accomplish anything?" "There is an oath-a solemn oath, has been taken, Monsieur Wales, that the enterprise we are now engaged in shall not be revealed to any one not fully compromised by being engaged in it." "Indeed! And am I not recognised as being fully committed to the cause of the Bourbons?" "Yes. But you do not sanction the means we have adopted to facilitate a restoration." "I would not sanction an unpardonable crime, that good may come- of it. I would not have our enemies assassinated. But no results would follow a murder. The people of France must be induced to receive their rightful prince with cordiality, else there can be no restoration. The assassination of Bonaparte, and of all the-public functionaries, would rather infuriate the people against the royal cause, than induce them to submit to the re- storation of the exiled family. The Jacobins would, alone, be benefited." The Jacobins are overthrown for ever!" "And who did it?- Napoleon. He has accomplished more for the overthrow of the enemies of his Majesty than any man- than all men-living. And yet you would assassinate him, and before the work of regeneration is completed!" "How do you know that, Monsieur Wales? I have avowed no such thing." "True. And I trust in God such is not your purpose. But where are Carbon, St. REjant, and Limolan?- I want to see them and converse with them. We have corresponded, but have never met. I desire to know them when I see them. They have said they frequently passed me on the Boulevards in the Days of Terror. They recognise me; I must know them." "They could not avoid recognising Monsieur Wales" replied Georges, smiling. "And I too must know them when we meet. Will you in- troduce me?" 28     326        THE MONARCHST. "Pardon me, Monsieur; but the affair we are engaged in will prevent it for some time to come." "Adieu, then, Monsieur Georges. You know that I will not betray you." "You dare not. You know what would be the consequence." "The consequence to my person would not deter me, although I am aware that death would ensue. My honour would. But this I may say for your information, supposing, as I must, that no great crime is in contemplation, that M. Fouche is watching the royalists." "And the First Consul the Jacobins. Then let them watch each other! Adieu, Monsieur Wales." Master Robert was chagrined to find himself excluded from the councils of the royalist conspirators. For many weeks- he fruitlessly strove to identify the persons of Carbon, St. Rejant, and Limoelan, and he at last engaged lodgings in the vicinity of Georges for that purpose. For some time he had observed three men, but never together, in the Rue St. Nicaise, apparently measuring the distance to the Carrousel; and each of them in turn had repeatedly held in his hand a watch, as if to ascertain the exact time it required for a carriage to pass, at a brisk pace, from the moment it came in view. He did not mention what he had observed to Georges, whom he visited frequently, in the hope of meeting with the three secret agents of the Bourbons. He failed, however, to encounter the conspirators, for Georges had taken measures to prevent it. They came to him only at such hours, and under such precau- tions, as rendered the efforts of rWales ineffectual. Wales became at length impressed with the belief that a terri. ble blow was to be aimed at the First Consul, for he was in the habit of passing through the Rue St. Nicaise frequently. He could not approve of such a crime, and he determined to de- feat it. "Your Highness," said Wales one day, just after Napoleon had completed a vast amount of important business, and had thrown himself down on a couch in his closet, "must beware of the royalist fanatics as well as the Jacobins. They suppose if you were put out of existence, the only impediment in the way of Louis XVIII. would be removed." "I fear them not. Fools! Even if the army were annihilated, and the members of the government were bribed to overthrow the Republic, the Bourbons could not be restored. It is a de- funct dynasty. If it were otherwise, my power would end in a week. That my power increases, is the evidence of the rapid decline and speedy extinction of the adherents of Louis. Were   THE MONARCHST.         327 it not thus-if indeed I were the only impediment in his way- my death would not be necessary. I would obviate the necessity of a murder. Read that!" he continued, taking a letter from a secret dra'wer within his reach. Wales read as follows: "For long, General, you must have known the esteem in which I hold you. If you doubt my gratitude, fix upon the place you desire for yourself; point out the- situations which you wish for your friends. As to my principles, they are those of the French character. Clemency on principle accords with the dictates of reason. "No-the victor of Lodi, Castiglione, and Arcola; the conqueror of Italy and Egypt; can never prefer a vain celebrity to true glory. But you are losing the most precious moments. We could secure the happiness of France. I say we, for I require Bonaparte for such an attempt, and he could not achieve it with- out me. General, Europe observes you, glory awaits you, and I am impatient to restore peace to my people." It was signed by Louis. "Why, the King himself supposes the people would receive him!" said Wales. "Men in his condition are capable of supposing anything. Take your pen, and write my answer." It ran thus: "I have received, sir, your letter. I thank you for the obliging expres- sions which it contains regarding myself. "You should renounce all hope of returning to France. You could not do so but over the bodies of one hundred thousand Frenchmen. Sacrifice your interest to the repose and happiness of France. History will duly appreciate your conduct in so doing. I am not insensible to the misfortunes of your family, and shall learn with pleasure that you are surrounded with every- thing which can secure the tranquillity of your retreat." Your Highness will, I hope, excuse me," said Wales, with unaffected gravity, when Napoleon signed the letter; "but I must ask the favour of you not to send this letter-" "Not to send this answer! And you ask it as a favour!" "Your Highness misunderstands me. I mean the original draft of it in my hand. His Majesty is quite familiar with my autography." "Oh ho! True, my little diplomatist! What a blow it would be coming from under your hand! Well, well; the little corporal will copy it for you. But what do you think of my answer?" "I must believe the French people will hot have the old dynasty, as you have stated." "Then, you, too, must abandon them, and attach yourself exclusively to me."     328        TIIE MONARCHST. - "Suppose you should follow the example of Washington? You have his statue in the great gallery, and it is more admired than any other." "I had it placed there for a purpose; but not the purpose of following the example of the original. You say Washington was overwhelmed with vexations and miseries in his retirement, up to the hour of his death. Is that an example for me to follow?" "I hope not." "Nay, you may be sure not! I will recall the royalists, but not the Bourbons. Like the Stuarts, that race has ceased to reign, for ever. A Caesar or a Charlemagne succeeds. Washing- ton retired at the age of sixty-five. I am not thirty-two. I will have thirty-three years in which to decide the manner of my exit." "Can you, will you, ascend a throne?" "An Imperial one. Already I have the power. Nothing remains but the form." "Then I am with you, for life, or for death!" "Very good. Although the least, you shall not be the most insignificant of my subjects. Much remains to be done. I cannot pause, without retrograding. I am embarked in a career of glory. Crowns shall be my playthings, kingdoms my estates. Merit shall be exalted. Captains shall, be generals, generals princes and kings. Imperishable rays of glory will illuminate for ever the scenes of my victories. When my conquests are ended, whatever may be my fate, my battles will be repeated by admiring tongues, and my day be referred to as the golden one in modern history. It will be viewed as the most brilliant age of romance, the sunlight of chivalry. Some may regret the blood ald carnage of war, and denounce me as the cause of direful misfortunes. I am an instrument. I feel within me the evidences of my mission. Europe is to be reconstructed, as Canaan was, and Providence has designated me for the work. I undertake it. There is no general in existence can withstand me. My victories are gained before a blow is struck. All the nations were originally the fruits of conquest. They are destined to be conquered again." "But who will succeed you?" asked Wales. "My name will remain," said Napoleon, after a long pause; "until some one of my family be found worthy to ascend my throne. My spirit will abide with the people. They will not relinquish the glory I have won for them. No; I cannot pause. England has refused to treat. England will be the last to fall." "Pardon me," said Wales; "but I would warn you against that power. You cannot march upon her island territory; but   THE MONARCHST.          329 she can always find access to any part of Europe. But above all things, I would warn you against the plots of the assassins!" I hold Fouch6 responsible for the conduct of the republicams." "It is not the republicans I refer to." "The royalists will be my friends!" At that moment, it being late in the afternoon, Generals Lannes, Berthier, and Lauriston were announced. Upon being admitted, they besought the First Consul to visit the opera. After some hesitation he assented, and Wales retired to his lodgings in the Rue St. Nicaise. He had not been long in his room, when looking down from the balconied window, he beheld, for the first time, all three of the mysterious individuals he had so long been watching, stand- ing together. After a hurried conference, two of them departed towards the Carrousel, while the other ignited a cigar, and loitered near a small cart, the horse of which was held by the young girl who had led him up to the room of Georges. Having been in the habit of conversing with the girl for the, purpose of ascer- taining the habits of Georges' visiters, and supposing she might now afford him some information in relation to the three men who attracted his attention, he descended to the street and ap- proached the cart just as the wheels of the First Consul's carriage were in hearing. The man with the cigar became much agitated. The carriage, driven with more than usual rapidity, was even with them in a moment. The horse of one of the guards came in collision with the excited stranger, and almost prostrated him. He rose, however, and seizing the cigar which had fallen to the earth, ran to the cart, and applied it to a match. This was per- ceived by Wales. "Run! run, boy! Run for your life!" exclaimed the man. Wales threw up his arms, and cried aloud to the coachman to drive still faster. He was heard and obeyed. And no sooner had the-carriage glided into a slight curve of the winding street, where it was obscured by the interposing houses, than the ex- plosion took place. Master Robert, the poor girl, and six other persons, were instantly killed, while twenty-eight others were wounded, and more than forty houses were either demolished or damaged. The body of Wales was found and identified. It was unin- jured; but the head was gone. In his pocket were found bills amounting to 200,000 francs. The sum was never demanded by any one, and still remains, it may be presumed, for the bene- fit of his heirs, should any be in existence, and their claims be properly authenticated. 28*     330         TIE MONARCHST. CONCLUSION. THE two clergymen of the eastern shore remained in their parishes, and lived to utter prayers for the President of the United States, and all others in authority. Mr. Hewitt, in par- ticular, experienced no diminution of his ecclesiastical benefice. The fine glebe of five hundred acres was suffered to remain attached to the parish church. To this day it remains; and it is probably the only instance of the kind in the United States, where the original glebe still supports the parish priest. Mr. Duche fled to England, but was permitted to return after the peace. Mr. Craig, the Methodist preacher, was soon liberated, and lived to see thousands converted to his faith in eastern Virginia. The young gentlemen and ladies of the county were married, as has been seen, according to their wishes; and probably if the names of all their descendants were written down, no book could contain them. Squire West died at a good old age,*of the gout, which he de- clared to the last was not a disease but a remedy. The old farm is still in the possession of his descendants, but is by no means so productive as it was in his day. Captain Waples died but a few years since, leaving a numerous progeny. At the age of seventy, and when he had great-grand- children, he married a second wife. His last marriage added four more to the number of his offspring. He became a Baptist ex- horter; but still loved to dwell on the stirring scenes of the past. His patriotism was part of his religion. Even in his extreme old age, his delight was to inspire the youth of his acquaintance with a love of country and veneration for the memory of Wash- ington. Colonel Cropper served throughout the war; and when Wash- ington was appointed Lieutenant-General, in the last years of his life, the Colonel was among the first he applied to to become one of his field officers in the war expected with France. That letter is in the possession of one of his grandchildren, and has been re- peatedly seen by the author.   THE MONARCHST.         331 Mrs. Darrah died in Philadelphia, universally respected. The good schoolmaster, her husband, did not, after all, so far as we can learn, succeed in being made a librarian. But we have been informed that several of Kingsburgh's countrymen, not having his objections, accepted such appointments. General Gates remained on his farm in Virginia until 1790, when he removed to New York, where he died in 1806, at the age of seventy-four, and was much respected. General Conway returned to France, and died soon after. General Lee died in Philadelphia, at the old Penn mansion, which still remains standing, in Second street, between Walnut and Chestnut. He was eccentric to the last; and desired that they would not bury him within a half-mile of any Presbyterian graveyard. Mrs. Ferguson, we believe, died in England, highly esteemed for her amiable disposition, and the charms of her conversation. John Roberts and Abram Carlisle, the'Quaker umpires for-the British, were both hung in 1778. Galloway, the Quaker lawyer, departed with the British. Colonel Reed, afterwards President of Pennsylvania, died in 1781, universally esteemed. He was never again separated from Mrs. R., by the enemy, after meeting with her at York. And if King George was not rich enough to buy him, it may be sup- posed all the potentates in the world could not have bribed her to abandon her husband's cause. What became of Miss Franks, we have not, we confess, with sorrow, been able to learn. But we shall not cease to inquire. Mr. Jefferson, after serving eight years as the President of the United States, followed the example of Washington, and retired to his farm. But in retirement he continued his ex- ertions for the promotion of the interest of science and litera- ture. He died, as the world knows, on the 4th of July, in the eighty-fourth year of his age. His estate was sold to pay his debts. But the principles he proclaimed, still govern the ma- jority of the people; and the party he organized is still in ex- istence. The Kingsburghs returned to Scotland. * Their descendants still dwell near the scene which afforded a secure shelter to the fugitive prince, Charles Edward Stuart.     ADDENDA. As some of the facts stated in the preceding pages in relation to Washing- ton's disquietude in his retirement, and the modification of his original purpose with respect to the receiving of pay for his services, may seem to demand a better authentication, than the mere assertions of the novelist, or rather the declarations of his characters, the following extracts from letters written by the illustrious chief, just before the close of his mortal career, and to which the reader may not have had access, may be appropriately added. Washington, the year before his death, accented the commission of Com- mander-in-chief from Mr. Adams, on the condition that he should be permitted to name the principal officers who were to serve with him. Mr. McHenry, the Secretary of War, was the one through Whom the condition was made known to the President. Subsequently, it appears, the President desired to avoid the terms of the agreement. The following is an extract from a letter written by Washington to Mr. McHenry. It is dated at Mount Vernon, in September, 1798. "Your confi- dential letter, with its enclosures, has been received. The contents of them have filled my mind with much disquietude and embarrassment; but it is im- possible for me to make any move at this time, from the want of official grounds, without betraying your confidential communication. "I can perceive pretty clearly, however, that the matter is, or very soon will be, brought to the alternative of submitting to the President's forgetful- ness of what I considered a compact or condition of acceptance of the appoint- ment, or of returning to him my commission." The following is taken from a letter written a few days after the above, by Washington to President Adams:-"I will now respectfully ask, in what man- ner these stipulations [the condition above referred to] have been complied with? In the arrangement made by me with the Secretary of War, the three major-generals stood, Hamilton, Pinckney, Knox; and in this order I expected their commissions would be dated. But you have been pleased to order the last to be first, and the first to be last. Of four brigadiers for the provisional army, one, whom I never heard of as a military character, has been nominated and appointed; and another is so well known to all those who served with him in the Revolution, as for the appointment to have given the greatest dis- gust, and will be the means of preventing more valuable officers of that army from coming forward. One adjutant-general has been, and another is ready to-be, appointed, in case of the non-acceptance of Mr. North, not only without any consultation with me, but without the least intimation of the intention; although in the letter I had the honour to write you on the 4th of July, I en- deavoured to show, in a strong point of view, how important it was that this officer should be agreeable to the Commander-in-chief, and possess his entire (italicised by Washington) confidence. . .         . "It is an invidious task at all times to draw comparisons, and I shall avoid (332)   ADDENDA.              333 it as much as possible; but I have no hesitation in declaring, that, if the public is to be deprived of the services of Colonel Hamilton in the military line, the post he was destined to fill will not be easily supplied; and that this is the sentiment of the public, I think I can venture to pronounce. Although Colonel Hamilton has never acted in the character of a general officer, yet his oppor- tunities, as the principal and most confidential aid of the commander-in-chief, &c., &c. These advantages, and his having served with usefulness in the old Congress, in the General Convention, and having filled one of the most im- portant departments of government with acknowledged abilities and integrity, have placed him on high ground, and made him a conspicuous character in the United States, and even in Europe. -  - - By some he is considered an ambitious man, and therefore a dangerous one. That he is ambitious, I shall readily grant, but it is of that laudable kind, which prompts a man to excel in whatever he takes in hand. . i  K I repeat that his loss will be irreparable. "I will say but little relative to the appointment of the brigadiers before alluded to; but I must not conceal, that, after what had passed, and my under- standing of the compact, my feelings were not a little wounded by the appoint- ment of any, much more such characters, without my knowledge. "I have addressed you, sir, with openness and candour, requesting to be informed, whether your determination to reverse the order of the three major- generals is final, and whether you mean to appoint another adjutant-general without my concurrence," &c., &c. The following (a confidential letter) was written to Timothy Pickering, Secretary of State, dated Mount Vernon, October 1, 1796. "The letter written by Mr. Walcott to the President, and the representation made by me to him so soon as I received official information of the change intended by him in the relative rank of the major-generals, and of his departure, in alimost every other instance, from what I considered a solemn compact, and the only terms on which I would, by an acceptance of the commission, hazard everything dear and valuable to me, will soon bring matters to a close, so far as it respects myself. But, until the final result of them is known, the less there is said on the subject, the better." Extract of a letter to Lafayette, dated Mount Vernon, 25th December, 1798. "A party exists in the United States, formed by a combination of causes, which oppose the government in -all its measures, and are determined, as all their conduct evinces, by clogging its wheels, indirectly to change the nature of it, and to subvert the Constitution. To effect this, no means which have a tendency to accomplish their purposes are left unessayed. The friends of government, who are anxious to maintain its neutrality, and to preserve the country in peace, and adopt measures to secure these objects, are charged by them as being monarchists, aristocrats, and infractors of the Constitution, which, according to their interpretation of it, would be a Mere cipher. - ' * They arrogated to themselves the sole merit of being the friends of France, when, in fact, they had no more regard for that nation than for the Grand Turk, further than their own views were promoted by it; denouncing those who differed in opinion, as acting under British influence," &c. A few weeks after, Washington urged Patrick Henry to re-enter public life. The following is a portion of his appeal:-"But, at such a crisis as this, when everything dear and valuable to us is assailed; when this party [Mr. Jeffer- son's] hangs upon the wheels of government as a dead weight, opposing every measure that is calculated for defence and self-preservation, abetting the nefarious views of another nation [France] upon our rights, preferring, as long as they can contend openly against the people, the interests of France to the welfare of their own country, justifying the former.- at the expense of the latter; while every act of their own government is tortured, by constructions they will not bear, into attempts to infringe and trample upon the Constitution with a view to introduce monarchy; when the most unceasing and the purest exertions, which were making to maintain a neutrality, proclaimed by the     334             ADDENDA. executive, approved, &c., &c.-are charged with being measures calculated to favour Great Britain at the expense of France, &c.-when measures, &c., are pursued, which must eventually dissolve the Union, or produce coercion; I say, when these things have become so obvious, ought characters, who are best able to rescue their country from the pending evil, to remain at home?" On the 20th January, 1799-the year in which he died-Washington wrote as follows to a. correspondent in Europe:- "When I offered my Valedictory Address to the people of the United States, I little thought that any event would arise in my day, that could withdraw me from the retreat in which I expected to pass the remnant of a life worn down with cares, in ruminating on past scenes, and contemplating the future grandeur of this rising empire. But we know little of ourselves, and much less of the designs of Providence." On the 25th March, 1799, he wrote a very lengthy confidential letter to the Secretary of War, from which the following extracts are;made:- "What keeps back the commissions and arrests the recruiting service? Be assured that both, among the friends of government, excite astonishment and discontent. Many are highly disgusted; some talk of giving up the idea of becoming officers, &c.-and all are complaining. Applications are made to me by numbers, to know what the cause of the delay is, &c. What could I say? Am I not kept in as much ignorance as they are themselves? Am I advised of any appointment, any changes which have taken place? any of the views or designs of government relative to the army? It is not unreasonable to suppose, that, if there be reasons of state, inducing the policy of these delays, I was entitled to sufficient confidence to be let into the secret. i s  %  The case of Gibbs, I allude to. He served through the whole Revolutionary war. He was strongly recommended; yet the vote of a member of Congress (I presume) was more respected than [conclusion of the paragraph illegible]. I find by the Gazettes (I have no other information), that Lieutenant Mercer is promoted to the rank of captain. He was not even placed high up among the lieutenants. What will those lieutenants who are his seniors, think of having him placed over them?. Mercer, compared to them, is a boy. I do not mean to derogate from the merits or demerits of this young gentleman. On the con- trary, I wish to see them properly rewarded, although his whole family are bitter in their enmity to the general government. - :: It is not my in- tention to dispute the powers of the President to make this or any other pro- motion, which his inclination or the solicitation of others may prompt him to; but I will add, without fear of contradiction from any one acquainted with the usages and prescriptive rights of armies, that, if he wishes to preserve' the peace and harmony of ours, rules must be observed in promotions, and the feelings of the officers attended to. -  "- -' As vacancies have happened in the cavalry by non-acceptances, and promotions have begun, may I ask if there would be. any impropriety in letting Mr. Custis step from a cornetcy into the rank of lieutenant? ' ^  ' If ample fortune, a good education, more than common abilities, and a good disposition, free from vice of any kind, give him a title, in the nineteenth year of his age, his pretensions (though not to the injury of others) are good. But it is not my desire to ask this as a favour. I never have and never shall solicit anything for myself or connexions. I mean nothing more than the statement of facts, in order to bring his situa- tion to view." The following, from a letter to Bushrod Washington, will serve to show it was impossible for the General to divest himself of anxiety in regard to the operations of parties. The letter is dated the 5th of May, 1799:--"The elec- tion of Generals Lee [Henry] and Marshall are grateful to my feelings. I wish, however, both of them had been elected by greater majorities; but they are elected, and that alone is pleasing. "As the tide is turned, I hope it will come in with a full flow; but this will not happen, if there is any relaxation on the part of the federalists. We are cure there will be none on the part of the republicans [Jefferson's party--the   ADDENDA.              335 italics are Washington's], as they very erroneously call themselves. I appre- hended latterly, that Mr. Hancock will not carry his election, and that in numbers we shall not exceed nine. In point of abilities, I think the superi- ority will be greatly on the side of federalism. "I have mentioned Mr. Turner's name to the Secretary of War; but, in a letter I received from him last night, he thinks the President has given, or will give, the vacant troop to a gentleman in another state." Extract from a letter to the Secretary of War, dated in August, 1799:- "Colonel Cropper, of the eastern shore, has signified to me his willingness to accept the command of a regiment, and has promised to furnish a list of names for other officers; but his selection will be limited to a few counties, or at most to one district." Extract from a letter to Alexander Hamilton, dated 27th October, 1799, less than two months before the death of Washington:-"The purport of your private letter of the 21st, with respect to a late decision [of the President's], has surprised me exceedingly. I was surprised at the measure; how much more so at the manner of it! This business seems to have commenced in an evil hour, and under unfavourable auspices. I wish mischief may not tread in all its steps, and be the final result of the measure. A wide door was open, through which a retreat might have been made from the first faux pas, the shutting of which, to those who are not behind the curtain, and are as little acquainted with the secrets of the Cabinet as I am, is, from the present aspect of European affairs, quite incomprehensible. But I have the same reliance on Providence, which you express, and trust that matters will end well, however unfavourable they may appear at present." From a letter to Mr. McHenry, Secretary of War, dated 17th November, 1799, less than a month before his death:- "Your confidential and interesting letter of the 10th instant came duly and safely to hand; with the contents of which I have been stricken dumb; and I believe it is better that I should remain mute than express any sentiment on the important matters which are related therein. "I have, some time past, viewed the political concerns of the United States with an anxious and painful eye. They appear to me to be moving, by hasty strides, to a crisis; but in what it will result, that Being, who sees, foresees, and directs all things, alone can tell. The vessel is afloat, or very nearly so, and considering myself as a passenger only, I shall trust to the mariners (whose duty it is to watch), to steer it into a safe port. * - ' I ask again, on what is the accusation founded? [That Washington had been governed by British influence, when he appointed Mr. Pinckney minister to London.] The whole is a mystery to me. Merely to satisfy my curiosity, I wish to have it unriddled; and not, from the present view I have of the subject, because I shall think myself bound to answer any interrogatories [they threatened to have a committee to take Washington's testimony] which may be dictated by impertinence." His last letter, written two days before his death, was to Alexander Hamil- ton, expressing views decidedly in favour of the Military Academy at West Point. On the 14th September, 1799, Washington wrote to Mr. McHenry as fol- lows:-"I am resolved to draw nothing from the public but reimbursements for actual expenditures; unless, by being called into the field, I should be en- titled to full pay and the emoluments of office." In a preceding paragraph of the same letter, Washington said:-"I feel much obliged, and accordingly thank you for ordering me two months' pay, and I shall not suffer false modesty to assert that my finances stand in no need of it; because it is not the time, nor the attention only, which the public duties I am engaged in, require, but their bringing upon me applicants, recommenders of applicants, and seekers of information, none of whom perhaps are my ac- quaintances, with their servants and horses to aid in the consumption of my forage, and what to me is far more valuable, my time, that I most regard; for     336             ADDENDA. a man in the country, nine miles from any house of entertainment, is differently situated from one in a city, where none of these inconveniences are felt." Just before Washington died, Governor Trumbull, and many other influ- ential characters, wrote to him, urging the necessity of his again becoming the President of the United States, to prevent the government from falling into the hands of Mr. Jefferson and his party. Mr. Sparks says, "No answer, nor any remarks on the subject by Washington, are found among his papers." THE CABAL. Early in 1778, Patrick Henry received an anonymous letter, dated at York- town, Pennsylvania, where Congress was then sitting (the British being in possession of Philadelphia), detracting from the merits of General Washington, and urging the necessity of having him superseded in the office of Commander- in-chief. This letter was immediately sent by Mr. Henry to Washington himself. In reply to Mr. Henry's letter, Washington wrote as follows:- "The anonymous letter with which you were pleased to favour me, was written by Dr. R , so far as I can judge from a similitude of hands. This man has been elaborate and studied in his professions of regard for me; and long since the letter to you. My caution to avoid anything which could injure the service, prevented me from communicating, but to a very few of my friends, the intrigues of a faction which I knew was formed against me, since it might serve to publish our internal dissensions; but their own restless zeal to advance their views has too clearly betrayed them, and made concealment on my part fruitless. I cannot precisely mark the extent of their views, but it appeared in general, that General Gates was to be exalted on the ruin of my reputation and influence. This I am authorized to say, from undeniable facts in my own possession, from publications the evident scope of which could not be mis- taken, and from private detractions industriously circulated. General Mifflin, it is commonly supposed, bore the second part in the cabal; and General Conway, I know, was a very active and malignant partisan; but I have good reasons to believe, that their machinations have recoiled most sensibly upon themselves." THE END.
