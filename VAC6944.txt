            THE RUFFIAN BARBER. 
             
               CHAPTER I. 
               The Barber's Shop.-Tobias Ragg.-Disappearance of Mr. Thornhill. 
               THERE stood at the time our story commences, and for aught we know to the contrary, there stands now, near to that sacred edifice-old St. Dunstan's church-a small shop, then occupied as a barber's shop by a man named Sweeney Todd, a long, low-jointed, ill-put-together sort of a follow, with all immense mouth, and such huge hands and feet that he was, in his way, quite a natural curiosity; and, what was more wonderful, considering his trade, there never was seen such a head of hair as Sweeny Todd's. We know not what to compare it to; probably it came the nearest to what one might suppose to be the appearance of a thick-set hedge, in which a quantity of small wire had got entangled. At any rate it was a terrific head of hair. 
               Mr. Todd squinted a little to add to his charms, and though some laughed at him, there were others who shook their heads when they spoke of him. But for all that he did a thriving business. 
               There was one thing that seemed to detract from the great prudence of Sweeney Todd's character, and that was he rented a large house, of which he occupied nothing but the shop and parlor, leaving the upper part entirely useless, and absolutely refusing to let it on any terms. 
               The day was drawing to a close, a drizzling rain was falling, and Sweeney Todd sat in his shop, looking keenly in the face of a boy, who stood in an attitude of trembling subjection before him. 
               "You will remember, Tobias Ragg," said Sweeney Todd, and he gave his countenance a most horrible twist as he spoke, "that you are my apprentice, and now, Tobias, listen to me-I'll cut your throat from ear to ear, if you repeat one word of what passes in this shop, or dare to make any supposition, or draw any conclusion from anything you may see or hear, or fancy you see or hear. Now you understand me, I'll cut your throat from ear to ear-do you understand me?" 
               "Yes, sir, I won't say nothing. I wish, sir, as I may be made into veal pies at Lovett's Bell-yard, if I as much as says a word." 
               "Very good," said Todd, "I'm quite satisfied; and mark me-the shop, and the shop only, is your place." 
               "Yes, sir." 
               "Now run out and see what's o'clock by St. Dunstan's." 
               There was a small crowd collected opposite the church, for the figures were about to strike three-quarters past six; and among that crowd was one man who gazed with as much curiosity as anybody at the exhibition. 
                
               "Now for it," he said, "they are going to begin; well, that is ingenious. Look at the fellow lifting up his club, and down it comes, bang on the old bell." 
               The three-quarters were struck by the figures, and then the people walked away, with the exception of the man who seemed so deeply interested. He remained, and crouching at his feet was a noble-looking dog. 
               "What do you think of that, Hector?" said the man. 
               The dog gave a short low whine, and his master proceeded- 
               "There is a barber's shop opposite, so before I go any further, as I have got to see the ladies, although it's on a very melancholy errand, for I have got to tell them that poor Mark Ingestrie is no more, and heaven knows what poor Johanna will say-I think I should know her by his description of her, poor fellow! How he used to talk about her on long night-watches. Well, well, it's no use grieving; he is dead and gone, poor fellow, and the salt water washes over as brave a heart as ever beat. His sweetheart. Johanna, though, shall have the string of pearls for all that, and if she can't be Mark Ingestrie's bride in this world, she shall be rich and happy while she stays in it, that is to say as happy as she can be; and she must just look forward to meeting him aloft, where there are no squalls or tempests. So I'll go and get shaved at once." 
               He crossed the road towards Sweeney Todd's shop, and stepping down the low doorway, he stood face to face with the odd-looking barber. 
               The dog gave a low growl, and sniffed the air. 
               "Why, Hector," said his master, "what's the matter? Down, sir, down!" 
               "I have a mortal fear of dogs," said Todd, "would you mind him, sir, sitting outside the door and waiting for you, if it's all the same? Only look at him, he's going to fly at me." 
               "Then you are the first person he ever touched without provocation," said the man; "but I suppose he don't like your looks, and I must confess I ain't much surprised at that. I have seen a few rum-looking guys in my time, but hang me if I ever saw such a figure-head as yours. What devil's noise was that?" 
               "It was only me," said Sweeney Todd, "I laughed." 
               "Laughed! do you call that a laugh? I suppose you caught if of somebody who died of it." 
               "Stop the dog! stop the dog! I can't have dogs running into my back-parlor," said the barber. 
               "Here, Hector, here!" cried his master; "get out." 
               Most unwillingly the dog left the shop, and crouched down close to the outer door, which the barber closed, and then, turning to his apprentice, said- 
               "Tobias, my lad, go to Peterson's, and get a small bag of biscuits. Now, sir, I suppose you want to be shaved, and it's well you have come here, for there ain't a barber that ever thinks of polishing anybody off as I do. Who are you? where did you come from? and where are you going?" 
               "That's cool; and since you are so fond of asking questions, just answer me one. Do you know a Mr. Oakley who lives somewhere in London, and is a spectacle-maker?" 
               "Yes, to be sure I do-John Oakley, the spectacle-maker, in Fore-street, and he has got a daughter named Johanna, that the young bloods call the Flower of Fore-street." 
               "Ah, poor thing! do they? Now, confused you, what are you laughing at?" 
               "Just turn your head a little a one side; that will do. You have been to sea, sir?" 
               "Yes, I have, and have only now lately come up the river from an Indian voyage." 
               "Indeed! where can my strop be? I had it this minute. I must have laid it down somewhere. What an odd thing that I can't see it! It's very extraordinary; what can have become of it? Oh! I recollect, I took it into the parlor. Sit still, sir, I shall not be gone a moment." 
               Sweeney Todd walked into the back parlor and closed the door. There was a strange sound suddenly, compounded of a rushing noise and then a heavy blow, immediately after which Sweeney Todd emerged from his parlor, and folding his arms, he looked upon the vacant chair where his customer had been seated, but the customer was gone, leaving not the slightest trace of his presence behind except his hat, and that Sweeney Todd immediately seized and thrust into a cupboard that was at one corner of the shop. 
               "What's that," he said, "scratching at the door?" 
               Tobias, who had now returned, opened the shop-door, and there stood the dog, who looked wistfully round the place. 
               "It's the gentleman's dog, sir," said Tobias, "it's the gentleman's dog, sir, that was looking at old St. Dunstan's clock, and who came in here to be shaved. Did you ever see such a violent fellow? why he will have down the cupboard door." 
               "Stop him! stop him! the devil's in the animal." 
               The dog was certainly getting the door open, when Sweeney Todd rushed forward to stop him, but the dog gave him a grip in the leg, and he precipitately retreated. The dog forced open the cupboard door seized the hat which Sweeney Todd had thrust therein, and dashed out of the shop with it in triumph. 
               "The devil's in the beast!" muttered Todd, "he's off! Tobias, you said you saw the man who owned that fiend of a cur looking at St. Dustan's church." 
               "Yes, sir; and I heard him say that Mark Ingestrie was dead, and Johanna should have the string of pearls. Then he came in, and I came in, and the odd thing you know to me, sir, is that he didn't take his dog with him, because you know, sir--" 
               "Know what?" shouted Todd. 
               "You know people do generally take their dogs with them, sir, and may I be made into one of Lovett's pies, if I don't--" 
               "Hush, some one comes; it's old Mr. Grant from the Temple. Sit down, sir; a little this way. Shaved, I suppose?" 
               "Yes, Todd, yes. Any news?" 
               "No, sir, nothing stirring. We haven't had anybody in the shop for an hour and a half." 
               "Lor' sir," said Tobias, "you forget the sea-faring gentleman with the dog, you know, sir." 
               "Ah! so I do," said Todd. "He went away, and I saw him get into some disturbance just at the corner of the market." 
               "I wonder I didn't meet him, sir," said Tobias, "for I came that way, and then it's so very odd, leaving his dog behind him." 
               "Yes, very," said Todd. "Excuse me a moment, Mr. Grant. Tobias, my lad, I just want you to lend me a hand in the parlor." 
               Tobias very unsuspectingly followed the barber into the parlor, but when they got in and the door was closed, the barber sprang upon him like an enraged tiger, and grappled him by the throat, then tore a handful of his hair out, after which he twisted him round, and dealt him such a kick that he was flung sprawling into a corner of the room, and then walked out and apologized to his customer for keeping him waiting- 
               "It became necessary, sir, to teach my new apprentice a little bit of his business. I have left him studying it now. There is nothing like teaching young folks at once." 
               "Ah!" said Mr. Grant with a sigh, "I know what it is to let young folks grow wild; for although I have neither chick nor child of my own, I had a sister's son to look to-a handsome, wild, harum-scarum sort of a fellow, as like me as one pea is like another. I tried to make a lawyer of him; but it wouldn't do, and it's now more than two years ago, he left me altogether, and yet there were some good things about Mark." 
               "Mark, sir! Did you say Mark?" 
               "Yes, that was his name-Mark Ingestrie. Good knows what's become of him." 
             
             
               CHAPTER II. 
               The Spectacle-Maker's Daughter. 
               "JOHANNA, Johanna, my dear, do you know what time it is! Johanna, I say, are you going to get up? I haven't had a morsel of breakfast yet." 
               These observations were made by Mr. Oaklay, the spectacle-maker, at the door of his daughter Johanna's chamber, on the morning after the events we have just recorded at Sweeny Todd's. 
               "I am coming, father; I am coming. In a moment I shall be down," 
               The little old spectacle-maker descended the staircase again, where, in a few moments he was joined by Johanna, his only and his much-loved child. She was indeed a creature of the rarest grace and beauty. Her age was eighteen; but she looked rather younger, and upon her face she had that sweetness and intelligence of expression that almost bids defiance to the march of time. There was a touch of sadness about her voice, which tended to make it more musical, although mournfully so, which seemed to indicate that at the bottom of her heart there lay some grief which had not yet been spoken. 
               "I have kept you waiting, father," she said, as she flung her arms around the old man's neck; "I have kept you waiting." 
               "Never mind, my dear-never mind. Your mother is so taken up with Mr. Lupin, that you know, this being Wednesday morning, she is off to his prayer meeting, and so I have had no breakfast; and really I think I must discharge Sam; he had the coolness to tell me he couldn't take down the shutters this morning, or sweep out the shop, because his aunt had the toothache; but as sure as this is the 20th day of August--" 
               "It is the 20th day of August," said Johanna, as she sunk into a chair and burst into tears. "It is! it is! I know I ought to be attending to you, and was praying for strength to do so, because this was the 20th day of August." 
               When Johanna had ceased speaking, she leaned her sweet face on her hands and wept like a child. 
               The astonishment of the old spectacle-marker was vividly depicted in his countenance. "Good God, Johanna!" he said at length, "what is this! My dear child, what has happened? Tell me, my darling, what it is that vexes you, I'll soon put it to rights." 
               "Father, I know that your affection would do all for me that it is possible to do; but you cannot bring the dead to life, and if this day passes over me and I see him not, nor hear from him, I know that, instead of finding a home for me whom he loved, he has in the effort to do so, found a grave for himself, He said he would." 
               Here she wrung her hands and wept with such anguish, that the old spectacle maker knew not what to do or say. 
               "My dear," he cried, "who is he? I hope you don't mean Mark Ingestrie!" 
               "I do, and if he had a thousand faults, he loved me truly and sincerely." 
               "But what makes this day more than say other, so gloomy to you?" 
                
               "It was on this day two years ago that we last met; and he told me that he must go and seek his fortune-that fortune which he hoped to share with me. He said that he had an opportunity of undertaking a voyage to India, and that if he was successful, he should have sufficient to return with, and commence some pursuit in London more congenial to his habits than the law." 
               "Ah! well, what next?" 
               "He told me that he loved me, and we made an agreement that on that day two years, he was to come to me or send me some news of his whereabouts; if I heard nothing of him, I was to conclude he was no more, and I cannot help so concluding now." 
               "But the day has not yet passed." 
               "I know it has not, and yet I rest upon a slender hope, father. Do you believe that dreams ever really shadow forth coming events?" 
               "I cannot say, my child; I am not disposed to yield credence to any supposed fact because I have dream it; but I must confess to having heard some strange instances where these visions of the night have come strictly true." 
               "Heaven knows but this may be one of them! I had a dream last night. I thought that I was sitting upon the sea-shore, and that all before me was nothing but a fathomless waste of waters. I heard the roar and dash of the waves distinctly, and each moment the wind grew more furious and fierce, and I saw in the distance a ship-it was battling with the waves, which at one moment lifted it mountains high, and at another plunged it far down into such an abyss, that not a vestige of it could be seen but the topmast spars of the tall mast. And still the storm increased each moment in its fury, and ever and anon there came a strange sullen sound across the waters, and I saw a flash of fire, and knew that those in the ill-fated vessel were endeavoring to attract attention and some friendly aid. Farther, from the first to the last I knew that Mark Ingestrie was there-my heart told me so; I was certain he was there, and I was helpless-utterly helpless, utterly and entirely unable to lend the slightest aid. I could only gaze upon what was going forward as a silent and terrified spectator of the scene. And at last I heard a cry come over the deep-a strange loud, wailing cry-which proclaimed to me the fate of the vessel. I saw its mass shiver for a moment in the blackened air, and then all was still for a few seconds, until there arose a strange, wild shriek, that I knew was the despairing cry of those who sank, never to rise again, in that vessel. Oh! that was a frightful sound-it was a sound to linger on the ears, and haunt the memory of sleep-it was a sound never to be forgotten when once heard, but such as might again and again be remembered with horror and affright." 
               "And all this was in your dream?" 
               "It was, as you shall hear. The ship went down, and that cry that I had heard was the last despairing one given by those who clung to the wreck with scarce a hope, and yet because it was their only refuge, for where else had they to look for the smallest ray of consolation? where else, save in the surging water were they to turn for safety? Nowhere! all was lost! all was despair! I tried to scream-I tried to cry aloud to Heaven to have mercy upon those brave and gallant souls who had trusted their dearest possession-life itself-to the mercy of the deep; and while I so tried to render so inefficient succor, I saw a small speck in the sea, and my straining eyes perceived that it was man floating and clinging to a piece of the wreck, and I knew it was Mark Ingestrie." 
               "But, my dear, surely you are not annoyed at a dream?" 
               "It saddened me-I stretched out my arms to save him-I heard him pronounce my name, and call upon me for help. 'Twas all in vain; he battled with the waves as long as human nature could battle with them.-He could do no more, and I saw him disappear before my anxious eyes." 
                
               "Don't say you saw him, my dear, say you fancy you saw him. 
               "It was such a fancy as I shall not lose the remembrance of for many a day." 
               "Well, well, after all, my dear, it's only a dream; so dry your eyes, Johanna, and, as I go to Alderman Judd's I'll think over matter, which, after all, may not be so bad as you think. The lad is a good enough looking lad, and has, I believe, a good ability, if he would put it to some useful purpose; but if he goes scampering about the world in an unsettled manner, you are well rid of him, and as for his being dead, you must not conclude that by any means, for somehow or another, like a bad penny, some fellows always come back." 
               There was more consolation in the kindly tone of the spectacle-maker than in the words he used; and when he had gone, she felt that by the mere relation of her secret to him, some of the terrors of her dream had vanished. 
               She sat for some time in a pleasing reverie, till she was interrupted by Sam, the shop-boy, who came into the parlor and said,- 
               "Please, Miss Johanna, suppose I was to go down to the docks and try and find out for you Mr. Mark Ingestrie." 
               "What do you mean?" 
               "I mean that I won't stand it; didn't I tell you more than three weeks ago, as you was the object of my infections? Didn't I tell you that when aunt died, I should come in for the soap and candle business, and make you my missus?" 
               The only reply which Johanna gave to this was to rise and leave the room. 
               "A thousand d--s!" said he, when he entered the shop; "I always suspected there was some other fellow, and now I know it I am ready to gnaw my head off that ever I consented to come here. Confound him! I hope he is at the bottom of the sea, and eat up this time. Oh! I should like to smash everybody. If I had my way now I'd just walk into society at large, as they calls it, and let it know what one, two, three, slay in the eye is-and down it would go." 
               Mr. Sam, in his rage, did upset a case of spectacles, which went down with a tremendous crash, and which, however good imitation of the manner in which society at large was to be knocked down, was not likely to be at all pleasing to Mr. Oakley. 
               "I have done it now," he said; "but never mind-I'll try the old dodge, whenever I break anything. That is, place it in old place it in old Oakley's way, and swear he did it." 
             
             
               CHAPTER III. 
               Hector in pursuit of his Master. 
               THE earliest dawn of morning was glistening upon the masts, the cordage and the sails of a fleet of vessels lying below Sheerness. 
               The crews were rousing themselves from their night's repose, and began to make their appearance on the deck of the vessels, from which the night-watch had just been relieved. 
               A man-of-war, which had been the convoy of the fleet of merchantmen through the channel, fired a gun as the glimpse of the morning-sun fell upon her tapering masts. Then from a battery in the neighborhood came another booming report, and that was answered by another farther off, and then another, until the whole chain of batteries that girded the coast, for it was a time of war, had proclaimed the dawn of another day. 
               The effect was very fine, in the stillness of the early morn of this succession of reports; and as they died away in the like mimic thunder, some order was given on board the man-of-war, and in a moment, the masts and cordage seemed perfectly alive with human beings clinging to them in various directions. Then, as if by magic, or as if the ship had been a living thing itself, and had possessed wings, which, at the mere instigation of a wish, could be spread far and wide, there fluttered out such sheets of canvass as was wonderful to see. 
               The crews of the merchantmen stood upon the decks of their respective vessels, gazing after the ship-of-war, as she proceeded upon another mission similar to the one she had just performed, in protecting the commerce of the country. As she passed one vessel, which had been, in point of fact, actually rescued from the enemy, the crew, who had been saved from a foreign prison, cheered lustily. There wanted but such an impulse as this, and then every merchant vessel that the man-of-war passed, took up the gladsome shout, and the crew of the huge vessel were not slow in their answer, by three deafening cheers. 
               These proceedings were amply sufficient to arouse the crews of all the vessels, and over the taffrail of one in particular, a large sized merchantman, which had been trading in the Indian seas, two men were leaning. One of them was the captain of the vessel, and the other a passenger who intended leaving that morning. They were engaged in earnest conversation, and the captain, as he shaded his eyes with his hand, and looked along the surface of the river, said, in reply to some observation of his companion: 
               "I'll order my boat the moment Lieut. Thornhill comes on board. I call him Lieut., although I have no right to do so, because he has held that rank in the king's service, but when quite a young man was cashiered for fighting a duel with hi superior officer." 
               "The service has lost a good officer," said the other. 
               "It has, indeed-a braver man never stepped-nor a better officer; but you see they have certain rules in the service, and everything is sacrificed to maintain them. I can't think what keeps him. He went last night, and said he would pull up to the Temple stairs, because he wanted to call upon somebody by the water-side, and after would have brought him nearer here, you see, and there are plenty of things coming down the river." 
               "He's coming," cried the other. Don't be impatient; you will see him in a few minutes." 
               "What makes you think that?" 
               "Because I see his dog-there, don't you see him, swimming in the water, and coming towards the ship?" 
               "I cannot imagine-I can see the dog, certainly; but I can't see Thornhill, nor is there any boat at hand. I know not what to make of it. Do you know my mind misgives me that something has happened amiss! The dog seems exhausted. Lend a hand there to Mr. Thornhill's dog, some of you. Why, it's a hat he has in his mouth." 
               The dog made towards the vessel, and with the assistance of the seamen, he reached the deck, where he lay in a state of complete exhaustion, with the hat still in his grasp. The sailors looked at each other in amazement, and the opinion was general that something serious had happened to Mr. Thornhill. 
               "What can this mean?" said the captain,-"that's Thornhill's hat and here's Hector. Give the dog some meat directly." 
               The dog ate sparingly, and then, seizing the hat again in his mouth, stood by the side of the ship and howled piteously; then he put it down, and walking up to the captain, pulled him by the skirt of the coat. 
               "You understand him," said the captain to the passenger; "something has happened to Thornhill, the object of the dog is to get me to follow him." 
                
               "Think you so? it is a warning, if it be such at all, that I should not be inclined to neglect, and if you will follow the dog, I will accompany you." 
               The captain ordered the boat to be launched at once, and manned by four stout rowers, into which he stepped, followed by the passenger, Colonel Jeffery, of the Indian army, and the dog immediately followed them. The captain ordered the boat to proceed up the river, and as at that time the Thames was not a thoroughfare for steamboats, they reached the ancient Temple stairs. 
               The dog, who had until then seemed to be asleep, suddenly sprang up, and seized the hat in his mouth, rushed again on shore, and was closely followed by the captain and colonel. 
               He led them through the temple with great rapidity, pursuing with admirable tact the precise path that his master had taken seaward Fleet-street, opposite Chancery-lane. Darting across the road then, he stopped with a low growl at the shop of Sweeney Todd, who suddenly opened the door, and aimed a blow at the dog with an iron bar, but the latter dexterously avoided it, and, but that the door was suddenly closed again, he would have made Sweeney Todd regret such an interference. 
               "We must inquire into this," said the captain; "there seems to be mutual ill-will between that man and the dog." 
               They both tried to enter the barber's shop, but it was fast on the inside; and, after repeated knockings, Todd called from within, saying,- 
               'I won't open the door while that dog is there. He is mad, or has a spite against me-I don't know or care which-it's a fact, that's all I am aware of." 
               "I will undertake," said the captain, "that the dog shall do you no harm; but open the door, for in we must come, and will." 
               "I will take your promise," said Sweeney Todd; "but mind you keep it, or I shall protect myself, and take the creature's life; so if you value it, you had better hold it fast." 
               The captain pacified Hector as well as he could, and likewise tied one end of a silk handkerchief round his neck, and held the other firmly in his grasp, after which Todd, who seemed to have some means form within of seeing what was going on, opened the door, and admitted his visitors. 
               "Well, gentlemen, shaved, or cut, or dressed, I am at your service; which shall I begin with?" 
               The dog never took his eyes off Todd, but kept up a low growl from the first moment of his entrance. 
               "It's rather a remarkable circumstance," said the captain, "But this is a very sagacious dog, you see, and he belongs to a friend of ours, who has most unaccountably disappeared." 
               "Has he really?" said Todd. "Tobias! Tobias!" 
               "Yes, sir." 
               "Run to Mr. Phillip's, in Cateaton-street, and get me six-pennyworth of figs." 
               "Yes," said the boy, with a shudder, for he had a great horror of Sweeney Todd, and away he went. 
               "Well, gentlemen," said Todd, "What is it you require of me?" 
               "We want to know if any one having the appearance of any officer in the navy came to your house?" 
               "Yes-a rather good-looking man, weather-beaten, with a bright blue eye, and rather fair hair." 
               "Yes, Yes! the same." 
               "Oh! to be sure, he came here, and I shaved him and polished him off." 
               "What do you mean by polishing him off?" 
               "Brushing him up a bit, and making him tidy; he said he had got some where to go in the city, and asked me the address of a Mr. Oakley, the spectacle-maker. I gave it him and then he went away; but as I was standing at my door about five minutes afterwards, it seemed to me, as well as I could see the distance, that he had got into some row near the market." 
               "Did this dog come with him?" 
               "A dog came with him, but whether it was that dog or not I don't know." 
               "And that's all you know of him?" 
               "You never spoke a truer word in your life," said Sweeney Todd, as he diligently stropped a razor upon his great horny hand. 
               This seemed something like a complete fix; and the captain looked at Colonel Jeffery, and the colonel at the captain, for some moments, in complete silence. At length the later said,- 
               "It is a very extraordinary thing that the dog should come here, if he missed his master somewhere else." 
               "So it is," said Todd, "but I dare say you will find him in the next watch-house." 
               The dog, during this brief dialogue, had watched the countenances of all the parties, and twice or thrice had uttered a strange howling cry. 
               "I'll tell you what it is," said the barber, "if that beast stays here I'll be the death of him. I hate dogs." 
               The dog, when he saw they were about to leave, grew furious, and it was with difficulty they got him out of the shop. They had proceeded but a short distance, when Hector got free of the handkerchief, and darting back sat down on Sweeney Todd's door, howling most piteously, and they had no resource but to leave him, intending to call as they came back form Mr. Oakley's. They walked on until they reached the spectacle-maker's when they recollected that the mission which Mr. Thornhill had to execute there was of a delicate nature, and probably was not mentioned at all in the hearing of Mr. Oakley; and as the captain was compelled to sail that night, Colonel Jeffery engaged to call at some future time, and also to take every means to obtain information in regard to the sudden disappearance of their friend Thornhill. 
               Hector would not stir an inch from the barber's door, but sat with the hat by his side, exhibiting a formidable row of teeth when any one showed a disposition to touch it. Sweeney Todd wished to leave the shop, and screwing his courage up to a sticking point, and arming himself with a long knife, ventured forth. 
               Hector did not fly at him, but with a melancholy expression of countenance looked up in his face whined piteously, as if he would have said, "Give me my master and I will forgive you.' 
               "Where's the dog's master," said one. 
               "I should not wonder if he had come to some foul end," said the barber. 
               "But I say, old soapsuds," cried a boy, "the dog says you done it." 
               "Does he? he is wrong then," said Todd, who having no desire to enter into a controversy with the people, turned again, and entering his shop, sat down and folded his gaunt-looking arms over his chest, and seemed lost in thought. 
             
             
               CHAPTER IV. 
               The Pie-shop-The Meeting in the Temple-The Conference and the fearful Narration in the Garden. 
               ON the left-hand side of Bell-yard, going from Carey-street, was at the time of which we write, one of the most celebrated shops for the sale of veal and pork pies that ever London produced. High and low, rich and poor, resorted to it: its fame had spread far and wide, and everybody frequented Lovett's pie-shop. Mrs Lovett was a buxom, young, good-looking widow, who pleased her customers, and done a thriving business. 
                
               It was here that Tobias obtained his noon-day meal, and as at this time the shop was full, and he had spent some time chatting with a companion, and knew that Sweeney Todd was a skilful calculator of the time it ought to take to go to different places, he ran as fast as he could to his master's shop. 
               There sat the mysterious dog with the hat, and Tobias lingered a moment to speak to him. 
               "Poor fellow!" said Tobias, "I wish I knew what had become of your master, but it made me shake like a leaf to wake up last night, and ask myself the question." 
               Tobias was about to enter the shop, when he thought he heard from within a strange sort of sound. On the impulse of the moment he recoiled a step or two, and then he dashed forward at once and entered the shop. The first thing he saw was a hat and beside it a gold-headed cane, lying upon the table. The shaving chair was vacant, and Sweeney Todd's face was just projecting into the shop from the back parlor, and wearing a most hideous appearance. 
               "Hark ye, Tobias!" he said, advancing and rubbing his hands, "so you have been to the pie-shop? Well, the only thing I can excuse upon an errand, is for you to get one of Lovett's pies; are they not delicious?" 
               "Yes, sir; but some gentleman seems to have left his hat and stick." 
               "Yes," said Sweeney Todd, and lifting the stick he struck the boy a blow that felled him to the floor. "Lesson the second to Tobias Ragg, which teaches him to make no remarks about what does not concern him." 
               "I won't endure it," cried the boy, "I won't be knocked about in this way." 
               "You won't have you forgotten your mother! my boy, a word in your ear. She stole a silver candlestick from Mr. King to pay her rent. I know it. I can prove it." 
               "Have mercy upon us! they would take her life!" 
               "To be sure they would! but be discreet, and you have nothing to fear." 
               "'Tis well; now go and put that hat and stick in yonder cupboard. I shall be absent a short time," and casting a withering look at the boy, he sailed forth into the street. 
                
               Poor Johanna Oakley! The 20th day of August has passed away, and brought with it no tidings of him you love; and oh! what a weary day. The next morning brought no rest to her troubled mind-an angry dispute between her father and mother relative to the Rev. Mr. Lupin, had not the effect to dispel her sadness, and she retired to her own room, which commanded a view of the street. As she looked listlessly around, she saw a stranger standing on the opposite side of the street, who, when he caught her eye, walked across and threw something on the balcony of the first floor. Johanna hastened to reach it, and with trembling eagerness opened the paper and read- 
               "For news of Mark Ingestrie come to the Temple gardens an hour before sunset, and do not fear addressing a man with a white rose in his hand." 
               "O! said she, as she placed the scrap of paper in her bosom, "that this messenger had come yesterday, what hours of anguish I should have been spared!" 
               Johanna was determined to be at the gardens in season, and full two hours before the time she tripped down the stairs of her father's house, and wended her way to the place appointed for the meeting. As she passed Sweeney Todd's shop, a feeling of curiosity prompted her to stop a moment and look at the melancholy dog that stood watching a hat at his door, and as she gazed, she saw the shop door gently opened, and a piece of meat thrown out. 
               "These are kind people," she said, "be they whom they may;" but when she saw the dog turn away with loathing, and herself observed that there was a white powder over it, the idea that it was poisoned, and when she saw the horrible looking face of Sweeney Todd glaring at her from the partially opened door, she could not doubt any further the fact; for that face was quite enough to give a warrant for any amount of villainy whatever-she passed on with a shudder, little suspecting that that dog had any thing to do with her fate. 
               It wanted a full hour to the appointed time of meeting when she reached the Temple gardens, and she sat down on one of the garden-seats to think over the past, and to recall to her memory with all the vivid freshness of young love's devotion. 
               The Temple clock struck the hour of meeting and Johanna looked anxiously around for any one who seemed to hear the appearance of being Mark Ingestrie's messenger. She turned her eyes towards a gentleman who was looking around as if in pursuit of some one, and when his eye fell upon her, he immediately produced from beneath his cloak a white rose. 
               "I have the honor," he said, "of speaking to Miss Johanna Oakley?" 
               "Yes, sir; and you are Mark Ingestrie's messenger?" 
               "I am; that is to say, I bring you news of Mark Ingestrie." 
               "Oh! sir, your looks are sad, as if some misfortune had occurred. Tell me that it is not so; speak to me at once, or my heart will break!" 
               "This is one of the saddest errands that I ever came upon. Compose yourself and listen." 
               "No! no! I know all now, and am desolate." 
               "There is much to hear, lady, and though I cannot tell you that Mark Ingestrie lives, I cannot surely tell you that he is dead!" 
               "There is a hope, then! Oh! say there is hope!" 
               "It may be. You are aware under what circumstances Mark went abroad?" 
               "I only knew that a quarrel with his uncle, Mr. Grant, was the principal cause, and that he had a desire to better his fortunes, so that we might be happy and independent." 
               "I have not time to give you all the particulars. He associated himself with a gentleman named Thornhill, who ought himself to have made you this communication, but by some strange accident, has been prevented." 
               "And he was to have come to me yesterday?" 
               "He was." 
               "Then Mark Ingestrie kept his word. Go on, sir." 
               "A vessel was duly chartered and manned for a voyage to the Indian seas, in search of treasure." 
               "It was a gallant vessel," said the maiden. "I saw it many a mile from England, before it sunk beneath the waves, to rise no more." 
               "Yes, it was an ill fated ship, and it did sink. It was evening, and the sun had sunk beneath the horizon, with some appearance that betokened a storm. We did not except any thing serious-yet we made every preparation, and it was well we did; for never before did such a storm ravish the coast. The gale drove us out of our course, and just as the storm, which lasted two days and three nights, began to abate, we saw a dull, red light, and as it was not in that quarter of the sky where any such appearance might be imagined, we steered towards it, surmising what afterwards proved correct." 
               "It was a ship on fire!" said Johanna. 
               "It was." 
               "Alas! alas! I guessed it. And that ship was--" 
               "The Star was bound upon its adventurous course, although driven far out of it by adverse winds and waves. After about half an hour's sailing, we came within sight distinctly of a blazing vessel. We could hear the roar of the flames, and through our glasses we could see them curling up the cordage, and dancing from mast to mast. We made all sail, and strained every inch of canvas, to reach the ill-fated vessel; but that vessel was doomed. The fiat had gone forth that it was to be among the things that had been, and long before we could reach the spot upon which it floated idly on the now comparatively calm waters, we saw a bright shower of sparks rush up into the air. Then came a loud roaring sound over the surface of the deep and was still-the ship had disappeared, and the water closed over it forever." 
               "But," said Johanna, "how knew you that the ship was the Star?" 
               "I will tell you: although we had seen the ship go down, we kept on our course, straining every effort to reach the spot, with the hope of picking up some of the crew, who surely had made an effort by the boats, to leave the burning vessel. The captain of the Indiaman kept his glass at his eye, and presently he said to me, 'There is a floating piece of wreck, and something clinging to it. I know not if there be a man; but what I can perceive, seems to be the head of a dog.' I looked through the glass myself, and saw the same object; but as we neared it, we found that it was a large piece of the wreck, with a dog and a man supported by it, who were clinging with all the energy of desperation. In ten minutes more, we had them on board the vessel-the man was the Lieutenant Thornhill I have before mentioned, and the dog belonged to him. He related to us that the ship we had seen burning, was the Star, and that it had never reached its destination, and he believed all had perished but himself and the dog; for, although one of the boats had been launched, so desperate a rush was made into it by the crew, that it had swamped, and all perished. Such was his own state of exhaustion, that after he had made this short statement, it was some days before he left his hammock; but when he did, and began to mingle with us, we found an intelligent, cheerful companion-such a one, indeed as we were glad to have on board, and in confidence he related to the captain and myself the object of the voyage of the Star. And then, during a night-watch, when the soft and beautiful moonlight was more than usually inviting, and he and I were on the deck, enjoying the coolness of the night, after the intense heat of the day in the tropics, he said to me, 'I have a very sad mission to perform when I get to London. On board our vessel was a young man named Mark Ingestrie; and some short time before the vessel in which we were, went down, he begged of me to call upon a young lady named Johanna Oakley, the daughter of a spectacle-maker in London, providing I should be saved and he perish; and of the latter event, he felt so strong a presentiment, that he gave me a string of pearls, which I was to present to her in his name; but where he got them, I have not the least idea; for they are of immense value.' Mr. Thornhill showed me the pearls, which were of different sizes, roughly strung together, and when we reached the river Thames, which was only three days since, he left us with his dog, carrying his string of pearls with his, to find out where you reside." 
               "Alas! he never came." 
               "No; he disappeared somewhere about Fleet-street." 
               "Disappeared?" 
               "Yes; we can trace him to a barber's shop, kept by one Sweeney Todd; but beyond there, no information of him can be obtained; and what makes the affair more extraordinary is, that neither force nor persuasion can induce Thornhill's dog to leave the place." 
               "I saw the creature, and it looked imploringly, although kindly in my face; but little did I think that faithful animal held a part in my destiny." 
               "The course of true love never yet run smooth; wonder not, then, Johanna Oakley, that yours has suffered such a blight." 
               "I will go home and pray for strength to maintain my heart against this sad affliction." 
               "Shall I accompany you?" 
               Johanna felt grateful for the support of the gentlemen's arm-who was no other than Colonel Jeffery-and as they passed the barber's shop, they were surprised to see that the dog and hat were gone. 
                
               
                   
                     TOBIAS IN A FIX.-(See Chap. VII.) 
                  
                
             
             
               CHAPTER V. 
               Colonel Jeffery and his friend-Visit to the Barber. 
               COLONEL JEFFERY was not at all satisfied with the state of affairs, as regarded the disappearance of Mr. Thornhill, for whom he entertained a sincere regard, both on account of the private estimation in which he held him, and on account of actual service rendered to Thornhill by him. No to detain Johanna Oakley in the Temple-gardens, he had stopped his narrative, completely at the point when what concerned her had ceased, and had said nothing of much danger which the ship "Neptune" and its crew and passengers had gone through, after Mr. Thornhill had been taken on board with his dog. The fact is, the storm which he had mentioned, was only the first of a series of gales of wind that buffeted the ship about for some weeks, doing it much damage, and enforcing almost the necessity of putting in somewhere for repairs. Situated as the "Neptune" was, the nearest port at which they could at all expect assistance, was the British Colony at the Cape of Good Hope; but such was the contrary nature of the winds and waves, that just upon the evening of a tempestuous day, they found themselves bearing down close in shore, on the eastern coast of Madagascar. There was much apprehension that the vessel would strike on a rocky shore; but the water was deep, and the vessel rode well. There was a squall, and they let go both anchors to secure the vessel, as they were so close in shore, lest they should be driven in and stranded. It was fortunate they had so secured themselves; for the gale while it lasted, blew half a hurricane, and the ship lost some of her masts, and some other trifling damage, which however, entailed upon them the necessity of remaining there a few days, to cut timber, to repair their masts and to obtain supplies. There is but little to interest the general reader in the description of a gale. Order after order was given until the masts and spars went one by one, and then the order for clearing the wreck was given. There was much work to be done, and but little pleasure in doing it; for it was wet and miserable while it lasted, and there was the danger of being driven upon a lee shore, and knocked to pieces by the rocks. This danger was averted, and they anchored safe at a very short distance form the shore, in comparative security. 
               "We are safe now," remarked the captain, as he gave his second in command charge of the deck, and approached Mr. Thornhill and Colonel Jeffery. 
               "I am happy it is so," replied Jeffery. 
               "Well, captain," said Mr. Thornhill, "I am glad we have done with being knocked about; we are anchored, and the water here appears smooth enough, but it is rocky." 
               "What will you do now?" 
               "Stay here a day or two, and send boats ashore to cut pine trees, to refit the ship with masts." 
               "When you send ashore, will you permit me to accompany the boat's crew?" said Jeffery. 
               "Certainly; but the natives of this country are violent and intractable, and should you get into any row with them, there is every probability of your being captured, or some bodily injury done you." 
               "But I will take care to avoid all that." 
               "Very well, colonel, you shall be welcome to go." 
               "I must beg the same permission," said Mr. Thornhill; "for I should much like to see the country, as well as to have some acquaintance with the natives themselves." 
               "By no means trust yourself alone with them," said the captain; "for if you live, you will have cause to repent it-depend upon what I say." 
               "I will," said Thornhill' "I will go no where but where the boat's company goes." 
                
               The next morning, the boats were ordered out to go ashore with crews, prepared for cutting timber. With these boats Thornton and Colonel Jeffery went both of them on shore, and after a short ride, they reached the shore of Madagascar. It was a beautiful country, and one is which vegetables appear luxuriant and abundant, and the party in search of timber for shipbuilding purposes, soon came lordly monarchs of the forest, which would have made vessels of themselves. But this was not what was wanted; but where the trees grew thicker and taller, they began to cut some tall pine trees down. At first the natives were quiet and tractable enough, but anxious to see and inspect everything, being very inquisitive and curious. However, that was easily borne; but at length they became more numerous, and began to pilfer all they could lay their hands upon, which of course brought resentment, and after some time, a blow or two was exchanged. Colonel Jeffery was forward, and endeavoring to prevent some violence being offered to one of the woodcutters; in fact he was interposing himself between the contending parties ties, and tried to restore order and peace; but several armed natives rushed suddenly upon him, and were hurrying him away to death before any one could stir in his behalf. His doom appeared certain; for had they succeeded, they would have cruelly and brutally murdered him. However, just at that moment aid was at hand, and Mr. Thornhill, seeing how matters stood, seized a musket from one of the sailors, and rushed after the natives who had Jeffery. There were three of them-two others had gone on to apprise, it was presumed, the chiefs. When Mr. Thornhill arrived, they had thrown a blanket over the head of Jeffery; but Mr. Thornhill in an instant hurled one down with a blow from the butt-end of his musket, and the second met the same fate as he turned to see what was the matter. The third, seeing the colonel free, and the musket levelled at his own head, immediately ran after the other two, to avoid any serious consequences to himself. 
               "Thornhill, you have saved my life," said Colonel Jeffery, excitedly. 
               "Come away, don't stop here-to the ship! to the ship!" And as he spoke, they hurried after the crew; and they succeeded in reaching the boats and the ship in safety; congratulating themselves not a little upon so lucky an escape from a people quite warlike enough to do mischief, but not civilized enough to distinguish when to do it. 
               When men are far away from home, and in foreign lands, with the skies of other climes above them, their hearts become more closely knit together in those ties of brotherhood which certainly ought to actuate the whole universe, but which as certainly do not do so, except in very rare instances. One of these instances will be found, however, in the conduct of Colonel Jeffery and Mr. Thornhill, even under any circumstances, for they were most emphatically what might be termed kindred spirits; but when we come to unite to that fact the remarkable manner in which they had been thrown together, and the mutual services that they had it in their power to render to each other we should not be surprised at the almost romantic friendship that arose between them. It was then that Thornhill made the colonel's breast the depository of all his thoughts ensued between them, which, when it does take place between persons of really congenial dispositions, produces the most delightful results of human companionship. No one who has not endured the tedium of a sea voyage, can at all be aware of what a pleasant thing it is to have some one on board, in the rich stores of whose intellect and fancy one can find a never-ending amusement. The winds might now whistle through the cordage, and the waves toss the great ship on their foaming crests, still Thornhill and Jeffery were together, finding in the midst of danger, solace in each other's society, and each animating the other to the performance of deeds of daring that astonished the crew. The whole voyage was one of the greatest peril, and some of the oldest seamen on board did not scruple, during the continuance of their night watches, to intimate to their companions that the ship, in their opinion would never reach England, and that she would founder somewhere along the long stretch of the African coast. The captain, of course, made every possible exertion to put a stop to such matters, and there cannot be any reasonable doubt, but that some of the disasters that befel the Neptune on her homeward voyage from India, may be attributed to this feeling of fatality getting hold of the seamen, and inducing them to think that, let them try what they might, they could not save the ship. It happened that after they had rounded the Cape, a dense fog came on, such as had not been known on that coast for many a year, although the western shore of Africa at some seasons of the year is rather subject to such a species of vaporous exhalation. Every object was wrapped in the most profound gloom, and yet there was a strong eddy or current of the ocean, flowing parallel with the land, and as the captain hoped, rather off than on the shore. Still was a suspicion that the ship was making lee-way, which must eventually bring it on shore, by some of the low promontories that were by the maps indicated to be upon the coast. In consequence of this fear, the greatest anxiety prevailed on board the vessel, and lights were left burning on all parts of the deck, while two men were continually engaged in making soundings. It was about half-an-hour after midnight, as the chronometer indicated a storm, that suddenly the men, who were on watch on deck, raised a loud cry of dismay. They had suddenly seen close on to the larboard bow, lights which much belong to some vessel that like the Neptune, was encompassed in the fog, and a collision was quite inevitable, for neither ship had time to put about. The only doubt, which was a fearful and an agonizing one to have solved, was whether the strongest vessel was of sufficient bulk and power to run them down, or they it; and that fearful question was one which a few moments must settle. In fact, almost before the echo of that cry of horror which had come from the men, had died away, the vessels met. There was a hideous crash-one shriek of dismay and horror, and then all was still. The Neptune, with considerable damage, and some of her bulwarks stove in, sailed on; but the other ship went, with a surging sound to the bottom of the sea. Alas! nothing could be done. When the Neptune reached to obtain some information concerning the ill-fated ship that had met with so fearful a doom, and Colonel Jeffery resolved upon asking the opinion of a friend, likewise in the army, a Capt. Rathbone, concerning the whole of the facts. He met him with a most cordial and frank welcome, and, after sitting awhile with the family in the house, he and the captain strolled into the garden, and then Colonel Jeffery commenced his revelation. The captain, with very few interruptions, heard him to an end; and, when he concluded by saying- 
               "And now I am come to ask your advice upon all these matters." The captain immediately replied, in his warm, off hand manner: 
               "I am afraid you won't find my advice of much importance; but I offer you my active co-operation in any thing you think ought to be done or can be done in this affair, which I assure you, deeply interests me, and gives me the greatest possible impulse to exertion. You have but to command me in the matter, and I am completely at your disposal." 
               "I was quite certain you would say as much. But I am anxious to know what you really think with regard to what are, you will allow, most extraordinary circumstances." 
               "The most natural thing in the world," replied Mr. Rathbone; "at the first flush of the affair, it seemed to be, that we ought to look for your friend Thornhill at the point where he disappeared." 
               "At the barber's, in Fleet street?" 
               "Precisely. Did he leave the barber, or did he not?" 
               "Sweeney Todd says that he left him, and proceeded down the street, towards the city, in pursuance of a direction he had given him to Mr. Oakley, the spectacle-maker. Now the very fact that his dog could act in such a way, proclaims an amount of sagacity that seems to tell loudly against the presumption that such a creature could make any mistake." 
               "It does. What say you, now, to go into town to-morrow morning, and making a call at the barber's, without proclaiming we have any special errand, except to be shaved and dressed?" 
               After some more desultory conversation on the subject, it was agreed that they should both start for London in the morning, and make some attempts by talking about jewels and precious stones, to draw the barber into a confession that he had something of the sort to dispose of. Accordingly they proceeded to London, walked towards Fleet street, and were soon at the shop of Sweeney Todd. 
                
               "The dog, you perceive, is not here," said the colonel-"that rascally barber has killed him." 
               "Shaved and dressed gentlemen!" said Sweeney Todd, as his customers made their appearance. "Pray be seated. I'll soon polish off one of you, and then begin upon the other." 
               "Thank you." 
               "Now," said Todd, removing the cloth, "I believe you are as clean shaved as ever you were in your life." 
               "Why, yes; and now Mr. Green"-addressing the colonel by that name-"we must be quick, or we shall be late for the duke, and so lose the sale of some of our jewels.' 
               "Jewel merchants, gentlemen, I presume," said Sweeney Todd. 
               "Yes, we have been in that line some time." 
               "Well," said Sweeney Todd, "dealing in jewels is better than shaving." 
               "I dare say it is." 
               "There you are, gentlemen," said the barber, "shaved with a celerity you seldom meet with, and that for one penny-thank you-there's your change. Good morning." 
               They had no 
                     resource
                     recourse
                   but to leave the shop, and when they had gone, Sweeney, as he stropped the razor, gave a most diabolical grin, muttering: 
               "Clever-very ingenious-but it won't do. I am not so easily taken in. Diamond merchants-ah! ha! and no objections to deal in pearls. If I had been accustomed to be easily detected, I had not been here a living man." 
             
             
               CHAPTER VI. 
               The Stranger of Lovett's. 
               TOWARDS the dusk of the evening, after the last batch of pies had been disposed of, there walked into the shop of Mrs. Lovett, a man most miserably clad, who stood for a few moments staring with weakness and hunger at the counter. 
               Mrs. Lovett was there; but there was no smile for him, and she forestalled what the man had to say. 
               "Go away! we never give anything to beggars." 
               A flush of color came across the features of the stranger, as he replied: 
               "I do not come to ask alms of you, but to know if you can recommend me to any employment." 
               "Recommend a ragged wretch like you?" 
               "I am a ragged wretch, and moreover quite destitute; but in better times I have sat at your counter, and then one of your sweetest smiles has been at my disposal." 
               "Oh, yes, and then when you get in better case again, you will have sufficient insolence to make you unbearable; besides, what employment can we have but pie-making, and we have a man now who suits us very well, with the exception that he has grown insolent, and fancies himself master of the place." 
               "Of course," said the stranger, "there is always sufficient argument against the poor and destitute to keep them so." 
               He turned and was about to leave the shop; but Mrs. Lovett called after him: 
               "Come in again in two hours." 
               "I will," said he, turning his emaciated countenance upon her, "if my strength permit me-water from the pumps in the street, is but a poor thing for a man to subsist upon for twenty-four hours." 
                
               "You may take one pie." 
               The miserable looking man seized upon a pie and devoured it in an instant. 
               "My name," he said, "is Jarvis Williams; I'll be here." 
               "He might suit," said Mrs. Lovett, in a low tone, "for a few months, like the rest, and its clear we must get rid of the one we now have." 
               Away down beneath the pavement of Bell Yard, there is a cellar of vast extent, and of dim and sepulchral aspect. Here and there gleaming lights seem to be peeping out from furnaces, and there is a strange hissing, simmering sound going on, while the whole air is impregnated with a rich savory vapor. This is Lovett's pie manufactory, and each night a batch of some thousands are made, to be sent the first thing in the morning, all over the suburbs of London. there were a number of doors in different directions, and singularly low-arched vaults, which all appear black as midnight. There is but one man, too, throughout all that place, and he is sitting on a low three-legged stool in one corner, with his head resting upon his hands, as he utters audible moans. It seems astonishing that such a man, even with the assistance of Mrs. Lovett, could make so many pies as are required in a day; but system does wonders, and in those cellars there are various mechanical contrivances for chopping up the meat, kneading the dough, &c. But what a miserable object is that man! A more perfect picture of horror could not have been found. 
               "I must leave to-night," he said in sad accents. "I know too much-my brain is full of horrors. I have not slept now for five nights; nor dare I eat anything but the raw flour. Oh! if I could but get into the street!" 
               He rose and walked toward one of the doors. 
               "All the doors are fastened upon me," he said. "What can it mean? Six weeks only I have been here. I was starving when I came. Alas! how much better to have starved!" 
               He resumed his former position, with his head resting upon his hands. One of the small arch doors opened, and a man, half-masked, carrying a heavy, double headed mallet, cautiously entered and looked round the vault till he saw the crouched up figure whose duty it was to attend the ovens. He advances stealthily toward him-he comes nearer and nearer-slowly, but surely, The mallet descends-one shriek! and without a groan, the poor oven-tender fell lifeless. 
                
               "And so, Mr. Jarvis Williams, you have kept your word," said Mrs. Lovett to the emaciated, care-worn stranger, "and come for employment?" 
               "I have, madam, and hope you can give it to me." 
               "Well, I don't see why we should not make a trial of you; so if you will go down into the bakehouse, I will follow, and show you what you have to do. You must remember that you have to live entirely upon the pies, and you must likewise agree never to leave the bakehouse, unless you leave it for good. If upon these conditions you choose to accept the situation, you may, and if not, you can go about your business." 
               "Alas! madam, I have no resource; but you spoke of having a man." 
               "Yes, but he has gone to his friends. Are you willing or not to take the situation?" 
               "My poverty and destitution consent, if my will be averse; but of course, understand that I leave when I please." 
               "Oh, of course. We never think of keeping anybody after they become uncomfortable." 
               Williams and Mrs. Lovett now descended to the vault which we have briefly 
                     desbribed
                     described
                  . 
               "These," said she, "are the ovens, and I will show you how you can manufacture the pies and feed the furnaces. Flour will always be let down through a trap-door, from the upper shop, as well as every thing required for making the pies, but the meat. That you will always find ranged upon shelves, either in lumps or steaks, in a small room through this door; but it is only at particular times you will find the door open, and when you do, you had better take out what meat you may require for the next batch." 
               "I understand it; but how does the meat get there?" 
               "That's no business of yours, so long as you are supplied with it. I will now go through the process of making one pie, so that you may know how to proceed." 
               She then showed him how a piece of meat thrown into a machine, became finely minced up, by merely turning a handle, and then how flour and water and lard were mixed up together, to make the crust of the pies by another machine, which threw out the paste in small pieces, each just large enough for a pie. Lastly, she showed him how a tray, which just held a hundred, could be filled, and by turning a windlass, sent up to the shop through a square trap door. 
               "And now I must leave you. As long as you are industrious you will get on well, but if you begin to be idle and neglect my orders, you will get a piece of information which will enable you to know what you are about." 
               "What is that? you may as well give it to me now.' 
               "No; we seldom find occasion for it at first, but after a time, when you get well fed, you are pretty sure to want it." 
               So saying she left the place, and he heard the door by which he had entered carefully barred after her. Suddenly then he heard her voice again, and so clear and distinctly too, that he thought she must have come back; but upon looking up at the door he found that it arose from her speaking through a small grating at the upper part of it. 
               "Remember your duty," she said, "and I warn you that any attempt to leave here will be as futile as it is dangerous." 
               "Except with your consent when I relinquish the situation." 
               "Oh, certainly-everybody who relinquishes the situation goes to his old friends." 
               "What a singular mode of talking she has! there seems to be some hidden meaning in every word she utters; and what a singular looking place this is!" 
               "Is it possible," he continued, "that I am able to make such delicious pies! At any rate one can't starve here, and if it be a kind of imprisonment, it's a pleasant one. Upon my soul they are nice. I don't know where Mrs. Lovett gets her meat, but it's as tender as young chickens, and the fat actually melts in one's mouth. I have no friends and no money; she whom I loved is faithless, and here I am, master of as many pies as I like, and to all appearance monarch of all I survey. To be sure, my kingdom is rather a gloomy one, but then I can abdicate it when I am tired of these delicious pies, and go somewhere else, and in the meantime I will make and eat pies as fast as I can." 
             
             
               CHAPTER VII.  
               Tobias's Retreat, and its Consequences. 
               PERHAPS one of the most pitiable objects now in our history is poor Tobias, Sweeney Todd's boy, who certainly had his suspicions aroused in the most terrific manner, but he was terrified by the threats of what the barber was capable of doing against his mother, from making any disclosures. The effect upon his personal appearance of this wear and tear of his intellect was striking and manifest. The hue of youth and health entirely departed from his cheeks, and he looked so sad and careworn, that it was quite a terrible thing to look upon a young lad so, as it were, upon the threshold of existence, and in whom anxious thoughts were making such war upon the physical energies. His cheeks were pale and sunken; his eyes had an unnatural brightness about them, and, to look upon his lips, one would think they had never parked in a smile for many a day, so sadly were they compressed together. He seemed ever to he watching likewise for something fearful, and even as he walked the streets he would frequently turn and look inquiring around him with a shudder as if afraid. Oppressed with doubts, fears, and all sorts of dreadful thoughts, he sits moody and alone, and in the position which he always assumes when Sweeney Todd is from home-that is to say, with his head resting on his hands, and looking the picture of melancholy abstraction. 
               "What shall I do?" he said to himself,-"what will become of me? I think if I live here any certain of it, and I wish to say so, but I dare not for my mother's sake. Alas! alas! the end of it will be, that he will kill me, or that I shall go out of my senses, and then I shall die in some mad house, and no one will care what I say." 
               The boy wept bitterly after he had uttered these melancholy reflections, and he felt his tears something of a relief to him, so that he looked up after a little time, and glanced around him. 
               "What a strange thing?" he said, "that people should come into this shop, to my certain knowledge, who never go out of it again, and yet what becomes of them I cannot tell." 
               He looked with a shuddering anxiety towards the parlor, the door of which Sweeney Todd took care to lock always when he left the place, and he thought he should like much to have a thorough examination of that room. 
               "I have been in it," he said, "and it seems full of cupboards and strange holes and corners, such as I never saw before, and there is an odd stench in it that I cannot make out at all; but it's out of the question thinking of ever being in it above a few minutes at a time, for Sweeney Todd takes good care of that." 
               The boy rose, and opened a small cupboard that was in the shop. It was perfectly empty. 
               "Now, that's strange," he said, "there was a walking-stick with an ivory top to it here just before he went out, and I could swear it belonged to a man who came in to be shaved. More than once-ah! and more than twice, too, when I have come in suddenly, I have seen people's hats, and Sweeney Todd would try and make me believe that people go away after being shaved, and leave their hats behind them." 
               He walked up to the shaving chair as it was called, which was a large old fashioned piece of furniture, made of oak, and carved; and as the boy threw himself into it, he said- 
               "What an odd thing it is that this chair is screwed so tight to the floor! Here is a complete fixture, and Sweeney Todd says it is so, because it's in the best possible light, and if we were not to make it fast in such a way, the customers would shift, it about from place to place, so that he could not conveniently shave them; it may be true but I don't know." 
               "And you have your doubts," said the voice of Sweeney Todd, as that individual, with a noiseless step, walked into the shop-"you have your doubts, Tobias? I shall have to cut your throat, that is quite clear." 
               "No, no, have mercy upon me; I did not mean what I said." 
               "Then its uncommonly imprudent to say it, Tobias. Do you remember that I can hang your mother when I please." 
               "I cannot forget-I do not forget." 
               "'Tis well; and mark me, I will not have you assume such an aspect as you wear, when I am not here. You don't look cheerful, Tobias; and, notwithstanding this excellent situation, with little to do, and the number of Lovett's pies you eat, you fall away." 
               "I cannot help it," said Tobias, "since you told me what you did concerning my mother. I have been so anxious that I cannot help--" 
               "Why should you be anxious? Her preservation depends upon yourself, and upon yourself wholly. You have but to keep silent, and she is safe; but if you utter one word that shall be displeasing to me about my affairs, mark me Tobias, she comes to the scaffold; and if I cannot conveniently place you in the same mad-house where the last boy I had was placed, I shall certainly be under the troublesome necessity of cutting your throat." 
               "I will be silent-I will say nothing, Mr. Todd, I know I shall die soon, and then you will get rid of me altogether, and I don't care how soon that may be, for I am quite weary of my life-I shall be glad when it is over." 
               "Very good," said the barber; "that's all a matter of taste. And now, Tobias, I desire that you look cheerful and smile, for a gentleman is outside feeling his chin with his hand, and thinking he may as well come in and be shaved. I may want you, Tobias, to go to Billingsgate and bring a pennyworth of shrimps." 
               "Yes," thought Tobias, with a groan-"yes, while you murder him." 
             
             
               CHAPTER VIII. 
               Disappearance of Tobias-His Recapture by Todd, and what becomes of him. 
               SWEENEY TODD had been for the most part of his life aiming at the possession of extensive pecuniary resources, and with such a man no question of morality or ordinary feeling could arise, and there can be no doubt that he would quite willingly have sacrificed the whole human race, if by so doing he could achieve the objects of his ambition. By the aid of a superior intellect, and a mind full of craft and design, he had managed to make others subservient to his views; and now that those views were answered, and that his underlings and accomplices were no longer required, they became positively dangerous. He was' well aware of that cold-blooded policy which teaches that it is far safer to destroy than to cast away the tools by which a man carves his way to power and fortune. 
               "They shall die," said Sweeney Todd-"dead men tell no tales, nor women nor boys either, and they shall all die; after which there will, I think, be a serious fire in Fleet-street. Ha! ha! it may spread to what mischief it likes, always provided it stops not short of the entire destruction of my house and premises. Rare sport-rare sport will it be to me, for then I will at once commence a new career, in which the barber will be forgotten, and the man of fashion only seen and remembered, for I am fully capable of vying with the highest and the noblest, let them be whom they may." 
               This seemed a pleasant train of reflections to Sweeney Todd, and as he entered Fleet-street, there sat such a grim smile upon his countenance, that he looked like some fiend in human shape: Tobias was not in the shop when he entered, and having fastened the door securely, he took the light in his hands, and ascended to the upper part of his house-that is to say, the first floor, where alone anything was to be found. He saw at once the open bureau, with all its glittering display of jewels, and as he gazed upon the heap, he muttered- 
               "I have not so accurate a knowledge of what is here as to be able to say if any thing be extracted or not, but I know the amount of money, if I do not know the precise number of jewels which this bureau contains." 
                
               He opened a small drawer which had entirely escaped the scrutiny of Tobias, and proceeded to count a large number of guineas which were there. 
               "These are correct," he said, when he had finished his examination-"these are correct, and he has touched none of them." 
               He opened another drawer, in which were a great many packets of silver done up in paper, and these likewise he carefully counted, and was satisfied they were right. 
               "It is strange," he said, "he has taken nothing, but yet perhaps it is better that it should be so, inasmuch as it shows a wholesome fear of me. The slightest examination would have shown him these hoards of money; and since he has not made that slight examination, nor discovered any of them, it seems to my mind decisive upon the subject, that he has taken nothing, and perchance I shall discover him easier than imagine." 
               He fastened up his house and sallied forth, taking his way direct to Mrs. Ragg's humble home, in the expectation that there he would hear something of Tobias. When he reached Mrs Ragg's house, and made his appearance abruptly before that lady, who seemed somehow or another to be always ironing and always, to drop the iron when any one came in, very near their toes, he said- 
               "Where did your son Tobias go after he left you to-night?" 
               "Lor! Mr. Todd, is it you? You are as good as a conjuror, sir, for he was here; but bless you, sir, I know no more where he is gone to, than the man in the moon. He said he was going to sea, but I am sure I should not have thought it, that I should not." 
               "To sea!-then the probability is that he would go down to the docks, but surely not to-night. Do you not expect him back here to sleep?" 
               "Well, sir, that's a very good thought of yours, and he may come back here to sleep, for all I know it for all I know to the contrary." 
               "But you do not know it for a fact?" 
               "He didn't say so; but he may come, you, know, sir, for all that." 
               "Did he tell you his reason for leaving me?" 
               "Indeed no, sir; he really did not, and he seemed to me to be a little bit out of his senses." 
               "Ah! Mrs. Ragg," said Sweeney Todd, "there you have it. From the first moment that he came into my service, I knew and felt confident that he was out of his senses, and I am only anxious about him, in order that some effort may be made to cure him of such a malady, for it is a serious and a dreadful one, and one which, unless taken in time, will yet be the death of Tobias." 
               These words were spoken with such solemn seriousness, that they had a wonderful effect upon Mrs. Ragg, who, like most ignorant persons, began immediately to confirm that which she most dreaded. 
               "Oh, it's too true," she said, "it's too true. He did say some extraordinary strange things to-night, Mr. Todd, and he said he had something to tell, which was too horrid to speak of. Now the idea, you know, Mr. Todd, of anybody having anything at all to tell, and not telling it at once, is quite singular." 
               "It is!-and I am sure that his conduct is such you never would be guilty of, Mrs. Ragg; but hark! what's that?" 
               "It's a knock, Mr. Todd." 
               "Hush, stop a moment-what if it be Tobias?" 
               "Gracious goodness! it can't be him, for he would have come in at once." 
               "No; I slipped the bolt of the door, because I wished to talk to you without observation. But let me hide somewhere, so that I may hear what he says, and be able to judge how his mind is effected. I will not hesitate to do something for him, let it cost what it may." 
               "There's the cupboard, Mr. Todd. To be sure there is some dirty sauce-pans pans and a frying-pan in it, and of course it aint no place to ask you to go into." 
               "Never mind that-never mind that; only you be careful, for the sake of Tobias's very life, to keep secret that I am here." 
               The knocking at the door increased each moment in vehemence, and scarcely had Sweeney Todd succeeded in getting into the cupboard, when she opened the door; and, sure enough-Tobias, heated, tired and looking ghastly pale-staggered into the room. 
               "Mother," he said, "I have taken a new thought, and have come back to you." 
               "Well I thought you would, Tobias; and a very good thing it is that you have." 
               "Listen to me: I thought flying from England forever, and of never again setting foot upon its shores. I have altered that determination completely, and I feel now that it is my duty to do something else." 
               "To do what, Tobias?" 
               "To tell all I know-to make a clean breast, mother, and let the consequences be what they may, to let justice take its course." 
               "What do you mean, Tobias?" 
               "Mother, I have come to a conclusion, that what I have to tell is of such vast importance, compared with any consequences that may arise from the petty robbery of the candlestick, which you know of, that I ought not to hesitate a moment in revealing every thing." 
               "But, my dear Tobias, remember that is a dreadful secret, and one that must be kept." 
               "It was long ago, and the prosecutor may have mercy; but be all that how it may, and be the consequences what they may, I must and will tell what I now know." 
               "But what is it Tobias, that you know?" 
               "I know that I am half mad, mother; but yet I know what I am saying well. So do not fancy that it is not to be relied upon; but go and fetch some one at once, to listen to what I have to relate." 
               "Perhaps," thought Mrs. Ragg, "if I were to pretend to humor him, it would be as well, and while I am gone, Mr. Todd can speak to him." 
               "Well, my dear, if it must be, it must be, and I will go; but I hope while I have gone, somebody will speak to you, and convince you that you ought to try and quiet yourself." 
               These words Mrs. Ragg uttered aloud, for the special benefit of Sweeney Todd, who she considered, would have been there to take the hint accordingly. It is needless to say he did hear them, and how far he profited by them, we shall quickly perceive. 
               "What shall I do?" said Sweeney Todd to himself. "Shall I await his mother's coming again, and get her to aid me, or shall I of myself adopt some means which will put an end to trouble on this boy's account?" 
               "He is a murderer," said Tobias. "I know he is, although I have never seen him do the deed, or seen any appearance in the shop, of a deed of blood having been committed. Yet why is it that occasionally when a better dressed person than usual comes into the shop, that he sends me out on some errand to a distant part of the town?" 
               "What a relief," muttered Sweeney, as he slowly opened the door, unseen by Tobias. "What a relief it will be to me when this boy is in his grave, as he will be soon, or else I have forgotten all my moral learning, and turned chicken-hearted-neither of them very likely circumstances." 
               "I shall at length," murmured Tobias, "be free from my present dreadful state of mind, by thus accusing Todd. He is a murdered! of that I have no doubt; it is but a duty of mine to stand forward as his accuser." 
               Sweeney Todd stretched out his two brawny hands, and clutched Tobias by the head, which he turned round till the boy could see him, and then he said: 
               "Indeed Tobias! and did it never strike you that Todd was not so easily to be overcome as you would wish him, eh, Tobias?" 
               The shock of this astonishing and sudden appearance of Sweeney Todd was so great, that for a few moments Tobias was deprived of all power of speech or action, and with his head so strangely twisted as to seem to threaten the destruction of his neck. If one thing more than another is calculated to delight such a man as Todd, it certainly was to perceive what a dreadful effect his presence had upon Tobias, who remained about a minute and a half in this state, before he ventured upon a shriek, which however, when it did come, almost frightened Todd himself. 
               "Such another cry, and it is the last you ever live to utter, although it cover me with difficulties to escape the charge of killing you. Peace! I say peace!" 
               This exhortation was quite needless; for Tobias could not have uttered a word, had he been ever so much inclined to do so. The barber held his throat with such an iron clutch, as if it had been in a vice. 
               "Villain!" growled Todd, "villain! so this is the way in which you have dared to disregard my injunctions. But no matter-no matter! You shall have plenty of leisure to reflect upon what you have done for yourself. Fool! to think that you could cope with me-Sweeney Todd! Ha! ha!" 
               "So, he has fainted, has he? Dull child! that is all the better. For once in a way, Tobias, I will carry you-not to oblige you; but to oblige myself." 
               He took Tobias up as easily as if he had been an infant, and strode through the Temple, carrying the boy, who seemed not at all in a hurry to recover from the nervous state of suffocation into which he had fallen. As they passed through the gate opening into Fleet street, the porter, who knew the barber well by sight, said; 
               "Hilloa, Mr. Todd! Is that you? Why, what are you carrying?" 
               "Yes it's I," said Todd, "and I am carrying my apprentice boy, Tobias Ragg, poor fellow." 
               "Poor fellow! why, what's the matter with him?" 
               "I can hardly tell you; but he seems to me and to his mother to have gone out of his senses. Good night to you; good night. "Jarvey," he said to an coachman, "what will you take me to Peckham Rye for?" 
               "Peckman Rye! you and the boy? I will take you for twelve shillings." 
               "I'll give you half the amount," said Sweeney Todd. 
               "Half, master? that is cutting low; but get in. I must try and make it up by some better fare." 
               The barber got into the vehicle, carrying Tobias with him, apparently with great care and consideration; but when the coach-door closed, he flung him down in the straw, at the bottom of the vehicle, and resting his immense feet upon him, he gave one of his disagreeable laughs, as he said: 
               "Well, I think I have you now, master Tobias; your troubles will soon be over. I am really very much afraid that you will die suddenly, and then there will be an end of you altogether, which will be a very sad thing-though I don't think I shall go into mourning; because that only keeps alive the bitterness of regret." 
               Sweeney Todd directed the coachman to take the road to the left, which they pursued for the distance of about a mile and a half. There was a lonely, old-looking house by the way-side surrounded by a high wall, and here the barber directed the coachman to stop, got out himself and rung the bell, the handle of which hung invitingly at the gate. A noise proceeded from within, as if several bars and bolts had been withdrawn; and presently the door opened and a huge, rough-looking man made his appearance on the threshold. 
               "Well! what is it now?" he cried. 
               "I have a patient for Mr. Fogg," said the barber. 
               "Oh! well, the more the merrier; it don't matter to me a bit. Have you got him with you, and is he quiet?" 
               "It's a mere boy and he is not violently mad, but very decidedly so as regards what he says." 
               "Oh! that's it, is it? He can say what he likes here; it can make no difference in the world to us. Bring him in. Mr. Fogg is in his own room." 
               "I know the way; you take charge of the lad, and I will go and speak to Mr. Fogg about him. But stay-give the coachman these six shillings and discharge him." 
               The doorkeeper of the lunatic asylum, for such it was, went out to obey the injunctions of Sweeney Todd, while that rascally individual himself walked along a wide passage to the door, which was at the further extreme of it. 
             
             
               CHAPTER 
                     VIII.
                     IX.
                  
                
               The Mad-house Cell. 
               WHEN the porter of the mad-house went out to the coach, his first impression was, that the boy was dead; he lay still at the bottom of the coach, alike insensible to joy or sorrow. 
               "Is he dead?" said man to the coachman. 
               "How should I know?" was the reply; "he may be or he may not; but I want to know how long I am to wait here for my fare." 
               "There is your money; be off with you. I can see now that the boy is all right; for he breathes-although it is after an odd fashion that he does so. I should rather think he had a knock in the head, or something of that kind." 
               As he spoke, he conveyed Tobias within the building. When Sweeney Todd reached the door at the end of the passage, he tapped at it with his knuckles, and a voice cried: 
               "Who knocks-who knocks? curses on you all! Who knocks?" 
               Sweeney Todd did not make any verbal reply to this polite request; but opening the door, he walked into apartment. 
               Mr. Fogg, the mad-house keeper, fixed eyes from beneath his shaggy brows upon Sweeney Todd, as the latter entered his apartment, and then he said: 
               "Mr. Todd, I think, unless my memory deceives me." 
               "The same," said the barber, making a hideous face, "I believe I am not easily forgotten." 
               "True," said Mr. Fogg, as he reached a book the edge of which was cut into a lot of little slips, on each of which was a capital letter, in the order of the alphabet-"true, you are not easily forgotten, Mr. Todd." 
               He then opened the book at the letter T. and read from it: 
               "Mr. Sweeney Todd, Fleet-street, London, paid one year's keep and burial of Thomas Simpkins, aged fifteen, found dead in his bed, after a residence in the asylum of ten months and four days. I think Mr. Todd, that was our last little transaction. What can I do now for you sir?" 
               "I am rather unfortunate," said Todd, "with my boys. I have got another here, who has shown such decided symptoms of insanity, that it becomes absolutely necessary to place him under your care." 
                
               "Indeed! Does he rave?" 
               "Why, yes he does, and it's the most absurd nonsense in the world that he raves about; for, to hear him, one would really think that, instead of being one of the most humane of men, I was, in point of fact, an absolute murderer." 
               "A murderer, Mr. Todd?" 
               "Yes, a murderer-a murderer to all intents and purposes. Could anything be more absurd than such an accusation? I that have the milk of human kindness flowing in every vein, and whose very appearance ought to be sufficient to convince anybody at once of my kindness of disposition." 
               "For how long," said the mad-house keeper, "do you think this malady will continue?" 
               "I will pay," said Sweeney Todd, as he leaned over the table, and looked in the face of his questioner, "I will pay for twelve months; but I don't think, between you and I, that the case will last anything like so long. I think he will die suddenly." 
               "I shouldn't wonder if he did. Some of our patients do die very suddenly, and somehow or other, we never know exactly how it happens. We make no remarks and we ask no questions." 
               Both now proceeded to what was called a reception-room, in the asylum, and where poor Tobias had been conveyed and laid upon a table. 
               "Quite young," said the mad-house keeper, as he looked upon the pale and interesting face of Tobias. 
               "Yes," said Sweeney Todd, "he is young, and more's the pity, and of course, we deeply regret his present situation." 
               "Oh, of course, of course; but see, he opens his eyes, and will speak directly." 
               "Rave-you mean rave!" said Todd. "Don't call it speaking; it is not entitled to the name. Hush! Listen to him." 
               "Where am I?" said Tobias. "Where am I? Todd is a murderer. I denounce him." 
               "You hear; you hear?" said Todd. 
               "Mad indeed," said the keeper. 
               "Oh, save me from him-save me from him!" said Tobias, fixing his eyes upon Mr. Fogg. "Save me from him; it is my life he seeks, because I know his secrets. He is a murderer, and many a person comes into his shop, who never leave it again in life, if at all." 
               "You hear him?" said Todd. "Was there ever anybody so mad?" 
               "No, no," said Tobias, "I am not mad. Why call me mad, when the truth or falsehood of what I say, can be ascertained so easily? Search Sweeney Todd's, and if those things be not found there, say that I am mad, and have but dreamed of them. I do not know how he kills the people. That is a great mystery to me; but that he does kill them, I have no doubt." 
               "Watson?" cried the mad-house keeper. Hilloa! here, Watson, take this lad, as he seems extremely feverish and unsettled. You will take him and shave his head, Watson, and put a straight waistcoat upon him, and let him be put in one of the dark cells. We must be careful of him, and too much light encourages delirium and fever." 
               The man named Watson, seized upon Tobias, who again uttered a shriek something similar to the one which had come from his lips when Sweeney Todd clutched hold of him in his mother's room. But they were used to such things in that mad-house, and cared little for them-so no one heeded the cry in the least; but poor Tobias was carried to the door, half maddened in reality by the horrors that surrounded him. Just as he was being conveyed out, Sweeney Todd stepped up to him, and putting his mouth close up to his ear, he whispered: 
                
               "Ha! ha! Tobias! how do you feel now? Do you think Sweeney Todd will be hung, or will you die in the cell of a mad-house?" 
               Poor Tobias, in conformity with the orders that had been issued with regard to him, was conveyed along a number of winding passages, and down several stair-cases, towards the cells of the establishment. In vain he struggled to get free from his captor. As well might a hare have struggled in the fangs of a wolf; nor were his cries at all heeded-although now and then, the shrieks he uttered, were terrible to hear, and enough to fill any one with dismay. 
               "I am not mad," said he; "indeed I am not mad. Let me go, and I will say nothing; not one word shall ever pass my lips regarding Mr. Todd. Let me go; oh, let me go, and I will pray for you as long as I life." 
               Mr. Watson whistled a lively tune. 
               "If I promise-if I swear to tell nothing, Mr. Todd will not wish me kept here. All he wants, is my silence, and I will take any oath he likes. Speak to him, I implore you, and let me go." 
               ""There," said Watson, "my lad, you can stay there and make yourself comfortable till somebody comes to shave your head, and after that, you will find yourself quite a gentleman." 
               "Mercy! mercy-have mercy upon me!" 
               "Mercy! What the devil do you mean by mercy? Well, that's a good joke; but I can tell you, you have come to the wrong shop for that. We don't keep it in stock here, and if we wanted ever so little of it, we should have to go somewhere else for it." 
               Tobias lay upon his back on the cell, wringing his hands despairingly, feeling that almost already the very atmosphere of that place seemed pregnant with insanity, and giving himself up for lost entirely. 
               "I shall never-never," he said "look upon the bright sky and the green fields again. I shall be murdered here, because I know too much. Oh! heaven! what will become of me? I feel already stifled and sick, and faint with the air of this dreadful cell. Help, help, help! have mercy upon me, and I will do anything-promise anything-swear anything." 
               If poor Tobias had uttered his complaints on the most desolate shore that ever a shipwrecked mariner was cast upon, they could not have been more unheeded than they were in that house of terror. He screamed and shrieked for aid-a cold and clammy perspiration broke out upon him-in vain he covered his eyes with his hands; those creatures of his imagination were not to be shut out from the mind, and he saw them, if possible, more vividly than before, and presenting themselves in more frightfully tangible shapes. Truly, if such feelings should continue to haunt him poor Tobias was likely enough to follow the fate of many others who had been placed in that establishment perfectly sane, but in a short time exhibited in it as raving lunatics. 
             
             
               CHAPTER X. 
               Mrs. Lovett's new Cook makes a Discovery. 
               THE reader would hardly suppose, from what we have recorded, that there was any danger that Mrs. Lovett's new cook would become tired of his situation; yet a week had hardly passed by, ere he was as anxious to give up the situation as he had been to obtain it. To a starving man, Lovett's bake shop, with a license to devour as many pies as he pleased, appeared pleasing and desirable. But a man will tire of good things. At first everything was delightful. By the aid of the machinery, the making of the pies was not difficult, and he had tasted them half-done, well-done and overdone, and they were delicious. It was twelve o'clock-the fifth day after his arrival-he had eaten nothing. Before him lay a pie untouched. 
               "The pies are all very well," said he, with his eyes fixed upon it. "They are made of the finest flour, the best of butter, and the meat, which comes from God knows where, is the most delicate-looking and tender I ever ate; but one cannot always live upon pies." 
               Feeling no desire to sleep, he, for the first time since his incarceration, concluded to take a survey of the apartment where he procured his meat. The vault was larger than any of the others, the roof was high, and come into it when he would, he always found plenty of meat, either in lumps or cut up into slices. 
               "If I could ever believe," he said, "that any one had the assistance of the devil himself, in conducting human affairs, I should say that Mrs. Lovett had made it worth the while of that elderly individual to assist her; for, unless the meat gets here by some supernatural agency, how can it get here at all?" 
               He was about leaving the place, when he fancied he saw some writing on the inner side of the door, and on close inspection, he discovered a number of lines written with a lead pencil, which read as follows: 
               "Whatever unhappy wretch reads these lines, may bid adieu to all hope; for he is a doomed man! He will never emerge from these vaults with life; for there is a secret connected with them so awful, that to write it, makes one's blood curdle, and the flesh creep on my bones. That secret is this, and you may be assured, whoever is reading these lines, that I write the truth, and that it is as impossible to make that awful truth worse by any exaggeration, as it would be by a candle at mid-day, to attempt to add any new lustre to the sunbeams, and--" 
               Here the writing broke off, and the reader, who had perused the lines with the most intense interest, felt bitterly disappointed. In vain he searched over the door for more writing; there was none to be found. The writer had evidently been interrupted, and possibly met the fate he had predicted. 
               "This is worse than no information. I had better have remained in ignorance than to have received so indistinct a warning; but they shall not find me an easy victim." 
               As he stepped out into the vault in which the ovens were, he trod upon a piece of paper, so white and clean, that he was satisfied it had been there but a short time. With some curiosity he picked it up; but his curiosity was soon turned to dismay, as he read the following lines: 
               "You are getting dissatisfied, and it becomes necessary to explain to you your real position, which is simply this: You are a prisoner, and were such from the first moment you set foot where you now are; and you will find, unless you are resolved upon sacrificing your life, that your best plan will be to quietly give in to the circumstances in which you find yourself placed. As long as you continue to make pies, you will be safe; but if you refuse, your throat will be cut the first time you are asleep." 
               "Gracious Heaven! is it possible, that in the heart of London I am a prisoner, without the means of resisting these most frightful threats? It is too terrific to be true!" 
               He sat down upon that low stool where his predecessor had sat before receiving his death-wound from the assassin who had dealt that crashing blow whose only mercy was that it had at once deprived the victim of existence. 
               "If I am to die," he cried, "let me die as a brave man ought, with some weapon in my hand; but I will not be murdered in the dark." 
               He sprang to his feet, and rushed to the door which opened from the top into the vaults; he made a violent and desperate effort to shake it. But such a contingency had been provided against; for the door was of amazing strength, and resisted all his efforts, and he staggered back, panting and despairing, to the seat he had left. Then he heard a voice-it was not Mrs. Lovett's-and looking up to the opening at the top of the window, he saw a large and hideous male 
                     physionomy
                     physiognomy
                  , and the voice that came from it, was croaking and harsh. 
               "Continue at your work, or death will be your portion as soon as sleep overcomes you." 
               "What have I done, that I should be made, such a victim of?" 
               "Make pies," said the voice; "eat them and be happy." 
               Bang went the little square orifice at the top of the door, and the voice was heard no more. He sat for some time longer, and not even the dread he had of sleep, could prevent a drowsiness creeping over his faculties. At length he sprang to his feet, and shaking himself, said mournfully: 
               "I must do their bidding, or die; hope may be a delusion here, but I cannot altogether abandon it. Let death come in any shape it may, it is welcome." 
             
             
               CHAPTER XI. 
               What Befals Tobias. 
               WE would not, if we could, attempt to give a description of the horrors of a private mad-house. Suffice it to say that poor Tobias suffered cruelties which few could endure, and the hope of bringing the barber to punishment, coupled with the fact that there was a fair girl for whose sake he wished to live, only made life desirable. 
               It was customary for a physician to visit the establishment, and Fogg had selected a superannuated old doctor, whose eyes and ears were remarkably deficient, to examine his patients. 
               One morning the keeper entered the cell of Tobias, laid hold of him by the collar, and said: 
               "Hark you, my lad: you are going before a physician, and the less you say, the better. You know we keep a cart-whip here. Come along." 
               Tobias said not a word; but he was determined, even if his life should be sacrificed, to speak to the physician. 
               "What? ah! a mere boy, Mr. Fogg," said the doctor, gazing upon Tobias. 
               "Yes sir," said Fogg, "and it always affects me to look upon him. He has a fancy that some one named Sweeney Todd, is a murderer, and that he can discover his bad practices." 
               "It is false, sir, it is false!" said Tobias, stepping up. "Oh, sir, if you are not one of the creatures of this horrible place, I beg you will hear me and let justice be done." 
               "Oh, yes-of course." 
               "Sir, I am not mad, but am placed here because I am dangerous to criminal persons." 
               "Oh, indeed! Ah-oh-yes." 
               "I am a poor lad, sir, but hate wickedness; and because I found out that Sweeney Todd was a murderer, I am placed here." 
               "You hear him, sir," said Fogg; "just as I said." 
               "Oh, yes, yes. Who is Sweeney Todd, Mr. Fogg?" 
               "Oh, sir, there is no such person in the world." 
               "Ah, I thought as much-a very sad case-be calm my little lad, and Mr. Fogg will do all he can for you." 
               Tobias tried in vain to convince the doctor. Fogg called the keeper, and said- 
                
               "Watson, take away poor Tobias Ragg, but take him very gently, and stay with him a little in his nice, comfortable little room, and try to soothe him." 
               "Well," said Mr. Watson, as he saluted poor Tobias with a kick, outside the door, "what a deal of good you have done." 
               The boy's patience was exhausted, and this last insult maddened him. He turned with the quickness of thought, and sprung at Watson's throat, So sudden was the attack, and so completely unprepared for it was that gentleman, that down he fell in the passage, with such a blow of his head against the stone floor that he was nearly insensible; and before anybody could get to his assistance, Tobias had so pomelled and clawed his face that there was scarcely a feature discernible. The noise brought Mr. Fogg and the doctor to the spot, and the former tore Tobias from his victim. 
               Tobias was thrown into his cell, with a promise of vengeance as soon as the doctor was gone. 
               "Now all is over," he said. "I shall he killed at once." 
               In his new excitement he rushed to the door of his cell and struck in with his fists, when it opened, and he fell into the stone corridor between the cells. 
               "Oh, if I could but get out of this dreadful place," he thought; "if I could but once again breathe the pure fresh air of heaven, and see the deep blue sky, I think I should ask for no other blessings. I must," he said; "I will be free." 
               A thorough determination to do anything, we are well convinced, always goes a long way towards its accomplishment; and certainly Tobias now would cheerfully have faced death in any shape, rather than he would again have been confined to the solitary horrors of the cell from which he had by such a chance got free. While he was thinking that he would pursue the passage in which he was until he saw where it led to, he heard the sound of footsteps, and he shrank back. For a few seconds they appeared as if they were approaching where he was; and he began to dread that the cell would be searched, and his absence discovered, in which case there would be no chance for him but death. Suddenly, however, the approaching footsteps paused, and then he heard a door banged shut. It was still, even now, some minutes before, Tobias could bring himself to traverse the passage again, and when he did, it was with a slow and stealthy step. He had not gone above thirty paces, when he paused at a door from whence the sound of voices came, and placed his ear against the panel, and listened attentively. He recognized the voices as those of Watson and Fogg. 
               "You understand me, Watson," said Fogg, "I think that little viper, Tobias Ragg, is too cunning and too dangerous to live long. He almost staggered the old superannuated doctor." 
               "Confound him," replied Watson, "he quite staggered me." 
               "Why, your face is badly scratched; but between you and I, that boy will die suddenly." 
               "I think so, too, and die he shall during the night." 
               Tobias waited to hear no more, but made his way down the passage, closing the door of his own cell tightly as he passed it. He rushed down a pair of stairs, pushed open a door, and found himself in a small, dimly-lighted room, in one corner of which, upon a heap of straw, lay a woman, apparently sleeping. The noise which Tobias made roused her up, and she said- 
               "Oh! no, no, not the lash! I am quiet! Have mercy upon me!" 
               "Have mercy upon me," said Tobias, "and hide me if you can." 
               "Hide you! God of heaven, who are you?" 
               "A poor victim who has escaped from one of the cells, and--" 
               "Hush!" and the woman made Tobias shrink into a corner of the cell, covering him up with the straw, and then lying down herself in such a position that he was completely screened. By the time this was completed, Watson came and looked into the cell, muttering- 
                
               "You have enough bread and water till to-morrow morning, so you need not expect to see me again till then." 
               "We are saved! we shall escape!" said the woman, after the keeper had gone. 
               She now informed Tobias that she had succeeded in removing one of the flag-stones from the bottom of the cell, and worked under the floor with her hands until she had made an excavation sufficiently large for one to pass through, from the cell to the woodhouse, and all that was now needed was a rope by means of which they might scale the garden fence. Tobias tore up the quilt, which he braided together, and when the clock on the village church struck ten, they had reached the woodhouse, and stood by the garden wall. The moon was shining brightly, and fastening the rope about his waist, Tobias ascended a tree, and reaching the top of the garden-wall, fastened one end of it to the iron spikes, and lowered the other end to his companion. 
               "Come slowly-for God's sake, do not hurry." 
               "No, no." 
               At this moment Tobias heard the rope giving way; there was a tearing sound-it broke, and she fell. Lights, too, flashed from the house, and it was evident an alarm had been given. What could he do? If two could not be saved, one might. He turned and flung his feet over the wall, hung by his hands as low as he could, and then he dropped the remainder of the distance. He was hurt, but in a moment he sprang to his feet, for he felt that safety could only lay in instant and rapid flight. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XII. 
               Mrs. Lovett's Cook makes a desperate attempt. 
               THERE are folks who can and who will bow like reeds to the decrees of evil fortune, and go on bearing the ruffles of the world without complaining; but Mrs. Lovett's new cook was not one of those. The more destiny seemed to say to him, "Be quiet!" the more he writhed and wriggled, and could not be quiet. The more fate whispered in his ears-"You can do nothing," the more intent he was upon doing something. 
               "But what shall I do?" 
               Such was the rather vague question he asked of himself. Alas! how often are these four simple words linked together, finding but a vain echo in the overcharged heart. 
               "Many of these pies," he said to himself, "are not eaten in the shop, ergo they are eaten out of the shop, and possibly, at the respective houses of the purchasers-what more feasible mode of disclosing my position, and 'the secrets of my prison-house' can there be than the enclosing a note in one of Mrs. Lovett's pies? 
               He recollected that he was supplied with a thin piece of paper for the purpose of laying over the pies if the oven should by chance be over heated, and so subject them to an over-browning process. 
               "Surely," he thought, "I shall be able to make a substitute for a pen, and as for ink, a little coal and water, or-ah, I have it, black from my lights, of course. Ha-ha! How difficulties vanish when a man has thoroughly made up his mind to overcome them. Ha-ha! I write a note-I post it in a pie-some lawyer sends his clerk for a pie, and he gets that pie. He opens it and sees the note-he reads it-he flies to a police-office, and gets a private interview with a magistrate-a couple of Bow-street runners walk down to Bell Yard, and seize Mrs. Lovett-I hear a row in the shop, and cry-"Here I am-I am here-make haste-here I am-here I am!" Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!" 
               "Are you mad?" 
               The cook started to his feet- 
               "Who spoke-who spoke?" 
               "I," said Mrs. Lovett, looking through the ingenious little wicket at the door. "What do you mean by that laughing? If you have gone mad, as one cook once did, death will be a relief to you. Only convince me of that fact, and in two hours you sleep the long sleep." 
               "I beg your pardon, ma'am, I am not at all mad." 
               "Then why did you laugh in such a way that it reached even my ears above?" 
               "Provided I do my duty, you don't mind my laughing a little?" 
               Mrs. Lovett disdained any further conversation with the cook, and closed the little wicket. 
               Having satisfied himself that he was unobserved, he at once set to work to manufacture his note, which he did as follows:- 
               
                  SIR-(OR MADAM)-I am a prisoner beneath the shop of Mrs. Lovett, the pie-female in Bell Yard. I am threatened with death if I convinced to escape from my now enforced employment. Moreover, I am convinced that there is some dreadful secret connected with the pies, which I can hardly trust my imagination to dwell upon, much less here set it down. Pray instantly, upon receipt of this, go to nearest police office and procure me immediate aid, or I shall soon be numbered with the dead. In the sacred names of justice and humanity, I charge you to do this."
                
               The cook did not, for fear of accidents, put his name to this epistle, It was sufficient, he thought, that he designated his condition, and pointed out where he was.-He folded the note into a close flat shape, and pressed it with his hands so that it would take up but a very small portion of room in a pies into the oven. 
               After casting one more look at the pie that contained his note, in went the batch to the hot air of the oven. 
               "'Tis done," he said, "'Tis done, and I am saved!" 
               He sat down and covered his face with his hands, while delicious dreamy thoughts of freedom came across his brain. Green fields, trees, meadows and uplands, and the sweet blue sky, all appeared before him in bright and beautiful array. 
               "Yes," he said, "I shall see them all once again. I shall look perchance upon the bounding deep blue sea. Once again I shall feel the sun of a happier clime than this."-He fell asleep, and dreamed of early, happy years. 
               "Cook!" said a voice. 
               He sprang up and saw Mrs. Lovett gazing in at him. 
               "Here is a letter for you," she said, as she threw it from the wicket, "perhaps it is an answer to the one you sent in the pie." 
               The unfortunate grasped his head and gave a yell of despair. 
               "Lost! lost! lost!" he cried, "all is lost. God, is this enchantment? or am I mad? Let death come in any shape he may, he will find me an unresisting victim. I have fought with fate, and am, like thousands who have preceded me in such a contest-beaten!" 
               He lifted up the letter from the floor, and found it was addressed "To Mrs. Lovett's Cook, Bell Yard, Temple Bar." Curiosity tempted him to open it, and he read as follows:- 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           "Sir-Having, in a most delicious pie, received the extraordinary communication which you inserted in it, I take the earliest opportunity of replying to you. The character of a highly respectable and pious woman is not, sir, to be whispered away in a pie a cook. Reflect young man, on the evil that you have tried to do, and for the future learn to be satisfied with the excellent situation you have. The pie was very good." 
                           
                              I am, you bad young man, 
                              A Parishioner of St. Dunstan's 
                              SWEENEY TODD."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               "Now was there ever such a piece of cool rascality as this?" cried the cook. "Sweeney Todd-Todd-Todd. Who the devil is he? This is some scheme of Mrs. Lovett's to drive me mad." 
               Tears! yes, bitter scalding tears came to his relief, and he wept abundantly, but those tears were blessed, for as they flowed, the worst bitterness of his heart flowed with them, and he suddenly looked up, saying- 
               "I am only twenty-four." 
               There was magic in the sound of those words. They seemed in themselves to contain a volume of philosophy. Only twenty-four. Should he, at that green and unripe age, get rid of hope. Should he, at twenty-four only, lie down and say-"Let me die!" just because thing had gone a little adverse, and he was the enforced cook of Mrs. Lovett? 
               "No-no,"he said. "No, I will endure much, and I will hope much. Hitherto, it is true, I have been unsuccessful in what I have attempted for my release, but the diabolical cunning, even of this woman, may fail her at some moment, and I may have my time of revenge. Hope shall be my guiding star. They shall not subdue the proud spirit they have succeeded in caging, quite so easily. I live and have youthful blood in my veins, I will not despair. No-Hence, fiend!-I am as yet only twenty-four!" 
             
             
               CHAPTER XIII. 
               Consultation with the Magistrate. 
               COLONEL JEFFERY now determined to lay the whole matter of the disappearance of Mr. Thornhill before a magistrate, and he accordingly determined to call on Sir Richard Blunt, a man thoroughly conversant with criminal masters, and of indomitable courage. 
               Sir Richard was within when they reached his house, and, with the acuteness of a man of business, he at once entered into the affair. As the colonel proceeded, it was very evident that the magistrate became deeply interested. Colonel Jeffery concluded by saying- 
               "You will thus, at all events, perceive that there is a great mystery somewhere." 
               "And guilt, I should say," replied the magistrate. 
               "You are of that opinion, Sir Richard?" 
               "I am most decidedly." 
               "Then what would you propose to do? Believe me, I do not ask out of any idle curiosity, but from a firm faith, that what you set about will be accomplished in a satisfactory manner." 
               "Why, in the first place, I shall certainly go and get shaved at Todd's shop." 
               "Oh, yes; but do not fancy that I am so headstrong or foolish as to run any unnecessary risks in the matter-I shall do no such thing: you may be assured that I will do all in my power to provide for my own safety. We have before heard something of Mr. Todd." 
               "Indeed!-and of a criminal character?" 
               "Yes; a lady once in the street took a fancy to a pair of shoe-buckles of imitation diamonds that Todd had on, when he was going to some city entertainment tainment; she screamed out, and declared that they had belonged to her husband, who had gone out one morning from his house in Fetter-lane, to get shaved. The case came before me, but the buckles were of too common a kind to enable the lady to persevere in her statement; and Todd, who preserved the most imperturbable coolness throughout the affair, was, of course, discharged." 
               "But the matter left a suspicion on your mind?" 
               "It did; and more than once I have resolved in my own mind what means could be adopted of coming at the truth: other affairs, however, of more immediate urgency have occupied me, but the circumstances you detail revive all my former feelings upon the subject; and I shall now feel that the matter has some before me in a shape to merit immediate attention." 
               He made the warmest acknowledgments to the magistrate for the courtesy of his reception, and then took his leave. As soon as the magistrate was alone, he rang a small hand-bell that was upon the table, and the summons was answered by a man, to whom he said- 
               "Is Crotchet here?" 
               "Yes, your worship." 
               "Then, tell him I want him at once, will you?" 
               The messenger retired, but he presently returned, bringing with him about as rough a specimen of humanity as the world could have produced. He was tall and stout, and his face looked as if, by repeated injuries, it had been knocked out of all shape, for the features were most strangely jumbled together indeed, and an obliquity of vision, which rendered it always a matter of doubt, who and what he was looking at, by no means added to his personal charms. 
               "Sit down, Crotchet," said the magistrate, "and listen to me without a word of interruption." 
               If Mr. Crotchet had no other good quality on earth, he still had that of listening attentively, and he never opened his mouth while the magistrate related to him what had just formed the subject matter of Mr. Jeffery's communication. When he had concluded his statement, Sir Richard said- 
               "Well, Crotchet, what do you think of all that? What does Sweeney Todd do with his customers?" 
               "He smugs 'em.'' 
               "What?" 
               'Uses 'em up; it's as clear to me as mud in a wine-glass, that it is. Lor' bless you! I've been thinking he did that 'ere sort of thing a deuce of a while, but I didn't like to interfere too soon, you see." 
               "What do you advise, Crotchet? I know I can trust to your sagacity in such a case." 
               "Why, your worship, I'll think it over a bit in the course of the day, and let your worship know what I think. It's an awkward job, for a variety of reasons, but howsomdever there's always a something to be done, and if we don't do it, I'll be hung if I know who can, that's all!" 
               "True, true, you are right there; and, perhaps before you see me again, you will walk down Fleet-street, and see if you can make any observations that will be of advantage in the matter. It is an affair which requires great caution indeed." 
               "Trust me, yer worship; I'll do it and no mistake. Lor' bless ye, it's easy for any body to go lounging about Fleet-street, without being taken much notice of; so I'll be there." 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XIV. 
               How Tobias got to London. 
               WE will now take a peep at Tobias. On-on-on, like the wind, went the poor boy from the vicinity of that frightful prison-house. Terror was behind him-terror with dishevelled locks was upon his right hand, and terror shrieking in his ear was upon his left. On-on, he flew like a whirlwind. The perspiration poured down his face-his knees shook under him-his heart beat as though in some wild pulsation it would burst. Some fast runners had pursued him a short distance, and then given up the chase in despair. A man held out his arms to stop him, but Tobias dashed past him like a flash of lightning, and was off again. 
               "Stop him!" cried twenty voices; "Stop thief!" shouted some one who could not conceive that anybody was to be stopped on any other account. 
               "No, no," gasped Tobias, as he flew onwards-"not mad, not mad!" 
               His feet failed him. He reeled a few more paces like a drunken man, and then fell heavily upon some stone steps, where he lay bathed in perspiration. Blood too gushed from his mouth. A gentleman's horse was standing at the door, and the man came out to mount him at that moment, and he saw the rapidly collecting crowd. He pushed his way through the mob, saying- 
               "What is it? what is it?" 
               "A mad boy, sir," said some. "Only look at him. Did you ever see the like. He looks as if he had run a hundred miles." 
               "Good God!" cried the gentleman. "It is he? It is he!" 
               "Who, sir? who, sir?" 
               "A poor lad that I know, I will take charge of him. My name is Jeffery, I am Colonel Jeffery. When I am mounted give me the boy." 
               "Yes, sir." 
               He sprang upon his horse; Tobias was handed to him like a bale of goods, and laying him comfortably as he could on the saddle before him, off set the colonel at a good round trot to his own house. 
               "This is a prize," thought the colonel, "worth the taking. It will go hard with me, but I will extract from this boy all that he knows of Sweeney Todd, and we shall see how far that knowledge will go toward the confirmation of my suspicious regarding him." 
               He carried Tobias himself to a comfortable bed-room, and immediately sent for a medical practitioner of good repute in the neighborhood, who happening fortunately to be at home, obeyed the summons immediately. 
               "I know nothing of what is the matter with this lad; I have been very anxious to see him on account of certain information he possesses, and only found him this morning upon a doorstep in the street, in the state you see him." 
               "Is he very ill?" 
               "I am afraid he is." 
               The medical man followed the colonel to the room in which poor Tobias lay, and after gazing upon him for a few moments, and opening with his fingers the closed eyelids of Tobias, he shook his head. 
               "I wish I knew," he said, "what has produced this state. Can you not inform me, sir?" 
               "Indeed I cannot, but I suspect that the boy's imagination has been cruelly acted upon by a man, whom you will excuse me from naming just at present, but whom I sincerely hope to bring to justice shortly." 
               "The boy's brain, no doubt, is in a bad condition. I do not take upon myself to say that, as an organ, it is diseased, but fractionally it is damaged. However, we must do the best we can to recover him from this condition of collapse in which he is." 
               "Can you form any opinion as to his probable recovery?" 
               "Indeed! cannot, but is young, and youth is a great thing. The best thing that can be done shall be done." 
               "I thank you. Spare nothing for the lad, and pay him every attention, as though he were a son or a brother of my own: I long to hear him speak, and to convince him that he is really among friends, who are not only willing to protect him, but have likewise the power to do so." 
               The medical man bowed, as he said- 
               "May I ask his name, sir?" 
               He had his tablets in his hand ready to book the name of Tobias, but the colonel was so very much afraid that Sweeney Todd might by some means learn that Tobias was in his house, and so take an alarm, that he would not trust even the medical man, who no doubt had no other motive in asking the name than merely to place it in his list of calls. 
               "Smith," said the colonel. 
               The medical man gave a short dry sort of cough, as he wrote "Master Smith" upon his tablets, and then promising to return in half-an-hour, he took his leave. At the expiration of half-an-hour Tobias was put under a course of treatment. His head was shaved and a blister clapped upon the back of his neck. The room was darkened and strict quiet was enjoined. 
               "As soon as he betrays any signs of consciousness, pray send for me, sir," said the surgeon. 
               A faint moan had come upon the colonel's ears, and after listening for a few moments another made itself heard, and he fancied, by the direction of the sound, that Tobias's lips must have uttered it. 
               "Tobias-Tobias, fear nothing now, you are with friends; and above all, you are perfectly free from the power of Sweeney Todd." 
               "I am not mad! I am not mad!" shouted Tobias, with a shrill vehemence, that made the colonel start. 
               "Nay, who says you are mad, Tobias?-We know you are not mad, my lad. Don't alarm yourself about that, we know you are not mad." 
               "Mercy! mercy! I will say nothing-How fiend-like he looks. Oh, Mr. Todd, spare me, and I will go far, away, and die somewhere else but do not kill me now, I am yet such-such a boy only, and my poor father is dead-dead-dead!" 
               "Ring the bell," said Jeffery, "and tell John to go for the surgeon. Come-come, Tobias, you still fancy you are under the power of Todd, but it is not so-you are quite safe here." 
               "Hush! hush! Mother-oh, where are you, mother-did you leave me here, mother? say you took, in a moment of thoughtlessness, the silver candlestick? Is Todd to be a devil, because you were thoughtless once? Hide me from him, hide me-hide! hide! I am not mad. Hark! I hear him-one-two-three-four-five-six steps-and all Todd's. Each one loaves blood in its track. Look at him now! his face changes-'tis a fox's-a-serpent's-hideous-God-God! I am mad-mad!" 
               An appalling shriek concluded this paroxysm, and for a few moments Tobias was still. The medical man at this time entered the room. 
               "Oh," he said, "we have roused him up again, have we." Medical men are rather fond of the plural identifying style of taking. 
               "Yes," said Colonel Jeffery, "but he had better have slept the sleep of death than have awakened to what he is, poor fellow." 
               "A little-eh?" 
               The doctor trapped his forehead. 
               "Not a little." 
               "Far away over the sea! oh, yes-in my ship, only do not kill me Mr Todd-let me go and I will say nothing, I will work and send my poor mother hard-earned gold, and your name shall never pass our lips. Oh, no-no-no, do not say that I am mad. Do you see these tears? I have not cried so since my poor father called me to him and held me in a last embrace of his wasted arms, saying, "Tobias, my darling, I am going-going far from you. God's blessing be upon you, poor child," I though my heart would break then. but it did not, I saw him put from the living into the grave, and I did not quite break my heart then, but it is broken now! Mad! mad! oh no, not mad-no-no-but the last. I tell you, sir that I am-am-am not mad. Why do you look at me, I am not mad-one-two-three-four-five-six. God-God! I am mad, Ha! ha! ha! There they come, all the serpents, shriek-Help! God! God! God!" 
               "This is horrible," said Colonel Jeffery. 
               "It is appalling from the lips of one so young," said the captain. 
               The medical man rubbed his hands together as he said- 
               "Why, a-hem! it certainly is strangely indicative of a considerable amount of mental derangement, but we shall be able, I dare say, to subdue that. I think if he could be persuaded to swallow a little draught I have here, it would be beneficial, and allay this irritation, which is party nervous." 
               They held Tobias up while the doctor poured the contents of a small vial into his mouth. Nature preferred performing the office of deglutition to choking, and it was taken. The effect of the opiate was rapid, and after some inarticulate moans and vain attempts to spring from the bed, a deep sleep came over poor Tobias. 
               "Now, gentlemen," said the surgeon, "I beg to inform you that this is a bad case." 
               "I feared as much." 
               "A very bad case. Some very serious shock indeed has been given to the lad's brain, and if he at all recovers from it, he will be a long time doing so. I do not think these violent paroxysms will 
                     continne
                     continue
                  , but they may leave a kind of fatuity behind them which may be exceedingly difficult to grapple with." 
               "In that case, he will not be able to give me the information I desire, and all I can do is to take care that he is kindly treated somewhere, poor lad. Poor fellow, his has been a hard lot. He evidently has a mind of uncommon sensibility, as is manifest from his ravings." 
               "Will he awake soon?" 
               "Not for six or eight hours, and when he does, it is very unlikely that those paroxysms will again ensue. He will be quite enough." 
               "Then it will be scarcely necessary, during that time, to watch him, poor fellow!" 
               "Not at all. Of course, when he awakens, it will be very desirable that some one should be here to speak to him; for, finding himself in a strange place, he would otherwise naturally be terrified." 
               All this was promised, and the medical man left the house, evidently with very slender hopes in his own mind of the recovery of Tobias. The colonel thought it was highly proper he should inform Sir Richard Blunt of what had taken place, and accordingly went to his house, and finding him at home, and at once communicated to him the escape of Tobias from the mad-house, and his precarious situation. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XV. 
               The Cock has a Visitor. 
               SIR RICHARD BLUNT has for some time regarded Sweeney Todd with a suspicious eye, and he was now determined to find out, if possible, what had become of Mr. Thornhill. There had been, for a number of months, complaints made that St. Dustan's church was filled with a disagreeable stench, and although he could give no reason for it, Sir Richard could not divest himself of the thought, which forced itself upon his mind on hearing of the statement of Colonel Jeffery, that there might he some mysterious connection between Todd's victims and this unusual smell, and having been informed that the vaults beneath the church had not been opened for the last forty years, he determined to visit them and satisfy himself. 
               Accordingly he waited upon the lieutenant-general, and requested of him full power to give the subject a thorough investigation. His request was granted, and having provided himself with skeleton keys and implements for forcing the door, accompanied by the Lord Mayor, the Under Secretary of State and another official, entered the church. 
               Sir Richard stopped at the door, took a small silver whistle, and produced upon it a peculiar thrilling note. In a moment a tall man, with a great coat on him, merged from behind a column. 
               "Here you is," said the man. 
               "Is all right, Crotchet?" said Sir Richard. 
               "Yes-every thing is quiet." 
               "Well, Crotchet, you deserve and you shall have an ample reward for the services you are doing in this affair. I and some gentlemen will go into the church, and I wish you to remain at the porch, and if you find occasion to give any warning, I think you whistle will be quite shrill enough to reach my ears." 
               "Not a doubt on it, Sir Richard." 
               "Now," said Sir Richard, "the sooner we proceed to business, the better; the night is stealing past, and we have much to do." 
               A ponderous stone was raised, and just as Sir Richard prepared to descend a low moan came upon their ears. 
               "I-I feel very unwell," said the Lord Mayor. 
               "Pho-pho!" sad Sir Richard, taking him by the arm, "Remember the eyes of those are upon you whose opinions are of importance." 
               The Lord Mayor sank upon the cushions of a pew, while Sir Richard went forward. He soon ascertained that the noise proceeded for a couple of pigeons, and the peculiar sound made by these birds, by the aid of the echo in the silent empty church, had seemed to be of a very different character from its ordinary one. 
               Having satisfied himself, the magistrate retraced his steps, and as he passed the pew where the Lord Mayor was, he said, in a well affected tone of alarm, "Gracious Heaven! what will become of us?" 
               With a groan the Lord Mayor flopped down to the floor, where he lay perfectly unconscious. 
               Taking up the lanterns, they now descended into the vaults. As they proceeded, the stench became more and more sickening. Sir Richard led them through a number of vaults, and as they stopped a moment to rest, an audible groan saluted their ears. 
               "Listen!" said the secretary. 
               After a few moments more, they heard another groan, and now a voice, in wo-begone accents, said: 
                
               "I cannot sleep. It is of no avail. Alas! who dare sleep here? God help me; for I am past all human aid. Oh, bitter-bitter fate. I would that I were dead!" 
               There was a heartlessness in the pronunciation of the last word, which convinced Sir Richard Blunt of their sincerity. 
               "I can bear it no longer. Death of my own seeking, and my own choice as to method, is far preferable to this state of existence. Farewell to you, fair and gentle girl, whom I loved, and whose falseness first gave me a pang such as the assassin's dagger could not have inflicted. Farewell, dear companions of my youth, whom I had hoped to see again!" 
               "Stop!" said Sir Richard Blunt. 
               "Good God! who is that?" said the voice from the region of the oven. 
               "Your good genius, if I save you from doing anything rash! What do you do here?" 
               "Make numberless pies." 
               Sir Richard was now sure he was in the neighborhood of Lovett's pie shop. 
               "Who are you?" he asked. 
               "I am the most unhappy wretch that ever breathed. I am cribbed and cabined and confined. I live upon raw flour and water, and curse the hour that I was born. But where are you?" 
               "Upon the staircase, near an iron door." 
               "Ah, you are at the aperture where that abominable Mrs. Lovett issues her commands and her threats. If you have any compassion in your nature, and the smallest desire to hear a story that will curdle your blood, you will find out the means of opening that door, when I will climb up to it and make an effort for freedom." 
               "Are you in present fear of death?" 
               "No-not while I continue to make pies." 
               "Very good!" 
               "Very good! By all that's abominable, I only wish you had but to make them here for one week, and at the same time know as much as I know. I rather suspect you would never say very good again." 
               "Pray how long have you been here?" 
               "I have lost count of the weary days and anxious nights. Oh, sir, do not sport with me; for I am very, very wretched." 
               "If I was sure you were a victim of the woman who lives above," said Sir Richard. 
               "Oh God! you suspect me of being an accomplice. Well, it is but natural, finding me here. I ought to expect as much. What can I do or say to convince you of the contrary?" 
               "Reveal all." 
               "Do you know then, that-that-" 
               The man's voice sunk to a husky whisper, and when he had spoken a few words, there was a death-like silence. Sir Richard at length said: 
               "And you affirm this?" 
               "I am willing to swear to it. Release me from here and take me to any court of justice you please, and I will affirm it. If you have any suspicion of my good faith, manacle me. Bind me up in iron till I tell all." 
               "I am convinced." 
               "Oh, joy! I shall look upon the blessed sun again. I shall see the green fields and drink in the odor of sweet flowers. I am not quite desolate." 
               Sir Richard Blunt could hear him sobbing like a child. After a few moments, he spoke again, and said: 
               "My friend, I think I could set you free to-night; but to do so, would materially interfere with that justice which is speedily to overtake Mrs. Lovett. You say that while you continue making pies your life is not in positive peril. I ask you, for the sake of justice, to put up with your present position a short time longer." 
               "Liberty is sweet." 
               "It is; but you would not like such a woman as Mrs. Lovett to take the alarm and escape the consequences of her crimes." 
               "Oh! no-I will remain. For how long will it be?" 
               "I cannot say; but the time may be counted by hours, and not one shall be lost. Be patient, and I will come to you again." 
               Sir Richard and his friends now turned to examine the vaults on the other side; but no sooner had they thrown open the one nearest the bake shop, than the whole party stood transfixed with horror. 
               "Behold!" said Sir Richard, "one of the vaults of old St. Dustan." 
               For a moment or more, no one uttered a word; so it behoves us to state what that vault contained, to strike such horror into the hearts of bold, educated men. Piled one upon another on the floor, and reaching half way up to the ceiling, lay a decomposing mass of human remains-gaunt skeletons, with here and there pieces of flesh adhering to the bones, A ftid steam rose up from the dead, and upon the floor was a pool of corruption. Eyes, teeth, hands half denuded of flesh, while glistening vermin clipped glibly in and out of the heaped-up horror. 
               "No more!" cried the secretary. "I sicken-I am faint!" 
               Sir Richard Blunt let go the door and it shut with a hollow sound. 
               "Thank God!" he said. 
               "For what?" gasped the secretary. 
               "That you and I need not look on that sight again. We are sufficient evidence upon our oaths, that it is here to see." 
               With hurried steps they now followed the magistrate, and it was with a feeling of exquisite relief they found themselves again in the church, where the Lord Mayor was just recovering from the fainting fit into which he had been thrown by the noise made by the pigeons, 
               "Crotchet," said the magistrate, "associate with you Allen, Griffin and Weeks, and see that from this hour, no one is shaved alone in the shop of Sweeney Todd." 
               "It's as good as done, sir," said Crochet, and Sir Richard hurried to his office. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XVI. 
               Returns to Tobias. 
               THE reader may well suppose that Sir Richard Blunt had a sufficient amount of business on his hands. Todd-Mrs. Lovett-Tobias, But he had the utmost confidence in his subordinates, and knew he could rely upon them in any emergency. 
               His next business was to ascertain whether the messenger that he had dispatched, had found Mrs. Ragg, and for this purpose, early in the morning, he made his way to the house of colonel Jeffery. Todd's mother had immediately obeyed the summons; but she was so ignorant of the disease, and so anxious to be of service, that she was continually reminding him of those things which the surgeon was desirous should be kept from his memory. 
               "It appears," said the surgeon, "that you cannot think of anything that is likely to aid us in this plan of awakening, by some strong impression, the dormant faculties of Tobias?" 
               "No, gentlemen, no," said Mrs. Ragg. "I wish I could; for there's somebody else wasting away for grief about him; for if Tobias ever loved any body in all the world, it was little Minna Gray." 
                
               "Who is this Minna Gray, who so enthralled his boyish fancy?" 
               "Why, she's widow Gray's only child; me and Tobias used to go and take tea with her, as we both bequeathed women in a world of trouble." 
               "Bereaved. you mean. This Minna Gray is just the thing. Go and fetch her, by all means; but remember, Mrs. Ragg, that the safety of Tobias, as well as yourself, depends on keeping his whereabouts a profound secret." 
               Colonel Jeffery, when he heard that the medical man was of opinion that the experiment of awakening the feelings of Tobias, by bringing Minna Gray, was worth trying, at once acquiesced, and urged upon Mrs. Ragg to go and see Minna Gray. She was instructed to say that she had found herself unequal to being a laundress in the Temple, and so had thought it was better to return to her own original occupation of cook in a gentleman's family, and that, as she had the liberty to do so, she wished Minna Gray to come and take tea with her. Thus forewarned of the part she had to play, Mrs. Ragg started upon her mission, and colonel Jeffery, and captain Rathbone, who was staying to dine with him, soon saw the young girl as she was coming up the garden path. She was one of those small, delicately beautifully shaped lips and pearly teeth were of themselves features that imparted much loveliness to her countenance. She had, too, about her face all the charm of childish beauty, which bespoke her so young as to have lost little of that springtide grace, which, alas! is so fleeting. Add to all this a manner so timid, so gentle and so retiring, that she seemed to be an inhabitant of some quieter world than this, and you have Minna Gray, who had crept into the boyish heart of poor Tobias, before your eyes. 
               "What a gentle, quiet-looking little creature," said the captain. 
               "She is indeed; and what a contrast!" 
               "Between her and Mrs. Ragg you mean? It does indeed look like an elephant escorting a fawn." 
               They all descended to the drawing-room, and Minna Gray was summoned. Colonel Jeffery took her kindly by the hand and led to a seat, and then he said to her: 
               "Now, Miss Gray, remember that all here are friends to you and to Tobias, and that we all feel deeply for him and for you; but that is no reason on earth why you should not love each other." 
               Minna looked up at him through her tears, as she said: 
               "Is he very-very ill?" 
               "He is indeed. We suspect-indeed, I may say we know, that his mind has received so severe a shock that, for a time, it is deranged; but we hope that, as that derangement, you understand, has not arisen from any disease, pleasant and agreeable impressions may restore him. What we want you to do, is to speak to him as you no doubt have been in the habit of doing in happier times." 
               "Yes, yes, sir. 
               "I think you know exactly what we mean!" 
               "I do, sir-indeed I do." 
               "Oh, bless you, sir, she understands," said Mr. Ragg. "A nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse, you know gentlemen. Handsome is as handsome does, as I used to say to the late Mr. Ragg, who is naturally dead and gone, and accordingly buried in St. Martin's--" 
               "You can tell us that another time, madam," said the surgeon. "At present, you see we are rather busy. Now, Miss Gray, if you will have the goodness to come with me, we will see what can be done for our young friend up stairs." 
               Poor Minna Gray! How her color went and came like the sunlight of an April day, as she accompanied the three gentlemen and Mrs. Ragg up stairs to Tobias's chamber. How she trembled when they reached the landing, and what a faintness came over her when the door was opened, and she saw that dimly lighted room. 
               "Courage," whispered colonel Jeffery to her, "This is a holy errand you are upon." 
               "Yes, yes." 
               "Cut your coat according to your cloth," said Mrs. Ragg, who, provided she thought of a proverb, was not very particular with regard to its applicability to the circumstances under which she uttered it. "Keep your feet to the length of your sheet." 
               "Pray, madam," said the surgeon, who had quite a horror of Mrs. Ragg, "Pray, madam, oblige me by being silent." 
               "A still tongue makes a wise head." 
               "Good God, colonel! will you speak to her!" 
               "Hush, Mrs. Ragg!" said colonel Jeffery. Hush! you will perhaps be the means of spoiling this important effort for the recovery of your son, if you are not perfectly quiet." 
               Thus admonished, Mrs. Ragg shrank into the back-ground a little, and the colonel went to the window and let in a little more light. The surgeon conducted Minna Gray to the bedside, and she looked upon the boy who had won her childish heart through a world of tears. 
               "It is-it is, Tobias!" 
               "Is he much altered!" 
               "Oh, yes; much-much. he used to look so happy. His face was like a piece of sunshine!" 
               She sank upon a chair that was by the bed side, and sobbed. 
               "This will never do," said the surgeon." 
               "Wait-oh, wait a little," she whispered. "Only wait a little-I shall be better soon." 
               The surgeon nodded, and then stepping back to the colonel and the captain, he said: 
               "This burst of grief must have its way, or it will mar all. We must have patience." 
               They all hid themselves behind the folds of the bed-furniture, and Mrs. Ragg sat down in an obscure corner of the room. Gradually the sobs of Minna Gray subsided until all was still. She then gently took one of the thin wasted hands of poor Tobias in her own, and looked at it-she placed her lips into his heart, she said: 
               "Tobias!-my Tobias!" 
               The boy started. 
               "Dear Tobias-it is I. Minna!" 
               He opened his eyes, which had been closed, and seemingly cemented by tears. 
               "Tobias! Tobias, dear!" 
               A smile-a heavenly smile. It was the first that had played upon his lips since he set foot in the shop of Sweeney Todd, now broke like a sunbeam over his face. 
               "I am mad-mad!" he said gently, "or that is the voice of my Minna." 
               "It is your Minna. It is, it is, Tobias. Look at me." 
               He rose up in the bed; he cast one glance at the well-known and dearly remembered face, and then, with a gasping sob of joy, he clasped her in his arms. 
               "It's done," said the surgeon. 
               "Thank God!" said the colonel. 
               "You really know me, Tobias?" 
               "Know you, dear! Oh, why should I not know you, Minna? God bless you!" 
                
               "May He bless you, Tobias." 
               They wept together; Minna forgot that there was any body in the world but herself and Tobias, and parting the long straggling masses of his hair from before his face, she kissed him. 
               "For my sake, Tobias, now you will take care of yourself, and recover quickly." 
               "Dear, dear Minna." 
               He seemed never tired of holding her hands and kissing them. Suddenly the surgeon stepped forward, with a small vial in his hand. 
               "Now, Tobias," he said, "you are much better; but you must take this." 
               The look of surprise and consternation with which Tobias regarded him, was beyond description. Then he glanced at the bedstead and the rich hangings, and he said: 
               "Oh, Minna, what is all this? Where am I? Is it a dream?" 
               "Give it to him," said the surgeon, handing the vial to Minna. She placed the neck of it to his lips. 
               "Drink, Tobias." 
               Had it been deadly poison she had offered him, Tobias would have taken it. The vial was drained. He looked in her face again with a smile. 
               "If this is indeed a dream, my Minna, may I never awaken. Dear-dear one. I-I--" 
               He fell back upon the pillow, The smile lingered upon his face; but the narcotic which the surgeon had administered to him, had produced its effect, and then enfeebled Tobias fell into a deep sleep. Minna Gray looked rather alarmed at this sudden falling off of Tobias from waking to sleeping; but the surgeon quieted her fears. 
               "All is right," he said, "He will awaken in some hours, wonderfully refreshed, and I have the pleasure of now predicting his perfect cure." 
               "You do not know," said colonel Jeffery, "what pleasure that assurance gives me." 
               "And me," said the captain. 
               Minna looked all that she thought; but she could not speak. 
               "Now, madam," said the surgeon to Minna, "our young friend must be left alone for some hours. It is now six o'clock, and I do not expect he will awaken until twelve. When he does so, I am very much mistaken if you do not all of you, find him perfectly restored and composed, although very weak." 
               "I will take care to be at hand," said the colonel. "Miss Gray, perhaps you will call and see how he is to-morrow, and all I can say is, that you will be quite welcome to my house whenever you think proper; but let me impress upon you one thing.' 
               "What is it, sir?" 
               "The absolute necessity of your keeping Tobias's place of abode and anything concerning him, a most profound secret." 
               "I will do so." 
               "If you do not, you will not only endanger the cause of justice, but in all probability his life; for he has an enemy with great resources, and of the most unscrupulous disposition in the use of them. I say this much to you, because the least indiscretion might be fatal." 
               "I will guard the secret, sir, as I would guard his life." 
               "That will do. Now come down stairs and let us have a glass of wine, to drink to the speedy restoration to perfect health of Tobias. Come, Rathbone, what do you think! Shall we be one too many yet for Todd!" 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XVII. 
               Johanna's Resolve. 
               JOHANNA OAKLEY'S thoughts were bent upon discovering the fate of Mark Ingestrie. She could not divest herself of the belief that it was he who, under the name of Thornhill, had disappeared at Sweeney Todd's shop, and the more she thought on the matter, the more anxious was she to have the mystery which hung around Thornhill, cleared up. She was seated, one morning, with her friend Arabella Wilmot, when a letter was brought to her. She opened it with trembling fingers, and read: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           "DEAR MISS OAKLEY-If you will oblige me with another meeting in the Temple Gardens, this evening, at or about six, I have something to tell you, although I am afraid, nothing cheering. Believe me to be your friend. 
                           
                              JOHN JEFFERY."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               Johanna resolved to meet the colonel, as he had requested, and as it was then past four o'clock, retired to her own room to get ready. 
               "What can he want me to meet him or," she soliloquised, "if he has no information to impart. Why could he not have written 'I have news of Mark Ingestrie.' I am determined to unravel this mystery." 
               "Now, Arabella," said Johanna, "will you come with me, to meet colonel Jeffery in the Temple Gardens?" 
               "Certainly I will." 
               Arm in arm the two girls walked down the street, till they came to Sweeney Todd's shop, when Arabella said: 
               "We will not pass that dreadful man's shop." 
               "Why not, Arabella? I feel the moment I leave the house, as though some irresistible fascination dragged me there, and I think I could no more pass down Fleet-street without directing my eyes towards that building, which perchance has proved fatal to my poor Mark, than I could fly." 
               As they passed, Johanna noticed a placard on the window, "Boy wanted." 
               They walked on, and met the colonel at the gate, to whom Johanna introduced her friend as "one from whom she had no secrets," and then, fixing her eyes in which the tears were glistening, upon him, said: 
               "You have come to tell me that I may abandon all hope?" 
               "No, no, Heaven forbid! but in brief, the lad who was in the barber's service at the time we think Mark Ingestrie called with the string of pearls in his possession, has told us all he knows on the subject." 
               "Yes, yes; and-and-- 
               "He knows very little." 
               "And that little?" 
               "Amounts to just this: That such a person did come to the shop, and he is certain that he never left it." 
               "It is as I expected," said Johanna, bursting into tears; "my own heart tells me that Mark Ingestrie was murdered there." 
               The colonel and Arabella endeavored to console Johanna, and after conversing for a while, they separated. 
               "Oh!" said Johanna, "would that I could solve the dreadful doubt. Others talk of Thornhill-I think only of Mark Ingestrie. This suspense will kill me." 
               "Do you think," said Arabella, "you would have courage enough to dress in my cousin's clothes, and go to Todd's shop?" 
               "Yes, I understand you, and apply for the vacant situation." 
                
               
                   
                
                
               "Yes, Johanna, it would afford you an opportunity of searching the place, and if any papers or documents which this Thornhill had about him, could be discovered, or if you could find nothing which indicated the presence of Mark Ingestrie there at any one time, you would come away with a heart more at ease." 
               "I should-I should. He could but kill me!" 
               "Oh, no, Johanna, your stay would not exceed a few hours." 
               "But what long hours they would be." 
               "Well, I almost dread the counsel I am giving you-it is fraught with a thousand dangers and mischiefs, and if any harm should come to you--" 
               "Then absolve yourself, Arabella, from all reproach. I go upon my own responsibility. All I ask of you is, to obtain for me your cousin's clothes, and persuade my father to allow me to spend a few days with you, and I shall then, perhaps, ask no more of your friendship in this world. 
                
               "Sweeney Todd sat in his shop. A cold perspiration had suddenly broken out upon his brow, and for the space of about ten minutes, he was subject to one of those strange foreshadowings of coming ills to him, which of late had begun to make his waking hours any thing but joyous, and his dreams hideous. 
               "Oh," he muttered, "it is the recollection of that dreadful woman! It is the dim and shadowy thought of what I must do with her that shatters me. There was a time when I used to say she and I could not live in the same country now I feel that we cannot live in the same world. If poison will not do the deed, steel or bullet must. Ah!" 
               Some one was trying the handle of the shop-door and so timidly was it tried, that Todd stood still to listen. 
               "Who is it?" he gasped. Still the handle of the door-lock only shook. 
               "Come in," he now cried. 
               The person without was evidently anxious to obey the invitation, and a more strenuous effort was made to unfasten the door. It yielded at length. A young and pretty lad, apparently of about thirteen or fourteen years of age, stood upon the threshold. He and Sweeney Todd looked at each other in silence for a few moments. If a painter or a sculptor could have caught them as they stood, and transferred them to canvass or marble, he might have called them an idea of Guilt and Innocence. There was Todd with evil passions and wickedness written upon every feature of his face. There was the boy, with the rosy gentleness and innocence of Heaven written upon his brow. God made both these creatures! It was Todd who broke the silence. A gathering flush was upon the face of the boy, and he could not speak. 
               "What do you want?" said Todd. 
               He rattled his chair as he spoke, as though he would have said, "it is not to be shaved." The boy was too much engaged with his own thoughts, to pay much attention to Todd's pantomime. Something he would fain have uttered, seemed to stick in his throat. 
               "What is it?" again demanded Todd, eagerly. 
               This roused the boy. The boy, do we say? Ah, our readers have already recognized in that boy the beautiful and enthusiastic Johanna Oakley. 
               "You want a boy, sir." 
               "Oh," said Todd, as the object of the visit at once thus became clear and apparent to him. "Oh, that's it." 
               "Yes, sir." 
               Todd held up his hand to his eyes, as though he were shading them from sunlight, as he gazed upon Johanna, and then, in an abrupt tone of voice, he said- 
               "You won't do." 
                
               "Thank you, sir." 
               She moved towards the door. Her hand touched the handle. It was not fast. The door opened. Another moment, and she would have been gone. 
               "Stop!" cried Todd. 
               She returned at once. 
               "You don't look like a lad in want of a situation. Your clothes are good, your whole appearance is that of a young gentleman. What do you mean by coming here to ask to be an errand boy in a barber's shop? I don't understand it. You had different expectations." 
               "Yes, sir. But Mrs. Green--" 
               "Mrs. who?" 
               "Green, sir, my mother-in-law, don't use me well, and I would rather go to sea, or seek my living in any way, than go back again to her; and if I were to come into your service, all I would ask would be, that you did not let her know where I was." 
               "Humph! Your mother-in-law, you say?" 
               "Yes, sir. I have been far happier since I ran away from her than I have been for a long time past." 
               "Ah, you ran away? Where lives she?" 
               "At Oxford. I came to London in the waggon, and at every step the lazy horses took, I felt a degree of pleasure that I was placing a greater distance between me an oppression." 
               "Your own name?" 
               "Charley Green. It was all very well, as long as my father lived; but when he was no more, my mother-in-law began her ill-usage of me. I bore it as long as I could and then I ran away. If you can take me, sir, I hope you will." 
               "Go along with you. You won't suit me at all. I wonder at your impudence in coming." 
               "No harm done, sir. I will try my fortune elsewhere." 
               Todd began sharpening a razor, as the boy went to the door again. 
               "Shall I take him?" he said to himself. "I do want some one for the short time I shall be here. Humph! an orphan-stranger in London. No one to care for him. The very thing for me. No prying friends; nowhere to run, the moment he is sent of an errand, with open mouth, proclaiming this and that has happened in the shop. I will have him." 
               He darted to the door. 
               "Hoi!-hoi!" 
               Johanna turned round, and came back in a minute. Todd had caught at the bait at last. She got close to the door. 
               "Upon consideration," said Todd, "I will speak to you again. But just run and see what the time is by St. Dunstan's Church." 
               "St.-St. who?" said Johanna, looking round her with a bewildered, confused sort of air. "St. who?" 
               "St. Dunstan's, in Fleet-street." 
               "Fleet-street! if you will direct me, sir, I dare say I shall find it-oh, yes. I am good at finding places." 
               "He is strange in London," muttered Todd. "I am satisfied of that. He is strange. Come in-come in, and shut the door after you." 
               With a heart beating with violence, that was positively fearful, Johanna followed Todd into the shop, carefully closing the door behind her, as she had been ordered to do. 
               "Now," said Todd, "nothing in the world but my consideration for your orphan and desolate condition, could possibly induce me to think of taking you in; but the fact is, being an orphan myself-(here Todd made a hideous grimace)-I say, being an orphan myself, with little to distress me amid the oceans and quicksands of this wicked world, some very strong sense of religion-(another hideous grimace)-I naturally feel for you." 
               "Thank you, sir." 
               "Are you decidedly pious?" 
               "I hope so, sir." 
               "Humph! Well, we will say more upon that all-important subject another time, and if I consent to be your master, a-a-a--" 
               "Charley Green. If I consent to take you for a week upon trial, you must wholly attribute it to my feelings." 
               "Have you any idea yourself as to terms? 
               "None in the least, sir." 
               "Very good. Then you will not be disappointed. I shall give you six-pence a week, and your board wages of threepence a day, besides perquisites. The threepence I advise you to spend in three penny pies, at Mrs. Lovett's. in Bell Yard. They are the most nutritious and appetizing things you can buy; and in the Temple you will find an excellent pump, so that the half-hour you will be allowed for dinner will be admirably consumed in your walk to the pie-shop, and from thence to the pump, and then home here again." 
               "Yes, sir." 
               "You will sleep under the counter, here, of a night, and the perquisites I mention will consist of the use of the pewter wash-hand basin, the soap, and the end of a towel." 
               "Yes, sir." 
               "You will hear and see much in this place. Perhaps now and then you will be surprised at something; but-but, master Charley, if you go and gossip about me or my affairs, or what you see, or what you hear, or what you think you would like to see or hear, I'll cut your throat!" 
               Charley started. 
               "Oh! sir," he said, "you may rely upon me. I will be quite discreet. I am a fortunate lad to get so soon into the employment of such an exemplary master." 
               Todd, for a space of two minutes made the most hideous and extraordinary grimaces. 
               "Fortunate lad," he said. "Exemplary master! How true. Ha!"-poor Johanna shuddered at the dreadful charnel-house sort of laugh. 
               "My God," she thought, "was that the last sound that rung in the ears of my poor Mark, ere he bid adieu to this world forever? Then she could not but utter a sort of groan. 
               "What's that?" said Todd. 
               "What, sir?" 
               "I-I thought some one groaned, or-or sighed. Was it you? No. Well, it was nothing. See if that water on the fire is hot. Do you hear me? Well-well don't be alarmed. Is it hot?" 
               "I think--" 
               "Think! Put your hand in it." 
               "Quick hot, sir." 
               "Well, then, master Charley-Ah! A customer! Come in, sir; come in, if you please sir. A remarkably fine day, sir. Cloudy, though. Pray be seated, sir. Ahem! Now, Charley, bustle-bustle. Shaved, sir, I presume? D-n the door!" 
               "Now, Charley, the soap dish. Look alive-look alive, my little man, will you?" 
               "Yes, sir." 
               "You must excuse him being rather slow, gentlemen, but he's not used to the business yet, poor boy-no father, no mother, no friend in all this world but me, sir." 
               "Really!" 
               "Yes, poor lad, but thank God I have a heart-Leave the whiskers as they are, sir?-Yes, and can feel for the distresses of a fellow creature. Many's the-Your brother-I beg pardon, cousin, will be shaved likewise, sir?-pound I have given away in the name of the Lord. Charley, will you look alive with that soap dish. A pretty boy, sir; is he not?" 
               "Very. His complexion is like-like a Pearl." 
               Johanna dropped the soap dish, and clasped her hands over her eyes. That word "pearl" had for the moment got the better of her. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XVIII. 
               Startling Events. 
               BUSINESS at Mrs. Lovett's was brisk. During the whole of that most eventful day upon which the fair Johanna Oakley had gone upon her desperate errand to Sweeney Todd-the shop had been besieged by customers. Truly it was a pity to give up such an excellent business. The till groaned with money, and Mrs. Lovett's pies never appeared so perfect as upon that day. Five minutes-only five minutes-and the whole batch was cleared off, not one was left! 
               "Another batch of one hundred, gentlemen, at two," said Mrs. Lovett, with a bland look. 
               "At two, mum?" cried a customer. "Why, what's to become of the half-past one batch?" 
               "We are rather short of-of meat," said Mrs. Lovett, with one of her strange metallic smiles. 
               "The devil you are! Ain't there butchers enough?" 
               "Oh, dear, yes; but we could not get such meat as we put in our pies, at the butcher's." 
               "You kill your own, mum, then, I suppose?" 
               "We do," replied Mrs. Lovett, with another smile, more metallic than the former. 
               Mrs. Lovett put a placard in the window, announcing-"A hot batch at two o'clock."-She the closed the shop door, retired to the parlor, and cast herself upon a sofa, and hiding the light from her yes with one of her arms, she gave herself up to thought. Yes, that bold, bad woman, was beginning to have her moments of thought, during which in appeared to be as though a thousand mocking fiends were thronging around her. No holy thought or impulses crossed her mind. Solitude, that best of company to the good and just, was to her peopled with countless horrors. She could beat the quietude of the attitude she had assumed but for a very short time, and then she sprang to her feet. "Yes," she said, "it must, and it shall come to an end. I-I must have this," she muttered. "Let Todd be dead or alive, I must have it. I am going mad-I feel certain, that I am going mad, and the only way to save myself, is to flee. I must collect as much money as I can and then flee far away. If I cannot quite obliterate the past from my memory, I can at least leave it as it is, and add nothing to it. Yes, that man may live. He seems to beat a charmed life. But I must flee." 
               Mrs. Lovett had always pictured to herself wealth and retirement, respect and power, as the ends for which she was striving with such unscrupulous means. But of late, with a shuddering horror, she had begun to dread that all she had hoped for was getting only more distant. She had contracted a strong notion of the bad faith of Todd, and if such were really the case, all was indeed lost; there were some little difficulties in the way of Mrs. Lovett. Todd and the fair lady of the pie-shop had between them in the hands of a stock-broker, who was by no means to part with it to either of them except upon an order signed by both. So far all looked fair enough; and as they were likewise bound together by such a bond of mutual guilt, it did not look likely that either would make an endeavor to get the better of the other, or would likewise bound together by such a bond of mutual guilt, it did not look likely that either would make an endeavor to get the better of the other, or would peril the safety of both their necks, by getting up a quarrel about the division equitably of the spoil; but Todd never from the first-whenever that was-meant that Mrs. Lovett should share with him, and since she had begun to feel uncomfortable regarding the faith of Todd, Mrs. Lovett had kept what cash she saved at home; therefore some weeks had elapsed since she had paid a monetary visit to the city. If she had gone as usual, she night have got some news, Why, she asked herself, should she hesitate, to put Todd's name to the document necessary to get her half of the money from the stock-broker's? What a natural consequence from this question it was to ask her self another, which was-If I am forging Todd's signature at all, might I not do it for the whole amount as for half, and take the only revenge upon him he would feel, or which I dare offer myself the gratification of exacting from him? When such a question as this is asked, it is practically answered in the affirmative. Mrs. Lovett felt quite decided upon it. She was a woman of courage, and having procured the services of a young girl in the vicinity to mind the place for an hour, took a coach and drove to the broker's. 
               Mr. Brown was exceedingly polite, but his language was so mysterious that Mrs. Lovett looked furious. 
               "Sir," she said, "I must insist upon knowing to what all your mysterious hints and remarks allude. Speak freely and plainly, sir." 
               "Well then, madam, when Mr. Todd was last here, he said you had at last consented to reward years of devotion to you by becoming his, and that the ceremony which was to make him a happy man by uniting him to so much excellence and beauty, was to come off almost immediately, and that was the reason you had both agreed to withdraw all the money I had in such snug and comfortable safe investments for you both. He! he! he!" 
               Mrs. Lovett leaped, rather than walked, out of the broker's parlor, and on reaching the street jumped into the coach, pulling the door to after her. 
               "Where to, mum? 
               "To Fleet-street." 
               Mrs. Lovett buried her face in her hands, and sobbed bitterly, and it was not until she reached the corner of the street, where she alighted, not wishing to be set down directly at Todd's shop, that she was able to control her feelings. Brushing the tears from her eyes, she walked slowly towards the shop, revolving in her mind the best course to be pursued. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XIX. 
               A Friend in Need. 
               IT was not until Arabella Wilmot had parted from Johanna, that the romance of the thing faded away before the truth that she had advised her friend into a situation of the greatest peril. Each moment added to the mental agony of the young girl; and at length her sufferings became too acute for further dallying with, and wringing her hands, she cried: 
               "What shall I do to save her? What shall I do to save her?" 
               Arabella felt that it would kill her to endure the suspense of one hour; but to whom could she apply for assistance. If she went to Mr. Oakley, what could she expect but reproaches, for leading one so dear to him into such a path of danger; and an appeal to her own friends, would only send them to him. By mere accident, the name of Sir Richard Blunt came to her mind. She had heard colonel Jeffery speak of him, and from common report, she knew he was the man who had the inclination as well as power, to aid her. 
               "Yes, yes-I will go to him. I will tell him all. He will save her!" 
               She had the prudence to interpose no delays, by speaking to any one of her intentions; but hastily getting into the street, she made her way to the office of the magistrate. 
               "Is Sir Richard Blunt within?" she asked, on reaching the door. 
               "Yes; but you can't see him. He's busy." 
               "I must." 
               "But you can't, my dear." 
               "I will." 
               The man whistled, "Will is a short word, my dear, for you to use. How do you mean to do it?" 
               Just then a door opened, and Arabella rushed directly into the arms of the magistrate, exclaiming, "Yes, I will see you, sir. I have a matter of life and death to speak to you of." 
               "Do not hurry yourself, miss," said Sir Richard. "Pray be composed. I am quite at your disposal." 
               "Sir--sir. You-and you only. Todd, Todd-oh God! he will kill her, and I am more her murderer than he. Johanna-my poor Johanna!" 
               Sir Richard changed color at the sound of those names, and then said calmly: 
               "I don't think, unless you can assume a greater command of your feelings, that you will ever be able to tell me what you came about." 
               Arabella felt a little piqued, and said rapidly, but distinctly: 
               "Sir, Miss Johanna Oakley has gone to Sweeney Todd's, to find out what has become of Mark Ingestrie, and I advised her to do so; but now the knowledge that I did so, has driven me nearly mad; it will drive me quite mad." 
               "Miss Oakley?" said Sir Richard, rising from his chair; "why, what folly. But she has gone home again?" 
               "No-she is disguised as a boy, and has taken the situation that Todd put a placard in his window about, and she will be found out and murdered." 
               "No doubt of it." 
               "Oh, God! Is there no lightning to strike me dead!" 
               "I hope not; I don't want a thunder-storm in my parlor." 
               "But, sir--" 
               "But, Miss Wilmot, is she there now?" 
               "Yes, she went about two hours ago. O, sir, you must, you shall do something, or I will run into the streets and call upon the first person I meet, that has the form of a man, to aid me; I will raise the town, sir, but I will save her." 
               "That course would be about as wise as the original advice you gave Miss Oakley. Now what does she expect to accomplish by this disguised entrance into Todd's shop?" 
               "To search the place upon the first opportunity, for some relic of Mark Ingestrie, and so put an end to the torturing suspense regarding his fare." 
               "Do you think that Sweeney Todd would leave such relics lying about his shop? This is indeed a hair-brained scheme. Is the secret of the expedition confined to you and Miss Oakley?" 
               "It is-it is. All has been arranged with a horrible ingenuity. She is like one led to the slaughter, and she will pass away from the world leaving the secret of her disappearance to you and me only. Tell me at once what can be done. What will you do? 
                
               "I don't know, Miss Wilmot." 
               With a deep sigh, Arabella fainted. 
               It was seldom that, even amid his adventurous life, the magistrate found anything which affected him so strongly as that which Arabella Wilmot had related. With all his powers of rapid thought, he could not think of any mode of escape from the peculiarly awkward position into which this frightfully imprudent step of Johanna had plunged him. Calling his house keeper, he gave directions to have Arabella cared for, and not be permitted to leave the house; then, putting on his hat, he walked with a hasty step towards Fleet-street, 
             
             
               CHAPTER XX. 
               Johanna's Adventures at Todd's. 
               WE left Johanna in rather an awkward situation. The two graziers were in Todd's shop, and she-at the pronunciation of the word "pearl," which had too forcibly at the moment, reminded her of the string of pearls which had no doubt been fatal to Mark Ingestrie-had dropped the soap-dish, and covered her face with her hands. 
               "What is this?" said Todd, advancing in a threatening attitude, with a razor in his hand. 
               "I have broken it," she said. "You see, sir, I was overcome by the thought that as this was my first day here, how stupid you would think me." 
               "Stupid, indeed." 
               "Poor little chap," said one of the graziers, "let him off this once, Mr. Barber; he seems a delicate little lad." 
               Todd smiled. "I am quite a fool to my feelings," he said. "I couldn't hurt a fly. I used at school to be called Affectionate Todd." 
               "You don't say so. Well, my boy, you see no harm will come to you, as your master forgives you, and we are in no sort of hurry." 
               "I'm glad to hear that," said Todd; "for, as you are strangers in London, you will want to see some of the curiosities. There's the church of St. Dunstan's. Charley, put on your cap and show the gentlemen to St. Dunstan's." 
               But the gentlemen were not to be separated, and the exercise of all Todd's persuasive powers, could not induce one to leave while the other remained. 
               "Curses on you both," he said, as he bowed them out of the shop. "May the bitterest curses of-but, no matter-I-" 
               "What, sir?" said Johanna-"what do you say, sir?" 
               "Hell's fury! what is that to you? Dare you, you devil's cub, to ask me what I said? By all that's furious, I'll tear out your teeth with red hot pincers, and scoop your eyes from their gory sockets with an old oyster knife. D-n you, I'll flay you!" 
               Johanna shrank back aghast. The pure spirit of the young girl started at the brutal abuse that was launched at it by Todd. 
               "Did I not tell you," he continued, "that I would have no prying-no peeping-no remarking about this or the other? I'll crush the life out of you." 
               Todd went into the parlor, leaving Johanna to her own reflections, which the reader can easily imagine were not of the most pleasant kind. In half an hour he returned. 
               "I am going out. If any one should come," he said, "you can say it's no use waiting; for I may be gone some hours; but for your own private information, let me tell you that I may look in at any moment when least expected; and now while I am gone, let there be no peeping or prying about." 
               Todd put on his gloves, and then left the shop. Johanna was alone! Yes, there she was, at last, alone in that dreadful place, which now, for days upon days, had been food for her young imagination. There she was between those walls which had perchance echoed to the last despairing death cry of him whom she had loved better than life itself. There she was in the very atmosphere of murders. Oh, it was horrible! 
               "God help me now. Away tears," she said, as she dashed the heavy moisture from her long eye-lashes. "I have been strong in purpose. I have already waded through a sea of horrors, and I must be firm now that the time has come which I looked forward to when I thus attired myself. I am in the hands of God, and I will not flinch." 
               She fastened the door, and yet, although alone in that place, how cautiously she trod. How gently she touched one thing and then another, and with what a shudder she laid her hand for a moment to steady herself, upon the arm of the shaving chair. What was there in that chair that caused Johanna to shudder as she gazed upon it? It was fast to the floor, and resisted all her efforts to move it. She tried the door of the cupboard, and found it locked. She tried too the parlor-door; but it was fast. She opened a door under the counter, and beheld quite a collection of sticks and umbrellas. From some clothing, which lay on the lowest shelf, she drew forth a jacket, such as a sailor of the better sort might wear. Her sight was dimmed by tears as she said: 
               "Oh God! was this his?" 
               She held the jacket up to the light, and found the breast portion of it stained with blood-the blood of the hapless wearer. But yet how was she to prove to herself it had been Mark Ingestrie's? 
               "'Tis all in vain!" she gasped. "I shall know nothing, and only feel more desolate." 
               Some one was trying the handle of the door. She hid the jacket, and with a face pale as monumental marble, she opened the door. A lad handed her a letter. Her eye fell upon the superscription, and she read as follows: 
               
                  "To Miss Oakley-who is requested to read the enclosed quickly and secretly, and then destroy it."
                
               To tear open the letter, was the work of a moment. 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           
                               
                                 "From Sir Richard Blunt to Miss Oakley. 
                              
                            
                           "MISS OAKLEY-The expedition upon which you are at present, says much more for your courage and chivalrous spirit, than it does for your discretion, or the discretion of her who permitted you so far to commit your life to such chances. Your friend, Miss Wilmot, awakened when, thank God, it was not too late, and communicated all to me. I blame you both very much; and now, my dear girl, do not be under any kind of apprehension-for you are well looked after, and Sweeney Todd shall not hurt a hair of your head. If you should find yourself in any danger, seize the first small article at hand, and throw it with all your strength through the shop-window. Assistance will immediately come to you. And now, as you are where you are, I pray you have confidence in me, and remain till some one shall come to you and say St. Dunstan,' whom you may know is a friend, and you will follow his directions. God bless you. 
                           
                              RICHARD BLUNT."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               "I am saved! I am saved!" cried Johanna-"I am not deserted. Strong, bold men will look after me. Oh! what kindness breathes in every sentence of this letter." 
               Tears came into the eyes of the young girl; but after a few moments, she was more composed, and had just crumpled up the letter and cast into the fire for fear of accident, when Todd entered. 
               "What's that?" he said, pointing to the burning letter. 
               "Paper, sir." 
               "What paper?" 
               "A bill that a boy left. Something about churchwardens, sir, and the parish of St. Brides, Fleet-street, and how things mean to--" 
               "Bah! any one else been in?" 
               "No, sir." 
               Todd stood in the middle of the shop and cast his eyes slowly around him, to see that all was as he had left. Johanna crept close to the counter, upon which lay a small stone used for sharpening razors. She thought that would do very well to throw through the window, if any act of Todd rendered it he opened it, he took the key of the parlor-door from his pocket; but before he opened it, he took hold of the handle, bent his ear down, and listened attentively. Johanna threw down a chair, which made considerable noise. 
               "Confound you," roared Todd, "you tried this door!" 
               "I, sir?" said Johanna, creeping closer to the stone. 
               "Yes, villain you. At least I think so; but mark me-if I ware quite sure you should suffer for it." 
               He closed the door again and when alone said: 
               "What does it mean? A boy brought him a letter. Could it be the bill he spoke of? And then the sudden upset of that chair, which prevented me from hearing if the piece of catgut I had fastened to the door, had been moved. I will kill him. That is safe." 
               Todd went to the cupboard and took out a large knife, such as is used by slaughtermen, in the shambles, and placed it under the table-cover in such a manner that he could draw it out in a moment. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXI. 
               Mrs. Lovett and Sweeney Todd. 
               WHEN we left Mrs. Lovett, she had nearly reached the shop of Sweeney Todd. Her anger, which was up to fever heat, she endeavored to control, knowing that it would require all the energy she possessed, to cope with Todd, especially as he had the money in his hands. Having nerved herself up, she entered the shop with a firm step. 
               "Ah, Mrs. Lovett!" said Todd, "how do you do? Some more of that fine grease for the hair, I suppose, madam?" Todd winked towards the lad, (our dear friend Johanna,) as though he would have said, "Don't appear to know me too well before the boy. Be careful if you please." 
               "I have something to say to you, Mr. Todd." 
               "Oh, certainly, madam. Pray walk in-this way, if you please, madam-to my humble bachelor-parlor, madam. It is not fit exactly to ask a lady into; but we poor miserable single men, you know, madam, can only do the best we can. This way." 
               "No." 
               "Eh? Not come in?" 
               "No; I have something to say to you, Mr. Todd; but I will say it here." 
               And Mrs. Lovett gave a sidelong glance at the seeming boy. 
               Todd saw the glance. "Charley," he said, "You can go and take a little turn-here is a penny to spend; get yourself something in the market. But be sure you are back within half an hour; for we shall some customers, no doubt." 
                
               "Yes, sir," 
               Then Todd, as he folded his arms, and looked Mrs. Lovett fully in the face, said; 
               "Well?" 
               "The time has come." 
               "What time?" 
               "For the end of our partnership-the dissolution of your agreement. I will go on no further. You can do as you please; but I am content." 
               "Humph!" said Todd. 
               "After much thought, I have come to this conclusion, Todd. Of course, let me be where I may, the secret of our road to fortune, remains hidden here-(she struck her breast as she spoke.) All I want, is my half of the proceeds, and then we part, I hope, for ever." 
               "Humph!" said Todd. 
               "And the sooner we can forget, if that be possible, the past, the better it will be for us both-only tell me where you purpose going, and I will take care to avoid you." 
               "Humph!" 
               Passion was boiling in the heart of Mrs. Livett; and that was just what Todd wanted; for well he knew that something had gone amiss, and that as long as Mrs. Lovett could keep herself calm and reasonable, he should stand a poor chance of finding out what it was, unless she chose, as part of her arrangement, to tell it; but if he could but rouse her passion, he should know all. Therefore, it was that he kept on replying to what she said, with that cold insulting sort of "humph." 
               Mrs. Lovett took from a side-table an iron, one of those used in the mystery of hair-dressing-was used for some purpose-and in a cool, calm voice, she said: 
               "If you do not answer me as you ought, I will throw this through your window, into the street, and the first person who comes in, in consequence, I will ask to seize Todd, the murderer! and offer myself as evidence of his numerous atrocities-contrite evidence-repenting of my share in them, and relying upon the mercy of the crown, which for my denouncing you, may graciously pardon me." 
               "And so it has come to this?" said Todd. 
               "You see and hear that it has." 
               "Are you mad?" he said. 
               "No." 
               "Then, what in the name of all that is devilish, has got possession of you?" 
               "I have told you my determination. give me twenty thousand pounds-You may profit by the odd sum-give me that amount, and I will go in peace, You know I am entitled to more; but there is no occasion for us to reckon closely. Give me the sum I seek, and you will see me no more." 
               "You take me by surprise. Just step into the parlor, and--" 
               "No, no." 
               "Why not? Do you suspect--" 
               "I suspect nothing; but I am sure of much. Now, for me to set foot within your parlor, would be tantamount to the commission of suicide, and I am not yet come to that. You understand me?" 
               Todd understood her. His hand strayed to a razor that lay partially open close to him. Mrs. Lovett raised the iron. 
               "Beware!" she said. 
               "This is child's play," he said. "You and I, Mrs. Lovett, ought to be above all this-far above it. You want your half of our joint business, and I must confess, at the moment, that the demand rather staggered and distressed me; but the more I think of it, the more reasonable it appears." 
                
               "Very well. Give it to me, then." 
               "Why, really now, my dear Mrs. Lovett, you quite forget that all our joint savings are in the hands of Mr. Brown." 
               Todd glared at her as if he would have read her very soul. She felt that he more than suspected she knew all, and she adopted the bold policy of avowing it. 
               "I do not forget any thing that it is essential should be remembered," she said; "and among other things, I know that by forging my name, you have withdrawn the whole of the money from the hands of Brown. It is not worth our while to dispute concerning your motives for such an act. Let it suffice that I know it, and that I am here to demand my due." 
               "Ha! ha!" 
               "You laugh?" 
               "I do indeed. Why, really now-ha! ha!-this is good; and so it is this withdrawal of the money from Brown, that made all this riot in your brain? Why, I withdrew it from him simply because I had secret information his affairs were not in the best order." 
               "Well, well-it matters not what were your reasons. Give me my half. It will then be out of your custody, and you will have no anxiety concerning it-will you?" 
               "If I had it here; but I have re-invested the whole, you see, and cannot get it at a moment's notice. I have moved it from the hands of Brown to those of Black." 
               "Do you think me so-" green, Mrs. Lovett was going to say; but the accidental conjunction of the colors-brown, black, and green-suddenly struck her as ludicrous, and she altered it to foolish. "Do you think me so foolish, as for one moment to credit you?" 
               "Hark you, Mrs. Lovett," pursued Todd, suddenly assuming quite a different tone. "You have come here full of passion, because you thought I was deceiving you. It is, I believe, one of the penalties of all associations for guilty purpose, that there should be mutual distrust. I tell you again, if I had not moved the money from Brown, we should have lost it all." 
               "And why not come to me, and get my signature?" 
               "There really was not time," said Todd. I was in the city, and heard the rumor of Brown's instability. I flew into a shop. I wrote the order like a flash of lightning. I went to Brown like an avalanche, and I brought away the money, as if heaven and earth were coming together." 
               There was not the ghost of a smile upon Todd's face, as he made use of these superlatives. Mrs. Lovett began to be staggered. 
               "Then you have it here?" 
               "No, no!" 
               "You have. Tell me that you have, and that this Mr. Black you mention, is a mere delusion." 
               "Black may be no color; but it is not a delusion." 
               "You trifle with me. Beware!" 
               "In a word then, my charming Mrs. Lovett, I dreaded to bring the money here. I thought my house the most unsafe place in the world for it. I and you stand on the brink of a precipice. A slumbering volcano is beneath out feet. Pshaw! Where is you old acuteness, that you do not see at once how truly foolish it would have been to bring the money here? This night, after business was over and the shop was closed, I intended to have come to you, and fully explained this that you have unfortunately tortured yourself by finding out. I regret that you think of so quickly leaving the profits of a partnership which, in a short time longer, would have made us rich as monarch. Of course, if you leave I am compelled." 
               "You are compelled" 
                
               "Yes. How can I carry on business without you? How could I, without your aid, dispose of the--" 
               "Hush, hush!" 
               Mrs. Lovett shuddered. 
               "As you please," said Todd. "I only regret that a copartnership that promised such happy results, should now be broken up. However, that is a matter for your personal consideration merely. If I had thought of leaving, and being content with what I had already got, of course it would have compelled you to do so. Therefore I cannot complain, although I may regret your excuse of right of action that equally belonged to me." 
               "Why did you say to Brown that our union was to take place?" 
               "Because it was necessary to say something, to account for the sudden withdrawal of the money; and surely I may be pardoned, charming Mrs. Lovett, for even in imagination dreaming so much beauty was mine." 
               "Todd," she said in a softened tone, "if I had forged your name and gone to the city and possessed myself of all the money, what would you have thought? Tell me that." 
               "Just what you thought-that it was a scandalous breach of faith; but an explanation ought to put that right." 
               "It has." 
               "Then you are satisfied?" 
               "I am. At what time shall we go together to-morrow morning, to Mr. Black's in Abchurch-lane?" 
               "Name your own time," said Todd, with the most assumed air in the world. "Black lives at Ballam Hill, and don't get to business until ten; but any time after that will do." 
               "I will come here at ten, then." 
               "Well, Mrs. Lovett, you and I had far better be friends than foes; and above all, you ought by this time to feel that you could trust me. The very fact that to all the world else I am false, ought to prove to you that to you I am true. No human being can exist purely isolated, and I am not an exception." 
               "Say no more-say no more. We will meet to-morrow, at ten." 
               "At ten be it, and then we will go to Black. Come now, since all this is settled, take a glass of wine to our--" 
               "No, no. Not that. I-I am not very well. A throbbing head-ache-a-. That is, no!" 
               "As you please-as you please. By-the-by, did Black give me a receipt, or did he say it was not usual? Stay a moment, I will look in my secretaire. Sit down a moment in the shaving chair; I will be with you again directly." 
               "We will settle that to-morrow," said Mrs. Lovett; "I feel convinced that Black did not give you a receipt. Good day." 
               She left the shop, unceremoniously carrying the iron with her. Todd breathed more freely when Mrs. Lovett was gone. He gave one of those horrible laughs as he watched her through the opening in his window. 
               "He! ha! Curses on her; but I will have her life first, ere she sees one guinea of my hoard!" 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXII. 
               Johanna in Danger. 
               "CHARLEY," cried Todd, "Charley." 
               "Yes, sir." 
               "Step in here, a moment, I want you, my boy." 
               "Shall I or shall I not?" thought Johanna. "Is this danger, or only the appearance of it? Heaven direct me now! Oh, what shall I do?" 
                
               Todd drew the knife from beneath the table cover, gave one of his horrible grins, and restored it to its hiding place. 
               "Charley? Are you coming, my boy?" 
               "Yes, sir, I--am coming. God protect me!" 
               "The barber at home?" cried a voice at the door; and in another moment a man with a ruddy, jolly-looking countenance, made his appearance in the shop. "Barber at home, eh? my little lad?" 
               "Yes-yes." 
               Johanna heard a bitter execration come from the lips of Todd, and then, with quite a serene smile on his face, he made his appearance. 
               "Could you make me a wig?" said the man, taking off his hat and showing that his hair was closely cropped. 
               "Certainly, sir, if you will allow me to measure your head. Charley, you can go to Lovett's and get a pie." 
               "Shaved," if you please, said another man, walking into the shop and pouncing down into a chair, as though it were his own property. "Ah, dear me, I'm rather tried, don't hurry yourself, Mr. Todd." 
               "Charley," said Todd, who was measuring the gentleman's head, "you need not go just yet, I want the hot water. Now, sir, leave it all to me, and I will match your hair to a shade." 
               "But that's just what I don't want. I am tired of the old color. I want it a few shades lighter than my own. But pray shave this gentleman, and I will tell you how I wish it to look at my leisure." 
               The man took a seat and crossed one leg over the other with a home sort of a look, while the man who had come to be shaved plumped into the shaving chair, and gave his chin a rub as though he would say, "I don't care how soon you begin." 
               Todd smiled. "Charley, the lather." 
               "Yes, sir. Here it is." 
               "Here, my little man," said the gentleman in want of a wig; "if you can tie a bow, just make one in front of my cravat-a small one." 
               The gentleman slipped a small piece of paper into Johanna's jacket pocket. 
               Johanna started. 
               "St. Dunstan's," said the stranger. 
               "What?" said Todd. 
               "St. Dunstan's last Sunday, I don't think was so highly scented with the flavor of the grave as usual." 
               Johanna trembled, for certainly Todd looked suspicious, and yet what could he have seen? She gathered courage. He glanced at her, saying- 
               "What is the matter, Charley? you don't look well at all, my lad." 
               "I am not very well, sir." 
               "How sorry I am; I think, that one of Mrs. Lovett's hot pies would be the thing for you. Don't hurry, for if anything is wrong with your stomach, that will only make it worse, you know. Are you going, Charley?" Johanna darted from the shop, and the moment she got clear of it, she by natural impulse drew the little slip of paper from her pocket, and read upon it-"Miss O. do not if you can help it leave any one alone in Todd's shop, as circumstances may prevent us from always following his customers in; but if you should be forced to leave while any one is there, knock at No. 133 Fleet-street, This is from your friend R. B." 
               "133?" said Johanna, as she glanced around her, "133? Ah, it is close at hand. Here-here." 
               "From Todd's," said a voice. 
               "Yes-yes. A man is there." 
               "Alone?" 
               "Yes, and--" 
               Before she could say another word the stranger had darted from her, and made his way into Todd's shop. Johanna paused, and shrinking into a doorway, stood trembling like an aspen leaf. 
               "Oh, Heaven!" she ejaculated, "into what a sea of troubles have I plunged. Murder and I will become familiar, and I shall learn to breathe an atmosphere of blood. Oh, horror! horror! horror!" 
               The crowd in that dense thoroughfare passed on, and no one took heed of the seeming boy, as he wept and sobbed in that doorway. Some had no time to waste upon the sorrows of other people. And so Johanna wept alone. Ding dong! ding dong! What is that? Oh, St. Dunstan's chimes. How long has she been from the shop? Shall she return to it, or fly at once and seek for refuge from all the sorrows and from all the horrors that surround her, in the arms of her father? 
               "Yes. It is my place-I am in search of Mark Ingestrie. If he be living, it is I who must clear that man who is suspected of his murder. If he be no more, it is I, who weak and fragile as I am, must drag his murderer to justice. 
               "What now?" cried Todd, fiercely, as Johanna bounded into the shop so hurriedly. 
               "Nothing, sir-only the dog." 
               "Bolt the door-bolt the door." 
               "Yes, sir." 
               Todd wiped his brow. 
               "That infernal dog," he muttered, "will be the death of me yet; and so, Charley, the malignant beast flew at you, did he? the savage will attack you will he?" 
               "Yes, sir, so it seems." 
               "We will kill it. I should like to cut its throat. It would be a pleasure, Charley. How strange that strong poisons have no effect upon that dog. Curses on it!" 
               "Charley, if that man come again after his wig, get him into a talk, will you, and learn all you can about him. I have to go a little way into the city just now, and shall speedily return. I hoped you liked the pie?" 
               "Pie, sir?" 
               "Yes, Lovett's pie." 
               "Oh, yes-delicious." 
               "Ha! ha! he! he! ho!" 
               Drawing on a pair of huge worsted gloves, Todd walked out of the shop without saying another word. The moment he was gone, Johanna passed both her hands upon her breast, as if to stay the wild beating of her heart, as she whispered to herself- 
               "Alone-alone once more." 
               It was well that she had only whispered that much, for in the next moment Todd gently put his head into the shop. She started. 
               "Oh, sir-oh, sir, you frightened me." 
               "Beware!" was all he said. "Beware!" 
               The frightful head, more terrifying to Johanna than would have been the fabled Medusa's, was withdrawn again, and this time Johanna resolved to be certain that he was gone before she gave the smallest outbreak to her feelings, or permitted herself to glance around her in any way that could be construed into prying curiosity. She made a feint of clearing up the place a little, and with a broom that had about six hairs only left in it she swept the hobs of the little miserable grate in which a fire was kept for the shaving water. This occupied some little time; but still not feeling sure that Todd was really gone, she then went to the door, and looked right and left. He was not to be seen. With trembling eagerness she now began to look about her. Feeling how surrounded she was by friends, probably Johanna was a little more reckless as regarded the means she adopted of carrying out her intention. The parlor door was quite fast; but surely in the shop she thought she might find some weapon, by the aid of which it could burst open; and even if Todd should suddenly return, it was but a rush, and she would reach the street; and if he intercepted her in that, as God knew he might, she could take the means of summoning assistance pointed out by Sir Richard Blunt, and cast something through the window into the street. Full of these thoughts and feelings, the, and only alive to the mad wish she had of discovering some traces of her lover, Johanna hunted the shop over for some weapon with which to attack the parlor door. She opened a cupboard: a hat fell from within at her feet! One glance at that hat was sufficient; it was of a peculiar color-she remembered it. It was the hat of the man whom she left being shaved when she was sent ostensibly to purchase a pie at Mrs. Lovett's, in Bell Yard. Johanna's hurry was over. A sickening feeling came over her as she asked herself what was the probable fate of the owner of that hat. 
               "Another victim!-another victim!" she gasped. 
               She tottered back overpowered by the thought that there had been a time when, opening that cupboard door, the carelessly cast-in hat of Mark Ingestrie would have fallen to he feet, even as did that of the stranger, who, no doubt, now was numbered with the dead. She sank almost in a state of fainting into the shaving-chair. 
               "Oh, yes, yes," she said, "this is horribly, frightfully conclusive. My poor Mark. You have gone before me to that home where alone we may hope to meet again. Alas! alas! that I should live to feel such a truth." 
               She burst into tears, and wept bitterly, that any one who had seen her would have truly thought her heart was breaking in that wild paroxysm of grief. What a mercy it was that Todd did not come in at such a moment as that, was it not? The sobs subsided into sighs. The tears no longer flowed in abundance; and after about five minutes Johanna arose, tottering and pale. She drenched her eyes and face with cold water, until the traces of the storm of emotion were no longer visible upon her face; and then she knelt by the shaving chair, and clasping her hands, she said- 
               "Great God, I ask for justice upon the murderer!" 
               She rose, and felt calmer than before; and then, sitting down by the little miserable fire, she buried her face in her hands, and tried to think-to think how she should bring to justice the man who had been the blight of her young existence-the canker in the rose bud of her youth. You would have been shocked if you could just for a moment have looked into Sweeney Todd's shop, and seen that girl in such an attitude, without a sigh and without a tear, while all her dearest hopes lay about her heart in the very chaos of a frightful wreck. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXIII. 
               Sweeney Todd learns a Secret-Mrs. Lovett's Cook. 
               JUST as Sweeney Todd left the door of his ship, he saw two women on the opposite side of the street, earnestly engaged in conversation, one of whom he was sure was Mrs. Ragg. They were evidently conversing about Todd, as their eyes were fixed upon his shop, and occasionally a finger was raised and pointed in that direction. 
               "Curses on them!" he uttered, "what can they mean by looking in such a manner at my shop? I thought the last time I saw that woman, Ragg, she was cognizant of something. If now she, in her babbling, would give me any news of Tobias,-Pho! he must be dead." 
               Todd's curiosity was excited, and knowing that only one woman in a thousand can keep a secret, he followed them into an ale-house and having screened himself where he could hear their conversation without being observed, soon became very much interested. 
               "As I was saying, I don't feel uneasy now about Tobias, poor boy; for if ever a poor lad, as was a orphan in a half-and-half kind of way, seeing that I am his natural mother, and living, and thanking God, for the same, and health leastways, as far as it goes at this present moment of speakin, I-I-Bless me, where was I?" 
               "At Tobias." 
               "Oh, yes, I was at Tobias. As I was saying, if ever a poor body was well provided for, Tobias is. The colonel--" 
               "The who?" 
               "The colonel,-the colonel as has took the care of him, and who, sooner or later, will have all the truth out of him about the Toddey Sween." 
               "Who? Who?" 
               "Bless my poor head, I mean Sweeney Todd. Dear me, what am I thinking of?" 
               "The barber?" 
               "Yes, that horrid barber in Fleet-street; and between you and me, there isn't in all the mortal world a more horrid wretch living than he is; he takes folks in and does for 'em." 
               "Kills 'um!" 
               "You'll excuse me, Mrs. Jones, but the truth is, I ought not to say more than I have said; and if the colonel only knew I'd said as much, I can tell you, I think he'd be like a roaring lion. But Tobias is quite a gentleman now, you see, and he sleeps in as fine a bed as a nobleman could have for love or money. The colonel is very good to him; and there never was such a kind good-good--." 
               "Bless me, and where does he live?" 
               "Who?" 
               "The colonel. The good, kind, colonel-colonel-a-a dear me, I forget what you said his name was." 
               "Jeffery, and may his end be peace. He will get the reward of all his good actions in another world than this; such men as he can afford to smile at their latter ends." 
               Todd had heard enough to satisfy himself that Tobias was free from the mad-house keepers, and was in a situation where he would disclose all he knew, and little as that might be, Todd felt that it was more than he wanted made known. He darted from the ale-house, and made his way to his shop again. He listened at the door, and heard some one weeping bitterly. He listened more attentively, and the sobs became loud and distinct. 
               "It must be Charley," thought Todd. 
               He placed his ear quite close to the pannel of the door, in the hope that the boy would speak. Todd was quite an adept at listening, but this time he was disappointed, for the sham Charley Green spoke not one word. Yet the deep sobs continued. Todd was not in the best temper. He could stand the delay no longer, and bouncing into the shop, he cried-- 
               "What the devil is the meaning of all this? What is the meaning of it, you young rascal? I suspect--" 
               "Yes, sir," said Johanna, looking Todd full in the face, "and so do I." 
               "You-you? suspect what?" 
               "That I shall have to have it out, for its aching distracts me. Did you ever have the tooth-ache, sir?" 
               "The tooth-ache?" 
               "Yes. sir. It's-it's worse than the heart-ache, and that I have had." 
               "Ah!-humph! Any one been?" 
               "One gentleman, sir, to be shaved; he says he will call again." 
               "Very good-very good." 
                
               Todd took from his pocket the key of the back parlor-that key without which in his own possession he never left the shop; and then after casting upon Johanna a somewhat sinister and threatening look, he muttered to himself- 
               "I suspect that boy. If he refuses to come into the parlor, I will cut his throat in the shop; but if he come in I shall be better satisfied. Charley? some here." 
               "Yes, sir," said Johanna, and she walked boldly into the parlor. 
               "Shut the door." 
               She closed it. 
               "Humph," said Todd, "it is no matter. I will call you again when I want you. I am going out. Remember, Charley, no prying into drawers or closets,-if you do I'll cut your throat." 
               Todd put on a large coat, and casting a scrutinizing glance at Johanna, left the shop. 
                
               The reader will pardon us for having neglected the pie cook so long as we have, but other interests have occupied our attention. Let the reader he assured that the poor cook was not forgotten. Sir Richard Blunt had made several visits to the wicket over the door, and had received from the cook a written statement of his experience while in that horrid place. He had also given him instruction how to act, in case any danger was to apprehended. 
               Notwithstanding this, the cook was in a good deal of doubt as to whether this unknown visitor was true friend or not, and in a good deal of fear lest he should be discovered by Mrs. Lovett; in either case it was certain death to him. Like a drowning man, he had "clung to a straw." 
               Mrs. Lovett had not been as communicative to her cook within a few days, as usual. When she determined to quit the business and settle with Todd, she had made Williams several promises if he would continue faithful a few days, the last, and to him the most important, was his freedom. 
               Previously, then, to leaving, she sought the narrow opening in the strong iron door, through which she was accustomed to speak to the discontented cook, and fastening a bottle of wine by the neck to a piece of cord, she let it down into the prison-house of the pie-manufactory, saying as she did so- 
               "I keep my word with you. Here is the wine. I trust that you will keep your word with me. A batch is wanted to-day at twelve, as you know." 
               "Very well," said the cook. "Very well. They shall be ready. But you promised me my freedom, Mrs. Lovett." 
               "I did, and freedom you shall have shortly. All you have to do now is to attend to business for a little while. When I ring at twelve, send up the batch." 
               "I will-I will. But yet--" 
               "What is it now?"" 
               "If you only could fancy, Mrs. Lovett, what it was to pass one's time in this place, you would have some feeling for me. Will you send or bring me some real butcher's meat?" 
               Bang went the wicket-door, and the cook found himself once again shut out from the world in those dismal vaults of Mrs. Lovett's house. 
               The cook paced the cellars in rather a discontented mood, with his hands behind his back, reflecting upon things past, present, and to come, and upon his own dismal situation in particular. 
               "I cannot stand this," he said, "I really cannot stand this. I have had promises from Mrs. Lovett of freedom, and I have similar promises have been fulfilled. I cannot stand this any longer, it is impossible. I am driven mad as it is already, I must do something. I can no longer exist in this way." 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXIV. 
               Tobias in Jeopardy. 
               "WELL, Tobias," said Colonel Jeffery, as he entered the pretty, cheerful room into which the boy had been removed, "how are you now?" 
               "Much better, sir. Oh, sir,-I-I-" 
               "What would you say?" 
               "I feel that when I see you, sir I ought to say much to convince you of how truly and deeply grateful I am to you, and yet I can scarcely ever say a word about it, I pray for your happiness, sir, indeed I do. Your name and my mother's, and-Minna Gray's, are always uttered to God by me." 
               "Now, Tobias," said Colonel Jeffery gravely, "I am quite satisfied that as regard's all that has passed you feel as you ought to feel, and for my own part, I beg you to feel and to know that your saying anything about it only distresses me." 
               "Distresses you, sir?" 
               "Yes, it does, indeed, I see your eyes are upon the door. You expect Minna to-day, I am, sure." 
               A ringing at a bell now came upon Tobias' ear, and his color went and came fitfully, 
               "I hear her foot upon the stairs," said Tobias. 
               "Do you? It is more than I do." 
               "Ah, sir, the senses are sharpened, I think, by illness." 
               "Not so much as by love. Tobias! do you hear her footstep now?" 
               "Yes, and it is like music." 
               He had his head on one side in an attitude of listening; then with joy sparkling from every feature of his face, he spoke again. 
               "She comes-she comes. Ah, she comes fast. My own-my beautiful. She comes, she comes." 
               "This is real love," said the colonel, and he stepped from the room. Nearly on the head of the stairs, he met Miss Minna Gray. 
               "Welcome," he said, as he held out his hand to her. "You will find your young friend up, and much better." 
               Minna could not look her thanks. 
               "Minna, Minna!" called Tobias. 
               "I am here, Tobias." 
               In another moment she was in the room. Truly it was a pleasant thing to see the face of Tobias, when in sunshine. As he called, Minna came close to him, and in her soft voice asked him if he was better. 
               "Don't mind me," said Mrs. Ragg. "I am going to darn a stocking or two-that's all. Just say what you both like. Young folks will be young folks. Bless me, I recollect just as if it were only yesterday, when I used to speak to poor departed Mr. Ragg, who is, premature, dead and gone, in a manner of speaking. Ah, dear me! How the world goes round and round-round and round, continually." 
               Tobias and Minna were so well accustomed to the garulity of Mrs. Ragg, and so well aware that she required no answer, that they let her talk on, and did not mind her, as she requested they would not; and so the evening grew apace, and the light gradually began to wane, as those two young loving hearts spoke can only belong to youth and love. 
                
                
               Todd is skulking around the angle of the garden-wall, from which he can get a view of the colonel's house, and yet not be seen himself. 
               The more he looked, the more the desire grew upon him, notwithstanding the immense risk he ran of personal detection, by so doing, to get into the house, and finish the career of poor Tobias; for since Todd had become thoroughly aware that Tobias had escaped from the death he had intended for him, at the mad-house, his rage against the boy knew no bounds. 
               When it was nearly dark, he slunk in, crouching down among trees and shrubs, and crawling along like a serpent, as he was. He soon came to a flight of stone steps that led to the kitchens. 
               He was just considering what he should do, when he heard the tramp of horses' feet in the road above. He ascended sufficient of the steps to enable himself to a peep of what was going on. He saw a groom well mounted, and leading another horse. Then no other than colonel Jeffery himself, although he did not of his own knowledge feel assured that it was him, come out at the front door of the house and mount. 
               "Now, William," said the colonel, "we must ride sharply." 
               "Yes, sir," said the groom. 
               "This is lucky," said Todd, "It is not likely there is any other man in the house; and if not, I have the game in my own hands." 
               He crept down the remainder of the stone steps, and placed his ear quite close t the kitchen window. 
               Mrs. Ragg was enjoying a little conversation to herself. 
               "Ah!" he said "it's always the way-girls will be girls; but what I blame her for is, that she don't ask the colonel's leave at once, and say, "Sir, your disorderly has won my infections, and may he come here and take a cup of tea?" 
               Todd now arrived at the door of the kitchen. It was very unlikely to be locked or otherwise fastened, as immediately before a young woman had left the house, and passed close to him. Yet he listened for a few moments more, as Mrs. Ragg kept making observations to herself. 
               "Lor' a mussy," ejaculated Mrs. Ragg, "how my mind do run upon that horrid old monster of a Todd to-day. Well, I do hope I shall never look upon his frightful face again, and how awful he did squint, too. Dear me, what did the colonel say he had with his vision-could it be-a something affixity? No, that isn't it." 
               "Obliquity!" said Todd, popping his head in at the kitchen door. "It was obliquity, and if you scream or make the least alarm, I'll skin you, and strew this kitchen with your mangled remains!" 
               Mrs. Ragg sank into a chair, with a melodramatic groan than would have made her fortune in domestic tragedy, if she could have done it naturally. Todd kept his eye upon her. His first care now was to get between Mrs. Ragg and the kitchen door, lest upon some sudden impulse, she should rise and flee. Then he folded his arms, and looked at her calmly and with a devilish smile, while he took from his pocket a razor. 
               "Mercy," gasped Mrs. Ragg. 
               "Where is Tobias?" 
               "Up stairs-back room-second floor, looking into the garden." 
               "Alone?" 
               "No, Minna Gray is with him." 
               "Listen to me. If you stir from here until I come to you again, I will not only murder you, but Tobias likewise, and every one whom I meet with in this house. You know me, and can come to some opinion as to whether or not I am a man likely to keep my word. Remain where you are; move not. Speak not, and all will be well." 
               Mrs. Ragg slowly slid off her chair, and fell to the floor of the kitchen, where she lay, in what seemed a swoon. 
                
               "That will do as well," said Todd as he glanced at her, "and yet as I return,-he made a movement with his hand across his throat, to indicate what he would do, and then feeling assured that he had little, or indeed no opposition to expect in the house, he left the kitchen and walked up stairs. 
               When he reached the top of the kitchen stairs, he paused to listen. All was still in the house. 
               "'Tis well," he said-"'tis well. This deed of blood shall long before it can be done, and long before it can be thought that it was I who struck the blow, I shall be gone." 
               Alas! After passing through so much; after being preserved in so almost miraculous a manner from the murderous intention of Todd, backed by the cupidity of Fogg, and his subordinate Watson, was poor Tobias yet to die a terrible death, as a victim to the cruel passions of his relentless persecutor? No-we will not yet believe that such is to be the fate of poor honest Tobias, although at the present time, his prospects look gloomy. Todd may, and no doubt has taken as worthy lives; but we will hope that the hand of providence will prevent him from taking this one. He reached the landing of the first floor, and be paused to listen again. He thought this time, that he heard the faint sound of voices above; but he was not quite sure. Otherwise, all was quiet. 
               "He is here," he said. "I know his voice. Tobias is here. Ah! he mentions the name of God. Ha! He is more fitting to go to that heaven he can talk of so glibly; but there is none. No, no! all that is fable." 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXV. 
               Todd's Wonderful Escape. 
               "AND so you love me, Minna?" said Tobias. 
               How his voice shook, like a reed swayed by the wind, and yet what a world of melody was in it! 
               "Can you ask me to say yes?" was the reply of the fair young creature by his side. "Can you ask me to say yes, Tobias?" 
               "It seems to me," said Tobias, "as though it would be such joy to hear you say so, Minna, and yet I will not ask you." 
               "How well you have got, Tobias. Your cheek has got its old color back again. The color it had long before you knew there was such a man as Sweeney Todd in the world. Your eyes are bright, too, and you voice has its old pleasant sound." 
               "Used it to be pleasant to you, Minna?" 
               She held up her hand, and shook her head laughingly. 
               "No questions, Tobias! No questions.-I will confess nothing." 
               "Stop!" said Tobias, as he put himself into an attitude of listening, "what was that-I thought I heard something? It was like a suppressed growl. wish the Colonel would come home. Did you not hear it, Minna?" 
               Minna had heard it, but she did not say she had. 
               "Where did it come from, Tobias?"? 
               From the stair head, Minna." 
               "Oh, it is some accidental noise; such as is common to all houses; and such as always defy conjecture and explanation; and, being nothing and meaning nothing, always, comes to nothing. Yet I will go and see. Perhaps a door has been left open, and is banging to and fro by the wind, and if so it will only vex you to hear it again, Tobias." 
               It was Todd, who, upon hearing the soft and tender speeches from the young lovers, had not been able to suppress a growl; and, now that he had heard Minna Gray talk of coming to see what it was, he felt the necessity of instantly concealing himself somewhere. 
               It was not likely she would come down the stairs; so Todd adopted an original mode of keeping himself out of sight. 
               He descended steps sufficient, that by laying full-length along them, his head did not reach the top, and in the darkness he then considered that he should be quite safe from the casual glance, that in all likelihood, merely to satisfy Tobias, Minna would give outside the room door. 
               Todd thought by her manner she had heard nothing. 
               "No, no, Minna," said Tobias; "there is no occasion. It is nothing, I dare say; and I don't like you to be out of my sight a moment." 
               "It is only a moment." 
               She rose, and proceeded to her door. 
               An unknown feeling of dread, she knew not why, was at the heart of Minna. Certainly the slight sound she had heard, and that, too, in the house of Colonel Jeffery, was not sufficient to warrant such a feeling, and yet there, at he heart, it sat brooding. 
               She stood for a moment at the door. 
               It was only for a moment. 
               "How foolish I am," she thought, and then she passed out on to the landing, where she stood for a moment glancing round her. 
               "Is it anything, Minna?" called out Tobias, "or shall I try and come? I feel quite strong enough to do so." 
               "Oh, no,-no! It is nothing." 
               Minna stepped lightly back and sat down. She clasped her hands very tight indeed together, and then placed both upon her breast. 
               
                  She had seen Todd!
                
               Yes, Minna Gray had seen the man that had been, and who was, for all she knew to the contrary, still to be, the bane of Tobias's existence. The clear eyes of youth had noticed the lumbering figure as it lay upon the stairs before them. 
               And she did not scream-she did not cry help-she did not faint, she only crept back as we have seen, and held her hands upon her heart, and looked at Tobias. 
               There was no mistaking Todd. Once seen he was known forever. Like some hideous picture, there dwelt the memory of Sweeney Todd upon the young imagination of the fair Minna Gray. 
               Once before, a long time ago, it seemed to her, she had seen him in the Temple skulking up an old staircase. From that moment the face was daguerreotyped upon her brain. 
               It was never to be forgotten, and with face comes the figure too. That she saw upon the stairs. 
               Alas! poor Minna! 
               "And so it was one of those odd accidents that will occur in defiance of all experience and calculation?" said Tobias. 
               "Just that," replied Minna! 
               "Ah, my dear Minna! We are so safe here! It always seems to me as though the very air of this house, belonging as it does to such a man, so full of goodness as the Colonel is, such that nothing very bad could live in it long." 
               "I-I hope so-I think so. What a calm and pleasant evening it is, Tobias; did you see the new book of the seasons-so full of pretty engravings, in the shape of birds and trees, and flowers that the Colonel has purchased." 
               "New book?" 
               "Yes; it lies in his small study, upon this floor. I will fetch it for you, if you wish it, Tobias?" 
                
               "Nay; I will go." 
               "You are still weak. Remain in peace upon the couch, dear Tobias and I will go for you." 
               Before she left the room, she kissed the forehead of the boy. A tear, too fell upon his hand. 
               "Who knows," she thought, "that I shall ever see him in life again?" 
               "Minna, you weep!" 
               "Weep? No, no,-I am so-so happy!" 
               She hastily left the room. Todd had heard what had passed, and had turned to hide himself again. The young girl knew that the passed the murderer within a hair's breadth. She knew that he had but to stretch out his right hand and say-"Minna Gray, you are my victim!" and his victim she would have become. Was not that dreadful? And she so young and so fair-so upon the threshold, as it were of the garden of her existence-so loving, and so well-beloved! She felt for a moment as she crossed the landing-just for a moment-as though she were going mad.; But the eye of the Omnipotent was upon that house. She staggered on. She made her way into a bedroom. It was the Colonel's Above the mantel-shelf, supported on a small bracket was a pair of pistols. They were of a large size, and she had heard from the current gossip of the house how they were loaded, and how the servants feared to touch them, and how even they shrank from making the bed, least the pistols, from some malice aforethought, or from something incidental to such watching, should go off at once of their own accord, and inevitably shoot whoever chanced to be in the room. Minna Gray laid her hand upon the dreaded weapons. 
               "For Tobias! for Tobias!" she gasped. 
               "Minna," said Tobias,-"my Minna!" 
               "I come!" 
               She passed into the room, and the moment she crossed the threshold, she turned her face to it and presented both the pistols before her. Then as she would inch by inch, into the centre of the room, all her power of further concealment of her feelings deserted her, and she could only say, in a strange choking tone- 
               "Todd!-Todd!-Todd!" 
               "No, no, no,! God, no!" cried Tobias. 
               "Todd!-Todd!-Todd!" 
               "No-no! Help! help!" 
               "D--n!" said Sweeney Todd as he dashed open the door of the chamber and stood upon the threshold with a glittering knife in his right hand. 
               "Hold!" shrieked Minna Gray. "Another step, murderer, and I send you to your God!" 
               Todd waited. He could almost see down the barrels of the large pistols, which a touch of the young girl's finger would explode in his face. With a sharp, convulsive cry, Tobias fell to the floor. The blood gushed from his mouth and he lay bereft of sensation. 
               "Away!" cried Minna. "Monster, away! Another moment, and as heaven hears me, I will fire; once-twice-" 
               Todd darted to the stair head, but he darted away again quicker than he had gone there; for, who, to his horror, should he meet, advancing with great speed up the steps, but Mrs. Ragg, who had managed to get out of the kitchen, and who bore, as a weapon of offence and defence, the large kitchen poker, which was of a glowing red heat. Todd caught a touch of it on his face. 
               "O, you villain of the world!" cried Mrs. Ragg. "I'll teach you to come here murdering people. My poor Tobias is no more, I know; but I'll take the law of you, I will. Murder! murder! Police! Colonel!" 
                
               With an alacrity that was far beyond, to all appearance, Mrs. Ragg's powers, that good lady pursued Todd with the red-hot poker. He dared not take refuge in Tobias's room, for there stood Minna with the pistols in her hand, so he darted up the first flight of stairs he saw, which led to the top of the house. Mrs. Ragg pursued him; but when she got to the head of the stairs, Minna pressed too hard upon the hair-trigger of one of the pistols, and off it went. Mrs. Ragg fully believed herself shot, and rolled down the stairs, poker included; while Todd, laboring under the impression that the shot was at him, became still more anxious to find some place of refuge. Upon the landing, which he was not a moment in reaching, he found a great show of doors; for, he was, in fact, upon the floor from which all the sleeping rooms of the servants opened. It was quite a chance that the first one he bounced into was one that had in the roof a little square trap-door, facetiously called a "fire escape." Todd dragged a bedstead beneath the trap; and then his great height enabled him to thrust it open, and project his head through it. A trap-door of somewhat larger size in the actual roof, opened to the air. Todd dragged himself through, and fairly upon the top of the colonel's house. A slippery elevation! But surely that was better than facing a red-hot poker, and a pair of hair-trigger duelling pistols; and so, for a time, the desire to escape kept down every other feeling. Even his revengeful thoughts gave way to the great principle of self-preservation; and Todd was only intent upon safely getting away. He glared round him upon the night sky, and a goodly assemblage of chimney tops. What was he to do? In a minute he uttered a string of such curses, as we cannot very well here set down, and he turned preternaturally calm and still. 
               "Shall I go back," he said, "or escape?" 
               He heard the tramp of horse's feet, and peeping carefully over the front of the house, he saw Colonel Jeffery arrive on horseback, and dismount. His groom led the horse away, and the colonel ascended the steps. Then, and not until then, Todd made up his mind. 
               "Escape," he said, "and be off." 
               There was a long sloping part of the roof close to where he was, and he thought that if he slid down that very carefully he should be able to get on to the roof of the next house, and so perchance through their trap-door, and by dint of violence or cunning, or both united, reach the street. 
               It was a desperate resource, but his only one. 
               The top part of the long sloping roof was greater than he had imagined, and by the time he got about halfway down he found a dangerous and most uncomfortable acceleration of motion ensuing. 
               It was in vain he tried to stop himself; down he went with a speed into the gutter behind the copping-stone, that left him lying there for a few moments half stunned, and scarcely conscious if he were safe or not. Sore and shaken, Todd now looked about him. He was close to the roof of the next-door house. To be sure there was chasm of sixty feet; but its width was not as many inches, so Todd ought, with his long legs, to easily step it, and he stood fairly upon the roof of the adjoining house. Reasoning from his experience of the colonel's house, Todd thought he should very well be able to pitch upon the trap, in the roof of the domicil upon which he was, nor was he wrong. He found it in precisely the same relative position; and then he paused. 
               He felt the trap-door; it was fast. The knife, with which he would have been well pleased to give poor Tobias his quietus, was thick and strong. He slid it under the wooden trap, and by mere force lifted it up. The nails of the bolt easily withdrew themselves from the rotten wood. And flight by flight of stairs Todd descended in safety, until he reached the passage, and escaped. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXVI. 
               Morning in Fleet-street again. 
               ANOTHER day has dawned upon the great city-another sun had risen, and Todd had made all his preparations. Nothing was wanting but the match that was to set Fleet-street, he fondly hoped, in a blaze. His own house, he felt quite certain, could not escape. It would be a charred mass long before any effectual means could be procured to check the devastation of the flames, and then as the good ship spread its swelling sails to the wind to bear him to another shore, he should be lighted upon his way by the glare of the great fire in Fleet-street, that no one would be able to guess the origin of. 
               So he told himself. 
               Short-sighted mortals that we are! How little Todd, with all his cleverness-all his far-seeing thrift and fancy-dreamed of the volcano upon which he stood. How little he for one moment imagined it was possible that the sword of justice hung over him by so slender a thread. How he would have glared at any one who might have told him that he only moved about by sufferance; and yet such was the fact. 
               Sir Richard Blunt could put his hand on him at any moment, and say, "Todd you are my prisoner. To Newgate-to Newgate, from whence only you will emerge to your trial, and to the scaffold!" 
               No, Todd, good easy soul, had not the slightest idea of his real position upon that morning. 
               The morning felt rather raw, and Johanna was glad to warm her hands at the fire in the shop, which soon burnt brightly; but she did not venture upon keeping up a bright blaze for long. Todd's mode of managing the fire was always to keep a dry turf smouldering upon the top of it, from which ample heat enough was emitted to keep the shaving-pot upon the simmer. She now placed upon the fire one of those turfs, a small pile of which were always ready in the corner of the shop. She had scarcely done so, when the shop door opened, and a man walked in. 
               "Is Mr. Todd in, my little man?" he said. 
               "Yes, sir; do you wish to see him?" Johanna wished if it were possible, to discourage visitors, but the man sat down at once in the shaving chair and placed his hat upon the floor, adding as he did so- 
               "Yes, a right down good shave I want. As good as if St. Dunstan himself wanted one." 
               The manner in which the man pronounced the words St. Dunstan was so marked that Johanna felt convinced at once he was a friend, and she felt quite a gush of pleasure at the thought that Sir Richard Blunt had such a continual supervising eye upon her safety. 
               She felt she must not look at this man other than as a stranger. She felt that the least word of recognition might be fatal both to him and to her. She knew that Todd had some small orifice through which from his parlor he peeped into the shop, and that his eye was now upon her she did not doubt. 
               "I will call Mr. Todd, sir," she said in a moment. "He is close at hand." 
               "Thank you," repled the man. "I sit here as comfortable as St. Dunstan." 
               "Yes," said Johanna as she heard the watch-word of safety and friendship once more uttered by that man who was in truth one of Sir Richard's most confidential and trust-worthy officers. 
               She at once now proceeded to the door of the parlor and tapped at it until Todd opened it, and popped his head out with a grim smile. 
               "O, Charley, my dear," he said, "does a gentleman want me?" 
                
               "Yes, sir." 
               "A-hem! Good morning, sir," added Todd, as advanced, tying on his apron. "A shave, I presume, sir? A close shave, sir? I do think of all the luxuries in life, sir, a good close shave-what I call a regular polish off, sir-is one of the greatest in a small way. Charley, ain't it near breakfast time, my good lad?" 
               "Yes, sir," said Johanna, "I dare say it is." 
               "Very good. The hot water. Thank you, my dear-you will take two pence from the till, Charley and get yourself somewhere about the market a-well now?" 
               A thin man in a cloak made his appearance at the door of the shop, and taking off his hat, made a bow as he said- 
               "I believe I have the pleasure of speaking to the pious Mr. Todd?" 
               "My name is Todd; what is it?" 
               "I am truly delighted," said the tall thin man sitting down upon the nearest seat, and placing his hat upon his knees. "I am truly delighted to see you. Pray go on shaving that gentleman, as I shall be some time." 
               "Some time about what?" almost screamed Todd. 
               "Finding the tract, from which I purpose reading to you a few extracts upon the all-important subject of the election of grace, and the insufficiency of works." 
               Todd stropped a razor, and glared at the intruder, who, fitting on his nose with great precision a pair of blue spectacles, began rummaging in his hat. 
               "Humph! this is it. No-no. This is not it. Well, I thought I had it here and so I have. This is-no. This is an imaginary and highly religious discourse upon saints, and St. Dunstan in particular." 
               Johanna knew in a moment that this other man was a friend likewise. He, too, had had pronounced the words of St. Dunstan in a peculiar manner. 
               Todd suddenly became quite calm. "You can go and get your breakfast, Charley," said he. 
               "Thank you, sir." 
               Johanna would not betray any haste but she shook with agitation as she neared the door; and then she recollected that she had not taken the two not doing so might create suspicion. She crept back and possessed herself of the pence. Todd watched her with the eyes of a demon. 
               "Are you going, my dear Charley?" he said. 
               She left the shop and did not look behind her, until she was quite in the old Fleet-market; and then just as she looked round, Sir Richard Blunt touched her arm, He explained to her some little matters of which she was in ignorance, or at least concerning which she could only conjecture. 
               "Both the persons whom you left in Todd's shop," he said, "belong to my force; and the one only went for the protection of the other, as I, of course, surmised that you would be r once sent out of the way upon some real or mock errand, to give Todd opportunity of committing a murder. My great object is to find out precisely how he does the deed; and the man who came in to be shaved was to make what observations of the place he could during the ceremony, while the other distracted Todd's attention." 
               "I understand," said Johanna. "I of course knew that they were friends when they mentioned the watchword of St. Dunstan to me." 
               "Exactly. I gave them instructions to seize the very first opportunity of letting you hear the watchword. Are there any large cupboards in the shop?" 
               "Yes. There is one of great size." 
               "Would it, do you think, hold two men?" 
               "Oh, yes. Perchance you, who are tall, might have to stoop a little; but with that exception as to height, there is most ample space." 
                
               "That will do, then. I cannot tell you, of course, the exact hour; but be it when it may, the moment Todd leaves the shop to-day to go upon any business out of doors, two persons from me will come and hide themselves in that cupboard." 
               "They will use the watch-word?" 
               "Yes, certainly; and you will so dispose any movable article in the shop, as to take away any idea that the cupboard had been visited, or in the slightest degree interfered with." 
               "That I can easily do." 
               "Well, here we are, then in Fleet-street again; and mind all this that I have planned has nothing to do with your proceedings to call for assistance, if any special unforeseen danger should occur to you." 
               Johanna, upon this showed him a gagged stone she had in her pocket, to cast through the window. 
               "Yes, that would do," said Sir Richard; "but I would gladly supply you with arms. Do you often looked at some fire-arms that my father had in his shop to sell once and I have seen them used." 
               "I am glad of that," continued Sir Richard. "Here are two very small pistols loaded. They army be thoroughly depended upon in a room; but they would not carry any distance, in consequence of the shortness of the barrel. If however, you should be in any sudden and extreme danger from Todd, anywhere else than in the shop, or there if you are pushed for time, one of these fired in his face will be tolerably effective. You can keep them both in your pocket." 
               Johanna shook her kind friend warmly by the hand, and then hastened to the barber's shop. As she got near to it, she saw the tall thin man who had so perplexed Todd about the religious tract, come out, and Todd followed that Johanna could not but pause a moment to look at him. 
               He suddenly turned his eyes towards her, and saw her. He beckoned with his finger, and she entered the shop. 
               "Well, Charley," he said, with quite an affection of good humor. "You are a good lad." 
               "I am glad you think so, sir," she replied, seeing that Todd paused for an answer. 
               "I cannot but think so. I shall have t look over some accounts in the parlor this morning and if anybody-any female, I mean-comes for me, say I am gone to the city, and that, after that, I said I would call in Bell Yard before I came home. You will remember that, Bell Yard. Be vigilant and discreet and you shall have the reward that I have all along intended for you, and which you should not miss upon any account." 
               If Todd now for one moment could have imagined that his plunder, which he believed was so safe on board a Hamburgh ship, was actually, on the contrary at the office of Sir Richard Blunt, in Craven-street, what would have been his sensations? Would he have laughed and sniggered over the bumper of brandy he was holding to his lips in his parlor? No, indeed. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXVII. 
               Mrs. Lovett comes for her Money. 
               IT was the special duty of one officer to report to Sir Richard Blunt a description of whoever went into Todd's house, and now this man made his appearance. 
                
               "Well," said the magistrate, "so Todd has a customer, has he?" 
               "I don't know, sir. It is a woman, well dressed, and rather tall than other wise." 
               "Mrs. Lovett, without a doubt. No one need go and look after that lady, for I don't know any one, except you or I, who is so capable of taking care of number one. Todd will find her a troublesome customer, and if she is at all the woman I take her to be she will not go into his back parlor quite so easily as he would fain persuade her." 
               "Then no one need follow, sir?" 
               "No; but if the young lad comes out, you may just look in and ask some frivolous question to sec what is going on. If the female is not in the shop-she is dead." 
               "Dead, sir!" 
               "Yes. She will not live a minute after she leaves the shop; but you may depend she will not do so; she is full as well acquainted with Todd as we are, so there is no sort of apprehension of her coming to any harm. I should indeed be sorry to lose her." 
               Sir Richard Blunt was right in his guess. It was no other than Mrs. Lovett, who, agreeably to her appointment with Todd, called upon him for her half of the plunder for the last few years. 
               "Is Mr. Todd in?" she said. 
               "No," said Johanna. "No, Madam." 
               Johanna did not think it worth while, at that time, to expose herself to the great danger of disobeying Todd's positive commands, to say he was not at home, merely upon a point of punctilious truth. Mrs. Lovett looked keenly at her. 
               "So," she said, "he is out-is he? 
               "Yes, madam." 
               "How long has he been gone?" 
               "Only a short time." 
               "Well, my principal business this day, is to see Mr. Todd. I have made such arrangements at home, that I can wait here the whole day if necessary for see him I must-and see him I will; I had a sort of presentiment that he might be out, not with standing? I have an appointment with him." 
               With this Mrs. Lovett sat down and composed herself evidently for a long wait-she did not sit in the shaving chair though. Johanna thought as she passed it, she rather shuddered; but that might have been mere fancy upon the part of our young friend, as Mrs. Lovett was not exactly of the shuddering order of human beings. 
               "Did he say when he should return?" 
               "No, madam." 
               Todd remained all this while a prisoner in his own parlor and it may easily be imagined how he chafed and fumed over such a state of things. If any convenient mode of taking the life of Mrs. Lovett had but presented itself to him, how gladly he would have embraced it; but none did; and after enduring the present state of affairs for about a quarter of an hour, he coolly opened the parlor door and walked into the shoo as if nothing was amiss. 
               Mrs. Lovett was not at all taken by surprise at this proceeding. She merely rose and took a step towards the door as she said in a cool sarcastic tone- 
               "I am glad you have come home." 
               "Come home?" said Todd, with a well-acted look of surprise. "Come home? What do you mean, my dear madam? I am particularly glad to see you and was particularly desirous to do so." 
               "Indeed!" 
               "Yes to be sure. Really, do you know I told the lad here to deny me to anybody but you." 
                
               "And he made the slight mistake of denying you to me only." 
               "Is it possible?-Can such things be? Oh, you careless rascal. Upon my word, some employers would pull your ears-that they would. I'm ashamed of you-that I am. Really Mrs. Lovett, these boys are always annoying one in some way or another; but walk in, if you please-walk in, and we will soon settle our little affairs." 
               "Excuse me," said Mrs. Lovett, "I prefer the shop Mr. Todd." 
               "You don't say so?" 
               "You hear me say so and you might know by this time that when I say anything I mean it." 
               "Of course, Mrs. Lovett, of course," said Todd; "I know you for a lady of infinite powers of mind-of great susceptibility-of feeling-of uncommon intellect and thrift. Please step in the parlor, and I will settle with you are entitled to from me, Mrs. Lovett." 
               "I do call for what I am entitled to, and I will have it here." 
               "Charley, just go to St. Dunstan's, my lad, and bring me word the exact time and then, you can do it all under one, you know, just walk down Fleet market and see if you can find any love-apples, and if so, you can ask the price of them, and let me know." 
               "Yes, sir," said Johanna and in another moment she was gone. 
               Mrs. Lovett took another step nearer to the door and actually laid her hand upon it to prevent it closing thoroughly. She did not think that she would he safe if it were shut; and them addressing Todd, she said- 
               "All disguise between you and I, is useless now, Todd. Give me my half of the money that has been earned by blood. It may have the curse of murder clinging to it, but I will have it-I say I will have it." 
               "Are you mad?" 
               "Not yet-not yet. But I shall be and then it will be time for you to beware of me." 
               "Mrs. Lovett-Mrs. Lovett, is it not a melancholy thing that you and I who may be said to be at war with all the world, should begin to quarrel with each other? If we are not true to one another, what can we expect from others? Have we not for so long carried on our snug little business in safety, merely because we were good friends?" 
               "No, Todd, no. We never were friends-you know that as well as I do. It is a principle of human nature, that those who are associated together for wicked purposes are never friends. You and I have not been exceptions to the rule. We hate each other-we always did and will, you know it." 
               "Dear, dear!" said Todd, lifting up his hands and approaching a step nearer to Mrs. Lovett. "This is afflicting-this is truly afflicting to hear such words from you, Mrs. Lovett." 
               "Keep off-keep off, I say! Another step and I will at once into the street, and then to the passer-by scream out for public vengeance upon Todd the murderer!" 
               "Hush!-hush! God of Heaven! woman, what do you mean of speaking of murder in such a tone? Have you gone mad in earnest? What do you mean by you care not? Has the scaffold any charms for you?" 
               "It might have for once with you for a companion on it, Sweeney Todd; but if I am desperate an reckless, you have yourself to thank for it. I have toiled and sinned, and murdered, for what you have done the same, for gold! We saw that it same for gold only that the rulers or the land struggled and fought, and we sought to possess ourselves of the idol. We took royal road to our object. We murdered for it, Todd. You dipped your hands in gore, and I helped you." 
               "Peace, woman." 
               "I will not hold my peace. The time has come for you to hear me, and I will make you do so. I will speak trumpet-tongued, and if you like not that word murder, I will shriek it in your ears. If you like not that word murder, I will on the house-tops proclaim and tell the people that it is synonymous with Todd. Ha! ha! you shrink now." 
               Todd did shrink aghast. This wild vehemence of Mrs. Lovett's was something that he did not expect. Every word filled him with alarm. He begun really to think that she had gone mad, and that he might have everything to dread from her wild vehemence, and that probably he had gone too far in cheating her out of the result of her labors. 
               "Peace," he said. "Peace, and you shall be satisfied. Step into the parlor, and I will write you an order for your half, and you can get it in half an hour." 
               "No, Todd. You will make the attempt to murder me if I step into the parlor. I will not even come further into your shop, than here upon the there should of it, with the door in my hand. Why do you keep a razor concealed in your sleeve?" 
               "Oh-I-it's a little habit of mine; but allow me to assure you how very incorrect your suspicions are, Mrs. Lovett; and if you will not come in, I will write the order, and bring it to you or what do you say to my going with you to the banker's where you can yourself ask what is the amount of the sum standing in my name there and when you have ascertained it, you can have half of it to a sixpence." 
               "Come, then. I confess, Todd I am sufficiently suspicious of you, that I would rather not lose sight of you." 
               At this moment, Johanna, who had not troubled herself to go to the market at all, came back. 
               "Well, what is the exact time by St. Dunstan's?" 
               "A quarter past eleven, sir." 
               "How very satisfactory. I am only going a little way with this lady, and will soon be back. You can keep up the fire, Charley, and in that corner you will find some religious tracts, which will, I hope, improve your mind. Above all things, my lad, never neglect your religious exercises. I hope you said your prayers last night, Charley?" 
               Todd glanced round the shop, to be certain that he had left everything as he wished it, and he tried the parlor door. Then he at once stalked into Fleet-street followed by Mrs. Lovett. 
               "It will look better for you to take my arm," he said. 
               "I don't care how it looks," she replied, "all I want is my money. Do not touch me, or you will see good cause shortly to repent having done so. Go on and I will follow you; but if you attempt to escape me, I will raise the street in pursuit of you by screaming out that you are Todd the Mur-" 
               "Hush-hush, woman. Do you know where you are?" 
               "Yes, in the street, but I do not care. All I want is my money, and I will have it." 
               "Curses on you and your money too," muttered Todd, as he crossed Fleet street and turned up Bridge street at a rapid pace. He passed all the turnings leading to the city, and kept on his way towards the bridge. 
               Mrs. Lovett followed him closely. "Stop!" she said, "stop! Whither are you going? this is not the way to the city." 
               "It is by the Thames." 
               "By the Thames?" 
               "Yes, I go by water; I do not wish to run the risk of meeting all sorts of people in the streets. I have not communicated to you that we are in great danger, but it is a fact. I do not now think that I shall get fairly off, but you will, if I am not interfered with before you get your money. By taking a boat at the stairs here by Blackfriars Bridge, we can be landed at a spot within about twenty yards of the banking house, which will be by far the safer route." 
               Mrs. Lovett did not much fancy the river excursion; but she considered that after all there would be a waterman in the boat, and that the river at that time of the day was populous, so she thought that Todd dared not attempt anything. 
               "Very well," she said, "so that we are quick, I care not." 
               "I am to the full," said Todd, "as anxious as you can be to get the job settled." 
               Mrs. Lovett thought that there was something ominous in the way in which he pronounced the word "job;" but then she thought perhaps she was too critical, and she followed him to the stairs by the side of the old bridge, certainly no without suspicions, but they were only general ones. The idea struck her, however, that she should be safer with two watermen, and she said- 
               "We will have two men, and by so doing we shall go quicker down the stream." 
               "So we shall," said Todd; "it is a good idea. Hilloa! first oars, here-first oars!" 
               "Here you are, sir," said a waterman. 
               "We want a couple of you," said Todd. 
               "Yes, your honor. Here we are-me and my mate. All's right your honor. Now, Bill, look alive. Mind the step, ma'am. That's yer sort. Where to, your honor?" 
               "To Pigs Quay." 
               "Ay, ay. Give way, Bill give way. A nice day for the water, yer honor; a fine fresh air, and not too much of it. Easy, Bill." 
               Both Todd and Mrs. Lovett were so much occupied in watching each other, that they did not perceive another boat push off from the same stairs at which they had embarked with two men in it, and which kept their wake pretty closely. The two watermen of Todd's boat, however, saw it, and they looked at each other, but they said nothing. They went upon the wise plan, that it was no business of theirs; and so they pulled away, while Todd glanced uneasily into the pale face of Mrs. Lovett. 
               The boat which followed Todd did not, after a time, keep quite in the wake of the one containing him and Mrs. Lovett; it rather went on a line parallel to it, but it kept at a convenient distance; and where were those in that boat who never took an eye off Todd and his female accomplice. 
               "I will not pay her," muttered Todd to himself, "If my refusal so to do brings us to the gallows!" 
               If Mrs. Lovett could have dived sufficiently deep into Todd's mind to be aware of this sentiment, she might have changed her tactics; but who could have thought it? Who could have supposed that any passion but self-preservation could master all others in his mind? 
               The two boats sped on towards London Bridge-not the elegant structure that now spans the Thames, but the previous one, with its narrow arched, and its dangerous fall of water when the tide was ebbing, which was the case upon this occasion. 
               The watermen looked uneasily at the arch through which it would be necessary to go and where the tide was raging with unexampled fury, and lashing the sides of the arch like a mill-stream, bearing upon its surface millions of bubbles, and making such a seething roaring sound, that it was a point of attraction to some idle chance passengers upon the bridge to watch any adventurous wherry as it shot through the dangerous passage. 
               "A rough tide, Bill," growled one of the watermen. 
               "Do you want to go through the bridge, master?" said the other. 
                
               "Yes," said Todd, "if the lady has no particular objection." 
               "Can we not land upon this side of the bridge?" said Mrs. Lovett. 
               "In course, ma'am," said one of the boatmen. "In course, ma'am." 
               "But," added Todd, hastily, "we must, then, until to-morrow, abandon the business upon which we came, as landing upon this side of the bridge will not suit me by any means." 
               "Pass through," cried Mrs. Lovett sternly. "I for one will not abandon the business upon which I came, except with my life. It is more than life to me, and I will go upon it, let it lead me where it may." 
               "And I," said Todd, in a voice of great indifference, "I too, am of precisely that opinion. So through the bridge we must go at any risk, if you, my men, will take us." 
               "Pull away, Bill," was the only reply of the waterman. "Pull away, Bill, and keep her steady. On we go." 
               No one spoke on board the boat. The watermen pulled very steady into the current, keeping over their shoulder a wary eye upon the head of the boat. Todd's eyes gleamed like two coats of fire, and Mrs. Lovett was as pale as death itself. 
               And now the little wherry was floating in the boiling surge that flew towards the arch, and made when it got there such a battle to get through. There was no occasion for pulling. The only good they could now do with their oars was to steady the little craft and so far as was possible to keep her head to the current. 
               "Easy, Bill," cried one of the men. 
               "Easy it is," said the other. 
               "You will upset us, my dear madame," said Todd, "if you move;" and then, while the two men were fully engaged with the boat, and by far too much occupied with the necessary movements for the preservation of themselves and their little craft, Todd, with one blow upon the head, struck Mrs. Lovett overboard. 
               She uttered a piercing shriek. 
               "What's that?-what's that?" cried the boatmen. 
               The boat scraped against the side of the arch for a moment, and then shot through it with a terrific bound into the comparatively still water on the other side of the bridge. 
               "I'm afraid," said Todd, "that the lady has fallen overboard." 
               "Afraid!" cried one of the watermen. "why, good God! don't you see she has; and there she goes along with the stream. Pull away, Bill; don't you see her? There she goes!" 
               "Alas, poor thing!" said Todd. 
               He affected to be overcome by his feelings, and to be compelled to rest his head upon his hands, while kept his hot-looking blood-shot eyes fixed upon the form of Mrs. Lovett in the water. 
               And now a scene ensued of deep interest to Todd-a scene which he watched with the greatest attention. It was a scene upon the issue of which he felt that his life depended. It Mrs. Lovett were saved, his life would not be worth an hour's purchase. If she were drowned, he was, so he fancied, a free man; and he saw that from the shore several boats put off after her, while the two men in his wherry pulled as though their lives depended upon hers. 
               Todd could have struck them for the exertions that they were making, but he dared not even speak one deprecating word to make them pause. He was condemned only to watch what was going on; and truly a most interesting scene it was. 
               Mrs. Lovett had on a large cloak, and it was by the aid of that, as well as by the strength of the current, that she floated so long as to make it quite remarkable, and to induce the opinion in the minds of some of the spectators 
                   
                     PORTRAIT OF SWEENEY TODD, FROM THE ORIGINAL IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM. 
                  
                   that she was swimming. Suddenly, just as a boat that had put off from the stairs by the Custom House reached her, down she went. 
               "Gone!" said Todd. 
               "Yes, she's gone," said one of the watermen. "She's gone, poor thing, whoever she was, and no one will get her now." 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXVIII. 
               Mr. Oakley misses Johanna-Sir Richard Blunt's Subterranean Expedition. 
               THE time at which Johanna had promised her father she would return had passed, and Mr. Oakley's anxiety in regard to her induced him to go to the house of Arabella Wilmot in pursuit of his daughter. Just as he was leaving the shop door, he was accosted by a neighbor with- 
               "Well, Oakley, what mad prank is that daughter of your's cutting up now?" 
               "What do you mean?" asked the spectacle-maker. 
               "I saw her in Fleet-street this morning, dressed in boy's clothing, and looking as gay as a London fop." 
               "You l-" 
               Lie, Oakley would have said, but he checked himself, and hurried to Arabella's, where he learned that Johanna had not been there. Mr. Oakley loved his daughter, and his grief at her loss was heart-reading. He raved, stamped, accused Arabella's aunt, who was the only person at home, of being a party to the deception which had deprived him of his child, and finally sank down upon the sofa and wept like a child. 
               It is something astonishing, and yet one of the most ordinary of mental phenomena, to note what a power a cool and clear intellect will exert over one that is distracted and full of woe and clamorous grief. Mr. Oakley did sit down by the side of Arabella's aunt, and he told her all that happened, the gist of which, of course, was the real or supposed appearance of Johanna in Fleet-street, in male attire. The collateral circumstances, such as the hurried and half-frantic farewell of him in the shop by Johanna, and the misrepresentation by Arabella, that she (Johanna) was going to stop there, evidently made a deep impression upon the aunt. Her countenance changed visibly, as she said faintly- 
               "God help us all." 
               "Lost, lost!" cried Oakley. "Yes, you-even, you, hopeful as you were, and hopeful as you would fain have made me-even you, now that you know all, feel that she is lost. God, indeed, only can help me now." 
               "No, Mr, Oakley," said the aunt, rallying, "I will not yet trust to appearances, although I own that they are bad. I will come to no conclusion until I have seen Arabella, and got the truth from her. It is quite clear that there in some secret between the two young creatures. It is quite clear that there is something going on that we know not of, and to speculate upon which may only involve us is an inextricable labyrinth of conjectures. I say, there is some secret, but it may not be a guilty one." 
               "Not-not guilty?" 
               "No, Mr. Oakley, there are many degrees of indiscretion to pass through ere the gulf of guilt is reached at last. I have faith in Arabella-I have faith in Johanna; and even now, admitting for a moment the truth of what that man whom you brought with you here reports, Johanna may only have to be blamed for folly." 
               "Do-do you think he did not see her?" 
               "I doubt it much." 
                
               "Mother," said a lad of fifteen, coming hastily into the room. "Mother, I-" 
               He paused upon seeing Mr. Oakley there, and stammered out some apology. 
               "He had only come to tell his mother that a whole suit of his clothes were missing from his room, and that he could find them nowhere, and he could not make it out; and once of his hats was gone too, and a pair of shoes, and-" 
               Old Oakley fell back in his chair with a groan. 
               "She has them," he said-"she has them. My child, whom I shall never see again, has them." 
               Mr. Oakley rushed from the house without his hat, his gray hair streaming in the wind, and almost the first person he met was Sir Richard Blunt. "Ha, Oakley, what has happened?" asked Sir Richard. 
               "My child! my child! Johanna is lost!" he sobbed rather than spoke. 
               "Johanna-your child, is safe, and under my care." 
               "God be thanked!" said the old man, "surely you would not deceive me." 
               "Surely not," replied the magistrate, "and if you will come to my office you shall be satisfied. But where's your hat?" 
               Mr. Oakley now, for the first time, missed his head covering and returning to Mr. Wilmot's, possessed himself of it, and accompanied Sir Richard to his office, where a full explanation of Johanna's conduct was given him, and he returned home, not doubting Sir Richard's promise that he should see her again. 
               As soon as Sir Richard had disposed of Mr. Oakley, he hastened to St. Dunstan's church, where his men were waiting. He had set apart this morning to attempt to discover, what he had no doubt existed, a connection between Sweeney Todd's shop and the cellar where Mrs. Lovett's cook was immured. He found his men waiting, and on his approach one of them said-"I have made all the necessary observations, Sir Richard, and am quite easy and confident that I can direct you how to excavate directly to Todd's house." 
               "Thank you, Sir Christopher," said the magistrate. "I am much indebted to you for the trouble you have taken in this affair, which is now near its climax." 
               "I hope so, Sir Richard. This way, if you please." 
               The whole party now proceeded to the same slab of stone which the magistrate had before removed, and at once made the way into the vaults, and by dint of keeping to the right hand, they avoided going much out of their course. These vaults were of great extent, and although some of them, owing to being full of the dead, had been bricked up, yet they were very easily opened, and in many cases a direct thoroughfare for considerable distances was affected. 
               Ever and anon a compass was appealed to, and showed they were approaching Todd's house. 
               One of the party, a well-dressed gentlemanly-looking man, now stepped forward and said to Sir Richard- 
               "Here, according to the plans of the church, the vaults end." 
               "Then," said Sir Richard, "here commences in reality our mission, which is to try to discover some communication between the lower part of the house occupied by Sweeney Todd, and these vaults." 
               He lighted for himself a small lantern, and commenced a rigorous search of the walls, but for some few minutes could find nothing to excite the least suspicion. At length he paused at one portion of one of the vaults, where a kind of wooden tomb had been erected close to the wall. A large piece of dirty oak was placed upright against the earth-work. 
               "If there be any mode of leaving this vault but the one we have entered," he said, "it is here." 
                
               "What leads you to suppose, Sir Richard," said the architect, "that this place will show us anything?" 
               "This," said the magistrate, as he picked up from amid the rubbish of the broken monument, a nearly new glove of thick leather. "How did this get here?" 
               The glove was passed from hand to hand and duly examined. No one owned it, and the only remark that could be make upon it was, that it was of as immense size. 
               "Then," said Sir Richard Blunt, "since it belongs to none of us, I give it as my opinion that it belongs to Sweeney Todd, and has fallen from his hand in this place." 
               The crow-bar was handed to Sir Richard Blunt, and at one touch with it down came the piece of oak that was against the wall. That was conclusive, for, instead of the same wall beyond it, there was a deep crevice or opening just sufficient to enable one person to go through it. 
               "This is the place," said the magistrate. 
               There was a death-like silence among all present. Every ear was on the stretch, and every eye was fixed upon the narrow opening in the wall of the vault. It would almost seem as though every one expected to see Sweeney Todd to appear with one of his victims on his back that he had just, to use his own phraseology, succeeded in polishing off. 
               Sir Christopher stuck up his compass again, and it was his voice that first broke the stillness. 
               "The route is direct," he said. 
               "To Todd's house?" asked Sir Richard. 
               "Yes, direct." 
               "Then all we have got to do is to follow." 
               "Come on," said the magistrate. "Come on." 
               It required no small amount of real courage to lead the way in that expedition into the very bowels of the earth as it were; but with the small lantern elevated as far above his head as the roof of the passage would admit of, Sir Richard stepped slowly and cautiously on. 
               The excavation in which they were was roughly but well made. At intervals of about twelve feet each, there always occurred two upright pieces of plank supporting a third piece on the roof, and firmly wedged in, so that there was but little likelihood of a fall of earth from above. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXIX. 
               Result of Sir Richard's Expedition. 
               AFTER going on for about twenty paces further, Sir Richard found a door completely blocking up the passage. By dint of careful investigation of it, he found it was locked, and the key in the other side of the lock. He pushed it through with some difficulty, and then, with a skeleton key, opened the door in the course of a few moments, and they found themselves in some regularly constructed vaults, arched with stone, down the sides of which there rolled long streams of moisture. At first it was no easy matter to find any kind of outlet from the place. After some searching, however, another door was discovered, very similar indeed to the one that Sir Richard Blunt had opened with the picklock, and that, too, was found to be locked on the other side, and the key, as in the former case, in the lock. 
               "All this locking of doors," said the magistrate, "was, I have no sort of doubt, to protect himself from any night visit upon the part of Mrs. Lovett, from which I feel certain that Sweeney Todd has been expecting attempts upon his life, as much to my own knowledge he has made attempts upon hers; but by some kind of fatality, or providence, they seem unable to harm each other." 
               The door which was now opened, only led to some other vaults. Some old boots occupied a place in one corner, and Some old hats and other articles of clothing were lying in a confused heap in another. Sir Richard Blunt looked upon all this as ample testimony that he was quite close to the abode of Sweeney Todd, and he accordingly turned to his friends, saying- 
               "It is necessary that we proceed with the utmost caution. I think a very few steps will take us into the cellars of Todd's house, and the object now is not by any means to give him the least alarm, but merely to find out, if possible, by what means he murders and disposes of his victims." 
               Acting upon this caution, they extinguished all the lights, with the exception of one lantern, and that Sir Richard Blunt himself carried, as he still continued he head the expedition. Suddenly he came upon an arched doorway without a door; and hardly had he proceeded a few paces, when he saw something lying in a strange confused mass upon the floor, which, upon a closer examination, proved to be a dead body lying upon some stones, that seemed to have been placed one upon another in such a position that their most jagged corners and uneven surface should be uppermost. A glance at the roof showed a square black-looking hole. 
               Sir Richard Blunt was upon the point of saying something, when overhead they heard the distinct tramp of a man. The magistrate immediately placed his finger upon his lips, and all was as still as the grave in that place. Presently they heard a voice, and they all knew that it was the voice of Sweeney Todd. It came from above, and reached their ears with a sufficient clearness to enable them to catch the words- 
               "Her death is certain if I can get her to cross the threshold of this parlor!" 
               There was another small door-way a little to the left of where he stood, and Sir Richard, upon the impulse of the moment, passed through it alone. He came back again in a moment. 
               "Gentlemen," he whispered, "have we seen enough?" 
               They nodded, and without another word, he led the way back again from the dreary subterranean abode of murder. 
               "The less that is said about what we have been here, the better it will be. Let me beg of every one not to give the smallest hint to any one, even in the most confidential manner, of the discoveries that have been made here to-day." 
               An immediate assent was of course given to this proposition, and in the course of five minutes they were all in St. Dunstan's church. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXX. 
               Johanna has plenty of company-Todd's hour is come. 
               WE return to Johanna, whom for a few hours, owing to the pressure of other circumstances, we have been compelled, with all manner of reluctance, to neglect. Recent events, although they had by no manner of means tended to decrease the just confidence which Johanna had in her own safety, had yet much agitated her; and she at times feared that she should not be able to carry on the farce of composure before Todd much longer. 
               "Charley, my dear boy," said Todd, "you are a very good lad, indeed, and I like you." 
               "I am very glad to hear you say so sir-very glad." 
               "That is right; but when I say I like any one, I do not confine myself of that mere expression of liking, and there an end. Of course, as a religions man, I love my enemies, and feel myself bound to do so-eh, Charley?" 
                
               "How kind of you, sir!" 
               "I am glad you appreciate it, Charley; and I feel quite sure that your slumber will be most profound." 
               Todd upon this made one of his diabolical faces, and then, taking his hat, he marched out, merely adding as he crossed the threshold of the door- 
               "I shall not be long gone, Charley." 
               "I am alone once more," said Johanna, "in this dreadful place. Again he leaves me with all my dark and terrible thoughts of the fate of him whom I have so fondly loved thronging around my heart; and this night, no doubt, he thinks to kill me! O, Mark Ingestrie! if I were only but quite sure that you had gone to that world from whence there is no return, I think I could with scarce a sigh, let this dreadful man send me after you!" 
               Johanna rested her head upon her hands, and wept bitterly. Suddenly a voice close to her said- 
               "St. Dunstan." 
               She sprang from the little low seat upon which she was, and, with a cry of alarm, was about to rush from the shop, when the intruder caught her by the arm, saying- 
               "Don't you know me, Johanna?" 
               "Ah, Sir Richard! my dear friend, it is indeed you, and I am safe again-I am safe!" 
               "Certainly you are safe; and permit me to say that you have all along been tolerably safe, Johanna. But how very incautious you are. Here I have come into the shop, and actually stood by you for some few moments, you knowing nothing of it! What now if Todd had so come in?" 
               "He would have killed me." 
               "He might have done so. But now all danger is quite over, for you will have protectors at your hand. Do you know where Todd has gone?" 
               "I do not." 
               "Well, it don't matter. Let me look at this largest cupboard. I wonder if it will hold two of my men? Let me see. O, yes, easily and comfortably. I will be back in a moment." 
               He went no farther than the door, and when he came back, he brought with him Mr. Crotchet and another person, and pointing to the cupboard, he said- 
               "You will slow yourselves there, if you please, and keep quiet until I call upon you to come out." 
               Upon this, Mr. Crotchet and the other man got into the cupboard, and a chair was placed against it; and then Sir Richard said to Johanna- 
               "I will come in to be shaved when I know that Todd is here, and your trials will soon be over." 
               "To be shaved?-by him?" 
               "Believe me there is no danger. Any one may come here to be shaved now with perfect safety. I have made such arrangements that Todd cannot take another life." 
               "Farewell now, for a brief space. We shall very soon meet again! Keep a fair and agreeable face to Todd, if you can, for I do not wish, if it can possibly be helped, anything to mar the plot I have got up for his absolute conviction upon abundant testimony." 
               Sir Richard shook hands with Johanna, and then hastily left the shop, for he did not wish just then to be found there by Todd, who might return at any moment. 
               "Alas! alas!" mourned Johanna, "My mind is full of horrible surmises, and yet I can form no rational conjecture. I suspect everything, and know nothing. What can I do? What ought I to do, to relive myself from this state of horrible suspense? Am I really in a place where, by some frightful ingenuity, murder has become bold and familiar, or can it be all a delusion?" 
               She covered her face with her hands for a time, and when she uncovered them, she saw that Sweeney Todd had returned, and was staring at her with looks of suspicion. The necessity of instantly acting her part came over Johanna, and she gave a loud scream. 
               "What the devil is all this about?" said Todd, advancing with a sinister expression. "What the meaning of it? I suspect--" 
               "Yes, sir," said Johanna, "and so do I; I must to-morrow have it out." 
               "Have what out?" 
               "My tooth, sir-it's been aching for some hours; did you ever have the toothache? if you did, you can feel for me, and not wonder that I lean my head upon my hands and groan." 
               Todd looked about half satisfied at this excuse of Johanna's, and for a few moments as he looked at her, she thought that after all she should have to call upon her friends in the cupboard to save her from the danger that his eyes, in their flashing ghastliness, threatened. Another moment, and her lips would have parted with the shrill cry of "Murder!" upon them, and then Heaven only knows what might have been the result; but he turned suddenly, and went into the parlor, muttering to himself- 
               "It is not worth while now, and this ends it all-yes, this night ends it all." 
               Todd remained for a considerable time in the parlor; and when he came out, Johanna saw that he had made some alteration in his apparel. The first words he uttered were- 
               "Keep a good fire, Charley." 
               "Yes, sir." 
               "Did you ever see a house on fire, my boy?" 
               "I never did, sir." 
               "Ah! It must be an amusing sight-a very amusing sight, especially if the conflagration spreads, and one has an opportunity of viewing it from the water. Talking of water, the lady who was here this morning-Mrs. Lovett-was very fond of water, and now she has plenty of it. Ah!" 
               "Really, sir? Has she gone to the sea-side?" 
               Johanna looked Todd rather hard in the face as she spoke these words, and the close observation seemed to anger him, for he spoke hastily and sharply- 
               "What is it to you? Get out of my way, will you? and you may begin to think of shutting up, I think, for we shall have no more customers to-night." 
               Todd, as he spoke, advanced towards the cupboard, and Johanna thought that in another moment a discovery would undoubtedly take place of the two officers who were there concealed; and probably that would have been the case, had not the handle of the shop door been turned at that moment and a man presented himself, when Todd turned quickly, and saw that he was a substantial-looking farmer, with dirty top-boots, as if he had just come off a journey. 
               "Well, master," said the visitor, "I wants a clean shave." 
               "O," said Todd, not in the best of humors, "it's rather late; but I suppose you would not like to wait till morning, for I don't know if I have any hot water." 
               "O, cold will do." 
               "Cold? O, dear no; we never shave in cold water; and if you must, you must; so sit down, sir, and we will soon settle the business." 
               "Thank you, thank you. I can't go to bed comfortable without a clean shave, do you see? I have come up from Braintree with beasts on commission, and I'm staying at the Bull's Head, you see." 
               "O, indeed," said Todd, as he adjusted the shaving cloth, "The Bull's Head." 
               "Yes, master; why I brought up a matter o' 220 beasts, I did, do you see, and was on my pooney, as good a stepper as you'd wish to see; and I sold 'em all, do you see, for 550 pun. Ho, ho! good work that, do you see, and only forty-two on 'em was my beasts, do you see; I've got a missus at home, and a daughter; my girl's called Johanna-a-hem!" 
               Up to this point Johanna had not suspected that the game had begun, and that this was no other than Sir Richard himself, most admirably disguised, who had come to put an end to the mal-practises of Sweeney Todd; but his marked pronunciation of her name at once opened her eyes to that fact, and she knew that something interesting must soon happen. 
               "And so you sold them all?" said Todd. 
               "Yes, master, I did, and I've got the money in my pocket now, in bank-notes; I never leaves my money about at inns, do you see, master; safe bind, safe find, you see; I carries it about with me." 
               "A good plan, too," said Todd. "Charley, some hot water, that's a good lad; and-and-Charley, while I am finishing off this gentleman, you may as well just run to the Temple to Mr. Serjeant Toldrun's and ask for his wig; we shall have to do it in the morning, and may as well have it the first thing in the day to begin upon; and you need not hurry, Charley, as we shall shut up when you come back." 
               "Very good, sir." 
               Johanna walked out, but went no further than the shop window, close to which she placed her eyes, so that, between a pomatum jar and a lot of hair brushes, she could clearly see what was going on. 
               "A nice looking little lad that," said Todd's customer. 
               "Very, sir; an orphan boy: I took him out of charity, poor little fellow; but then we ought to try to do all the good we can." 
               "Just so: I'm glad I have come to be shaved here. Mine's rather a strong beard I think, do you see." 
               "Why, sir, in a manner of speaking," replied Todd, "it is a strong beard. I suppose you didn't come to London alone, sir?" 
               The hideous face that Todd made above the head of his customer at this moment, was more like that which Mephistopheles might have made, after achieving the destruction of human soul, than anything human. Sir Richard Blunt quickly replied to Todd's question, by saying- 
               "O, yes, quite alone; except the drovers I had no company with me: why do you ask?" 
               "Why, sir, I thought if you had any gentleman with you who might be waiting at the Bull's Head, you would recommend him to me if anything was wanting in my way, you know, sir; you might have just left him, saying you were going to Todd, the barber's, to have a clean shave, sir." 
               "No, not at all: the fact is, I did not come out to have a shave, but a walk, and it wasn't till I gave my chin a stroke, and found what a beard I had, that I thought of it; and then passing your shop, in I popped, do you see." 
               "Exactly, sir, I comprehend; you are quite alone in London?" 
               "O, quite; but when I come again, I'll come to you to be shaved, you may depend, and I'll recommend you, too." 
               "I'm very much obliged to you," said Todd, as he passed his hand over the chin of his customer. "I'm very much obliged; I find I must give you another lather, sir, and I'll get another razor with a keener edge, now that I have taken off all the rough, as one may say, in a manner of speaking." 
               "O, I shall do." 
               "No, no, don't move, sir, I shall not detain you a moment; I have my other razors in the next room, and will polish you off now sir, before you will know where you are; you know, sir, you have promised to recommend me, so I must do the best I can with you." 
               Sweeney Todd walked into his back-parlor, conveying with him the only light that was in the shop. The moment his back was turned, the seeming farmer, who had made such a good thing of his beasts, sprang from the shaving chair, as if he had been electrified; and yet he did not do it with any appearance of fright, nor did he make any noise. 
                
               In the space of about a quarter of a minute, there came from the next room a sound like the rapid drawing back of a heavy bolt, and then in an instant, the shaving chair disappeared beneath the floor; and the circumstances by which Sweeney Todd's customers disappeared was evident. There was apiece of the flooring turning upon a centre, and the weight of the chair, when a bolt was withdrawn by means of simple leverage from the inner door, weighed down one end of the top, which, by a little apparatus, was to swing completely round, there being another chair on the under surface, which thus became the upper, exactly resembling the one in which the unhappy customer was supposed to be "polished off." 
               Hence was it that in one moment, as if by magic, Sweeney Todd's visitors disappeared, and there was the empty chair. No doubt, he trusted to a fall of about twenty feet below on to a stone floor, to be the death of them, or, at all events, to stun them until he could go down and finish the murder, and-to cut them up for Mrs. Lovett's pies! after robbing them of all the money and valuables they might have about them. 
               In another moment, the sound as of a bolt was again heard, and Sir Richard Blunt, who had played the part of the wealthy farmer, feeling that the trap was closed again, seated himself in the new chair that had made its appearance, with all the nonchalance in life, as if nothing had happened. It was a full minute before Todd ventured to look from the parlor into the darkened ship, and then he shook so that he had to hold by the door to steady himself. 
               "That's done," he said. "That's the last, I hope. It is time I finished; I never felt so nervous since the first time. Then I did quake a little. How quiet he went; I have sometimes had a shriek ringing in my ears for a whole week." 
               It was a large high-backed piece of furniture, that shaving chair, so that when Todd crept into the shop, with the light in his hand, he had not the remotest idea that it was tenanted; but when he got round it, and saw his customer calmly waiting, with the lather upon his face, the cry of horror that came gurgling and gushing from his throat, was horrible to hear. 
               "Why, what's the matter?" said Sir Richard. 
               "O God, the dead! the dead! O God!" cried Todd. "This is the beginning of my punishment. Have mercy, Heaven! oh, do not look upon me with those dead eyes." 
               "Murderer!" shouted Sir Richard, in a voice that rung like the blast of a trumpet through the house. 
               In an instant he sprang upon Sweeney Todd, and grappled him by the throat. There was a short struggle, and they were down upon the floor together, but Todd's wrists were suddenly laid hold of, and a pair of hand-cuffs most scientifically put upon him by the officers who, at the world "murderer," that being a preconcerted signal, came from the cupboard, where they had been concealed. 
               "Secure him well, my men," said the magistrate, "and don't let him lay violent hands upon himself." 
               Johanna rushed into the shop, and clung to the arm of Sir Richard, crying- 
               "Is it all over? Is it indeed all done now?" 
               "It is, Miss Oakley." 
               The moment Todd heard these few words addressed to Charley Green, as he thought him, he turned his glassy, bloodshot eyes upon Johanna, and glared at her for the space of about half a minute in silence. He then, although hand-cuffed, made a sudden and violent effort to reach her, but he was in too experienced hands, and he was held back most effectually. 
               He struck his forehead with his fettered hands, making a gash in it, from which the blood flowed freely, as in infuriated accents, he said- 
                
               "O fool-fool, to be cheated by a girl! I had my suspicions that the boy was a spy, but I never thought for one moment there was a disguise of sex. O idiot! And who are you, sir?" 
               "I am Sir Richard Blunt!" 
               Todd groaned and staggered. The officers would have let him sit down in the shaving chair for a moment or two, recover from the shock his mind had sustained by his capture, but when he found that it was the shaving chair he was led to, he shuddered, and in a wailing voice, said- 
               "No-no! not there! Anywhere but there. I dare not sit there!" 
               We cannot transcribe the horrible denunciations of Todd, They were too horrible even for the officers to listen to, with patience, and Sir Richard Blunt, turning to Crotchet, said- 
               "Shut up the shop, and then get a coach. I will lodge this man at once in Newgate, and then we will see to Mrs. Lovett." 
               At this name, Todd looked up. 
               "She has escaped you," he said. 
               "I don't think so, "responded Sir Richard. 
               "But I say she has-she is dead; she fell into the Thames this morning, and was drowned." 
               "O, you allude to your pushing her into the river, this morning, near London bridge!" said Sir Richard. "I saw that affair myself." 
               Todd glared at him. 
               "But it was not of much consequence. We got her out, and she is all right again now at her shop, in Bell-yard.' 
               Todd held his hands over his eyes for some moments, and then he said, in a low voice- 
               "It is all a dream, or I am mad." 
               The spirit to struggle was gone from Todd, for the time being. Indeed, he seemed to be completely stunned by his capture, and to be able only to see things darkly. He was yet to awaken to a full consciousness of his situation, and let that awakening be when it would, it was sure to be awful. 
               "All's right," said Crotchet!" "Here's the vehicle, and the crib is shut up." 
               "Crotchet!" 
               "Yes, your worship. What is it? Why, you never looked at a feller in that sort of a way before!" 
               "I never did have anything so important to say to you, Crotchet," said Sir Richard; "nor did I ever place in your hands, so important a trust. It is one that will make you or mar you, Crotchet. I have myself important business here, or I would take this man to Newgate. As it is, Crotchet, I wish to entrust you with that important piece of duty, and I rely upon you, Crotchet, for keeping an eye upon him, and delivering him in safety." 
               "It's as good as done," said Crotchet. "If he gets away from me, he has only another individual to do, and that's the old gent, as is down below, with the long tail." 
               "I entrust you with him then, Crotchet. Take him away!" 
               He then, by an immense exertion of strength, hoisted Todd completely over the door-step, after which, catching him with both hands, about the small of his back, he pitched him into the coach. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXXI. 
               Mrs. Lovett at home. 
               BUT we must leave Todd, and hasten to Bell-yard again. 
               Mrs. Lovett's immersion in the Thames, had really not done her much harm, and she soon settled in her own mind a plan of action, notwithstanding the rather complicated and embarrassing circumstances in which she found herself placed. That plan of action had for its basis, the impeachment of Todd, as a murderer, at the same time that it looked forward to her own escape from the hands of justice. Her first action was to quiet the cook, in the regions below, for if she did not take some such step, she was very much afraid her establishment would come to a stand-still, some few hours before she intended that it should do so. 
               With this object, she wrote upon a little slip of paper, the following words and passed it into the cellar through an almost imperceptible crevice in the flooring of the shop- 
               "Early to-morrow morning you shall have your liberty, together with gold, to take you where you please. All I require of you is, that you do your ordinary duty to-night, and send up the nine o'clock batch of pies." 
               This, she considered, could not but have its due effect upon the discontented cook; and having transmitted it to him in the manner we have described, of an hour, Mrs. Lovett had filled two pages of writing paper with a full account of how persons met their death in the barber's shop. She sealed the letter, and directed it to sir Richard Blunt, in a bold, free hand. 
               "It is done," she said. "When I am far from London, as I can easily find the means of being, this will reach the hands of the magistrate to whom it is addressed, and who has the character of being sharp and active," (Mrs. Lovett did not know how sharp and active Sir Richard had already been in to affairs!) "He will act upon it. Todd, in the midst of his guilt, with many evidences of it about him, will be taken, and I shall escape! Yes, I shall escape, with about a tithe of what I ought to have-but I shall have revenge!" 
               On one of the shelves of the shop-certainly out of reach, but only just so-stood an old dirty-looking tin jar, such as fancy biscuits night be kept in. No one for a moment would have thought of looking for anything valuable in such a place; and yet, keeping the shop-door locked the while, lest any intruder should at unawares pop in and see what she was about, it was to this tin can upon its dirty shelf that Mrs. Lovett cautiously went. 
               "Those who can hide, can find," she muttered, "I warrant now that Todd had searched in every seemingly cunning and intricate hiding-place in this whole house, and he has gone away disappointed. The secret of hiding anything is not to try to find some place where people may be baffled when they look, but to light upon some place into which they will not look at all." 
               With these words, Mrs. Lovett took down the tin can, and, having from the upper portion of it removed some dusty, mouldy biscuits, she dived her hand into it, and fished up a leathern bag. The tape that held its mouth together was sealed, and a glance sufficed to convince Mrs. Lovett that it had not been touched. 
               "Safe, safe!" she muttered. "It is but a thousand pounds, but it is safe, and it will enable me to fly from this place-it will enable me to have vengeance upon Todd; and, small as the sum is, in some country where money is worth more than it is in pampered England, I shall yet be able to live upon it. I will not complain If I have but the joy of reading an account of the execution of Todd. I fear I must deny myself the pleasure of seeing that sight." 
               The little leathern bag she hid about her, and then she carefully replaced the tin case upon the shelf whence she had taken it to disburden it of its costly contents. 
               After this Mrs. Lovett got much calmer. She sat behind her counter looking only a shade or so paler than was her wont, and moving her lips slightly now and then she settled in her own mind the course that she would take to baffle all pursuit. 
                
               "With no luggage but my gold and notes," she muttered, "I will leave this place at half-past nine, by which time the last batch of pies will have been up and sold, and all will be quiet. That will be a little more money to me, and, by one conveyance and another, I can reach Liverpool, from which port I shall find some vessel starting to some place abroad, where I can live free from the chance of detection. Yes, that is the plan! That is the plan!" 
               Mrs. Lovett was a woman of some tact, and the plan of operations she had chalked out was all very well, provided such very malapropos proceedings had not taken place at Sweeney Todd's in the meantime. Little did Mrs. Lovett suspect what was there transpiring. 
               And now we will leave her for a brief space behind her counter, while we pop down to the cellars, and take a glance at the impatient imprisoned cook. 
               About ten minutes before he received the letter from his mistress, the cook had been a little alarmed by a noise in the stone pantry, where the mysterious meat used to make its appearance. Upon proceeding to the spot with a light, he found lying upon the floor a sealed paper, addressed to himself, and at one corner was written the following words: 
               "Definite instructions for to-night from Sir Richard Blunt." 
               To tear open the letter, and to read it with great care, was the work of a few moments only, and then drawing a long breath, the cook said: 
               "Thank God! I shall not stop another night in this place. I shall be free before midnight. Oh, what an oppressive-what an overpowering joy it will be to me once more to see the sky-to breathe pure fresh air, and to feel that I have bid adieu forever to this dreadful-dreadful place!" 
               The poor cook looked around him with a shudder, and then he had hardly placed the magistrate's letter securely in his bosom, when the little missive from Mrs. Lovett came fluttering to his feet, through the crack in the roof. 
               "'Tis well," he said, when he had read it. "'Tis very well. This will chime in most admirably with my instructions from Sir Richard Blunt. Mrs. Lovett, I thank you; you shall have the nine o'clock batch. Oh, yes, you shall have them! I am all obedience. Alas, if she whom I loved had not been false to me, I might yet, young as I am, feel the sunshine of joy in the great world again. But I can never love another, and she is lost-lost to me forever! Ay, forever!" 
               With this the poor cook, who, a few moments before had been so elated by the thoughts of freedom, sat himself down, and in quite a desolate manner rested his head upon his hands, and gave himself up to bitter fancy. 
               "That she should be false to me!" he said, mournfully. "It does indeed almost transcend belief. She, so young, so gentle, so innocent, and so guileless! If an angel from heaven had come and told me as much, I should have doubted still; but I cannot mistrust the evidences of my own senses. I saw her; yes, I saw her!" 
               The cook rose and paced the gloomy place to and fro in the restlessness of a blighted heart, and no one, to look at him, could for a moment have supposed that he was near his freedom from an imprisonment of the most painful and maddening description to one of his impatient temperament. But so it is with us all; no sooner do we, to all appearance, see the end of one evil, than with an activity of imagination, worthy to be excited in better things, we provide ourselves with some real or unreal reason for the heart-ache. 
               "I will so contrive," said the cook, "that before a I leave forever the land of my birth, I will once more look upon her. Yes, I will once again drink in, from a contemplation of her wondrous beauty, most delicious poison; and then, when I have feasted my eyes, and perchance grieved my heart, I will at once go far away, and beneath the sun of other skies than this, I will wait for death." 
                
               The more the poor cook thought of this unknown beauty of his, who surely had behaved to him very ill, or he could not have spoken of her in such terms, the more sorrow got upon his countenance, and imparted its sad sweetness to his tones. Surely the time had not been very far distant when that young man must have been in a widely different sphere of life to that limited one in which he now moved. 
               Suddenly, however, he was recalled to a consciousness of what he had to do, by the clock striking seven. He counted the strokes, and pausing before one of the large ovens, he said- 
               "The time has now come when I must cease to be making preparations to obey the mandate of my imperious mistress, She will not now be content merely to have issued her orders, but she will keep an eye upon me to see that they are being executed, and, unarmed as I am, and without the knowledge of what power of mischief she may have, I feel that it would not be safe yet to provoke her. No, no; I must seem to do her bidding." 
               With this the cook set about the manufacture of the pies; and, as it would really have been much more troublesome to sham making them than to make them in earnest, he really did manufacture a hundred of them. 
               One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine! Yes, it is nine at last. It strikes by old St. Dunstan's church clock; in weaker strains the chronometrical machine at the pie-shop echoes the sound. What an excitement there is to get at the pies when they shall come! Mrs. Lovett lets down the square movable platform that goes on pullies in the cellar; some machinery, which only requires a handle to be turned, brings up a hundred pies in a tray. These are eagerly seized by parties who have previously paid, and such a smacking of lips ensues as never was known. 
               Down goes the platform for the next hundred, and a gentlemanly man says- 
               "Let me work the handle, Mrs. Lovett, if you please; it's too much for you, I'm sure." 
               "Sir, you are very kind, but I never allow anybody on this side of the counter but my own people, sir. I can turn the handle myself, sir, if you please, with the assistance of this girl. Keep your distance, sir; nobody wants your help." 
               "But, my dear madam, only consider your delicacy. Really ought not to be permitted to work away like a negro slave at a winch handle. Really you ought not." 
               The man who spoke thus obligingly to Mrs. Lovett, was tall and stout, and the lawyer's clerks repressed the ire they otherwise would probably have given utterance to at thus finding any one quizzing their charming Mrs. Lovett. 
               "Sir, I tell you again that I don't want your help: keep your distance, sir, if you please." 
               "Now don't get angry, fair one," said the man. "You don't know but I might have made you an offer before I left the shop." 
               "Sir," said Mrs. Lovett, drawing herself up, and striking terror into the hearts of the limbs of the law,-"sir, what do you want? Say what you want, and be served, sir, and then go. Do you want a pie, sir?" 
               "A pie? Oh, dear no; I don't want a pie; I would not eat one of the nasty things on any account. Pah!" Here the man spat on the floor. "Oh, dear, don't ask me to eat any of your pies." 
               "Shame! shame!" said several of the lawyers' clerks. 
               "Will any gentleman who thinks it a shame, be so good as to step forward and say so a little closer?" 
               Everybody shrunk back upon this, instead of accepting the challenge; and Mrs. Lovett soon saw that she must, despite all the legal chivalry by which she was surrounded, fight her battles herself. With a look of vehement anger, she cried- 
                
               "Beware, sir, I am not to be trifled with. If you carry your jokes too far, you will wish that you had not found your way, sir, into this shop." 
               "That, madam," said the tall stout man, "is not surely possible, when I have the beauty of a Mrs. Lovett to gaze upon, and render the place so exquisitely attractive; but if you will not permit me to have the pleasure of helping you up with the next batch of pies, which, after all, you may find heavier than you expect, I must leave you to do it yourself." 
               "So that I am not troubled any longer by you, sir, at all," said Mrs. Lovett, "I don't care how heavy the next batch of pies may happen to be, sir." 
               "Very good, madam." 
               Mrs. Lovett at once applied herself to the windlass, which worked up the little platform, upon which a whole tray of a hundred pies was went to come up, and began to turn it with what might be called a vengeance. 
               How very strange it was-surely the words of the tall, stout, impertinent stranger, were prophetic, for never before had Mrs. Lovett found what a job it was to work that handle, as upon that night. The axle creaked, and the cords and pullies strained and wheezed, but she was a determined woman, and she worked away at it. 
               "I told you so, my dear madam," said the stranger; "it is more evidently than you can do." 
               "Peace, sir!" 
               "I am done; work away, ma'am, only don't say afterwards that I did not offer to help you that's all." 
               Indignation was swelling at the heart of Mrs. Lovett, but she felt that it she wasted her breath upon the impertinent stranger, she would have none for the windlass; so, setting her teeth, she fagged at it with a strength and a will, that if she had not been in a right royal passion, she could not have brought to bear upon it on any account. 
               There was quite an awful stillness in the shop. All eyes were bent upon Mrs. Lovett, and the cavity through which the next batch of those delicious pies were coming. Those who had the good fortune to get one of the first lot, had only had their appetites heightened by the luxurious feast they had partaken of, while those who had as yet none, actually licked their lips, and snuffled up the delightful aroma from the remains of the first batch. 
               "Two for me, Mrs. Lovett," cried a voice. "One veal for me;"-"three porks;"-"one pork." 
               The voices grew fast and furious. 
               "Silence!" cried the tall stout man. "I will engage that everybody shall be fully satisfied, and no one shall leave here without a thorough conviction that his wants in pies has been more than attended to." 
               The platform could be made to stop at any stage of its upward progress, by means of a ratchet wheel and a catch, and now Mrs. Lovett paused to take breath. She attributed the difficulty in working the machinery to her own weakness, contingent upon her recent immersion in the Thames. 
               "Sir," she said between her clenched teeth, addressing the man who was such an eyesore to her in the shop. "Sir, I don't know who you are, but I hope to be able to show you when I have served these gentlemen, that even I am not to be insulted with impunity." 
               "Anything you please, madam," he replied, "in a small way, only don't exert yourself too much." 
               Mrs. Lovett flew to the windlass again, and from the manner in which she worked at it, it was quite clear that when she had had her hands free from that job, she fully intended to make good her threats against the tall stout man. The young beardless scions of the law, trembled at the idea of what might happen. 
               And now the tops of the pies appeared. Then they saw the rim of the large tray upon which they were, and then just as the platform itself was level with the floor of the shop, up flew tray and pies, as if something had exploded beneath them, and a tall slim man sprung upon the counter. It was the cook, who, from the cellar beneath, had laid himself as flat as he could beneath the tray of pies, and so had been worked up to the shop by Mrs. Lovett. 
               "Gentlemen," he cried, "I am Mrs. Lovett's cook. The pies are made of human flesh!" 
                
               We shrink, we tremble at the idea of attempting to describe the scene that ensued in the shop of Mrs. Lovett, contingent upon this frightful apparition, and still more frightful speech of the cook; but duty-our duty to the public-requires that we should say something upon the occasion. 
               If we can do nothing more, we can briefly enumerate what did actually take place in some instances. 
               About twenty clerks rushed into Bell Yard, and there and there and then, to the intense surprise of the passers-by, became intensely sick. The cook, with one spring, cleared the counter, and alighted amongst the customers, and, with another spring, the tall impertinent man, who had made many remarks to Mrs. Lovett of an aggravating tendency, cleared the counter likewise in the other direction, and, alighting close to Mrs. Lovett, he cried- 
               "Madam, you are my prisoner." 
               For a moment, and only for a moment, the great-the cunning-and the redoubtable Mrs. Lovett, lost her self-possession, and, staggering back, she lurched heavily against the glass-case next to the wall, immediately behind the counter. It was only for a moment, though, that such an effect was produced upon Mrs. Lovett; and then, with a spring like an enraged tigress, she caught up a knife that was used for slipping under the pies and getting them cleanly out of the little tins, and rushed upon the tall stranger. 
               Yes, she rushed upon him; but, for once in a way, even Mrs. Lovett had met with her match. With a dexterity, that only long practice in dealing with the more desperate portion of human nature could have taught him, the tall man closed with her, and had the knife out of her hand in a moment. He at once threw it right through the window into Bell Yard, and then, holding Mrs. Lovett in his arms, he said- 
               "My dear madam, you only distress yourself for nothing; all resistance is perfectly useless. Either I must take you prisoner, or you me, and I decidedly incline to the former alternative." 
               The knife that had been thrown through the window was not without its object, for in a moment afterwards Mr. Crotchet made his appearance in the shop. 
               "All right, Crotchet," said he who had captured Mrs. Lovett: "first clap the bracelets on this lady." 
               "Here yer is," said Crotchet. "Lor, mum! had my eye on you month and months agone. How is you, mum, in your feelin's this here nice evening?-Eh, mum?" 
               "A knife-a knife! Oh, for a knife!" cried Mrs. Lovett. 
               "Ex-actly, mum," added Crotchet, as he with professional dexterity slipped the handcuffs on her wrists. "Would you like one with a hivory handle, mum? or would any thing more common do, mum?" 
               Mrs. Lovett fell to the floor, or rather she cast herself to it, and began voluntarily to beat her head against the boards. They quickly lifted her up; and then the tall stranger turned to the cook, who after leaping over the counter, had sat down upon a chair in a state of complete exhaustion, and he said- 
               "Do you know the way to Sir Richard's office, in Craven-street? He expects you there, I believe?" 
                
               "Yes, yes. But now that all is over I feel very ill." 
               "In that case, I will go with you, then. Crotchet, who have you got outside!" 
               "Only two of our pals, muster Green; but it's all right, if so be as you leaves the lady to us." 
               "Very well. The warrant is at Newgate, and the governor is expecting her instant arrival. You will get a coach at the corner of the yard, and be off with her at once." 
               "All's right," said Crotchet. "I knowed as she'd be nabbed, and I had one all ready, you sees." 
               "That was right, Crotchet. How amazingly quick everybody has left the shop. Why-why, what is all this?" 
               As the officer spoke, about half a dozen squares of glass in the shop window of the house were broken in, and a ringing shout from a dense mob that was rapidly collecting in the yard, came upon the cars of the officer. The two men whom Crotchet had mentioned, with difficulty pressed their way into the shop, and one of them cried- 
               "The people that were in the shop have spread the news all over the neighborhood, and the place is getting jammed up with a mob, every one of which is mad, I think, for talk of nothing but of the tearing of Mrs. Lovett to pieces. they are pouring in from Fleet-street and Carey-street by hundreds at a time." 
               Mrs. Lovett, upon hearing these words, turned ghastly pale, but she did not speak. the officers looked at each other with something like dismay, and then, before either of them could say another word, there arose a wild prolonged shout from without. 
               "Out with her-out with her! kill her! Tear her to bits, and hang her on the lamp-post in the middle of the Bell Yard! Out with her! Drag her out! Hang her! Hang her!" 
               "The coach you say is waiting, Crotchet?" said the officer, who had been intrusted by Sir Richard Blunt with the conduct of the whole business connected with Mrs. Lovett's capture. 
               "It were," said Crotchet, "and that coachman a'int the sort of fellow to move on till I tell him. I knows him." 
               "Very good, then we must make a dash for it, and get her away by main force. It must be done, let the risk and the consequences be what they may, and the sooner the better, too. Come on, madam." 
               "Death-death!" said Mrs. Lovett. "Kill me here, some of you, kill me at once; but do not let me be torn to pieces by a savage mob. Oh, God, they yell for my blood; Save me from them, and kill me here. A knife! oh, for a knife!" 
               "And a fork too, mum," said Crotchet, "in course, if you wants 'em. I tells you what it is, Mr. Green, that there mob is just savage, and we have about as much chance of getting her down to Fleet-street with her head on her shoulders, as all of us have of flying over the blessed house tops." 
               "We must. It is our duty, and if we fail, they must kill us which I don't think they will do. Come on." 
               Another loud roar from the infuriated people without, drowned whatever the officer might have said in reply to this appeal from Mrs. Lovett, and again arose the wild shouts of- 
               "Out with her!-Out with her!-Hang her!-Hang the murderess!-In the yard!-Out with her!" 
               "Forward!" cried Mr. Green. "To hesitate is only to make our situation ten times worse, Forward!" 
               "Hold a bit," cried Crotchet, "let me speak to the people; I know how to humor 'em. Only you see if I don't get her along. Come mum, step this a-ways if yer pleases. Open the door, Mr. Cook, and let me out first." 
                
               The cook opened the door, and before the mob could rush into the place, Crotchet stepped on to the threshold of the shop, and in a tremendous voice that made itself heard above all others, he cried- 
               "Hurrah! Hurrah!" 
               Nothing is easier than to throw a cry into a crowd, and to get it echoed to your heart' content; and so some couple of hundred voices now immediately cried-"Hurrah!" and when the vast volume of sound had died away, Crotchet, in such a voice that it must have been heard in Fleet-street quite plainly, said- 
               "My opinion is, that Mrs. Lovett ought to be hung outright, and at once, without any more bother about it." 
               "Hurrah!-Hang her!" shouted the mob. 
               "And," added Crotchet, "I propose the lamp-post at the top of Fleet Market, as a nice public sort of place to do the job in. She says she won't walk, but I have a coach in Fleet-street, and we will pop her into that, and so take her along quite snug." 
               "Yes, yes," cried the people, "bring her along; that will do." 
               "Oh, will it?" muttered Crotchet to himself, "what a precious set of ninnies you are. If I get her once in the coach, and she gets out again, except to step into the stone jug, may I he hanged myself." 
               "You will deliver me up to the mob," screamed Mrs. Lovett. "Mercy! Mercy! I shall be torn limb from limb. O, what a death! Are you men or fiends, that you will condemn me to it? Mercy!-Mercy!" 
               This sudden passion of Mrs. Lovett's was the very thing the officers would have desired, inasmuch as it materially helped to deceive the mob, and to prevent any idea upon the part of the infuriated people, that there was any collusion between the officers and Mrs. Lovett, for the purpose of getting her safely to prison. 
               "Let's get along with her," cried Crotchet. "I have her tight. She won't get away. Some of you get a good stout rope ready, and make a noose in it. We will hang her on the lamp-post at the top of the market. Bring her along. Make way a little. only a little.' 
               Mrs. Lovet shrieked as she saw the sea of angry faces before, behind, and on all sides of her. She thought that surely her ever calculated upon in her worst moments of depression, was about to be here. Her eyes were blood-shot-she bit her under lip through, and the blood poured from her mouth-she each moment, that she could get breath to do so, raised a fearful shriek, and the mob shouted and yelled, and swayed to and fro, and the links were tossed from hand to hand, flashing, and throwing around them thousands of bright sparks, and people rapidly joined the mob. 
               It took a quarter of an hour to reach the coach from the door of Mrs. Lovett's shop, a distance that in twenty or thirty steps any one might have traversed; and, oh! what a quarter of an hour of horrible suffering that was to the wretched woman, whose crimes had so infuriated the populace, that, with one voice, they called for her death. 
               The coach door was opened, and Crotchet pushed his prisoner in. Mr. Green, and the other officer, and the cook; followed her. 
               "I will go on the box," said Crotchet. 
               "Very well," said Green, "but be mindful of your own safety, Crotchet.' 
               "All's right. There ain't any more o' my sort in London, and I know I am rather a valuable pieced o' goods. Has anybody got the rope ready for the lady!" 
               "Here you are," said a man, "I have one." 
               "You get up behind then," said Crotchet, "for of course you know we shall soon want you.' 
               "Yes, I will. That's right! It's all right, friends. I am to get up behind with the rope. Here's the rope!" 
                
               "Three cheers for the rope!" cried somebody, and the cheers were given with deafening violence. 
               "Now," said Crotchet to the coachman, "are you as bold as brass, and as strong as an iron file?" 
               The coachman looked puzzled, but Mr. Crotchet pursued his queries. 
               "Will these 'osses, if they is frightened a bit, cut along quick?" 
               "Rather," said the coachman. "The blessed fact is, that they won't cut along unless you do frighten them a bit; and as for me being an old file and having lots o' brass, I doesn't consider as I'm a bit worser nor my neighbors." 
               "You is hignorant as a badger!" said Crocket. "Make yourself easy and give me the reins. The mobs o' people thinks as we is a going to hang the woman at the corner of Fleet Market, but if I lives another ten minutes, she will be in Newgate. There may be something of a scuffle, and if anything happens to you, or to the coach, or the 'osses, the country will pay handsomely, so now give me the reins. You may not like to whip through them, but I haven't the least objection.' 
               The coachman looked scared and nervous, but he gave up the reins and the whip to Crotchet, and then leaning back on the box, he waited with no small trepidation the result of the expected disturbance, while he had only Mr. Crotchet's word that the county would pay handsomely. 
               The short distance from the corner of Bell Yard to the end of Fleet Market was rapidly traversed, and when that interesting point was reached, the dense mass of people set up another shout, and began to surround the lamp-post that was there, and to fill up all the avenues. 
               "Get the rope up," said Crocket. 
               "Yes, yes, Hurrah! hurrah! Pull her out, and hang her!" 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXXII. 
               Mrs. Lovett's escape-The cook waits upon Sir Richard Blunt and hears news. 
               THE highly interesting process of getting the rope fixed upon the little projecting piece of iron, on which the lamplighter was wont to rest his ladder, had the effect that Crotchet expected, namely, to attract general attention; and then, taking advantage of the moment, he seized the whip and used it with such effect upon the horses, that terrified and half maddened, they set off with the coach at a tearing gallop. For a moment or two-and in that moment or two Mr. Crotchet with his prisoner got to the corner of the Old Bailey-the mob were so staggered by this unexpected elopement of the hackney-coach, that not a soul followed it. The idea that the horses had, of their own accord, started, being probably alarmed at the links, was the first that possessed the people, and many voices called out loudly- 
               "Pull 'em in-pull 'em in! Saw their heads off!" 
               But when they saw Mr. Crotchet fairly turn into the Old Bailey, the trick that had been played upon them became apparent; and one yell of indignation and rage burst from the multitude. 
               The pursuit was immediate; but Mr. Crotchet had too much the start of the mob, and long before the struggling infuriated people, impeding each other as they tore along, had reached the corner of the Old Bailey, Mrs. Lovett was in the lobby of the prison, and the officers safely with her. She looked like a corpse. The color of her face was that of soiled white wax. 
               The private office of Sir Richard, it will be recollected, was in Craven street, at the bottom of the Stand. Upon the route there, Mr. Crotchet and the cook held a long and very serious discourse about the proceedings of Mrs. Lovett. 
                
               Sir Richard was at home, and anxiously expecting them. "Thank God," he said, "two of the greatest malefactors the world ever saw are now in the hands of justice. 
               "Yes," said Crotchet, "they are cotched." 
               "You may depend all of you," added Sir Richard, "that your conduct and great skill and exertion in this affair shall by me be communicated to the Secretary of State, who will not leave you unrewarded. Pray wait for me in the outer room, I have some private business with this gentleman." 
               The officers were a little surprised to hear Sir Richard Blunt call Mrs. Lovett's cook "this gentleman," but they took no notice of the circumstance while in the presence of their principal, and in a few moments the magistrate was alone with the cook. from a cupboard in his room, then Sir Richard Blunt took wine and other refreshments, and laid them before the cook, saying- 
               "Refresh yourself, my friend; but for your own sake, as your fare has been but indifferent for some time, I beg you to be sparing." 
               "I will, sir. I owe you much-very much!" 
               "You are free now/' 
               "I am, sir." 
               "And yet you are very unhappy." 
               The cook started and changed color slightly. He filled for himself a glass of wine, and after drinking it he heaved a sigh as he said- 
               "I am, sir, an orphan, and was brought up an uncle with every expectation that he would be kind and liberal to me as I progressed in years; but he had taken his own course, and had made up his mind as to what I was to be, how I was to look, and what I was to say and do, without asking himself the question, if nature was good enough to coincide with him or not. The consequence was then, that directly he found me very different from what he to his displeasure, by committing the greatest crime that in his eyes I could commit; I fell in love. My uncle and I met very seldom, but he learned that I continued, despite his prohibition, to meet with the only being who ever awakened in my bosom a tender feeling; and so I was abandoned by my relative, and left penniless almost. I heard that an expedition was about to start to explore some rich islands in the Southern Sea, and I became one of the adventurers, much against the inclination of the gentle girl whom I loved. The principal object of the voyage failed entirely; but by pure accident I got possession of a string of pearls, of very great value indeed, which, provided I could get home in safety, would value in Europe quite a sufficient sum to enable us to live in comfort. But we were wrecked; and believing that I should not survive, I handed the pearls to a stronger comrade, and begged him to take to her whom I had loved, to tell her my fate, and bid her not weep for me, since I had died happy in the thought that I had achieved something for her; and so my friend and I parted. I was preserved and got on board a merchant vessel bound for England, where I arrived absolutely poor girl faithful to me, I felt that we might yet be happy, whether my comrade had lived to bring to her the pearls or not. I walked from Southampton to London, subsisting on the road as best I could. I reached London tolerably exhausted, and in anything but a good plight. I walked up the Strand; and as some of our happiest interview had taken place in the Temple Gardens, I could not resist turning aside for a moment to look at the familiar spot, when I saw her whom I loved-the young and beautiful girl whom I loved so fondly, leaning upon the arm of a man in a military undress; she was almost upon his breast, and he was actually supporting her with one of his arms round her waist. I did not speak to her, sir. The sight of such perfidy was enough for me. From that moment she fell from the height I had raised her to in my imagination, and nothing she could say, and nothing I could say, would raise her up again. With such a pang at my heart at the moment as I wonder did not kill me, I walked away, and left her to her own conclusions." 
               "Then-then, my young friend, you did the very reverse of what I should have done, for you should have gone up to her, and politely taken leave of her, so as to let her know, at all events, that you were aware of her perfidy. I really am surprised that you did not step forward and say, 'Oblige me, miss, with my pearls, if you no longer favor me with your affections!'" 
               "No, no. To tell the truth, I was too heart-broken at the time to care about anything in all the world; I had lost her who was to me the greatest jewel it had ever contained, and I cared for nothing else. I found myself tired, worn out, famishing, opposite to Mrs. Lovett's shop-window, and the steam of those abominable pies began to tempt me, so much that I went into the shop, and after some talk, I actually accepted the situation of cook to her, and there, but for you, I should have breathed my last." 
               "Not a doubt of it. And now, my young friend, you know that I am a police-magistrate, and I dare say you have heard a great deal about my sources of information, and the odd way in which I found out things when folks think that they keep them a profound secret. You have told me all your history, but you have thought proper, as you were, if you pleased, quite justified in doing, to withhold you name." 
               "I have done so, but I hardly know why. I will tell it to you, however, now." 
               "Hold, I know it! your name is Mark Ingestrie!" 
               "It is indeed. But how you came to know that, sir, is to me most mysterious." 
               "O, I know more than that. The name of the young lady who, you believe, played you such a trick, is Johanna Oakley." 
               Mark Ingestrie, for it was indeed no other, sprang to his feet, exclaiming- 
               "Are you man or devil, that you know what I have never breathed to you?" 
               "Don't be surprised, my young friend. I can tell you a little more than that even. The friend to whom you intrusted your string of pearls, was named Francis Thornhill; who went into the shop of Sweeney Todd, and was most foully murdered; and the String of Pearls got into the possession of that man, proving ultimately one of the means by which his frightful villainous crime came to light. His dog remained at Todd's door seeking for its master, to the great discomfiture of the murderer, who made every effort within his power for its destruction; in which, however, he did not succeed." 
               "And so I have wronged her after all. O, my Johanna, I am unworthy of you!" 
               "That," said Sir Richard, "is a subject entirely for the young lady's own consideration.-N. O. W." 
               Mark Ingestrie looked curiously in the face of Sir Richard Blunt, as with marked emphasis upon each letter he said, "N. O. W!" But he had not to wait for an explanation of what it meant. A door at the back of the room was flung open, and Johanna sprung forward with a cry of joy. In another moment she was in the arms of Mark Ingestrie, and Sir Richard Blunt had left the room. 
               Johanna Oakley and Mark Ingestrie for about half an hour forgot where they were, or that there was any one in the world but themselves. At the end of that period of time, though, Sir Richard Blunt gently walked into the room. 
               "Well," he said, "have you came to any understanding about that military man in Temple Gardens?" 
               Johanna sprang towards the magistrate, and placing her arms upon his breast, she kissed him on the cheek. 
                
               "Sir," she said, "you are our very dear friend, and I love you as I love my father." 
               "God bless you!" said Sir Richard. "You have, by those few words, more than repaid me for all that I have done. Are you happy?" 
               "Very, very happy." 
               "So very happy, sir," said Ingestrie, as his eyes glistened through tears of joy, "that I can hardly believe in its reality." 
               "And yet you are both so very poor." 
               "Ah, sir, what is poverty when we shall be together?" 
               "We will face that foe, Mark," said Johanna, with a smile, "and he shall not extort a tear from us." 
               "Well," said Sir Richard, as he opened his desk, "since you are not to be knocked down by poverty, what say you to riches? Do you know these, Mr. Ingestrie?" 
               "Why, that is my String of Pearls." 
               "Yes, I took this from Todd's escritoire myself, and they are yours and Johanna's. Will you permit me always to call you Johanna?" 
               "O, yes-yes. Do so. All who love me call me Johanna." 
               "Very well. This String of Pearls, I have ascertained, is worth a sufficient sum to place you both very far above all the primary exigencies of life. It will be necessary to produce them at the trial of Sweeney Todd, but after that event they will be handed to you to do what you please with them, when you can realize them at once, and be happy enough with the proceeds." 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXXIII. 
               The Criminals at Newgate. 
               THE state of mind that Todd was in after his arrest, was one that such a man, with such strong passions as he had, was exceedingly unlikely to come to. It is difficult to describe it, but if we say that he was mentally stunned, We shall be as near the mark as language will permit us to be. 
               Mrs. Lovett had suffered no less from the horrors of her imprisonment, that her partner in crime. She had determined to do all in her power to preserve her life, and if she failed to do so, she had the means in her own hand to save the officers of justice the trouble of making a public exhibition of her on the scaffold. She had volunteered to turn State's evidence, and had been refused. She dreaded a public execution, and determined to do Todd all the injury she could; she sent for the chaplain, and made a full confession. It was nearly evening when she finished. The door of the cell was closed, and the last rays of the turnkey's candle disappeared. Mrs. Lovett was alone again in her dreary cell. 
               The darkness was now very intense, indeed: for during the few minutes that she had been conversing with the chaplain, the twilight had almost faded away, dropping quite into night, so that not an object was visible in the cell. She heard the turnkey's footsteps die away in the distance, and then indeed she felt truly alone. 
               "And I shall not see the sunlight of another day," she said. "My pilgrimage is over." 
               She pronounced these words with shudder, for even she could not for a moment feel quite at ease. She held in her hands the means of death, and yet she hesitated-not that she had the least intention of foregoing her fixed resolve; but feeling that at any moment she had it in her power now to carry it out, she lingered there upon the shores of life. 
               For the very first time in all her wicked life something like a perception of a future state had crossed her mind; and each minute how fearfully to her the possibility, and then the probability, that there was another world than this, began now to grow upon her. 
               That thought was more full of agony than the appearance of the specters had been to her-those spectres which were only called into existence by her own consciousness of overpowering guilt and deep iniquity. 
               "I am going now," she said. "I am going. World that I hate, and all upon thee, farewell!" 
               She broke the tin case containing the poison, and applying one of the broken ends to her lips, she swallowed two drops of the deadly liquid, and fell dead upon the floor of her cell. 
                
               No pen can describe the feelings of Sweeney Todd, as day after day passed away in his lonely cell. It was in vain that he attempted to take his own life-ready hands were on the alert to prevent him. His trial was conducted by the chief justice of the realm-he was found guilty of murder, and sentenced to be hung. At the close of the trial he requested to speak to Sir Richard Blunt privately, and no sooner had that magistrate approached than, with the rapidity of thought, Todd drew a small table knife from the breast of his apparel, and made a stab at Sir Richard's neck with it; but the magistrate had had by far too long experience with such men as Todd to be taken at unawares, and he dropped to the floor of the court before the point of the knife reached him. The Governor of Newgate sprung upon Todd, and disarmed him in a moment. 
               "Curses on ye all!" he cried; and then he burst into a torrent of such frightful invectives, that every body shrunk aghast from it, and it is quite impossible that we should transfer it to our pages. The officer rushed upon him, and by main force dragged him from the dock and the court into the dark passages leading to Newgate. 
               "Why is this?" he said. "Why an I placed here? This cell is darker than the one I before occupied." 
               "It's quite light enough for you," growled a turnkey. 
               "Yes," added one of the officers who had been in court. "Folks who are keen and bright enough to pick up knives, and nobody see 'em mustn't have too much light in their cell. Oh, won't it be a mercy when you are settled next Monday morning." 
               "The fetters hurt me," said Todd. 
               "Oh, they are too light," said the officer; "and for your satisfaction, I have to tell you that the Governor has ordered you another pair." 
               At this moment a couple of blacksmiths came into the cell, carrying with them the heaviest set of irons in the whole prison, which the Governor had determined Sweeney Todd should be accommodated with. Without a word they proceeded to knock off the fetters that he wore. 
               "So you are not contented," said Todd, "to cage me up as though I were some wild animal, but you must load me with irons?" 
               "And a good job too." 
               "And you think to hang me?" 
               "Rather!" 
               "Then thus I disappoint you, and be my own executioner!' 
               As he spoke he snatched up one of the smith's hammers, and made a blow at his own forehead with it, which if it had taken effect, would unquestionably have fractured his skill, and killed him instantly; but one of the officers just managed to strike his arm at the moment and confuse his aim, so that although he did strike himself, it was not with any thing like sufficient force to do himself any hurt. The hammer was wrested from him in a moment and he was thrown to the floor of the cell, the heavy irons placed upon him, and Todd was left alone. 
                
               "All the night to myself," he muttered; "he will not visit this cell until the morning. A long-long night; many hours of solitude. Well, I may chance to improve them. It was well in that scuffle for the hammer, when they threw me down, that I contrived to grasp a handful of tools from the smith's basket, and hid them among my clothing. Let me see what I have-ay, let me see, or rather feel, for by this light, or rather by this darkness, I can only judge of them by the feel." 
               The tools Sweeney Todd had been clever enough to abstract from the smiths' basket, consisted of two files and a chisel. He ran his fingers over them with a feeling of satisfaction. 
               "Now," he muttered, "if the feeling to die were upon me, here are the means; but it has passed away, and even with these small weapons, and in cell of Newgate, I do not feel quite so helpless as I was. What a pleasure would it be for me to hold that girl by the throat, who so hoodwinked me as to impose herself upon me for a boy, and to see and hear her choking. How I should like to see the blood of Sir Richard Blunt weltering forth, while his color faded, and he expiring gradually!" 
               He raved and cursed frightfully, until he was too much exhausted to continue such a course, and then he sat upon the floor and with one of the files he began working away assiduously at the iron, in order to free himself from those clogs to his movements. 
               As he worked he heard the prison clock strike ten. 
               "Ten," he said. Ten already! Of a truth I did not think it was so late! I must be quick. Others have escaped from Newgate, and why should not I? The attempt will and shall be made; who knows but that it may be successful? A man may do much when he is resolved that he will do all he wishes or die." 
               Todd filed away t the chains. 
               He finally succeeded in removing the fetters; save one on the left ankle. "I shall be free! Did they think to hold me with those chains? Ha! ha! No. It may be, that there is a dark spirit of evil that aids men, such as I am: and if it be so, I will consent to he wholly his, if-" 
               Todd started, for a noise which had just before come upon his ears, now attracted him. It was plainer though than before; and at the moment he thought that it must be in his cell. A cry of terror rose to his lips, but he smothered it in the utterance, and bent again all his faculties to listen. 
               Suddenly a stone, which was about a foot square, shook so, tha Todd withdrew from it, thinking that it would come out of its place altogether: and as it was evidently the object of the prisoner at the other side to push it through into Todd's cell, he thought it better to stand on one side and let it come. Suddenly with crash, it fell through, and then Todd spoke, for the first time, to the prisoner. 
               "Who's there? Who are you?" cried Todd. 
               "The deuce!" said a voice from the adjoining cell. "Sold at last, after all my trouble. Confound you, why didn't speak before, and save me the last hour's work?" 
               "What do you mean?" cried Todd. "I am a desperate man. Do not tamper with me. Do you belong to the prison, or do you not?" 
               "I belong to the prison? I should think not. Don't you?" 
               "O, no-no-no-no." 
               "Why, you don't mean to say that you are a prisoner?" 
               "I am, indeed, and condemned to die." 
               "All's right then; Bravo! This is capital. I thought I was in the end cell, do you know, and that by working through the wall by the assistance of Providence always-Bah! I can't get out of the old trade. I meant to say, that I thought I was working through a wall that would have taken me into one of the corridors of Newgate, and then there would have been a chance of getting off, you know." 
                
               "I do not know, and did not know," said Todd, "but if there be really any chance of escape, I am a desperate man, and will risk any thing for it. Only say that you will help me." 
               "Help you? Of course I will. Do you think I am in love with these cold walls? No, I will get a light in a moment, and we can then have a look at each other. Are you in fetters?" 
               "I was, but I have a file, and have succeeded in freeing myself from them completely. Are you?" 
               "Yes, but I have muffled them with some pieces of my clothing that I have torn up for the purpose, and please the Lord they will make no noise. You see, a religious lady left me some tracts, and as I told her they did not allow light here, she was kind enough to smuggle me in some phosphorus matches, in case in the night I should wish to read." 
               "Very kind of her," said Todd. 
               "O, very. Let us praise the-Bother, I shall never get out of the habit of chanting, I do believe." 
               In a moment, now a faint blue light illumined the cell adjoining to Todd's and as the religious lady had been kind enough to bring some little wax ends of candles, the prisoner lit one, and placing it upon the ledge left by the displaced brick in the wall, he put his face close to it, and looked at Todd. Todd did the same thing and looked at him. 
               "Humph," said the prisoner, "they are not going to hang you for your beauty, whoever you are, my friend." 
               "Nor you," said Todd, who was a very little stung by this cool remark, "for I must say a more villainous looking countenance than yours I never saw in all my life." 
               "Then you certainly never looked in a glass." 
               "Hark you, my friend," said Todd. "if we are to aid each other in getting our of Newgate, it will not be any railing at each other through a square hole in the wall of our cells. We have better leave all remarks about our looks to other folks, and at once set to work about what is much more important, namely, breaking our way our of this most detestable of all places." 
               The two murderers labored hard for a couple of hours, and before daylight they were free from Newgate, and, although they were hotly pursued, succeeded in reaching Caen wood. Todd had no money, while Lupin possessed a few pounds, the which he was unwilling to share; and the barber, with all the cunning which he possessed in his better days, succeeded in persuading Lupin that he had two thousand pounds buried in a place to which he would direct him. They had travelled a few hours when Todd, who begun to grow weary, made up his mind that the sooner he got rid of his companion, and possessed himself of his money the better. Looking up he said- 
               "You see that cluster of bushes?" 
               "Yes, oh yes." 
               "Well, the money lies hidden right in there, and you cannot miss it if you scramble in." 
               "Lend me your stick to clear away the brambles and the nettles, and I will creep in." 
               "My dear friend, I shall fall down if I lend you the stick. There is no difficulty in getting in. Don't you see there is a gap that you have only to push through, and there you are?" 
               "Well, well," said Lupin, "that's enough; I will get through. Come on, let us secure the gold." 
               Lupin stooped to push his way through the gap in the hedge, for the bushes grew so close together just there, that they resembled an enclosure carefully planted on purpose. Then Todd took the heavy stick that had been cut from a sycamore tree in both hands, and swinging it in the air, he brought it down with a stunning crack on the back of Lupin's head, just at the juncture of the neck. 
                
               "Dead!" said Todd, as he stood gaunt and erect before his victim, with the stick stretched out in his hand. "Dead-quite dead. Rest you there, Mr. Lupin. I have only saved the hangman, after all, the trouble of taking you life, for I can feel well assured that such would have been your end." 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXXVI. 
               Conclusion. 
               WE cannot follow Todd through the many hair-breadth escapes which he had. He visited his old haunts in Fleet-street, where he murdered two of Sir Richard Blunt's men, who had been left in charge of the house. 
               He was, however, tracked, and hotly pursued by the Bow-street officers, but he succeeded in reaching the woods, where he remained until hunger drove him out upon the high road. 
               He had not gone far when he heard the sound of wheels behind him, and he got over a hedge and hid behind it until he could see what sort of a vehicle it was that approached. It turned our to be a cart driven by a couple of countrymen, who were talking upon their won affairs in rather loud tones; as they came on, Todd listened intently, and was satisfied that his supposed escape into that neighborhood was not the subject of their discourse. 
               "Hilloa!" cried Todd, as he came out into the middle of the road and confronted the cart with the two men in it. "Hilloa! which way are you going?" 
               "We will soon let you know," said the man who had not been driving, knitting his brows. "No doubt, you thought you had nailed us nicely, my fine fellow." 
               "Nailed you?" 
               "Yes. You need not put on such an innocent look, I can tell you. We are pretty good judges in these matters, and it's quite sufficient for me to tell you that we know you for an exciseman." 
               "A what?" 
               "An exciseman. You know well you have been on the look-out for us for the last week; so it's of no use denying it. You thought you nabbed us, when you got into our cart." 
               Todd lowered his pistol. 
               "This is a foolish enough mistake," he said; "I am no more an exciseman than I am a commander-in-chief of the forces. I want to get on board some vessel. I don't care what, so that it is bound to some continental port. My object, I tell you, is to get away, and that is all." 
               The two men now whispered together for a few moments, and then agreed to convey him in a smuggling craft called the "Lively William," to the port of Havre in France. 
               "Now," said one of them to Todd, "as you have no objection to go on board at once, we will put you there." 
               "Objection?" cried Todd. "My objection is to remain on land. "I beg that you will let me feel that I am on the deck of your vessel as quickly as possible." 
               Todd almost thought that he was saved when he felt himself fairly upon the deck of the Lively William. It seemed to him such a miracle to get so far, that his faith in completely getting the better of his enemies increased wonderfully. The little craft was soon on her way. 
               "This is a state cabin," said the captain. "You can order whatever you like to eat and drink, provided you don't think of any thing but boiled beef, biscuits, and brandy." 
                
               The Lively William was going on just then with a flowing sheet, so that she was carrying a tolerably even keel, and Todd was able to get up and reach his berth; but at the moment when he laid hold of the side of it to clamber in, the ship was tacked, and away went Todd to the opposite side of the state-cabin with a rug in his grasp that did duty as a counterpane in the berth. 
               "This will kill me," he groaned. "Oh, this will kill me. But yet-yet I I am escaping, and that is something. There will be a storm, but all ships are not lost that encounter storms." 
               Todd made up his mind to remain where he was, jammed up against the cabin partition, until the ship should right itself sufficiently for him to make another effort to reach his berth. 
               After a few minutes he thought he would make the attempt. 
               "Now," he said. "Now, surely, I can do it. I will try. How the wind howls, to be sure, and how the waves dash against the ship's sides, as though they would stave in her timbers; but all is well, no doubt. I will try again." 
               Very cautiously now Todd crept to his berth, and this time the wind and the waves were kind enough only to move the ship so that he knocked his head right and left a little, and managed then ship so that he knocked his head right and left a little, and managed then to scramble on to the little inconvenient shelf, with its damp mattress that served for a bed. A cold clammy dew burst out upon his face-all strength fled from his limbs, and with a deep groan, Todd began to feel the real horror of sea-sickness. 
               Nothing can be like sea-sickness but death, and nothing can be like death but sea-sickness. Todd had never suffered from that calamity before; and now that it came upon him, in all its aggravated horrors, he could not believe that it was a mere passing indisposition, but he concluded that he mist have been poisoned by the captain of the ship, and that his last hour had come; he was so bad that, in his want of experience of what sea sickness really was, he thought that every moment would be his last; he heard some one coming down into the cabin, and one of the crew rolled rather than walked into it. Down into the cabin, and one of the crew rolled rather than walked into it. 
               "Help!" said Todd. "Oh, help!" 
               "You go to the d-l!" said the man. "The captain is washed overboard, and we are all going to the bottom, so I am one who likes to take a little spirits with him to qualify the water that one may be obliged to swallow. That's it. Steady, craft, steady." 
               "No!" cried Todd, finding that positive fright lent him strength, "You do not mean that?" 
               It was truly a dreadful night, and such as fully merited the worst apprehensions of the sailor, who had spoken so coolly to Todd of his coming fate. 
               There was but one chance for those on board of the vessel, and that was that the wind might abate sufficiently to enable some boats to put off from the Sussex coast, provided they happened to be off a part of it where accommodation was to be had, and rescue those upon the wreck. The lights that at intervals were visible, rather favored the supposition that it was a populous part of the coast that ill-starred struggling ship was driving fast upon. 
               Todd, however, did not know of that slender hope, and he gave himself up to despair. 
               One of the seamen cried out in a loud voice- 
               "Save themselves who can! We shall be on shore, now, in less than five minutes!" 
               The keel of the Lively William grated on the rocks-one lurch, and Sweeney Todd, together with the crew of the vessel, were rolling in the surges. 
                
               The scene now upon the beach at Brighton, to which place Colonel Jefferey had conveyed those whom Todd would murder if he could reach, was one of the most exciting that can well be imagined. No one who has not stood upon a beach under such circumstances, and seen a brave ship battling with the waters, can have any real idea of it. It is so hopeless a thing to stand upon the shore, and listen to the wind roaring in its fury, and to see the waves dashing in mad gyrations hither and thither, while a few frail and creaking timbers only keep some mortals from sinking into the sea, that no wonder persons with kindly sympathies and gentle feelings towards human nature, such as Colonel Jefferey and Mark Ingestrie had, should suffer acutely to see other so suffer. 
               If there had been any likelihood of a boat reaching the ill-fated ship, Ingestrie would have been the first to propose such a measure, and the first, with hand and heart, to carry it out; but there was no such likelihood. Our friend had seen too much service afloat, and was by far too good a sailor to suppose, for an instant, that any boat could live for a cable's length from the shore in such a sea as that. 
               "Oh, this is, indeed terrible," said Colonel Jeffery, "it is too horrible." 
               "It is, indeed!" cried Ingestrie. "There is but one chance now of doing any good, and that is in case any poor fellow should be washed on shore through the surf with any sparks of life in him. Hilloa, my men!-get out your tackle, and let us look after the survivors. Some one may try to fight through it yet." 
               The sailors and boatmen upon the beach were charmed with the idea that they might be able to do some good in this way; and as they soon found that Ingestrie knew perfectly well what he was about, they listened to his orders, in the course they should take, and obeyed them with alacrity and skill. 
               "I see a human being struggling with the foam, and from his actions he is no swimmer. I cannot stand here and see him die, while there is a chance of saving him. Hark you! Don't wait for me to sing out, but use your own eyes, and begin to pull in the moment you see me close with him. The dawn is coming rapidly, and you will see better each moment. Now, I'm off." 
               "For the love of heaven be careful!" cried the Colonel. 
               Ingestire smiled, and then dashed into the roaring, bubbling surf of the sea, with the rope round his waist. 
               Colonel Jefferey distinctly saw Ingestrie reach the body, at length, and the sailor who had hold of the rope, likewise saw him, and he sung out- 
               "Now, pull away; but easy, my lads-a steady pull, and no jerking, or you will hinder him instead of helping. That's it-easy now, easy." 
               It was clear that Ingestrie had got hold of the floating object, whatever it was, and that, as he pulled him into the shore, he brought it with him. When he reached the edge of the surf again, a quick pull brought him at once through it, and a couple of the sailors, dashing into the waters, got a hold of him, and drew him right up on to the beach between them. 
               Half a dozen more brought to the share the body of a man, tied to a plank of wood. 
               Poor Mark was nearly exhausted. He was just able only to smile faintly, in answer to the Colonel's anxious inquiries. 
               "At all events, Mark," said Johanna, "there is one human being who, through life, let his position and prospects be what they may, must look upon you as his friend and preserver." 
               The Colonel entered the house, and when he and all his friends had got into the drawing-room, they sent for a servant to inquire how the poor wrecked man was getting on, and, after a little time, one of the domestics of the house came to say that he was up, and sitting, dressed, in the front kitchen, and would be happy to see and to thank those who had saved him from death in the raging sea. 
               "Shall we have him up here?" said the Colonel. 
               "Yes, if you please," said Ingestrie; "and, I daresay, a glass of wine won't hurt him, while he tells us the name of his ship, poor fellow, and who and what he is." 
               Orders were given that the shipwrecked man should be shown to the drawing-room, for they were all curious to know to what ship the had belonged, and how many had fallen victims to the frightful gale that had made the vessel such a complete wreck. 
               "He is coming, poor fellow," said the Colonel. "I hear his footsteps on the stairs, He comes slowly. No doubt he is weak yet." 
               "Poor fellow," sighed Johanna. "Have the wine ready to give him at once, mother. It will put some heart into him. What must be his feelings toward you, Mark?" 
               "Come now," said Ingestrie; "don't plague him, any of you, about his being saved by me, and all that sort of thing. Just say nothing about it. Sailors are no great orators, at the best of times, and if he begins to make a speech about his gratitude, you may depend he will never get to the end of it." 
               The door of the drawing-room opened, and all eyes were eagerly bent in that direction. A tall gigantic figure marched a few paces into the room. 
               "Todd!" shouted Tobias. "It is Todd!" 
               It was Sweeney Todd! With one glance round the room, he recognized an enemy in every face. With a perfect yell of fear and rage, he turned, and dashed down the staircase. The servant who had conducted him up to the drawing-room, and whom he met on his way, he knocked down with one blow, and in another moment he was in the street. The Colonel's horse was close to the door. Todd felled the man who held it by a blow on the top of his head, that took him so suddenly, he could not guard unearthly kind of shout, and set off at a gallop. 
               So sudden-so totally unexpected, and so appalling had been the presence of Todd in the drawing-room, that if a specter had appeared among the people there assembled, and they had no possible means of escaping from the belief that it was a spectre, they could not have been more confounded than they were upon this occasion. 
               Poor Tobias, after uttering the exclamation that we have recorded, fell that upon the floor. Johanna, shrieking, clung to Ingestrie. 
               "By heaven, he is off!" cried the Colonel, as he heard the clatter of the horse's feet. 
               "No!" shouted Ingestrie, "it cannot be! Johanna, unhand me, I implore you. Do you wish the murderer to be lost sight of? Come on, Colonel-you and I must engage in this pursuit. God of heaven! the idea of me saving Todd from the waves!" 
               The Colonel and Ingestrie seized their hats, and rushed down the stairs, tumbling over the servant in the hall. The next object they came across was the groom who had charge of the horse. They found him sitting on the pavement, looking as confused as possible. 
               "Which way has he gone?" cried the Colonel. 
               "The-the man. Round that corner, and Hector has gone after him, like mad, sir. Oh, dear!" 
               "Hector? Then he will be taken, for I will back Hector to hang upon him like grim death. Come with me to the nearest stable, Ingestrie, and let us get horses! Come-come!" 
               In the course of seven or eight minutes at the outside, they were both mounted, and as there were plenty of people who could tell them in which direction Todd had gone, they were soon upon his track. 
               It was no small aggravation to Colonel Jefferey to be pursuing his own horse, while he himself was mounted upon a back that was by no means equal to it. Skill, however, will get more work out of an indifferent steed than absolute ignorance will achieve from a first rate one, so that after getting to the top of a rising ground about three miles out of Brighton, our friends saw Todd not three-quarters of a mile in advance, coasting a little water course to find a safe place to cross at. Notwithstanding the distance was great, the Colonel knew his own horse in a moment. 
               "Come on, Ingestrie," he said. 
               They had let their horses come rather easy up the ascent, for the Colonel was too good a horseman to break down his steed. To keep Todd in sight was everything now, for in that case they felt certain that they must eventually have him. They saw him shade his face with his hands, and take a long took and then by the sudden start that he gave, which caused the horse to plunge in alarm, they know that he had seen them, and from that moment he would strain every nerve to escape. 
               The slight pause that Todd had made in order to look back and see if he were pursued or not, had given his foes the advantage of about one hundred yards, for they had pushed during that pause with renewed vigor, but now, bending low in the saddle, it was evident that he was doing his best to urge the Colonel's horse onwards, and it went like the wind. 
               A stern chase is a long chase, but an escape even at considerable speed is a weary affair, with a foe directly behind; and the Colonel calculated that allowing Todd all the difference in speed between the horses, it would be yet a long distance before he could throw them back so far that they would not be in a position to take advantage of any accident that might occur to him. 
               "Cool and easy, Ingestrie," he said; "it's a question of time, now. The longer we keep our horses on their legs, the better for us. Don't urge your horse too much." 
               Todd had now reached a very wild and romantic part of the road, and had got about half way through this place, when, from the other end of it, there came a party of five horsemen. 
               One man rode at the head of the party upon a black horse, which had evidently gone far that day. Todd and this man met face to face, and they simultaneously pronounced each other's names. 
               "Sir Richard Blunt!" shrieked Todd. 
               "Sweeney Todd!" said the magistrate. 
               "Stop him!" shouted Ingestrie, as he and the Colonel just got a sight of the horsemen beyond Todd. "Stop him!" 
               With a yell, like that which might be supposed to come from a fiend, Todd swerved from the grasp of Sir Richard Blunt, who made a dart at his throat, and then drawing up his knees, he gave his horse the rein, and darting past Sir Richard, he dashed right into the midst of the party of officers, who were behind, and fairly broke his way through them. 
               "Not yet-not yet!" he shouted. "Ha! ha! not yet!" 
               "Fire!" cried Sir Richard Blunt. 
               The sharp report of four holster-pistols sounded in the narrow road-way. Todd fell from his horse, and terrified by the shots, the steed went off without him at a mad gallop. 
               Twice Todd rolled over, and grasped handfuls of chalk and dust from the road; and then he lay profoundly still. In an instant, Sir Richard Blunt dismounted; and then Colonel Jeffrey and Mark Ingestrie rode up to the spot. 
               "Is he dead?" said Ingestrie. 
               "No," said Todd, opening his eyes. "He still lives to curse you all? I--" 
                
               It was evident he wished to say more; but he was bleeding internally, and he began to struggle with the volumes of blood that rose to his throat. With a horrible shriek, he rolled over on his face, and then, after one sharp convulsion of his limbs, he lay perfectly still. 
               One of the officers turned him round again. One glance at the face was sufficient. The guilty spirit of Sweeney Todd had fled at last to its account. 
               We have little to say in conclusion, now that the chief actor in the fearful Domestic Drama it has been our fate to record, is no more. 
               Sir Richard Blunt lived long to enjoy the respect and the admiration of all who knew him, and died full of years and honors. 
               The sunshine of the existence of Johanna and Mark was perfectly unclouded, and in time Tobias was married to her whom he loved so well; and as he got older and more used to the world, that timidity of disposition that Todd, by his cruelties had induced, entirely left him. 
               The mad house at Peckham was completely pulled down, and in well at the back of it was found the victim of Fogg's villany. It was by his own hand Fogg really died. 
               Often, as Johanna would sit on a winter's evening, with her children climbing on her knee, she would, with, a faltering voice, tell them what their dear father had suffered to procure for her and for them THE STRING OF PEARLS. 
             
            THE END.
