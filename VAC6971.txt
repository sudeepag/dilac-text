CHAPTER IL
THE CHASE.

It was October, 177 .. A heavy gale was
blowing from the northward. Two vessels-
one was a ship, the other a rakish fore-topsail
schooner, both armed-were standing off the
coast, leaving the Capes of the Delaware. Both
were under reefed sails. Tue ship contained
Benjamin Franklin, then boundon his mission
t Fran ;e -the schooner was the gallant little
Wasp to which Barney had been transferred
from the Hornet. It was singular that his first
experieiee in armed vessels was in these sting-
inz 1irds. as Paddy called the bees.
The Wasp convoyed Franklin's ship until
slei nas well beyond the line of cruisers
w hieh infested our coast at that time, and then
her Captain, Charley Alexander, put about to
return to the Delaware.
It was a clear morning when they re-sight-
ed Cage lenlopen,and at the same time made
out seven 'r sail lay ng in the roads on that side
of th-'  i.
"Oiita kind of craft do you think they are,

i   'is perched on the foretopsail yard,

" T    heavy for us--I'll stand off. and then
try th+ ('ape May channel," said the captain.
The breeze was pretty fresh, and hauling
more to the eastward now. But the gallant
little Wasp staggered along under a whole
topsail, mainsail, foresiil and jib, and soon
was up abreast of tie Cape May channel.
11cr head was now laid for the entrance of the
bay.
But she was not to slip in without notice, or
an attempt being made to bring her to. Tne
British vessels bad evidently, from her rake
and rig, discovered her character, and were
under a press of canvas standing across to cut
her off.
'She must bear the topgallant sail," mut-
tered the captain, as he saw that his clanc to
slip by the enemy's cruisers was slim
SShe'll stand it, and the squ-resail, too,
sir," said Barney-" the wind is well on our
quartr'r
The aiditionui sail was added, and with the
bows fairly huied in foam, the little schooner

stood bravely on her course. The British
ships, covered from the deck almost to their
trucks with canvas, were coming up. After
about two hours run, the leading vessel luffed
up, and a cloud oi smoke was seen to puff out
from her bow. Then the spray from a shot,
as it struck the water nearly a quarter of a
mile short of the schooner, rose in the air.
"Too weak winded," muttered Barney.
Then turning to the captain of the Wasp, he
said : "If you please, sir, I think our Long
Tom could measure the distance a little better
than that."
"Try it, Mr Barney, if you like," said the
captain.
"Thank you, sir," replied the youthful offi-
cer, "I owe the beef-eating rascals a grudge."
Carefully sighting the gun, which threw a
thirty-two pound shot, Barney applied the
match. Although the leading ship was full
two miles off, the effect of Barney's shot was
to knock her foreyard in two close to the
slings, and to deorive her of the use of both
the foresail and foretopsail for a time.
"Splendid, Mr. Barney, splendid! 'cried the
captain, in delight
"Shall I give her another, just by way of
compliment, sir:?"
"No, sir-not until we get further up the
bay. Every shot we fire will deaden our
headway-they are too heavy for us, and I
see there is a brig larger than us standing out
too. If the wind should die away, their boats,
with so many men, might give us a deal of
trouble."
Toe three British vessels, new finding itim-
possible to cut off the schooner before she
would place a middle-ground between them
ove: which they could not pass, for they were
provided with tory pilots, now stood up the
ilInlopen channel, pressing every stitch, of
canvas which they could set, determined to
overhaul her before she could reach a point of
the river protected by the American batteries.
But a stern chase is ever a long one. The
schooner had a little the advantage in distance,
but they had greatly the advantage in canvas,
for all three carried studding-sails, and the
schooner had none On-on dashed the Wasp,
like a deer before the hounds, still keeping
just out of gun shot until nearly night. Then,
as the breeze began to die away, the enemy
began to gain.
"It would be accursed luck if we were
taken at last," muttered the captain.

CHAPTER IV.

THE  BAFFLED  SUITOR.

There was a jolly party, on the second
evening after Barney had received his commis-
sion, at the sign of the "Spread Eagle," on
Market street, Philadelphia Reeves, the bur-
ly landlord, assisted by his son Clem, had
their hands full to attend to the numerous
calls made for Jamaica rum slings and Hol-
land schnapps, the two most fashionable bev-
erages in those days.
In the large, old-fashioned parlor, some fif-
teen or twenty perons, mostly officers in our
young navy, were gathered, and many a patri-
otic toast was given, many a song sung not at
all complimentary to King George or his loyal
subjects. Young Barney was the hero of
the evening, not only in consequence of his
recent good conduct, but also because he was
"wetting his commission," or, in other words,
giving tae entertainment.
While these light-hearted and gallant gen-
tlemen are enjoying themselves, reader, we
will avail ourselves of a mantle of invisibility,
and visit another scene which was occurring
only a half square or so distant from the tavern.
A very lovely young lady was sitting in a
handsomely-furntshed room-a parlor, appa-
rently. She was rather above the middle
height-her figure noble and full, her features
classically regular. Her complexion, though
clear as the thin rind of a pomegranate, was
of a brunettish hue, the rich blood often mant-
ling up to her very brow at the slightest ex-
citement. Her eyes were large and dark, as
if they had been condensed from a night-cloud,
with a tiny diamond of blazing light put in
the centre of each. These were fringed by
long ebon lashes, which hid that light if they
were but cast down. At the time which I
take for her introduction, she was sitting calm-
ly on a chair by a centre.table, one of her
hands toying with one of the glossy ringlets
which fell upon her white shoulders, the other
resting on marble less white than it was. A
look of cool contempt was expressed in her
face, which well became her haughty, queenly
appearance, as she gazed upon the other occu-
pant of the room.
He was a young man, very richly dressed
in the extreme of the then prevailing fashion.
But be bore the marks of dissipation, and his
face, though it would have been called hand-
some by some, had not an expression which
would impress a stranger. His figure was
elegant, but God had written villain on his
brow!t

He was striding to and fro in the room,
his face red and convulsed with passion, his
hands clenched, and his form quivering with
rage.
At last he paused before the lady, and, in a
voice low and husky, said, as he bent his.
gleaming eyes upon her:
"So, Miss Cora Bedford, you refuse my
hand-refuse it with scorn and contempt?"
"I do, Mr. Elliott 1" replied the lady, neither
blanching before his angry look, nor avoiding
the glance of his almost bloodshot eyes.
"Am I not wealthy ?" he continued.
"The world thinks you are," she replied,
with indifference.
"Am I not young; as good-looking as any
of your admirers?"
"You think so!" she responded, in the same
tone.
"Is not my family, am not I, respectable?
Stand we not at the topmost round of aristo-
cracy?"
"No!" responded the beautiful girl-" no!
not of the American aristocracy ! Your father
is a detestable tory, and you are a contempti-
ble puppy !"
As she spoke she rose, her queenly form
towering, and her face flushing with indig-
nation.
"Were you not a woman !" he muttered,
between his grating teeth.
"Were I a man, I'd scourge you from my
presence, you dastardly coward !" she said.
" As it is, Mr. Elliott, all that I can say is,
that the atmosphere in this apartment would
be much more agreeable to me if it was re-
lieved from the pollution of your presence. I
hope you will understand that hint, sir, and
not oblige me to ring for a servant to expel
you !"
"By the God who made me, you shall
suffer for this, proud girl !" he muttered
"Swear by the devil ; God never had any-
thing to do with such a wretch as you are!"
was her scornful reply.
"You shall sue on your bended knees for a
favor from me yet!" he cried. "From this
hour on, Cora Bedford, I devote myself to
your ruin 1"
"I defy 'on, you pitiful reptile-and mark
me ! the next time you dare to address me,
I'll make my father's negro servant scourge
you from the door, or horsewhip S ou in the
street, if there you speak to me!"
"You will?"

"Then hear my threat, Miss Bedford, since
threats are the order of the day-and I will
keep mine. I will kiss you the first time I'
meet you in public !"
" Make your will before you try' it !" re-
sponded the spirited girl, opening the door
and pointing to it.

Barney had just finished a rousing sea song,
when an addition was made to the numbers in
the room by the entrance of several young

eers were seated in a circle, and, although they
seemed by their actions to have already taken
aboard a pretty heavy cargo, called for a bowl
of punch.   .
The officers evidently considered this as
rather an intrusion, but, as they were in the
public parlor, and not in private room, made
no remark
The punch was brought by the attentive
landlord, and the gasses of the new-eomurs
were filled.

"What was the bet. Tom ?" asked another ;

of an insult to he premeditatedly offered to a
respectable lady.
"The man who would make such a bet is a
scoundrel, and the fellow who would take it is
a fool !" he cried. "The first ought to win a
broken head, and the second to be ducked in
a horse-pond !"
"Do you mean me, sir ?" shouted Elliott,
the same whom we recently saw dismissed by
the lady. "I made the bet!"

" Then I mean you !" replied Barney, coolly.
"You are a scoundrel, sir-I will have sat
isfaction-you wear a sword !" shouted El-
liott, rising from his seat.
"Yes, but I only use my sword on enemies
worthy of my steel-on the foes of my coun-
try. In regard to the term you applied to me
I have but one response-what do you think of
my bootmaker ?"
As he said this, Barney most unexpectedly
applied the square toe of a heavy sea-boot to
that portion of Elliott's person which had last
been in contact with the chair. The latter,
backed by his friends, made a blow at Barney,
which the latter parried, and then with a tre-
mendous right-hander he visited Mr. Elliott's
frontispiece on the equinoctial line between
his eyes, causing him to take a celestial ob-
servation from a reclining posture. The fight
now became general. fcr all hands had plenty
of combative fluid aboard, and the ears of the
staid Quakers of the vicinity were shocked by
the shouts, yells and curses of the parties.
The noise awoke several watchmen from their
slumbers, who rushed to the scene, and after
the parties had got through the fight-te
citizens having knocked under to, or rather
been knocked under by, the officers--made a
general arrest of all those who were well
whipped, taking the words of honor c f the
others that they would appear at ten o'clock
the next morning before his worship the Alder-
man of the district.
Elliott and the most of his companions were
ingloriously lugged off to the watch-house,
havi' g had very little self inotive left in them,
though they were "fast boys."
Barney called for the bill, to which, at his
request, the landlord added the damages of
both parties, and promptly settled it,
"What made you pitch into that fellow  o
quick, Josh?" asked one of his compaonlud,
as the party were departing for their rooms.
"I felt a grudge against him the moment t
saw his face, that I couldn't exactly account
for; but when I heard him speak ofinsulting
a respectable woman, then I remembered that
I had a mother and a sister, and I boarded
him! I couldn't help it-I only wish he was
an Eoglishman !"
"He's worse--his father is a blasted old
tory   I only wonder that he is permitted to
live in the city," responded the other. "But
good night, Josh-I'il see you at the Alder-
man's ' in the mornit g. You'll be all right
there-it was his daughter that the puppy bet
he would kiss."

CH APTER V.
AN ALDERMAN OF THE OLDEN TIME.

It is almost impossible to find a fair repre-
sentative of 'an Alderman all of the olden
iume" now-a-days   One whose head is filled
with wise saws, grave morals, much law, and
t et not incapable at times of uttering an offi-
ei.l jest, or stiking a culprit into a sense of
iter nothingness by his frown. One with
t'e as radian'r as the sun seen through morn's
sil' ery mist-" round belly with fat capon
mel - and eyes capable of looking over the
,flicial spectacles rather than through them-
'yes capable of telling at a glance an honest
tm in from a rogue. Such a man, for instance,
my octogenarian friend Binna, the patriarch
tat her of the aldermanie tribe in this section.
On one occasion, when he demanded bail for
the' appearance of a man at court, an indi-
'imlual aepped forward and volunteered to be-
come surety for the accused.
I can t take you, sir," said the Alderman,
the mo =ment he looked at him.
" \Vh% "''asked the would-be surety, indig.

wa. arrested in the very azt of larceny, and
hr ug ht h-fore Alderman Binns. ' Didn't I say
tou'd eat if you had an opportunity V" said
the AIderman. as he made out a corumitment
for him     ut I'i yawing wildly off the
course of my story  pardon me, reader, and
l'll haul my tacts aboard and come by the
wind again.
On the next morning after the battle des-
cribed in the last chapter as occurring at the
-- Spread Eagle," a visitor to the office of his
worship. Alderman Bedford, would have seen
that gentleman, attended by his clerk, who
was none other than his lovely daughter, enter
the room from an inner apartment of his
house, for his office was in his dwelling, with
a satisfied air of importance on his counten-
ance and a huge volume of statutes under his
arm The hour was exactly fifty-five min-
utes after nins, by the huge old-fashioned gold
watch which, with a pound, more or less, of
seals attached, rested in a fob over over his
truly aldermanic paunch. I need not describe
him-in fact, I did so in the commencement of
this chapter.
It took him about five minutes to seat him-
self in the well.cushioned armchair behind his

desk, arrange his spectacles, etc.; then care-
fully brushing the shiny summit of his bald
head with a silk bandanna, and addressing
the beautiful girl who, pen in hand, had seat-
ed herself by his side, he was ready for bnsi
ness. But not an officer entered the door un-
til precisely ten o'clock, his hour for opening
court.
At the moment when that hour arrived, Mr.
Elliott and his companions were ushered in by
the guardians of the city's peace, all of them
looking much the worse for wear. A look of
malicious satisfaction crossed the beautiful
face of Cora, as, in the battered and bruised
face and tattered and bloody garments of El-
liott, she recognized her discarded suitor
Maddened and humiliated, he cast his eyes
down, biting his lips till the red hlood tric-
kled from them. In a few moments, Barney,
in his neat uniform.,cleanly appareled, an
looking as clear and fresh as a son of temper-
ance and half as handsome as an Apollo ap-
p~eared, attended by his companions, who, bay-
ing had a night's rest and the advantages of
lavation, looked as different from Elliott and
his woe-begone crew as daylight from dark-
ness.
" Who have we here? What is the charge?
have those dirty-looking rIffians been caught
in some nefarious action ?" asked the Alder-
man. Then turning to his daughter 'and
pointing to Elliott whom he did not recog-
nise, he said: "Mark that fellow, he has the
vwry look of a thief. Cora 1"
- Yes, father-be looks as if he'd been rob-
bing a hen-roostI" she replied, speaking loud
enough for him to hear her.
Tue captain of the watch now advanced to'
make his charge.
"Your honor," said he. ' last night, about
the hour of twelve, while these gallant young
officers were having a quiet little time all by
themselves at the 'Spread Eagle,' these here
chaps with the battered mugs-and ugly
mugs they have, as your worship might see
without even looking through your worship's
worshipful spectacles-these here fellows went
into their room and called for rum punch, of
which they'd had more than a full allowance
already. Then one of 'em said something
that offended this gallant young officer, who
had just got his commission for fighting so
well the other day down the river, and taking
a brig from the d-d Britishers--.-"

"Stop the-e!" said the Alderman to tne e ep-
tain, in a tone of offended dignity  - You
said d--d Britisbe'es, Mr. Crabstick. I hate
the British as bad as you do, sir-hut, mark
me, they mustn't be d'-d in this court. Anoth-
er oath, sir, and I fine you! Now go on with
your c rarge !"
you ebeg pardon, your honor," said the
abashed official. "As I was saying. that 'ere

peepers.  Then a general srlmmage com-
meeced, and we went in and ' pulled' the
worst of these fellows, and here they are.
The officers acted so like gentlemen that we
took their words of honor for their appear-
anc , and they ar' here to a man."
Woat did you strike that fellow for, sir ?"
asled the Alderman, addressing Barney.
1    astruc  him hecause he struck at me, sir
---hut had just kicked him. I commenced
the affray, and if your honor would let him
off I an willing to pay the fine.  I ve dark-
.ned lie top-lights and stove in Ike ivory
fe cwork about his head-rail, and he's been
pretty badly punished I''
I'm to be the judge of that. sir!' said the
ma'iat.rate, with a tone of dignity "Why
didvou kick him, sir?"
B-cause he spoke disrespectfully of a vir-
t'mou' hdy, sir-an! in my presence made, a
wrager that within a week he would kiss her
inibh-street; cad, sir, though I did not know
it then, and never had seen her-it' I had. I
you'd have knocked his head clear off his
shoulders-I am much mistaken if it was not
the lovely lady who sits by your side.  The
name which he bandied a'out amOng his dis-
'      solute and drunken companions was that of
Miss Cora Bedford !"
"D-n him! did he?     I'd have knocked
him down myself !" cried the excited Alder-
man. "Kiss my daughter in the street-my
Cora-the d-d villain '
"Father, father, you are.swearing !" said
the fair girl by his side, smi'ing, though her
face was suffused with blushes, for Barney's
eyes were fixed admiringly upon her.
"True, my child-true-the court is in

err'r. Tie court fines itself ! How many
times din I d-n him?'
"T"Twice, father," replied the fair clerk
"That's four shillings-d-n him again!
Now make it six, and charge it uainat me on
the docket!"
This act of justice disposed of, the Alder-
man turned to Elliott and addressed him :
"What is yonr name, where do you be-
long, and how do you make your living?
Speak up, you vagabond !"
My name is Henry Elliott, and you know
very well that I'm a gentleman, Mr. Alder-
man BedfordeI" said the fellow, looking as
fierce as he could through his half-closed
eyes.
eysnry Elliott-what, a son of old Elliot,
of Mulberry street ?"
"Yes, sir-and a visitor at your house!"
"Until I ordered him out of it for ,isult-
ing. re!" added Covet
i You are a pretty looking gentleman-you
and your companions there. If I meted out
fult justice to you, I would commit you to
prison, and cause you to travel'a few days on
the treadmill. It is a pity that whipping and
ducking are abolished! Ae it is, I fine you,
Mr. Gentleman Elliott, five pounds and costs,
and each of your companions one pound and
costs ! You can pay it now, or stand com-
mitted until you do !"
Tne mortified villain paid his fine and hur-
ried away, amid the sneers of those who were
present.
"pave 'we any fiues to pay, air?" asketi
Barney.
"No fines, but you are not to get off with-
out punishment, lieutenant! The court sen-
tences you to dins with it at three o'clock to-
day. Cora, you need not eater the sentence,
but don't forget it!"
"I'm sure I shall not, sir " ,said Barney,
again glancing at the beautiful girl. As their
eyes met, both blushed. What could be the
cause of that?
There being no other business before the
court, it adjourned, and the Alderman, at the
urgent request of Barney, visited the Sachem,
the new vessel which was being fitted out for
him.

THE TORY AND iS SOS.

A large, pompous-looking, red-faced gern-
tleman was pacing to and fr9 in a room which,
from its pictures and welIfided book shelves.
seemed to be his library. He held an ooen
letter in his hand, which he had jest been
reading.
A servant entered and asked :
"])id you ring for me, sir?"
"Yes, Francis ; where is my son? I wisht
to see him."
"He did not come home, sir. last night. '
said the servant, rather confusediy.
"Not come home, Eht? 1) 'you ku.W where
he is ?"
"Not exactly, sir-but I heard-or th it is
--the butler told me that he heard when he
went to market, that-"
The servant stammered and paused.
Well. go on, you fool-what are you hesi-
tating fort What did the butler hear?'
lie heard, sir, that Master Henry had been
in a fight last night. and got put in the watch-
house"
In the watch-house '-mnijsonin the watch-
honse   By the blood of the Plantagenets I'll
hay- atistaction for that!-I'd see my friend
Bedford! '
You may save yourself that trouble, sir
your friend Bedfoi d has just fined me five
ponnis for getting beaten by a naval officer,
who made a quarrel with me," said the son,
who was no other than Mr. Henry Elliott,
who that moment entered the room, and heard
the latter part of his father's remarks.
Heavens, Henry ! is it possible that that
is you, my eon?"
It don't feel much like me, but I believe it
is all that is left of me, sir!"
"How in Heaven's name did you get beaten
so? who did it? and what for?"
"It was done by a young officer, who got
offended about something that I said aboutold
Bedford's daughter. She did me the honor to
refuse ag  offer of marriage, yesterday, and it
made me mad."
"Refused you 7  She, the daughter of a fat
Alderman, who hardly kno*s who his grand-
fkther was?  She refused the son of Plantag-
enet Elliott, who can trace his pedigree back
to the Norman conquest, and has an income
of ten thousand pounds a year? Impossible ?"

"Nor im possible--but actually true '" said
the son
"I'm glad of it. Tne balance would have

my son ; he offers me protection to myself and
property, and a commission for you, if I will
go to New York. I have been thinking of it
for some time, and have converted the greater
part of my property into ready money."
"1'il accept the commission," muttered the
young man, "on condition that I'm not at-
tached to any permanent corps, which will
keep me away from one object. I am bound
to have revenge, both on the officer who beat
me, and on old Bedford and his daughter,
I've sworn to humble her pride, and I will.
She scorned to be my bride, but she yet shall
be my mistress ! And the sooner we leave
here, the better. I will not go into the street
to be sneered at after this disgrace!"
"It will take some time to remove those
marks so as to enable you to be fit to appear."
remarked the father. "Francis, go and tell
Dr. Minturn to come hereinstantly. You had
better retire to your room, Henry. I will re-
ply to Lord Howe--his messenger awaits, and
I have other news to send him. These ac-
cursed rebels will soon be crushed, and we
will be amply rewarded for our loyalty. I
wouldn't be surprised if I were knigh-ed-I
ought to be, for the blood of the Plantagenets
runs in my veins !"
This statement of the old tory was true---
the blood was illegitimate, in consequence of a
lack of virtue on the part of one of his female
ancestors.
Henry now retired to rest, and received chi-
surgic care, while his father attended to his
treasonable correspondence.

THE BOQUET.

"When will you have your craft ready for
sea, sir?" asked Commodore Hopkins, when
he approached Barney.
"Within four days, sir-possibly in three."
"You have been in a hurry, air."
"I have, commodore  I owe the English a
grudge, and I want to be hammering away at
them again."
"Well, sir, you'll soon have a chance. They
are ranging all along our coast. I hope your
good fortune will continue, and that you will
soon bring in' some more prizes."
"Thank you. commodore. If Capt. Alex.
ander has no objection, I would ask afavor !"
"I would refuse you nothing, my dear fel-
low," said the last named officer.
"One of your quarter gunners, Jim Thomp-
son, wants to be transferred to my command.
I owe the follow a grudge, for be killed the
captain of the brig, you remember."
" Yes, and saved your life. That's a strange
thine to hold a grudge against.a man for."
S'' Well, it was a matter of precedence-the
officer was my game. But can I have the
man, sir ?'             '      .'
"Certainly ; he is a good seaman, and I'll
spare him to you. And now, comrmodore, if
you and the officers will have the kindness to
step into the little cabin of the Sachem, I will..
produce an excellent fogmatie in the shape of
some fine old Jamaica. It must he good, for
it was imported expressly for our use in the
brig whichthe Wasp captured the other day I"
The officers of course would not injure the
reputation of the service by refusing an invi--
tation of that kind, and soon were in Barney's
snug little cabin.
"Ah, Mr. Barney, here's a signal that you've
been within hail of some other craft than the
British brig-brought her to, maybe, for Isee
you've captured the colors!" cried the com-
modo're p iming t' a bouquet, which, for want
of a flower vase, was stuck in the neck of a
porter bottle
"The colors are red, white and blue. com-
modore, and shallnever be struck to or by me,
while I live. That nosegay was sent to me
from shore by some one, I know not whom--
but a patriot I suppose, from the choice of
colors."
' And one that wants a place in your mem-
ory," said Alexander, pointing to the forget-
me'nots.

"Some favored fair. Be careful, lieutenant,
that some of the handsome Quaker girls don't
win you over on the peace question. By-the-
way, some one mentioned to me that some of
you young officers thrashed some of the citi-
zens night before last; how was it ?"
',I only punished a puppy for insulting me
and threatening to insult a lady, sir.- It wasa
trifling affair, not worth mentioning," said
Barney.
"Perhaps so-but you must be cautious
about offending the citizens or getting into
difficulty with them. Our navy is in its in-
fancy-if people become prejudiced against
the child, it will be fed badly, and will grow
slowly."
"True, sir-butI was provoked into this
quarrel. The parties who forced the trouble
on were very heavily fined."
" And were you not punished ?"
"Yes, sir-I was forced to eat an excellent
dinner with the magistrate, who keeps the
best wine in the city I"
"I shouldn't mind receiving such punish-
ment occasionally myself," said Alexander.
"I think, as St. Paul said to Timothy, I could
'take it for my stomach's sake."
"And 'thine often infirmities,' added Bar-
ney, with a laugh. "But, gentlemen, this
isn't the rum. There it is, 'in the original
package,' as other importers say; here is some
sugar which came from the same market, and
those lemons were also consigned to us by his
Britannic majesty's brig Tender. Help yout-
selves."
Soon the anti-fogmatic, prepared according
to a recipe .of the celebrated Phineas Car-
buncle, was mixed, and success to the Sachem
and her brave young commander was drank.
Alexander, who only wanted a good excuse to
repeat the dose, proposed the health of the fair
iucognito who had sent Barney the bouquet.
This brought a blush to our hero's cheek, and a
second.glass to his lips; then he excused him-
self and hastened to his duty.
"That young man will be an honor to -the
service I" said the commodore. "He has got
just enough of the devil in him to get him into
scrapes, and is cool enough to work his way,
out of them. I only hope he won't make a fool
of himself by falling in love? A fellow in love
ia't worth much aboard ship i"
"Permit me to disagree with you, commo-

dore !' said Captain Alexander.  "I don't
care how much a fellow is in love, provided
he don't get married, and knock the romance
of the thing overboard. While he is in love,
he is ever ambitious to distinguish himself,
and win the admiration of her whose affections
he would secure. He is anxious to outdo all
others, often almost rash and desperate ; but I
agree with you that after he is married, he is

careful of his life, apt to be homesick, and
rather a shaky stick I"
"You may be right, sir," replied the old
commodore, "but all that I want my officers
to do now is to love their flag and do their
duty. But we will pay a visit to the Wasp
now, and see how she looks."
The officers departed, not, however, without
again complimenting Barney on his skill and
promptness in getting his craft ready for sea.

gave him a bachelor's button, just to see what
he'd say !"
"What did he say, Eliza?"
"Why, he said, ma'am, that posies was well
in their way, for them that liked them, but he
liked the smell of fresh tar better !"
"Was that all?"
"Not exactly, ma'am. He said my cheeks
looked like thesouthern side of a couple of big
red apples, just ripe and fit for eating !"
"Well, what answer did you make-did
you tell him to take a bite I"
"No, ma'am-for just then the lieutenant
came on to the wharf and made a bow as po-
lite as if I was a lady. I curtsied clear to the
ground. 'Are those flowers for me, my pret-
ty maid?' he asked. 'Yes, sir, they be,' I
said. 'Then you are the fairy messenger that
brought me a bouquet yesterday,' he said. 'I
be,' I said. 'There is a guinea for you, my
pretty maid,' he said-' and now you'll tellme
who sent them, will you not?' 'I can't,' said
I-' my mistress told me not to!' 'I saw you
at Alderman Bedford's a couple of days ago
didn't I?' he asked. 'In course you did, sir!'
said I."
"Then you let the cat out of the bag, you
stupid girl !" cried Cora, half in anger.
" Lawks, no, ma'am, I didn't-I hadn't no
cat. nor any bag either-though I did think,
before I started, of taking the old gray cat's
litter of kittens down and drowning them,
they're a mewling around in the way, and
aren't of any use !"
"Did the lieutenant say no more ?"
"Yes, ma'am-he asked if you were well.

Another morning had arrived. The sun,
audacious dog, had just peeped in through the
delicate curtain of the eastern window of Miss
Cora Bedford's chamber, and had actually
caught her in a lovely undress, making a morn-
ing toilet ; but not having a tongue, though
eyes he surely hath, he could not reveal the
secret mysteries by which the sex make them-
selves so angelic in appearance in the morn-
ing. A man generally gets up drowsy-eyed
and yawning, comes forth with frowsy hair,
not always with "unwrinkled front," espe-
cially in the linen line-looking for all the
world like a Dutch doll washedin dirty water
and badly ironed out.
Miss Cora had not quite finished her toilet,
when, with the freedom of a petted servant,
Eliza, her handmaiden, entered.
"I've seen him  again, Miss Cora !" she
cried. "I thought i'd promenade a little in
the. staluberous air before you got up, so I
picked a bunch of flowers and went down to
the side of the river, and there I met him a

"Who, the lieutenant. Eliza?"
"No, ma'am--Jim Thompson-him that

paved the leftenant's life."
" Ah ! your new substitute for the poor late
lamented Corporal Drill!"
"There you are again about that lobster-

"So is mine, ma'am, the atmosphere is so

"Yes, fair lady. I merely came on shore to
bid yopreelf and father farewell, and to thank
you for your kindness to me. Also, 10 say
that if ever the arm of Joshua Barney can
render you any aid, it and his life are devotedly
at your service.  Times are perilous - the
chances of war are precarious. Although I
have sot the slightest doubt that the ultimate
result of this war will be our independence,
and it recognized by England and all the
world; et long and bloody may be the strug-
gle. We are weak in numbers, in munitions,
in money, in friends; strong only in the justice
of our cause. New York is already in the
hands of the enemy. With a powerful army
on shore, and an immense fleet afloat, they
will probably turn their eyes to this city, and,

conquest, they probably may take it. If so,
you must fly to the interior-they never will
dare to force our countrymen to battle in the
forest and amid the defiles of the mountains.
If they do, we will slay them as the hurter
does the deer, by thousands. My duty will be
upon the ocean, the bay and the river. If I

live and ever can serve you, depend upon
me!'
"We will, Mr. Barney," said Cora. "but
you paint a gloomy picture. Let us hope for
the best, and most especially will my father
and myself pray for your safety"
"Yes, it is a gloomy picture," added the
worthy Alderman. "Bring up a bottle of
port, Cora, darling, and let us see if e cannot
rigaten the colors a little l"
It was a sadly pleasant evening which Bar-
ney passed, and, at an early hour for him, he
arose to retire. Tears were glistening like
diamonds in the beautiful eyes of Cora as she
bade him farewell. Nor did she withdraw the
trembling hand which he pressed to his lips.
"Good bye--God bless you, lieutenant! I
wish you good luck and plenty of prize money,
without a scar to mar your good looks !'' said
the Alderman, as he warmly shook his hand.

at Cora-" but the boat shall be sent'g
Another lingering look-once more the sad
farewell repeated, and then the young officer
hastened to his vessel.
o' one thing he felt certain--if Cora did
not exactly love him, she felt an interest in
him, a very friendly interest, and took no pains
to conceal it. Another thing he knew.  ie

General Howe sat in his private apartment
at his quarters in the city of New York. The
table before him was covered with papers and
maps. A look of care and aoxrety pervaded
his countenance. lie had just dismissed a
council of officers, and was determining upon
a plan to force Washington, with his ill-fed,
unpaid, half-elothed and discontended army,
into a a general action, by which at a blow
he could crush him. He was, in fact, plan-
ning the movements which, by the activity,
restless daring and consuniinste skill of the
American chief, were foiled no  te plaius of

movements as lie retreated towedr' Morris-

The eyes of the younger Elliott flashed
with joy as he heard this.
"The city is not very well guarded, is it?"
asked the general.
"The city is not, general," said the young
man-" but the river below has several pas-
ses which are strongly fortified. If the city
was once captured by land, by a force march-
ing from here, or landing frorm the Chesa-
peake, and crossing over, then the rebels
might desert their works in the river."
" True, my young friend-you seem to have
some idea of military movements. Would
the citizens of Philadelphia  e apt to resist
the occupation of the city very strongly ?"
"Very many of them, general, are Quakers.

on the rebel side, although they lean that -
way.

you for your uniforms. You are under paty
from the date of your father's letter acceptin'
my propositions."
" Thank you, General. You will ever find
me loyal."
After they had withdra wn from the audi-
ence, the younger Elliott no longer concealed
from his father the joy which fitted his breast
as he heard Howe reveal his intention of taking
Philadelphia.
"My day of revenge is not far distant" he
cried. "I'll make three hearts bleed. They
shall rue and remember the day when they
humiliated Henry Elliott!"
"That's right, my brave boy l" said thd
father. "You have the blood of the Plautag-
nets in your veins."

"I knowed it! Didn't I tell you last night,
eap'n, that we'd he lyin' tew beforedai light I"
said Yarnall, as Barney came on deck on the
morning after the Sachem bad left the Capes
of the Delaware.
' Is there anything in sight!' asked the
young commander.
Nothing but clouds and water, both of 'em
as rough as a Christian's road tew glory," re-
plied the lieutenant.
"It is cold and raw this morning," contin-
ued the commander.
"I was jest a thinhin' it was. I don't think

"No, I think not, Mr. Yarnall; I'll take

the experiment"
"Thankee, cap'n ; our decks won't need

pitchia' intew 'em like fun for the last three
hours."
The lieutenant now shook himself like a

descended to test the chemical properties of
sugar, Jamaica rum, and a slight dilution of
water. He bad been gone but a short time,
when the man at the mast-head, stationed as a
look out, sung cut:
" Sail ho I"
"Where away ?' asked Barney.
"Broad on the weatherbow, sir."
"What is she?'
"I can't exactly tell, sir, she and we are
heaving and pitching so. She is square rigged,
though, and lying to on the same tack that we
arc,
"A sail in sight, eh, sir?" said Yarnall,
coming on deck, with his color slightly im-
proved. "I cale'lated on seem' one jest about
this time o' day. If she drifts more than we.
do, she'll come within hail before night. I
foresee that"
"I wish the water was smoother-in fight-
ing and working condition, at least," mutter-
ed Barney.
"It will heAafter the blow is over-I cale'-
late on that sure," said Yarnall, looking very
wise.
To one unused to the ne aat this time the
prospect from the deck of the Sachem would
have seemed terrible. But to a lover of the
grand and magnificent ; to a sailor with poetry
in his heart ; to one who can recognize the

power of God in the tempest-in the sky-kiss-
ing waves-in the wilderness, as it sways to
the unseen hands of the mighty winmd-aswell
as in each lovely hue, each tender vein of the
frailest flowers which beautify the earth, it
was glorious. The dark blue waves, shadowed
by the rushing clouds, tipped and crested
with foam, like great snow-capped mountains,
rolled very high. The vessel at one time
seemed to climb their precipitous sides; then
again, with rapid plunge, she would dart down
into the deep water-vales, seeming as if she
was about to dive to the unknown depths of
the ocean. The wind sung through the rig-
ging, playing, as it were, "on a carp of a
thousand strings," and straining ta little can-
vas which was exposed to its fury almost to
bursting.
This was no day for exercise at arms  Toe
battery was secured with extra tackles, and
carefully housed wilh tarpaulius; the hatches
were battened down, preventer braces and
stays rove and taughtened-everythiog done,
in fact, which consummate seamarsip and
prudence dictated  Fortunately the wind was
blowing off shore, so that there was no danger
under their lee. There is nothing which a
thorough sailor dreads more than the prox-
imity of land when a gale of wind is blowing
or coming on.
As the day wore on, many an eye was turned
toward the sail which had been diseove
first after daylight. She evidently.drfted faster
than the Sachem, for by three o'clock in te
afternoon she could be seen from the deck of
the latter, and her rig-'-that of a brig-distin-
guished. But colors were not hoisted by
either vessel, for it lIlew rather too hard to
show bunting, and entirely too bara for ves-
sels to attempt toelose with each other in any
thing like hailing distance.
When night came on, the vessels were not
more than six or seven, miles apart, the brig
being on the weather beam, instoud of the
weather bow, of the Sachem .
"I reckon that's a cussed Englisher," said
Yarnsll, as he took a look at her just before
dark ; "and I foresee that if she keeps on
drifting, she'll be just two miles on our lee
quarter in the morning."
"Well,,a go9dtook-out must be kept for
1 her, especially if it lulls during the night. She
might edge down on us before we were ready,"
said Barney.

and a guernsey shirt-he wore a silk handker-
chief wound tight around his head. a his
waist belt were stuck a pair of bell-mouthed
long brass pistols, which would have carried
over an ounce ball, but which, for better effect
in a crowd, he had loaded writh buekaot,-a
handful to each. A large butcher knife, in a
leatnern scabbard, was also stuck in the same
belt. He held in his hand a weapon wheh he
had christened his "patent amputator, ' a cut.
las which had been made to order expressly
for him. It was baestet-nilted,straight, double-
edged, and weighed at least fifteen or sixteen
pounds. In his powerful grasp, it was, indeed,
a terrible weapon. With ius blueish, passion-
less face-his cool and calculating air and
peculiar dress, ne formed a picture worthy
even of a more minute description than I am
giving.
The crew were now all ready, the magazine
opened, and every one at bi' post.
" It is about time that th'e ball opened, Mr.
Yarnall," said Barney.
"I was jest a thinking so, cap'n," replied
the lieutenant. "Shan't I step below to see
what time it is, so tew enter it on the log? I
foresee that we'll take that 'ere Johny Bull in
one hour and fifteen minutes by the watch."
"Time her if you want to," said Barney,
laughing, who suspected, and not without rea-
son, that Yarnall wanted to pay his respects
to his favorite "sperrits " before going- to
work.
Edging down until within about a mile of
the Englishman, who, under her fore course,
two topsails, main spencer and jib, was wait.
ing for them, Barney hauled up on a wind and
hove the Sacheim to.
"Now, JimThompson, I want to see what
you can do with your long Tom, there i" he
cried to his gunner. "Try not tohit the spars
of the brig, I want them to stand, so that I
can take her into port, but pitch the iron into
her hull. Try and dismount some of her
guns."
"Ay, ay, sir," said the brave old seaman,
slowing his gup around on its pivot, and ela.
* vating it for the range. After it was carefully
sighted,-he applied the match, and with a an
len and spiterl roar at "spoke out," and sent
its whizzig messenger across the water.

The day wore on, and after the sun had
reached its meridian, the strength of the wind
perceptibly began to decrease. The British
brig, evidently much heavier in tonnage and
metal, as well as more fully armed than the
Sacem. showed no disposition to escape or
avoil a'combat. As the sea began to go down
with the wind, Barney hoped to be able to en-
gage her before night ; but when the sun went
down the sea was still too high to attempt to
do anything with the battery. As soon as it
was dare: the British vessel hoisted a light.
)erertined not to be outdone in politeness,
Barney did the same, giving orders to keep
a vigila'it watch upon the movements of the
other.
It was an anxious night with him. The wind
was rapidly sinking, the sea falling in height
all the time-a prospect, yes, a certainty, of a
desperate struggle with a powerful foe as soon
as h nere was light enough to work with advan-
tage. He did-not retire at all, but, wrapped in
his sea cloak, paced the deck during the entire
night, often glancing at the light which rose
and fell upon tae heaving waves so near tohim.
The cre w had their usual rest, being on watch
and watch.
At last, the welcome light of day appeared,
and Barney saw that the wind and sea had
sufficiently fallen to enable him to engage his
opponent At sunrise, his colors were hoisted,
and replied to by the enemy. But'determined
to give his ruen every advantage in his power,
ne gave them ample time for breakfast, and.
advised by the thoughtful Mr. Yarnall, doubled
their ration of "spirits."
It was between eight and nine o'clock when
he beat to quarters and cleared for action.
Tne brig was so close that her drum and fife
could be distinctly heard as she followed the
example. Her commander had evidently
taken matters just about as coolly ss Barney
had                                i
Sail wag now made upon both vessels, and
the Sachem began to edge down upon the
brig. She had the advantage only in being to
windward, and being thus enabled to choose
a distance suitable to work her long eighteen
to the best effect.
Yarnall was in his fighting rig. Hi1 long.

Barney watched the result through his spy-
gla's.
Depress your gun a trifle; that shot went
two feet above hu hammock nettings, and
through the foot of his foresail," said Barney.
At this moment, a range of smoke and fire
belched out from the side of the brig, and the
thunder of her whole broadside was heard.
But it was poorly directed-the guns were not
sufficiently elevated, or fires in range. Only
one shot came near the Sachem and thatstruck
the water close to her, and ricocheted clear
over her hull, making a hole in a sail. The
spray from it, however, took Yarnall in the
breast and face, as he leaned over the lee bul-
warks looking at the brig.
"Darn 'em!l" he muttered, "I knowed they'd
go to splashing a feller all over with saltwater.
if id my bran new uniform on it would have
been all the same tew them,!"
Thompson had by this time re-loaded his
gun, and, having measured his distance, he
sent his second shot crashing through the bul-
warks of the brig.
Well done-you've begun to stir themup!"
said Barney. "Keep the game up. Mr. Yar-
nall, you may open with the lee battery ; be
careful not to throw away a shot.''
"No fear, cap'n-1 never was brought up
tew waste iron. I'll be as keerful as I can."
The action now became general. Although
tue carronades were not very effective at the
dioin:ce, the long uun of tle Sachem told with
terrirle fiect-splinters whitened the side, of
the Eeoglist brig every time that it was dis-

now kicking a powder-monkey for not hurry-

a wounded man out of the way of the guns,
making all the while, in his own dry way,
quaint remarks, which, even in that exciting
and terrible hour, brought peals of laughter
rom the men.
A shot from the enemy having shattered the
head of a poor fellow near him, who had often
annoyed him by his stupidity, and covered him
with blood and brains, he remarked, as he
cooly wiped his face:
" Who'd have thought that Bill Jenkins had
brains-he hardly knowed enough tew keep
himself out of the fire 1"
The smoke now became so dense, as it swept
down upon the brig, that she could scarcely
be seen by the men on board of the Sachem,
R ho, however, kept up a fire at the flash and
report of her guns.
Barney now began to think of bringing the
matter to a decision by closing up.
Bidding the boarders to prepare for work,
under cover of the smoke of a heavy broadside,
he squared away, double shotting his larboard
battery with grape and canister, intending to

Every thing met his plans to a charm. He
was close aboard before the commander of the
brig saw his intention, and it was toe late for
the latter to entirely evade the raking broad-
side. however, he put his helm hard up the
moment that the Sachem's sails loomed out of
the smoke, closeaboard; butthis only brought
the sooner in contact as the Sachem luffed up.
The instant that their hulls crashedtogether,
Barney ano Yarnall, heading their men, leaped
on board the brig. They were met by the
officers and crew of the brig with a determined
front, and a terrible struggle for the mastry
ensued.  The clear shout of Barney--the
hoarse cry of Yarnall, as he literally mowed a
swathe with his huge cutlas--rung high
above the cheers of the combatants, the yells
of the wounded, and the groans of the dying.
The deck was slipperywith blood.' The smoke
rose like a frowning storm-cloud above the
combatants, for steel was to decide the battle
now. Theimpetuosity of Barney's crew drove
the English back to their quarter-deck, but
here they formed; and with a bristling row of
boarding pikes madd a hedge of steel. Yar-
nail's right arm at this moment was disabled
by a shot. Until now, he had not seemed to
think of his huge mouthed pistols. But losing
the use of his sword-hand freshened his me-
mory, and drawing them in succession with
his left hand, he fired them in the faces of the
close clustered men. The heavy loads scat-
tered death in the ranks. The commander of
the brig and two other officers fell.
"Darn ye, I thought that 're hail storm
would bother ye !" shouted Yarnall, drawing
his butcher knife, and plunging into the melee
again.
"Quarter 1" yelled a seaman, into whom
he drove the long blade up to the wooden
handle.
"Why didn't you speak sooner, you tarnal
fool?" he cried, as he drew forth the reeliag
weapon just in time to parry a pike which was
within a few inches of his breast.
"Keep your tarnal fish spear to yourself !"
he said, as he sprang inside of the reach ofthe
man who held it, and, with a kick from his
huge foot, hitting the man in the pit of the
stomach, made him double up and yell as if.
he was mortally wounded.
The English, having no officer to encourage
them, were now completely disheartene
Their cries for quarter reached the ears of
Barney, and seeing that their flag was i'a - I
down, be at once bade his crew cease t'   r
terrible havoc.
The moment that it was over, Yarnali wr-et
on board the Sachem, and descended into 'he

I've got nails and teeth, and a butcher knife,
and--ob, Lord? he's come!"
" Wno ?" cried Cora, as she saw Eliza, who
was looking out of the window, turn pale as
death.
"Oh, its Corporal Drill!  I wish that Jim
Thompson was here, or your lieutenant Lord
ha' mercy on me, a sinner! they're a coming
right across the street, a whole dozen on 'em,
with an ossifer at their head!1"
Cora turned pale, too, for she had recog-
ntzed that officer, and in him an enemy whom
she had last seen under far different circum-
stan cets,
What his feelings and intentions were might
best be inferred from the fact that, without
paying the slightest respect to the rules or
courtesy, he entered the house without per-
mission, or even knocking at the door, and in
a moment, followed by twelve armed men, he
entered the drawing-room, in which Cora
Bedford stood, not pale now, but red with
rage.
"What means this intrusion?" she asked,
and her dark eye flashed like fire as she
spoke.
"You know me, Miss Bedford, do you not?"
said the officer.
"Yes, Henry Elliott, I know you as a tory
and a villain. a traitor and a puppy--know
you as the liveried servant of a base tyrant I"
You had better be sparing of your abuse,
my fair and haughty maiden. You are in my
power now
"Never, wretch, while I hold my own life
in my hands!' sue said, bitterly, her proud
form swelling in queenly pride as she spoke
"We'll see !" tneered the cificer. "Where
is your father? My business for the time is
with him. Your case shall meet my earliest
attention after I dispose of him!'
"What do you mean, vile monster, in re-
gard to my rather? Ie is sick-nigh unto
death's door! '
Not so sick but that he can be removed
to prison, 1 expect " said the fiendish brute
"To prison ? Oh, God, Henry Elliott, you
dare not!"
"I dare anything. Cora Bedford ! I am the
favorite aid of the British general, and have
my own way in regard to matters !"
"But my father is helpless--to remove him
from his room would be instant death if he
must die, kill him in his bed, and stain your
coward hand with my blood I"
"On, no--I shall reserve you for a pleasant-
er fate, Miss Corn; I have not forgo ten my
love S et !" said the villain, with a look whien
made tbe poor girl shudder wi'h horror.
"If your fattier is too ill to be removed at
present. it will not prevent my putting a guard
over him ; and as 1, am peruitteu to choose
my own qiiar ors, I shall become your guest.,
though p,-rbaps rather an unwelcome one, for
the time

"Most unwelcome ; but if you are so base
and dastardly as to force yourself under this
roof, I can confine myself to my poor father's
sick room !"
"As' you please ; but remember that you
will not be permitted to leave this house with-
out my permission !"
"I shall not leave my father's side, sir!"
said the maiden.
"Corporal Drill, you with your party will
take up your quarters in this house, and see
that none of its inmates depart without my
permission."
"Yes. sir," said the corporal, giving the
soldier's salute as he drew his stiff bode up to
its lull height, and brought his musket from a
"shoulder 'to a "carry."
"My duties at headquarters deprive me of
the pleas re of remaining in your company at
present, I iss Bedford," said the officer, with
monk politeness-" but I will return at an
early hour this evening, and hope then to find
you in a more amiable humor!"
Toe instaut le left the room. Cora hurried
to her father Eiza was about to follow, when
Drill, who had laid aside his musket, stretched
our his arms as if to embrace her, and said;
"Eliza. old sweetheart: don't e know me-
yours to command, Timothy Drill, first cor-
poral in his majesty's sixty-first foot?'
"Yes, I de know you, you old lobster-back,
and I don't know no good of you, nor your
vile audacious master neither!''
"Why, 'Liza, you ain't agoin' to file off and
turn the left shoulder on me, your own Timo-
thy, are your!'
"Yes, I be! I despise you! You're worse
than a gorgian monster, so you are !"
"Whew! I smell powder t Some one has
been foraging around the camp since I was
here. You ve found some other lover, eh?"
"If I have, he's a better lookin' man than
you be, and if he was here now, he d 'nihilate
you to atoms, so he would! if you've got to
stay in this ere house, you mas keep your
tongue to yourself-I won't have nothing to do
with you
"Well, you'll introduce us to the cook, won't
you?   Ws musn't starve in the midst of
plenty'"
"Yes, I'll introduce you to the cook. She's
a Digger, and '11 just suit you. I hope she'll
pizen your wittles !"
"No danger of that--we'll make her eat a
part of all she cooks
' Do-she's just fit to set down to tale with
a lot of mean grinoramuses like you!' cried
Eliza, as she darted past the corporal, and fol-
lowed her mistress.
"Your old sweetheart, that you've been
bragLimg of, is as sour as vinegar!" said one
or toe sildiers.
"She used to be as sweet as honey !" said
Drill, wirhasigh  "Women is like powder: if
you doa't lake care of it. it's dead sure to

spoil. Then agin, women, in another sense, is
like powder: they'll go off with a spark at
any time. Then, agin, women is like powder,

women is like powder, because they're dan-
gerous to handle. Then, agin, women is like

ain't good for much afterwards."
After this lengthened opinion, the corporal
glanced toward the sideboard, upon which, as
was usual in those days, stood several decan-
ters of liquor.

"As we're quarterod here, it's wrong for us
to suffer thirst !" he said.
And, to show that he really believed his
statement, and spoke conscientiously, he at
once filled a large tumbler, and drank it off.
"wThat's old Jamaica, and has the real
smack I" said he, as he put the glass down.
"So has my hand!" 'cried Eliza, as her palm
came in contact with his cheek, for she at that
instant re-entered the room.
"Oh, if you wasn't a woman I" muttered
the corporal, as he rubbed his stinging cheek.
"If I wasn't a woman, I'd be a man, and I'd
kick you out of doors !" she cried, as she went
into another apartment.

"tOpen the door, Cato, and if it is him, stay

The negro obeyed, and an officer attired
in a gay uniform, entered the squalid apart-
ment. Tue lady did not rise from the broken
backed chair in which she sat, but her pale
face flsheld as she looked upon him--who
was none other than Henry E tiott.
"My Godl, Caroline! you here, and in this
a station ?" he exclaimed, in a tone of surprise.
Why should you be astonished to find me
here, and in tVis situation ?" she said, in a bit-
ter tone.  ' You, who left me alone and pen-
niless--me, the wretched mother of your idiot
child-when you knew that for you I was an
outcast from friends and home"
"But, Caroline, I was forced to leave sud-

sneers of every one who knew you, you

"Have you done, Caroline?" he asked, in
a cold and natter tone.

"I shall have nothing more, personally, to
do with you?" he replied. "But there is
money !" he added, as he threw a purse of gold
into her lap. "Get what you require, and
trouble me no more!
"The price of treason!" she muttered, as
she regarded the money. "It is fitting that
sunken virtue and the offspring of guilt should
live on it !
Raising her dark eyes again to Elliott's face,
she asked:
"Have you seen Cora Bedford yet?"
"I have," he replied, as a gleam of triumph
shot athwart his face. "I have taken up my
quarters in her father's house, and I'll teach
the proud girl a harsher lesson than you have
ever learned. She shall yet envy the position
I but now found you in. But 1 must be off.

The officer did not wait for a reply, but
arose, and abruptly left the room.
"Quartered at Alderman Bedford's, eh?
Poor Cora is yet to learn a harsher lesson than
I have? Not by your hand, Henry Elliott, if
I have to slay you myself !" muttered she. "I
will befriend the poor girl : lost and ruined
though I am, I may yet save her-save her
from the dark intentions of that hell-spawned
miscreant!"
She paused, and seemed for a time to be lost
in thought. The negro entered the room.
"Can't ole Cato do nuffin' for you, misse? "
he asked.
Her eye glanced at the purse in her lap.
"Yes, Cato," she replied. "To-night, after

"No, Cato-you have shared my poverty,

"Be them red-backed lobsters going tostay

"A Hottentot, you mean, I suppose, Eliza I"

"There's the parlor bell ringing-I suppose

She returned in a moment, and said :

"Tell him I am ousy-I am with my sick

"I will go there 1'' said Cora, with her eyes

"Fear not, dear father. I put my trust in
God. The wretch dare not go too far ! I am
not entirely in his power. God help me if I
was !"
She shuddered as the thought sped across
her mind. Then, accompanied by her maid,
she went into the room where Elliott was seat-
ed.
"Am I wanted for anything special ?" she
asked, haughtily, as she stood confronting him.
"Yes, Miss bedford--but as our conversa-
tion will not be very brief, you had better be
seated."
" It must he brief on my part, sir, and I prefer
standing. My father requires my constant at-
tendance.  Say what you have to say, and
permit me to retire."
"Really, Miss Cora, that look of anger, and
your heightened color, becomes your style of
beauty remarkably well."
"If you only sent for me to insult me, sir, I
will leave you"
"KNo-no ! Have the kindness to remain a
moment. I have some written orders from my
general; which I wish to read to you."
'They do not interest me, sir-obey them
for all I care 1"
"Bat they do interest you, haughty lady,
and I shall obey them!  Tie first is an order
to keep a strict armed surveillance over your
father until he recovers sufficiently to be taken
to a safer prison. The second assigns quar-
ters for myself and guard in this house. You
are aware, of course, that in war time we are
biletted on the enemy 1"
"Well, sir, have you done ?"
"So far as the orders are concerned, but
now that I am a guest, even though an unwel-
come one, I hope my lovely hostess will not
deny me the pleasure of a few moment's con-
versation occasionally, to remind me of the
past, when I was more welcome than I am
now. I can only say to her. that the more
agreeable she is to to me, the more pleasant it
will be for herself and those who dwell under
this roof."
"The less I have to say to you. sir, the bet-

mistress, who left the room
' By Jove, I'll soon tame that pride !" mut-

drank toe contents of a glass filled to the brim

A half hour later he was in the presence o

CHAPTER XXt.
TEE CRUISE or THEA.HEM.

For some time our friend Barney has been
lost sight of; but do not deem that he, with
his daring heart, ardent spirit, and towering
ahirionhas been idle.
Four months had gone by since he had
passed the Capes of the Delaware, bound sea-
ward, and many aprize had been taken by the
Sachem. At last, however, the news that
Philadelphia had been occupied by the enemy
reached his ears, from an outward bound ves
el which he had captured.     h
"I knowed they d have Philadelphy ?' said
Yarnall, when the news was communieated.
"By heavens, they won't keep it long !"
said Barney, in much agitation, as he paced
his deck after hearing it.
"Do you mean to try to retake it with the
Sachem? 'asked the first luff, in his dry way.
"If you do, I forsee some trouble."  -
"If I can do nothing by way of ret'akingit,"
said Barney, " I can collect a squadron which
will help to starve them out. If Washington
will only blockade them by land, I'll do it by
water. But, Yarnall, I'm going to look: inte
the bay ; I'm bound to visit Philadelphia, if it
costamy life i"
"Or liberty! I knowed you would! Darn
the women!" muttered Yarnall.
"What do you mean, sir?" asked theyoung
commander, sternly.
"Why, ap ,there's no use of your fiarin'
up about it-I didn't go for to rile you-but
ever since them poises or nosegays come
aboard at Philadelphy, I knowed you was in
love there. I've watched'you many a night a
w akin' the deck, and a lookin' at the stars,
and a talkin' t yourself or somebody that
din't hear you, and I foresaw matrimony
looming up atween you and t'other Bend of
life. So now you want to put into Delaware
Bay and up the river, like as not when it's as
thick covered with British ships as the Chesa.
peake is with canvas-backs in December!"
"If you are afraid, you need not go with
me, sir "
"Me afeard, eap'n ? Did you ever see me
beck one inch from anything human, inferna
or divine? By jingo, it's time that I left when
you twit me with being' a coward! I didn't
foresee that!1"
"Forgive me, Yarnall; I didn't mean to in
sinuate that you were a coward. There's my
hand on it. I have ever found you the braves
of the brave!"-
"Tarnal Jerusalem! I knowed you'd sa3
that, cp'n ; and now jest head the craft right
for Delaware Capes, and see if Ned Yarnal
banks an inch from youe. Jitmnpin' Moses,7
know what it is to be in love myself. I love

a gal down on the Cape once---loved her worse
than p'isen. A Dutch Jew pedlar got ier,
though-bought her off from me, after she'd
promised to share my fortin, with a sixpenny
calico dress and a string of gold beads, and
cheatedher at that, for the gold turned green
afore she'd been spliced a week. I hain't had
notbin' to do with women folks since then.
They're like a coral reef' in smooth water-
mighty deceivin'. If once you run ashore on .
it, you're chawed up in a hurry. The 'Ca'pes,
by our last observation, ought to bear about
weet-nor'west-distant about one hundred
and fifty-odd miles."
Yes, you can keep her away. Our course
will keep the wind on the quarter. If the
breeze lasts, we can slip in in the night, or a
little before daylight at least.'
" Yes, sir ; but wouldn't it be well to go in
shabby like? We ve got enough cargo in of
-the right sort to pass as a transport, if any of
the Engliehers should overhaul us. If we can
get up the river safe, I know a creek on the
Jarsey side where we can stow the craft sosafe
_ that nothin' can find her from the water side,
and nothin' be apt to come from the land
without they like wadin' in the swamp. Ie
up Rancosas."
"We will try and get the craft in there,
then. If the worst comes, and we are in dan-
ger of being taken, we can run the craft ashore
and burn her. Then we can join the Torces
on land."
"And make boss marines of ourselves,
cap'n ? That would be jolly. I never rid a
boss but once, and I got a h'ist then that I
shan't forgit afore I stop chain' tobaccy. II
kInowed I would afore I straddled the animal

CHAPTER XXII.
LOVE'S STRATAGEM.

A short time after Elliott had taken the ne-
gro Cato into his service, he was called upon
by a smart looking lad, who appeared to be
a"out ixteen or seventeen, who asked if he
did not want a servant. The young fellow
was neatly dressed, and very good looking.
his appearan ce rather prepossessed the lieu-
tenant in his favor, although there seemed a
lttle of the devil in his black eyes.
"Why do you seek to enter my service?"
asked E iliott.
Because I have no home. Iam too young
to be a soldier, and want to get an honest liv-
ing if I can," said the lad.
The answer pleased Elliott. who wished to
vie with toe other officers, who mostly had
smart looking valets.
"What is y our name ?" he asked.
"John Jones, sir.'
"Were you torn here, my lad?"
"No, sir-I cane from New York."
"Your language and appearance indicate
that you have been in a better situation than
that of a servant ny lad.'
No matter what I have been-I seek no
high position now, sir."
Can   ou r-ad and write ?"
Passably well, sir."
"Do you kr.,w how to dress hair?"
"I can dress my "wo, sir and, if'necessary,
learn to dress yours."
"What wages do you want?"
"I leave that to your own generosity, sir."
"Well, I will take you as a confidential
valet. If yon write a good hand you can act as
my copyist, for I have many orders and let-
ters to copy for his excellency the general. I
believe you can be trusted. You are young,
yet you have an honest countenance. Some.
how it seems as if I had seen you before.'
"I have met 'ou several times in the street,
sir."
"That accounts for it. Well, you can enter
upon your duties at once. I will show you
some letters that require copying} also some
orders."
The youth whom he had thus taken into his
service was slenderand gracefully formed. His
complexion was rather dark, bronzed as if'
from exposure, while in singular contrast with
his dark eyes, his hair, which was curled
thickly down his neck, was red.
For a few days after he had domiciled him-

self under the same roof with Cora Bedford?
Elliott refrained from pressing himself much
into her company, but in a short time his man-
nor became more overbearing and insulting.
Nothing but her threats to appeal to the gene-
ral restrained him from proceedirg to greater
extremities than he did. He had two reasons
for fearing her resort to such a measure
In the first place, the general was an ardent
admirer of beauty, and as heartless a libertine
as himself.  Wit  more power, ae might
snatch the prize 'bich t' lustrul villain co-
veted for himself. Am                   -n, ever eince the fruit
basket expose he dread d to have the general,
upon whom he depended for advancementeand
favor, know anything in regard to his in'r-
gues. Elliett was a iemorseless villain, but
not a hold one. Cowardice went hand in hand
with his treachery in his constitutional char-
acter. He could lie, stealandsssassiate, but
he could not face an open foe.  As a low
cr tninal he could have been a leader-as a  oigh-
wayman, he never would have had the courage
to have robbed a priest.
But though he refrained from actual vi.
lnce for a time, be never for an instant devia-
ted in his intentions, which he could not fully
carry out before the Alderman recovered sif.
ciently to be removed to prison, as he had
originally intended to have him, procuring the
order for his imprisonment by representing to
the general that he was an influential and dan-
gerous rebel.
It need not be wondered, then, that be made
frequent and anxious inqu riea in regard to the
health of the old gentleman, show ig his aix.

Eliza got along under the struntoos of hr
mistress, whih she said "tacitotionst her
stomach" so much, in regard to the tratmhnt
of Corporal Drill and his guard. To give en
insight into that matter, it is only necessary
to describe one scene between them
Drill was seated in a sitting room back of
the parlor, and near him was Eliza. Her face
had anything but a vinegar aspect, and Eliza,
when she looked smiling and pleasant, ws
what might be termed a very pretty girl. Hen

figure was neat and tidy, and knowing such
to be the fact, she did not neglect to dress it
well.        -
On this occasion Drill looked well-decid-
edly comfortable. As usual, he sat as erect in
his chair as he would have stood had he been
on parade-any other position would have
byen uncomfortable to him. in his hand he
held a brimming tumbler of hot ryim-punch-
a concoction for which he had a great partiali-
ty. That it had been mixed by the fair Eliza,
may be inferred from the remarks he made
on the subject.
"Miss Eliza," he said, ripping the punbobat
each pause-" Miss Eliza, I ve marched over
a good deal of ground in my time, and one
thing I've noticed-that is, that there's some
one thing that everybody can do better than
another. Now, as a drill corporal, there isn t
a man that wears a chevron that can bring an
awkward squad forward as well as I can. As
a guide, or to cover a platoon, devil the better
r         man walks than me. But put me in command
of a company, and I couldn't say a word. I'd
double 'em up, give wicy wary orders, and
make a feol of myself."
"What put alithat in your mind, corporal ?"
"This punch, Eliza-it is sweet as your
lips-it sparkles like your eyes-it is as
rich colored as your cheeks-it is a prime
punch! If this war was over, and I had you
for a wife, settled down in snug quarters, and
had money enough to stand at ease with the
world, and could take a punch like this once
in a while and a puff at my pipe, I wouldn't
eaange pta's-wimt Kig George"
"There, you are again talking about having
me for a rife-you know you don't mean it
sorporal."
"On my hoior a  a soldier, I do."
"You-a ove re if you wanted to marry
"Don't I l've the ve'y ground you march
upon? I'd rtther hear one word fromi your
lips than ahalf a dozen of the liveliest marebe
that ever came from fife and drum.'
-"Actions speak more than words," replie
Eliza, pouting. " If you loved me, you would
not like to stand guard over me and my poo
master and mistress. "
"The only reason I like to stay here is be
cause lI'm near you. And hesides, I can b
kinder in my way thtn.some others would be.
"You could be if you would, corporal."
"Wby. Miss Etize, don't I disobey order

and never taee them to the lietenant, as he or

Anoiner day had passed away. The British
general paced to and fco. angrily, in his room.
An officer, spurred, his dress covered with mud,
and hearing the marks of fatigue, stood un-
covered before him.
"You found the enemy on the alert, you
say, drawn up and prepared to receive you?"
""Yes, general, and in advance of the posi-
tion which they held when the reconnoisance
was wade."
"By heaven, there is some traitor in this
camp-ay, I fear me, in my own staff, or close-
ly, too closely, connected with my person
'       My orders were only made known to my staff,
the officers who were detailed for the duty.
Time after time have we thus been foiled. The
enemy gain, by some unknown means,'a fore-
knowledge of every movement we make. Our
foraging parties are cut off, supplies are inter.
cepted, and, instead of being like victors in a
captured city, we are more like a besieged
army. If I can discover the means by which
the enemy are apprised of her movements,
neither age nor sex will deter me from execu-
ting a fearful vengeance on the head of the
offender."
_ "If I might he so bold as to speak, gene-
ral!" said the officer, who waited, and whose
age and scars .ore testimony of long service.
"What would you say, colonel.? Speak out
y--anv advice just now would be of use."
i' would ask your excellency of what
benefit to our cause is the possession of this
place? It is not so good a harbor, nor is it
near so accessible as Baltimore. We are too
near the inaccessible ranges of the Allegha-
nies, whence the hardy ipountaineers and rifle-
men can suddenly issue, sweep away our di.
visions, and then retire beyond our reach.
The country is such that we cannot forage
for subsistence with any degree of sue-
cess or safety-nor can we mnamnuvre a large
force profitably. Their militia and ranging
companies, knowing the ground, and used
from boyhood to following game through the
great forests, the valleys, over rivers and
mountains, have the advantage of our best
veterans."
"True, Colonel. I have already thought of'
evacuating this place, and seeking a more pro.-
fitable field of action. If we could only get
Washington to condense his army, and meet
them at once on a fair field, we could crush
him!"
"If it is done, it must be done in a hurry,

general The French will soon have a large
army here."
"Poh-I care not for the French. They
are like the Hessians, they fight fo ar-but
these Continentals and militia-me' tight for
freedom, for their homes, their wives, and
their little ones, and they fight lar' lto' !
"Yes, general I and my regirmet can tes-
tify to that, to our cost. But if x'ur excel-
lency is done with me, I wil retire
" Do so, colonel-you've been toortcen or
sixteen hours in the saddle--you tost be fa-
tigued."
The officer retired, and the ger'at again
paced to and fro in the room, ap ertly ab-
sorbed in deep study.   His ateuo.iu was
aroused by the entrance of Etliott
"So, sir, the expedition of last iiht was a
failure ?" said the general.-
"I regret that it was, your exceileasy," re-
plied the former.
"And the failure was caused, ev ertlv, by
the enemy receiving information frni some
one in the secret " said the general crutiniz.
ing the young officer closely.
"So it would seem-yet few kne w w f it  I
knew that the orders sent to me wir, i'hivered

"Well, the secret will out yet. ' -healkeep

den," said the youngest, in a low tone, this
companion, after they had gained the street.
"Why, cap'n?'
"You saw that officer?"
"In course I did, sir, and set him down for
one of King George's meanest monkies."
"Well, he is one of the most infernal vil-
lains that the devil ever hatched. I owe him
an old grudge.  I knocked his daylight itet
darkness, the last time we met--and now, be-
fore I leave the city, it'll he ten chances to one
that I send him down to his master, the devil!
His visit to the rascally pirate that keeps the
den, who appears to be an old co-workeS in

deviltry with him, was to arrange for the ab-
duction of the very lacy whom I am now
periling life an4 liberty to see. Thank God, I
learned one thing from his talk---she is here,
and as yet she is safe ! I must manage to see
her-and between you and me, we'll knock
his plans out of shape, and get her away in
safety. If it is true that the British intend
evacuating the city, we will h~ve to work
sharp."
"The sharper the better, cap'n--man and
boy, Jim Taompson's been used "to sharp
work forty years or more
Keeping well in the shade of the houses, al-
though it was dark anywhere, the couple hur-
ried on toward Market street. On arriving at
that streetthey paused before a two-story-and-
a half brick house, of genteel exterior. The
shutters were closed, and no lights visible.
"It is not late," said the youngest; "not
more than nine o'clock--I'll see if I can be
admitted. Be careful not to call me by name
-if we go in, remember we are two poor
seamen, who want a little assistance "
"Ay, ay, sir."
Toe youngest now knocked at the door.
"Who's there? and what do you want?"
asked a gruff voice, as the door was opened,
ant by the hall lamp a man garbed in the uni-
form of a British soldier appeared, holding a
musket with fixed bayonet in his hand.
"Does CaptainJones, of the ship Argo, stop
here ?'" asked the younger, with admirable
presence of mind.
" No-this is a sick rebel's house-one Bed-
ford--and Lieutenant Elliott's quarters," re-
plied the soldier, gruffly.
"We're at the wrong house, then-we're
looking for Cap'n Jones,"-said the other.
"What is the matter? who is there?" asked
a voice from within.
" Onlya couple of men, lookin' for Cap'n
Jones, lieutenant," replied the guard.
"Tell them to go to the devil!''
"Much obliged !" said the first speaker, as
the door was slammed ina'his face.
"What's to be done now, cap'n?  There's
a way around by the alley-only a fence to
climb!   Once in, we can see how the land
lays !"
"No glass bottles broke up on the top of
the fence, nor a big dog in tbe garden, I
hope !" muttered Thompson. "I helped an
officer to run away with a pretty gal, in Lis-
bon, once, and between the glass on the wall,
and the-dog in the garden, I suffered stem and
starn!"
"There is no glass, I'm sure ; they're not
up to that dodge here yet!" said the officer ;
! "probably no dog !"
We will now take a look inside of the house,
and lee what is going on there.

THE MAN-O'-WAR'S-MANS GRUDGE.
CHAPTER XXV.
L oVyE AND DUTY.

"Corporal, is it true that the army is agoin'
to evaporate the city ?" asked Euza, as she
handed him a glass of punch, at about the
hour of nine on the evening already described.
The non-commissioned officer looked at his
glass drained it at a single swallow, and heaved
a sigh that seemed to come up from the very
soles of his brogans.
" Dead, Liza !" he said, with a melancholy
sbake of his head. 'March is the word. I
W istn the cursed war was over. It's hard to
fight with people as speaks the same lingo. If
they Was only French, or Dutch, or Spaniards,
wouldd hie another thing. That punch was
prime. Liza!'
"Ill mix you another, corporal ; I not be
unkind to you, dcar Drill, though you loveyour
duty. as you call it, better than me!"
"-D--n the duty !" said the corporal, with
an ewp' afis that made her start. "If it
wasu t thtt I'd be sure to be caught and shot
for a d. erter, I'd let the service find sone
other corporal in my place ; burn my primin'
if I wouldn't!"
"Dear Corporal Drill, oh! if you only would
help toy maser and mistress to get away from
the hands of that hateful lieutenant, I'd die
for you, almost!" And Eliza threw her white
arms around the corporal a stiff neck with a
fervor that might have choked him had he not
been protected by a leathern stock of the con-
sistency of sheet iron, and kissed him with a
smack that sounded nearly as loud as the re-
port of a small r'istol.
Visions of matrimony, with infantile accom-
panmeints, and especially the two hundred
and seventy pounds, flitted before the dazzled
vision of the bewildered corporal. What he
would have said we know not, for at that crit-
ical moment the girl, whose face was toward
the window, uttered a scream, and, turning as
pale as snow, cried :
'Oh, mercy! I saw it! I saw a ghost! 1b
rose to condemn me '"
'Who? what? Powderand ball ! what is
the matter?' cried tie corporal.
"Oh! oh' I saw the ghost of a sailor man
that I met before you came here this times
-it was looking at me right through the win-
dow
"Ghosts don't look through windows," said
the corporal. "I'll call the guard and look for
the ghost in the garden."
He rushed out oftthe room to do this, and at

the same instant the outer door opened and
Barney and his companion entered       -
"Hide us quietly, my good Eliza, before
that red- coat returns !" said the former.
"Goodness gracious I" is that you, lieuten-
ant? My mistress-"
"Not a word now, Eliza, not a word, but
hide us. and when he return get him out of
the way as soon as you can. Then you can
let your mistress know I am here," cried Bar-
ney.
"Quick, then-get into that cupboard, both
of you, and make no noise." said the girl, com-
prehending the ghost part now, as she saw the
honest faces of the seamen bent upon her.
'"Now be careful not to touch the crocker-
ary I" added the girl, as she closed the small
closet door on them, just in time, for before
she could regain her feat, the corporal re-en-
tered the room, attended by four of his men,
and hurried out into'the yard to look for the
ghost.
Of course he sought in vain, and found not
even a sign of a living being, much less a
ghost, if ghosts do leave signs.
"I think it must 'ave been a fat ey of yours,
Mies 'Liza," said the corporal. "I don't be-
lieve in ghosts, but I thought some chap might
'ave been in the the yard lookm' in at us-but
there's never a feather of one there."
"Maybe it was a fancy," said Eliza; "I feel
nervous and highetrikey to-night. I guess I'd
better go to bed ; we can talk to morrow, you
know, dear corporal."
"Yes, 'Liza, if tramp is not the word ; but
there's no knowin' but what orders may come
for us to move in the morning. and if they do,
Il have to go with my company, and loss
yours, without my master tapes you along with
your lady, for her he has sworn to take. I
heard him do it when he was talking to himself
in his room to-night."
"You did? Oh, the horrid beast! I'd tear
his eyes out for five pins. But I won't go
with him, that's flat."
"But with me, dear 'Liza !" and the cor-
poral put on an excruciatingly affectionate
look.
No, nor with you, nor any other red-
coat that lives, as long as there's a true
Americas blue jacket alive I" she said, raising
her voice a very little, for wtat purpose a
good judge of woman's character can easily
determine.

CHAPTER XXVI.

A FIEND IN HUNAN SHAPE.

Immediately after leaving the commanding
general, as described in the twenty-third chap-
ter, Elliott repaired to his quarters, and after
writing off a single copy of the general order
which he had just received, to summon the
regimental officers to a council called his vol
unteer valet to his side, and bade hint tran-
cribe the necessary number of copies, and
take them to the officers whom he named
"And is it true, then, that the argry is to
evacuate ithe city, sir ?" asked the young valet.
"It is talked of; curse the idea 1" said te
officer.
You sec in much attached to the city, sir,'
said t tevalet.
"Not to the city, but to some one in it, and
whom I must get ort of it if we leave. You
seem to b- a lad of ready wit, I wonder the t
you have nit discovered my secret crc tbia
If by tihe secret, sir, you ro an your pa;
aion for the lidy under this roof,it is io secret
to me, nor ht r aversion to you  Both I have
already served ; but a still tongue hetolkens
a sentile head, and keep my own counsels.'
"Then, as you are so observing, and to dis-
creet withal, know you not of a plan by which,
if we move, I can transport her to New York
unbeknown to the cilicers, and get her even
more n my power than she now is?"
"It is for 3ou to plan, sir; I am only your
servant, ready to obey orders.'
Tbe valet spoke calmly and meekly, yet bad
Eliott been a good judge ofthumaui nat ore, his
suspicions must have been aroused by the
manner in which the youth evidently sough
to learn his plans.
"I have forced a plan, my good Jones, and
I shall need some one to see it faithfully exe-
cuted. You have been ready and faithfu), so
far, in my service, and to you I think I can
entrust the delicate mission."
"Am I too bold, sir, if I ask the plan you
propose ? '
" No ; it is necessary that you should know
it. I have determined to remove her to a small

vessel . hick I shall charter, and send it
around to New York either before us or ac-
companying the transport vessels. The ab-
ducti;n from this house will occur in my ab-
sence, and be so conducted that I shall appear
to have nothing to ao with it."
"But whom can you trust, sir? Not your
drunken corporal and'his guard."
l oy n means. I have a trusty fellow, one
Tow Rifey, engaged, who has done many an
odd job for me, and he will get good men to
aid him. All that I wish you to do is to super-
%ise toe matter, and then to accompany him
to see that no harm befalls her, for among such
a rough set there is no knowing what might
be dr e."
IHol Eiliott seen the lah which darkened
the ceek, and the shuddet which shook the
for u. of the  outh, when Riley's name was
menirned, 1e might have suspected danger,
but he did not.
" Wnat think you of the plan, Jones?" he
cowinied.
-' If Exertet as wtaiell as it is laid, sir, it can-.
not fitl; but I must hasten with these orders."
"True, my lad, and I will spend an hour
with the fair Cora. It is a pleasure for me to
tease Oer; the day is not far distant when I
will bumble her rebel pride ; when on her
bended knees she will sue to be my wife.
hasten with the orders, Jones, and be secret."
Certainly, air ; as recret as the grave," and
the va'et at once commenced his duties.
ELbiott now entered the parlor of the man
sion. No one seemed to be in it; for though
dimly lighted, his eye could scan every part
of it.        *
"With herrebel father, I suppose, as usual,"
be muttered. " If she is not in soon I will ring
for her impudent maid, and send for her."
So saying, he cast himself down upon the
old fashioned sofa. Hardly had he touched it,
when a grunt so loud and unearthly came from
underneath it, that he bounded at a singleleap
to the centre of the floor. He was speechless

moment a black head with two great protrud-
ing eyes stuck out from beneath the sofa, like
the head of a ninety year old snapping turtle
emerging from its bell.
 "The devil !" muttered Elliott.
"Ki Massa, you a-most sqush ole nigger !"
said a voice issuing from the head, and then
the misshapen form of old Cato dragged itself
into light.
S"W hat were you doingunder thatsofa, you

"I creep in dere, massa, for try catch um

into Mr. Bedford's room and tell Miss Cora
that I wish to see her on special business, and
then crawl off your ugly careassinto the entry,
and sleep on the mat if you want to."
"Yes, massa, Ki, you a'most squash ole
nigger dat time."
In a short time after the negro left, Miss Bed-
ford entered. Etuott a-ose and proffered a
seat, wbich, with a gesture of calm dignity,
she refused
"You sent me word that you wished to see
me on business, sir. Business matters require
but fe w wo t3s " -
"Yet, fair Cora, mine requires many ; nay,
turn not away, this may be the last conversa-
tion that we shall ever have in this city."
If I thought such would be the case, I
should listen to the last conversation with
pleasure." replied the spirit ed gill.
"It probably will be. Our army is about to
evacuate the city."
"It is? Then our hole Washington is ap-
proaching. He yet will conquer."
"Perhaps; but now, Miss Bedford, you will
sit down and converse with me for a little
while, will you not ?'
" Yes ; but ,I hope that on this occasion you
will forbear your usual insults, and endeavor
to act the man, if not the gentleman.-I would
not be sounreasonableas to ask you to attempt
the latter character," continued the lady, as
she took a chair at come distance from the
sofa.
"Ever cruel, ever satirical, beautiful Cora,'
said the uilicer, trying to assume a calm and
gentle tone, w  ich his every look belied.
"You had better proceed with your busi-
ness, and forbear your disgusting and fulsom
flatteries, w bich come to me like the exhala

"To win you I would do anytfdg, say,

"No, you poor poltroon, no! One is weaker

"Will you give me your reasons for this

"Yes. First, you are a coward-an imita-

He arose, bent his mouth to her ear, and, in
a whisper, hissed the word wbich lie scarce

Among the British forces, the next day, im-
portant preparations were made for some se-
rious movement. Althoughthe orders had been
kept studiously secret, yet in some manner the
rumor had gone abroad that the city was to
be evacuated. There was gladness on the faces
of many of the citizens, which they scarcely
made an attempt to conceal, while others-
rank tories at heart-looked sad and distrustful,
for they knew that the departure of the Brit-
ish army, and the re-occupation of the city by
the Americans, would bring them no good.
Another class felt even more sadly-the liquor
dealers and the panderers to licentious vices
and pleasures, who ever hang like' jackals
about an army when it is at rest-for they
knew that the well fed, well clad, and well paid
ritish army,.would be replaced by an army
.  bich, though patriotie,had neither leisure for
ilulgence,nor moneys to dissipate. Never be-
tre. since nations have held a right to be con-
fidered civilized, has a war been carried on
y  iti les financial assistance than was our Revo-
lution. Officers served not only without pay,
but beggared themselves to clothe and feed
their troops. With bare, feet, unmurmuring
troops marched over frozen clods and icy
ground, leaving their own blood upon the trail.
' Men who had not a blanket to rest upon at
night, nor a tent to shelter them from wind
and rain, still struggled on, hoping to free their
country from the thraldom- of tyranny. And
through indomitable energy, unwavering per-
severance, and a patriotism which no danger
could appal, no reverses discourage, by the
aid of Almighty God, they succeeded. We
became a nation among nations-a star of
liberty in a sky once darkened with the rain-
cloud of oppression. And how have we-their
descendants-repaid those noble men for their
sacrifices? Go look at the squabbles of our
leaders in the Senate chamber and in the Con-
gressional halls! Go look at the leaders, for-
getting country and party ; and even party and
self. only workingto fill their coffers with spoils
from the people, and not for the public honor
or good-for a reply ! Go ask for the graves
of your Revolutionary sires ! they are un-
marked-even the memory of their deeds is
passing away ! Alas! that such things should be
but they are!

It was noon. Riley, the landlord, had an
interview with Elliott, whose plans were laid
for the abduction to take place at midnight
on that night. The latter had chartered a
small, swift-sailing vessel, leaving the manning
of her entirely to Riley, as well as the manage-
ment, only providing that hisvalet, John Jones,
was to take charge of the lady, and attend to
her wants and her disposal on the arrival of
the vessel. Riley, glad to get a crew on such
easy terms, had accepted the services of tae
disguised Barney, and seven of his asso-
ciates, who had already been on board of
their new craft, and seen that she was prepar-
ed for sea.
She was a very pretty schooner, built very
sharp, for those days, though not exactly v hat
would be termed a clipper at this time. She
was built for sailing in shoal water, but had
very nice accommodations, having been the
yacht of Mr. Robert Morris, the~ financial
savior of his country. Barney saw at a
glance that, bad she been a little Heavier-she
was only about forty tons' measurement-she
would have made an invaluable cruiser for the
bay and river,-if well manned. She had been
seized and confiscated by the British when the
city was taken. She had been named "The
Mary" by the original owner, after bis beau-
tiful and amiable bride, who had been Miss
Mary White, the belle of the city.
Attached to the vessel was a swift-rowing
gig. Barney had managed to have a good
supply of arms and/ammunition concealed on
board, and his men, beside, had armsconcealed
on their persons.
During the day he managed to exchange
signals, unobserved, with his lady love; and,
though their hearts trembled with anxiety,
they felt confident of success. Each party
deemed their plans perfect, and such as could
not be overthrown.
As night drew on, it was generally rumored
that, guarded by the men.of-war and strong
flanking columns, the transports would move
down the river on the morrow, and the city be
evacuated.
Evening, with its darkening shadows, came
on, and came early, for a storm was setting
in. Although it was June, a cold northeast
wind swept in with heavy clouds, and every-

thing looked chill and gloomy. Barney,
however, was pleased with the aspect of the
weather; it wounO render his movements more
easy, his digun-e more safe, and, with the
wind as it was, he could lay up the river with
the wind, close hauled, or scud down it if he
wished.

fond seamen were of grog, and not knowing
his customers, thought it a matter of wisdom
to keep them where they would not be tempt-
ed to indulge to excess before he needed them
for action.
"It's going to be a nasty night, sir," said
Barney to in, as they looked out from the
door of the old tavern.
"Yes, but all the better for us," said Riley.
"If the gel should tate it into her head to

schooner, we'll run down the river under

such a breeze, as if the devil had kicked us on
end!"
"Isn't it nearly time we went on board, to
get the men ready, sir ?"
-  No, not for two hours yet," said the land-
lord, glancing at a huge bull's-eye which he
drew frota his wateh-fob; then, squinting to'
windward with his one eye, he uttered : ""It-ll
blow a snorter to-night. I reckon a couple of
horns won't set us back for the night's work,
my lad."
Suiting the action to the word, the landlord
mixed a couple of stiffeners of grog for himself
and Barney, and then lighted his pipe. His
substitute behind the bar was like himself in
one respect, and singular in all others. He
had lost an eye, aleo a leg and arm, and went
under the name of " One-sided Jack," Like
most men who have been deprived of a portion.
of their limbs, he was unusually active with
what had been left to him., He had been a
kind of useful pensioner to Riley, and took
charge of matters for him at all times when the
latter was called from hia post by inclination
or business.

It wa sea-y on the metig of thiasday,-when,

from  his bld, called for the corporal of the
guard to re'-iv. hii usual report. Cato, whom
he had sent fir tiat purpose, soon returned,

said:

In a shirt time one of the other soldiers
made his appearance.
"Woere i. Corporal Drill? Why is he ab-
sent from his post ?"
I do not know, sir," replied the soldier,
saluting.  'It- hs not been even since ten or

" No, lieutenant. At about the time I name,
he came out of the room where he had been
sitting with her, and called four of us to
go into the yard with him to see if any one
was there. The woman had been frightened,
he said, by what she thought was the ghost
of a sailor looking in at the window. He
thought there was some one in the yard, but
there was no one, nor any sign of any one.
We looked carefully. He should have relieved
guard at midnight, but he did not, and the-
sentinel called his relief himself. The cor-
poral has not been to his bed during the
night."
'Why did you not tell me of this earlier ?"
"Because we were in' hopes the corporal
would return before you were up, sir. He is
always very regular."

It can hardly be that he has deserted,"
muttered Elliott. thoughtfully. "Have you
asked the waivng maid anout him?"
"Yes; sir; she says he left her right away
after we searched the yard."
"S e may know where he went to; send
her to me, and wine she is here, search her
room. A man makes a fool of himself when
he is in love wili a woman, sometimes.''
The solier saluted again, and departed to
obey his orders.
"Strage !" muttered Elliort, as he paced to
and fro in the room. " I cannot thin that
Drill nas deserted, but that woman may have
induced him to do it. I will soon learn "
In a few moments Etiza entered the room.
Her face was as demure as that of s country
maiden in church when she hears her banns

"Did the lieutenant instruct the soldier to
say that I was wanted i" she asked.
" "He did. Wnat story is this about a ghost
that I bear?' demanded Elliott, fixing his
eyes keenly upon tier, to read, if possible, any
change in her countenance.
"On, the ghost. Well, sir, I don't hardly

that it was a phantaswy of the imagination.

"The Lord only knows, sir. He oniysopped

"Did you go aone-eh, my fair wench ?"

"I mean that I wish a reply to my question

CHAPTER XXXII.
THE ABDUCTION.

It was eleven o'clock. The storm raged
wildly-whistling through the streets and al-
leys of the town, or through the rigging of
the vessels at the wharves, almost winterishly.
The "all's well" of the sentinels, as they
paced their weary rounds, muffled up in their
thick watch coats, could scarcely be heard
from post to post. Here and there a light
could be seen in the town, but most of the
houses had been darkened, for on such a
dreary night people seldom love to keep late
hours
At this hour, a boat, rowed by six men, with
a seventh sitting in the stern sheets, to steer
her, pushed from the side of a schooner an-
chored close over by the island, opposite Market
street, and pulled in for the wharf. Upon en-
tering the dock, and reaching the landing, four
of the men who rere in the boat followed him
who was in the stern sheets, and sprang on the
wharf. The other two were directed to remain
with the boat.j
As soon as they landed, Riley, for he was
the leader, gatheredthe men, and, in a whisper,
gave his final directions. It had been settled
that Elliott should, if Miss Bedford had re-
tired to her room-which Barney knew she
would do, for he had so arranged it with her
as to meet all of Elliott's plans-that he was
to show a single light from a northern window
in the house. Upon the party entering the
house, the sentinel, who was also under in-
structions, was, without noise or resistance, to
suffer himself to be seized, gagged, and bound.
They were then to hasten to the apartment of
the lady, muffle her up in her clothing, if she
had reired, hasten with her to the boat, and
carry her on board the vessel. Elliott was not
to be seen, or appear to know anything of the

affair, nor was his valet, until he joined the
party on board the schooner.
All this was now fully explained to the
men, who had, of course, already received their
orders from Barney, after which, Riley, giving
each man a drink of grog from a huge pocket
flask which he carried in his pocket, moved
onward. Their steps were slow and stealthy
-not a man of the party spoke above his
breath.
On this occasion, the front door of the house
was left unlocked, and everything "worked to
a charm." Scarcely any noise was made in
securing the sentinel, and then, headed by Ri-
ley, Barney and one other, hastenod to the
apartment of the lady.
Barney had expected to find her up and
ready to be willingly abducted. What was
his astonishment, however, to find her sleeping
so soundly that the noise of their entrance did
not awaken her,
"I reckon the lieutenant has drugged her
on purpose, so that she'll make no bother for
us," suggested Riley, as he reached out to
take her in his arms.
Here, let me carry her, I am the strongest
of the party," said Barney, as without a glance
himself, or without permitting the others to
look upon the form of her whom he loved, he
quickly wrapped the quilt and sheets around
her, and raised her tenderly, as if she were a
babe, in his powerful arms. He took occasion
to whisper, to her whom he supposed to be
simulating asleep, "Fear not, my angel."
"Are we not to take the old gentleman
along, too," asked Barney.r.
"No-we're not to bother with him," said
Riley. "Hurry off-the girl is all that I'm
to be paid for."

THE MAN-O'-WAR'a
Barney would have insisted upon taking her
father, but he dared not risk theething, and he
knew that Elliott would not dare to harm him
after Cora was gone, so he hurried out with
his fair burden-hastening all the faster, as a
singular noise betokened that the house was
*      alarmed. As he passed from the door, he saw
rushing, or rather staggering into the entry,
Corporal Drill, so pale, and covered with ashes,
that he looked more like a drunken miller,
than a soldier in his Britannic Majesty's ser-
vice.
There was no time for a second glance. The
lungs of the corporal were in full play, and
the party rushed for the boat, Jim Thompson
very carefully and considerately, helping Bar-
ney with his burden.
In a few minutes, the party were at the boat.
"Pass her down to the stern sheets-all's
safe now," said Riley, gleefully.
"Let me handle her, I'll do it gently, sir,
so as not to weaken her," said Barney, stepping
carefully into the boat, and drawing the cloth-
ing more carefully around her form, to keep
the chill wind and spray from her.
"All right-but you're uncommon careful
of property that's nothing to you," muttered
Riley.
"She's a woman, and were she to wake in
terror, and commence screaming, it might give
us trouble yet," said Barney, who almost itched
to tell the heartless wretch how dearly he
prized the 'property" which he held in his
arms.
"Shove off. It's deuced strange the lieu-
tenant's valet isn't here-but I'm not going to
wait for him"
"Hole on dah, Massa Riley, please, jest one
minnit, for ole nigger," said a grum voice,
speaking as if its utterer had been on a run-
- "Massa Elliott, he sen' ole nigger to wait on
lady, and said he couldn't spare Massa Jones
jest yet."
"Why, it's Elliott's crooked nigger, a pretty
looking thing to wait on a lady, butI suppose
its all right. Tumble into the bows there,
Ebony-Knot."
"Yes, massa! Ki, massa, you come so fast,
it make ole nigger sweat."
"Yes-I can tell that easy, by the wind,"

said the landlord, as the boat moved out from
the pier.
In a few moments they were alongside the
sohooner, and Barney, who from the start had
not let the lady pass from his arms, stepped on
board, and carried the lady carefully down into
the state-room which had been prepared for
her. . Laying her carefully on the bed, he re-
turned to the vessel's deck. He had no op-
portunity to speak tp her, for Riley was at
his side or heels all the time.
"So far, sogood," said Riley, as they all
stood on the deck. "Now we'll take a nipper
all around, and then we'll get under way"
To this Barney made no objection, and as he
did not, of course the crew assented. Who
ever knew a sailor to refuse a glass of grog?.,
Inthose days, too, everybody took their today,
from the king to the peasant, from the parson
to the grave-digger. It was only a matter of
economy, then, twat made Franklina temper-
ance man. Don't think, however, cold-water-
istical reader, that I mean disrespect to the
temperance cause ; no, indeed-by the thin
shadow of John Chambers I vow I do not.
After a hearty "nip" had been taben all
around, the sails, or at least all she could bear,
a double-reefed mainsail, foresail and jib, with
the bonnets off, were loosed, and the anchor
as noiselessly as possible. In less time almost
than it takes for me to describe it, the vessel
was moving down the river. It had been Bar-
ney's intention to take charge of her at once,
and go up the river, so as to reach his own
vessel, and the sooner get within the Aneri-
can lines, but the wind had veered more to
the northward, and blew so freshly, that he
abandoned the design, and made up his mind
to run down the river, and hide away in a
creek or river until the city was evacuated,
and the British had left the waters of the
Delaware.
The river in front of the city, and for some
distance below, was quite thickly filled with
vessels, but as lights were hoisted on board,
it was easy to avoid them, and they swept on
without being hailed'   Had they been, it
would not have mattered, for Riley had the
pass word. We will now leave them, and re-
turn to the city for a while.

their own ease to add tothe comfort or others,
so pious, without always shoving a Bible or

Reader, really I beg pardon for writing so
much about woman nature, a master in which
I have so little experience. But the subse-
quert matter of this enapter will show you
what set me into the train of thought which
elicited the above.
During the entire day after the morning's
interview with Elliott; Eliza had found her-
self so closely watched that she had no oppor-
tunity to go down into the cellar to see how
the prisoner in the ash-hole got along. Of
course she knew that, so tightly bound and
gagged, he must suffer, but angered and an-
noyed as she was, perhaps she didn't care.
Sne supposed he was safe, and as she never
had cared tor him particularly in her heart,
it is not to be supposed that thoughts of his
sufferings lay very heavy in her bosom. She
was occupied, too, in making, all as carefully
as she could, without attracting notice, prepa-
rations for the intended es.'ape of her mistress,
of wnieh she was fully informed. She wished
much to accompany her lady, but this had
been canvassed and thought improper, as it
would not tally with the rest of the plan. It
had been ordered, to make things work better,
that she should retire early, so as not to ap-'

Pausini for a moment to recover the use of
them, and for the pain to subside, he planned
his future actions. Putting his hand in a
pocket, lie drew forth a small knife, and with
its aid he soon had the gag out of his mouth,
and his feet were free.
"Curse her-I'll fix her off for the trick, the
false-hearted jade, as sure as I'm a corporal!
As for her blue-jacket-lover, ramrods and
wadding ! only just let me citch him once !'
He now attempted to rise, but at first he
could not stand. After resting a little while,
and permitting circulation to resume its course,
he was able to get up, and taking the light, he
staggered up stairs. His first visit was to the
closet where Eliza kept the rum bottle. A
hearty swig at this soon made him a little
more elastic, but he could hardly navigate,
when he put the candle down asd went to
visit the guard. As he opened the door which
led into the entry, he saw that it was filled
wi h eF-e-nen, recognised Et' i's blue jacket
lover, and saw that one had a female in his
arn .
' Treason! Robbery! Guard, turn out!"
he shouted.
His cries aroused the whole house, and in a
few moments all the soldiers were standing
around him, looking at his singular figure, and
asking where he came from, and what was the
matter.
At the same moment another person from
outside was added to the group. It was none
other than Elliott, who, having seen the party
of seamen issuing with their prize from the
house, supposed that all was right, and now
advanced to inquire into the cause of the up-
roar, which he supposed he could unfathom
more readily than any one there.
Where have you been, sir? Drunk as
usual ?" he asked, with difficulty restraining a
laugh ac he looked at the extraordinary figure
of the corporal.
"Not drunk, sir !" cried the corporal, bring
ing his hanl up to a salute, with a jerk which
threw a:thes into the eyes of his nearest neigh-
bars ; " not drunk, sir, but most damnably
abused! '
'What is the meaning of this uproar?'
"Why. sir, after I escaped from my confine-
ment in the ash hole, I saw as I came to alarm
the guard. a party of soldiers here in the entry,
and they were carrying off a lady-Miss Bed-
ford, I suppose-and I, as in duty bound,

tenant, with assumed carelessness ; but ere he
had finished what he intended to say, a change
came over the spiritof his dream, and a shadow
fell upon "the light of his countenance." This
was occasioned by the appearance of an addi-
tion to the group in the shape of Miss Cora
Bedford and her maid Eliza, who, with can-
dles in their hands, and fully dressed, came
out from the direction of their rooms.
"What means this mummery? Are you en-
joying a masquerade?" asked Cora, of Elliott,
who gazed upon her as if he could hardly be-

him.

by the arpearauce of matters, although both
her and Eliza knew why Corporal Drill looked
as he did, though neither could account for his
release.
What Elliott thought could not at that mo-
ment be ascertained, for a mounted ordely rode
up to the door and cried:
" lieutenant Elliott is wanted at headquar-
ters instantly."
Toe imperative order, as well as the tone in
which it was given by the mounted orderly,
showed Elliott that an instant obedience was
required.
" You wilt oblidge me, Miss Bedford, by re-
turning to your room. Corporal Drill, you
will clean yourself and prepare to give an ac-
count of yourself. on my return. In the mean-
time, the whole guard will keep watch, and by
no means suffer any person either to enter or
leave the house during my absence."
Having given these orders rapidly, and in a
tone of impatience, he turned off and hastened

CHAPTER XXXIV.
THE DISCLOSURE.

Eleven was an eventful hour on that night.
The British General had spent the evening in
examining maps and charts, and preparing for
the movement determined for the next day. A
large number of transports and vessels of war
were ready to move and guard the troops ansd
munitions and stores, which the general
wished to do before a French squadron, even
then expected off the coast, could arrive with
additional men and arms for Washington. He
knew well that when the Americans were
strengthened by such an additional force, his
position, hemmed in in Philadelphia, and
blockaded by a squadron in the bay, or his re-
treat by water cut off, would be anything but
pleasant. And he knew the necessity of cele-.
rity in his movements.
Several members of his staff were with him,,
and various orders had been despatched during
the evening ; also several messages from dif
ferent .commands had been received.  The
general was about to dismiss his officers, and
retire to rest, when an officer, covered witti
dust, and evidently fatigued with rapid riding,
came in, and hardly using the ceremony to sa-
lute the general, banded him an open despatch.
The general s brow contracted as his eye
glanced over it, and his face, which first as-
sumed a look of surprise and astonishment,
reddened into'anger.
"George Washington never sleeps!" he mut-
tered. Then turning to the officer who had
borne the despatch, he asked :
"When did the heavy artillery move, of
which this note speaks ?''
"It commenced to move, we have learned
by an escaped prisoner, before daltght, sir."
"And this cespatch says that the enemy,
gathering in their light troops and outposts,
are moving toward the city."
"it is correct, sir !"
" When did they commence this move-
ment ?"
"Also at daylight, sir."
"Had they been previously making any pre-
parations, as if intending to attack us here ?'
"None, general."
"Then, by Heaven, Washington has been
informed of our intention to evacuate the city.
That heavy artillery has been moved so rapid-
ly, that is may be used on the river below, to
annoy our retreat, and he has advanced so that
he can enter the city in triumph, the moment
we leave it. Our whole plan of operations
must be changed. We must march through

New Jersey. But how could the news of my
intended movement have reached him? In no
way but by treason ! Where," he exclaimed,
angrily, as he turned toward his staff, "where
is Lieutenant Elliott ?"
"Gone to his quarters, general," replied
the officer.
"Despktch an orderly for him instantly, and
gallop to the officers of division and counter-
mand the marching and embarkation orders.
We will not move to-morrow !"
Pacing to and fro, chafing like an angry lion
in his den, Elliott found the general when he
arrived.
"So, sir !" cried the latter, "matters of im-
portance entrusted to your care, have again
reached the quarters of the enemy, even as
soon as they were divulged to our own
troops."
"I do not understaud you, general !  Surely
you do not mean that I am at fault '
' Did I not entrust  you tie ordering to-
gether of the Council o Officers?'
"You did, sir, and 1  t ey ed it. Whatever
the decision of your cou cil was, I know not--
all orders that came to me catae sealed, and
were so delivered,"
"Did you deliver them all in person ?"
"No, general. My servant. John Jones, a
very faithful and confidential young man, de-
livered a portion of them."
"Ah--he did! Where ,is he now ?'
"At my quarters, sir; if you wish, I will
order him to come into your presence."
"Stay here, sir--I 'will seni for him. Let
an orderly be despatched for this John Joi es,
at once."
Eliott felt the anger of the general very se-
verely, yet still more did be regret the mis
carriage of his attempted abduction of Cora
Bedford, for which he could in no manner ac-
count. He had seen the seamen leave the
house--a female was borne away by them To
this, both- his eyes and those of the corporal
testified. Who could she have been ? how
could Riley, ever before-so artistic and careful
in carrying out his plots of villany, be de-
ceived?
/ In a short time the orderly seat for Jones
returned with the information. that the valet
could not be found. Re, however, handed a
letter to Elliott, saying :
"Your corporal, sir, told inc that this letter,
directed to you,, air, was found on the young
man's table."

CHAPTER XXXV.
THE SURPRISE AND CAPTURE.

I suppose the reader would like to take a
glance at "The Mary" and her crew. Well,
come aboard
As the .reader is aware, it was about the
mid hour of the night when sail was made
upon the gallant little craft. The wind blew
so fresh, and, as it generally is in the river,
blew so freshly withal, that the few hands had
to keep on deck during the night. Although
Barney knew the channel full as well, and
probably better, than Riley, the latter was
not aware of the fact, and.-consequently kept
his station aft by the helmsman, giving his
orders, and frequently taking a drop of comfort
from his capacious rum flask. When the gray
dawn of the morning came fogily out from
the caverns of night, the schooner bias well
down the river, but the wind was dying away,
and when the sun rose it bid fair to go down
altogether. Barney did not regret this much,
for hie was near the creek in which he intend-
ed to, secrete the schooner, but he regretted
more that a British frigate lav at anchor not
more than three or four miles below them,
and altogether too' near the creek to please
him.
Ae ihe schooner's sails began to flap i the
wind idly, and the wind to decrease, Riley
took another pull at his flask, and offered it
to Ba -iey, who was steering. The latter did
not refuse the proflered beverage..
"I reckon I'll go below and see how the
gal go's along. It's strange she hasn't made
any moise. Harry must have drugged her
heavy. He's a known' one for that; he had
a gal at my house once that slept three days
afore nhe knowed where she was, or what had
come of her."
"The villain " muttered Barney.
"Oh, he paid well-I'll always say that
of him," said Riley, starting to go into the
cabin.
"Stop !" said Barney, suddenly stepping be-
fore hi in, and beckoning to Jim Thompson to
take tie helm.
"W ny, what's up!" said Riley, angrily, at-
tempt'nrg to pass on.
" I mean," said Barney, giving him a shove
that ,sent him reeling against the taifrail,
"that I am master here, and that if you at-
tempt to enter that eahin without my permis-i
sion, I u pitch you overboard. I owe you-a
grudge for being employed by such a dirty
villain in such dirty work, but out of regard
to soma of your kind ways, if you'll behave

yourself, you shall have all the grub and grog
you want, and when I get ready I'll put you
ashore, or land you in Philadelphia after the
British have left."
"You're mighty considerate for a foremast
hand, you are" said Riley, in astonishment.
"Who the hell are you ?"
"Lieutenant Barney, of the Continental ser-
vice, at your command, Mr. Tom Riley, and
this is the flag that I sail under." said Barney,
drawing out a small American flag from his bo-
som; "and as soon as we're out of sight
of that cursed frigate, yonder, I intend to host
it on this my lawful prize. The crew all be-
long to my own good craft, the Sachem."
"Regularly taken in and done for," groaned
Riley. "Five hundred pounds gone- to the
devil! Who'd have thought Tom Riley was
such a d--d half-witted fool as to be done
this way ?"
The c edcvant landlord sat down on the edge
of the transom, and, heaving a deep sign, toou
a very long pull at his rum flask, then looked
at the frigate, looming up with her black sides
and   avy spars in ,e distance.
"Ii you'll pro 'se to take things easy,
make no signals, and behave .yourself lice a
man, I'll not confine you," said Barney ;
obtaIrwiseit will be necessary for me to put you
out of the way of troubling, or bringing
trouble upon me"
"I can't do nothin' but promise," said Riley,
sulkily. "You've got me,,and I can't help
myself," as the-rat said to the trap."
"And now," said Barney, "I11 go below
and see how the lady ic-perhaps she'd rather
see me than you. You brought her clothes
along, did you not, Thompson ?"
"If you mean them are things as you tossed
me from the chair, when you picked me up,
sir, they're in the state-room-I hove 'em in
there when you laid her'down."
"Then, if she has awakened from her stu-
por, she can dress," said Iarney, as he de-
scended into the cabin...
The negro Cato lay coiled up in front of the
state-room door, so close that it could not be
opened without arousing him wereehe asleep.
But this was not the case, for he half rose up
as Barney approached.
"Is the lady awake yet?" asked the officer.
"Me jest hear um stir, sah," said the negro.
Barney knocked against the door gently.
"I will make my appearance in a moment,"
said a voice from within.


70             THE MAN-O'-WAR S-MAN'S GRUDGE.

Barney started at the sound. It was a lady's
voice, but to his ear it did not sound like the
well  inemembered  tones of Miss Bedford.
Whatever his doubts were, they were speedily
solved by the appearance of the lady, who to
him was an utter stranger.
'You are not Mess Bedford!" he said, in
surprise.
"No, rir !'" she said, in a haughty tone, "and
you may tell y our master that Miss Bedford is
safe from his power."
"My master, madam? I own no master but
the Comnander.in chief of the forces of the
United States, trom w hom I hold my commis-
sion."            ,
What, sir ! Are you not a tool of Henr
Elliott s, employed to abduct Miss Bedford?"
"I am ro tool of hie, though I supposed
that 1 was rescuing Miss Bedford from his
power. I am her dearest friend. If she were
here she would be safe. But, my God, where
is she now ?"
"Safe, sir-fear notfor her. I left her lock-
ed up in a room in her lather's house, and not
knowing that she had a friend near him to foil
him in his infamous designs, I took her place,
and suffered myself to be abducted without
resistance, for I fear him not. He would rather
meet the foul fiend himself than to face Caro-
line Ormsley, for I have sworn to effect his
ruin, and I will accomplish my oath. Fear
not for your friend Miss Bedford. Elliott is,
probably, moving with the troops long before
this time, supposir'g that his scheme of ab-
duction has succeeded, and that he will find
his intended victim in New York. I had in-
tended to meet him there, and let him sup-
pose, till the last moment, that I was Mies
Bedford. But now you will sooner meet the
lady if you change your course. I can reach
New York ea-ily, and, under another guise,
carry out my intentions, for never will I rest
while he lives."
"Lady. I thank you sincerely for your no-
ble act and generous intentions, and Cora her-
self will thank you. While you are on board
this vessel, eveiy wish of yours shall be grati-
fied. I regret there is no female servant on
board to wait upon you."
"I have no need of any," she said, with a'
sad smile. "That faithful slave has been my
only servant for a long time," she added, as
she pointed to Cato, who showed at least a
six inch double row of ivory as he looked up
at her.
" Cap'n. I've an idea you'd better come on
deck," said Thompson, from above ; "we're
driftin' down to'rds the frigate uncomfortable
fast, and a boat is shoving' off from her:"
"Excuse me, lady," said Barney, bowing ;
"I must attend to my duty. Have no fears for
your safety, but for the present, please remain
below."
"I will do as you wish, sir," she replied, as
he hastened on deck.

When he got the-e, he found. as Thompseoi
said, that the schooner was. drifring "nncom-
fortable" near to the frigate. Tae wind had
died away, and a strong ebb tide was running
out  Tnu schooner was in easy gun shot of
the frigate, and nearing her every moment.
Beside, a boat had left her, and was pulling
toward the schooner.
Barney ins antly ordered thc sails lowered
and the anchor to be let go.  He then caused
the English flag to be hoisted at the usual
place, on the main topping lift.
Then turning to Riley, who sat looking at
the approaching boat with undisguised pleas-
ure, he asked :
"Have you any particular fondness for a
sudden death, Mr. Riley ?"
"Can't say that I have-'specially jest now,
when the prospect of them five hundred
pounds is se much better than it was a little
while ago," said Riley, with a sudden grin.
"Your prospect of short shrift and a sud-
den death is a great deal better," said Barney,
showing the butt of a pistol, and looking him
firmly in the eye.
"God ! Why, man, you would'nt murder
me ?"
"Listen to me, Tom Riley. I'am a man
who never lied-neither to my worst foe nor
my best friend. So help me God, if you diso-
bey me in one particular, I will blow your
brains out the moment you do it. Take com-
mend of this vessel now, as if we were all
Englishmen, and still your crew, as you sup-
posed when we started. When that boat
comes alongside, show the officer your pass,
and tell him your business, just as you would
have done, had nothing happened. If you
do that, you as well as ourselves are safe; if
you do not, you are a dead man."
"I'll do it," said Riley, turning a little pale,
for he saw death in Barney's eye-and then he
took a good long pull at his flask, to strength-
en his nerves.
In a few moments the boat was alongside.
Riley stood aft, assuming all the importance
of a skipper, while Barney was sufficiently
near to fulfil his threat if he saw the least
sign of treachery on his part.
"What vessel is this, and where bound P"
asked the English lieutenant, as he stepped on
board.
"The private schooner Mary, Captain Tom
Riley, of Philadelphia, with property of Lieut.
Elliott, aid to Gen. Howe, on board-also the
lieutenant's wife," said Riley, quite pompous-
ly.
"H Have you a pass Y" asked the officer, at
the same time glancing rather sharply at Bar-
ney.
The latter felt uneasy, for the face of the
officer seemed very familiar to him.
"Yes, sir-here's the pass. In course I
shouldn't sail without such a docyment-in
course not," said Riley, exhibiting the paper.

' Whatever pl ates you, dewr father, pleases

should govern his actions."
" Thank you, Miss Cora; that sense of duty
impels me to declhte the offer. The fortunes
of war are as various and changeable as the
wind, as my recent adventure shows. I may
be re-captured-I may escape-and if so, shall
at once be at liberty to again draw my sword
in the cause of freedom. But on my parole I
should be doomed d to stand idly by and see my
ountrymen struggling. for success, and have

my hands bound, though not with a-shackle
upon them. I prefer to endure imprisonment
and take the chances which fortune may throw
in my way."
Cora did not speak while she listened to his
remarks, but her beautiful eyes told him that
she appreciated his noble and honorable sen-
timents.
" Well, at least you can stay to dinner," said
the Alderman, not at all liking the araumenta
which indicated the coming loss of Barney's
Company.
"If Mr Morley thinks it compatible with
his duty, I shall not object," said Barney.
"We have the whole day before us," said
the English officer, 'and I certainly shall not
mar its pleasure by hurrying Lieut. Barney
away from such agreeable company. I have
several friends in the army whom I wish to
see, and I will call on them."
"Oh, you must not leave us-you'must he,
one of our dinner party," said the Alderman.
" Water affording us so much pleasure in
bringing one friend to see us, it would be
really unkind, sir, not to give us a proper op-
portunity to thank you," said Cora, blushing
beneath the adrpiring but respectful gaze of
Morley.
"Many thanks, fair lady ; I will go for a
time, and return in season to partake of your
hospitality," said Morley. whose delicacy told
him that nothing would he more agreeable'to
Barn-y than a private interview with her
whom he loved.
" Capt Hurlhut presents his compliments,
and requests an interview with Mr. Bedlord'-
said a servant, entering at this moment.

"I hope from my heart, sir, that this war
will soon be over," said the young officer,
warmly. "It seems so unnatural to fight

who were born with the same affinities, who.
are used to the same customs !"
"Yes, sir," said the Alderman; "it is very

He w as introduced to Barney, but required

taken place, "to warn you to be on you- guard

wretch in company with several cut throat
looking -asals. tie was eunningly disguised,
but I snew the villain the moment I set my
eyes on him. We shall soon evacuate the city
with the army, and I shall not be able as now
to have a watch kept over your safety."
"Ill keep a suaderbuss for the rascal!"
said the alderman. "I'm getting strong now
-and if he hangs around afteryour army has
left, I'll have him arrested as a tory dog, sir,
and hung, if I can. Ah, captain, there were
three British institutions which have been
abolished in this country, which I admired
very much-very much, sir ; they were so ad-
mirably adapted to such fellows as that Elli-
ott. He was brought before me once in my
magisterial capacity, and I stated .then in
court, sir, my regret that I could only fine
him. But Barney had punished him already,
sir-,-had committed a justifiable assault and
battery on him. You remember it, don't you,
my lad?"
"Yes, sir," replied Barney-"not only be-
cause I inflicted a richly merited chastisement
on the villain, but because it was the occasion
of my introduction to-yourself and daughter."
As he spoke he glanced at Cora, with a look
which threw the rich blood up into her cheeks
up to her very temples.I
" May I asks Alderman, what those institu-1
tions were which you regretted had been abol-
ished?" asked Hurlbut
"The whipping-post, the ducking -stool and
the pillory, sair; Christian institutions, sir, in-
vented expressly for such seape-gallowsrascals
as;Elliott. Tnere are fellows, sir, who don't
care a rap for a fine or impriso ment ; but,
souse them under water, or give them forty,
save one, on the bare back, and you touch
their consciences, sir i"
"Is it probable that the army will move
from the city soon, air ?" asked Cora, timidly,

76

for she felt, mo' e than any other jinnoyed at
the vicinity of such a vile, unscrupulous vil-
lain as Elliott.
"We are under marching orders now, lady.
Probably to-morrow, or next day at the latest,
the column will move over into New Jersey.
His excellence the general has made no con-
cealment of his line of march, aid probably
we shall have a battle."
"Whatever may be its result-and I do not
deny that my wishes and prayers are on the
American side-I hope, sir, that you, who
have been so kind to us, will pass through it
unscathed," said Cora, in a tone of deep feel-
ing.
So. do I-so do I, sir. You are a gentle-
man, sir-one of my own school. I like you.
You must dine with us, sir, to-day- That ras-
cal Eiliott and his drunken guard made sad
havoc with my wine bin, but I have some
crusty old port left."
"I thank you from my heart, fair lady, and
you, kind sir, for youi good wishes and the
invitation. Were all rebels like you, I fear
that but little dependence could be placed on
our army--at least on the gentlemen in it. Un-
de' such temptations, I fear they would forget
their loyalty," and he bowed low to the love-
ly girl as he spoke.
"Don't flatter the girl, captain;" said the
Alderman; "I can't spare ber yet, and when
I do, I suppose that fellow Barney, there, will
take her under his wing. Oh, you needn't
blush so,-either of you!" And the Alderman
chuckled over the confusion which his off-
handed remark brought upon both of them.
"Envy is not a part of my nature, or I
should surely grudge the lieutenant so fair a
prize," said Morley, bound to have his oar in
the water. "But his lot carries out the poet's
thought-'none but the brave deserve the
fair.'"
Both officers (English) now rose, and, prom-
ising to return at dinner-time, left.
It would be rude and very uneourteous for
us, reader, to remain with Barney and his
lady love when we know that, both being
deeply in love, and wanting to tell each other
so, they would rather be alone ; so let us leave
them, and slide off somewhere else, and see
what our other characters are doing.

THE MAN-O -WAR'S-MAN'S GRUDGE.

CHAPTER XXXVIII.
THE TWO VILLAINS.

Tom Riley was not in very good humor
when he was set on shore Trom the Arethusa.
He had two causes to be put out-in fact three
of them. First, his trip and its consequent of
five hundred pounds in pocket was brought
to a sudden stop ; next, the vesselhaving been
taken from him by Barney and his crew, and
retaken by the boat from the Arethusa, was
now held as a lawful prize to the frigate ;
lastly, as the ministers sometimes say, he had
received more kicks than half-pence, more
curses than blessings, while aboard the vessel:
for men-o'-war's-men don't like landlords, ex-
cept when they are ashore on a spree, and
during the entire Revolution tories were des-
pised even by those on whose side they fought
or acted. This is a notorious fact.
Riley was ready for a growl the moment he
entered his house. He had his lips set for it,
and only wanted a glass or two of his rum to
set nim going.  In fact, the article which he
kept for his common run of customers would
have made a deacon growl just before a good
dinner.  But the individual whom he left in
charge when he started on his trip gave him
no time for an outburst, for as soon as he ert-
tered, that worthy, who was seated on a bar-
rel-head, and who evinced no surprise what-
ever at his unexpected appearance-in fact,
"One-sided Jack" was never known to evince
surprise at anything-jerked the stump of his
left arm toward the door of the inner room,
and said :
"There's a chap in there that's been goin'
on awful about you. You hadn't better go
in "
"Hadn't better go in, eh ?  If he was the
devil himself, I'd go in now! I never wanted
a fight so bad in my life ! Give me a pint mug
of that old brandy, you lop-sided curse!"
Jack squinted his one eye at Riley, grinned
all over one side of his face, and with his only
flipper drew the required liquor, which, though
it was fourth proof, being kept for his own
private use, Riley swallowed at a breath with-
out a wink. Then turning to the door, he
did not wait to open it according to his usual
custom, but kicked it open.
Dressed in a shabby suit, with a slouched
hat drawn down over his eyes, a cigar in his
mouth, and an empty glass before him, sat a
man whom Riley did not recognize.
"Who the h-1 are you, that's anxious for

a mues with Tom Riley ?" he cried, looking '
daggers through his one eye.
"Why, Tom, are you back? By Jove, I d
rather see you than a king !" cried the man,
springing to his feet. "Don't you know me,
man? Give me your hand !"
"Why, it can't be-no-yes, it is ! Is it
you, Master Harry ?" said Riley, scarcely be-
lieving the truth of vision in his one optic.
"Yes, it's me, Tom."
"And why don't you curse me-I've lost
your vessel!"
"D-n the vessels!"
"And the gal came ashore, too, as soon as
the frigate dropped her mud hook."
"The girl? why, you didn't carry her off !"
"Yes, but we did, though. I had her all
safe aboard, but the men I had turned out to
be d-d Yankees, under a chap that called
himself Lieutenant Barney. They took the
craft from us, and then, when we lay becalm-
ed under the guns of the Arethusa, she sent a
boat, and Barney had to give up."
"What kind of a looking girl was it that
you had on board ?" asked Elliott.
"Well, she was a little taller than common,
had a smart, saucy-lookin' face, and eyes as
black as a bottle, and twice as bright."
"Caroline Ormsley, by Jove ! her descrip-
tion to a dot !"
"Well, -we found her in bed in the very
room you told us to go to, and she never kick-
ed a kick nor squalled a squall when we. car-
ried her off."
"No-she had her own reasons for not re-
sisting. And you say she is on shore ?"
"Yes-came ashore with a crooked cub of
a nigger, afore I did."
"Then I must be on my guard. She is
more dangerous than fifty men, and she has
sworn to ruin me. She has well nigh done it
now."
"Why don't you split her wizzen, then?"
"I will, if ever I get her in my power
again."
"But why don't you wear your uniform?
What are you rigged out so shabby for?
That's the why I didn't know you."
"It's soo long a story to tell now. I've left
the king's service, and that girl is the cause
of it. And now I'll have revenge on both of
them. I'll humble the one and kill the other,
or die in trying it."

CHAPTER XXXIX.
A SOCIAL DINNER.

In olden times, dinners-that is, ceremonial
ones--were far more substantial than they are
now. People met in those days to eat
and to drink ; now-a-days they meet to
pay compliments, utter sentiments, and
make long-winded speeches.  On this occa-
sion, in honor of his guest, Alderman Bed-
ford was determined that nothing should
be wanting. Wisely leaving Barney and Cora
to pass the forenoon by themselves, he gave
directions in all matters appertaining to the
banquet. Therefore it may be supposed that
when Morley and Hurlbut arrived at two
o'clpck, the dining hour-the one used to the
hard fare of a sea-going ship, the other to the
exigencies of a mess table in war time--they
were not at all displeased to find a table lite-
rally laden down with fish, flesh. fowl, and
their accompaniments.  Both officers noted
that the faces of both Cora and Barney were
beaming with joy, when the jolly voice of the
alderman summoned them from an inner par-
lor to take a seat at the table. They evident-
ly had enjoyed the morning-probabty had
settled all the future which was at their dis-
posal-for we know how thruthful is the
adage, "Man proposes, but God disposes."
"Fall to at once, gentlemen," said the Al-
derman.   "I'm a Christian man and a magis-
trate, but I leave the saying of 'grace' to the
parsons, whose trade it is. I never wait to
be fashionable. When I'm well, I eat because
it does me good and I like it ; when I'm sick,

I eat all I can to try and get better. Fall to,
Mr. Morley-and you, Captain Hlurlbut., We
can't expect much out of Barney and Cora,
there--but they'll have an appetite by-and-
bye. J can remember when I used to go hun-
gry ; it was when I went to see her mother at
first. I was afraid Lucy would think me pig-
gish, and I never ate a full meal at herFather's
house. But I got over that soon after we
were married-ha ! ha!   Lucy was a fine
girl-a noble woman ; knew to a turn how to
roast beef, and could serve up a salmon fit for
a prince. A fine girl was my Lucy. Cora is
just as she used to be." And the old Alder-
man heaved a deep sigh at the remembrance.
"Is there any news of the proposed move-
ment which it is riot wrong to impart to a
prisoner, Captain Hurlbut ?" asked Barney.
"There is news, my dear sir, which, con-
sidering your present position, must be anyy
thing but pleasant. The army will move to-
morrow or next day-as soon as the vessels
and transports have gone down the river. I
presume, from what I heard at headquarters,
that you and some few other prisoner's whom
we have will be sent around to New York in a
transport, under convoy, there to remain until
you are exchanged, which last I most cordial-
ly wish would soon happe, though I hope
we may never meet except as friends."
"I hope we may not, although if we do, I
beg you, spare not a blow in memory that we
have met before."

SHE MAN-O'-WAR'8-MAN S GRUDGE.
^CHAPTEIPT.
AT SEA IN A TPEMP3SaT.-

The report-this time wan true in regard to
the evacuation of the city, although the British
gdnaeal had materially altered his plane. Tatie
was necessary for two reasons. As the season
advanced, Washington's forces, weakened by
the severe and inclement weather, now began
to recruit and strengthen, and it was pretty
certainly known that a heavy French squadron
was off the coast. His route now was laid
across New Jersey, over the eventful field of
Monmouth, where, on the twenty-eighth of
June, though not literally defeated, he was so
severely punished tha' he was glad to draw off
under cover of the night, and effect a rapid re-
treat, whine Washington and his forces slept
upon the battle field. But any of you can
read history-I'll.corn back to my story.
On the next morning after the dinner des-
cribed in the preceding chapter, Barney, with
his own men and ten or twelve other pris-
oners, was tran'erred from the frigate to the
armed transport schooner Cricket. The offi-
cers of the Arethusa, who had even in that
time become attached to him, parted with him
with regret. He was so youthful, so sincere,
yet so unostentatious in his patriotism, and his
courage was so well known, that men 'f cbiv-
airy and honor could not avoid liking him.
Morley, his captor and friend, became espe-
cially attached to him. But the parting words
were said, and the transfer was made.
Barney, on looking around him when he got
on board the Cricket, found that his comfort
was not increased, either in accommodations
or society, by his transfer from the Arethusa.{
The Cricket, though built fora fast sailor, was
quite overloaded. In addition to her fault crew
of tweaty men, she had a guard of twenty-five
marines on board to take care of the prisoners.
Her cabin accommodations were very poor,
She was commanded by a bull-headed, rum-
bloated man named Seraggs, who had been
turned out of the regular service, after he had
attained a lieutenancy, for drunkenness and
quarrelsome habits. As might be supposed,
tie was as near a brute as any two-legged talk-
ing animal could be. He was endurable only
when about half drunk, and it was seldom he
wa' so near sober as that.
His first officer, Mr. Marge, tried to imitate
his superior, as far as he could-te did so in
drunkenness and tyranny, butlacked the cour.
?g of   oraggs.  The other mate. Mr. Nims,
was a meek and hum le individual, who did
iot grumble at any extra duty put upon him

by the others, and who, to their infinite die-
gust, always put water in his grog. He was
a very good navigator, and eaved the other
two the trouble of keeping the vessel's reek-
oning. He was a very useful officer on board;
especially because both his superiors were
often too drunk to do duty. He never got
"over the bay," spiritually speaking.
The other occupant of the cabin, beside
Barney, was Lieutenant Sponge, of the Royal
Marines, who had especial charge of the ma-
rines. He was a "sea sojer" and nothing else.
If you want to know what one of them is, go
ask the first man-o-war's-man that you meet.
All these officers were on deck when Bar-
ney was brought alongside in the Arethusa's
boat. When he stepped on deck, acconpan-
ied by Morley, Barney at a glance took in
their respective characters. Morley at once
proceeded to-introduee Barney to Scraggs and
his officers, anA closed by hepinsr that they
would make his time as agreeable as they
could, for though a prisoner and an enemy,
they would find him very agreeable company,
and a gentleman.
"Gentleman or no gentleman, he's got to
rough it as wc do aboard the.Cricket I'' growl-
ed Seraggs.
"And we do rough itl" added Maggs. "No
grub except rusty pork and horse beef--no
lush except weak rum!"
"Bad cheese and no porter !" added Lieut.
Sponge.   "What are those things coming
aboard from your boat, Mr. Morley ?"
" Some wine, brandy, and other stores for
Lieut Barney," said tie officer.
" Oh,-we'll find plenty of roonito stow them.
in the cabin!" said the lieutenant, eyeing the
various articles as if he considered them al-
ready his own property.
"Aye, and in our read basketsI" growled
Seraggs.  "I suppose it'll be mess property
if the Yankee officer messes with us I'
"Certainly," said Barney, determined to
keep on friendly terms with all -parties, if he
'could.
Morley now took a very affectionate leave
of Barney, and shoved off, the other prisoners
being on board, and a general signal up for all
the vessels to weigh and stand down the river.
"That Leftenant is confounded sweet on
you, seem' that he's a king's officer, and you're
a rebel 1" growled Scragga to Barney, after
the Arethusa's boat had gone.
"Quite friendiy-as I hope you and I will

That s seisible-you must he a devilish

-N' rr !" replied Barney, who knew his
customer by that very question.
" Give me your fist, my hearty I" cried
Saraggs, holding out a hand which looked like
a boiled lobster covered with   barnacles.
" You're no milk sop. There's Nims, my
second mate, half-waters his grog.  He isn't
any manner of account. except he's very good
in navigatin'.  I don't bother with that non-
sense 14
"Well, sir. we'll go below and open a bottle
of that brandy-will you join us, Lieutenant
Sronge '"
"Yankee, I don't drink often," replied the
soldier, "but when I do, it's just about this
tune of day.'
"And 3 ou. Mr. Magga, will not you ioin

"If you've got rum, I will.  You needn't
asa Nirrs, there--be don't care for greg, no

ready to getunder way," replied the first mate.
Toe four now went below, and when they
came up, some ten minutes alter, all hands,
r ecially Scraggs and Maggs, seemed to be in
r x,' int humor.
Tie brt'ze was tolerably stiff, and blowing
fairly Mown the river.  In the course of an
'or roorly every vessel wasunderway, stand-
ing down. making a very pretty show with
their snowy sails, moving along through the
nmootlh water like a graceful flock of swans
Deily lolen as she was, the Cricket not
rily lhbl xuay with all the rest, but forged
ahea i of omust of them. She was rigged with
a square foretopsail and tppgallant sail, and
carried t opmsst and lower stein' sails. She
tal silei under the American flag, out of
Baltimore, after the commencement of the
war, but was captured soon after, and had
l'en turn' I 'ver to the transport service.
Barnc', ' imen, with the other prisoners, were
eomnticed I"lw, a guard being placed at the
liatchwav t prevent their coming on deck
without piierusion.  There were, all told,
mioeteen rrsmere on board, beside himself.
Amd X\t, Ulariey, with the daring which ever
e'tara,'t"rzed hmni, determined, if there was
tin' souhtet opening, to attempt a recapture
cf the clonrer, although her crew, guard and
eer. miiered forty-nine men all of whom
re we armed. He had retained, unkno wn
. ,i E  me -rs of the Aretlhusa, and of course
'.'ie wI 1o tbose on boardlthe Trans1ort,ihe
rue2mil pair of pistols, and a k'en-bladed
Oagrr which he had provided himself with
beforee he entered into the service of Riey.
The weapons being small, were easily conceal-
ed, Tuey were, however, large enough to be

used with deadly effect, at close qu tr rs.
Each of the men who had been with iin o
board the  Mary," had been similarly provi-
ded; and, although he had not been a le to
communcate with them unobserved, he b' e1
they also had been able to keep their weapons
in their possession. If so, by their aid, i an
opportunity should offer, it was barely possi-
ble, though the chances were desperate against
so many well armed and watchful men, that
he might succeed in catching them at a disad-
vantage. But sailing in company with other
vessels, under convoy which would notice in
an instant any change in her course, or dis-
turbance on board, the thought seemed akin
to madness   Yet there are some men who
thrive best on difficulties, and who, though
they often fail in ordinary matters, always suc-
cceed in things which look impossible.
The vessels made good headway down the
river, and the day passed very agreeably, for
Barney was free with his stores, of which he for-
tunately had a good stock, and even Scragga,
brutal as he was, treated the "d-d Yansee"
with a great deal of kindness, in his way. So
did Sponge.   After getting so tight that he
could hardly stand straight, he turned out his
guard on the quarter-deck, and put them
through the manual, just to please Barney,
whom he declared to be a tip-top fellow. He
said he would have made afirst-rate royal ma-
rine, and regretted that he was a rebel.
It was night before the vessels cleared the
bay.   As tney sighted the open sea between
Henlopen and Cape May, they saw not that
which they had rather feared, a blockading
French squadron. But in a low blue bark of
clouds that lay in the northeast, they saw the
certainty of a head wind, and a very strong
prospect that it would be anything but one of
those "gentle zephyrs" which love-sick lads
and lasses talk about.
In preparation for this, many of the vessels
began to shorten sail, send down ligh spars,
etc. Perhaps this might have been done on
board the Cricket, had not the secondti mate,
Nims, suggested it  When he did so, Scraggs
d-d him for a white-livered milk sop, and swore
that if the Cricket couldn't carry her spars,
she should drag them.
Barney watched the weather with a great
deal of interest. In case of a heavy gale, the
Cricket right get separated from the rest of
the fleet, and that would add to his chances.
Sponge. as long as he had plenty to eat and
drink, didn't care whether a gale came on or
not--he had no watch to keep-nothing to do
with the working of the vessel.
By midnight the fleet was fairly at sea close'
haued on a wind, and, according to order,
pretty well together, as could be seen by the
lights here and there seen rising and falling on
the heaving waters. The gale had risen rapid-
ly. and seemed to increase every hour.  The
square sails of the Cricket had been taken in,

although Scraggs held on to them until she
almost buried herself in the head sea which
pitched in from the northeast. She was now
under her main sail, foresail and jib, and these,
without a reef, were evidently too much for
her.
" Hadn't I better take in a single reef, sir ?"
said Nimns to Scraggs, in a very humble man-
ner.
"Go to hell, you water-drinking lubber,
with your reefs.  Why, it don't blow hard
enough to take the fleas off from a Jamaica
niggers hide!' shouted Seragga. "Carry on
her till I tell you to take in a reef!"
"It is going to be rather a rough night,
captain," said Barney ; "suppose we take a
little more of that brandy t"
"It is a going' to blow a good whole sail
breeze, I s'pect-brandy won't hurt none to-
night !" said Scraggs, softening down.
"Won't you join us, Lieutenant Sponge ?"
asked Barney.
"I don't know but that I might with pro-
priety,'' replied Sponge; "it is seldoni that I
drink at night, but if I do, it is generally about
this time."
If it should come on to blow harder, and
you should need the services of any of my
men, Captain Scraggs, I am sure they could
be depended upon," said Barney.
"Aye-may be so-butI've got men enough
of my own ; d-d lazy beef-eating lubbers.
It takes me and Magge to knock the work out
of 'em.  Nims isn't of any account.  I never
knew a man 4tat watered his grog that was."
"Mr. Maggs, were going below to freshen
the nip, won't you join us ?" asked Barney, of
the last mentioned officer, who, with a pipe in
his mouth, was walking the deck.
"Don't care if I do," said Maggs, with a
pleasant growl, looking as kind as a big bull-
dog when you heave him a piece of meat.
"I'm like old Sponge there-I don't drink
often-that is, never except when I'm dry-and
if I do, it is'generally about this time !"
"Oh, you needn't be laughing at me, Maggs,
I haven't taken more than twenty nips to-day,
and I swear you're at least about half a dozen
a head of me !"
"Bless yoa, I ought to be-I've got more
stowage room below !" said Maggs, bringing
his huge paw down upon his abdomen with a
slap, as if to shake do on the contents and
make more room.
The party now went below, and Nims walk.
ed the deck alone.  Being alone he indulged
in a soliloquy. And it ran thus:
"Swig-swig!     There they go!  There's
nothing' ever softens Scraggs ormellows Maggs,
but rum. As water is to oil, so is rum to
them.   I oughtn't to grumble when they
drink-it makes the times easier for me.
While they're drinking' they aren't growlin'--
while they're pitehin' into the liquor they
forget to pitch into me. I wonder if ever I'll

get aboard of a better craft than this. The
craft is good enough-but Scragga is the devil,
and Maggs is his mate. I've Hearn tell that
there is a difference betwixt hell and purga-
tory. I guess the last craft I was in was pur-
gatory, for it was a little easier there than
here. Thunder how it blows. I'll wager a
pound of tobacco agin a quart o' rum, that
that foresail goes out of the bolt ropes afore
long."
At that moment, rip-rip went the sail,
tearing into ribbons in a moment.
"Tobaceojwins !" said Nims, coolly, as he
put his head down the companion way of the
cabin, and shouted-
"The foresail's blown away, Cap'n Scragge!"
"Let it go and be d-d !" growled Scraggs,
in a deep basso from below. "It's a pity you
didn't go with it !" added Maggs.
"If I had, there'd be more work for you!"
growled Nims, as he turned and admired the
ripping propensities of the gale, as it finished
up the foresail. "It saves work a reefin, or
a gettin' of it!"
The vessel was much relieved by the loss of
the foresail.' and made better weather of it
now, although she still had more canvas
than she ought to carry under the circum-
stance. But she was so deeply laden that she
did not heel to the wend as she would had she
been lighter, and "therefore seemed more able
to bear it.
For hour after hour, even after the watch
was changed, Nims paced the deck, stopping
occasionally to listen to the sounds of song
and shout and laughter that came up from
below, tokening the manner in which the oc-
cupants of the cabin were enjoying them-
selves.
"I'm a thinkin'," muttered Nims, ' that that
Yankee officer thinks he is keen, and can
drink them fellows drunk.  Wiy, he might
just as well try to fill a leaky cask, as to get
enough into Maggs or Seraugs.   And as to
the sojer-he soaks it in just like any other
Sponge!"
At last, however, the songs and laughter
grew more faint, and finally only an occa-
sional word came to his ear, and then it was
sure to ne aeeompaned by the clink of glasses.
It was nearly morning, and Nims began to
feel so weary that he thought of running the
risk of a cursing from Maggs, by asking him
to come on deck and relieve him, when, to his
utter astonishment, Barney came up from the
cabin, in a perfectly sober state,
"It is blowing very fresh, Mr. Nims," said
the latter, glancing to windward.
"Yes, sir, blown' great guns-it carried our
foresail clean out of the bolt ropes--didn't
have a yard of canvas to swear by. Isn't
-Mr. Maggs coming on deck soon, sir ?"
"I hardly think he will. I left him and
Captain Scraggs hugging each other very lov-
ingly under the tale."

THE MAN-O'-WAR S-MAN'S GRUDGE

I remember once when I was in Charleston,
S. C., hearing a French gentleman" all of the
olden school," telling another where he had
passed the evening before. Said he :
"I was wiz one varee select companie. Zere
was Shack Miller, and Shon Shenkins and
Monsieur Delaplan and myself-Von varee se-
lect companie I"
The City Marshal, who was taking. a smil
with me at the French coffee-house on "the
bay," remarked, sotto voce, "Four more accom-
plished villians couldn't be raked up in the
city."
So, on the same principle, "a very select
company" was assembled in the back room of
Tom Riley's groggery, on the second night
after the city had been evacuatedby the Brit-
ish. Although it was scarcely yet midnight,
the front door, which was usually kept open
nearly all night, was carefully closed, as were
also the window blinds.
A large table was set in the room, and upon
it stood several bottles and glasses-and over
it also were strewed a variety of weapons.
There was the deadly and dastardly slung'shot
-the keen double edged Spanish dagger-the
three-cornered Italian stiletto-the heavy and
dangerous looking English sheath knife. Pis-
tols, too, of various kinds and sizes,were there.
And a rough, lawless looking set of despera-
does were the owners of these weapons Elli-
ott, still disguised, was there, a scowl of fiend
ish hate resting on his face. Tom Riley pre-
sided at the head of the table. "One-Sided
Jack" acted as steward, while the rest of the
company, seven in number, looked as if they
had been sent up from below, by the devil, to
perform some foul deed at his especial bidding.
They appeared to have come from all quarters
of the globe. One was a huge, repulsive loo t-
ong negro. A cut, reaching from his temple
clear down to his chin, had laid the flesh open,
and left a broad white scar. His great eyes
looked red, as if they were stained with blood,
and when he opened his mouth it looked more
like that of some carniverous animal than that
of a human being. His hair was grizzled, and
he boasted of being one of those fiendish
wretebes who, in a recent revolt in the West
India Islands, had butchered a large, number
of women, after perpetrating the most horrid
enoraities, having first slain their defenders.
He was one of Lhe few wh.' hid escaped the
tearful fate-of the others who had been burned
ahve--he having, after being wounded, fled to
the muntaiius, where he remain'-d until he had
an opportunity of joining a.pira-ieal vessel,

which ran into an unfrequented cove in search
of fresh water.
At the time which I take of introducing this
very setect company to the reader, this fero-
cious monster was relating, with the greatest
gusto, the 'fearful deeds in which he had par-
ioipated. And lhe charter of his auditors
may best be judged, when it is stated that they
listened with gusto to his horrid details, ap-
plauding as he described the struggles of beau-
tiful, despairing maidens in the power of
wretches like himself. Oh, God, how depraved
and heartless man can be ! Often I sicken in
describing his depravity, and yet never do I
overstep that which I know to have been.
"Fill up-fill up, hearties ! It'll soon be
time for us to be on the move !" cried Riley.
"Yes," said Elliott, draining a glass filled
to the brim with brandy, "and remember, boys,
a rich prize is before you-the old man has
lots of gold stowed away, and a large service
of silver plate !"
"I envy you 'the prize the most, oap'n !"
said the hideous negro; "that is, if she's as
han'some as you say she is !"
"Pretty ? There isn't a handsomer girl on
the continent-such a form, full and voluptu-
ous as that of Cleopatra-eyes large and I -
trous as those of a gazelle-lips like  aw-
berries bursting with ripeness-a skin softer
and fairer than the leaf of a fresh blown lily I"
Oti, how the red eyes of the coarse negro'
gloated as he listened to Elliott's impassioned
description.
" You'll remember your promise,cap'n!" he
said : " you'll remember your promise about
her!"
"Yes-yes-it will',just satisfy my revenge
after I've spurned her a ruined, debased crea-
ture from my feet. Yes, Domingo; you, you
shall ha e her;, and I only wish that her lover
could be chained down within eight of you, as
you clasp her, shrieking, to' your arms !"
"Fill up once more. and we'll be off !"
shouted Riley. "Here's to our noble cap'n !"
"Here's to the captain--here's, to the-eap-
tam!" cried all the rest.
Elliott arose and thanked them.
"Men!" said he, 'you have chosen me for
a leader, and you will fled . in me one who
never will flinch in any daring or damnable
work. It was not the want of money atat
made me seek you out and jon your band. I
had enough and more thin enough. I sought
revenge and ( will have it. Tots night I begins
the work. But while L seek revenge for my

There is plenty of gold and plate in the house
which we enter to-night. Of that I shall not
touch a single ounce for my own use !"
"Bravo, captain I" Hurrah for our noble
captain !"
"No,.I seek, as I said, revenge I" All I want
is the girl, and her I'll have, or die in the trial.
You have sworn to obey me--to follow my
leading 1"
"Yes, to hell's gates, if you'll take us
there 1" shouted the negro.
"I trust to you all. This night is but the
commencement of our work-after my hand
is once in, you'll see that, like the lion which
has once tasted human blood, there will be no
stay to my appetite. You shall revel ingold 1"
And beauty !" added the hideous black.
"And rum and tobacco shall be as plenty
as water in the river and chips in a ship-yard!"
added Riley.
"Now, my lads, I've said my say, arm and
we'll start,'' said Elliott, concluding, and swal-
lowing another glass of brandy.
Each one now assumed his weapons and ar-
ranged his disguise, and then Elliott imparted
his plan.
"I've secured one of the servants, by a
heavy bribe," he said, and the door will be
open to us. You know, Tom Riley, where the
old man sleeps. You take two of the men and

fix him. The strong chest is in his room. Do-
mingo and myself will get the girl. The other
four will stay and guard the door, and be
ready to cover our retreat. You'll remain
here, One-Sided Jack, ready to let us in with
plunder, and be sure to have the door of the
cellar vault open so that I can get the girl in
quickly if we are followed."
"All right, eap'n I I'll be on hand," said
the cripple.
"Do you all fully understand my plan ?"
asked Elliott.
"All-all!" was the reply.
"Then follow me, but go still and keep scat-
tering till we reach the house. And remember
if there is any resistance, use steel; don't fire
a pistol to alarm the neighborhood, if you
can help it."
The party now gathered in the outer room,
and, let out by the cripple, departed one by
one, from the door. After the last one had
gone, " One-Sided Jack" closed the door.
Then, from close under the eaves of tb'
house, where the shadow was dense, two per-
sons glided noiselessly out, and followed in the
rear of the gang of desperadoes.
The night was dark, for there was no moon,
and a strong south-easterly breeze swept a dark
and heavy mass of clouds in from sea-ward.

"Good-night!" Flow sweetthose two words
sound from dear lips, when you know that, Un-
like the sad farewell, it only meansau revoir
for a little time. When you expect, your self
refreshed by 'rialmy sleep, nature's sweet re-
storer," so 2n again to meet the beloved one,
more radiant more cheeriol than ever. How
sweet the god night kiss exchanged between
brother anu sister, between parent and child.
Ho w holy the blessing invoked from Heaven
when t+e aged lay their feebleh ands upon the
heads of tie young, and with that blessing and
prayer nid them  go to rest. Reader, always
p         say good night to teose whom you love before
you retire to slumber, for you know not that
you may wake to bid them good morning.
Never did Cora look more beautiful than
when she bent her lovely head to kiss her dear
father's brow, before she retired for the night.
11cr dark tresce, shining like the glossy down
from a raven's breast, mingled with his white
hairs, and her red lips touched his forehead,
like a red rose bowing on its stem to kiss a lily.
4         And her voice was full of melody as she ten-
derly said .
-Good night, my dear father."
"God bless thee, Cora, my darling," was his
response, as be pressed her light and grace-
ful form to his bosom. "May the good angels
guard thee !"
Then, accompanied by Eliza, she retired to
her chamber.
"I do not feel sleepy, yet it is time that I
b        retired," she said to Eliza, as she seated her-
self in the room.
I wonder where the poor lieutenant is
now ?" said Eliza. "Oh, how I did hate to see
him go."
"He is probably on the ocean now. And
the wind blows fearfully. Yet why should I
fear that the elements would harm him, when
man is more cruel ?"
'There's one comfort, Miss Co, a."
" What's that. Eliza." asked the mistress.
" He isn't alone in his trouble's ma'am. Jim
Thompson, bless his noble heart, told me the
night we tied the corporal, that he'd stick to
him till it blew great guns-and that means
always, for I don't believe that the wind will
ever blow great guns, or the rain rain pitch-
forks, though people do talk about such
things-f
4"Thompson is, 'indeed, a fine fellow, Eliza,

and very devoted to Mr. Barney, but, poor
fellow, he too is a prisoner, and cannot help
himself. We must have patience-they will
be released some time."
"Patience, Miss Cora! I thin we've been
tried hard enough.  It needed more patience
than ever Job had to get along when those sol-
diers were in the house. Patience is like good
fortune, it isn't every one that is blessed with
it, though, for my part, I believe I'm the most
patientest crea'ure on this sublunary spear.
You never see me get into tantrums, do you,
Miss Cora?-not even when      he chimney
smokes."
"Not often,my good Eliza--you are a kind,
even-tempered girl."
"I thought you'd say that of me, Miss Cora.
Shall I fix you for bed ?"
"Yes, if you like, Eliza, although I do not
feel sleepy."
"How sweet you do look, Miss Cora," said
Eliza, after she had finishedthe night toilet of
her beautiful mistress. Then she kissed her
lily hand, and, bidding her good night, departed
to her own room.
And Cora knelt down to pray. How beau-
tiful is prayer ! The kneeling of those who,
though weak, and frail, and mortal, are made
in His.image who is immortal. The looking
up from this earth, which, with all its beauties,
is still dark and sin laden, to the bright spirit
land where angels sing His praises for ever-
more ; looking up and feelieg that great above
all greatness, powerful above ail power,.bright
above all brightness, and good above all good-
ness, though tie e, yet le bends His benign
ear to the petitions of the humblest being who
kneels upon His footstool.
And Cora knelt in her white robes to pray
for herself and for those whom she loved. Like
a low gush of melody rolling on the breeze of
even from off the strings of an reolian harp did
her sweet whisperings fill that room.
Who beta fiend from hell itself could regard
her, in her spiritual beauty, in her parity, save
with hallowed thoughts, thoughts as near akin
to adoration as may be given to anything that
is earthly.
She has closed bher prayer-she rises-she
approaches her couch--she turns down the
snowy coverlets Hark ! She hears a footstep
-a stealthy one.. Her door opens-she turns
and beholds--Elliott, and a huge and hideous
negro!

Nims heaved a deep sigh, and repeated the
following verses :
"There was a flower, the fairest one
That evermet my eye-
There was a stir, which seemed alone
To gem for me the sky-
There was a hope, to which I clung
Most fond and fervently-
There was aname, which on my tongue
Alone was melody.
"But ah ! that flower now is worn
Upon another's breast-
The hope is from my bosomtorn,
Which once that bosom blessed-
The star which once above me shone
Now lights my path no more-

So I to them, and pray.

They had now almost arrived at the house,
when a shriek-a wild, shrill shriek, that
pierced their very hearts-came ringing'on the
air.
"My God, 'tis from her'ihanber ! Draw,
Nims, if you are a man, and follow        me"
shouted Barney, as he bounded forward. The
door of the house was open, and armed men
were there, as Barney sprung to ward it, but
they were already engaged. Two shots were
fired as Barney rushed up the steps, and he
saw a sword flashing in the hands of one who
sought to enter. In a moment that one would
have fallen by his hand, but by the'fashof a
pistol he recognised Caroline Ormsley,. even
though she was in male attire.
"You here, Miss Ormsley 1" he exclaimed,
as he drove his sword through the man who
opposed her.
"On, Barney! on, and save her you love !
Elliott is up stairs I" she cried, as she fell back,
wounded, into the arms of Nims, who was
close behind him.
Shriek after shriek reached Barney-s ago-
nized ear. . Pushing aside with his naked left
arm a murderous blow which was aimed at
his heart, he clove another opposer down, and
rushed up the stairs.
Wild was his shout as hd sprang through
the open door of Cora's chamber, and saw the
poor, girl, with torn dress and dishevelled 'hair,
madly struggling in the arms of Elliott and
the fiendish negro, who were striving to bind
and gag her.
The negro turned as he heard that shout,
and his red eyes glared like balls of fire as he
drew   his knife and rushed toward Barney.
But he had looked his last look' A ball from
Barney's pistol crashed through his'brain, and

with a fearful howl he sank at Barney's feet
ere he could reach him.
Elliott dropped his intended victim, and,
drawing his sword, sprang witiafrenzied yell
of hate to ward Barney. The latter, eager to
meet him, rushed forward ; but the negro,
in his dying agony, caught him by the
foot, and he fell headlong to the floor. At that
instant the report of a blunderbuss below fair-
ly shook the house ; but it did not drown the
yell of triumph which rose from Elliott's lips
as he raised his sword to strike a death-blow
home to the heart of his defenseless foe.
But a flash, a ringing shot, and his upraised
arm fell powerless at his side.
"That shot.was mine, Henry Elliott-mine
mine! I am revenged !" shrieked Caroline
Ormsley, as she staggered forward and fell
down at his feet. With glaring eyes he look-
ed at her one instant, then pressed his hand
to his heart, through which the ball had pass-
ed, and fell dead at her side, without uttering a
word. Her life-blood was mingling with his.
In an instant Barney was on his feet ; the
next moment he was by the side of Cora, and
-had raised her in his arms.
"Saved-:saved-thankGod !" she murmur-
ed, and fainted in his arms.
"Mc' daughter-my daughter-where is
Cora?' shouted the Alderman, rushinglinto the
room in his night-clothes, carrying in his hand
by the barrel a blunderbuss, the shattered and
bloody butt of which told that he had not
been idle.
"She is safe. Are you hurt, sir?" cried
Barney ; "you are bleeding"
"Only a scratch, my boy. There were two
of 'em, but I did 'em both-d----u 'em, I did

job. And a big nigger-bah I And a young lad
--a handsome one ; what could have brought
him here? All dead 1"
"Father, are you safe ?" asked Cora, faintly,
recovering partially.
-  Yes, my chick; and Barney's safe, and
you're safe, "and I don't care if all the rest of
the world is dead-d-----d if I do ! Good
Lord, forgive me for swearing, but I'm so
happy !"
The old Alderman now embraced both Bar-
ney and his daughter, at one moment laugh-
ing and the next crying.
Barney disengaged himself, for he now be-
thought himself of Nims ; but at that moment
he entered, his sword red with blood, and a
bad gash in his cheek.
"They're are all gone, or down, sir," he said.
I "One got away, but I couldn't help it-I
marked him"
"Bravo. Nims ! hereafter you are a brother
to me," cried Barney.

CHAPTER XLIV'

It was a few days later. In that house
wherein such a fearful scene of bloodshed os-
curred as was described in the last chayter, a
joyous party was assembled, composed en-
tirely of those with whom the readers have
already become familiar, and for whom, I
hope, they have nourished some friendly feel-
ing.   ..                     e
It was in thelarge old dining hail that the
party was assembled, and it consisted of the
old Alderman, Barney and his, betrothed,
Nims, in a new American uniform, Eliza, the
faithful maid of Cora, and last, but not least,
honest, brave, faithful Jim Thompson.
The Aldermanwas in his glory. Seated in
his favorite arm-chair, he held a brimming
goblet in his hand, and drank "Joy, happi-
ness, to all around him.
"Barney," he cred, "you deserve my
Cora; take tier, God bless you, and make her
agood buband, the has been anaffectionate,
good daughter, and I know she'll make you a
loving wife."
"I am sure she will, and I will try to de-
serve her !" said Barney, as he pressed her
dear hand to his manly lips.
"And, Thompson, I suppose you'll get
spliced, as you sailors say, to Eliza there.
Well, I-ll do the job for you for nothing."
" I'd like that very well, your honor," 'said
Thompson, looking at Eliza, who sat blushing
like a peony-'I'd like it very well, for Miss
Eliza is built like a clipper, and I've no doubt
wo'ild sail like one over the sea of married
life ; but I've got neven little reasons, and one
big one, why her and me can't be spliced."
" What are they?" asked tae Alderman,
while Eliza turned pale, and looked as if she
was about to faint.
"Why, your honor, if the truth must be
told, I've got a fat wife and seven children
now, and it wouldn't be exactly right for

to take a nice al like Miss Eliza in tow afore
t'other one had slipped her cable."
Eliza looked as if she would indeed faint
now, but Barney brought the blushes back to
her cpeek, and perhaps hope to her heart once
more, as he said:
"There's my noble friend Nims in want of
a wife, Eliza--you shall not go husbandless. I
know that he has a good heart, and will make
a first-rate husband."
"I'd try to, if only to please you, my kind
benefactor," said Nims ; "that is, if the lady
has no objection."
"I'm afraid Miss Cora can't spare me," said
Eliza, smiling through her tears and blushes.
"Oh, yes, in such a case, Eliza," said those
joyous Cora, "and wish you many years of
unalloyed happiness."
Eliza thought at once that a single officer
was a better match than a married seaman, and
when Nims took hold of her hand, she did not
withdraw it.
A few days later still, and Jim Thompson,
as a special friend and favorite, was allowed
to dance at a double wedding.
And now, reader, my tale is one. The
name of Barney belongs to history ; it is a
proud relic of his country. His after deeds
upon the water, his heroic conduct at Bladens-
burg are recorded in letters of glory which
the hand of time, unsparing as it is, can never
efface while the name of one hero of the Revo-
lution is remembered. From his marriage
with the fair daughter of Alderman Bedford,
sprang some of the best stock which now ex-
ists in this city and that of Baltimore. His
honored name, borne by a descendant, still
graces our naval register; and if the ancient
grudge is again to be worked up between us
and the old country, I doubt not but that the
blood will be found as good as ever.

A description of one scene, and I have fin-
ished. It was the first day of December, 1818.
Where the rapid Monongahela rushes impet-
uously into the virgin embrace of the silvery
Alleghany, and, united as 'two hearts in one,"
they under the beautiful name of Ohio roll off
toward the fathomless ocean, a Christian and
a hero lay upon his death bed. The cold win-
ter winds were sweeping over the rushing
waters and snow-flakes filled the air ; but hot
tears were gushing out from fond eyes upon
his bosom, and kind words from dear lips were
cheering up his spirit as it plumed its wbite
wings for departure to a better world.
"Cora-dear Cora," muttered the dying
man. "you have been a blessed angel to me,
through life ; weep not at my departure-you
will soon follow me. Bring up our children
in the path which I have trod ; tell themto be
true to their country and their God. I've play-
ed with death many a time, my love-have
slipped out of his grasp very often; he has an
old grudge against me, and mist take it out."
He died, beloved by all who knew him-re-
speeted even by his foes.
Itmay appear vain in the author to append

the following statement, but if so he cannot
help it for it is one of the few occurrencessin
his life that he is proud of.
In 1844, just after retiring by voluntary re-
signation from the navy, he started a literary
magazine in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. On one
occasion, during the spring of that year, while
walking through the old graveyard of the
---church of thatcity, he stumbled over a
broken and sunken slab of marble, half cover-
ed with the grass which had atready grown
up rank above it. Upon looking at the in-
scription on the stone, he found that it rested
over the remains of Commodore Joshua Bar-
ney. Instantly publishing a notice of the ne-
glected state of the grave, and also writing a
biography of the hero, he called public atten-
tion to the matter, and did not rest until those
revered remains were removed to the City
Cemetery, and a monument worthy of the city
of his burial placed over him.
And now, dear readrs--you.who have had
the patience to follow me through this long
story-farewell. I hope, though I am an old
man-o-war'si-ian,you will not hold any grudge
against me.
